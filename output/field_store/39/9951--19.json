At this time, the truth on the guilty      should not be told openly, strange as this may seem, yet this is      policy. We must use precaution in bringing sinners to justice,      lest in exposing these heinous sins we draw the indignation of a      Gentile world upon us (and, to their imagination, justly too).      It is necessary to hold an influence in the world, and thus      spare ourselves an extermination; and also accomplish our end in      spreading the Gospel, or holiness, in the earth. If we were brought      to desolation, the disobedient would find no help. There are some      who are obedient, yet men cannot steady the ark--my arm cannot do      it--God must steady it. To the iniquitous show yourselves merciful.        I am advised by some of the heads of the Church to tell the Relief      Society to be virtuous, but to save the Church from desolation and      the sword; beware, be still, be prudent, repent, reform, but do      it in a way not to destroy all around you. I do not want to cloak      iniquity--all things contrary to the will of God, should be cast      from us, but don't do more hurt than good, with your tongues--be      pure in heart. Jesus designs to save the people out of their sins.      Said Jesus, \"Ye shall do the work, which ye see me do.\" These are      the grand key-words for the society to act upon. If I were not in      your midst to aid and counsel you, {21} the devil would overcome      you. I want the innocent to go free--rather spare ten iniquitous      among you, than condemn one innocent one. \"Fret not thyself because      of evil doers.\" God will see to it.    _Friday, 27_.--Had an attack of a bilious nature, stayed at home, took  some medicine.    _Saturday, 28_.--Convalescent. Walked to the store with Emma,  transacted some business in the city. At eight in the evening, called  at the printing office, with the night watch, to see the _Wasp_.    Violent shocks of earthquakes were experienced in Greece about this  time.    The High Council were in session, as they had been from day to day  through the week, investigating charges against various individuals  for unvirtuous conduct, committed through the teachings and influence  of John C. Bennett; several were cut off, and some were forgiven on  confession.    _Sunday, 29_.--I was at home; and about the city engaged in counselling  the brethren, &c., and also on Monday and Tuesday, the 30th, and 31st.    _Wednesday, June 1_.--I attended a political meeting in the grove, for  the nomination of county officers, for the county at large, in which I  concurred, with the exception of the candidate for the sheriffalty, and  spoke in favor of the proceedings.    A general conference was held in the Exchange, Manchester, England,  Elder Parley P. Pratt, presiding, at which 16 conferences were  represented, comprising 7,514 members, 220 Elders, 421 Priests, and 110  Teachers.    _Thursday, 2_.--Rode out with Brother Bowen and my clerk, and sold lot  1 in block 143.    The State of Michigan repudiated its debt for $2,350,000.    _Friday, 3_.--In the forenoon I rode out in the city, and sold to  Brother Harmer lot 1 in block 123, and in the afternoon rode to Brother  John Benbow's, on horseback, accompanied by Emma and others.    {22} _Saturday, 4_.--At the printing office in the morning, and  heard letters read from Grand Master Jonas, Dr. King and Mr. Helme,  concerning John C. Bennett's expulsion from the Masonic Lodge in Ohio.    In the afternoon paid E. B. Nourn $505 for land bought of Hugh McFall,  and settled with the heirs of Edward Lawrence at my house, assisted by  Newel K. Whitney and my clerk.    [Sidenote: Discourse by the Prophet.]    _Sunday, 5_.--I preached this morning to a large congregation. The  subject matter of my discourse was drawn from 32nd and 33rd chapters  of Ezekiel, wherein it was shown that old Pharaoh was comforted and  greatly rejoiced that he was honored as a kind of king devil over those  uncircumcised nations that go down to hell for rejecting the word of  the Lord, notwithstanding His mighty miracles, and fighting the Saints;  the whole exhibited as a pattern to this generation, and the nations  now rolling in splendor over the globe, if they do not repent, that  they shall go down to the pit also and be rejoiced over, and ruled  over by old Pharaoh, king-devil of mobocrats, miracle-rejecters,  Saint-killers, hypocritical priests, and all other fit subjects to  fester in their own infamy.    _Monday, 6_.--I rode on the prairie to view some land, accompanied by  Brother Yearsley and my clerk; dined at Brother Lot's, and returned  home; when I approved of a series of resolutions passed by a court  martial of the Nauvoo Legion.    _Tuesday, 7_.--Sold David D. Yearsley a quarter section of land. Quite  a snowstorm is reported in many parts of the New England and Middle  States.    _Wednesday, 8_.--I was about home. Sent Dr. Richards to Carthage on  business. On his return, old Charley, while on a gallop, struck his  knees and breast instead of his feet, fell in the street, and rolled  over in an instant, and the doctor narrowly escaped with his life. It  was a {23} trick of the devil to kill my clerk. Similar attacks have  been made on myself of late, and Satan is seeking our destruction on  every hand.    _Thursday, 9_.--At home, and about the neighborhood, attending to  domestic affairs, and the business of the Church.    _Minutes of Meeting of the Female Relief Society, at the Grove,  Nauvoo, June 9, 1842, (Reported by Miss E. R. Snow.)_        President Joseph Smith opened the meeting by prayer, and then      addressed the congregation on the design of the institution. Said      it is no matter how fast the society increases, if all the members      are virtuous; that we must be as particular with regard to the      character of members now, as when the society was first started;      that sometimes persons wish to crowd themselves into a society of      this kind when they do not intend to pursue the ways of purity and      righteousness, as if the society would be a shelter to them in      their iniquity.        He said that henceforth no person shall be admitted, but by      presenting regular petitions, signed by two or three members in      good standing in the society, and whoever comes in must be of good      report.        Objections having been previously made against Mahala Overton, they      were now removed; after which President Joseph Smith continued his      address; said he was going to preach mercy. Suppose that Jesus      Christ and holy angels should object to us on frivolous things,      what would become of us? We must be merciful to one another, and      overlook small things.        Respecting the reception of Sister Overton, President Joseph Smith      said: It grieves me that there is no fuller fellowship; if one      member suffer all feel it; by union of feeling we obtain power with      God. Christ said He came to call sinners to repentance, to save      them. Christ was condemned by the self-righteous Jews because He      took sinners into His society; He took them upon the principle that      they repented of their sins. It is the object of this society to      reform persons, not to take those that are corrupt and foster them      in their wickedness; but if they repent, we are bound to take them,      and by kindness sanctify and cleanse them from all unrighteousness      by our influence in watching over them. Nothing will have such      influence over people as the fear of being disfellowshiped by      so goodly a society as this. Then take Sister Overton, as Jesus      received sinners into His bosom. Sister Overton, in the name of the      Lord, I now make you free. Nothing is so much calculated to lead      people to forsake sin as to take them by the hand, and watch over      {24} them with tenderness. When persons manifest the least kindness      and love to me, O what power it has over my mind, while the      opposite course has a tendency to harrow up all the harsh feelings      and depress the human mind.        It is one evidence that men are unacquainted with the principles of      godliness to behold the contraction of affectionate feelings and      lack of charity in the world. The power and glory of godliness is      spread out on a broad principle to throw out the mantle of charity.      God does not look on sin with allowance, but when men have sinned,      there must be allowance made for them.        All the religious world is boasting of righteousness: it is the      doctrine of the devil to retard the human mind, and hinder our      progress, by filling us with self-righteousness. The nearer we      get to our heavenly Father, the more we are disposed to look with      compassion on perishing souls; we feel that we want to take them      upon our shoulders, and cast their sins behind our backs. My talk      is intended for all this society; if you would have God have mercy      on you, have mercy on one another.        President Smith then referred them to the conduct of the Savior,      when He was taken and crucified, &c.        He then made a promise in the name of the Lord, saying that that      soul who has righteousness enough to ask God in the secret place      for life, every day of their lives, shall live to three score years      and ten. We must walk uprightly all the day long. How glorious are      the principles of righteousness! We are full of selfishness; the      devil flatters us that we are very righteous, when we are feeding      on the faults of others. We can only live by worshiping our God;      all must do it for themselves; none can do it for another. How mild      the Savior dealt with Peter, saying, \"When thou art converted,      strengthen thy brethren.\" At another time, He said to him, \"Lovest      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60758"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 6 (#16)"],[1,"as      missionaries to the Sandwich Islands, and destitute of means to      help themselves. I could weep for them. I feel interested in this      great work. We are seeking to bring about a work that could never      before be performed.        When the time is brought about that we are to receive our      inheritances, the more faithful we are, the larger will be our      reward. We have come out to reap, but do we have time to reap new      grain? No; for it takes all our time to try to save that which is      already reaped.        We have reapers in the field, and we are trying to save the wheat.      We want to get it on the barn floor, so that we may thrash it.      We have come after it to warn you. You think Elder Young put the      flail on rather heavy; but it is nothing to be compared with the      thrashing you will get in Zion, and those who have the hardest      heads will, of {21} course, have to be thrashed the hardest. But      don't be troubled about the chaff when it comes to the barn, for      God will prepare a great winnowing mill which will blow all the      chaff away, and the wheat will be found before the mill: then it      has to go through the smut machine, then ground, then put through      the bolting machine, and many will bolt in going through. I speak      in parables. I compare the Saints to a good cow. When you milk      her clean, she will always have an abundance of milk to give; but      if you only milk her a little, and don't strip her, she will soon      dry up. So with the Saints: if they do but little in building up      Zion, they soon have but little to do with. This was the case in      Cincinnati.        The night before arriving at Cincinnati, I had a dream while on the      steamboat. I dreamt that I had a wagon with a rack on it, and an      individual with me. We were going to a field of wheat of mine that      had been cut, bound and shocked up, in order to haul into the barn.      When we came to the field, I jumped off the wagon, and got over the      fence to examine it, pulled off the cap sheaf, and behold it was      oats. Pulling the bundles apart, I found there were clusters of      rats. On further examination I found clusters of mice, and the oats      were all eaten up.        In my dream I was going to haul in wheat, but to my astonishment it      was oats, and they were all eaten up by the rats and mice.        I thought these rats and mice were the Elders and official members      who had been in and lain on the Church at Cincinnati--lived on the      wheat--eaten it up instead of building up new branches; so that      when the Twelve came along, they could not get anything for the      Temple or Nauvoo House, or hardly a place to stay. The rats had      eaten up the wheat, so we had to go to the world for a home to stay      while we were there.        We do not profess to be polished stones like Elders Almon W.      Babbitt, George J. Adams, James Blakeslee, and Eli P. Maginn, &c.,      &c.; but we are rough stones out of the mountain; and when we roll      through the forest, and knock the bark from the trees, it does not      hurt us, even if we should get a corner knocked off occasionally;      for the more we roll about, and knock the corners off, the better      we are; but if we were polished and smooth when we get the corners      knocked off, it would deface us.        Joseph Smith never professed to be a dressed, smooth, polished      stone, but to have come rough out of the mountain; and he has      been rolling among the rocks and trees, yet it has not hurt him      at all: but he will be as smooth and polished in the end as any      other stone, while many who were so very polished and smooth in      the beginning get badly defaced and spoiled while they are rolling      about.        Elder Parley P. Pratt said--Some are going to Zion, and the rest      {22} want to know what they shall do. The Lord, through Jeremiah      (III, 14,15) says, \"I will take you one of a city, and two of a      family, and I will bring you to Zion; and I will give you pastors      according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and      understanding.\" Inasmuch as you hearken to counsel, you will know      what the will of the Lord is concerning you in all things. Meet      often together to worship God and to speak to each other of the      things of God. Gather as soon as you can. Come up to the mountain      of the Lord's house, and there learn of these things, that the      Scriptures may be fulfilled.        Elder Orson Pratt said--I do not know that I can say anything to      impress the subjects which have been spoken upon more fully upon      your minds than has been done. There are some things, however, I      wish to mention. We have learned from what we have heard this day      that great blessings will be given to the faithful when the Temple      is finished. I will speak of some of the consequences that will      follow, if we do not obey.        When the Temple is reared, God will manifest Himself in a peculiar      manner. If we are obedient, He has told us He will make manifest      to us things we are ignorant of. He has said He will reveal things      which pertain to this dispensation that have been hidden and kept      secret from the foundation of the world.        No former age or generation of the world have had the same things      revealed: all other dispensations will be swallowed up in this. He      declares, in His revelations, the consequences of not building the      house unto His name within such a time. The Lord says, If you build      the house in that time, you shall be blessed; but if not, you shall      be rejected as a church with your dead, saith the Lord. So, if that      house is not built, then in vain are all our cares; our faith and      works, our meetings and hopes are vain also; our performances and      acts will be void.        The servants of God who are faithful and do their duty will get      the blessing; and we are determined to do our duty, and lay these      principles before the Saints, so that they may have the privilege      of contributing. We will turn this responsibility upon the heads of      the Saints; then our garments will be clear, and the Lord is able      and will be willing to endow all the faithful in some other place.        This Church, in its infancy, was directed to do a certain work, and      the consequences pointed out. The Lord gave a revelation several      years since to the Church to appoint our wise men, and send up      our moneys by them to buy land; if not, we should not have an      inheritance, but our enemies should be upon us. We went through      and told the Saints these things; but did the churches do as God      commanded? No, they did not. But the revelation was fulfilled, and      the enemies of the Saints came upon them, and drove them from their      houses and homes, {23} and finally from the State of Missouri. This was      in consequence of their disobeying the commandments of God through      His servant Joseph.        Many suppose they must get direct revelation from God for      themselves. Not so. He has a prophet, and he says the Church shall      give heed to the words of the Prophet, as he is to hold the keys of      the kingdom of God in this life and in the world to come. Then it      is of much consequence that you give heed to his word.        Says one, Suppose we are not satisfied that this is the work of      God? You can ask God if the work is true, and He will give you a      testimony. You can put every confidence in the Book of Mormon and      in Joseph, the Prophet; and if you are not satisfied, go to God. I      doubt in my own mind if men can stand what they will have to pass      through, unless they do get a witness for themselves; and I pray      you to give heed to the words which the Twelve have taught you, and      ask God to help you.        The conference was adjourned until ten o'clock tomorrow morning.        _Sunday,_ 10th. Conference met according to adjournment.        Meeting was opened by singing, and prayer by Elder Maginn; after      which Elder Wilford Woodruff addressed the assembly from Amos      III:7--\"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his      secret unto his servants the prophets?\" According to the testimony      of the Scriptures in all ages of the world, whenever God was about      to bring a judgment upon the world or accomplish any great work,      the first thing he did was to raise up a Prophet, and reveal unto      him the secret, and send him to warn the people, so that they may      be left without excuse. This was the case in the days of Noah and      Lot. God was about to bring judgments upon the people, and he      raised up those Prophets who warned the people of it; yet they gave      no heed to them, but rejected their testimony; and the judgments      came upon the people, so that they were destroyed, while the      Prophets were saved by pursuing the course marked out by the Lord.        Jesus Christ testified to the Jews of the things that awaited them      as a nation, the fall of Jerusalem, and their dispersion among      the Gentile world; but they did not believe it. Yet the secret of      all these things was revealed to the Prophets and Apostles. They      believed it, and looked for its fulfillment; and it came to pass as      it was predicted, though contrary to the expectation of the Jewish      nation.        In like manner do we look for the certain fulfillment of those      tremendous events upon the heads of the Gentile world which have      been spoken of and pointed out by all the holy Prophets and      Apostles since the world began, they having spoken as they were      moved upon by the power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost,      events which more deeply {24} concern the Gentile world than the      overthrow of Jerusalem and the "]]]
