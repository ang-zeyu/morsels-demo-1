The reply was in the affirmative. The freed servants had retired when  Hiram left them. The officials would not break up for some time yet, but  there was less difficulty in passing them.    \"Very good,\" said the girl. \"Then you, Hiram, lead the way and wait for  me by the little side door. I will give you something in my room  which will pay the Nabathaean's charges ten times over. Do not look so  horrified, Betta. I will give him the large emerald out of my mother's  necklace.\" The woman clasped her hands, and cried out in dismay and  warning.    \"Child, child! That splendid gem! an heirloom in the family--that stone  which came to you from the saintly Emperor Theodosius--to sell that of  all things! Nay-to throw it away; not to rescue your father either,  but merely--yes child, for that is the truth, merely because you lack  patience to wait two little weeks!\"    \"That is hard, that is unjust, Betta,\" Paula broke in reprovingly. \"It  will be a question of a month, and we all know how much depends on  the messenger. Do you forget how highly Hiram spoke of this very man's  intelligence? And besides--must I, the younger, remind you?--What is the  life of man? An instant may decide his life or death; and my father is  an old man, scarred from many wounds even before the siege. It may make  just the difference between our meeting, or never meeting again.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said the old woman in subdued tones, \"perhaps you are right,  and if I...\" But Paula stopped her mouth with a kiss, and then desired  Hiram to carry the gem, the first thing in the morning, to Gamaliel the  Jew, a wealthy and honest man, and not to sell it for less than twelve  thousand drachmae. If the goldsmith could not pay so much for it at  once, he might be satisfied to bring away the two thousand drachmae for  the messenger, and fetch the remainder at another season.    The Syrian led the way, and when, after a long leave-taking, she quitted  her nurse's pleasant little room, Hiram had done her bidding and was  waiting for her at the little side door.          CHAPTER VIII.    As Hiram had supposed, the better class of the household were still  sitting with their friends, and they had been joined by the guide and  by the Arab merchant's head man: Rustem the Masdakite, as well as his  secretary and interpreter.    With the exception only of Gamaliel the Jewish goldsmith, and the Arab's  followers, the whole of the party were Christians; and it had gone  against the grain to admit the Moslems into their circle--the Jew had  for years been a welcome member of the society. However, they had done  so, and not without marked civility; for their lord had desired that  the strangers should be made welcome, and they might expect to hear much  that was new from wanderers from such a distance. In this, to be sure,  they were disappointed, for the dragoman was taciturn and the Masdakite  could speak no Egyptian, and Greek very ill. So, after various futile  attempts to make the new-comers talk, they paid no further heed to them,  and Orion's secretary became the chief speaker. He had already told them  yesterday much that was fresh and interesting about the Imperial court;  to-day he entered into fuller details of the brilliant life his young  lord had led at Constantinople, whither he had accompanied him. He  described the three races he had won in the Circus with his own horses;  gave a lively picture of his forcing his way with only five followers  through a raging mob of rioters, from the palace to the church of St.  Sophia; and then enlarged on Orion's successes among the beauties of the  Capital.    \"The queen of them all,\" he went on in boastful accents, \"was  Heliodora--no flute-player nor anything of that kind; no indeed, but  a rich, elegant, and virtuous patrician lady, the widow of Flavianus,  nephew to Justinus the senator, and a relation of the Emperor. All  Constantinople was at her feet, the great Gratian himself sought to win  her, but of course, in vain. There is no palace to compare with hers in  all Egypt, not even in Alexandria. The governor's residence here--for  I think nothing of mere size--is a peasant's hut--a wretched barn by  comparison! I will tell you another time what that casket of treasures  is like. Its door was besieged day and night by slaves and freedmen  bringing her offerings of flowers and fruit, rare gifts, and tender  verses written on perfumed, rose-colored silk; but her favors were not  to be purchased till she met Orion. Would you believe it: from the first  time she saw him in Justinus' villa she fell desperately in love with  him; it was all over with her; she was his as completely as the ring on  my finger is mine!\"    And in his vanity he showed his hearers a gold ring, with a gem of some  value, which he owed to the liberality of his young master. \"From that  day forth,\" he eagerly went on, \"the names of Orion and Heliodora were  in every mouth, and how often have I seen men quite beside themselves  over the beauty of this divine pair. In the Circus, in the theatre, or  sailing about the Bosphorus--they were to be seen everywhere together;  and through the hideous, bloody struggle for the throne they lived in a  Paradise of their own. He often took her out in his chariot; or she took  him in hers.\"    \"Such a woman has horses too?\" asked the head groom contemptuously.    \"A woman!\" cried the secretary. \"A lady of rank!--She has none but  bright chestnuts; large horses of Armenian breed, and small, swift  beasts from the island of Sardinia, which fly on with the chariot, four  abreast, like hunted foxes. Her horses are always decked with flowers  and ribbons fluttering from the gold harness, and the grooms know how  to drive them too!--Well, every one thought that our young lord and the  handsome widow would marry; and it was a terrible blow to the hapless  Heliodora when nothing came of it--she looks like a saint and is as soft  as a kitten. I was by when they parted, and she shed such bitter tears  it was pitiable to see. Still, she could not be angry with her idol,  poor, gentle, tender kitten. She even gave him her lap-dog for a  keepsake--that little silky thing you have seen here. And take my word  for it, that was a true love-token, for her heart was as much set on  that little beast as if it had been her favorite child. And he felt the  parting too, felt it deeply; however, I am his confidential secretary,  and it would never do for me to tell tales out of school. He clasped the  little dog to his heart as he bid her farewell, and he promised her to  send some keepsake in return which should show her how precious her love  had been--and it will be no trifle, that any one may swear who knows  my master. You, Gamaliel, I daresay he has been to you about it by this  time.\"    The man thus addressed--the same to whom Hiram was to offer Paula's  emerald--was a rich Alexandrian of a happy turn of mind; as soon as the  incursion of the Saracens had made Alexandria an unsafe residence, so  that the majority of his fellow Israelites had fled from the great port,  he had found his way to Memphis, where he could count on the protection  of his patron, the Mukaukas George.    He shook his grizzled curls at this question, but he presently whispered  in the secretary's ear. \"We have the very thing he wants. You bring me  the cow and you shall have a calf--and a calf with twelve legs too. Is  it a bargain?\"    \"Twelve per cent on the profits? Done!\" replied the secretary in the  same tone, with a sly smile of intelligence.    When, by-and-bye, an accountant asked him why Orion had not brought home  this fair dame, the bearer too of a noble name, to his parents as their  daughter-in-law, he replied that, being a Greek, she was of course a  Melchite. Those present asked no better reason; as soon as the question  of creed was raised the conversation, as usual in these convivial  evenings, became a squabble over dogmatic differences; in the course of  it a legal official ventured to opine that if the case had been that of  a less personage than a son of the Mukaukas--for whom it was, of  course, out of the question--of a mere Jacobite citizen and his Melchite  sweetheart, for instance, some compromise might have been effected. They  need only have made up their minds each, respectively, to subscribe to  the Monothelitic doctrine--though, he, for his part, could have nothing  to say to anything of the kind; it was warmly upheld by the Imperial  court, and by Cyrus, the deceased patriarch of Alexandria, and was based  on the assumption that there were indeed two natures in Christ, but both  under the control of one and the same will. By this dogma there were  in the Saviour two persons no doubt; still it asserted His unity in a  certain qualified sense, and this was the most important point.    Such an heretical proposition was of course loudly disapproved of by the  assembled Jacobites; differences of opinion were more and more strongly  asserted, and a calm interchange of views turned to a riotous quarrel  which threatened to end in actual violence.    This discussion was already beginning when Paula succeeded in slipping  unseen across the court-yard.    She silently beckoned to Hiram to follow her; he cautiously took off  his shoes, pushed them under the steep servants' stairs, and in a few  minutes was standing in the young girl's room. Paula at once opened a  chest, and took out a costly and beautifully-wrought necklace set with  pearls. This she handed to the Syrian, desiring him to wrench from  its setting a large emerald which hung from the middle. The freedman's  strong hand, with the aid of a knife, quickly and easily did the work;  and he stood weighing the gem, as it lay freed from the gold hemisphere  that had held it, larger than a walnut, shining and sparkling on his  palm, while Paula repeated the instructions "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/560"],[0,"Mr. Standfast (#16)"],[1,"rail, and it gave with me, so that for  an instant I was more than half overboard. But my fingers clawed wildly  and caught in the links of what must have been the anchor chain. They  held, though a ton's weight seemed to be tugging at my feet ... Then  the old tub rolled back, the waters slipped off, and I was sprawling on  a wet deck with no breath in me and a gallon of brine in my windpipe.    I heard a voice cry out sharply, and a hand helped me to my feet. It  was Gresson, and he seemed excited.    'God, Mr Brand, that was a close call! I was coming up to find you,  when this damned ship took to lying on her side. I guess I must have  cannoned into you, and I was calling myself bad names when I saw you  rolling into the Atlantic. If I hadn't got a grip on the rope I would  have been down beside you. Say, you're not hurt? I reckon you'd better  come below and get a glass of rum under your belt. You're about as wet  as mother's dish-clouts.'    There's one advantage about campaigning. You take your luck when it  comes and don't worry about what might have been. I didn't think any  more of the business, except that it had cured me of wanting to be  sea-sick. I went down to the reeking cabin without one qualm in my  stomach, and ate a good meal of welsh-rabbit and bottled Bass, with a  tot of rum to follow up with. Then I shed my wet garments, and slept in  my bunk till we anchored off a village in Mull in a clear blue morning.    It took us four days to crawl up that coast and make Oban, for we  seemed to be a floating general store for every hamlet in those parts.  Gresson made himself very pleasant, as if he wanted to atone for nearly  doing me in. We played some poker, and I read the little books I had  got in Colonsay, and then rigged up a fishing-line, and caught saithe  and lythe and an occasional big haddock. But I found the time pass  slowly, and I was glad that about noon one day we came into a bay  blocked with islands and saw a clean little town sitting on the hills  and the smoke of a railway engine.    I went ashore and purchased a better brand of hat in a tweed store.  Then I made a bee-line for the post office, and asked for telegrams.  One was given to me, and as I opened it I saw Gresson at my elbow.    It read thus:       _Brand, Post office, Oban. Page 117, paragraph 3. Ochterlony._    I passed it to Gresson with a rueful face.    'There's a piece of foolishness,' I said. 'I've got a cousin who's a  Presbyterian minister up in Ross-shire, and before I knew about this  passport humbug I wrote to him and offered to pay him a visit. I told  him to wire me here if it was convenient, and the old idiot has sent me  the wrong telegram. This was likely as not meant for some other brother  parson, who's got my message instead.'    'What's the guy's name?' Gresson asked curiously, peering at the  signature.    'Ochterlony. David Ochterlony. He's a great swell at writing books, but  he's no earthly use at handling the telegraph. However, it don't  signify, seeing I'm not going near him.' I crumpled up the pink form  and tossed it on the floor. Gresson and I walked to the _Tobermory_  together.    That afternoon, when I got a chance, I had out my _Pilgrim's Progress_.  Page 117, paragraph 3, read:       '_Then I saw in my dream, that a little off the road, over     against the Silver-mine, stood Demas (gentlemanlike) to call to     passengers to come and see: who said to Christian and his     fellow, Ho, turn aside hither and I will show you a thing._    At tea I led the talk to my own past life. I yarned about my  experiences as a mining engineer, and said I could never get out of the  trick of looking at country with the eye of the prospector. 'For  instance,' I said, 'if this had been Rhodesia, I would have said there  was a good chance of copper in these little kopjes above the town.  They're not unlike the hills round the Messina mine.' I told the  captain that after the war I was thinking of turning my attention to  the West Highlands and looking out for minerals.    'Ye'll make nothing of it,' said the captain. 'The costs are ower big,  even if ye found the minerals, for ye'd have to import a' your labour.  The West Hielandman is no fond o' hard work. Ye ken the psalm o' the  crofter?       _O that the peats would cut themselves,     The fish chump on the shore,     And that I in my bed might lie     Henceforth for ever more!_'    'Has it ever been tried?' I asked.    'Often. There's marble and slate quarries, and there was word o' coal  in Benbecula. And there's the iron mines at Ranna.'    'Where's that?' I asked.    'Up forenent Skye. We call in there, and generally bide a bit. There's  a heap of cargo for Ranna, and we usually get a good load back. But as  I tell ye, there's few Hielanders working there. Mostly Irish and lads  frae Fife and Falkirk way.'    I didn't pursue the subject, for I had found Demas's silver-mine. If  the _Tobermory_ lay at Ranna for a week, Gresson would have time to do  his own private business. Ranna would not be the spot, for the island  was bare to the world in the middle of a much-frequented channel. But  Skye was just across the way, and when I looked in my map at its big,  wandering peninsulas I concluded that my guess had been right, and that  Skye was the place to make for.    That night I sat on deck with Gresson, and in a wonderful starry  silence we watched the lights die out of the houses in the town, and  talked of a thousand things. I noticed--what I had had a hint of  before--that my companion was no common man. There were moments when he  forgot himself and talked like an educated gentleman: then he would  remember, and relapse into the lingo of Leadville, Colorado. In my  character of the ingenuous inquirer I set him posers about politics and  economics, the kind of thing I might have been supposed to pick up from  unintelligent browsing among little books. Generally he answered with  some slangy catchword, but occasionally he was interested beyond his  discretion, and treated me to a harangue like an equal. I discovered  another thing, that he had a craze for poetry, and a capacious memory  for it. I forgot how we drifted into the subject, but I remember he  quoted some queer haunting stuff which he said was Swinburne, and  verses by people I had heard of from Letchford at Biggleswick. Then he  saw by my silence that he had gone too far, and fell back into the  jargon of the West. He wanted to know about my plans, and we went down  into the cabin and had a look at the map. I explained my route, up  Morvern and round the head of Lochiel, and back to Oban by the east  side of Loch Linnhe.    'Got you,' he said. 'You've a hell of a walk before you. That bug never  bit me, and I guess I'm not envying you any. And after that, Mr Brand?'    'Back to Glasgow to do some work for the cause,' I said lightly.    'Just so,' he said with a grin. 'It's a great life if you don't weaken.'    We steamed out of the bay next morning at dawn, and about nine o'clock  I got on shore at a little place called Lochaline. My kit was all on my  person, and my waterproof's pockets were stuffed with chocolates and  biscuits I had bought in Oban. The captain was discouraging. 'Ye'll get  your bellyful o' Hieland hills, Mr Brand, afore ye win round the loch  head. Ye'll be wishin' yerself back on the _Tobermory_.' But Gresson  speeded me joyfully on my way, and said he wished he were coming with  me. He even accompanied me the first hundred yards, and waved his hat  after me till I was round the turn of the road.    The first stage in that journey was pure delight. I was thankful to be  rid of the infernal boat, and the hot summer scents coming down the  glen were comforting after the cold, salt smell of the sea. The road  lay up the side of a small bay, at the top of which a big white house  stood among gardens. Presently I had left the coast and was in a glen  where a brown salmon-river swirled through acres of bog-myrtle. It had  its source in a loch, from which the mountain rose steeply--a place so  glassy in that August forenoon that every scar and wrinkle of the  hillside were faithfully reflected. After that I crossed a low pass to  the head of another sea-lock, and, following the map, struck over the  shoulder of a great hill and ate my luncheon far up on its side, with a  wonderful vista of wood and water below me.    All that morning I was very happy, not thinking about Gresson or Ivery,  but getting my mind clear in those wide spaces, and my lungs filled  with the brisk hill air. But I noticed one curious thing. On my last  visit to Scotland, when I covered more moorland miles a day than any  man since Claverhouse, I had been fascinated by the land, and had  pleased myself with plans for settling down in it. But now, after three  years of war and general rocketing, I felt less drawn to that kind of  landscape. I wanted something more green and peaceful and habitable,  and it was to the Cotswolds that my memory turned with longing.    I puzzled over this till I realized that in all my Cotswold pictures a  figure kept going and coming--a young girl with a cloud of gold hair  and the strong, slim grace of a boy, who had sung 'Cherry Ripe' in a  moonlit garden. Up on that hillside I understood very clearly that I,  who had been as careless of women as any monk, had fallen wildly in  love with a child of half my age. I was loath to admit it, though for  weeks the conclusion had been forcing itself on me. Not that I didn't  revel in my madness, but that it seemed too hopeless a business, and I  had no use for barren philandering. But, seated on a rock munching  chocolate and biscuits, I faced up to the fact and resolved to trust my  luck. After all we were comrades in a big job, and it was up to me to  be man enough to win her. The thought seemed to brace any courage that  was in me. No task seemed too hard with her approval to gain and her  companionship somewhere"]]]
