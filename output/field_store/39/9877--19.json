I was heading, footing rather, for Meredith Bridge in New Hampshire.  It was in the month of December; and I was poorly clad and without an  overcoat. I must have walked fifteen miles that afternoon, and just at  nightfall I came to a wayside public house and ventured to go in. As  I stood by the fire, the landlord stepped up and slapping me on the  shoulder, said:    \"Friend, you look as if you were in trouble; step up and have something  to drink.\"    I gladly accepted the invitation to partake of the first glass of liquor  I had tasted in three years. It was something, too, everything to be  addressed thus kindly. I told this worthy landlord my whole story; how  I had been trapped by the two milliners, and how I had subsequently  suffered. He had read something about it in the papers; he felt as if  he knew me; he certainly was sorry for me; and he proved his sympathy  by giving me what then seemed to me the best supper I had ever eaten,  a good bed, a good breakfast, a package of provisions to carry with me,  and then sent me on my way with a comparatively light heart.    It rained, snowed, and drizzled all day long. I tramped through the wet  snow ankle deep, but made nearly forty miles before night, and then came  to a public house which I knew well. When I was in the bar-room drying  myself and warming my wet and half-frozen feet, I could not but think  how, only a few years before, I had put up at that very house, with a  fine horse and buggy of my own in the stable, and plenty of money in my  pocket. The landlord's face was familiar enough, but he did not know  me, nor, under my changed circumstances, did I desire that he should.  Supper, lodging, and breakfast nearly exhausted my small money capital;  I was worn and weary, too, and the next day was able to walk but twenty  miles, all told. On the way, at noon I went into a farm house to warm  myself. The woman had just baked a short-cake which stood on the  hearth, toward which I must have cast longing eyes, for the farmer said:    \"Have you had your dinner, man?\"    \"No, and I have no money to buy any.\"    \"Well, you don't need money here. Wife, put that short-cake and some  butter on the table; now, my man, fall to and eat as much as you like.\"    I was very hungry, and I declare I ate the whole of that short-cake.  I told these people that I had been in better circumstances, and that  I was not always the poor, ragged, hungry wretch I appeared then. They  made we welcome to what I had eaten and when I went away filled my  pockets with food. At night I was about thirty miles above Concord. I  had no money, but trusting to luck, I got on the cars--the conductor  came, and when he found I had no ticket, he said he must put me off. It  was a bitter night and I told him I should be sure to freeze to death.  A gentleman who heard the conversation at once paid my fare, for which I  expressed my grateful thanks, and I went to Concord.    On my arrival I went to a hotel and told the landlord I wanted to stay  there till the next day, when a conductor whom I knew would be going to  Meredith Bridge; that I was going with him, and that he would probably  pay my bill at the hotel. \"All right,\" said the landlord, and he gave me  my supper and a room. The next noon my friend, the conductor, came and  when I first spoke to him he did not recognize me; I told him who I  was, but to ask me no questions as to how I came to appear in those old  clothes, and to be so poor; I wanted to borrow five dollars, and to go  with him to Meredith Bridge. He greeted me very cordially, handed me a  ten-dollar Bill--twice as much as I asked for--said he was not going to  the Bridge till next day, and told me meanwhile, to go to the hotel and  make myself comfortable.    I went back to the hotel, paid my bill, stayed there that day and night,  and the next morning \"deadheaded,\" with my friend the conductor to  Meredith Bridge. Everybody knew me there. The hotel-keeper made me  welcome to his house, and said I could stay as long as I liked.    \"Say, dew ye ever cure anybody, Doctor?\" asked my old friend, the  landlord, and he laughed and nudged me in the ribs, and asked me to take  some of his medicine from the bar, which I immediately did.    I was at home now. But the object of my visit was to see if I could  not collect some of my old bills in that neighborhood, amounting in the  aggregate to several hundred dollars. They were indeed old bills of five  or six years' standing, and I had very little hope of collecting much  money. I went first to Lake Village, and called on Mr. John Blaisdell,  the husband of the woman whom I had cured of the dropsy, in accordance,  as she believed at the time, with her prophetic dream. Blaisdell didn't  know me at first; then he wanted to know what my bill was; I told him  one hundred dollars, to say nothing of six years' interest; he said he  had no money, though he was regarded as a rich man, and in fact was.    \"But sir,\" said I, \"you see me and how poor I am. Give me something on  account. I am so poor that I even borrowed this overcoat from the  tailor in the village, that I might present a little more respectable  appearance when I called on my old patients to try to collect some of my  old bills. Please to give me something.\"    But he had no money. He would pay for the overcoat; I might tell the  tailor so; and afterwards he gave me a pair of boots and an old shirt.  This was the fruit which my \"blossom\" of years before brought at last.  I saw Mrs. Blaisdell, but she said she could do nothing for me. She had  forgotten what I had done for her.    Of all my bills in that vicinity, with a week's dunning, I collected  only three dollars; but a good friend of mine, Sheriff Hill, went around  and succeeded in making up a purse of twenty dollars which he put into  my hands just as I was going away. My old landlord wanted nothing for my  week's board; all he wanted was to know \"if I ever cured anybody;\" and  when I told him I did, \"sometimes\" he insisted upon my taking more of  his medicine, and he put up a good bottle of it for me to carry with me  on my journey.    With my twenty dollars I went to Portsmouth, where I speedily felt that  I was among old and true friends. I had not been there a day before I  was called upon to take care of a young man who was sick, and after a  few weeks charge of him I received in addition to my board and expenses,  three hundred dollars. I was now enabled to clothe myself handsomely,  and I did so and went to Newburyport, where I remained several weeks and  made a great deal of money.    In the spring I went to White River Junction, and while I was in  the hotel taking a drink with some friends, who should come into the  bar-room but the Lake Village tailor from whom I had borrowed the  overcoat which I had even then on my back. I was about to thank him for  his kindness to me when he took me aside and said reproachfully:    \"Doctor, you wore away my overcoat and this is it, I think.\"    \"Good heavens! didn't John Blaisdell pay you for the coat? He told me he  would; its little enough out of what he owes me.\"    \"He never said a word to me about it,\" was the reply. I told the tailor  the circumstances; I did not like to let him to know that I had then  about seven hundred dollars in my pocket; I wished to appear poor  as long as there was a chance to collect any of my Meredith and Lake  Village bills; so I offered him three dollars to take back the coat. He  willingly consented and that was the last of the \"Blossom\" business with  the Blaisdells.    I was bound not to leave this part of the country without revisiting  Windsor, and I went there, stopping at the best house in the town, and,  I fear, \"putting on airs\" a little. I had suffered so much in this  place that I wanted to see if there was any enjoyment to be had there.  Satisfaction there was, certainly--the satisfaction one feels in going  back under the most favorable circumstances, to a spot where he has  endured the very depths of misery. After a good dinner I set out to  visit the prison. Here was the very spot in the street where, only a few  months before, I, a ragged beggar, had divided my mere morsel of money  with the poor woman from Rutland. What change in my circumstances those  few months had wrought. I had recovered my health which bad food, ill  usage, and imprisonment had broken down, and was in the best physical  condition. The warden's old coat and pantaloons had been exchanged for  the finest clothes that money would buy. I had a good gold watch and  several hundred dollars in my pocket. I had seen many of my old friends,  and knew that they were still my friends, and I was fully restored to  my old position. My three years' imprisonment was only a blank in my  existence; I had begun life again and afresh, precisely where I left off  before I fell into the hands of the two Vermont milliners.    All this was very pleasant to reflect upon; but do not believe I thought  even then, that the reason for this change in my circumstances, and  changes for the better, was simply because I had minded my business and  had let women alone.    When I called on Warden Harlow, and courteously asked to be shown about  the prison, he got up and was ready to comply with my request, when he  looked me full in the face and started back in amazement:    \"Well, I declare! Is this you?\"    \"Yes, Warden Harlow; but I want you to understand that while I am here  I do not intend to do a bit of work, and you can't make me. You may as  well give it up first as last; I won't work anyhow.\"    The Warden laughed heartily, and sent for Deputy Morey who came in to  \"see a gentleman,\" and was much astonished to find the prisoner, who,  two years before, had saved his life from the hands and knife of the  madman Hall.

Not only did they stick  bravely to their task of supplying a wonderful mail service to the  country, but they even improved their service, increasing it from a  weekly to a semi-weekly route, immediately after the disastrous raids of  June, 1860. Nor did they hesitate at the instigation of the Government a  little later to reduce their postal rates from five dollars to one  dollar a half ounce.    This condensed statement shows the approximate deficit which the  business incurred:      To equip the line .....................................$100,000    Maintenance at $30,000 per month (for sixteen months)..$480,000    War with the Utes and allied tribes ................... $75,000    Sundry items .......................................... $45,000                                                           --------    Total .................................................$700,000    The receipts are said to have been about $500,000 leaving a debit  balance of $200,000. That the Company changed hands in 1861 is not  surprising.    While the Pony Express failed in a financial way; it had served the  country faithfully and well. It had aided an imperiled Government,  helped to tranquilize and retain to the Union a giant commonwealth, and  it had shown the practicability of building a transcontinental railroad,  and keeping it open for traffic regardless of winter snows. All this  Pony Express did and more. It marked the supreme triumph of American  spirit, of God-fearing, man-defying American pluck and  determination--qualities which have always characterized the winning  of the West.
