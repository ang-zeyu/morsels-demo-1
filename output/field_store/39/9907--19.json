Happy the man or the nation who can truthfully reply to the Just and  Righteous One in that day: Lord, I rendered unto thy servants the same  respect and obedience that I would have shown unto thee, hadst thou  been present in person.    Warning and Exhortation.--The Savior's solemn warning to the world may  well be supplemented by his servant Joseph's impressive exhortation  to the Priesthood and the Church in general. He was addressing the  apostles and some of the seventies, prior to their mission to Europe,  in the summer of 1839:    \"O ye Twelve! and all Saints! profit by this important key--that in all  your trials, troubles, temptations, afflictions, bonds, imprisonments  and death, see to it, that you do not betray Heaven; that you do not  betray Jesus Christ; that you do not betray the brethren; that you  do not betray the revelations of God, whether in the Bible, Book of  Mormon, or Doctrine and Covenants, or any other that ever was or ever  will be given and revealed unto man in this world or that which is  to come. Yea, in all your kicking and flounderings, see to it that  you do not this thing, lest innocent blood be found upon your skirts,  and you go down to hell. All other sins are not to be compared to  sinning against the Holy Ghost, and proving a traitor to the brethren.\"  (\"History of the Church,\" Vol. III, p. 385.)    Such warnings give added weight to an ancient admonition that comes  sounding through the centuries: \"Touch not mine anointed; do my  prophets no harm.\"    Agents of the Almighty.--What it means to bear the Priesthood and to  officiate therein, is made clear to the comprehension by considering  men clothed upon with divine authority as agents of God, sent forth to  transact business in his name and in his interest. What kind of men  ought they to be, and what is required of them by Him who sent them  forth? Such a question can have but one consistent answer: They should  be men who will represent him truly and faithfully. They should reflect  his intelligence, his goodness, his benevolence, and as diligent,  upright agents of the One who commissioned and empowered them to carry  on his work, follow closely the instructions that he has given, doing  conscientiously and thoroughly what they sincerely believe he would do  were he present in his own proper person. Such men should live so near  to the Lord, that when the letter--the revealed word--falls short, the  Spirit that inspired it, resting upon them as a continual benediction,  can readily give \"line upon line\" of revelation, flash upon flash of  inspiration, to illumine and make plain the path they are to tread.  This is what it means to be an agent of the Almighty, a representative  of God.    \"And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost,  shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind  of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the  Lord, and the power of God unto salvation.\" (D. and C. 68:4.)        CHAPTER II.    Divine Authority, Continued.    A Twofold Power.--In an article on Priesthood, prepared by the Prophet  Joseph Smith, and read at a conference of the Church in Nauvoo,  Illinois, October, 1840, the following sentences occur:    \"There are two Priesthoods spoken of in the scripture, viz., the  Melchizedek and the Aaronic or Levitical. Although there are two  Priesthoods, yet the Melchizedek Priesthood comprehends the Aaronic  or Levitical Priesthood, and is the grand head, and holds the highest  authority which pertains to the Priesthood, and the keys of the  kingdom of God, in all ages of the world to the latest posterity on  the earth, and is the channel through which all knowledge, doctrine,  the plan of salvation, and every important matter is revealed from  heaven.\"--(\"History of the Church,\" Vol. IV, p. 207.)    Spiritual and Temporal.--Why there are two priesthoods, or, more  properly speaking, two grand divisions of the Priesthood, is because  the Church of Christ has to do with temporal as well as with spiritual  things. All things, however, are spiritual unto God. The laws and  commandments that emanate from him are of that character. He gives no  temporal commandment. All his laws are spiritual. As eternity includes  time, so the spiritual includes the temporal.    A Divided Jurisdiction.--The Melchizedek Priesthood has general  authority and jurisdiction over all things, spiritual and temporal:  while the Aaronic or lesser Priesthood, which is an appendage to the  higher power, has a limited jurisdiction, its special calling being to  administer in temporal things.    \"The Melchizedek Priesthood holds the right of presidency, and has  power and authority over all the offices in the church in all ages of  the world, to administer in spiritual things.    \"The second priesthood is called the priesthood of Aaron, because it  was conferred upon Aaron and his seed, throughout all their generations.    \"Why it is called the lesser priesthood, is because it is an appendage  to the greater or the Melchizedek Priesthood, and has power in  administering outward ordinances.    \"The power and authority of the Higher or Melchizedek Priest hood, is  to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church. * * *    \"The power and authority of the Lesser, or Aaronic Priesthood, is  to hold the keys of the ministering of angels, and to administer  in outward ordinances, the letter of the gospel--the baptism of  repentance for the remission of sins, agreeable to the covenants and  commandments.\"--(D. and C. 107:8, 13, 14, 18-20.)    The Government of God.--The Government of God, with its two great  wings of authority, corresponds to the duality of the soul: and the  saving of souls, here and hereafter, is the grand purpose for which  this government, the Church of Christ, was organized. The necessity  for a church,--which some people question, just as some question the  necessity for a civil government, or a government of any sort,--ought  to be apparent at a glance. It is as plain as that twice two make four.  Two men, united, are more capable than one man, the powers possessed  by them being equal. Individuals, working separately, however good  their intentions, can never accomplish as much as a community of men  and women, imbued with a common purpose, and pushing forward the  same enterprise. The difference between a single shot and a whole  volley, between one rifleman and a regiment, may serve as a sufficient  illustration.    The Priesthood and the Soul.--As the spirit and the body constitute  the soul, so the Melchizedek and Aaronic priesthoods constitute the  government of the Church. As through the medium of the mortal body,  with its various members and organs, the tangible things of this life  are grasped and utilized, while things pertaining to a higher state of  existence are perceived, comprehended, and made practical, by means  of the spiritual faculties; so, by this twain of powers, differing in  their prerogatives, yet allied, interwoven, and harmonious in their  mutual workings, is carried on, in this world and in all worlds,  the great cause of truth and righteousness, for the salvation and  never-ending progress of God's children.    Furthermore, to continue the analogy, it is the spirit, or higher part  of man, that controls, directs, and supplies the motive power for the  body, being the vital mainspring of that wondrous piece of machinery,  whose functions are forwarded by the animation resulting from union and  normal operation. Even so is it the Melchizedek Priesthood, holding the  right of presidency, which controls, influences, and directs the entire  body of the Church, delegating, however, a portion of its authority  to the Lesser Priesthood, that it likewise may possess and wield its  legitimate powers, and execute fully the purposes for which it was  designed.    The Channel of Revelation.--Speaking of the eternity of the Priesthood,  the Prophet Joseph says:    \"Its institution was prior to the foundation of this earth, or the  morning stars sang together, or the Sons of God shouted for joy,' and  is the highest and holiest Priesthood, and is after the order of the  Son of God, and all other priesthoods are only parts, ramifications,  powers and blessings belonging to the same, and are held, controlled,  and directed by it. It is the channel through which the Almighty  commenced revealing his glory at the beginning of the creation of this  earth, and through which he has continued to reveal himself to the  children of men to the present time, and through which he will make  known his purposes to the end of time.\"--(\"History of the Church,\" Vol.  IV, p. 207.)    Adam's Position.--In another place, the Prophet thus continues:    \"The Priesthood was first given to Adam; he obtained the First  Presidency, and held the keys of it from generation to generation. He  obtained it in the creation, before the world was formed [that is,  in the spiritual creation, before the temporal world was formed]. He  had dominion given him over every living creature. He is Michael the  Archangel, spoken of in the scriptures.\"--(\"History of the Church,\"  Vol. III, pp. 385, 386.)    Noah Next to Adam.--\"Then to Noah, who is Gabriel; he stands next in  authority to Adam in the Priesthood; he was called of God to this  office, and was the father of all living in his day, and to him was  given the dominion. These men held keys first on earth, and then in  heaven.\"--(Ibid, p. 386.)    An Everlasting Principle.--\"The Priesthood is an everlasting principle,  and existed with God from eternity, and will to eternity, without  beginning of days or end of years. The keys have to be brought from  heaven whenever the gospel is sent. When they are revealed from heaven,  it is by Adam's authority.    * * * * * * * * * * *    Succession and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5061"],[0,"The Children's Book of Christmas Stories (#16)"],[1,"singing through the trees.    But the fact was that no one had heard them for years and years. There  was an old man living not far from the church who said that his mother  had spoken of hearing them when she was a little girl, and he was the  only one who was sure of as much as that. They were Christmas chimes,  you see, and were not meant to be played by men or on common days.  It was the custom on Christmas Eve for all the people to bring to the  church their offerings to the Christ-Child; and when the greatest and  best offering was laid on the altar there used to come sounding through  the music of the choir the Christmas chimes far up in the tower. Some  said that the wind rang them, and others, that they were so high that  the angels could set them swinging. But for many long years they had  never been heard. It was said that people had been growing less careful  of their gifts for the Christ-Child, and that no offering was brought  great enough to deserve the music of the chimes.    Every Christmas Eve the rich people still crowded to the altar, each one  trying to bring some better gift than any other, without giving anything  that he wanted for himself, and the church was crowded with those who  thought that perhaps the wonderful bells might be heard again. But  although the service was splendid, and the offerings plenty, only the  roar of the wind could be heard, far up in the stone tower.    Now, a number of miles from the city, in a little country village, where  nothing could be seen of the great church but glimpses of the tower when  the weather was fine, lived a boy named Pedro, and his little brother.  They knew very little about the Christmas chimes, but they had heard of  the service in the church on Christmas Eve, and had a secret plan  which they had often talked over when by themselves, to go to see the  beautiful celebration.    \"Nobody can guess, Little Brother,\" Pedro would say; \"all the fine  things there are to see and hear; and I have even heard it said that the  Christ-Child sometimes comes down to bless the service. What if we could  see Him?\"    The day before Christmas was bitterly cold, with a few lonely snowflakes  flying in the air, and a hard white crust on the ground. Sure enough  Pedro and Little Brother were able to slip quietly away early in the  afternoon; and although the walking was hard in the frosty air, before  nightfall they had trudged so far, hand in hand, that they saw the  lights of the big city just ahead of them. Indeed they were about to  enter one of the great gates in the wall that surrounded it, when they  saw something dark on the snow near their path, and stepped aside to  look at it.    It was a poor woman, who had fallen just outside the city, too sick and  tired to get in where she might have found shelter. The soft snow made  of a drift a sort of pillow for her, and she would soon be so sound  asleep, in the wintry air, that no one could ever waken her again. All  this Pedro saw in a moment and he knelt down beside her and tried to  rouse her, even tugging at her arm a little, as though he would have  tried to carry her away. He turned her face toward him, so that he could  rub some of the snow on it, and when he had looked at her silently a  moment he stood up again, and said:    \"It's no use, Little Brother. You will have to go on alone.\"    \"Alone?\" cried Little Brother. \"And you not see the Christmas festival?\"    \"No,\" said Pedro, and he could not keep back a bit of a choking sound in  his throat. \"See this poor woman. Her face looks like the Madonna in  the chapel window, and she will freeze to death if nobody cares for her.  Every one has gone to the church now, but when you come back you can  bring some one to help her. I will rub her to keep her from freezing,  and perhaps get her to eat the bun that is left in my pocket.\"    \"But I cannot bear to leave you, and go on alone,\" said Little Brother.    \"Both of us need not miss the service,\" said Pedro, \"and it had better  be I than you. You can easily find your way to church; and you must see  and hear everything twice, Little Brother--once for you and once for me.  I am sure the Christ-Child must know how I should love to come with you  and worship Him; and oh! if you get a chance, Little Brother, to slip up  to the altar without getting in any one's way, take this little silver  piece of mine, and lay it down for my offering, when no one is looking.  Do not forget where you have left me, and forgive me for not going with  you.\"    In this way he hurried Little Brother off to the city and winked hard  to keep back the tears, as he heard the crunching footsteps sounding  farther and farther away in the twilight. It was pretty hard to lose  the music and splendour of the Christmas celebration that he had been  planning for so long, and spend the time instead in that lonely place in  the snow.    The great church was a wonderful place that night. Every one said that  it had never looked so bright and beautiful before. When the organ  played and the thousands of people sang, the walls shook with the sound,  and little Pedro, away outside the city wall, felt the earth tremble  around them.    At the close of the service came the procession with the offerings to be  laid on the altar. Rich men and great men marched proudly up to lay down  their gifts to the Christ-Child. Some brought wonderful jewels, some  baskets of gold so heavy that they could scarcely carry them down the  aisle. A great writer laid down a book that he had been making for years  and years. And last of all walked the king of the country, hoping with  all the rest to win for himself the chime of the Christmas bells. There  went a great murmur through the church as the people saw the king take  from his head the royal crown, all set with precious stones, and lay  it gleaming on the altar, as his offering to the Holy Child. \"Surely,\"  every one said, \"we shall hear the bells now, for nothing like this has  ever happened before.\"    But still only the cold old wind was heard in the tower and the people  shook their heads; and some of them said, as they had before, that they  never really believed the story of the chimes, and doubted if they ever  rang at all.    The procession was over, and the choir began the closing hymn. Suddenly  the organist stopped playing; and every one looked at the old minister,  who was standing by the altar, holding up his hand for silence. Not a  sound could be heard from any one in the church, but as all the people  strained their ears to listen, there came softly, but distinctly,  swinging through the air, the sound of the chimes in the tower. So far  away, and yet so clear the music seemed--so much sweeter were the notes  than anything that had been heard before, rising and falling away up  there in the sky, that the people in the church sat for a moment as  still as though something held each of them by the shoulders. Then they  all stood up together and stared straight at the altar, to see what  great gift had awakened the long silent bells.    But all that the nearest of them saw was the childish figure of Little  Brother, who had crept softly down the aisle when no one was looking,  and had laid Pedro's little piece of silver on the altar.

Three cheers for  Mrs. Chickadee!\"    \"Hush!\" said Mrs. Chickadee, \"and I'll tell you all about it. To-morrow  IS Christmas Day, but I don't want to give a party.\"    \"Chee, chee, chee!\" cried Robin Rusty-breast; \"chee, chee, chee!\"    \"Just listen to my little plan,\" said Mrs. Chickadee, \"for, indeed, I  want you all to help. How many remember Thistle Goldfinch--the happy  little fellow who floated over the meadows through the summer and fall?\"    \"Cheerup, chee-chee, cheerup, chee-chee, I do,\" sang the Robin; \"how he  loved to sway on thistletops!\"    \"Yes,\" said Downy Woodpecker, \"and didn't he sing? All about blue skies,  and sunshine and happy days, with his 'Swee-e-et sweet-sweet-sweet-a-  twitter-witter-witter-witter-wee-twea!'\"    \"Ter-ra-lee, ter-ra-lee,\" said Snow Bunting. \"We've all heard of Thistle  Goldfinch, but what can he have to do with your Christmas party? He's  away down South now, and wouldn't care if you gave a dozen parties.\"    \"Oh, but he isn't; he's right in these very woods!\"    \"Why, you don't mean--\"    \"Indeed I do mean it, every single word. Yesterday I was flitting about  among the trees, peeking at a dead branch here, and a bit of moss there,  and before I knew it I found myself away over at the other side of the  woods! 'Chickadee-dee-dee, chickadee-dee-dee!' I sang, as I turned my  bill toward home. Just then I heard the saddest little voice pipe  out: 'Dear-ie me! Dear-ie me!' and there on the sunny side of a branch  perched a lonesome bit of yellowish down. I went up to see what it was,  and found dear little Thistle Goldfinch! He was very glad to see me, and  soon told his short story. Through the summer Papa and Mamma Goldfinch  and all the brothers and sisters had a fine time, singing together,  fluttering over thistletops, or floating through the balmy air. But when  'little Jack Frost walked through the trees,' Papa Goldfinch said: 'It  is high time we went South!' All were ready but Thistle; he wanted to  stay through the winter,"]]]
