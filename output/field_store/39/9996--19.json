I deny their right to force a Free State upon  an unwilling people.  I deny their right to force a good thing upon a  people who are unwilling to receive it.  The great principle is the  right of every community to judge and decide for itself, whether a thing  is right or wrong, whether it would be good or evil for them to adopt  it; and the right of free action, the right of free thought, the right  of free judgment upon the question is dearer to every true American than  any other under a free Government.  * * *  It is no answer to this  argument to say that Slavery is an evil, and hence should not be  tolerated.  You must allow the people to decide for themselves whether  it is good or evil.\"  He then adverted to the arraignment of himself by  Mr. Lincoln, and took direct issue with that gentleman on his  proposition that, as to Freedom and Slavery, \"the Union will become all  one thing or all the other;\" and maintained on the contrary, that \"it is  neither desirable nor possible that there should be uniformity in the  local institutions and domestic regulations of the different States of  this Union.\"    Upon the further proposition of Mr. Lincoln, which Mr. Douglas described  as \"a crusade against the Supreme Court of the United States on account  of the Dred Scott decision,\" and as \"an appeal from the decision\" of  that Court \"upon this high Constitutional question to a Republican  caucus sitting in the country,\" he also took \"direct and distinct issue  with him.\"  To \"the reason assigned by Mr. Lincoln for resisting the  decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case * * * because it  deprives the Negro of the privileges, immunities and rights of  citizenship which pertain, according to that decision, only to the White  man,\" Mr. Douglas also took exception thus: \"I am free to say to you  that in my opinion this Government of ours is founded on the White  basis.  It was made by the White man for the benefit of the White man,  to be administered by White men, in such manner as they should  determine.  It is also true that a Negro, an Indian, or any other man of  inferior race to a White man, should be permitted to enjoy, and humanity  requires that he should have, all the rights, privileges, and immunities  which he is capable of exercising consistent with the safety of society.  * * *  But you may ask me what are these rights and these privileges?  My answer is, that each State must decide for itself the nature and  extent of these rights. * * *  Without indorsing the wisdom of that  decision, I assert that Virginia has the same power by virtue of her  sovereignty to protect Slavery within her limits, as Illinois has to  banish it forever from our own borders.  I assert the right of each  State to decide for itself on all these questions, and I do not  subscribe to the doctrine of my friend, Mr. Lincoln, that uniformity is  either desirable or possible.  I do not acknowledge that the States must  all be Free or must all be Slave.  I do not acknowledge that the Negro  must have civil and political rights everywhere or nowhere.  * * *  I do  not acknowledge any of these doctrines of uniformity in the local and  domestic regulations in the different States.  * * *  Mr. Lincoln goes  for a warfare upon the Supreme Court of the United States because of  their judicial decision in the Dred Scott case.  I yield obedience to  the decisions in that Court--to the final determination of the highest  judicial tribunal known to our Constitution.  He objects to the Dred  Scott decision because it does not put the Negro in the possession of  the rights of citizenship on an equality with the White man.  I am  opposed to Negro equality.  * * *  I would extend to the Negro, and the  Indian, and to all dependent races every right, every privilege, and  every immunity consistent with the safety and welfare of the White  races; but equality they never should have, either political or social,  or in any other respect whatever. * * *  My friends, you see that the  issues are distinctly drawn.\"    On the following evening (July 10th) at Chicago, Mr. Lincoln addressed  another enthusiastic assemblage, in reply to Mr. Douglas; and, after  protesting against a charge that had been made the previous night by the  latter, of an \"unnatural and unholy\" alliance between Administration  Democrats and Republicans to defeat him, as being beyond his own  knowledge and belief, proceeded: \"Popular Sovereignty!  Everlasting  Popular Sovereignty!  Let us for a moment inquire into this vast matter  of Popular Sovereignty.  What is Popular Sovereignty?  We recollect at  an early period in the history of this struggle there was another name  for the same thing--Squatter Sovereignty.  It was not exactly Popular  Sovereignty, but Squatter Sovereignty.  What do those terms mean?  What  do those terms mean when used now?  And vast credit is taken by our  friend, the Judge, in regard to his support of it, when he declares the  last years of his life have been, and all the future years of his life  shall be, devoted to this matter of Popular Sovereignty.  What is it?  Why it is the Sovereignty of the People!  What was Squatter Sovereignty?  I suppose if it had any significance at all, it was the right of the  people to govern themselves, to be sovereign in their own affairs while  they were squatted down in a country not their own--while they had  squatted on a territory that did not belong to them in the sense that a  State belongs to the people who inhabit it--when it belonged to the  Nation--such right to govern themselves was called 'Squatter  Sovereignty.'    \"Now I wish you to mark.  What has become of that Squatter Sovereignty?  What has become of it?  Can you get anybody to tell you now that the  people of a Territory have any authority to govern themselves, in regard  to this mooted question of Slavery, before they form a State  Constitution?  No such thing at all, although there is a general running  fire and although there has been a hurrah made in every speech on that  side, assuming that that policy had given the people of a Territory the  right to govern themselves upon this question; yet the point is dodged.  To-day it has been decided--no more than a year ago it was decided by  the Supreme Court of the United States, and is insisted upon to-day,  that the people of a Territory have no right to exclude Slavery from a  Territory, that if any one man chooses to take Slaves into a Territory,  all the rest of the people have no right to keep them out.  This being  so, and this decision being made one of the points that the Judge  (Douglas) approved, * * *  he says he is in favor of it, and sticks to  it, and expects to win his battle on that decision, which says there is  no such thing as Squatter Sovereignty; but that any man may take Slaves  into a Territory and all the other men in the Territory may be opposed  to it, and yet by reason of the Constitution they cannot prohibit it;  when that is so, how much is left of this vast matter of Squatter  Sovereignty, I should like to know?  Again, when we get to the question  of the right of the people to form a State Constitution as they please,  to form it with Slavery or without Slavery--if that is anything new, I  confess I don't know it * * *.    \"We do not remember that, in that old Declaration of Independence,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7144"],[0,"While the Billy Boils (#16)"],[1,"and decent. I was older-looking and  more subdued like, and I'd got pretty grey in those few years that I'd  been making a fool of myself; and, some how, I felt rather glad about  it, because I reckoned she'd notice it first thing--she was always quick  at noticing things--and forgive me all the quicker. Well, I waylaid  the school kids that evening, and found out mine--a little boy and a  girl--and fine youngsters they were. The girl took after her mother, and  the youngster was the dead spit o' me. I gave 'em half a crows each and  told them to tell their mother that someone would come when the sun went  down.\"    Bogan Bill nodded approvingly.    \"So at sundown I went and knocked at the door. It opened and there stood  my little wife looking prettier than ever--only careworn.\"    Long, impressive pause.    \"Well, Jack, what did she do?\" asked Bogan.    \"She didn't do nothing.\"    \"Well, Jack, and what did she say?\"    Jack sighed and straightened himself up: \"She said--she said--'Well, so  you've come back.'\"    \"Painful silence.    \"Well, Jack, and what did you say?\"    \"I said yes.\"    \"Well, and so you had!\" said Tom Moonlight.    \"It wasn't that, Tom,\" said Jack sadly and wearily--\"_It was the way she  said it_!\"    Lally Thompson rubbed his eyes: \"And what did you do, Jack?\" he asked  gently.    \"I stayed for a year, and then I deserted her again--but meant it that  time.\"    \"Ah, well! It's time to turn in.\"          ANOTHER OF MITCHELL'S PLANS FOR THE FUTURE      \"I'll get down among the cockies along the Lachlan, or some of these  rivers,\" said Mitchell, throwing down his swag beneath a big tree. \"A  man stands a better show down there. It's a mistake to come out back. I  knocked around a good deal down there among the farms. Could always  get plenty of tucker, and a job if I wanted it. One cocky I worked  for wanted me to stay with him for good. Sorry I didn't. I'd have been  better off now. I was treated more like one of the family, and there was  a couple of good-looking daughters. One of them was clean gone on me.  There are some grand girls down that way. I always got on well with the  girls, because I could play the fiddle and sing a bit. They'll be glad  to see me when I get back there again, I know. I'll be all right--no  more bother about tucker. I'll just let things slide as soon as I spot  the house. I'll bet my boots the kettle will be boiling, and everything  in the house will be on the table before I'm there twenty minutes. And  the girls will be running to meet the old cocky when he comes riding  home at night, and they'll let down the sliprails, and ask him to guess  'who's up at our place?' Yes, I'll find a job with some old cocky, with  a good-looking daughter or two. I'll get on ploughing if I can; that's  the sort of work I like; best graft about a farm.    \"By and by the cocky'll have a few sheep he wants shorn, and one day  he'll say to me, 'Jack, if you hear of a shearer knockin' round let me  know--I've got a few sheep I want shore.'    \"'How many have you got?' I'll say.    \"'Oh, about fifteen hundred.'    \"'And what d'you think of giving?'    \"'Well, about twenty-five bob a hundred, but if a shearer sticks out for  thirty, send him up to talk with me. I want to get 'em shore as soon as  possible.'    \"'It's all right,' I'll say, 'you needn't bother; I'll shear your  sheep.'    \"'Why,' he'll say, 'can _you_ shear?'    \"'Shear? Of course I can! I shore before you were born.' It won't matter  if he's twice as old as me.    \"So I'll shear his sheep and make a few pounds, and he'll be glad and  all the more eager to keep me on, so's to always have someone to shear  his sheep. But by and by I'll get tired of stopping in the one place and  want to be on the move, so I'll tell him I'm going to leave.    \"'Why, what do you want to go for?' he'll say, surprised, 'ain't you  satisfied?'    \"'Oh, yes, I'm satisfied, but I want a change.'    \"'Oh, don't go,' he'll say; 'stop and we'll call it twenty-five bob a  week.'    \"But I'll tell him I'm off--wouldn't stay for a hundred when I'd made up  my mind; so, when he sees he can't persuade me he'll get a bit stiff and  say:    \"'Well, what about that there girl? Are you goin' to go away and leave  her like that?'    \"'Why, what d'yer mean?' I'll say. 'Leave her like what?' I won't  pretend to know what he's driving at.    \"'Oh!' he'll say, 'you know very well what I mean. The question is: _Are  you going to marry the girl or not_?'    \"I'll see that things are gettin' a little warm and that I'm in a  corner, so I'll say:    \"'Why, I never thought about it. This is pretty sudden and out of the  common, isn't it? I don't mind marrying the girl if she'll have me. Why!  I haven't asked her yet!'    \"'Well, look here,' he'll say, 'if you agree to marry the girl--and I'll  make you marry her, any road--I'll give you that there farm over there  and a couple of hundred to start on.'    \"So, I'll marry her and settle down and be a cocky myself and if you  ever happen to be knocking round there hard up, you needn't go short of  tucker a week or two; but don't come knocking round the house when I'm  not at home.\"          STEELMAN      Steelman was a hard case. If you were married, and settled down, and  were so unfortunate as to have known Steelman in other days, he would,  if in your neighbourhood and dead-beat, be sure to look you up. He would  find you anywhere, no matter what precautions you might take. If he came  to your house, he would stay to tea without invitation, and if he stayed  to tea, he would ask you to \"fix up a shake-down on the floor, old  man,\" and put him up for the night; and, if he stopped all night, he'd  remain--well, until something better turned up.    There was no shaking off Steelman. He had a way about him which would  often make it appear as if you had invited him to stay, and pressed  him against his roving inclination, and were glad to have him round for  company, while he remained only out of pure goodwill to you. He didn't  like to offend an old friend by refusing his invitation.    Steelman knew his men.    The married victim generally had neither the courage nor the ability to  turn him out. He was cheerfully blind and deaf to all hints, and if the  exasperated missus said anything to him straight, he would look shocked,  and reply, as likely as not:    \"Why, my good woman, you must be mad! I'm your husband's guest!\"    And if she wouldn't cook for him, he'd cook for himself. There was no  choking him off. Few people care to call the police in a case like this;  and besides, as before remarked, Steelman knew his men. The only way to  escape from him was to move--but then, as likely as not, he'd help pack  up and come along with his portmanteau right on top of the last load of  furniture, and drive you and your wife to the verge of madness by the  calm style in which he proceeded to superintend the hanging of your  pictures.    Once he quartered himself like this on an old schoolmate of his, named  Brown, who had got married and steady and settled down. Brown tried all  ways to get rid of Steelman, but he couldn't do it. One day Brown said  to Steelman:      \"Look here, Steely, old man, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we won't be  able to accommodate you any longer--to make you comfortable, I mean.  You see, a sister of the missus is coming down on a visit for a month or  two, and we ain't got anywhere to put her, except in your room. I wish  the missus's relations to blazes! I didn't marry the whole blessed  family; but it seems I've got to keep them.\"    Pause--very awkward and painful for poor Brown. Discouraging silence  from Steelman. Brown rested his elbows on his knees, and, with a  pathetic and appealing movement of his hand across his forehead, he  continued desperately:    \"I'm very sorry, you see, old man--you know I'd like you to stay--I want  you to stay.... It isn't my fault--it's the missus's doings. I've done my  best with her, but I can't help it. I've been more like a master in my  own house--more comfortable--and I've been better treated since I've  had you to back me up.... I'll feel mighty lonely, anyway, when ycu're  gone.... But... you know... as soon as her sister goes... you know.... \"    Here poor Brown broke down--very sorry he had spoken at all; but Steely  came to the rescue with a ray of light.    \"What's the matter with the little room at the back?\" he asked.    \"Oh, we couldn't think of putting you there,\" said Brown, with a last  effort; \"it's not fined up; you wouldn't be comfortable, and, besides,  it's damp, and you'd catch your death of cold. It was never meant for  anything but a wash-house. I'm sorry I didn't get another room built on  to the house.\"    \"Bosh!\" interrupted Steelman, cheerfully. \"Catch a cold! Here I've been  knocking about the country for the last five years--sleeping out in all  weathers--and do you think a little damp is going to hurt me? Pooh! What  do you take me for? Don't you bother your head about it any more, old  man; I'll fix up the lumber-room for myself, all right; and all you've  got to do is to let me know when the sister-in-law business is coming  on, and I'll shift out of my room in time for the missus to get it ready  for her. Here, have you got a bob on you? I'll go out and get some beer.  A drop'll do you good.\"    \"Well, if you can make yourself comfortable, I'll be only too glad for  you to stay,\" said Brown, wearily.    \"You'd better invite some woman you know to come on a visit, and pass  her off as your sister,\" said Brown to his wife, while Steelman was gone  for the beer. \"I've made a mess of it.\"    Mrs Brown said, \"I knew you would.\"    Steelman knew his men.    But at last Brown reckoned that he could stand it no longer. The thought  of it made him so wild that he couldn't work. He took a day off to  get thoroughly worked up in, came home that night full to the chin  of indignation and Dunedin beer, and tried to kick Steelman"]]]
