Presently, however, they recovered from their malady and became eager  to meet the enemy; Edmund bade his men take part in the working of the  ship in order to accustom themselves to the duties of seamen. The fleet  did not keep the sea all the time, returning often to the straits  between the Isle of Wight and the mainland, where they lay in shelter,  a look-out being kept from the top of the hills, whence a wide sweep of  sea could be seen, and where piles of wood were collected by which a  signal fire could warn the fleet to put to sea should the enemy's  vessels come in sight.    A full month passed and the Saxons began to fear that the Danes might  have eluded them, having perhaps been blown out to sea and having made  the land again far to the west. One morning, however, smoke was seen to  rise from the beacon fire. The crews who were on shore instantly  hurried on board. From the hills the Danish fleet was made out far to  the west and was seen to be approaching the land from seaward, having  been driven far out of its course by the winds.    The weather was wild and threatening and the sailors predicted a great  storm. Nevertheless the fleet put to sea and with reefed sails ran to  the west. Their vessels were larger than the Danish galleys and could  better keep the sea in a storm. Many miles were passed before, from the  decks, the Danish flotilla could be seen. Presently, however, a great  number of their galleys were discerned rowing in towards Swanage Bay.    In spite of the increasing fury of the wind the Saxons spread more sail  and succeeded in intercepting the Danes. A desperate fight began, but  the Danes in their low, long vessels had all they could do to keep  afloat on the waves. Many were run down by the Saxons. The showers of  arrows from their lofty poops confused the rowers and slew many.  Sweeping along close to them they often broke off the oars and disabled  them. Sometimes two or three of the Danish galleys would try to close  with a Saxon ship, but the sea was too rough for the boats to remain  alongside while the men tried to climb up the high sides, and the  Saxons with their spears thrust down those who strove to do so.  Confusion and terror soon reigned among the Danes, and fearing to try  to escape by sea in such a storm made for the shore, hotly pursued by  the Saxons.    But the shore was even more inhospitable than their foes. Great rocks  bordered the coast, and upon these the galleys were dashed into  fragments. The people on shore, who had gathered at the sight of the  approaching fleets, fell upon such of the Danes as succeeded in gaining  the coast, and everyone who landed was instantly slain. Thus, partly  from the effects of the Saxon fleet but still more from that of the  storm, the whole of the Danish fleet of one hundred and twenty vessels  was destroyed, not a single ship escaping the general destruction.          CHAPTER VII: THE DRAGON      The Danes at Exeter, being now cut off from all hope of relief, asked  for terms, and the king granted them their lives on condition of their  promising to leave Wessex and not to return. This promise they swore by  their most solemn oaths to observe, and marching northward passed out  of Wessex and settled near Gloucester. Some of the Saxons thought that  the king had been wrong in granting such easy terms, but he pointed out  to the ealdormen who remonstrated with him that there were many other  and larger bands of Danes in Mercia and Anglia, and that had he  massacred the band at Exeter--and this he could not have done without  the loss of many men, as assuredly the Danes would have fought  desperately for their lives--the news of their slaughter would have  brought upon him fresh invasions from all sides.    By this time all resistance to the Danes in Mercia had ceased. Again  and again King Burhred had bought them off, but this only brought fresh  hordes down upon him, and at last, finding the struggle hopeless, he  had gone as a pilgrim to Rome, where he had died. The Danes acted in  Mercia as they had done in Northumbria. They did not care, themselves,  to settle down for any length of time, and therefore appointed a weak  Saxon thane, Ceolwulf, as the King of Mercia. He ruled cruelly and  extorted large revenues from the land-owners, and robbed the  monasteries, which had escaped destruction, of their treasures.    The Danes suffered him to pursue this course until he had amassed great  wealth, when they swooped down upon him, robbed him of all he  possessed, and took away the nominal kingship he had held. As there was  now but little fresh scope for plundering in England many of the Danes  both in Anglia and Mercia settled down in the cities and on the lands  which they had taken from the Saxons.    The Danes who had gone from Exeter were now joined by another band  which had landed in South Wales. The latter, finding but small plunder  was to be obtained among the mountains of that country, moved to  Gloucester, and joining the band there proposed a fresh invasion of  Wessex. The Danes, in spite of the oaths they had sworn to Alfred, and  the hostages they had left in his hands, agreed to the proposal; and  early in the spring of 878 the bands, swollen by reinforcements from  Mercia, marched into Wiltshire and captured the royal castle of  Chippenham on the Avon. From this point they spread over the country  and destroyed everything with fire and sword. A general panic seized  the inhabitants. The better class, with the bishops, priests, and  monks, made for the sea-coasts and thence crossed to France, taking  with them all their portable goods, with the relics, precious stones,  and ornaments of the churches and monasteries.    Another party of Danes in twenty-three ships had landed in Devonshire.  Here the ealdorman Adda had constructed a castle similar to that which  Edmund had built. It was fortified by nature on three sides and had a  strong rampart of earth on another. The Danes tried to starve out the  defenders of the fort; but the Saxons held out for a long time,  although sorely pressed by want of water. At last they sallied out one  morning at daybreak and fell upon the Danes and utterly defeated them,  only a few stragglers regaining their ships.    A thousand Danes are said to have been slain at Kynwith; but this was  an isolated success; in all other parts of the kingdom panic appeared  to have taken possession of the West Saxons. Those who could not leave  the country retired to the woods, and thence, when the Danes had passed  by, leaving ruin and desolation behind them, they sallied out and again  began to till the ground as best they could. Thus for a time the West  Saxons, formerly so valiant and determined, sank to the condition of  serfs; for when all resistance ceased the Danes were well pleased to  see the ground tilled, as otherwise they would speedily have run short  of stores.    At the commencement of the invasion Edmund had marched out with his  band and had inflicted heavy blows upon parties of plunderers; but he  soon perceived that the struggle was hopeless. He therefore returned to  Sherborne, and collecting such goods as he required and a good store of  provisions he marched to the place where the ship had been hidden. No  wandering band of Danes had passed that way, and the bushes with which  she had been covered were undisturbed. These were soon removed and a  passage three feet deep, and wide enough for the ship to pass through,  was dug from the deep hole in which she was lying to the river.    When the last barrier was cut the water poured in, and the Saxons had  the satisfaction of seeing the vessel rise gradually until the water in  the dock was level with that in the river. Then she was taken out into  the stream, the stores and fittings placed aboard, and she was poled  down to the mouth of the river. Egbert had gone before and had already  engaged fifteen sturdy sailors to go with them. The Danes had not yet  reached the sea-coast from the interior, and there was therefore no  difficulty in obtaining the various equipments necessary. In a week her  masts were up and her sails in position.    The Dragon, as she was called, excited great admiration at the port,  all saying that she was the finest and largest ship that had ever been  seen there. While her fitting out had been going on she was hove up on  shore and received several coats of paint. Edmund was loath to start on  his voyage without again seeing the king, but no one knew where Alfred  now was, he, on finding the struggle hopeless, having retired to the  fastnesses of Somerset to await the time when the Saxons should be  driven by oppression again to take up arms.    At last all was ready, and the Dragon put out to sea. She was provided  with oars as well as sails, but these were only to be used when in  pursuit, or when flying from a superior enemy. As soon as she had been  long enough at sea to enable the band again to recover from the effects  of sickness the oars were got out and the men practised in their use.    As in the models from which she had been built, she rowed two banks of  oars, the one worked by men upon deck, the others through small  port-holes. The latter could only be used when the weather was fine;  when the sea was high they were closed up and fastened. The lower-deck  oars were each rowed by one man, while the upper bank, which were  longer and heavier, had each two men to work it.    Before starting Edmund had increased the strength of his band to ninety  men, that number being required for the oars, of which the Dragon had  fifteen on each bank on each side.
