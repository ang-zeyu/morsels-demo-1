The adult butterflies continue their leisurely life  for a fortnight or more, thus extending the laying of the eggs over a  considerable period.    About a week after being deposited the egg hatches into a tiny green  caterpillar that begins feeding upon the tender surface of the cabbage  leaf. It is commonly called the cabbage worm and it is doubtless the  most generally destructive insect affecting this crop. It continues to  feed for several days before the first moult, after which it becomes  decidedly larger and begins to eat again more voraciously than before.  It undergoes several successive moults during the next two or three  weeks before it becomes full grown as a caterpillar. Unlike most  butterfly larvae it has changed very little in its general appearance  during its growth. It is always of a pale green color, strikingly like  the glaucous green of the cabbage leaf, a fact which doubtless helps  to conceal it from the eager eyes of birds and other animals.    When the caterpillar is thus full fed it is likely to leave its food  plant and find shelter elsewhere. Sometimes it will stop on the lower  surface of the outer leaves, but more commonly it will find a piece of  board, an overhanging stone, a fence-post, or the side of a building,  where it will prepare for the change to the chrysalis. It will do this  by spinning a silken thread upon the surface in which to entangle its  hind legs and a loop of silk near by with which to hold its body. When  these preparations are completed the insect will cast its last  caterpillar skin, emerging as a grayish or brownish chrysalis, the  color usually varying with the color of the surrounding surface.    A week or more later the chrysalis skin bursts open and the white  butterfly emerges to expand and dry its wings before it flies away for  its leisurely life. There are two or more broods each season, the  number varying with the latitude. There is a decided variation in the  length of time required for the completion of the cycle from egg to  butterfly. In hot weather the insect may mature in about three weeks  while in cooler weather it may require as much as five weeks.      _Its Introduction and Dispersal_    While it is well known that a large proportion of our most destructive  insects have been imported from Europe, it is only in comparatively  few cases that man has been able to make careful records of the times  and places where the insects were introduced and to follow the spread  of the pest from these original centres. The Imported Cabbage  butterfly is one of the few species of which this is true. This insect  has been known for centuries in Europe, where it feeds freely upon the  leaves of cabbages and turnips. So far as known it was first  introduced into North America about 1860, when it appeared in Quebec.  Eight years later it was again introduced into the region of New York  City. From these two points the insect spread gradually in various  directions until in 1871 it covered the whole of New England and  various parts of New York and New Jersey. From then on it spread even  more rapidly and was evidently accidentally introduced into various  parts of the country which became new centres of distribution. Of  course it would be very easy for this to happen through the shipment  of cabbages from one part of the country to another. Within thirty  years of the time of its first introduction it had become a serious  pest over practically all the United States and Canada.    The introduction and spread of such a pest is of interest in itself,  but in this case there is to be noted the additional fact that the  presence of this foreigner has practically led to the extinction of  two native species of butterflies, both closely related to each other  and to the invader and both feeding upon the same plants. An almost  pure white butterfly--the Gray-veined White--was formerly exceedingly  abundant in many of the Northern states, while farther south there was  another species, the Checkered White, which was also abundant. Both of  these have now so completely disappeared that in some localities they  are almost never seen, while their imported relative has become  perhaps the most abundant of all American butterflies.       =The Gray-veined White=    _Pieris napi_    One would naturally suppose that when a butterfly was reduced to the  greatest possible simplicity in its coloring there would be little  chance for the development of geographical or seasonal varieties. But  he would only have to study a large collection of specimens of this  species, taken at different seasons and in different regions, to find  his supposition at fault. Here is a butterfly which is essentially a  slender black-bodied creature with four white wings scarcely touched  with color, and yet we are told that there are eleven varieties in the  United States so distinct that they have received scientific names,  not to mention various others which have been found in Europe. This  is indeed a remarkable showing and it is a striking illustration of  the infinite variations which Nature can produce with the most limited  materials.    To me the seasonal variations of a butterfly are always of greater  interest than those which are geographical. We know that in the case  of a great many animals, from insects to mammals, the different  conditions of climate and physical environment found in different  regions produce variations of many sorts. So it does not seem  especially strange that in Alaska there should be a different form of  a certain butterfly than is found in Virginia. But that in the same  locality there should be two or more forms of a butterfly existing  under identical conditions as to climate and environment is not so  easily explained. In the case of the Gray-veined White we collect in  early spring in New England, or other Northern states, a lot of  chrysalids. We keep them until the butterflies come forth and we find  even here two distinct forms, one smaller and more delicate than the  other, with both surfaces of the wings pure white: scientists call  this form, _virginiensis_; the other larger with the under surface of  the wings slightly tinted with yellow: scientists call this form  _oleracea_. The first named has but one brood a year while the second  lays eggs which develop into caterpillars that produce butterflies of  still a _third_ form, in which the upper surface of the wings is pure  white with a slightly greater expanse: scientists call this form  _cruciferarum_. These three varieties occur in Eastern regions and may  be found in the same localities, and differ considerably from various  geographical varieties found in the Far West.    The caterpillar of the Gray-veined White is a bit smaller than those  of the nearly related forms, and in color is green with no distinct  longitudinal markings, but with many fine dots of black over the  surface. The cylindrical body is covered with a fine down. When  feeding upon cabbage it is more likely to attack the outer than the  inner leaves, and so even when abundant it is less troublesome to  gardeners than the imported species. It is now, however, so rare that  it seems to feed chiefly upon wild cruciferous plants and is more  likely to be found along the borders of open woods than in gardens and  fields. The winter is passed in the chrysalis state.       =The Checkered White=    _Pontia protodice_    Some years ago the Checkered White was commonly called the Southern  Cabbage Butterfly but the general distribution of the imported species  has had the same effect upon its abundance in the South that it has  had upon the Gray-veined White in the North. Consequently, it is now  much less abundant than formerly, even in the Southern states where it  is most at home. There are two fairly distinct forms: the spring form  and the summer form. The latter is practically of the same size as the  Imported Cabbage Butterfly: the males have the hind wings nearly white  above and the fore wings with a few black dots or spots upon their  outer halves. The females are much more definitely marked, having the  upper surface of both pairs of wings marked in black or brownish black  in such a way as to enclose a large number of white diamonds. The  spring form is decidedly smaller and the markings are much less  distinct than in the summer form.    The seasonal history of this species is comparatively simple. In  winter the chrysalids are found. From these chrysalids in early spring  the small butterflies of the spring form come forth. These lay eggs  upon various cruciferous plants which hatch into greenish caterpillars  that eat the leaves and soon mature so far as their caterpillar stage  is concerned. They are then about an inch long, with downy cylindric  bodies more or less marked with rather pale yellow stripes, touched  here and there with purplish green or dotted slightly with fine black  dots. These caterpillars now attach themselves by means of a button of  silk and a silken loop to some support like a piece of board, the side  of a stone, or almost any available shelter. Each casts its larval  skin and appears as a grayish chrysalis from which probably a  fortnight later the summer form of the butterfly emerges. There are  commonly two broods of this summer form, making three sets of  butterflies for the entire season. The caterpillars of the second  summer brood of butterflies go into the chrysalis stage in autumn to  remain throughout the winter.    Some very interesting observations upon the sleeping habits of this  butterfly have been made in St. Louis by Mr. and Mrs. Phil Rau. The  insects were found abundantly resting upon the seed heads of white  snakeroot. Early in October, when a warm south wind was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],[0,"An Introduction to Chemical Science (#16)"],[1,"part of this blue  central cone has heat enough to act in this way. By using a  prepared piece of metal, to make the flame thin and to shut off  the air, and then blowing the flame with a blow-pipe, greater  strength can be obtained in both oxidizing and reducing flames  (Fig. 36).    147. Combustible and Supporter Interchangeable.-- H was found to  burn in O. H was the combustible, O the supporter. Would O itself  burn in H?--i.e. would the combustible become the supporter, and  the supporter the combustible? As illuminating gas consists  largely of H, and as air is part O, we may try the experiment  with gas and air. Gas will burn in air. Will air burn in gas?    Experiment 85.--Fit a cork with two holes in it to the large end  of a lamp chimney. Through each hole pass a short piece of  tubing, and connect one of these with a rubber tube leading to a  gas-jet. Pass a metallic tube, long enough to reach the top of  the chimney, through the other, so that it will move easily up  and down. Turn on the gas, and light it at the top of the  chimney. Hold the end of the tube passing through the cork in the  flame for a minute, then draw it down to the middle of the  chimney (Fig. 37, a) and finally slowly remove it (b). Note that  O from the air is burning in the gas. Which is the supporter, and  which the combustible in this case? O will burn equally well in  an atmosphere of H, as can be shown by experiment.    148. Explosive Mixture of Gases.    Experiment 86.--Slowly turn down the burning gas of a Bunsen  lamp, having the orifices open, and notice that it suddenly  explodes and goes out at the top, but now burns at the base. As  the gas was gradually turned off, more air became mixed with it,  until there was the right proportion of each gas for an  explosion. Figure 38 shows the same thing. Light the gas at the  top a, when the tube c covers the jet b. Then gradually raise the  tube c. At a certain place there is the same explosion as with  the lamp.    149. Generalizations.--These experiments show (1) that three  conditions are necessary for combustion,--a combustible, a  supporter, and a burning temperature which varies for different  substances. Given these, \"a fire\" always results. The conditions  for \"spontaneous combustion\" do not differ from those of any  combustion. See Experiments 34, 112, 113, 114. (2) That  combustible and supporter are interchangeable. If H burns in O, O  will burn in H, the product, being the same in each case. (3) For  any combustion there must be a certain proportion of combustible  and of supporter. Twenty per cent of CO2 in the air dilutes the O  to such an extent that C will not burn. Hence the utility of the  chemical engine for putting out fires. (4) When two    gases, a combustible and a supporter, are mixed in the requisite  proportion, they form an explosive mixture, needing only the  kindling temperature to unite them.    Chemical combination is always accompanied by disengagement of  heat. Chemical dissociation is always accompanied by absorption  of heat. The disengagement, or the absorption, is not always  evident to the senses.    Combustion is the chemical combination of two or more substances  with the self-evident disengagement of great heat, and usually of  light.    The temperature of ignition varies greatly with different  substances. PH3 burns spontaneously at the usual temperatures of  the air. P takes fire at 60 degrees, but even at 10 degrees it  oxidizes with rapidity enough to produce phosphorescence. The  vapor of CS2 may be set on fire by a glass rod heated to 150  degrees, but a red-hot iron will not ignite illuminating gas.    Spontaneous combustion often takes place in woolen or cotton rags  which have been saturated with oil. The oil rapidly absorbs O,  and sets fire to the cloth. This is thought to be the origin of  some very destructive fires.    CHAPTER XXX.    CHLORINE.    150. Preparation.    Experiment 87.--Put into a t.t. 5 g. of fine granular MnO2 and 10  cc. HCl. Apply heat carefully, and collect the gas by downward  displacement in a receiver loosely covered with paper (Fig. 39).  Add more HCl if needed. Have a good draft of air, and do not  inhale the gas. If you have accidentally breathed it, inhale  alcohol vapor from a handkerchief; alcohol has great affinity for  Cl. Note the color of the gas, and compare its weight with that  of air.    MnO2 + 4 HCl = MnCl2 + 2 H2O + 2 Cl. How much Cl can be separated  with 5 g. MnO2?    If preferred, a flask may be used for a generator instead of a  t.t. Cl can be obtained directly from NaCl by adding H2SO4 (which  produces HCl) and MnO2. 2 NaCl + 2 H2SO4 + MnO2 = MnSO4 + Na2SO4  + 2 H2O + 2 Cl. Try the experiment, using a t.t. and adding  water.    151. Cl from Bleaching-Powder.    Experiment 88.--Put a few grams of bleaching- powder into a small  beaker, and set this into a larger one. Cover the latter with  pasteboard or paper, through which passes a thistle-tube reaching  into the small beaker (Fig. 40). Pour through the tube a little  H2SO4 dilated with its volume of H2O.    152. Chlorine Water.--A solution of Cl in water is often useful,  and may be made as follows:-- Experiment 89.--To 3 or 4 crystals  of KClO3 add a few drops of HCl. Heat a minute, and when the gas  begins to disengage, pour in 10 cc. H2O, which dissolves the gas.  2 KClO3 + 4 HCl = 2 KCl + Cl2O4 + 2 H2O + 2 Cl.    153. Bleaching Properties.    Experiment 90.--Put into a receiver of Cl, preferably before  generating it, two pieces of Turkey red cloth, one wet, the other  dry; a small piece of printed paper and a written one; also a red  rose or a green leaf, each wet. Note from which the color is  discharged. If it is not discharged from all, put a little H2O  into the receiver, shake it well, and state what ones are  bleached.    Experiment 91.--(1) Add 5 cc. of Cl water to 5 cc. of indigo  solution. (2) Treat in the same way 5 cc. K2Cr2O7 (potassium  dichromate) solution, and record the results.    Indigo, writing-ink, and Turkey red or madder, are vegetable  pigments; printer's ink contains C, and K2Cr2O7 is a mineral  pigment. State what coloring matters Cl will bleach.    154. Disinfecting Power.    Experiment 92.--Pass a little H2S gas from a generator into a  t.t. containing Cl water. Look for a deposit of S. Notice that  the odor of H2S disappears. H2S + 2 Cl = 2 HCl + S.    155. A Supporter of Combustion.    Experiment 93.--Sprinkle into a receiver of Cl a very little fine  powder or filings of Cu, As, or Sb, and notice the combustion.  Observe that here is a case of combustion in which O does not  take part. Chlorides of the metals are of course formed. Write  the reactions. See whether Cl will support the combustion of  paper or of a stick of wood.    Experiment 94.--Warm 2 or 3 cc. of oil of turpentine (C1OH16) in  an evaporating-dish; dip a piece of tissue paper into it, and  very quickly thrust this into a receiver of Cl. It should take  fire and deposit carbon. C1OH16 + 16 Cl = ? Test the moisture on  the sides of the receiver with litmus. Clean the receiver with a  little petroleum.    Experiment 95.--Prepare a H generator with a lamp-tube bent as in  Figure 41. Light the H, observing the cautions in Experiment 23,  and when well burning, lower the flame into a receiver of Cl.  Observe the change of color which the flame undergoes as it comes  in contact with Cl. Give the reaction for the burning. Test with  litmus any moisture on the sides of the receiver. A mixture of Cl  and H, in direct sunlight combines with explosive violence;  whereas in diffused sunlight it combines slowly, and in darkness  it does not combine. From these experiments state the chief  properties of Cl, and what combustion it will support.    [Figure 41.]    156. Sources and Uses.--The great source of Cl is NaCl, though it  is often made from HCl. Its chief use is in making bleaching-  powder, one pound of which will bleach 300 to 500 pounds of  cloth. Cl is very easily liberated from this powder by a dilute  acid, or, slowly, by taking moisture from the air. Hence its use  as a disinfectant in destroying noxious gases and the germs of  infectious diseases. Cl attacks organic matter and germs as it  does the membrane of the throat or lungs, owing to its affinity  for H.    Cl is the best bleaching agent for cotton goods. It is not  suitable for animal materials, such as silk and wool, as it  attacks their fiber. It does not discharge either mineral or  carbon colors. The chemistry of bleaching is obscure.    As dry material will not bleach, Cl seems to unite with H in H2O  and to set O free. The O then unites with some portion of the  coloring matter, oxidizing it, and breaking up its molecule.  Colors bleached by Cl cannot be restored.    Chapter XXXI.    BROMINE.    Examine bromine, potassium bromide, sodium bromide, magnesium  bromide.    157. Preparation.    Experiment 96.--Pulverize 2 or 3 g. KBr, and mix it with about  the same bulk of MnO2. After putting this into a t.t, add as much  H2SO4, mix them together by shaking, attach a d.t., and conduct  the end of it into a t.t. that is immersed in a bottle of cold  water. Slowly heat the contents of the t.t., and notice the color  of the escaping vapor, and any liquid that condenses in the  receiver. Avoid inhaling the fumes, or getting them into the  eyes.    MnO2 + 2 KBr + 2 H2SO4 = ? Compare this with the equation for  making Cl from NaCl.    158. Tests.    Experiment 97.--Try the bleaching action of Br vapor as in the  case of Cl. Bleach a piece of litmus paper, and try to restore  the color with NH4OH. Explain its bleaching and disinfecting  action. Try the combustibility of As, Sb, and Cu.    159. Description.--Bromine at usual temperatures is a liquid  element; it is the only common one except Hg; it. quickly  evaporates on exposure to air. The chemistry of its manufacture  is like that of Cl; its bleaching and disinfecting powers are  similar to the latter, though"]]]
