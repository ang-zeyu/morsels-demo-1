Long Tom, with Charlie perched in front of  him, followed them, and the three men-at-arms brought up the rear. Charlie  was in high spirits; he regarded the trip as a sort of holiday, and had  been talking, ever since he got up, of the wonders that he should see in  Paris. Agnes better understood the situation, and nothing but the feeling  that she ought to emulate the calmness of her mother restrained her from  bursting into tears when her father lifted her on to her seat. The herald  led the way, followed by his two pursuivants. Dame Margaret checked her  horse in the middle of the court-yard, and said in a loud clear voice to  the tenants and men-at-arms round: \"Adieu, good friends; I trust that I  shall not be long away from you. I go to stay for a time at the court in  Paris, and I leave you with the surety that you will have peace and rest  until I return, and be able to repair the damages you suffered from the  attack made upon us by men who regard not the law.\" She turned and waved  her hand to Sir Eustace, who was standing immovable on the steps, and  then, touching the horse with her heel, they moved on after the herald.    \"Do not fear to speak, Tom,\" Dame Margaret said, after they had left the  castle behind them; \"the journey is a long one, and it will go all the  quicker for honest talk. What think you of this expedition to Paris?\"    \"I would as lief go there as anywhere else, my lady. Indeed, men say that  it is a fine city, and as I have never seen a bigger town than  Southampton, I doubt not that I shall find plenty to interest me at times  when you may not require our services.\"    \"I see that you have brought your bow with you.\"    \"Ay, my lady, I could not bring myself to part with it. Sir Eustace told  me that I could not carry it, as its length would be a matter of remark,  and point me out at once as being an Englishman, seeing that the French  archers carry no bows of such length; so I have, even as you see, wrapped  it round with straw, and fastened it to the saddle beneath my leg. I have  also put fourscore arrows among the valises on the pack-horses.\"    \"There is no chance of your needing them, Tom.\"    \"I trust that it is so,\" the archer replied; \"but, indeed, there is never  any saying, and an archer without his bow is but a poor creature,--though,  indeed, I trust that I can swing an axe as well as another.\"    \"And much better than most, Tom; still, I hope that neither axe nor bow  will be required.\"    \"To that I say amen also; for, although a fray may sometimes be to my  taste, I have no desire to be mixed up in a melee without some of my own  stout comrades with me.\"    \"Shall we get to Paris to-night, Lady Mother?\" Charlie asked.    \"No, indeed; it will be five days, if not six, for I see by the way that  we are travelling we are bearing east, and shall sleep at Lille or may be  at Tournay; then, doubtless, we shall bear south, and may stop the next  night at Cambrai, and make to Noyon on the following day, and thence to  Compiegne or to Senlis, and the next day will take us to Paris. It all  depends how far and how fast we ride each day. But these matters will be  arranged by the herald. Were we to go by the shortest route we should get  there more quickly; but Amiens is held by the party to whom the men who  attacked our castle belong, and by the way we are travelling we shall keep  for some time in Artois, and so escape all risk of trouble on the road.\"    \"I don't care for trouble,\" Charlie said stoutly; \"we have got Long Tom  and Robert Picard and the other two, and Guy can fight also.\"    \"That would be all very well, my son,\" his mother said smiling, \"if we  were only attacked by half a dozen vagrants, but brave as they all are  they could do naught if a large body surprised us; but be assured that  there is no fear of that--by the way we are travelling we shall meet with  none but friends.\"    \"I should like to be attacked by the vagrants, mother. The last time you  made us stay with you when there was fighting going on, except just at the  first, but here we should see it all.\"    \"Well, I don't want to see it, Charlie, and I am glad that we are not  likely to do so; and you must remember that you and I and Agnes would  sorely hamper our friends.\"    Nevertheless whenever a party of peasants was met upon the road Charlie  looked out hopefully and heaved a sigh of disappointment when, after  doffing their caps in respect, they passed on quietly. Several times they  encountered bodies of knights and men-at-arms, but the presence of the  royal herald saved them from all question. At each halting-place Dame  Margaret, her children and maid, were lodged in the house of one of the  principal citizens, while Guy and the men-at-arms lay at an inn. The  troubled state of the times was only manifest by the number of men-at-arms  in the streets, and the strict watch kept at the gates of the towns. Many  of these were kept shut, and were only opened once an hour to let people  pass in and out. This, however, did not affect the travellers, for the  gates were opened the moment the emblazonings on the surcoat of the herald  could be made out.    \"We have assuredly nothing to complain of so far, Guy,\" Dame Margaret  said, as they set out on their last day's journey; \"had we been the king's  special guests we could not have been more honourably treated, and I have  no doubt that although we shall be much less important personages at Paris  than as travellers under the royal protection, we shall yet be made  comfortable enough, and shall have naught to grieve over save the  separation from our lord.\"    \"I cannot doubt that it will be so, lady,\" Guy replied; \"and that at any  rate there will be no trouble, unless the Armagnacs lay siege to Paris or  there are riots in the city. I heard last night at the inn from some  travellers who had just left it, that although the majority of the people  there are in favour of Burgundy, yet that much discontent exists on  account of the harsh measures of the officers he has appointed, and  especially of the conduct of the guild of butchers, who, as it seems, are  high in favour with the duke, and rule the city as if it belonged to  them.\"    \"It matters little to us, Guy, though it seems strange that the nobles of  France and the respectable citizens of Paris should allow themselves to be  ruled over by such a scum as that; but it was the same in Flanders, where  Von Artevelde, our ally, a great man and the chief among them, was  murdered by the butchers who at the time held sway in Ghent, and who were  conspicuous for many years in all the tumults in the great towns there.\"    \"I hear, madam, that the king is ill, and can see no one.\"    \"Yes, I have heard the same from the herald. It will be John of Burgundy  who will, for the time, be our master.\"    \"I could desire a better,\" Guy said bluntly; \"but we shall at any rate  know that his fair words are not to be trusted. For my part, however, I  wonder that after the (agreement with) the Duke of Orleans, with whom he had sworn a solemn peace, any man should hold converse with him.\"    \"Unfortunately, Guy, men's interests count for more than their feelings,  and a great noble, who has it in his power to grant favours and dispense  honours, will find adherents though he has waded through blood. Burgundy,  too, as I hear, has winning manners and a soft tongue, and can, when it  pleases him, play the part of a frank and honest man. At least it must be  owned that the title of 'Fearless' does not misbecome him, for, had it  been otherwise, he would have denied all part in the murder of Orleans,  instead of openly avowing that it was done by his orders.\"    They had started at an earlier hour than usual that morning, as the herald  had pointed out to Dame Margaret, that it were best to arrive in Paris as  early as possible, in order that the question of their lodging might be  settled at once. Accordingly, they had been up at daybreak, and arrived in  Paris at noon.    \"How long will it be, I wonder,\" Dame Margaret said, as they rode through  the gates, \"before we shall pass through here again?\"    \"Not very long I hope, my lady,\" Guy said; \"but be sure that if at any  time you wish to leave we shall be able to procure disguises for you all,  and to make our way out without difficulty.\"    \"Nay, Guy, you forget that it is only so long as we are here that Villeroy  is safe from attack. Whatever happens, nothing, save the news that an  English army has landed at Calais, and is about to invade France, would  leave me free to attempt an escape. If not released before that, I must  then, at all hazards, try to escape, for Sir Eustace, knowing that I am  here, would be placed in a sore strait indeed; both by his own  inclinations and as a vassal of England, for he would want to join the  English as soon as they advanced, and yet would be hindered by the  knowledge that I was a hostage here. It would be for me to relieve him of  that fear; and the same feeling that induced me to come hither would then  take me back to Villeroy.\"    \"Then, madam, I fear that our stay here will be a long one, for Henry has  never pushed on the war with France vigorously, and though plenty of cause  has been given by the capture of his castles in Guienne, he has never  drawn sword either to regain them or to avenge the insults put upon the  English flag.\"    \"King Henry is old, Guy; and they say that his son is as full of spirit  and as fiery as his father is peaceful and indisposed for war. When the  king dies, my lord thinks that it will be but a short time before the  English banner will be unfurled in France; and this is one of the reasons  why he consented to my becoming an hostage, thinking that no long time is  likely to elapse before he will have English backing, and will be able to  disregard the threats of France.\"    \"How narrow and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7065"],[0,"Children of the Bush (#16)"],[1," Bourke.    \"We'll turn off into the scrub and strike the track the other side of  the shanty and come back to it,\" said Steelman. \"You see, if they see us  coming into Bourke they'll say to themselves, `Oh, we're never likely  to see these chaps again,' and they won't give us anything, or, perhaps,  only a pinch of tea or sugar in a big lump of paper. There's some women  that can never see a tucker-bag, even if you hold it right under their  noses. But if they see us going out back they'll reckon that we'll get  a shed likely as not, and we'll be sure to call there with our cheques  coming back. I hope the old man's got the lumbago, or sciatica, or  something.\"    \"Why?\" asked Smith.    \"Because whenever I see an old man poking round the place on a stick  I always make for him straight and inquire about his trouble; and no  matter what complaint he's got, my old man suffered from it for years.  It's pretty hard graft listening to an old man with a pet leg, but I  find it pays; and I always finish up by advising him to try St Jacob's  oil. Perhaps he's been trying it for years, but that doesn't matter; the  consultation works out all right all the same, and there's never been a  remedy tried yet but I've got another.    \"I've got a lot of Maori and blackfellow remedies in my mind, and when  they fail I can fall back on the Chinese; and if that isn't enough I've  got a list of my grandmother's remedies that she wrote down for me when  I was leaving home, and I kept it for a curiosity. It took her three  days to write them, and I reckon they'll fill the bill.    \"You don't want a shave. You look better with that stubble on. You  needn't say anything; just stand by and wear your usual expression, and  if they ask me what's the matter with my mate I'll fix up a disease for  you to have, and get something extra on your account, poor beggar!    \"I wish we had a chap with us that could sing a bit and run the gamut on  a fiddle or something. With a sickly-looking fish like you to stand by  and look interesting and die slowly of consumption all the time, and me  to do the talking, we'd be able to travel from one end of the bush to  the other and live on the fat of the land. I wouldn't cure you for a  hundred pounds:\"    They reached the shanty, and there, sure enough, was an old man  pottering round with a list to starboard. He was working with a hoe  inside a low paling fence round a sort of garden. Steelman and Smith  stopped outside the fence.    \"Good day, boss!\"    \"'Day.\"    \"It's hot.\"    \"It's hot.\"    So far it was satisfactory.    He was a little man, with a wiry, red beard. He might have been a  Scandinavian.    \"You seem to be a bit lame,\" said Steelman. \"Hurt your foot?\"    \"Naw,\" said the old man. \"It's an old thing.\"    \"Ah!\" said Steelman, \"lumbago, I suppose? My father suffered cruel from  it for years.\"    \"Naw,\" said the old man, moving closer to the fence. \"It ain't in me  back; the trouble's with me leg.\"    \"Oh!\" said Steelman. \"One a bit shorter than the other?\"    \"Well, yes. It seems to be wearin' a bit shorter. I must see to it.\"    \"Hip disease, perhaps?\" said Steelman. \"A brother o' mine had----\"    \"Naw, it's not in the hip,\" said the old man. \"My leg's gone at the  knee.\"    \"Oh! stiff joint; I know what that is. Had a touch of it once myself.  An uncle of mine was nearly crippled with it. He used to use St Jacob's  oil. Ever try St Jacob's oil?\"    \"Naw,\" said the old man, \"not that I know of. I've used linseed oil  though.\"    \"Linseed oil!\" said Steelman; \"I've never heard of that for stiff knee.  How do you use it?\"    \"Use it raw,\" said the old man. \"Raw linseed oil; I've rubbed it in, and  I've soaked me leg in it.\"    \"Soaked your leg in it!\" said Steelman. \"And did it do it any good?\"    \"Well, it seems to preserve it--keeps it from warping, and it wears  better--and it makes it heavier. It seemed a bit too light before.\"    Steelman nudged Smith under cover of the palings. The old man was  evidently a bit ratty.    \"Well, I hope your leg will soon be all right, boss,\" said Steelman.    \"Thank you,\" said the old man, \"but I don't think there's much hope. I  suppose you want some tucker?\"    \"Well, yes,\" said Steelman, rather taken aback by the old man's sudden  way of putting it. \"We're hard up.\"    \"Well, come along to the house and I'll see if I can get yer something,\"  said the old man; and they walked along outside the fence, and he  hobbled along inside, till he came to a little gate at the corner.  He opened the gate and stumped out. He had a wooden leg. He wore his  trouser-leg down over it, and the palings had hidden the bottom from  Steelman and Smith.    He wanted them to stay to dinner, but Steelman didn't feel comfortable,  and thanked him, and said they'd rather be getting on (Steelman always  spoke for Smith); so the old man gave them some cooked meat, bread, and  a supply of tea and sugar. Steelman watched his face very close, but he  never moved a muscle. But when they looked back he was leaning on his  hoe, and seemed to be shaking.    \"Took you back a bit, Steely, didn't it?\" suggested Smith.    \"How do you make that out?\" snorted Steelman, turning on him suddenly.  \"I knew a carpenter who used to soak his planes in raw linseed oil to  preserve them and give them weight. There's nothing funny about that.\"    Smith rubbed his head.          A BUSH PUBLICAN'S LAMENT     ... For thirst is long and throats is short      Among the sons o' men.                                         M. J. C.    I Wish I was spifflicated before I ever seen a pub!    You see, it's this way. Suppose a cove comes along on a blazin' hot  day in the drought--an' _you_ ought to know how hell-hot it can be out  here--an' he dumps his swag in the corner of the bar; an' he turns round  an' he ses ter me, \"Look here boss, I ain't got a lonely steever on me,  an' God knows when I'll git one. I've tramped ten mile this mornin', an'  I'll have ter tramp another ten afore to-night. I'm expectin' ter git  on shearin' with of Baldy Thompson at West-o'-Sunday nex' week. I got a  thirst on me like a sun-struck bone, an', for God sake, put up a couple  o' beers for me an' my mate, an' I'll fix it up with yer when I come  back after shearin'.\"    An' what's a feller ter do? I bin there meself, an--I put it to you!  I've known what it is to have a thirst on me.    An' suppose a poor devil comes along in the jim-jams, with every inch  on him jumpin' an' a look in his eyes like a man bein' murdered an' sent  ter hell, an' a whine in his voice like a whipped cur, an' the snakes  a-chasing of him; an' he hooks me with his finger ter the far end o'  the bar--as if he was goin' ter tell me that the world was ended--an' he  hangs over the bar an' chews me lug, an' tries to speak, an' breaks off  inter a sort o' low shriek, like a terrified woman, an' he says, \"For  Mother o' Christ's sake, giv' me a drink!\" An' what am I to do? I bin  there meself. I knows what the horrors is. He mighter blued his cheque  at the last shanty. But what am I ter do? I put it ter you. If I let him  go he might hang hisself ter the nex' leanin' tree.    What's a drink? yer might arst--I don't mind a drink or two; but when it  comes to half a dozen in a day it mounts up, I can tell yer. Drinks is  sixpence here--I have to pay for it, an' pay carriage on it. It's all up  ter me in the end. I used sometimes ter think it was lucky I wasn't west  o' the sixpenny line, where I'd lose a shillin' on every drink I give  away.    An' supposen a sundowner comes along smokin' tea-leaves, an' ses ter  me, \"Look her, boss! me an' my mate ain't had a smoke for three days!\"  What's a man ter do? I put it ter you! I'm a heavy smoker meself, an'  I've known what it is to be without a smoke on the track. But \"nail-rod\"  is ninepence a stick out here, an' I have ter pay carriage. It all  mounts up, I can tell yer.    An' supposen Ole King Billy an' his ole black gin comes round at holiday  time and squats on the verander, an' blarneys an' wheedles and whines  and argues like a hundred Jews an' ole Irishwomen put tergether, an'  accuses me o' takin' his blarsted country from him, an' makes me an' the  missus laugh; an' we gives him a bottl'er rum an' a bag of grub ter get  rid of him an' his rotten ole scarecrow tribe--It all tells up. I was  allers soft on the blacks, an', beside, a ole gin nursed me an' me  mother when I was born, an' saved me blessed life--not that that mounts  to much. But it all tells up, an' I got me licence ter pay. An' some  bloody skunk goes an' informs on me for supplyin' the haboriginalls with  intossicatin' liquor, an' I have ter pay a fine an' risk me licence. But  what's a man ter do?    An' three or four herrin'-gutted jackaroos comes along about  dinner-time, when the table's set and the cookin' smellin' from the  kichen, with their belts done up three holes, an' not the price of a  feed on 'em. What's a man ter do? I've known what it is ter do a perish  on the track meself. It's not the tucker I think on. I don't care a  damn for that. When the shearers come every one is free to go inter the  kitchin an' forage for hisself when he feels hungry--so long as he pays  for his drink. But the jackaroos can't pay for drinks, an' I have ter  pay carriage on the flour an' tea an' sugar an' groceries--an' it all  tells up by the end o' the year.    An' a straight chap that knows me gets a job to take a flock o' sheep  or a mob o' cattle ter the bloomin' Gulf, or South Australia, or  somewheers--an' loses one of his horses goin' out ter take charge, an'  borrers eight quid from me ter buy another. He'll turn up agen in a  year or two an' most likely want ter make me take twenty quid for that  eight--an' make everybody about the place blind drunk--but I've got ter  wait, an' the wine an' sperit merchants an' the brewery won't. They know  I can't do without liquor in the place.    An' lars' rains Jimmy Nowlett, the bullick-driver,"]]]
