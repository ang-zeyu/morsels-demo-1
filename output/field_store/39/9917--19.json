And hark! at other tables discord reigns,  With feign'd contempt for losses and for gains;  Passions awhile are bridled:  then they rage,  In waspish youth, and in resentful age;  With scraps of insult--\"Sir, when next you play,  Reflect whose money 'tis you throw away.  No one on earth can less such things regard,  But when one's partner doesn't know a card -  I scorn suspicion, ma'am, but while you stand  Behind that lady, pray keep down your hand.\"     \"Good heav'n, revoke:  remember, if the set  Be lost, in honour you should pay the debt.\"     \"There, there's your money; but, while I have life,  I'll never more sit down with man and wife;  They snap and snarl indeed, but in the heat  Of all their spleen, their understandings meet;  They are Freemasons, and have many a sign,  That we, poor devils! never can divine:  May it be told, do ye divide th' amount,  Or goes it all to family account?\"             ---------------------       Next is the Club, where to their friends in town  Our country neighbours once a month come down;  We term it Free-and-Easy, and yet we  Find it no easy matter to be free:  E'en in our small assembly, friends among,  Are minds perverse, there's something will be wrong;  Men are not equal; some will claim a right  To be the kings and heroes of the night;  Will their own favourite themes and notions start,  And you must hear, offend them, or depart.     There comes Sir Thomas from his village-seat,  Happy, he tells us, all his friends to meet;  He brings the ruin'd brother of his wife,  Whom he supports, and makes him sick of life;  A ready witness whom he can produce  Of all his deeds--a butt for his abuse;  Soon as he enters, has the guests espied,  Drawn to the fire, and to the glass applied -  \"Well, what's the subject?--what are you about?  The news, I take it--come, I'll help you out:\" -  And then, without one answer he bestows  Freely upon us all he hears and knows;  Gives us opinions, tells us how he votes,  Recites the speeches, adds to them his notes;  And gives old ill-told tales for new-born anecdotes:  Yet cares he nothing what we judge or think,  Our only duty's to attend and drink:  At length, admonish'd by his gout he ends  The various speech, and leaves at peace his friends;  But now, alas! we've lost the pleasant hour,  And wisdom flies from wine's superior power.     Wine like the rising sun, possession gains,  And drives the mist of dulness from the brains;  The gloomy vapour from the spirit flies,  And views of gaiety and gladness rise:  Still it proceeds; till from the glowing heat,  The prudent calmly to their shades retreat:  -  Then is the mind o'ercast--in wordy rage  And loud contention angry men engage;  Then spleen and pique, like fireworks thrown in spite,  To mischief turn the pleasures of the night;  Anger abuses, Malice loudly rails,  Revenge awakes, and Anarchy prevails;  Till wine, that raised the tempest, makes its cease,  And maudlin Love insists on instant peace;  He, noisy mirth and roaring song commands,  Gives idle toasts, and joins unfriendly bands:  Till fuddled Friendship vows esteem and weeps,  And jovial Folly drinks and sings and sleeps.                -----------------------       A Club there is of Smokers--Dare you come  To that close, clouded, hot, narcotic room?  When, midnight past, the very candles seem  Dying for air, and give a ghastly gleam;  When curling fumes in lazy wreaths arise,  And prosing topers rub their winking eyes;  When the long tale, renew'd when last they met,  Is spliced anew, and is unfinish'd yet;  When but a few are left the house to tire,  And they half sleeping by the sleepy fire;  E'en the poor ventilating vane that flew  Of late so fast, is now grown drowsy too;  When sweet, cold, clammy punch its aid bestows,  Then thus the midnight conversation flows:  -     \"Then, as I said, and--mind me--as I say,  At our last meeting--you remember\"--\"Ay?\"  \"Well, very well--then freely as I drink  I spoke my thought--you take me--what I think.  And, sir, said I, if I a Freeman be,  It is my bounden duty to be free.\"     \"Ay, there you posed him:  I respect the Chair,  But man is man, although the man's a mayor;  If Muggins live--no, no!--if Muggins die,  He'll quit his office--neighbour, shall I try?\"     \"I'll speak my mind, for here are none but friends:  They're all contending for their private ends;  No public spirit--once a vote would bring,  I say a vote--was then a pretty thing;  It made a man to serve his country and his king:  But for that place, that Muggins must resign,  You've my advice--'tis no affair of mine.\"               ----------------------       The Poor Man has his Club:  he comes and spends  His hoarded pittance with his chosen friends;  Nor this alone,--a monthly dole he pays,  To be assisted when his health decays;  Some part his prudence, from the day's supply,  For cares and troubles in his age, lays by;  The printed rules he guards with painted frame,  And shows his children where to read his name;  Those simple words his honest nature move,  That bond of union tied by laws of love;  This is his pride, it gives to his employ  New value, to his home another joy;  While a religious hope its balm applies  For all his fate inflicts, and all his state denies.     Much would it please you, sometimes to explore  The peaceful dwellings of our Borough poor:  To view a sailor just return'd from sea,  His wife beside; a child on either knee,  And others crowding near, that none may lose  The smallest portions of the welcome news;  What dangers pass'd, \"When seas ran mountains high,  When tempest raved, and horrors veil'd the sky;  When prudence fail'd, when courage grew dismay'd,  When the strong fainted, and the wicked pray'd, -  Then in the yawning gulf far down we drove,  And gazed upon the billowy mount above;  Till up that mountain, swinging with the gale,  We view'd the horrors of the watery vale.\"     The trembling children look with steadfast eyes,  And, panting, sob involuntary sighs:  Soft sleep awhile his torpid touch delays,  And all is joy and piety and praise.              --------------------       Masons are ours, Freemasons--but, alas!  To their own bards I leave the mystic class;  In vain shall one, and not a gifted man,  Attempt to sing of this enlightened clan:  I know no Word, boast no directing Sign,  And not one Token of the race is mine;  Whether with Hiram, that wise widow's son,  They came from Tyre to royal Solomon,  Two pillars raising by their skill profound,  Boaz and Jachin through the east renown'd:  Whether the sacred Books their rise express,  Or books profane, 'tis vain for me guess:  It may be lost in date remote and high,  They know not what their own antiquity:  It may be, too, derived from cause so low,  They have no wish their origin to show:  If, as Crusaders, they combine to wrest  From heathen lords the land they long possess'd;  Or were at first some harmless club, who made  Their idle meetings solemn by parade;  Is but conjecture--for the task unfit,  Awe-struck and mute, the puzzling theme I quit:  Yet, if such blessings from their Order flow,  We should be glad their moral code to know;  Trowels of silver are but simple things,  And Aprons worthless as their apron-strings;  But if indeed you have the skill to teach  A social spirit, now beyond our reach;  If man's warm passions you can guide and bind,  And plant the virtues in the wayward mind;  If you can wake to Christian love the heart, -  In mercy, something of your powers impart.     But, as it seems, we Masons must become  To know the Secret, and must then be dumb;  And as we venture for uncertain gains,  Perhaps the profit is not worth the pains.     When Bruce, that dauntless traveller, thought he stood  On Nile's first rise, the fountain of the flood,  And drank exulting in the sacred spring,  The critics told him it was no such thing;  That springs unnumber'd round the country ran,  But none could show him where the first began:  So might we feel, should we our time bestow,  To gain these Secrets and these Signs to know;  Might question still if all the truth we found,  And firmly stood upon the certain ground;  We might our title to the Mystery dread,  And fear we drank not at the river-head.               ---------------------       Griggs and Gregorians here their meeting hold,  Convivial Sects, and Bucks alert and bold;  A kind of Masons, but without their sign;  The bonds of union--pleasure, song, and wine.  Man, a gregarious creature, loves to fly  Where he the trackings of the herd can spy;  Still to be one with many he desires,  Although it leads him through the thorns and briers.     A few! but few there are, who in the mind  Perpetual source of consolation find:  The weaker many to the world will come,  For comforts seldom to be found from home.  When the faint hands no more a brimmer hold,  When flannel-wreaths the useless limbs infold,  The breath impeded, and the bosom cold;  When half the pillow'd man the palsy chains,  And the blood falters in the bloated veins, -  Then, as our friends no further aid supply  Than hope's cold phrase and courtesy's soft sigh,  We should that comfort for ourselves ensure,  Which friends could not, if we could friends procure.     Early in life, when we can laugh aloud,  There's something pleasant in a social crowd,  Who laugh with us--but will such joy remain  When we lie struggling on the bed of pain?  When our physician tells us with a sigh,  No more on hope and science to rely,  Life's staff is useless then; with labouring breath  We pray for Hope divine--the staff of Death; -  This is a scene which few companions grace,  And where the heart's first favourites yield their place.     Here all the aid of man to man must end,  Here mounts the soul to her eternal Friend:  The tenderest love must here its tie resign,  And give th' aspiring heart to love divine.     Men feel their weakness,"]]]
