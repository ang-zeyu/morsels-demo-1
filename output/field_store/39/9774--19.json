A  moment's thought and he recollected he had left it in his room.    As he reached the next street-lamp he hesitated. Ahead of him was a long  area of unlighted thoroughfare. Evidently the lamp-lighter had neglected  his duties. Or, Peter Gross reflected, some malicious hand might have  extinguished the lights. It was on this very portion of the lane that  Captain Rouse's cottage stood, only a few hundred yards farther.    He listened sharply a moment. Back in the shadows off from the lane a  piano tinkled, the langorous Dream Waltz from the Tales of Hoffman. A  lighted victoria clattered toward him, then turned into a brick-paved  driveway. Else not a sound. The very silence was ominous.    Walking slowly, to accustom his eyes to the gloom, Peter Gross left the  friendly circle of light. As the shadows began to envelop him he heard  the sound of running feet on turf. Some one inside the hedge was trying  to overhaul him. He broke into a dog-trot.    A low whistle cut the silence. Leaping forward, he broke into a sprint.  Rouse's cottage was only a hundred yards ahead--a dash and he would be  there.    A whistle from in front. A like sound from the other side of the lane.  The stealthy tap-tapping of feet, sandaled feet, from every direction.    For a moment Peter Gross experienced the sensation of a hunted creature  driven to bay. It was only for a moment, however, and then he acquainted  himself with his surroundings in a quick, comprehensive glance. On one  side of him was the hedge, on the other a line of tall kenari-trees.    Vaulting the hedge, he ran silently and swiftly in its shadow, hugging  the ground like a fox in the brush. Suddenly and without warning he  crashed full-tilt into a man coming from the opposite direction, caught  him low, just beneath the ribs. The man crashed back into the hedge with  an explosive gasp.    Ahead were white pickets, the friendly white pickets that enclosed  Captain Rouse's grounds. He dashed toward them, but he was too late. Out  of a mass of shrubbery a short, squat figure leaped at him. There was  the flash of a knife. Peter Gross had no chance to grapple with his  assailant. He dropped like a log, an old sailor's trick, and the short,  squat figure fell over him. He had an instant glimpse of a yellow face,  fiendish in its malignancy, of a flying queue, of fingers that groped  futilely, then he rose.    At the same instant a cat-like something sprang on him from behind,  twisted its legs around his body, and fastened its talons into his  throat. The impact staggered him, but as he found his footing he tore  the claw-like fingers loose and shook the creature off. Simultaneously  two shadows in front of him materialized into Chinamen with gleaming  knives. As they leaped at him a red-hot iron seared his right forearm  and a bolt of lightning numbed his left shoulder.    A sound like a hoarse, dry cackle came from Peter Gross's throat. His  long arms shot out and each of his huge hands caught one of his  assailants by the throat. Bringing their heads together with a sound  like breaking egg-shells, he tossed them aside.    Before he could turn to flee a dozen shadowy forms semi-circled about  him. The starlight dimly revealed gaunt, yellow faces and glaring eyes,  the eyes of a wolf-pack. The circle began to narrow. Knives glittered.  But none of the crouching forms dared venture within reach of the  gorilla arms.    Then the lion arose in Peter Gross. Beside him was an ornamental iron  flower-pot. Stooping quickly, he seized it and lifted it high above his  head. They shrank from him, those crouching forms, with shrill pipings  of alarm, but it was too late. He hurled it at the foremost. It caught  two of them and bowled them over like ninepins. Then he leaped at the  others. His mighty right caught one under the chin and laid him flat.  His left dove into the pit of another's stomach. The unfortunate  Chinaman collapsed like a sack of grain.    They ringed him round. A sharp, burning sensation swept across his  back--it was the slash of a knife. A blade sank into the fleshy part of  his throat, and he tore it impatiently away. He struck out savagely  into the densely packed mass of humanity and a primitive cave-man surge  of joy thrilled him at the impact of his fists against human flesh and  bone.    But the fight was too unequal. Blood started from a dozen cuts; it  seemed to him he was afire within and without. His blows began to lack  power and a film came over his eyes, but he struck out the more  savagely, furious at his own weakness. The darkness thickened. The  figures before him, beside him, behind him, became more confused. Two  and three heads bobbed where he thought there was only one. His blows  went wild. The jackals were pulling the lion down.    As he pulled himself together for a last desperate effort to plough  through to the security of Rouse's home, the sharp crack of a revolver  sounded in his ear. At the same instant the lawn leaped into a blinding  light, a light in which the gory figures of his assailants stood out in  dazed and uncertain relief. The acrid fumes of gunpowder filled his  nostrils.    Darting toward the hedges like rats scurrying to their holes, the  Chinamen sought cover. Peter Gross hazily saw two men, white men, each  of them carrying a flash-light and a pistol, vault the pickets. A third  followed, swinging a lantern and bellowing for the \"_wacht_\" (police).  It was Roaring Rory.    \"Are you hurt?\" the foremost asked as he approached.    \"Not bad, I guess,\" Peter Gross replied thickly. He lifted his hand to  his forehead in a dazed, uncertain way and looked stupidly at the blood  that gushed over it. A cleft seemed to open at his feet. He felt himself  sinking--down, down, down to the very foundations of the world. Dimly he  heard the cry:    \"Quick, Paddy, lend a hand.\"    Then came oblivion.          CHAPTER X    CAPTAIN CARVER SIGNS      When Peter Gross recovered consciousness fifteen minutes later he found  himself in familiar quarters. He was lying on a cot in Captain Rouse's  den, commonly designated by that gentleman as \"the cabin.\" Captain  Rouse's face, solemn as an owl's, was leaning over him. As he blinked  the captain's lips expanded into a grin.    \"Wot did I tell ye, 'e's all right!\" the captain roared delightedly.  \"Demmit, ye can't kill a Sunda schooner bucko mate with a little  bloodlettin'. Ah Sing pretty near got ye, eh, Peter?\"    The last was to Peter Gross, who was sitting up and taking inventory of  his various bandages, also of his hosts. There were two strangers in the  room. One was a short, stocky young man with a pugnacious Irish nose,  freckly face, and hair red as a burnished copper boiler. His eyes were  remarkably like the jovial navigator's, Peter Gross observed. The other  was a dark, well-dressed man of about forty, with a military bearing and  reserved air. He bore the stamp of gentility.    \"Captain Carver,\" Roaring Rory announced. \"My old mate, Peter Gross, the  best man as ever served under me.\"    The elder man stepped forward and clasped Peter Gross's hand. The latter  tried to rise, but Carver restrained him.    \"You had better rest a few moments, Mr. Gross,\" he said. There was a  quiet air of authority in his voice that instantly attracted the  resident, who gave him a keen glance.    \"My nevvy, Paddy, Peter, the doggonest young scamp an old sea-horse ever  tried to raise,\" Rouse bellowed. \"I wish I could have him for'ard with a  crew like we used to have on the old _Gloucester Maid_.\" He guffawed  boisterously while the younger of the two strangers, his face aglow with  a magnetic smile, sprang forward and caught Peter Gross's hand in a  quick, dynamic grip.    \"Them's the lads ye've got to thank for bein' here,\" Roaring Rory  announced, with evident pride. \"If they hadn't heard the fracas and  butted in, the Chinks would have got ye sure.\"    \"I rather fancied it was you whom I have to thank for being here,\" Peter  Gross acknowledged warmly. \"You were certainly just in time.\"    \"Captain Rouse is too modest,\" Captain Carver said. \"It was he who heard  the disturbance and jumped to the conclusion you might be--in  difficulty.\"    The old navigator shook his head sadly. \"I warned ye, Peter,\" he said;  \"I warned ye against that old devil, Ah Sing. Didn't I tell you to be  careful at night? Ye ain't fit to be trusted alone, Peter.\"    \"I think you did,\" Peter Gross acknowledged with a twinkle. \"But didn't  you fix our appointment for to-night?\"    \"Ye should have carried a gun,\" Roaring Rory reproved. \"Leastwise a  belayin'-pin. Ye like to use your fists too well, Peter. Fists are no  good against knives. I'm a peace-lovin' man, Peter, 'twould be better  for ye if ye patterned after me.\"    Peter Gross smiled, for Roaring Rory's record for getting into scrapes  was known the length and breadth of the South Pacific. Looking up, he  surprised a merry gleam in Captain Carver's eyes and Paddy striving hard  to remain sober.    \"I'll remember your advice, captain,\" Peter Gross assured.    \"Humph!\" Roaring Rory grunted. \"Well, Peter, is your head clear enough  to talk business?\"    \"I think so,\" Peter Gross replied slowly. \"Have you explained the matter  I came here to discuss?\"    \"Summat, summat,\" Rouse grunted. \"I leave the talking to you, Peter.\"    \"Captain Rouse told me you wanted some one to take charge of a company  of men for a dangerous enterprise somewhere in the South Pacific,\"  Carver replied. \"He said it meant risking life. That might mean anything  to piracy. I understand, however, that your enterprise has official  sanction.\"    \"My appointment is from the governor-general of the Netherlands East  Indies,\" Peter Gross stated.    \"Ah, yes.\"    \"I need a man to drill and lead twenty-five men, all of whom have had  some military training. I want a man who "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3725"],[0,"Famous Men of the Middle Ages (#16)"],[1,"make it appear that the murder  had been committed by Duncan's attendants and he caused the king's  son and heir, Prince Malcolm, to flee from the land. He then made  himself king of Scotland.    Malcolm hastened to England and appealed to King Edward for help.    When the king was told the number of soldiers Malcolm would probably  need he gave orders for double that number to march into Scotland.  Malcolm with this support attacked Macbeth, and after several  well-fought battles drove the usurper from Scotland and took possession  of the throne.    Edward did a great deal during his reign to aid the cause of  Christianity. He rebuilt the ancient Westminster Abbey in London  and erected churches and monasteries in different parts of England.    Edward was long supposed to have made many just laws, and years after  his death the English people, when suffering from bad government,  would exclaim, \"Oh, for the good laws and customs of Edward the  Confessor!\" What he really did was to have the old laws faithfully  carried out.    He died in 1066 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.          WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR    KING FROM 1066-1087    I    On the death of Edward the Confessor the throne of England was claimed  by William, Duke of Normandy.    When Edward took refuge in Normandy after the Danes conquered England,  he stayed at the palace of William. He was very kindly treated  there, and William said that Edward had promised in gratitude that  William should succeed him as king of England.    One day in the year 1066 when William was hunting with a party of  his courtiers in the woods near Rouen, a noble came riding rapidly  toward him shouting, \"Your Highness, a messenger has just arrived  from England, bearing the news that King Edward is dead and that  Harold, the son of Earl Godwin, has been placed on the English  throne.\"    William at once called his nobles together and said to them, \"I  must have your consent that I enforce my claim to England's throne  by arms.\"    [Illustration: HAROLD RECEIVING NEWS OF THE NORMAN INVASION]    The barons gave their consent. So an army of sixty thousand men  was collected and a large fleet of ships was built to carry this  force across the channel.    During the months of preparation William sent an embassy to the  English court to demand of Harold that he give up the throne. Harold  refused.    Soon all England was startled by the news that William had landed  on the English coast at the port of Hastings with a large force.    Harold immediately marched as quickly as possible from the north  to the southern coast. In a week or so he arrived at a place called  Senlac nine miles from Hastings, in the neighborhood of which town  the Norman army was encamped. He took his position on a low range  of hills and awaited the attack of William. His men were tired  with their march, but he encouraged them and bade them prepare for  battle.    On the morning of October 14, 1066, the two armies met. The Norman  foot-soldiers opened the battle by charging on the English stockades.  They ran over the plain to the low hills, singing a war-song at  the top of their voices; but they could not carry the stockades  although they tried again and again. They therefore attacked another  part of the English forces.    William, clad in complete armor, was in the very front of the fight,  urging on his troops. At one time a cry arose in his army that he  was slain and a panic began. William drew off his helmet and rode  along the lines, shouting, \"I live! I live! Fight on! We shall  conquer yet!\"    The battle raged from morning till night. Harold himself fought  on foot at the head of his army and behaved most valiantly. His  men, tired as they were from their forced march, bravely struggled  on hour after hour.    But at last William turned their lines and threw them into confusion.  As the sun went down Harold was killed and his men gave up the  fight.    From Hastings William marched toward London. On the way he received  the surrender of some towns and burned others that would not surrender.  London submitted and some of the nobles and citizens came forth  and offered the English crown to the Norman duke.    On the 25th of December, 1066, the \"Conqueror,\" as he is always  called, was crowned in Westminster Abbey by Archbishop Ealdred.  Both English and Norman people were present. When the question was  asked by the Archbishop, \"Will you have William, Duke of Normandy,  for your king?\" all present answered, \"We will.\"    II    At first William ruled England with moderation. The laws and customs  were not changed, and in a few months after the battle of Hastings  the kingdom was so peaceful that William left it in charge of his  brother and went to Normandy for a visit.    While he was gone many of the English nobles rebelled against him,  and on his return he made very severe laws and did some very harsh  things. He laid waste an extensive territory, destroying all the  houses upon it and causing thousands of persons to die from lack of  food and shelter, because the people there had not sworn allegiance  to him.    He made a law that all lights should be put out and fires covered  with ashes at eight o'clock every evening, so that the people would  have to go to bed then. A bell was rung in all cities and towns  throughout England to warn the people of the hour. The bell was  called the \"curfew,\" from the French words \"_couvre feu_,\" meaning  _to cover fire_.    To find out about the lands of England and their owners, so that  everybody might be made to pay taxes, he appointed officers in  all the towns to report what estates there were, who owned them,  and what they were worth. The reports were copied into two volumes,  called the \"Domesday Book.\" This book showed that England at that  time had a population of a little more than a million.    [Illustration: DEATH OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR]    William made war on Scotland, and conquered it. During a war with  the king of France the city of Mantes (_mont_) was burned by William's  soldiers. As William rode over the ruins his horse stumbled and the  king was thrown to the ground and injured. He was borne to Rouen,  where he lay ill for six weeks. His sons and even his attendants  abandoned him in his last hours. It is said that in his death struggle  he fell from his bed to the floor, where his body was found by his  servants.          PETER THE HERMIT    ABOUT 1050-1115    I    During the Middle Ages the Christians of Europe used to go to the  Holy Land for the purpose of visiting the tomb of Christ and other  sacred places. Those who made such a journey were called \"pilgrims.\"    Every year thousands of pilgrims--kings, nobles and people of humbler  rank--went to the Holy Land.    While Jerusalem was in the hands of the Arabian caliphs who reigned  at Bagdad, the Christian pilgrims were generally well treated. After  about 1070, when the Turks took possession of the city, outrages  became so frequent that it seemed as if it would not be safe for  Christians to visit the Savior's tomb at all.    About the year 1095 there lived at Amiens (_ae-me-an'_) France, a  monk named Peter the Hermit.    Peter was present at a council of clergy and people held at Clermont  in France when his Holiness, Pope Urban II, made a stirring speech.  He begged the people to rescue the Holy Sepulchre and other sacred  sites from the Mohammedans.    The council was so roused by his words that they broke forth into  loud cries, \"God wills it! God wills it!\"    \"It is, indeed, His will,\" said the Pope, \"and let these words be  your war-cry when you meet the enemy.\"    Peter listened with deep attention. Immediately after the council  he began to preach in favor of a war against the Turks. With head  and feet bare, and clothed in a long, coarse robe tied at the waist  with a rope, he went through Italy from city to city, riding on  a donkey. He preached in churches, on the streets,--wherever he  could secure an audience.    When Peter had gone over Italy he crossed the Alps and preached to  the people of France, Germany, and neighboring countries. Everywhere  he kindled the zeal of the people, and multitudes enlisted as champions  of the cross.    Thus began the first of seven wars known as the \"Crusades\" or \"Wars  of the Cross,\" waged to rescue the Holy Land from the Mohammedans.    It is said that more than 100,000 men, women and children went  on the first Crusade. Each wore on the right shoulder the emblem  of the cross.    [Illustration: PETER THE HERMIT PREACHING THE FIRST CRUSADE]    Peter was in command of one portion of this great multitude. His  followers began their journey with shouts of joy and praise.    But they had no proper supply of provisions. So when passing through  Hungary they plundered the towns and compelled the inhabitants to  support them. This roused the anger of the Hungarians. They attacked  the Crusaders and killed a great many of them.    After long delays about seven thousand of those who had started on  the Crusade reached Constantinople. They were still enthusiastic  and sounded their war-cry, \"God wills it!\" with as much fervor as  when they first joined Peter's standard.    Leaving Constantinople, they went eastward into the land of the  Turks. A powerful army led by the sultan met them. The Crusaders  fought heroically all day long but at length were badly beaten.  Only a few escaped and found their way back to Constantinople.    Peter the Hermit had left the Crusaders before the battle and returned  to Constantinople. He afterwards joined the army of Godfrey of  Bouillon.    Godfrey's army was composed of six divisions, each commanded by  a soldier of high rank and distinction. It was a well organized  and disciplined force and numbered about half a million men.    It started only a few weeks after the irregular multitude which  followed Peter the Hermit, and was really the first Crusading army,  for Peter's undisciplined"]]]
