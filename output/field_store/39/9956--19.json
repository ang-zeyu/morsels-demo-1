What does that mean?\"    \"Most of the people in the world are poor,\" said the coachman. \"Their  lives are spent in toiling for the rich. Their joys are few; their  sorrows are many.\"    \"And is this the great, beautiful, happy world that I have been told  about?\" cried the prince. \"How weak and foolish I have been to live  in idleness and ease while there is so much sadness and trouble around  me. Turn the carriage quickly, coachman, and drive home. Henceforth,  I will never again seek my own pleasure. I will spend all my life, and  give all that I have, to lessen the distress and sorrow with which  this world seems filled.\"    This the prince did. One night he left the beautiful palace which his  father had given to him and went out into the world to do good and to  help his fellow men. And to this day, millions of people remember and  honor the name of Gautama, as that of the great lover of men.          THE CHARCOAL MAN AND THE KING        There once lived in Paris a poor charcoal man whose name was Jacquot.  [Footnote: _pro._ zhak ko'] His house was small, with only one room in  it; but it was large enough for Jacquot and his wife and their two  little boys.    At one end of the room there was a big fireplace, where the mother did  the cooking. At the other end were the beds. And in the middle was a  rough table with benches around it instead of chairs.    Jacquot's business was to sell charcoal to the rich people in the city.  He might be seen every day with a bag of charcoal on his back, carrying  it to some of his customers. Sometimes he carried three or four bags  to the palace where the little king of France lived with his mother.    One evening he was very late coming home. The table was spread and  supper was ready. The children were hungry and could hardly wait for  their father to come.    \"The supper will get cold,\" said Charlot,[Footnote: _pro._ shar lo']  the eldest.    \"I wonder why he is so late,\" said his little brother,  Blondel.[Footnote: Blon del'.]    \"There is to be a great feast at the queen's palace to-night,\" said  the mother.\" There will be music and dancing, and many fine people  will be there. Perhaps your father is waiting to help in the kitchen.\"    The next minute they heard his voice at the door: \"Be quick, boys, and  stir the fire. Throw on some chips and make a blaze.\"    They did so, and as the flames lighted up the room, they saw their  father enter with a child in his arms.    \"What's the matter?\" cried the mother. \"Who is that child?\"    Then she saw that the child's face was very pale and that he neither  opened his eyes nor moved.    \"Oh, what has happened? Where did you find him?\"    \"I'll tell you all about it,\" answered Jacquot. \"But first get a  blanket and warm it, quick. That on the children's bed is best.\"    \"What a beautiful child!\" said the mother, as she hurried to do his  bidding. The two boys, Charlot and Blondel, with wondering eyes watched  their father and mother undress the little stranger. His beautiful  clothes were soaked with water, and his fine white collar and ruffles  were soiled and dripping.    \"He must have some dry clothes. Bring me your Sunday suit, Charlot.\"    \"Here it is, mother.\" said Charlot.    Soon the little stranger was clad in the warm clothes; the dry soft  blanket was wrapped around him; and he was laid on the children's bed.    Then, being very comfortable, he began to grow stronger. The color  came back to his cheeks. He opened his eyes and looked around at the  small, plain room and at the poor people standing near him.    \"Where am I? Where am I?\" he asked.    \"In my house, my little friend,\" answered Jacquot.    \"_My little friend!_\" said the child with a sneer.    He looked at the fire on the hearth, and at the rough table and  benches. Then he said, \"Your house is a very poor place, I think.\"    \"I am sorry if you do not like it,\" said Jacquot. \"But if I had not  helped you, you would have been in a worse place.\"    \"How did these clothes come on me?\" cried the child. \"They are not  mine. You have stolen my clothes and have given me these ugly things.\"    \"Stolen!\" said the charcoal man, angrily. \"What do you mean, you  ungrateful little rascal?\"    \"Hush, Jacquot,\" said his wife, kindly. \"He doesn't know what he says.  Wait till he rests a while, and then he'll be in a better humor.\"    The child was indeed very tired. His eyes closed and he was soon fast  asleep.    \"Now tell us, father,\" whispered Charlot, \"where did you find him?\"    The charcoal man sat down by the fire. The two boys stood at his knees,  and his wife sat at his side.    \"I will tell you,\" he said. \"I had carried some charcoal to the queen's  kitchen and was just starting home. I took the shortest way through  the little park behind the palace. You know where the fountain is?\"    \"Yes, yes!\" said Blondel. \"It is quite near the park gate.\"    \"Well, as I was hurrying along, I heard a great splash, as though  something had fallen into the pool by the fountain. I looked and saw  this little fellow struggling in the water. I ran and pulled him out.  He was almost drowned.\"    \"Did he say anything, father?\" asked Charlot.    \"Oh, no! He was senseless; but I knew he wasn't drowned. I thought of  the big fire in the queen's kitchen, and knew that the cook would never  allow a half-drowned child to be carried into that fine place. Then  I thought of our own warm little house, and how snug we could make him  until he came to his senses again. So I took him in my arms and ran  home as fast as I could.\"    \"The poor, dear child!\" said Mrs. Jacquot. \"I wonder who he is.\"    \"He shall be our little brother,\" said Blondel; and both the boys  clapped their hands very softly.    In a little while the child awoke. He seemed to feel quite well and  strong. He sat up in the bed and looked around.    \"You want your mother, don't you?\" said Mrs. Jacquot. \"She must be  very uneasy about you. Tell us who she is, and we will carry you to  her.\" \"There is no hurry about that,\" said the child.    \"But they will be looking for you.\"    \"So much the better, let them look. My mother will not be worried. She  has other things to do, and no time to attend to me.\"    \"What! Your own mother, and no time to attend to her child?\"    \"Yes, madam. But she has servants to attend to me.\"  \"Servants! Yes,  I think so,\" said Jacquot. \"They let you fall into the water, and you  would have been drowned, if it hadn't been for me. But come, children,  let us have our supper.\"    They sat down at the table. The mother gave each a tin plate and a  wooden spoon, and then helped them all to boiled beans. The father cut  slices from a loaf of brown bread.    The little stranger came and sat with them. But he would not eat  anything.    \"You must tell us who your mother is,\" said Mrs. Jacquot. \"We must let  her know that you are safe.\"    \"Of course she will be glad to know that,\" said the boy; \"but she has  no time to bother about me to-night.\"    \"Is she like our mother?\" asked Chariot.    \"She is handsomer.\"    \"But ours is better. She is always doing something for us,\" said  Blondel.    \"Mine gives me fine clothes and plenty of money to spend,\" said the  stranger.    \"Ours gives us kisses,\" said Charlot.    \"Ha! that's nothing. Mine makes the servants wait on me and do as I  tell them.\"    \"But our dear mother waits on us herself.\"    The charcoal man and his wife listened to this little dispute, and  said nothing. They were just rising from the table when they heard a  great noise in the street. Then there was a knock at the door.    Before Mrs. Jacquot could open it, some one called out, \"Is this the  house of Jacquot, the charcoal man?\"    \"That is my tutor,\" whispered the little stranger. \"He has come after  me.\" Then he slipped quickly under the table and hid himself. \"Don't  tell him I am here,\" he said softly.    In a few minutes the room was filled with gentlemen. They were all  dressed very finely, and some of them carried swords.    A tall man who wore a long red cloak seemed to be the leader of the  company. He said to a soldier who stood at the door, \"Tell your story  again.\"    \"Well,\" said the soldier, \"about two hours ago I was on guard at the  gate of the queen's park. This charcoal man, whom I know very well,  ran past me with a child in his arms. I did not--\"    \"That will do, sir,\" said the man in red. \"Now, you charcoal man, where  is that child?\"    \"Here!\" cried the child himself, darting out from his hiding place.    [Illustration]    \"O your Majesty!\" said the man in red. \"All your court has been looking  for you for the past two hours.\"    \"I am glad to hear it, Cardinal Mazarin,\" [Footnote: Maz a reen'.]  said the boy.    \"Your mother is very anxious.\"    \"I am sorry if I have given her trouble. But really, I fell into the  pool at the fountain, and this kind man brought me here to get me dry.\"    \"Indeed!\" said the cardinal. \"But I hope you are now ready to come  home with us.\"    \"I shall go when I please.\"    \"Your mother--\"    \"Oh, yes, I know she is anxious, and I will go. But first I must thank  these poor people.\"    \"Please do so, your Majesty.\"    The boy turned toward the charcoal man and said:--\"My friend, I am  the king of France. My name is Louis the Fourteenth. I thank you for  what you have done for me. You shall have money to buy a larger house  and to send your boys to school. Here is my hand to kiss.\" Then he  turned to the cardinal and said, \"Now, I am ready. Let us go.\"    Not dressed in that way?\" said the cardinal. He had just noticed that  the king was wearing poor Charlot's Sunday suit instead of his own.    \"Why not?\" answered the little king.    \"Think what your mother would say if she saw you in the clothes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/62"],[0,"A Princess of Mars (#16)"],[1,"  become mine.  At my direction they placed the stuff in one of the back  rooms, and then departed, only to return with a second load, which they  advised me constituted the balance of my goods.  On the second trip  they were accompanied by ten or fifteen other women and youths, who, it  seemed, formed the retinues of the two chieftains.    They were not their families, nor their wives, nor their servants; the  relationship was peculiar, and so unlike anything known to us that it  is most difficult to describe.  All property among the green Martians  is owned in common by the community, except the personal weapons,  ornaments and sleeping silks and furs of the individuals.  These alone  can one claim undisputed right to, nor may he accumulate more of these  than are required for his actual needs.  The surplus he holds merely as  custodian, and it is passed on to the younger members of the community  as necessity demands.    The women and children of a man's retinue may be likened to a military  unit for which he is responsible in various ways, as in matters of  instruction, discipline, sustenance, and the exigencies of their  continual roamings and their unending strife with other communities and  with the red Martians.  His women are in no sense wives.  The green  Martians use no word corresponding in meaning with this earthly word.  Their mating is a matter of community interest solely, and is directed  without reference to natural selection.  The council of chieftains of  each community control the matter as surely as the owner of a Kentucky  racing stud directs the scientific breeding of his stock for the  improvement of the whole.    In theory it may sound well, as is often the case with theories, but  the results of ages of this unnatural practice, coupled with the  community interest in the offspring being held paramount to that of the  mother, is shown in the cold, cruel creatures, and their gloomy,  loveless, mirthless existence.    It is true that the green Martians are absolutely virtuous, both men  and women, with the exception of such degenerates as Tal Hajus; but  better far a finer balance of human characteristics even at the expense  of a slight and occasional loss of chastity.    Finding that I must assume responsibility for these creatures, whether  I would or not, I made the best of it and directed them to find  quarters on the upper floors, leaving the third floor to me.  One of  the girls I charged with the duties of my simple cuisine, and directed  the others to take up the various activities which had formerly  constituted their vocations.  Thereafter I saw little of them, nor did  I care to.          CHAPTER XIII    LOVE-MAKING ON MARS      Following the battle with the air ships, the community remained within  the city for several days, abandoning the homeward march until they  could feel reasonably assured that the ships would not return; for to  be caught on the open plains with a cavalcade of chariots and children  was far from the desire of even so warlike a people as the green  Martians.    During our period of inactivity, Tars Tarkas had instructed me in many  of the customs and arts of war familiar to the Tharks, including  lessons in riding and guiding the great beasts which bore the warriors.  These creatures, which are known as thoats, are as dangerous and  vicious as their masters, but when once subdued are sufficiently  tractable for the purposes of the green Martians.    Two of these animals had fallen to me from the warriors whose metal I  wore, and in a short time I could handle them quite as well as the  native warriors.  The method was not at all complicated.  If the thoats  did not respond with sufficient celerity to the telepathic instructions  of their riders they were dealt a terrific blow between the ears with  the butt of a pistol, and if they showed fight this treatment was  continued until the brutes either were subdued, or had unseated their  riders.    In the latter case it became a life and death struggle between the man  and the beast.  If the former were quick enough with his pistol he  might live to ride again, though upon some other beast; if not, his  torn and mangled body was gathered up by his women and burned in  accordance with Tharkian custom.    My experience with Woola determined me to attempt the experiment of  kindness in my treatment of my thoats.  First I taught them that they  could not unseat me, and even rapped them sharply between the ears to  impress upon them my authority and mastery.  Then, by degrees, I won  their confidence in much the same manner as I had adopted countless  times with my many mundane mounts.  I was ever a good hand with  animals, and by inclination, as well as because it brought more lasting  and satisfactory results, I was always kind and humane in my dealings  with the lower orders.  I could take a human life, if necessary, with  far less compunction than that of a poor, unreasoning, irresponsible  brute.    In the course of a few days my thoats were the wonder of the entire  community.  They would follow me like dogs, rubbing their great snouts  against my body in awkward evidence of affection, and respond to my  every command with an alacrity and docility which caused the Martian  warriors to ascribe to me the possession of some earthly power unknown  on Mars.    \"How have you bewitched them?\" asked Tars Tarkas one afternoon, when he  had seen me run my arm far between the great jaws of one of my thoats  which had wedged a piece of stone between two of his teeth while  feeding upon the moss-like vegetation within our court yard.    \"By kindness,\" I replied.  \"You see, Tars Tarkas, the softer sentiments  have their value, even to a warrior.  In the height of battle as well  as upon the march I know that my thoats will obey my every command, and  therefore my fighting efficiency is enhanced, and I am a better warrior  for the reason that I am a kind master.  Your other warriors would find  it to the advantage of themselves as well as of the community to adopt  my methods in this respect.  Only a few days since you, yourself, told  me that these great brutes, by the uncertainty of their tempers, often  were the means of turning victory into defeat, since, at a crucial  moment, they might elect to unseat and rend their riders.\"    \"Show me how you accomplish these results,\" was Tars Tarkas' only  rejoinder.    And so I explained as carefully as I could the entire method of  training I had adopted with my beasts, and later he had me repeat it  before Lorquas Ptomel and the assembled warriors.  That moment marked  the beginning of a new existence for the poor thoats, and before I left  the community of Lorquas Ptomel I had the satisfaction of observing a  regiment of as tractable and docile mounts as one might care to see.  The effect on the precision and celerity of the military movements was  so remarkable that Lorquas Ptomel presented me with a massive anklet of  gold from his own leg, as a sign of his appreciation of my service to  the horde.    On the seventh day following the battle with the air craft we again  took up the march toward Thark, all probability of another attack being  deemed remote by Lorquas Ptomel.    During the days just preceding our departure I had seen but little of  Dejah Thoris, as I had been kept very busy by Tars Tarkas with my  lessons in the art of Martian warfare, as well as in the training of my  thoats.  The few times I had visited her quarters she had been absent,  walking upon the streets with Sola, or investigating the buildings in  the near vicinity of the plaza.  I had warned them against venturing  far from the plaza for fear of the great white apes, whose ferocity I  was only too well acquainted with.  However, since Woola accompanied  them on all their excursions, and as Sola was well armed, there was  comparatively little cause for fear.    On the evening before our departure I saw them approaching along one of  the great avenues which lead into the plaza from the east.  I advanced  to meet them, and telling Sola that I would take the responsibility for  Dejah Thoris' safekeeping, I directed her to return to her quarters on  some trivial errand.  I liked and trusted Sola, but for some reason I  desired to be alone with Dejah Thoris, who represented to me all that I  had left behind upon Earth in agreeable and congenial companionship.  There seemed bonds of mutual interest between us as powerful as though  we had been born under the same roof rather than upon different  planets, hurtling through space some forty-eight million miles apart.    That she shared my sentiments in this respect I was positive, for on my  approach the look of pitiful hopelessness left her sweet countenance to  be replaced by a smile of joyful welcome, as she placed her little  right hand upon my left shoulder in true red Martian salute.    \"Sarkoja told Sola that you had become a true Thark,\" she said, \"and  that I would now see no more of you than of any of the other warriors.\"    \"Sarkoja is a liar of the first magnitude,\" I replied, \"notwithstanding  the proud claim of the Tharks to absolute verity.\"    Dejah Thoris laughed.    \"I knew that even though you became a member of the community you would  not cease to be my friend; 'A warrior may change his metal, but not his  heart,' as the saying is upon Barsoom.\"    \"I think they have been trying to keep us apart,\" she continued, \"for  whenever you have been off duty one of the older women of Tars Tarkas'  retinue has always arranged to trump up some excuse to get Sola and me  out of sight.  They have had me down in the pits below the buildings  helping them mix their awful radium powder, and make their terrible  projectiles.  You know that these have to be manufactured by artificial  light, as exposure to sunlight always results in an explosion.  You  have noticed that their bullets explode when they strike an object?
