How great, indeed, must have been  the perplexity of any grazier who, being the owner, for instance, of  forty head of cattle, and having seen ten of them perish under his eyes,  without knowing where to dispose of them, was threatened with the loss  of the remaining thirty within a few days! How could he calmly and  patiently resign himself to suffer so large a quantity of animal matter  to accumulate and putrefy around him, when, suddenly ruined, and  destitute of every resource, the authorities held back instead of coming  to his assistance.    The prime cause of all the transgressions committed in despite of the  Privy Council's orders, may therefore be referred in part to the want  of compensation to be granted to the owners of infected cattle. It all  might be almost reduced to a question of money. For let us suppose for a  moment, that inspectors entrusted with adequate powers, had been  authorized, after a close examination, to point out the tainted cattle;  to fix a moderate price on them by way of compensation; to have them  slaughtered, carried away, and immediately buried, would not such a  course have diminished the generation of contagious miasma in a  considerable proportion?    Moreover, some cattle-breeders and farmers exposed themselves to the  imposition of fines and penalties without any evil designs; for when  they drove their beasts to market they were only in the stage of  incubation, at the preliminary period, when it is really no easy task to  distinguish the distemper. The following fact will exemplify this.    At each market, in spite of continual warnings, the inspectors pick out  and despatch to the slaughter-houses a certain number of sick cattle,  not only those affected with typhus, but with other disorders. One  cannot help wondering, on seeing the poor, lean, sickly condition of  some of these creatures, how their owners could have been so mad as to  expose them for sale; but in their number there are a few which,  although sick, appear in good health to the common observer.    About a fortnight ago, during one of our visits to the great  Metropolitan Market, Mr. Tegg, the veterinary inspector, whose  intelligence and earnestness are quite equal to the very difficult  charge with which he is entrusted, ordered to be seized and removed to a  secluded fold near the slaughter-houses, a dozen diseased animals. When  once these cattle had been thus collected in a body, it was easy to  submit them to a still closer examination. Most of these beasts, adult  cows and oxen, were lean, panting, feverish, dispirited, and remained  motionless where they stood. But among them was a cow, with a brisk and  lively look, a quick open eye, which watched us with anxiety, and fled  at our approach every time we passed by her. The turn came for this cow  to be examined. Mr. Tegg, strong and handy--as every good veterinary  doctor should be--seized hold of one of her horns, but he was quickly  shaken off; other persons came up to assist him; the fiery animal was  suddenly seized by both horns, by the nostrils, and the tail; but so  strong and spirited was the animal, that she defended herself with  advantage against all her adversaries, and once more shook herself free.    It was necessary, however, to master the creature, so they surrounded  her again, pressing her back this time into a corner of the pen, to  overpower her. But lo! the animal takes a sudden spring, and leaps over  the bars. Assuredly this cow, for a beast suspected of the typhus taint,  had given a proof, if not of health, at least of extraordinary vigour;  and her owner, who had seen her condemned with much vexation, now  thought he saw ample reason to reclaim her, and drive her back to the  market for sale. However the cow, on taking such a leap, and under  conditions so unfavourable, came down with all her weight upon her  limbs, fracturing one of her forelegs.    After this accident, we were able to prosecute the examination we  desired, and Mr. Tegg showed us a row of little glandular swellings on  the ridge of the gums, and livid spots on the vaginal mucous membrane,  which confirmed his diagnosis. The owner of this cow, nevertheless,  still discredited the diseased state of the beast; so to convince him,  she was driven off at once to the slaughter-house to be struck down;  but, unfortunately, three or four others filled the required area, so  that the poor cow was forced to witness the execution of her  fellow-creatures before being killed herself. The look and posture of  this cow, her excited yet terrified glance as she surveyed this scene of  carnage, was one of those pictures which no pencil could draw; and  although we acknowledge that man possesses an incontestable right to  apply to his own use the dead or live matter of animals for his food and  sustenance, we could not help feeling for the poor victim, slipping over  the blood, and thus scenting death before receiving the stroke.    We are not excessively sensitive; we have seen a hundred horses bleeding  from the incisions made by veterinary pupils, and scores of oxen  slaughtered; we ourselves have practised numerous experiments on  animals; but the affecting sight of that animal witnessing the slaughter  of others, and waiting her turn to die, touched us deeply. We could not  help asking ourselves, how it was that man could dispense with  compassion and good feeling even in that bloody toil, and why he did not  bandage the eyes of the doomed creatures he was going to sacrifice?  These dumb animals that we treat like inert matter are sensitive like  ourselves; they are very conscious of pain; and if it be our privilege  to compute the number of our days, we ought not to forget that they are,  like us, endowed with intelligence, so that when they are thus detained  at the place of execution, all their senses and faculties being  concentrated on their destroyer, they are fully conscious of the cruel  fate which awaits them.    At last it was the poor beast's turn to be slaughtered, and ten minutes  afterwards we opened her entrails, and had proof that Mr. Tegg's  judgment was exact, for already the stomach and intestines offered to  view indubitable signs of the typhus at its first period.    The owner of the cow was then convinced and brought to reason, but he  still very fairly asserted the goodness of his motives, about which none  present doubted at all, and applied for compensation to the full value  of the beast, both as butcher's meat and offal, which application was  granted.    Judge, therefore, by this particular example, how many tainted cattle  there must have been which have propagated this distemper, some with and  some without the knowledge of their owners; and, \"_horresco referens!_\"  how much of this tainted meat must have been purchased and eaten by the  public, since this cow had all the appearance of health and vigour, and  the real diseased condition might not have been detected at all, but for  the experience and sagacity of Mr. Tegg, the inspector.      VI.    In this consideration of the causes of the contagious typhus in bovine  cattle, we have deemed it essential to invite attention both to those  which are generally recognised and admitted, and to those which, though  they may have been settled in the minds of observant and experienced  men, may yet appear hypothetical to certain readers.    Besides which, in every scientific work, allowance must be made for the  past and future; and here we have two vital distinctions. If the man  who undertakes this task does not go on, he falls back; and it was to  avoid incurring this reproach that we have passed our old boundaries and  visited new avenues. We are aware that more than one objection might be  urged against the opinions and theories which we have exposed, in order  to account for the outbreak of typhus in England; we might anticipate,  we might reply to these objections; but we would rather recapitulate our  inquiry into the causes, in the tangible form of practical propositions.    From the general considerations above given, we think we may conclude,    1st. That the causes which generate the cattle typhus on our globe are  permanent and unceasing, not only on the banks of the great rivers which  empty themselves into the Black Sea, but also in other countries--in  America, in Africa, &c.; wherever, in a word, exist the conditions, not  of race (the race of the animal in this case being but secondary), but  of climate and of the organic elements which are indispensable to the  formation and development of typhic miasma.    2nd. That the cattle typhus, although it exists not necessarily, but  through the improvidence or want of caution in man, on different parts  of the earth, never appears at all in the temperate and more genial  zones, save under particular and special circumstances, analogous in  some degree with those which generate the human typhus--inclemency of  the seasons, overcrowded dwellings, bad or insufficient food, and want  of cleanliness; and that these particular and special circumstances give  birth to the epizootic genus, rendering the cattle fit and apt to  receive the germs of the contagious virus, and to foster its incubation.    3rd. That the cattle typhus, thus accidentally developed in the  temperate and genial zones, by means of the vicious hygienic conditions  amidst which horned cattle are accustomed to live, and which serve as  the causes of its propagation, is afterwards transmitted by the contact  of animals living in the same stall or shed, or collected in herds on  the same ground, or transported in the same vehicles, by land or sea.    4th. That the droppings of animals, their litter, their dead bodies, and  their detritus, or broken-up remains--also the stables, vehicles, and  implements which have served for their use, and all matters or  substances which have touched them or approached them--are generative  elements of the distemper.    5th."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36504"],[0,"Freshwater Sponges, Hydroids & Polyzoa (#16)"],[1,"wasserschwaemme,\" Zool.
