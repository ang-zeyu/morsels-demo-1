Sweet basil,  of great fragrance, and red flowers, which are kept in the gardens  at that port, and two other kinds of different flowers, also red, are  found. There is another fruit which grows on high trees, and resembles  the pippin in its pleasing smell and savor; a great quantity of ginger  grows wild there, as also of the herb chiquilite, from which indigo  is made. [76] There are agave-trees, abundance of sagia [sago (?)],  [77] and many cocoanuts. Marble is also to be seen, as well as pearl  shells and large snail-shells, like those brought from China. There is  a very copious spring and five or six rivers of small volume. There  we settled close by the spring. The Indians endeavored to prevent  us; but as the arquebus tells at a distance, upon seeing its deadly  effects, their hostility was lukewarm, and they even gave us some of  the things that they possessed. In this matter of procuring provisions,  several cases of not over good treatment happened to the Indians; for  the Indian who was our best friend and lord of that island, Malope  by name, was killed, as well as two or three others, also friendly  to us. No more of all the island than about three leguas about the  camp was explored. The people of this island are black. They have  small single-masted canoes for use about their villages; and some  very large ones to use in the open sea. On Sunday, October eight, the  adelantado had the master-of-camp stabbed. Tomas de Ampuero was also  killed in the same way. Alférez Juan de Buitrago was beheaded; and the  adelantado intended to have two others, friends of the master-of-camp,  killed, but was restrained therefrom at our request. The cause of  this was notorious, for these men tried to induce the adelantado to  leave the land and abandon it. There must have been other reasons  unknown to me; what I saw was much dissoluteness and shamelessness,  and a great deal of improper conduct. On October eighteen, after a  total eclipse of the moon on the seventeenth, the adelantado died;  [78] November two, Don Lorenzo, his brother-in-law, who had succeeded  him as captain-general; the priest Antonio de Serpa, seven or eight  days before; and November eight the vicar, Juan de Espinosa. Disease  was rampant among our men and many died for lack of care, and the  want of an apothecary and doctor. The men begged the governor Doña  Ysabel Barreto to take them out of the country. All agreed to embark,  and by the mercy of God, we left this port on Saturday, the eighteenth  of the said month, and sailed southwest by west toward the island of  San Cristoval or rather in search of it, to see whether we could find  it or the almiranta, in accordance with the governor's orders. For two  days nothing was seen; and at the request of all the men, who cried  out that we were taking them to destruction, she ordered me to steer  from our settlement, located in ten and one-half degrees of latitude,  to Manila. Thence I steered north northwest to avoid meeting islands  on the way, since we were so ill prepared to approach any of them,  with our men so sick that about fifty of them died in the course of  the voyage and about forty there in the island. We continued our course  short of provisions, navigating five degrees south and as many north,  and meeting with many contrary winds and calms. When we reached an  altitude of six long degrees north latitude, we sighted an island,  apparently about twenty-five leguas in circumference, thickly wooded  and inhabited by many people who resembled those of the Ladrones,  and whom we saw coming toward us in canoes. From the southeast  to the north and then to the southwest, it is surrounded by large  reefs. [79] About four leguas west of it are some low islets. There,  although we tried, we failed to find a suitable place to anchor; for  the galliot and frigates which accompanied our ship had disappeared  some days before. [80] From this place we continued the said course  until we reached an altitude of thirteen and three-quarters degrees,  and in the two days that we sailed west in this latitude, we sighted  the islands of Serpana [i.e., Seypan] and Guan in the Ladrones. We  passed between the two and did not anchor there, because we had no  cable for lowering and hauling up the boat. This was the third of the  month of January, one thousand five hundred and ninety-six. On the  fourteenth of the same month we sighted the cape of Espiritu Sancto,  and on the fifteenth we anchored in the bay of Cobos. [81] We reached  there in such a state that only the goodness of God could have taken  us thither; for human strength and resources would hardly have taken  us a tenth of the way. We reached that place so dismantled and the  crew so weak that we were a most piteous sight, and with only nine  or ten jars of water. In this bay of Cobos the ship was repaired and  the men recuperated as much as possible. On Tuesday, February second,  we left the above port and bay, and on the tenth of the same month  we anchored in the port of Cabite, etc.    Besides my desire to serve your Grace, I am moved to leave this brief  relation for you, by the fact that if, perchance, God should dispose of  my life, or other events should cause me or the relation that I carry  to disappear, the truth may be learned from this one, which may prove  a matter of great service to God and to the king our sovereign. [82]  Will your Grace look favorably upon my great desire to serve you,  of which I shall give a better proof, if God permit me to return to  this port. Will your Grace also pardon my brevity, since the fault  lies in the short time at my present disposal. Moreover, since no man  knows what time may bring, I beg your Grace to keep the matter secret,  for on considering it well, it seems only right that nothing be said  about the first islands until his Majesty be informed and order what  is convenient to his service, for, as the islands occupy a position  midway between Peru, Nueva Españia, and this land, the English,  on learning of them, might settle them and do much mischief in this  sea. Your Grace, I consider myself as the faithful servant of your  Grace. May God our Lord preserve you for many years in great joy and  increasing prosperity, etc. Your Grace's servant, PEDRO FERNANDEZ DE  QUIROS To Doctor Antonio de Morga, lieutenant-governor of his Majesty  in the Filipinas.     When Governor Don Francisco Tello entered upon his office, in the  year ninety-six, he found the \"San Geronymo,\" the ship in which Don  Fernando de Castro and his wife Doña Ysabel Barreto were returning  to Nueva España, preparing for the voyage in the port of Cabite. He  also found there the galleon \"San Felipe\" laden with Filipinas goods,  preparing to make its voyage to Nueva España. As soon as Governor  Don Francisco Tello entered upon his administration, both ships were  despatched and set sail. Although the \"San Geronymo\" sailed last,  it made the voyage, reaching Nueva Españia at the end of the said  year of ninety-six. The vessel \"San Felipe,\" which was a large ship  and heavily laden with merchandise and passengers, and whose commander  and general was Don Mathia de Landecho, encountered many storms on the  voyage, so that at one time it became necessary to throw considerable  cargo overboard, and they lost their rudder while in thirty-seven  degrees of latitude, six hundred leguas from the Filipinas, and a  hundred and fifty from Xapon. Seeing themselves unable to continue  their voyage, it was decided to put back to the Filipinas. They set  about this and changed their course, but experienced even greater  difficulties and trials. Many times they gave themselves up as lost,  for the seas ran high, and as the vessel had no rudder, the rigging  and few sails were carried away, and blown into shreds. They could not  hold the vessel to its course, and it worked so often to windward that  they were in great danger of foundering, and lost all hope of reaching  the Filipinas. Xapon was the nearest place, but not sufficiently near  to enable them to reach it or to venture near its coast which is very  wild, and unknown to them even by sight; and even should they have the  good fortune to reach it, they did not know how the Japanese would  receive them. At this juncture arose confusion and a diversity of  opinion among the men aboard. Some said that they should not abandon  the course to Manila, in spite of the great peril and discomfort that  they were experiencing. Others said that it would be a rash act to do  so, and that, since Xapon was much nearer, they should make for it,  and look for the port of Nangasaqui, between which and the Filipinas  trade was carried on. There they would be well received and would find  means to repair their ships, and of resuming the voyage thence. This  opinion prevailed, for some religious in the ship adopted it, and the  rest coincided with them, on the assurance of the pilots that they  would quickly take the ship to Xapon. Accordingly they altered their  course for that country, and after six days sighted the coast and  country of Xapon, at a province called Toça; [83] and although they  tried by day to reach the land, at night, when they lowered the sails,  the tide carried them away from it. Many funeas [84] came to the ship  from a port called Hurando, and the Spaniards, persuaded by the king  of that province, who assured them of harbor, tackle, and repairs,  entered the port, after having sounded and examined the entrance, and  whether the water was deep enough.

And besides, that habit of  minute and troublesome accuracy leads to a mercantile manner of doing  business, which ought to be beneath a landed proprietor whose family has  stood two or three generations. I question if there's a dealer's clerk  in Fairport that can sum an account of interest better than Monkbarns.\"    \"But you'll accept his invitation, sir?\"    \"Why, ye--yes; we have no other engagement on hand, I think. Who can the  young man be he talks of?--he seldom picks up new acquaintance; and he  has no relation that I ever heard of.\"    \"Probably some relation of his brother-in-law Captain M'Intyre.\"    \"Very possibly--yes, we will accept--the M'Intyres are of a very ancient  Highland family. You may answer his card in the affirmative, Isabella; I  believe I have, no leisure to be Dear Sirring myself.\"    So this important matter being adjusted, Miss Wardour intimated \"her  own and Sir Arthur's compliments, and that they would have the honour of  waiting upon Mr. Oldbuck. Miss Wardour takes this opportunity to renew  her hostility with Mr. Oldbuck, on account of his late long absence from  Knockwinnock, where his visits give so much pleasure.\" With this placebo  she concluded her note, with which old Caxon, now refreshed in limbs and  wind, set out on his return to the Antiquary's mansion.          CHAPTER SIXTH.                       Moth. By Woden, God of Saxons,              From whence comes Wensday, that is, Wodnesday,                     Truth is a thing that I will ever keep                     Unto thylke day in which I creep into                               My sepulcre--                               Cartwright's Ordinary.    Our young friend Lovel, who had received a corresponding invitation,  punctual to the hour of appointment, arrived at Monkbarns about five  minutes before four o'clock on the 17th of July. The day had been  remarkably sultry, and large drops of rain had occasionally fallen,  though the threatened showers had as yet passed away.    Mr. Oldbuck received him at the Palmer's-port in his complete brown  suit, grey silk stockings, and wig powdered with all the skill of the  veteran Caxon, who having smelt out the dinner, had taken care not to  finish his job till the hour of eating approached.    \"You are welcome to my symposion, Mr. Lovel. And now let me introduce  you to my Clogdogdo's, as Tom Otter calls them--my unlucky and  good-for-nothing womankind--malae bestiae, Mr. Lovel.\"    \"I shall be disappointed, sir, if I do not find the ladies very  undeserving of your satire.\"    \"Tilley-valley, Mr. Lovel,--which, by the way, one commentator derives  from tittivillitium, and another from talley-ho--but tilley-valley, I  say--a truce with your politeness. You will find them but samples of  womankind--But here they be, Mr. Lovel. I present to you in due order, my  most discreet sister Griselda, who disdains the simplicity, as well as  patience annexed to the poor old name of Grizzel; and my most exquisite  niece Maria, whose mother was called Mary, and sometimes Molly.\"    The elderly lady rustled in silks and satins, and bore upon her head a  structure resembling the fashion in the ladies' memorandum-book for the  year 1770--a superb piece of architecture, not much less than a modern  Gothic castle, of which the curls might represent the turrets, the black  pins the chevaux de frise, and the lappets the banners.    The face, which, like that of the ancient statues of Vesta, was thus  crowned with towers, was large and long, and peaked at nose and chin,  and bore, in other respects, such a ludicrous resemblance to the  physiognomy of Mr. Jonathan Oldbuck, that Lovel, had they not appeared  at once, like Sebastian and Viola in the last scene of the \"Twelfth  Night,\" might have supposed that the figure before him was his old  friend masquerading in female attire. An antique flowered silk gown  graced the extraordinary person to whom belonged this unparalleled tete,  which her brother was wont to say was fitter for a turban for Mahound  or Termagant, than a head-gear for a reasonable creature, or Christian  gentlewoman. Two long and bony arms were terminated at the elbows by  triple blond ruffles, and being, folded saltire-ways in front of her  person, and decorated with long gloves of a bright vermilion colour,  presented no bad resemblance to a pair of gigantic lobsters. High-heeled  shoes, and a short silk cloak, thrown in easy negligence over her  shoulders, completed the exterior of Miss Griselda Oldbuck.    Her niece, the same whom Lovel had seen transiently during his first  visit, was a pretty young woman, genteelly dressed according to the  fashion of the day, with an air of espieglerie which became her very  well, and which was perhaps derived from the caustic humour peculiar to  her uncle's family, though softened by transmission.    Mr. Lovel paid his respects to both ladies, and was answered by the  elder with the prolonged courtesy of 1760, drawn from the righteous  period,                           When folks conceived a grace                         Of half an hour's space,                         And rejoiced in a Friday's capon,    and by the younger with a modern reverence, which, like the festive  benediction of a modern divine, was of much shorter duration.    While this salutation was exchanging, Sir Arthur, with his fair daughter  hanging upon his arm, having dismissed his chariot, appeared at the  garden door, and in all due form paid his respects to the ladies.    \"Sir Arthur,\" said the Antiquary, \"and you, my fair foe, let me make  known to you my young friend Mr. Lovel, a gentleman who, during the  scarlet-fever which is epidemic at present in this our island, has the  virtue and decency to appear in a coat of a civil complexion. You see,  however, that the fashionable colour has mustered in his cheeks which  appears not in his garments. Sir Arthur, let me present to you a young  gentleman, whom your farther knowledge will find grave, wise, courtly,  and scholar-like, well seen, deeply read, and thoroughly grounded in all  the hidden mysteries of the green-room and stage, from the days of Davie  Lindsay down to those of Dibdin--he blushes again, which is a sign of  grace.\"    \"My brother,\" said Miss Griselda, addressing Lovel, \"has a humorous way  of expressing himself, sir; nobody thinks anything of what Monkbarns  says--so I beg you will not be so confused for the matter of his  nonsense; but you must have had a warm walk beneath this broiling  sun--would you take anything?--a glass of balm-wine?\"    Ere Lovel could answer, the Antiquary interposed. \"Aroint thee, witch!  wouldst thou poison my guests with thy infernal decoctions? Dost thou  not remember how it fared with the clergyman whom you seduced to partake  of that deceitful beverage?\"    \"O fy, fy, brother!--Sir Arthur, did you ever hear the like?--he must have  everything his ain way, or he will invent such stories--But there goes  Jenny to ring the old bell to tell us that the dinner is ready.\"    Rigid in his economy, Mr. Oldbuck kept no male servant. This he  disguised under the pretext that the masculine sex was too noble to  be employed in those acts of personal servitude, which, in all early  periods of society, were uniformly imposed on the female. \"Why,\"  would he say, \"did the boy, Tam Rintherout, whom, at my wise sister's  instigation, I, with equal wisdom, took upon trial--why did he pilfer  apples, take birds' nests, break glasses, and ultimately steal my  spectacles, except that he felt that noble emulation which swells in the  bosom of the masculine sex, which has conducted him to Flanders with  a musket on his shoulder, and doubtless will promote him to a glorious  halbert, or even to the gallows? And why does this girl, his full  sister, Jenny Rintherout, move in the same vocation with safe and  noiseless step--shod, or unshod--soft as the pace of a cat, and docile as  a spaniel--Why? but because she is in her vocation. Let them minister to  us, Sir Arthur,--let them minister, I say,--it's the only thing they are  fit for. All ancient legislators, from Lycurgus to Mahommed, corruptly  called Mahomet, agree in putting them in their proper and subordinate  rank, and it is only the crazy heads of our old chivalrous ancestors  that erected their Dulcineas into despotic princesses.\"    Miss Wardour protested loudly against this ungallant doctrine; but the  bell now rung for dinner.    \"Let me do all the offices of fair courtesy to so fair an antagonist,\"  said the old gentleman, offering his arm. \"I remember, Miss Wardour,  Mahommed (vulgarly Mahomet) had some hesitation about the mode  of summoning his Moslemah to prayer. He rejected bells as used by  Christians, trumpets as the summons of the Guebres, and finally adopted  the human voice. I have had equal doubt concerning my dinner-call.  Gongs, now in present use, seemed a newfangled and heathenish invention,  and the voice of the female womankind I rejected as equally shrill and  dissonant; wherefore, contrary to the said Mahommed, or Mahomet, I have  resumed the bell. It has a local propriety, since it was the conventual  signal for spreading the repast in their refectory, and it has the  advantage over the tongue of my sister's prime minister, Jenny, that,  though not quite so loud and shrill, it ceases ringing the instant you  drop the bell-rope: whereas we know, by sad experience, that any attempt  to silence Jenny, only wakes the sympathetic chime of Miss Oldbuck and  Mary M'Intyre to join in"]]]
