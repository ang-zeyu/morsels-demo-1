The wounded man had the presence of mind to plunge his dagger in the  side of the wayfarer who preceded him, thus dying, as the people say, in  company. One of these events throws the country into confusion, for the  _vendetta_ is rancorous and bloody, as in ancient Germany or in modern  Corsica. Our Abban enlarged upon the unpleasant necessity of travelling  all night towards the hills, and lying _perdu_ during the day. The most  dangerous times are dawn and evening tide: the troopers spare their horses  during the heat, and themselves during the dew-fall. Whenever, in the  desert,--where, says the proverb, all men are enemies--you sight a fellow  creature from  afar, you wave the right arm violently up and down,  shouting \"War Joga! War Joga!\"--stand still! stand still! If they halt,  you send a parliamentary to within speaking distance. Should they advance  [38], you fire, taking especial care not to miss; when two saddles are  emptied, the rest are sure to decamp.    I had given the Abban orders to be in readiness,--my patience being  thoroughly exhausted,--on Sunday, the 26th of November, and determined to  walk the whole way, rather than waste another day waiting for cattle. As  the case had become hopeless, a vessel was descried standing straight from  Tajurrah, and, suddenly as could happen in the Arabian Nights, four fine  mules, saddled and bridled, Abyssinian fashion, appeared at the door. [39]      FOOTNOTES    [1] Brace describes Zayla as \"a small island, on the very coast of Adel.\"  To reconcile discrepancy, he adopts the usual clumsy expedient of  supposing two cities of the same name, one situated seven degrees south of  the other. Salt corrects the error, but does not seem to have heard of old  Zayla's insular position.    [2] The inhabitants were termed Avalitae, and the Bay \"Sinus Avaliticus.\"  Some modern travellers have confounded it with Adule or Adulis, the port  of Axum, founded by fugitive Egyptian slaves. The latter, however, lies  further north: D'Anville places it at Arkiko, Salt at Zula (or Azule),  near the head of Annesley Bay.    [3] The Arabs were probably the earliest colonists of this coast. Even the  Sawahil people retain a tradition that their forefathers originated in the  south of Arabia.    [4] To the present day the district of Gozi is peopled by Mohammedans  called Arablet, \"whose progenitors,\" according to Harris, \"are said by  tradition to have been left there prior to the reign of Nagasi, first King  of Shoa. Hossain, Wahabit, and Abdool Kurreem, generals probably detached  from the victorious army of Graan (Mohammed Gragne), are represented to  have come from Mecca, and to have taken possession of the country,--the  legend assigning to the first of these warriors as his capital, the  populous village of Medina, which is conspicuous on a cone among the  mountains, shortly after entering the valley of Robi.\"    [5] Historia Regum Islamiticorum in Abyssinia, Lugd. Bat. 1790.    [6] The affinity between the Somal and the Berbers of Northern Africa,  and their descent from Canaan, son of Ham, has been learnedly advanced  and refuted by several Moslem authors. The theory appears to have arisen  from a mistake; Berberah, the great emporium of the Somali country,  being confounded with the Berbers of Nubia.    [7] Probably Zaidi from Yemen. At present the people of Zayla are all  orthodox Sunnites.    [8] Fish, as will be seen in these pages, is no longer a favourite article  of diet.    [9] Bruce, book 8.    [10] Hence the origin of the trade between Africa and Cutch, which  continues uninterrupted to the present time. Adel, Arabia, and India, as  Bruce remarks, were three partners in one trade, who mutually exported  their produce to Europe, Asia, and Africa, at that time the whole known  world.    [11] The Turks, under a show of protecting commerce, established these  posts in their different ports. But they soon made it appear that the end  proposed was only to ascertain who were the subjects from whom they could  levy the most enormous extortions. Jeddah, Zebid, and Mocha, the places of  consequence nearest to Abyssinia on the Arabian coast, Suakin, a seaport  town on the very barriers of Abyssinia, in the immediate way of their  caravan to Cairo on the African side, were each under the command of a  Turkish Pasha and garrisoned by Turkish troops sent thither from  Constantinople by the emperors Selim and Sulayman.    [12] Bartema's account of its productions is as follows: \"The soil beareth  wheat and hath abundance of flesh and divers other commodious things. It  hath also oil, not of olives, but of some other thing, I know not what.  There is also plenty of honey and wax; there are likewise certain sheep  having their tails of the weight of sixteen pounds, and exceeding fat; the  head and neck are black, and all the rest white. There are also sheep  altogether white, and having tails of a cubit long, and hanging down like  a great cluster of grapes, and have also great laps of skin hanging down  from their throats, as have bulls and oxen, hanging down almost to the  ground. There are also certain kind with horns like unto harts' horns;  these are wild, and when they be taken are given to the Sultan of that  city as a kingly present. I saw there also certain kind having only one  horn in the midst of the forehead, as hath the unicorn, and about a span  of length, but the horn bendeth backward: they are of bright shining red  colour. But they that have harts' horns are inclining to black colour.  Living is there good and cheap.\"    [13] The people have a tradition that a well of sweet water exists unseen  in some part of the island. When Saad el Din was besieged in Zayla by the  Hatze David, the host of El Islam suffered severely for the want of the  fresh element.    [14] The singular is Dankali, the plural Danakil: both words are Arabic,  the vernacular name being \"Afar\" or \"Afer,\" the Somali \"Afarnimun.\" The  word is pronounced like the Latin \"Afer,\" an African.    [15] Occasionally at Zayla--where all animals are expensive--Dankali  camels may be bought: though small, they resist hardship and fatigue  better than the other kinds. A fair price would be about ten dollars. The  Somal divide their animals into two kinds, Gel Ad and Ayyun. The former is  of white colour, loose and weak, but valuable, I was told by Lieut. Speke,  in districts where little water is found: the Ayyun is darker and  stronger; its price averages about a quarter more than the Gel Ad.    To the Arabian traveller nothing can be more annoying than these Somali  camels. They must be fed four hours during the day, otherwise they cannot  march. They die from change of food or sudden removal to another country.  Their backs are ever being galled, and, with all precautions, a month's  march lays them up for three times that period. They are never used for  riding, except in cases of sickness or accidents.    The Somali ass is generally speaking a miserable animal. Lieut. Speke,  however, reports that on the windward coast it is not to be despised. At  Harar I found a tolerable breed, superior in appearance but inferior in  size to the thoroughbred little animals at Aden. They are never ridden;  their principal duty is that of carrying water-skins to and from the  walls.    [16] He is generally called Abu Zerbin, more rarely Abu Zarbayn, and Abu  Zarbay. I have preferred the latter orthography upon the authority of the  Shaykh Jami, most learned of the Somal.    [17] In the same year (A.D. 1429-30) the Shaykh el Shazili, buried under a  dome at Mocha, introduced coffee into Arabia.    [18] The following is an extract from the Pharmaceutical Journal, vol.  xii. No. v. Nov. 1. 1852. Notes upon the drugs observed at Aden Arabia, by  James Vaughan, Esq., M.R.C.S.E., Assist. Surg., B.A., Civil and Port.  Surg., Aden, Arabia.    \"Kat [Arabic], the name of a drug which is brought into Aden from the  interior, and largely used, especially by the Arabs, as a pleasurable  excitant. It is generally imported in small camel-loads, consisting of a  number of parcels, each containing about forty slender twigs with the  leaves attached, and carefully wrapped so as to prevent as much as  possible exposure to the atmosphere. The leaves form the edible part, and  these, when chewed, are said to produce great hilarity of spirits, and an  agreeable state of wakefulness. Some estimate may be formed of the strong  predilection which the Arabs have for this drug from the quantity used in  Aden alone, which averages about 280 camel-loads annually. The market  price is one and a quarter rupees per parcel, and the exclusive privilege  of selling it is farmed by the government for 1500 rupees per year.  Forskal found the plant growing on the mountains of Yemen, and has  enumerated it as a new genus in the class Pentandria, under the name of  Catha. He notices two species, and distinguishes them as _Catha edulis_  and _Catha spinosa_. According to his account it is cultivated on the same  ground as coffee, and is planted from cuttings. Besides the effects above  stated, the Arabs, he tells us, believe the land where it grows to be  secure from the inroads of plague; and that a twig of the Kat carried in  the bosom is a certain safeguard against infection. The learned botanist  observes, with respect to these supposed virtues, 'Gustus foliorum tamen  virtutem tantam indicare non videtur.' Like coffee, Kat, from its  acknowledged stimulating effects, has been a fertile theme for the  exercise of Mahomedan casuistry, and names of renown are ranged on both  sides of the question, whether the use of Kat does or does not contravene  the injunction of the Koran, Thou shalt not drink wine or anything  intoxicating. The succeeding notes, borrowed chiefly from De Sacy's  researches, may be deemed worthy of insertion here.    \"Sheikh Abdool Kader Ansari Jezeri, a learned Mahomedan"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/689"],[0,"The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories (#16)"],[1,"anner. One would  have said that new sentiments, new virtualities, of which I was formerly  ignorant, had developed in me. 'Ah, yes, that's it! Not at all as I  lived and thought before! This is the right way to live!'    \"Thus I spoke to my soul as I listened to that music. What was this new  thing that I thus learned? That I did not realize, but the consciousness  of this indefinite state filled me with joy. In that state there was no  room for jealousy. The same faces, and among them HE and my wife, I saw  in a different light. This music transported me into an unknown world,  where there was no room for jealousy. Jealousy and the feelings that  provoke it seemed to me trivialities, nor worth thinking of.    \"After the presto followed the andante, not very new, with commonplace  variations, and the feeble finale. Then they played more, at the request  of the guests,--first an elegy by Ernst, and then various other pieces.  They were all very well, but did not produce upon me a tenth part of the  impression that the opening piece did. I felt light and gay throughout  the evening. As for my wife, never had I seen her as she was that night.  Those brilliant eyes, that severity and majestic expression while she  was playing, and then that utter languor, that weak, pitiable, and happy  smile after she had finished,--I saw them all and attached no importance  to them, believing that she felt as I did, that to her, as to me, new  sentiments had been revealed, as through a fog. During almost the whole  evening I was not jealous.    \"Two days later I was to start for the assembly of the Zemstvo, and for  that reason, on taking leave of me and carrying all his scores with him,  Troukhatchevsky asked me when I should return. I inferred from that that  he believed it impossible to come to my house during my absence, and  that was agreeable to me. Now I was not to return before his departure  from the city. So we bade each other a definite farewell. For the  first time I shook his hand with pleasure, and thanked him for the  satisfaction that he had given me. He likewise took leave of my wife,  and their parting seemed to me very natural and proper. All went  marvellously. My wife and I retired, well satisfied with the evening. We  talked of our impressions in a general way, and we were nearer together  and more friendly than we had been for a long time.\"        CHAPTER XXIV.    \"Two days later I started for the assembly, having bid farewell to my  wife in an excellent and tranquil state of mind. In the district there  was always much to be done. It was a world and a life apart. During two  days I spent ten hours at the sessions. The evening of the second day,  on returning to my district lodgings, I found a letter from my wife,  telling me of the children, of their uncle, of the servants, and, among  other things, as if it were perfectly natural, that Troukhatchevsky had  been at the house, and had brought her the promised scores. He had also  proposed that they play again, but she had refused.    \"For my part, I did not remember at all that he had promised any score.  It had seemed to me on Sunday evening that he took a definite leave,  and for this reason the news gave me a disagreeable surprise. I read the  letter again. There was something tender and timid about it. It produced  an extremely painful impression upon me. My heart swelled, and the mad  beast of jealousy began to roar in his lair, and seemed to want to leap  upon his prey. But I was afraid of this beast, and I imposed silence  upon it.    \"What an abominable sentiment is jealousy! 'What could be more natural  than what she has written?' said I to myself. I went to bed, thinking  myself tranquil again. I thought of the business that remained to be  done, and I went to sleep without thinking of her.    \"During these assemblies of the Zemstvo I always slept badly in my  strange quarters. That night I went to sleep directly, but, as sometimes  happens, a sort of sudden shock awoke me. I thought immediately of her,  of my physical love for her, of Troukhatchevsky, and that between them  everything had happened. And a feeling of rage compressed my heart, and  I tried to quiet myself.    \"'How stupid!' said I to myself; 'there is no reason, none at all. And  why humiliate ourselves, herself and myself, and especially myself,  by supposing such horrors? This mercenary violinist, known as a bad  man,--shall I think of him in connection with a respectable woman, the  mother of a family, MY wife? How silly!' But on the other hand, I said  to myself: 'Why should it not happen?'    \"Why? Was it not the same simple and intelligible feeling in the name  of which I married, in the name of which I was living with her, the only  thing I wanted of her, and that which, consequently, others desired,  this musician among the rest? He was not married, was in good health  (I remember how his teeth ground the gristle of the cutlets, and how  eagerly he emptied the glass of wine with his red lips), was careful  of his person, well fed, and not only without principles, but evidently  with the principle that one should take advantage of the pleasure that  offers itself. There was a bond between them, music,--the most refined  form of sensual voluptuousness. What was there to restrain them?  Nothing. Everything, on the contrary, attracted them. And she, she had  been and had remained a mystery. I did not know her. I knew her only  as an animal, and an animal nothing can or should restrain. And now  I remember their faces on Sunday evening, when, after the 'Kreutzer  Sonata,' they played a passionate piece, written I know not by whom, but  a piece passionate to the point of obscenity.    \"'How could I have gone away?' said I to myself, as I recalled their  faces. 'Was it not clear that between them everything was done that  evening? Was it not clear that between them not only there were no more  obstacles, but that both--especially she--felt a certain shame after  what had happened at the piano? How weakly, pitiably, happily she  smiled, as she wiped the perspiration from her reddened face! They  already avoided each other's eyes, and only at the supper, when she  poured some water for him, did they look at each other and smile  imperceptibly.'    \"Now I remember with fright that look and that scarcely perceptible  smile. 'Yes, everything has happened,' a voice said to me, and directly  another said the opposite. 'Are you mad? It is impossible!' said the  second voice.    \"It was too painful to me to remain thus stretched in the darkness.  I struck a match, and the little yellow-papered room frightened me. I  lighted a cigarette, and, as always happens, when one turns in a circle  of inextricable contradiction, I began to smoke. I smoked cigarette  after cigarette to dull my senses, that I might not see my  contradictions. All night I did not sleep, and at five o'clock, when it  was not yet light, I decided that I could stand this strain no longer,  and that I would leave directly. There was a train at eight o'clock. I  awakened the keeper who was acting as my servant, and sent him to look  for horses. To the assembly of Zemstvo I sent a message that I was  called back to Moscow by pressing business, and that I begged them to  substitute for me a member of the Committee. At eight o'clock I got into  a tarantass and started off.\"        CHAPTER XXV.    \"I had to go twenty-five versts by carriage and eight hours by train.  By carriage it was a very pleasant journey. The coolness of autumn was  accompanied by a brilliant sun. You know the weather when the wheels  imprint themselves upon the dirty road. The road was level, and the  light strong, and the air strengthening. The tarantass was comfortable.  As I looked at the horses, the fields, and the people whom we passed,  I forgot where I was going. Sometimes it seemed to me that I was  travelling without an object,--simply promenading,--and that I should  go on thus to the end of the world. And I was happy when I so forgot  myself. But when I remembered where I was going, I said to myself: 'I  shall see later. Don't think about it.'    \"When half way, an incident happened to distract me still further. The  tarantass, though new, broke down, and had to be repaired. The delays in  looking for a telegue, the repairs, the payment, the tea in the inn, the  conversation with the dvornik, all served to amuse me. Toward nightfall  all was ready, and I started off again. By night the journey was still  pleasanter than by day. The moon in its first quarter, a slight frost,  the road still in good condition, the horses, the sprightly coachman,  all served to put me in good spirits. I scarcely thought of what awaited  me, and was gay perhaps because of the very thing that awaited me, and  because I was about to say farewell to the joys of life.    \"But this tranquil state, the power of conquering my preoccupation, all  ended with the carriage drive. Scarcely had I entered the cars, when the  other thing began. Those eight hours on the rail were so terrible to me  that I shall never forget them in my life. Was it because on entering  the car I had a vivid imagination of having already arrived, or because  the railway acts upon people in such an exciting fashion? At any rate,  after boarding the train I could no longer control my imagination, which  incessantly, with extraordinary vivacity, drew pictures before my eyes,  each more cynical than its predecessor, which kindled my jealousy.  And always the same things about what was happening at home during  my absence. I burned with indignation, with rage, and with a peculiar  feeling which steeped me in humiliation, as I contemplated these  pictures. And I could not tear myself out of this condition. I could  not help looking at them, I could not efface them, I could not keep from  evoking them.    \"The more I looked at these imaginary pictures, the more I believed  in their reality, forgetting"]]]
