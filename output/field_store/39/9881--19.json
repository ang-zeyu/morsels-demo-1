Now, one of these very practical  and working mysteries in the Christian tradition, and one which the  Roman Catholic Church, as I say, has done her best work in singling  out, is the conception of the sinfulness of pride. Pride is a weakness  in the character; it dries up laughter, it dries up wonder, it dries up  chivalry and energy. The Christian tradition understands this;  therefore Mr. Moore does not understand the Christian tradition.    For the truth is much stranger even than it appears in the formal  doctrine of the sin of pride.  It is not only true that humility is a  much wiser and more vigorous thing than pride. It is also true that  vanity is a much wiser and more vigorous thing than pride.  Vanity is  social--it is almost a kind of comradeship; pride is solitary and  uncivilized.  Vanity is active; it desires the applause of infinite  multitudes; pride is passive, desiring only the applause of one person,  which it already has. Vanity is humorous, and can enjoy the joke even  of itself; pride is dull, and cannot even smile.  And the whole of this  difference is the difference between Stevenson and Mr. George Moore,  who, as he informs us, has \"brushed Stevenson aside.\"  I do not know  where he has been brushed to, but wherever it is I fancy he is having a  good time, because he had the wisdom to be vain, and not proud.  Stevenson had a windy vanity; Mr. Moore has a dusty egoism. Hence  Stevenson could amuse himself as well as us with his vanity; while the  richest effects of Mr. Moore's absurdity are hidden from his eyes.    If we compare this solemn folly with the happy folly with which  Stevenson belauds his own books and berates his own critics, we shall  not find it difficult to guess why it is that Stevenson at least found  a final philosophy of some sort to live by, while Mr. Moore is always  walking the world looking for a new one. Stevenson had found that the  secret of life lies in laughter and humility. Self is the gorgon.  Vanity sees it in the mirror of other men and lives. Pride studies it  for itself and is turned to stone.    It is necessary to dwell on this defect in Mr. Moore, because it is  really the weakness of work which is not without its strength. Mr.  Moore's egoism is not merely a moral weakness, it is a very constant  and influential aesthetic weakness as well. We should really be much  more interested in Mr. Moore if he were not quite so interested in  himself.  We feel as if we were being shown through a gallery of really  fine pictures, into each of which, by some useless and discordant  convention, the artist had represented the same figure in the same  attitude.  \"The Grand Canal with a distant view of Mr. Moore,\" \"Effect  of Mr. Moore through a Scotch Mist,\" \"Mr. Moore by Firelight,\" \"Ruins  of Mr. Moore by Moonlight,\" and so on, seems to be the endless series.  He would no doubt reply that in such a book as this he intended to  reveal himself. But the answer is that in such a book as this he does  not succeed. One of the thousand objections to the sin of pride lies  precisely in this, that self-consciousness of necessity destroys  self-revelation. A man who thinks a great deal about himself will try  to be many-sided, attempt a theatrical excellence at all points, will  try to be an encyclopaedia of culture, and his own real personality  will be lost in that false universalism. Thinking about himself will  lead to trying to be the universe; trying to be the universe will lead  to ceasing to be anything. If, on the other hand, a man is sensible  enough to think only about the universe; he will think about it in his  own individual way. He will keep virgin the secret of God; he will see  the grass as no other man can see it, and look at a sun that no man has  ever known. This fact is very practically brought out in Mr. Moore's  \"Confessions.\" In reading them we do not feel the presence of a  clean-cut personality like that of Thackeray and Matthew Arnold. We  only read a number of quite clever and largely conflicting opinions  which might be uttered by any clever person, but which we are called  upon to admire specifically, because they are uttered by Mr. Moore. He  is the only thread that connects Catholicism and Protestantism, realism  and mysticism--he or rather his name.  He is profoundly absorbed even  in views he no longer holds, and he expects us to be. And he intrudes  the capital \"I\" even where it need not be intruded--even where it  weakens the force of a plain statement. Where another man would say,  \"It is a fine day,\" Mr. Moore says, \"Seen through my temperament, the  day appeared fine.\" Where another man would say \"Milton has obviously a  fine style,\" Mr. Moore would say, \"As a stylist Milton had always  impressed me.\" The Nemesis of this self-centred spirit is that of being  totally ineffectual.  Mr. Moore has started many interesting crusades,  but he has abandoned them before his disciples could begin. Even when  he is on the side of the truth he is as fickle as the children of  falsehood.  Even when he has found reality he cannot find rest. One  Irish quality he has which no Irishman was ever without--pugnacity; and  that is certainly a great virtue, especially in the present age. But he  has not the tenacity of conviction which goes with the fighting spirit  in a man like Bernard Shaw.  His weakness of introspection and  selfishness in all their glory cannot prevent him fighting; but they  will always prevent him winning.        X. On Sandals and Simplicity    The great misfortune of the modern English is not at all that they are  more boastful than other people (they are not); it is that they are  boastful about those particular things which nobody can boast of  without losing them.  A Frenchman can be proud of being bold and  logical, and still remain bold and logical. A German can be proud of  being reflective and orderly, and still remain reflective and orderly.  But an Englishman cannot be proud of being simple and direct, and still  remain simple and direct. In the matter of these strange virtues, to  know them is to kill them. A man may be conscious of being heroic or  conscious of being divine, but he cannot (in spite of all the  Anglo-Saxon poets) be conscious of being unconscious.    Now, I do not think that it can be honestly denied that some portion of  this impossibility attaches to a class very different in their own  opinion, at least, to the school of Anglo-Saxonism. I mean that school  of the simple life, commonly associated with Tolstoy. If a perpetual  talk about one's own robustness leads to being less robust, it is even  more true that a perpetual talking about one's own simplicity leads to  being less simple. One great complaint, I think, must stand against the  modern upholders of the simple life--the simple life in all its varied  forms, from vegetarianism to the honourable consistency of the  Doukhobors. This complaint against them stands, that they would make us  simple in the unimportant things, but complex in the important things.  They would make us simple in the things that do not matter--that is, in  diet, in costume, in etiquette, in economic system. But they would make  us complex in the things that do matter--in philosophy, in loyalty, in  spiritual acceptance, and spiritual rejection. It does not so very much  matter whether a man eats a grilled tomato or a plain tomato; it does  very much matter whether he eats a plain tomato with a grilled mind.  The only kind of simplicity worth preserving is the simplicity of the  heart, the simplicity which accepts and enjoys. There may be a  reasonable doubt as to what system preserves this; there can surely be  no doubt that a system of simplicity destroys it. There is more  simplicity in the man who eats caviar on impulse than in the man who  eats grape-nuts on principle. The chief error of these people is to be  found in the very phrase to which they are most attached--\"plain living  and high thinking.\" These people do not stand in need of, will not be  improved by, plain living and high thinking.  They stand in need of the  contrary. They would be improved by high living and plain thinking. A  little high living (I say, having a full sense of responsibility, a  little high living) would teach them the force and meaning of the human  festivities, of the banquet that has gone on from the beginning of the  world.  It would teach them the historic fact that the artificial is,  if anything, older than the natural. It would teach them that the  loving-cup is as old as any hunger. It would teach them that ritualism  is older than any religion. And a little plain thinking would teach  them how harsh and fanciful are the mass of their own ethics, how very  civilized and very complicated must be the brain of the Tolstoyan who  really believes it to be evil to love one's country and wicked to  strike a blow.    A man approaches, wearing sandals and simple raiment, a raw tomato held  firmly in his right hand, and says, \"The affections of family and  country alike are hindrances to the fuller development of human love;\"  but the plain thinker will only answer him, with a wonder not untinged  with admiration, \"What a great deal of trouble you must have taken in  order to feel like that.\" High living will reject the tomato.  Plain  thinking will equally decisively reject the idea of the invariable  sinfulness of war. High living will convince us that nothing is more  materialistic than to despise a pleasure as purely material.  And plain  thinking will convince us that nothing is more materialistic than to  reserve our horror chiefly for material wounds.    The only simplicity that matters is the simplicity of the heart. If  that be gone, it can be brought back by no turnips or cellular  clothing; but only by tears and terror and the fires that are not  quenched. If that remain, it matters very little if "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47109"],[0,"Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F. Smith (#16)"],[1,"of this great latter-day work, but there are those who  see in every hour and in every moment of the existence of the Church,  from its beginning until now, the overruling, almighty hand of him who  sent his Only Begotten Son to the world to become a sacrifice for the  sin of the world, that as he was lifted up so he, by reason of his  righteousness and power and the sacrifice which he has made, might lift  up unto God all the children of men who would hearken to his voice,  receive his message, and obey his law.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1904, p. 2.    A PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF GOD. We are not dependent for this upon the  written word, nor upon the knowledge possessed by the ancient prophets  and apostles. We depend only upon God as he reveals himself today and  administers unto men by the power of his Holy Spirit. And all men in  the world, not only the Latter-day Saints, but those who have never  embraced the gospel, have the same privilege that we have, if they will  take the course which God {65} has marked out. It is their privilege to  come to the knowledge of this truth and to understand these things for  themselves. We have derived this knowledge from the Lord, not from man.  Man cannot give this knowledge. I may tell you what I know but that  is not knowledge to you. If I have learned something through prayer,  supplication, and perseverance in seeking to know the truth, and I tell  it to you, it will not be knowledge unto you. I can tell you how you  obtain it, but I cannot give it to you. If we receive this knowledge,  it must come from the Lord. He can touch your understanding and your  spirits, so that you shall comprehend perfectly and not be mistaken.  But I cannot do that. You can obtain this knowledge through repentance,  humility, and seeking the Lord with full purpose of heart until you  find him. He is not afar off. It is not difficult to approach him, if  we will only do it with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, as did  Nephi of old. This was the way in which Joseph Smith, in his boyhood,  approached him. He went into the woods, knelt down, and in humility  he sought earnestly to know which church was acceptable to God. He  received an answer to his prayer which he offered from the depths of  his heart, and he received it in a way that he did not expect.--_Oct.  C. R.,_ 1899, p. 71.    GOD SPEAKS TO THE HONEST IN HEART. Everywhere the Spirit of the Lord  whispers to the honest in heart who are faithful, and gives to them the  assurance that his hand is stretched out continually over his people;  that, as in the past, he has preserved them and delivered them out  of the hands of their enemies, so in the future he will continue to  preserve and deliver them, and he will make the wrath of the wicked to  praise him and to accomplish the more speedily his purposes. We have  every evidence to convince us that the work of the Lord is a reality, a  living, active, progressive work in the earth.--_Oct. C. R.,_ 1905, p.  5.    GOD CONSTANTLY MINDFUL OF US. I desire to express {66} to you, my  brethren and sisters, who are here today, my firm and fixed conviction  that God, the eternal Father, is constantly mindful of you. He is  mindful of his people throughout all this land, and he will reward you  according to your faithfulness in observing the laws of righteousness  and of truth. No man need fear in his heart when he is conscious of  having lived up to the principles of truth and righteousness as God  has required it at his hands, according to his best knowledge and  understanding.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1904, p. 2.    GOD'S WILL TO EXALT MEN. We believe that God's will is to exalt men;  that the liberty that comes through obedience to the gospel of Jesus  Christ is the greatest measure of liberty that can come to man. There  is no liberty that men enjoy or pretend to enjoy in the world that  is not founded in the will and in the law of God, and that does not  have truth for its underlying principle and foundation. It is error  that makes bondsmen. It is untruth that degrades mankind. It is error  and the lack of knowledge of God's laws and God's will that leaves  men in the world on a par with the brute creation; for they have no  higher instincts, no higher principle, no higher incentive, no higher  aspiration, than the brute world, if they have not some inspiration  that comes from a higher source than man himself.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1904,  p. 4.    GOD'S RIGHT TO RULE IN THE WORLD. I believe in God's law. I believe  that it is his right to rule in the world. I believe that no man has  or should have any valid objection in his mind to the government of  God, and the rule of Jesus Christ, in the earth. Let us suppose, for  a moment, that Christ were here and that he was bearing rule in the  world. Who would come under his condemnation? Who would be subject  to his chastening word? Who would be in disharmony or unfellowship  with God? Would the righteous man? Would the virtuous man? The pure  and virtuous woman? The pure and honest in heart? The upright? {67}  The straightforward? Those who do the will of heaven? Would they be  in rebellion to Christ's rule, if he were to come here to rule? No.  They would welcome the rule and reign of Jesus Christ in the earth.  They would welcome his law and acknowledge his sovereignty, they would  hasten to rally to his standard and to uphold the purpose and the  perfection of his laws and of his righteousness. Who would, then, be  recreant to the rule of Christ? The whoremonger, the adulterer, the  liar, the sorcerer, he who bears false witness against his neighbor,  he who seeks to take advantage of his brother, and who would overcome  and destroy him for his own worldly gain or profit; the murderer, the  despiser of that which is good, the unbeliever in the eternities that  lie before us, the atheist, perhaps, although I think that he would  not be so far from Christ as some who profess to be teachers of his  doctrines and advocates of his laws. It would be the rebellious, the  wicked, those who would oppress their neighbors and enslave them if  they could. Such as these would be the people who would not welcome  the reign of Jesus Christ. Are there any who profess to be Latter-day  Saints in this class, and would fear to have Christ reign and  rule?--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1904, p. 4.    THE LESSON IN NATURAL CALAMITIES. There are, in the great world  of mankind, much social and civil unrighteousness, religious  unfaithfulness, and great insensibility to the majesty, power, and  purpose of our eternal Father and God. In order, therefore, that he may  bring the sense of himself and his purposes home to the minds of men,  his intervention and interposition in nature and in men's affairs, are  demanded. His aims will be accomplished even if men must be overwhelmed  with the convulsions of nature to bring them to an understanding and  realization on of his designs. As long as conditions remain as they are  in the world, none is exempt from these visitations.    The Latter-day Saints, though they themselves tremble {68} because  of their own wickedness and sins, believe that great judgments are  coming upon the world because of iniquity; they firmly believe in the  statements of the Holy Scriptures, that calamities will befall the  nations as signs of the coming of Christ to judgment. They believe that  God rules in the fire, the earthquake, the tidal wave, the volcanic  eruption, and the storm. Him they recognize as the Master and Ruler of  nature and her laws, and freely acknowledge his hand in all things. We  believe that his judgments are poured out to bring mankind to a sense  of his power and his purposes, that they may repent of their sins  and prepare themselves for the second coming of Christ to reign in  righteousness upon the earth.    We firmly believe that Zion--which is the pure in heart--shall escape,  if she observes to do all things whatsoever God has commanded; but, in  the opposite event, even Zion shall be visited \"with sore affliction,  with pestilence, with plague, with sword, with vengeance, and with  devouring fire\" (Doctrine and Covenants 97:26). All this that her  people may be taught to walk in the light of truth and in the way of  the God of their salvation.    We believe that these severe, natural calamities are visited upon men  by the Lord for the good of his children, to quicken their devotion to  others, and to bring out their better natures, that they may love and  serve him. We believe, further, that they are the heralds and tokens  of his final judgment, and the schoolmasters to teach the people to  prepare themselves by righteous living for the coming of the Savior  to reign upon the earth, when every knee shall bow and every tongue  confess that Jesus is the Christ.    If these lessons are impressed upon us and upon the people of  our country, the anguish, and the loss of life and toil, sad,  great and horrifying as they were, will not have been endured in  vain.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol. 9, 1905-6, pp. 651-654.    {69} EXTENT OF GOD'S POWER. I do not believe in the doctrine held by  some that God is only a Spirit and that he is of such a nature that  he fills the immensity of space, and is everywhere present in person,  or without person, for I can not conceive it possible that God could  be a person, if he filled the immensity of space and was everywhere  present at the same time. It is unreasonable, a physical, a theological  inconsistency, to imagine that even God the eternal Father would be in  two places, as an individual, at the same moment. It is impossible. But  his power extends throughout the immensity of space. His power extends  to all his creations, and his knowledge comprehends them all, and he  governs them all and he knows all.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1916, p. 4.    BEWARE OF LIMITING GOD. Beware of men who come to you with heresies of  this kind, who would make you to think or feel that the Lord Almighty,  who made heaven and earth "]]]
