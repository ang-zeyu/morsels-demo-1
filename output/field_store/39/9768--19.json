Schuberth of Hamburg has just sent me your transcriptions of the  Schumann songs, which have given me real pleasure. If you publish  other things kindly let me know, for you know the sincere  interest I feel both in yourself and in your works,--an interest  I hope to have the opportunity of showing you more and more.    Meanwhile believe me yours affectionately,    F. Liszt    P.S.--I have not forgotten the little commission you gave me  relative to the \"Fantasie-Stucke,\" and in a few weeks I will let  you have a copy of the new edition.        60. To Robert Schumann    [original in the Royal Library in Berlin]    Dear, esteemed Friend,    Before everything allow me to repeat to you what, next after  myself, you ought properly to have known best a long time ago--  namely, that no one honors and admires you more truly than my  humble self.    When opportunity occurs we can certainly have a friendly  discussion on the importance of a work, a man, even a town  indeed. For the present I am specially rejoicing in the prospect  of an early performance of your opera, and beg you most urgently  to let me know about it a few days beforehand, as I shall most  certainly come to Leipzig on that occasion, and then we can also  arrange for it to be studied in Weymar as soon as possible  afterwards. Perhaps you will also find time there to make me  acquainted with your \"Faust.\" For this composition I am anxiously  waiting, and your resolution to give this work a greater length  and breadth appears to me most judicious. A great subject demands  generally a grand treatment. Although the Vision of Ezekiel  attains in its small dimensions the culminating point of  Raphael's greatness, yet he painted the School of Athens and the  entire frescoes in the Vatican.    \"Manfred\" is glorious, passionately attractive! Don't let  yourself be stopped in it; it will refresh you for your \"Faust\"--  and German art will point with pride to these twin productions.    Schuberth has sent me your \"Album fur die Jugend\" [Album for the  Young], which, to say the least, pleases me much. We have played  your splendid trio here several times, and in a pretty  satisfactory manner.    Wagner stayed some days here and at Eisenach. I am expecting  tidings from him daily from Paris, where he will assuredly  enlarge his reputation and career in a brilliant manner.    Would not your dear wife (to whom I beg to be kindly remembered)  like for once to make a romantic country excursion into the  Thuringer Wald [the Thuringian Forest]? The neighborhood is  charming, and it would give me great pleasure to see her again at  Weymar. A very good grand piano, and two or three intelligent  people who cling to you with true sympathy and esteem, await you  here.    But in any case there will appear in Leipzig as a claqueur  [clapper (to applaud)]    Your unalterably faithful friend,    F. Liszt Weymar, June 5th, 1849        61. To Robert Schumann    [original in the Royal Library in Berlin]    Best thanks, dear friend, for your kind information about the  performance of your \"Faust\" on the 28th of August.    To draw \"das Ewig-Weibliche\" rightly upwards [\"Das Ewig-Weibliche  zicht uns hinan\" (\"The Eternal-Womanly draws us upwards\").--  Goethe's \"Faust\"] by rehearsing the chorus and orchestra would  have afforded me great pleasure--and would probably have  succeeded. [\"Gelangen\" and \"gelingen\"--untranslatable little  pun.] But unfortunately obstacles which cannot be put aside have  intervened, and it will be utterly impossible for me to be  present at the Goethe Festival, as I have to betake myself in a  few days' time to an almost unknown but very efficacious bath  resort, and my doctor's orders are most strict that I must not  make any break in my \"cure\" during six weeks.    Notwithstanding this very deplorable contretemps for me, I  immediately informed Herr Councillor A. Scholl, as head of the  Goethe Committee, of your friendly proposal. Herewith his answer.    Allow me meanwhile to refresh your memory with an old French  proverb, \"Ce qui est differe n'est pas perdu\" [What is put off is  not given up], and give me the hope that soon after my return to  Weymar we may occupy ourselves seriously with the performance of  your \"Faust.\"...    Hearty greetings to your dear wife, and believe me yours ever  most sincerely,    F. Liszt Weymar July 27th, 1849        62. To Robert Schumann    [autograph in the Royal Library in Berlin]    Dear Friend,    A summons which cannot be put off obliges me to be present at the  Goethe Festival here on the 28th of August, and to undertake the  direction of the musical part.    My first step is naturally to beg you to be so good as to send us  soon the score of your \"Faust.\" If you should be able to spare  any of the voice or orchestral parts it would be a saving of time  to us; but if not we shall willingly submit to getting the parts  copied out as quickly as possible.    Kindly excuse me, dear friend, for the manner in which this  letter contradicts my last. I am very seldom guilty in such a  way, but in this case it does not lie in me, but in the  particulars of the matter itself.    For the rest I can assure you that your \"Faust\" shall be studied  with the utmost sympathy and accuracy by the orchestra and  chorus.--Herr Montag, the conductor of the Musik-Verein [Musical  Union], is taking up the chorus rehearsals with the greatest  readiness, and the rest will be my affair!--Only, dear friend,  don't delay sending the score and, if possible, the parts.    Sincerely yours,    F. Liszt    Weymar, August 1st, 1849    If your opera is given not later than the 1st of September I  shall certainly come to Leipzig.        63. To Carl Reinecke    Heligoland, September 7th, 1849    I am very sorry, my dear M. Reinecke, not to have met you at  Hamburg. It would have been such a real pleasure to me to make  acquaintance again with your Nonet, and it seems to me, judging  from its antecedents in the form of a Concerto, that by this  decisive transformation it ought to be a most honorably  successful work.    The \"Myrthen Lieder\" have never been sent to me. If you happen to  have a copy I should be very much obliged if you would send it me  to Schuberth's address.    With regard to the article which has appeared in \"La Musique\" I  have all sorts of excuses to make to you. The editors of the  paper thought fit, I do not know why, to give it a title which I  completely disavow, and which would certainly have never entered  into my mind. Moreover the printer has not been sparing of  changing several words and omitting others. Such are the  inevitable disadvantages of articles sent by post, and of which  the proof correctors cannot read the writing.    Anyhow, such as it is, I am glad to think that it cannot have  done you any harm in the mind of the French public, which has  customs and requirements that one must know well when one wishes  above all things to serve one's friends by being just to them.    Two numbers of your \"Kleine Fantasie-Stucke\" have been  distributed, up to about a thousand copies, with the paper \"La  Musique,\" under the title of \"Bluettes,\"--a rather ill-chosen  title to my idea,--but, notwithstanding this title and the words  \"adopted by F. Liszt,\" which the editors have further taken the  responsibility of putting, I am persuaded that this publication  is a good opening (in material) into the musical world of France,  and, looking at this result only, I am charmed to have been able  to contribute to it.    I shall return to Hamburg by the last boat from Heligoland on the  27th of September, in order to go to the baths of Eilsen, where I  expect to spend all the month of October. In November I shall be  back in Weymar for the rest of the winter.    If you would have the kindness to send to Schuberth's address a  case of 250 cigars of a pretty  good size from the Bremen  Manufactory, I should be very much obliged to you, and would take  care to let you have the money (which in any case will not be a  very great sum) through Schuberth. The samples you sent me to  Weymar did reach me, but at a moment when I was extremely  occupied, so that I forgot them. Pray let me hear from you from  time to time, my dear M. Reinecke, and regard me as a friend who  is sincerely attached to you.    F. Liszt        64. To Breitkopf and Hartel    My dear Sir,    The arrival of your piano is one of the most pleasant events in  my peacefully studious life at Weymar, and I hasten to send you  my best thanks. Although, to tell the truth, I don't intend to do  much finger-work in the course of this year, yet it is no less  indispensable for me to have from time to time a perfect  instrument to play on. It is an old custom that I should regret  to change; and, as you kindly inquire after the ulterior  destination of this piano, allow me to tell you quite frankly  that I should like to keep it as long as you will leave it me for  my private, personal, and exclusive use at Weymar. In being  guilty of the so-called indiscretion I committed in claiming of  your courtesy the continued loan of one of your instruments I  thought that, under the friendly and neighborly relations which  are established between us (for a long time to come, I hope), it  would not be unwelcome to your house that one of its productions  should play the hospitable to me, whilst receiving my hospitality  at the same time. However retired and sheltered I live from stir  and movement at Weymar, yet from time to time it does happen that  I receive illustrious visitors, or curious and idle ones who come  and trouble one for this or that; henceforth I shall be delighted  to be able to do the honors of your piano both to the one and to  the other, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36903"],[0,"Marvels of Pond-life (#16)"],[1,"with a two-dram bottle. Close by the path the  _Anacharis alsinastrum_ grew in profusion, quantities of water-snails  crawled among its branches, and small fish darted in and out, threading  their mazes with lightning rapidity. Thrusting a walking-stick among the  mass of vegetation, a few little tufts were drawn up and carefully  bottled, with the addition of a little water. Returning home, a few  leaves were placed in the live-box, and on examination with the power of  sixty diameters they disclosed a specimen of, perhaps, the most  beautiful of all the rotifers, the _Stephanoceros Eichornii_. In this  elegant creature an oval body, somewhat expanded at the top, is  supported upon a tapering stalk, and stands in a gelatinous bottle,  composed of irregular rings superimposed one upon the other, as if  thrown off by successive efforts, the upper ones being inverted and  attached to the body of the animal. But that which constitutes the glory  of this little being is the crown of five tapering tentacles, each  having two rows of long cilia arranged on opposing sides, but not in the  same plane. The ordinary position of the tentacles is that of a graceful  elliptical curve, first swelling outwards, then bending inwards, until  their points closely approximate, but each is capable of independent  motion, and they are seldom quiet for many minutes at a time. The cilia  can be arranged in parallel rows or in tufts at the will of the  creature, and their motion appears under control, and susceptible of  greater modification than is exhibited by the ordinary infusoria.    [Illustration: Stephanoceros Eichornii.]    The Stephanoceros is a member of the Floscule family, but in all the  specimens I obtained and watched for several weeks, there was an  important difference in the relation of the tube to the creature. In the  Floscules I had never seen anything like an adhesion between the tube  and the animal, but in the Stephanoceros I noticed it continually, and  always in the manner already described. Like the Floscule, the  Stephanoceros is readily alarmed, and retreats into her house, carrying  with her the invaginated portion. In the last edition of 'Pritchard's  Infusoria,' this case is spoken of as apparently not tubular, but a  solid gelatinous mass, enveloping the animal as high up as the base of  the rotatory arms. It is very likely that specimens at different ages,  and possibly in different seasons, may vary in the structure of their  abodes; but I am not able to concur in the preceding account, as all the  tubes I examined resembled sacks turned in at the mouths, and attached  to the shoulders only of their inmates; and on one occasion I was able  to look down into a deserted tube, which had not collapsed, as it would  have done if it had been merely a solid gelatinous mass.    Like the Floscule, the Stephanoceros only reveals her beauties under  careful illumination. A direct light renders them invisible, and only  when the requisite obliquity has been obtained, does the exquisite  character of the structure become displayed. The dark-ground  illumination is very useful, and makes the ciliary action very distinct.  At times a view can be obtained, in which the cilia of perhaps a single  tentacle are all ranged like the steel springs of a musical box. For a  moment they are quiescent, and then they vibrate in succession, each  moving thread sparkling in the light. With a clumsy mode of lighting  them, the cilia look like stumpy bristles, and are often so drawn; but  precisely the right quantity of light coming in the right direction,  makes them appear more numerous, and much longer than would at first be  supposed. When well exhibited the tentacles have a lustre between glass  and pearl; the body, in a favorable specimen, is like a crystal cup, and  the food, usually composed of small red and green globes, glows like  emeralds and rubies, as if in the height of luxury the little epicure  had more than rivalled Cleopatra's draught, and instead of dissolving,  swallowed its jewelry whole. So lustrous and varied in colour is the  whole appearance of the animal under these circumstances, that it is  frequently alluded to by one of our first artists, to whom it was  displayed.    It is said by some authors that the tentacles are used to seize prey.  This never occurred under my observation, although their basal portions  are often approximated when an object is forced down to the grinding  apparatus below. The Stephanoceros is a ravenous feeder, and swallows a  variety of creatures. Green vegetable monads, rich red and brown globes  of similar characters, and any animalcule that comes in her way is  acceptable; and even good-sized rotifers do not escape her  all-consuming maw. On one occasion I noticed one of the loricated sort,  more than half as long as one of her tentacles, rapidly swallowed, and  passed downwards without attempting to escape. Objects much too big for  the gizzard are often gulped down, and probably receive a preliminary  softening and maceration in the crop. Very often, when food is  plentiful, the creature is filled to the brim, but still endeavours to  continue her abundant meal. From the presence of large quantities of  food and the density of the integuments, the gizzard cannot always be  seen; but in favorable specimens its teeth may be observed busily at  work.    At the base of the tentacles small masses of matter may be discovered,  which are probably nervous ganglia, and other organs; and Ehrenberg  discovered small vibrating bodies, supposed to be connected with the  function of respiration. A single egg, as shown in the annexed drawing,  is often found, and the ovarian is said to develop but few at a time.  Two red eyes are found in young specimens, but in adults they either  disappear or are not conspicuous. The Stephanoceri are sociable animals,  and when one is found, others are probably near at hand. Several may  often be discovered on the same branch of a small water-plant, of  various dimensions, and in different stages of growth. The full size is  about 1--36\" in height, and from its magnitude care is required not to  crush it in the live-box. When specimens are plentiful, some should be  placed in that convenient receptacle; and others with the plant on which  they are growing, in a glass cell or trough, where they have more room  to display their motions, and can with fresh supplies of water, be  preserved for days and weeks. With occasional renewals from one pond, I  was able to keep up a stock for about three months, and never had  objects which gave more pleasure to myself or to my friends.          CHAPTER X.    OCTOBER.        Stentors and Stephanoceri--Description of Stentors--Mode of          viewing them--Their abundance--Social habits--Solitary Stentors          living in Gelatinous caves--Propagation by divers          modes--Cephalosiphon Limnias--A group of Vaginicolae--Changes of          shape--A bubble-blowing Vorticella.      October, the finest of our autumn months, is noted for usually granting  the inhabitants of our dripping climate about twenty pleasant sunshiny  days, and it is probably on this account somewhat of a favourite with  the infusorial world, although the cold of its nights and early mornings  thins their numbers, which reach a maximum in the summer heat. Even in  the dismal year 1860, October maintained its character, and afforded a  great many opportunities of animalcule hunting, during which a constant  supply of Stephanoceri were readily obtained, together with swarms of  _Stentors_, which are not exceeded in interest by any of the Ciliated  Protozoa. The Stentors were abundant on the same weed (_Anacharis_),  that formed the residence of the Stephanoceri, and might be seen in  large numbers hanging from it like green trumpets, visible to the  unassisted eye. In the 'Micrographic Dictionary' they are said to  belong to the Vorticella family, which has already given us several  beautiful objects, and possess a marvellous power of changing their  shape. It is, however, better to follow Stein, who separates them from  the Vorticellids and ranges them in his order Heterotricha, as they have  two distinct sets of cilia, small ones covering the body and the larger  ones round the mouth. Those before us are named after this property  _Stentor polymorphus_,[18] or Many-shaped Stentors, and owe their  exquisite tint to numberless green vesicles, or small cavities filled  with colouring matter like that of plants. This, however, is not  essential to the species which may often be found of other hues. In size  this Stentor varies from a hundred and twentieth to one twenty-fourth of  an inch. It is entirely covered with fine cilia, disposed in  longitudinal rows, and round the head is a spiral wreath of larger and  very conspicuous cilia leading to the mouth.    [18] See Frontispiece.    Having observed the abundance of these creatures, a few small branches  to which they were appended, were placed in the glass trough, and viewed  with powers of sixty and one hundred linear. Some had tumbled down as  shapeless lumps, others presented broad funnel-shaped bodies; while  others stretched themselves to great length like the long, narrow  post-horns which still wake the echoes of a few old-fashioned towns. The  ciliary motion of the elegant wreath was active and rapid, causing quite  a stir among all the little particles, alive and dead; and when the  right sort of food came near the corkscrew entrance to the mouth, down  it went, and if conspicuous for colour, was subsequently seen apparently  embedded in little cavities, which Ehrenberg supposed were separate  stomachs, although that theory is now rejected. One advantage of viewing  these objects in a sufficient quantity of water, to leave them in  freedom, is that they frequently turn themselves, so that you can see  right down into them; and the drawing given in the frontispiece"]]]
