There are trees in the tropics, on which white blossoms hang close by  the withered fruit, there are days when the pale moon shows itself near  the clear bright sun;--and it is given to the soul of man to feel love  and hatred, both at the same time, and to direct both to the same end.    Nefert's tears fell as dew, her sobs as manna on the soul of Paaker,  which hungered and thirsted for revenge. Her pain was joy to him, and  yet the sight of her beauty filled him with passion, his gaze lingered  spell-bound on her graceful form; he would have given all the bliss of  heaven once, only once, to hold her in his arms--once, only once, to  hear a word of love from her lips.    After some minutes Nefert's tears grew less violent. With a weary,  almost indifferent gaze she looked at the Mohar, still standing before  her, and said in a soft tone of entreaty:    'My tongue is parched, fetch me a little water.\"    \"The princess may come out at any moment,\" replied Paaker.    \"But I am fainting,\" said Nefert, and began again to cry gently.    Paaker shrugged his shoulders, and went farther into the valley, which  he knew as well as his father's house; for in it was the tomb of his  mother's ancestors, in which, as a boy, he had put up prayers at every  full and new moon, and laid gifts on the altar.    The hut of the paraschites was prohibited to him, but he knew that  scarcely a hundred paces from the spot where Nefert was sitting, lived  an old woman of evil repute, in whose hole in the rock he could not fail  to find a drink of water.    He hastened forward, half intoxicated with had seen and felt within the  last few minutes.    The door, which at night closed the cave against the intrusions of the  plunder-seeking jackals, was wide open, and the old woman sat outside  under a ragged piece of brown sail-cloth, fastened at one end to the  rock and at the other to two posts of rough wood. She was sorting a heap  of dark and light-colored roots, which lay in her lap. Near her was a  wheel, which turned in a high wooden fork. A wryneck made fast to it  by a little chain, and by springing from spoke to spoke kept it in  continual motion.--[From Theocritus' idyl: The Sorceress.]--A large  black cat crouched beside her, and smelt at some ravens' and owls'  heads, from which the eyes had not long since been extracted.    Two sparrow-hawks sat huddled up over the door of the cave, out of which  came the sharp odor of burning juniper-berries; this was intended  to render the various emanations rising from the different strange  substances, which were collected and preserved there, innocuous.    As Paaker approached the cavern the old woman called out to some one  within:    \"Is the wax cooking?\"    An unintelligible murmur was heard in answer.    Then throw in the ape's eyes,       [The sentences and mediums employed by the witches, according to     papyrus-rolls which remain. I have availed myself of the Magic     papyrus of Harris, and of two in the Berlin collection, one of which     is in Greek. ]    and the ibis feathers, and the scraps of linen with the black signs on  them. Stir it all a little; now put out the fire,    \"Take the jug and fetch some water--make haste, here comes a stranger.\"    A sooty-black negro woman, with a piece of torn colorless stuff hanging  round her hips, set a large clay-jar on her grey woolly matted hair, and  without looking at him, went past Paaker, who was now close to the cave.    The old woman, a tall figure bent with years, with a sharply-cut and  wrinkled face, that might once have been handsome, made her preparations  for receiving the visitor by tying a gaudy kerchief over her head,  fastening her blue cotton garment round her throat, and flinging a fibre  mat over the birds' heads.    Paaker called out to her, but she feigned to be deaf and not to hear his  voice. Only when he stood quite close to her, did she raise her shrewd,  twinkling eyes, and cry out:    \"A lucky day! a white day that brings a noble guest and high honor.\"    \"Get up,\" commanded Paaker, not giving her any greeting, but throwing a  silver ring among the roots that lay in her lap,       [The Egyptians had no coins before Alexander and the Ptolemies, but     used metals for exchange, usually in the form of rings.]    \"and give me in exchange for good money some water in a clean vessel.\"    \"Fine pure silver,\" said the old woman, while she held the ring, which  she had quickly picked out from the roots, close to her eyes; \"it is too  much for mere water, and too little for my good liquors.\"    \"Don't chatter, hussy, but make haste,\" cried Paaker, taking another  ring from his money-bag and throwing it into her lap.    \"Thou hast an open hand,\" said the old woman, speaking in the dialect  of the upper classes; \"many doors must be open to thee, for money is  a pass-key that turns any lock. Would'st thou have water for thy good  money? Shall it protect thee against noxious beasts?--shall it help thee  to reach down a star? Shall it guide thee to secret paths?--It is thy  duty to lead the way. Shall it make heat cold, or cold warm? Shall  it give thee the power of reading hearts, or shall it beget beautiful  dreams? Wilt thou drink of the water of knowledge and see whether thy  friend or thine enemy--ha! if thine enemy shall die? Would'st thou a  drink to strengthen thy memory? Shall the water make thee invisible? or  remove the 6th toe from thy left foot?\"    \"You know me?\" asked Paaker.    \"How should I?\" said the old woman, \"but my eyes are sharp, and I can  prepare good waters for great and small.\"    \"Mere babble!\" exclaimed Paaker, impatiently clutching at the whip in  his girdle; \"make haste, for the lady for whom--\"    \"Dost thou want the water for a lady?\" interrupted the old woman. \"Who  would have thought it?--old men certainly ask for my philters much  oftener than young ones--but I can serve thee.\"    With these words the old woman went into the cave, and soon returned  with a thin cylindrical flask of alabaster in her hand.    \"This is the drink,\" she said, giving the phial to Paaker. \"Pour half  into water, and offer it to the lady. If it does not succeed at first,  it is certain the second time. A child may drink the water and it will  not hurt him, or if an old man takes it, it makes him gay. Ah, I know  the taste of it!\" and she moistened her lips with the white fluid. \"It  can hurt no one, but I will take no more of it, or old Hekt will be  tormented with love and longing for thee; and that would ill please the  rich young lord, ha! ha! If the drink is in vain I am paid enough, if  it takes effect thou shalt bring me three more gold rings; and thou wilt  return, I know it well.\"    Paaker had listened motionless to the old woman, and siezed the flask  eagerly, as if bidding defiance to some adversary; he put it in his  money bag, threw a few more rings at the feet of the witch, and once  more hastily demanded a bowl of Nile-water.    \"Is my lord in such a hurry?\" muttered the old woman, once more going  into the cave. \"He asks if I know him? him certainly I do? but  the darling? who can it be hereabouts? perhaps little Uarda at the  paraschites yonder. She is pretty enough; but she is lying on a mat, run  over and dying. We must see what my lord means. He would have pleased  me well enough, if I were young; but he will reach the goal, for he is  resolute and spares no one.\"    While she muttered these and similar words, she filled a graceful cup of  glazed earthenware with filtered Nile-water, which she poured out of a  large porous clay jar, and laid a laurel leaf, on which was scratched  two hearts linked together by seven strokes, on the surface of the  limpid fluid. Then she stepped out into the air again.    As Paaker took the vessel from her looked at the laurel leaf, she said:    \"This indeed binds hearts; three is the husband, four is the wife,  seven is the chachach, charcharachacha.\"--[This jargon is fund in a  magic-papyrus at Berlin.]    The old woman sang this spell not without skill; but the Mohar appeared  not to listen to her jargon. He descended carefully into the valley, and  directed his steps to the resting place of the wife of Mena.    By the side of a rock, which hill him from Nefert, he paused, set the  cup on a flat block of stone, and drew the flask with the philter out of  his girdle.    His fingers trembled, but a thousand voices seemed to surge up and cry:    \"Take it!--do it!--put in the drink!--now or never.\" He felt like a  solitary traveller, who finds on his road the last will of a relation  whose possessions he had hoped for, but which disinherits him. Shall he  surrender it to the judge, or shall he destroy it.    Paaker was not merely outwardly devout; hitherto he had in everything  intended to act according to the prescriptions of the religion of his  fathers. Adultery was a heavy sin; but had not he an older right to  Nefert than the king's charioteer?    He who followed the black arts of magic, should, according to the law,  be punished by death, and the old woman had a bad name for her evil  arts; but he had not sought her for the sake of the philter. Was it not  possible that the Manes of his forefathers, that the Gods themselves,  moved by his prayers and offerings, had put him in possession by an  accident--which was almost a miracle--of the magic potion efficacy he  never for an instant doubted?    Paaker's associates held him to be a man of quick decision, and, in  fact, in difficult cases he could act with unusual rapidity, but what  guided him in these cases, was not the swift-winged judgment of a  prepared and well-schooled brain, but usually only resulted from the  outcome of a play of question and answer.    Amulets of the most various kinds hung round his neck, and from his  girdle, all consecrated by priests, and of special sanctity or the  highest efficacy.    There was the lapis"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],[0,"An Egyptian Princess â€” Complete (#16)"],[1,"er, and for the first time  after long years of silence, I heard him speak. Terror had loosened his  tongue; in that dreadful hour Gyges learnt once more to speak, and I,  who but the moment before had been cursing the gods, bowed down before  their power. I had commanded a slave to kill me the moment I should be  taken prisoner by the Persians, but now I deprived him of his sword. I  was a changed man, and by degrees learnt ever more and more to subdue  the rage and indignation which yet from time to time would boil up again  within my soul, rebellious against my fate and my noble enemies. Thou  knowest that at last I became the friend of Cyrus, and that my son grew  up at his court, a free man at my side, having entirely regained the use  of his speech. Everything beautiful and good that I had heard, seen  or thought during my long life I treasured up now for him; he was my  kingdom, my crown, my treasure. Cyrus's days of care, his nights so reft  of sleep, reminded me with horror of my own former greatness, and from  day to day it became more evident to me that happiness has nothing to  do with our outward circumstances. Each man possesses the hidden germ in  his own heart. A contented, patient mind, rejoicing much in all that  is great and beautiful and yet despising not the day of small things;  bearing sorrow without a murmur and sweetening it by calling to  remembrance former joy; moderation in all things; a firm trust in the  favor of the gods and a conviction that, all things being subject to  change, so with us too the worst must pass in due season; all this helps  to mature the germ of happiness, and gives us power to smile, where the  man undisciplined by fate might yield to despair and fear.\"    Amasis listened attentively, drawing figures the while in the sand with  the golden flower on his staff. At last he spoke:    \"Verily, Croesus, I the great god, the 'sun of righteousness,' 'the son  of Neith,' 'the lord of warlike glory,' as the Egyptians call me, am  tempted to envy thee, dethroned and plundered as thou art. I have been  as happy as thou art now. Once I was known through all Egypt, though  only the poor son of a captain, for my light heart, happy temper, fun  and high spirits. The common soldiers would do anything for me, my  superior officers could have found much fault, but in the mad Amasis,  as they called me, all was overlooked, and among my equals, (the other  under-officers) there could be no fun or merry-making unless I took a  share in it. My predecessor king Hophra sent us against Cyrene. Seized  with thirst in the desert, we refused to go on; and a suspicion that the  king intended to sacrifice us to the Greek mercenaries drove the army to  open mutiny. In my usual joking manner I called out to my friends: 'You  can never get on without a king, take me for your ruler; a merrier you  will never find!' The soldiers caught the words. 'Amasis will be our  king,' ran through the ranks from man to man, and, in a few hours more,  they came to me with shouts, and acclamations of 'The good, jovial  Amasis for our King!' One of my boon companions set a field-marshal's  helmet on my head: I made the joke earnest, and we defeated Hophra at  Momempliis. The people joined in the conspiracy, I ascended the throne,  and men pronounced me fortunate. Up to that time I had been every  Egyptian's friend, and now I was the enemy of the best men in the  nation.    \"The priests swore allegiance to me, and accepted me as a member of  their caste, but only in the hope of guiding me at their will. My former  superiors in command either envied me, or wished to remain on the same  terms of intercourse as formerly. But this would have been inconsistent  with my new position, and have undermined my authority. One day,  therefore, when the officers of the host were at one of my banquets and  attempting, as usual, to maintain their old convivial footing, I showed  them the golden basin in which their feet had been washed before sitting  down to meat; five days later, as they were again drinking at one of my  revels, I caused a golden image of the great god Ra be placed upon the  richly-ornamented banqueting-table.       [Ra, with the masculine article Phra, must be regarded as the     central point of the sun-worship of the Egyptians, which we consider     to have been the foundation of their entire religion. He was more     especially worshipped at Heliopolis. Plato, Eudoxus, and probably     Pythagoras also, profited by the teaching of his priests. The     obelisks, serving also as memorial monuments on which the names and     deeds of great kings were recorded, were sacred to him, and Pliny     remarks of them that they represented the rays of the sun. He was     regarded as the god of light, the director of the entire visible     creation, over which he reigned, as Osiris over the world of     spirits.]    \"On perceiving it, they fell down to worship. As they rose from  their knees, I took the sceptre, and holding it up on high with much  solemnity, exclaimed: 'In five days an artificer has transformed the  despised vessel into which ye spat and in which men washed your feet,  into this divine image. Such a vessel was I, but the Deity, which can  fashion better and more quickly than a goldsmith, has made me your king.  Bow down then before me and worship. He who henceforth refuses to obey,  or is unmindful of the reverence due to the king, is guilty of death!'    \"They fell down before me, every one, and I saved my authority, but lost  my friends. As I now stood in need of some other prop, I fixed on the  Hellenes, knowing that in all military qualifications one Greek is worth  more than five Egyptians, and that with this assistance I should be able  to carry out those measures which I thought beneficial.    \"I kept the Greek mercenaries always round me, I learnt their language,  and it was they who brought to me the noblest human being I ever met,  Pythagoras. I endeavored to introduce Greek art and manners among  ourselves, seeing what folly lay in a self-willed adherence to that  which has been handed down to us, when it is in itself bad and unworthy,  while the good seed lay on our Egyptian soil, only waiting to be sown.    \"I portioned out the whole land to suit my purposes, appointed the best  police in the world, and accomplished much; but my highest aim, namely:  to infuse into this country, at once so gay and so gloomy, the spirit  and intellect of the Greeks, their sense of beauty in form, their love  of life and joy in it, this all was shivered on the same rock which  threatens me with overthrow and ruin whenever I attempt to accomplish  anything new. The priests are my opponents, my masters, they hang like a  dead weight upon me. Clinging with superstitious awe to all that is old  and traditionary, abominating everything foreign, and regarding every  stranger as the natural enemy of their authority and their teaching,  they can lead the most devout and religious of all nations with a power  that has scarcely any limits. For this I am forced to sacrifice all my  plans, for this I see my life passing away in bondage to their severe  ordinances, this will rob my death-bed of peace, and I cannot be secure  that this host of proud mediators between god and man will allow me to  rest even in my grave!\"    \"By Zeus our saviour, with all thy good fortune, thou art to be pitied!\"  interrupted Croesus sympathetically, \"I understand thy misery; for  though I have met with many an individual who passed through life darkly  and gloomily, I could not have believed that an entire race of human  beings existed, to whom a gloomy, sullen heart was as natural as a  poisonous tooth to the serpent. Yet it is true, that on my journey  hither and during my residence at this court I have seen none but morose  and gloomy countenances among the priesthood. Even the youths, thy  immediate attendants, are never seen to smile; though cheerfulness,  that sweet gift of the gods, usually belongs to the young, as flowers to  spring.\"    \"Thou errest,\" answered Amasis, \"in believing this gloom to be a  universal characteristic of the Egyptians. It is true that our religion  requires much serious thought. There are few nations, however, who have  so largely the gift of bantering fun and joke: or who on the occasion  of a festival, can so entirely forget themselves and everything else but  the enjoyments of the moment; but the very sight of a stranger is odious  to the priests, and the moroseness which thou observest is intended as  retaliation on me for my alliance with the strangers. Those very boys,  of whom thou spakest, are the greatest torment of my life. They perform  for me the service of slaves, and obey my slightest nod. One might  imagine that the parents who devote their children to this service,  and who are the highest in rank among the priesthood, would be the most  obedient and reverential servants of the king whom they profess to honor  as divine; but believe me, Croesus, just in this very act of devotion,  which no ruler can refuse to accept without giving offence, lies the  most crafty, scandalous calculation. Each of these youths is my keeper,  my spy. They watch my smallest actions and report them at once to the  priests.\"    \"But how canst thou endure such an existence? Why not banish these spies  and select servants from the military caste, for instance? They would be  quite as useful as the priests.\"    \"Ah! if I only could, if I dared!\" exclaimed Amasis loudly. And then,  as if frightened at his own rashness, he continued in a low voice, \"I  believe that even here I am being watched. To-morrow I will have that  grove of fig-trees yonder uprooted. The young priest there, who seems  so fond of gardening, has other fruit in his mind besides the half-ripe  figs that he is so slowly dropping into his basket. While his hand is  plucking the figs, his ear gathers the words that fall from the mouth of  his"]]]
