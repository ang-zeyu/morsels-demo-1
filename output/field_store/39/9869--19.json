Mirth,  laughter, play, frolic, seem gratuitous satisfactions, which have no  further tendency: spleen, melancholy, discontent, superstition, are pains  of the same nature. How then does the Divine benevolence display itself,  in the sense of you Anthropomorphites? None but we Mystics, as you were  pleased to call us, can account for this strange mixture of phenomena, by  deriving it from attributes, infinitely perfect, but incomprehensible.    And have you at last, said CLEANTHES smiling, betrayed your intentions,  PHILO? Your long agreement with DEMEA did indeed a little surprise me;  but I find you were all the while erecting a concealed battery against  me. And I must confess, that you have now fallen upon a subject worthy of  your noble spirit of opposition and controversy. If you can make out the  present point, and prove mankind to be unhappy or corrupted, there is an  end at once of all religion. For to what purpose establish the natural  attributes of the Deity, while the moral are still doubtful and  uncertain?    You take umbrage very easily, replied DEMEA, at opinions the most  innocent, and the most generally received, even amongst the religious and  devout themselves: and nothing can be more surprising than to find a  topic like this, concerning the wickedness and misery of man, charged  with no less than Atheism and profaneness. Have not all pious divines and  preachers, who have indulged their rhetoric on so fertile a subject; have  they not easily, I say, given a solution of any difficulties which may  attend it? This world is but a point in comparison of the universe; this  life but a moment in comparison of eternity. The present evil phenomena,  therefore, are rectified in other regions, and in some future period of  existence. And the eyes of men, being then opened to larger views of  things, see the whole connection of general laws; and trace with  adoration, the benevolence and rectitude of the Deity, through all the  mazes and intricacies of his providence.    No! replied CLEANTHES, No! These arbitrary suppositions can never be  admitted, contrary to matter of fact, visible and uncontroverted. Whence  can any cause be known but from its known effects? Whence can any  hypothesis be proved but from the apparent phenomena? To establish one  hypothesis upon another, is building entirely in the air; and the utmost  we ever attain, by these conjectures and fictions, is to ascertain the  bare possibility of our opinion; but never can we, upon such terms,  establish its reality.    The only method of supporting Divine benevolence, and it is what I  willingly embrace, is to deny absolutely the misery and wickedness of  man. Your representations are exaggerated; your melancholy views mostly  fictitious; your inferences contrary to fact and experience. Health is  more common than sickness; pleasure than pain; happiness than misery. And  for one vexation which we meet with, we attain, upon computation, a  hundred enjoyments.    Admitting your position, replied PHILO, which yet is extremely doubtful,  you must at the same time allow, that if pain be less frequent than  pleasure, it is infinitely more violent and durable. One hour of it is  often able to outweigh a day, a week, a month of our common insipid  enjoyments; and how many days, weeks, and months, are passed by several  in the most acute torments? Pleasure, scarcely in one instance, is ever  able to reach ecstasy and rapture; and in no one instance can it continue  for any time at its highest pitch and altitude. The spirits evaporate,  the nerves relax, the fabric is disordered, and the enjoyment quickly  degenerates into fatigue and uneasiness. But pain often, good God, how  often! rises to torture and agony; and the longer it continues, it  becomes still more genuine agony and torture. Patience is exhausted,  courage languishes, melancholy seizes us, and nothing terminates our  misery but the removal of its cause, or another event, which is the sole  cure of all evil, but which, from our natural folly, we regard with still  greater horror and consternation.    But not to insist upon these topics, continued PHILO, though most  obvious, certain, and important; I must use the freedom to admonish you,  CLEANTHES, that you have put the controversy upon a most dangerous issue,  and are unawares introducing a total scepticism into the most essential  articles of natural and revealed theology. What! no method of fixing a  just foundation for religion, unless we allow the happiness of human  life, and maintain a continued existence even in this world, with all our  present pains, infirmities, vexations, and follies, to be eligible and  desirable! But this is contrary to every one's feeling and experience: It  is contrary to an authority so established as nothing can subvert. No  decisive proofs can ever be produced against this authority; nor is it  possible for you to compute, estimate, and compare, all the pains and all  the pleasures in the lives of all men and of all animals: And thus, by  your resting the whole system of religion on a point, which, from its  very nature, must for ever be uncertain, you tacitly confess, that that  system is equally uncertain.    But allowing you what never will be believed, at least what you never  possibly can prove, that animal, or at least human happiness, in this  life, exceeds its misery, you have yet done nothing: For this is not, by  any means, what we expect from infinite power, infinite wisdom, and  infinite goodness. Why is there any misery at all in the world? Not by  chance surely. From some cause then. Is it from the intention of the  Deity? But he is perfectly benevolent. Is it contrary to his intention?  But he is almighty. Nothing can shake the solidity of this reasoning, so  short, so clear, so decisive; except we assert, that these subjects  exceed all human capacity, and that our common measures of truth and  falsehood are not applicable to them; a topic which I have all along  insisted on, but which you have, from the beginning, rejected with scorn  and indignation.    But I will be contented to retire still from this entrenchment, for I  deny that you can ever force me in it. I will allow, that pain or misery  in man is compatible with infinite power and goodness in the Deity, even  in your sense of these attributes: What are you advanced by all these  concessions? A mere possible compatibility is not sufficient. You must  prove these pure, unmixed, and uncontrollable attributes from the present  mixed and confused phenomena, and from these alone. A hopeful  undertaking! Were the phenomena ever so pure and unmixed, yet being  finite, they would be insufficient for that purpose. How much more, where  they are also so jarring and discordant!    Here, CLEANTHES, I find myself at ease in my argument. Here I triumph.  Formerly, when we argued concerning the natural attributes of  intelligence and design, I needed all my sceptical and metaphysical  subtlety to elude your grasp. In many views of the universe, and of its  parts, particularly the latter, the beauty and fitness of final causes  strike us with such irresistible force, that all objections appear (what  I believe they really are) mere cavils and sophisms; nor can we then  imagine how it was ever possible for us to repose any weight on them. But  there is no view of human life, or of the condition of mankind, from  which, without the greatest violence, we can infer the moral attributes,  or learn that infinite benevolence, conjoined with infinite power and  infinite wisdom, which we must discover by the eyes of faith alone. It is  your turn now to tug the labouring oar, and to support your philosophical  subtleties against the dictates of plain reason and experience.          PART 11      I scruple not to allow, said CLEANTHES, that I have been apt to suspect  the frequent repetition of the word infinite, which we meet with in all  theological writers, to savour more of panegyric than of philosophy; and  that any purposes of reasoning, and even of religion, would be better  served, were we to rest contented with more accurate and more moderate  expressions. The terms, admirable, excellent, superlatively great, wise,  and holy; these sufficiently fill the imaginations of men; and any thing  beyond, besides that it leads into absurdities, has no influence on the  affections or sentiments. Thus, in the present subject, if we abandon all  human analogy, as seems your intention, DEMEA, I am afraid we abandon all  religion, and retain no conception of the great object of our adoration.  If we preserve human analogy, we must for ever find it impossible to  reconcile any mixture of evil in the universe with infinite attributes;  much less can we ever prove the latter from the former. But supposing the  Author of Nature to be finitely perfect, though far exceeding mankind, a  satisfactory account may then be given of natural and moral evil, and  every untoward phenomenon be explained and adjusted. A less evil may then  be chosen, in order to avoid a greater; inconveniences be submitted to,  in order to reach a desirable end; and in a word, benevolence, regulated  by wisdom, and limited by necessity, may produce just such a world as the  present. You, PHILO, who are so prompt at starting views, and  reflections, and analogies, I would gladly hear, at length, without  interruption, your opinion of this new theory; and if it deserve our  attention, we may afterwards, at more leisure, reduce it into form.    My sentiments, replied PHILO, are not worth being made a mystery of; and  therefore, without any ceremony, I shall deliver what occurs to me with  regard to the present subject. It must, I think, be allowed, that if a  very limited intelligence, whom we shall suppose utterly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45846"],[0,"Letters Exhibiting the Most Prominent Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of (#16)"],[1,"terms.  Then, if we can show from the New Testament what kind of body or  person Jesus Christ had, we can also tell what kind of body the Father  has, because they are alike. One is the express image of the other.  If one has a fleshy material body, the other has the same. If one  resembles in stature the seed of the woman, the other also wears the  same resemblance. If one can be so \"_condensed_\" as to speak and walk,  and feel and act like a man, the other can do the same. If one wearing  a body of flesh and bones, in all points like unto his brethren,  is capable of holding all power in heaven and earth, and also of  displaying the brightness of celestial glory, the other can do the same  in a similar body of flesh and bones.    Well, now, what kind of body or person had Jesus Christ, which  looked so much like the Father's person? Was it an airy, invisible,  evanescent, mystical _nothing_, which some would denominate spirit? No,  by no means; very much otherwise. Hearken now, my dear sir, and all ye  readers, that have an honest desire to _know_ the living and true God,  and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent, in order that men might know from  the person of the Son what is the personal appearance of the Father.  He, \"_the Word, was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we beheld his  glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace  and truth_.\" Jesus had a fleshly form like the seed of Abraham, and  being begotten of the Father he partook of his likeness. Men beheld his  glory in human form, and Paul says that his glory was the glory of the  Father.    It appears from the conduct of some of his disciples, that they, like  sectarian churches now, were tinctured with the idea that Christ, after  his death and resurrection, was purely and exclusively a _Spirit_; but  he tells them to handle him and see that \"_a Spirit has not flesh and  bones as ye see me have_.\" And he eat and drank with them as aforetime  with his resurrected body, and afterwards ascended up from their midst  with the same bloodless body into heaven; and in like manner will he  come again.    Thus, sir, the notion of a God that is exclusively _Spirit_ without  bodily form, was banished from the minds of the disciples that saw  the bodily image of the Father in the person of the Son after his  resurrection. From heaven he will come again in like manner, and every  eye shall see him, and they that have pierced him. But the popular  God of modern times, that has no body or parts, cannot be seen. But,  sir, this popular God that has sprung into fashion, since the age of  revelation, has no resemblance to Jesus Christ, who has both body and  parts, and is the exact image of his Father. Jesus Christ declared  that he could exercise all power in heaven and earth while he was in  the body. His Father could do the same, because they were alike. It  required no extraordinary _condensation_ of the infinity of Jesus in  order to reveal himself to men, or in order that men should behold his  glory.    But we have other proofs that the person of God the Father is like  the bodily form of Christ's resurrected person. God has declared that  man is in his image. Man was created in the image of God, and in the  likeness of God; and the bodies of holy men are destined to be like  unto Christ's own most glorious body; that is as much as to say that  they are like the body of Christ in the heavenly state.    If the foregoing, and many other similar passages of scripture, do not  go to show that the Supreme Being bears a personal appearance like unto  the person of his Son, and consequently like unto any other resurrected  body of a righteous man, then we are in a labyrinth of doubt how to  interpret the most plain and unequivocal language. If the language of  scripture does not bear me out in the conclusion that man is in the  form of God, then there are no infallible way-marks or criteria by  which I can safely interpret scriptures. And the votaries of Vishnoo  have as good scriptural reason to believe in their theory of deific  annihilation, as others have to believe in a God without body, or  parts, or passions.    The scriptures plainly deny both theories, as they do that God is a  person some millions of miles in the height of his stature. Common  sense cannot grasp the idea of any _being_ or _thing_ whatever,  that is without body or parts. Even the most subtle and refined  spirit conceivable, is a _material existence_ as far removed from  immateriality as the east is from the west.    Now, sir, suffer me to entreat you to abandon all such crude theories  concerning God, which are as baseless and unscriptural as the most  extravagant vagaries of the heathen, and confine your faith to the  simple obvious testimony of Jesus and the prophets. And remember that  this is not a subject of little importance; for it is written, that,  _to know God and Jesus Christ is eternal life_. No man can understand  the import of eternal life, nor how it is secured to believers, that  does not _know God_ and Jesus Christ. In God and Christ is eternal  life. This life is not barely the perpetuity of existence, for even the  wicked exist for ever, but it is called in scripture the \"_power_ of  endless life.\" This _power_ of multiplying or creating life emanated in  that Melchizedek priesthood of which Jesus is the head and High Priest.  This is the gift of God to men who keep his commandments, and the  greatest of all gifts. Unsearchable riches accompany this gift. When  God created man, he created him in his own image (male and female), in  order that he too might have the power of multiplying life after the  order of Melchizedek, through obedience.    Now, sir, should it not be a matter of delight to you, that man is  created in the image of God, and crowned with glory and honour through  faith in Christ. Will not Peter and his fellow-desciples rejoice to  recognise that same Jesus who ascended to heaven with a body like their  own, and if Jesus bears the image of the Father, they will be equally  familiar with the Highest. What is there, sir, that contributes more to  the glory of God than his _creative power_, by which he brings myriads  of living intelligences into being, through whom a chaotic universe is  organized into works of beauty, taste, grandeur, and glory? All these  creations are for the righteous pleasure of Him who created them.    We all are the offspring of God, and the loyal offspring of God are the  greatest delight and concern of God. For them he is ever ready to make  the greatest sacrifice possible. Not only is filial reverence displayed  from them to Him, the fountain of life, but by them is shown forth the  manifold wisdom and power of God. And when men, by humble obedience,  become worthy of eternal life, the Almighty bestows upon them the like  precious _creative gift_. But this gift of life is in his Son, and He  never bestows it upon unworthy subjects. Thus by the law of adoption  men become the sons and daughters of the Almighty, and receive the  priestly \"_power of endless life_,\" which is after the order of the  Son of God. Hence the marvellous language of scripture, \"I said ye  are God's to whom the word of God came.\" Jesus virtually said on one  occasion, \"If holy men are the sons of God, and consequently heirs  to His throne, privileges, and glory, then marvel not that I (Jesus)  should claim to be a God or the Son of God!\" For Paul says, \"_there be  in heaven Gods many, and Lords many, yet to us there is but one God.  Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge_.\"    In conclusion, I will drop a passing remark or two concerning the abode  or dwelling place of God, with a brief hint of his moral attributes.  As Jesus is our light and example, we can learn of the Father's abode  from his Son. The Son ascended up into _heaven_ and to his God and our  God. The scriptures abundantly declare that a place called _heaven_ is  the peculiar dwelling place of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus  Christ. Now, if heaven is not a _literal, bona fide place_, but only  an imaginary phantom, then it follows that Jesus went to no place, but  continued to ascend up, till, in his glorious flight, He reached--  shall I call it Nichban--an imaginary phantom--or annihilation!    Be not displeased, dear sir, I am not trifling with your religion,  but am bound by truth and the love of God, to unfold its naked  absurdity, in order that you, my beloved friend, and all good men  may recoil from such gross Gentile vagaries, and exclaim, in the  language of scripture, \"_Our Fathers have inherited lies, vanity,  and things wherein there is no profit_.\" If you will read carefully  the scripture accounts of the visions of holy men, that have been  permitted to look in upon the heavenly residence of God, where Jesus  and all the resurrected bodies of the righteous abide, and eat and  drink, you will be constrained to acknowledge every appearance of a  splendid local abode. Mansions--streets--rivers--trees--precious metals  --thrones--persons--apparel--animals--ministering personages in all the  courtly livery of unspeakable celestial glory! The heaven of all the  holy prophets!    God's holy dwelling place, is literal, local, real, and to its  occupants, it is visible and tangible. It is by no means a matterless,  passionless, mystical region of extatic and endless songs from the  lips of immaterial spirits, offered in praise to some Great Spirit,  equally passionless and immaterially chaotic, spreading infinitely  through all space without centre or circumference. If such is the God  that men expect to adore in heaven, mankind would present but a faint  image of him, yea, even Jesus, who partook of man's likeness, could not  have been the brightness of the Father's glory, and express image of  his person. He declares that He has given us an image and likeness of  himself in the person of man. But who would ever recognise their Father  and Jesus"]]]
