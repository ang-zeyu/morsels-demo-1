Then it is unfortunate that she and that boy have fallen in with each  other. She may get him to speak to Uncle Oliver in her behalf.\"    \"Isn't he working for pa?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Why don't you get pa to discharge him while Uncle Oliver is away?\"    \"Well thought of, Alonzo! I will speak to your father this very  evening.\"        CHAPTER XXII.    PHIL IS \"BOUNCED.\"    Saturday, as is usual in such establishments, was pay-day at the store  of Phil's employers. The week's wages were put up in small envelopes and  handed to the various clerks.    When Phil went up to the cashier to get his money he put it quietly into  his vest-pocket.    Daniel Dickson, the cashier, observing this, said:    \"Brent, you had better open your envelope.\"    Rather surprised, Phil nevertheless did as requested.    In the envelope, besides the five-dollar bill representing his week's  salary, he found a small slip of paper, on which was written these  ominous words:    \"Your services will not be required after this week.\" Appended to this  notice was the name of the firm.    Phil turned pale, for to him, embarrassed as he was, the loss of his  place was a very serious matter.    \"What does this mean, Mr. Dickson?\" he asked quickly.    \"I can't inform you,\" answered the cashier, smiling unpleasantly, for he  was a selfish man who sympathized with no one, and cared for no one as  long as he himself remained prosperous.    \"Who handed you this paper?\" asked Phil.    \"The boss.\"    \"Mr. Pitkin?\"    \"Of course.\"    Mr. Pitkin was still in his little office, and Phil made his way  directly to him.    \"May I speak to you, sir?\" asked our hero.    \"Be quick about it then, for I am in a hurry,\" answered Pitkin, in a  very forbidding tone.    \"Why am I discharged, sir?\"    \"I can't go into details. We don't need you any longer.\"    \"Are you not satisfied with me?\"    \"No!\" said Pitkin brusquely.    \"In what respect have I failed to satisfy you, sir?\"    \"Don't put on any airs, boy!\" returned Pitkin. \"We don't want you,  that's all.\"    \"You might have given me a little notice,\" said Phil indignantly.    \"We made no stipulation of that kind, I believe.\"    \"It would only be fair, sir.\"    \"No impertinence, young man! I won't stand it! I don't need any  instructions as to the manner of conducting my business.\"    Phil by this time perceived that his discharge was decided upon without  any reference to the way in which he had performed his duties, and that  any discussion or remonstrance would be unavailing.    \"I see, sir, that you have no regard for justice, and will leave you,\"  he said.    \"You'd better, and without delay!\" said Pitkin irascibly.    Phil emerged upon the street with a sinking heart. His available funds  consisted only of the money he had just received and seventy-five cents  in change, and what he was to do he did not know. He walked home with  slow steps, looking sad in spite of his usually hopeful temperament.    When he entered the house he met Mrs. Forbush in the hall. She at once  noticed his gravity.    \"Have you had any bad luck, Philip?\" she asked.    \"Yes,\" answered Phil. \"I have lost my situation.\"    \"Indeed!\" returned the landlady, with quick sympathy. \"Have you had any  difficulty with your employer?\"    \"Not that I am aware of.\"    \"Did he assign any reason for your discharge?\"    \"No; I asked him for an explanation, but he merely said I was not wanted  any longer.\"    \"Isn't there any chance of his taking you back?\"    \"I am sure there is not.\"    \"Don't be discouraged, Philip. A smart boy like you won't be long out of  a place. Meanwhile you are welcome to stay here as long as I have a roof  to cover me.\"    \"Thank you, Mrs. Forbush,\" said Phil warmly, \"you are a true friend. You  are in trouble yourself, yet you stand by me!\"    \"I have had a stroke of good luck to-day,\" said Mrs. Forbush cheerfully.  \"A former boarder, whom I allowed to remain here for five or six weeks  when he was out of employment, has sent me thirty dollars in payment of  his bill, from Boston, where he found a position. So I shall be able to  pay my rent and have something over. I have been lucky, and so may you.\"    Phil was cheered by the ready sympathy of his landlady, and began to  take a more cheerful view of matters.    \"I will go out bright and early on Monday and see if I can't find  another place,\" he said. \"Perhaps it may be all for the best.\"    Yet on the day succeeding he had some sober hours. How differently  he had been situated only three months before. Then he had a home and  relatives. Now he was practically alone in the world, with no home  in which he could claim a share, and he did not even know where his  step-mother and Jonas were. Sunday forenoon he attended church, and  while he sat within its sacred precincts his mind was tranquilized, and  his faith and cheerfulness increased.    On Monday he bought the Herald, and made a tour of inquiry wherever he  saw that a boy was wanted. But in each place he was asked if he could  produce a recommendation from his last employer. He decided to go back  to his old place and ask for one, though he was very reluctant to ask  a favor of any kind from a man who had treated him so shabbily as Mr.  Pitkin. It seemed necessary, however, and he crushed down his pride and  made his way to Mr. Pitkin's private office.    \"Mr. Pitkin!\" he said.    \"You here!\" exclaimed Pitkin, scowling. \"You needn't ask to be taken  back. It's no use.\"    \"I don't ask it,\" answered Phil.    \"Then what are you here for?\"    \"I would like a letter of recommendation, that I may obtain another  place.\"    \"Well, well!\" said Pitkin, wagging his head. \"If that isn't impudence.\"    \"What is impudence?\" asked Phil. \"I did as well as I could, and that I  am ready to do for another employer. But all ask me for a letter from  you.\"    \"You won't get any!\" said Pitkin abruptly.    \"Where is your home?\"    \"I have none except in this city.\"    \"Where did you come from?\"    \"From the country.\"    \"Then I advise you to go back there. You may do for the country. You are  out of place in the city.\"    Poor Phil! Things did indeed look dark for him. Without a letter of  recommendation from Mr. Pitkin it would be almost impossible for him to  secure another place, and how could he maintain himself in the city? He  didn't wish to sell papers or black boots, and those were about the only  paths now open to him.    \"I am having a rough time!\" he thought, \"but I will try not to get  discouraged.\"    He turned upon his heel and walked out of the store.    As he passed the counter where Wilbur was standing, the young man said:    \"I am awfully sorry, Philip. It's a shame! If I wasn't broke I'd offer  to lend you a fiver.\"    \"Thank you all the same for your kind offer, Wilbur,\" said Phil.    \"Come round and see me.\"    \"So I will--soon.\"    He left the store and wandered aimlessly about the streets.    Four days later, sick with hope deferred, he made his way down to the  wharf of the Charleston and Savannah boats, with a vague idea that he  might get a job of carrying baggage, for he felt that he must not let  his pride interfere with doing anything by which he could earn an honest  penny.    It so happened that the Charleston boat was just in, and the passengers  were just landing.    Phil stood on the pier and gazed listlessly at them as they disembarked.    All at once he started in surprise, and his heart beat joyfully.    There, just descending the gang-plank, was his tried friend, Mr. Oliver  Carter, whom he supposed over a thousand miles away in Florida.    \"Mr. Carter!\" exclaimed Phil, dashing forward.    \"Philip!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, much surprised. \"How came you  here? Did Mr. Pitkin send you?\"          CHAPTER XXIII.    AN EXPLANATION.    It would be hard to tell which of the two was the more surprised at the  meeting, Philip or Mr. Carter.    \"I don't understand how Mr. Pitkin came to hear of my return. I didn't  telegraph,\" said the old gentleman.    \"I don't think he knows anything about it,\" said Phil.    \"Didn't he send you to the pier?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Then how is it that you are not in the store at this time?\" asked Mr.  Carter, puzzled.    \"Because I am no longer in Mr. Pitkin's employ. I was discharged last  Saturday.\"    \"Discharged! What for?\"    \"Mr. Pitkin gave no reason. He said my services were no longer  required. He spoke roughly to me, and has since declined to give me a  recommendation, though I told him that without it I should be unable to  secure employment elsewhere.\"    Mr. Carter frowned. He was evidently annoyed and indignant.    \"This must be inquired into,\" he said. \"Philip, call a carriage, and I  will at once go to the Astor House and take a room. I had intended to  go at once to Mr. Pitkin's, but I shall not do so until I have had an  explanation of this outrageous piece of business.\"    Phil was rejoiced to hear this, for he was at the end of his resources,  and the outlook for him was decidedly gloomy. He had about made up his  mind to sink his pride and go into business as a newsboy the next day,  but the very unexpected arrival of Mr. Carter put quite a new face on  matters.    He called a carriage, and both he and Mr. Carter entered it.    \"How do you happen to be back so soon, sir?\" asked Phil, when they were  seated. \"I thought you were going to Florida for a couple of months.\"    \"I started with that intention, but on reaching Charleston I changed my  mind. I expected to find some friends at St. Augustine, but I learned  that they were already returning to the North, and I felt that I should  be lonely and decided to return. I am very glad I did, now. Did you  receive my letter?\"    \"Your letter?\" queried Philip, looking at Mr. Carter in surprise.    \"Certainly. I gave Alonzo a letter for you, which I had directed to your  boarding-house, and requested him to mail it. It contained a ten-dollar  bill.\"    \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46202"],[0,"A New Witness for God (Volume 1 of 3) (#16)"],[1,"  Of all the writers who have given us a description of the moral  condition of the church in the period of which I write, I think  Salvian, who wrote about the middle of the fifth century, is the most  vivid, and hence I quote in part his arraignment:    \"The very church which should be the body to appease the anger of God,  alas! what reigns there but disorders calculated to incense the Most  High? It is more common to meet with Christians who are guilty of the  greatest abominations than with those who are wholly exempt from crime.  So that today it is a sort of sanctity among us to be less vicious  than the generality of Christians. We insult the majesty of the Most  High at the foot of his altars. Men, the most steeped in crime, enter  the holy places without respect for them. True, all men ought to pay  their vows to God, but why should they seek his temples to propitiate  him, only to go forth to provoke him? Why enter the church to deplore  their former sins, and upon going forth--what do I say?--in those very  courts they commit fresh sins, their mouths and their hearts contradict  one another. Their prayers are criminal meditations rather than vows  of expiation. Scarcely is service ended before each returns to his old  practices. Some go to their wine, others to their impurities, still  others to robbing and brigandage, so that we cannot doubt that these  things had been occupying them while they were in the church. Nor is it  the lowest of the people who are thus guilty. There is no rank whatever  in the church which does not commit all sorts of crimes.    \"It may be urged that we are better at heart than the barbarians who  oppose us. Suppose this to be granted; we ought to be better than they.  But as a matter of fact, they are more virtuous than we. The mass of  Christians are below the barbarians in probity. True, all kinds of  sins are found among them; but what one is not found among us? The  several nations have their peculiar sin; the Saxons are cruel, the  Franks perfidious; the Gepidae inhuman; the Huns lewd. But we, having  the law of God to restrain us, are given over to all these offenses.  Then, to confine ourselves to the single sin of swearing, can many  be found among the faithful who have not the name of Jesus Christ  constantly upon their lips in support of their perjuries? This practice  coming down from the higher to the lower classes, has so prevailed  that Christians might be deemed pagans. This, although the law of God  expressly forbids to take his name in vain. We read this law; but we  do not practice it; as a consequence the pagans taunt us that we boast  ourselves the sole possessors of God's laws and of the rules of truth  and of what that law enjoins. 'Christians, indeed, to the shame of  Jesus Christ,' say they.\" [18]    In book VI. on _The Providence of God,_ Salvian continues his  arraignment: \"We rush from the churches to the theatres, even in the  midst of our perils. In Carthage the theatres were thronged while the  enemy were before the walls, and the cries of those perishing outside  under the sword mingled with the shouts of the spectators in the  circus. Nor are we better here in Gaul. Treves has been taken four  times, and has only increased in wickedness under her misfortunes. The  same state of things exists in Cologne--deplorable wickedness among  young and old, low and high. The smaller cities have been blind and  insensible to the dangers threatening, until they have overwhelmed  them. It seems to be the destiny of the Roman empire to perish rather  than reform; they must cease to be, in order to cease to be vicious.  A part of the inhabitants of Treves, having escaped from the ruins,  petitions the emperor for--what? A theatre, spectacles, public shows!  A city which thrice overthrown could not correct itself, well deserved  to suffer a fourth destruction. * * * Would that my voice might be  heard by all Romans! I would cry: Let us all blush that today the only  cities where impurity does not reign are those which have submitted to  the barbarians. Think not, then, that they conquer and we yield by the  simple force of nature. Rather let us admit that we succumb through  dissoluteness of our morals, of which our calamities are the just  punishment.\"    The moral condition of the church did not improve in the sixth nor the  seventh century. It kept getting worse and worse until in the tenth  century those writers most interested in upholding the purity of the  church declare that this was an iron age, barren of all goodness; a  leaden age, abounding in all wickedness; and a dark age, remarkable for  the scarcity of writers and men of learning. Christ is represented as  in a very deep sleep, the ship as covered with waves, and there were no  disciples who by their cries might wake him, being themselves asleep.  [19] \"Infidel Malice,\" says Milner, \"has with pleasure recorded the  vices and crimes of the popes of this century. Nor is it my intention  to attempt to palliate the account of their wickedness. It was as deep  and atrocious as language can paint; nor can a reasonable man desire  more authentic evidence of history than that which the records both of  civil and ecclesiastical history afford concerning the corruption of  the whole church.\" [20]    As already remarked, it is the contention of the Roman Catholic Church  that from Peter to Leo XIII. there has been an uninterrupted line  of bishops in the see of Rome who have held divine authority; who  succeeded both to the divine authority and mission of St. Peter; with  power to bind and loose on earth and in heaven; who were, in fact, the  vicars of Christ on earth, presidents of the church universal.    It now becomes my duty to refute that claim and give further proof  of the complete apostasy of the church by presenting the history of  the popes for three hundred years, from the middle of the eighth to  the middle of the eleventh century. I quote the sketch from Draper's  Intellectual Development of Europe:    \"On the death of Pope Paul I., who had attained the pontificate  A. D. 757, the Duke of Nepi compelled some bishops to consecrate  Constantine, one of his brothers, as pope; but more legitimate electors  subsequently, A. D. 768, choosing Stephen IV., the usurper and his  adherents were severely punished; the eyes of Constantine were put  out; the tongue of Bishop Theodorus was amputated, and he was left  in a dungeon to expire in the agonies of thirst. The nephews of Pope  Adrian seized his successor, Pope Leo III., A. D. 795, in the street,  and forcing him into a neighboring church, attempted to put out his  eyes and cut out his tongue; at a later period this pontiff trying to  suppress a conspiracy to depose him, Rome became a scene of rebellion,  murder and conflagration. His successor, Stephen V., A. D. 816, was  ignominiously driven from the city; his successor, Paschal I., was  accused of blinding and murdering two ecclesiastics in the Lateran  Palace; it was necessary that imperial commissioners should investigate  the matter, but the pope died, after having exculpated himself by  oath before thirty bishops. John VIII., A. D. 872, unable to resist  the Mohammedans, was compelled to pay them tribute; the Bishop of  Naples, maintaining a secret alliance with them, received his share  of the plunder they collected. Him John excommunicated, nor would he  give him absolution unless he would betray the chief Mohammedans and  assassinate others himself. There was an ecclesiastical conspiracy  to murder the pope; some of the treasures of the church were seized;  and the gate of St. Pancrazia was opened with false keys, to admit  the Saracens into the city. Formosus, who had been engaged in these  transactions, and excommunicated as a conspirator for the murder of  John, was subsequently elected pope, A. D. 891; he was succeeded by  Boniface VI., A. D. 896, who had been deposed from the diaconate, and  again from the priesthood, for his immoral and lewd life. By Stephen  VII., who followed, the dead body of Formosus was taken from the grave,  clothed in papal habiliaments, propped up in a chair, tried before a  council, and the preposterous and indecent scene completed by cutting  off three of the fingers of the corpse and casting it into the Tiber;  but Stephen himself was destined to exemplify how low the papacy had  fallen; he was thrown into prison and strangled. In the course of five  years from A. D. 896 to A. D. 900, five popes were consecrated. Leo  V., who succeeded in A. D. 904, was in less than two months thrown  into prison by Christopher, one of his chaplains, who usurped his  place, and who, in his turn, was shortly expelled from Rome by Sergius  III., who, by the aid of a military force, seized the pontificate, A.  D. 905. This man, according to the testimony of the times, lived in  a criminal intercourse with the celebrated prostitute Theodora, who,  with her daughters Marozia and Theodora, also prostitutes, exercised an  extraordinary control over him. The love of Theodora was also shared  by John X.: she gave him the first arch-bishopric of Ravenna, and then  translated him to Rome, A. D. 915, as pope. John was not unsuited to  the times; he organized a confederacy which perhaps prevented Rome  from being captured by the Saracens, and the world was astonished and  edified by the appearance of this warlike pontiff at the head of his  troops. By the love of Theodora, as was said, he maintained himself  in the papacy for fourteen years; by the intrigues and hatred of  her daughter, Marozia, he was overthrown. She surprised him in the  Lateran palace; killed his brother Peter before his face; threw him  into prison, where he soon died, smothered, as was asserted, with a  pillow. After a short interval Marozia made her own son pope as John  XI., A. D. 931. Many affirmed that Pope Sergius was his father, but  she herself inclined to attribute him to her husband Alberic, whose "]]]
