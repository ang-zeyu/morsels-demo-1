[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5761"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 2 (#16)"],[1,"accompanied by his nephew, Manbuku Prata (pronounced Pelata), the  \"Silver Chief Officer,\" as we might say, Golden Ball. The title  is vulgarly written Mambuco; the Abbé Proyart prefers Ma-nboukou,  or \"prince who is below the Makaia in dignity.\" The native name  of this third personage was Gidifuku. It was a gorgeous  dignitary: from the poll of his night-cap protruded a dozen  bristles of elephant's tail hair, to which a terminal coral gave  the graceful curve of a pintado's crest, and along his ears, like  the flaps of a travelling casquette, hung two dingy little  mirrors of talc from Cacongo, set in clumsy frames of ruddled  wood. Masses of coral encircled his neck, and the full-dress  naval uniform of a French officer, with epaulettes of stupendous  size, exposed a zebra'd guernsey of equivocal purity. A long  black staff, studded with broad-headed brass beads, served to  clear the room of the lieges, who returned as fast as they were  turned out--the baton was evidently not intended to be used  seriously.    But the Manbuku Prata is not a mere \"Punch in a puppet show.\" His  face expresses more intelligence and resolution than usual, and  his Portuguese is not the vile article of the common trader. He  means business. When other chiefs send their \"sons,\" that is  their slaves, to fight, he leads them in person--venite, non ite.  The French \"Emigration Libre\" put 30,000 dollars into his pocket,  and he still hopes against hope to ship many a cargo for the  Banana factory. He has some 300 armed serviles at Chinímí and  Lámbá, two villages perched like condors' nests upon hills  commanding the river's northern bank, and, despite the present  dearth of \"business,\" he still owns some 100,000 francs in cloth  and beads, rum and gunpowder.    As the \"Silver Minister\" took his seat upon the ground before the  king, all removed their caps with a simultaneous grunt and  performed the \"Sákilá\" or batta-palmas; this hand-clapping must  be repeated whenever the simplest action is begun or ended by  king or chief. Monteiro and Gamitto (pp. 101 et seg.) refer to  the practice everywhere on the line of country which they  visited: there it seems to be even a more ceremonious affair than  in the Congo. The claps were successively less till they were  hardly audible; after a pause five or six were given, and the  last two or three were in hurried time, the while without  pronouncing a word. The palaver now opened steadily with a drink:  a bottle of trade \"fizz\" was produced for the white man, and rum  for his black congeners; then the compliment of healths went all  round. After this we fell to work at business. By dint of  abundant wrangling and with an immense display of suspicion,  natural under the circumstances, it was arranged that the king  should forward me in a couple of his own canoes to Banza Nokki,  the end of river navigation, as we were told, and falsely told;  in my turn I was to pay goods valued about £6, at least three  times the usual tariff. They consisted of fourteen red caps, as  many \"sashes,\" and fifty-two fathoms of cloth for the crew; ten  Peças de lei or Chiloes for each interpreter, and two pieces for  the canoes. I should have given four fathoms for each man and the  same for each boat. The final scene was most gratifying to the  African mind: I solemnly invested old Nessala with the grand  cloak which covered his other finery; grinning in the ecstasy of  vanity, he allowed his subjects to turn him round and round, as  one would a lay figure, yet with profound respect, and, lastly,  he retired to charm his wives.    This part of the negotiations ended with presenting some \"satin  stripe\" and rum to the Nchinu and Manbuku Prata, and with shaking  hands--a dangerous operation. The people are cleanly; they wash  when rising, and before as well as after every meal; they are  always bathing, yet from prince to pauper, from baby to grey  beard, they are affected with a psora known by its Portuguese  name, \"sarnas.\" The Congo \"fiddle\" appears first between the  articulations of the fingers, and bleaches the hands and wrists  as if it were leprosy. Yet I did not see a single case of true  lepra Arabum, or its modifications, the huge Barbadoes leg  (elephantiasis), and the sarcoma scrotale and sarcocele of  Zanzibar and East Africa. From the extremities the gale extends  over the body, especially the shins, and the people, who appear  in the perpetual practice of scalpturigo, attribute it to the  immoderate use of palm wine. I observed, however, that Europeans,  in the river, who avoid the liquor, are hardly ever free from  this foul blood-poison, and a jar of sulphur mixture is a common  article upon the table. Hydrocele is not unfrequent, but hardly  so general as in the Eastern Island; one manner of white man, a  half caste from Macáo, was suffering with serpigo, and boasted of  it.    All predicted to me a similar fate from the \"botch of Congo,\" but  happily I escaped. Indeed, throughout the West African Coast,  travellers risk \"craw-craw,\" a foul form of the disease, seen on  board the African steamers. Kru-men touching the rails of the  companion ladders, have communicated it to passengers, and these  to their wives and families.    The town was neat and clean as the people. The houses were built  upon raised platforms, and in the little fenced fields the  Cajanus Indicus vetch was conspicuous. In Hindostani it is called  Thur, or Doll-plant, by the Eastern Arab Turiyan, in Kisawahili  Mbarazi, in Angola voando (Merolla's Ouuanda), and in the Brazil  Guandu.[FN#9] The people had lost their fear, and brought their  exomphalous little children, who resembled salmon fry in the  matter of umbilical vesicles, to be patted by the white man; a  process which caused violent screams and in some cases nearly  induced convulsions-- the mothers seemed to enjoy the horror  displayed by their hopefuls. There is little beauty amongst the  women, and settled Europeans prefer Cabinda girls. The latter  have perhaps the most wiry and wig-like hair on the whole West  African coast, where all hair is more or less wiry and wig- like.  Cloth was less abundant in the village than a smear of red; the  bosom even after marriage was unveiled, and the rule of fashion  was shown by binding it tightly down. The rich wore armlets and  leglets of staircase rods, brass and copper, like the metal  gaiters and gauntlets of the Gaboon River. The only remarkable  object was the Quesango, a wooden effigy of a man placed in the  middle of the settlement: Battel mentions it amongst the \"Gagas  or Guides,\" and Barbot terms it \"Likoku Mokisi.\" Three faint  hurrahs, a feeble African echo of England like the \"hoch!\" of  Vienna, and the discharge of a four- pounder were our parting  honours.    We returned viâ the gateway between the two islets. On the south-  eastern flank of Chisalla is a dwarf precipice called Mbondo la  Zumba and, according to the interpreters, it is the Lovers' Leap  of Tuckey. But its office must not be confounded with that  attributed to the sinister-looking scaur of Leucadia; here the  erring wives of the Kings of Boma and their paramours found a  Bosphorus. The Commander of the First Congo Expedition applies  the name to a hanging rock on the northern shore, about eighteen  miles higher up stream. A portentous current soon swept us past  Père la Chaise, and shortly after noon we were comfortably at  breakfast with Sr. Pereira.    During the last night we had been kept awake by the drumming and  fifing, singing and shouting, weeping and howling, pulling at  accordions and striking the monotonous Shingungo. Merolla names  this cymbal Longa, and describes it justly as two iron bells  joined by an arched bar: I found it upon the Tanganyika Lake, and  suffered severely from its monotonous horrors. Monteiro and  Gamitto (p. 232) give an illustration of what is known in the  Cazembe's country as \"Gomati:\" The Mchua or gong-gong of Ashanti  has a wooden handle connecting the cones. Our palhabote had  brought up the chief Mashel's bier, and to-day we have the  satisfaction of seeing it landed. A kind of palanquin, covered  with crimson cloth and tinsel gold like a Bombay \"Tabút,\" it had  three horns or prominences, two capped with empty black bottles,  and the central bearing the deceased's helmet; it was a fancy  article, which might have fitted him of Gath, with a terrific  plume and the spoils of three horses in the sanguine hues of war.  Although eight feet long by five broad, the coffin was said to be  quite full. The immense respect which the Congoese bear to their  rulers, dead as well as alive, prevented my verifying the  accounts of the slave dealers. I knew that the chief who had died  at Kinsembo, had been dried on a bamboo scaffolding over a slow  fire, and lay in state for some weeks in flannel stockings and a  bale of baize, but these regions abound in local variations of  custom. Some declared, as we find in Proyart, that the corpse had  been mummified by the rude process of smoking; others that it had  been exposed for some days to the open air, the relatives sitting  round to keep off the flies till preliminarily bandaged.  According to Barbot (iii. 23), the people of Fetu on the Gold  Coast and the men of Benin used to toast the corpse on a wooden  gridiron; and the Vei tribe, like the Congoese, still fumigate  their dead bodies till they become like dried hams. This rude  form of the Egyptian rite is known to East as well as to West  Africa: Kimera, late King of Uganda, was placed upon a board  covering the mouth of a huge earthern pot heated from below.    Instances are known of bodies in the Congo region remaining a  year or two above ground till the requisite quantity of fine  stuffs has been procured--the larger the roll the greater the  dignity, and sometimes the hut must be pulled down before it can  be removed. Here, as on the Gold Coast, we find the Jewish  practice recorded by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5767"],[0,"The Fireside Chats of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (#16)"],[1,"have provided a Court  well-balanced as to age.  But chance and the disinclination of  individuals to leave the Supreme bench have now given us a Court in  which five justices will be over seventy-five years of age before  next June and one over seventy.  Thus a sound public policy has been  defeated.    I now propose that we establish by law an assurance against any  such ill-balanced court in the future.  I propose that hereafter,  when a judge reaches the age of seventy, a new and younger judge  shall be added to the court automatically.  In this way I propose to  enforce a sound public policy by law instead of leaving the  composition of our federal courts, including the highest, to be  determined by chance or the personal indecision of individuals.    If such a law as I propose is regarded as establishing a new  precedent, is it not a most desirable precedent?    Like all lawyers, like all Americans, I regret the necessity of  this controversy.  But the welfare of the United States, and indeed  of the Constitution itself, is what we all must think about first.  Our difficulty with the Court today rises not from the Court as an  institution but from human beings within it.  But we cannot yield  our constitutional destiny to the personal judgment of a few men  who, being fearful of the future, would deny us the necessary means  of dealing with the present.    This plan of mine is no attack on the Court; it seeks to restore  the Court to its rightful and historic place in our constitutional  government and to have it resume its high task of building anew on  the Constitution \"a system of living law.\"  The Court itself can  best undo what the Court has done.    I have thus explained to you the reasons that lie behind our  efforts to secure results by legislation within the Constitution.  I  hope that thereby the difficult process of constitutional amendment  may be rendered unnecessary.  But let us examine the process.    There are many types of amendment proposed.  Each one is radically  different from the other.  There is no substantial groups within the  Congress or outside it who are agreed on any single amendment.    It would take months or years to get substantial agreement upon the  type and language of the amendment.  It would take months and years  thereafter to get a two-thirds majority in favor of that amendment  in _both_ Houses of the Congress.    Then would come the long course of ratification by three-fourths of  all the states.  No amendment which any powerful economic interests  or the leaders of any powerful political party have had reason to  oppose has ever been ratified within anything like a reasonable  time.  And thirteen states which contain only five percent of the  voting population can block ratification even though the thirty-  five states with ninety-five percent of the population are in favor  of it.    A very large percentage of newspaper publishers, Chambers of  Commerce, Bar Association, Manufacturers' Associations, who are  trying to give the impression that they really do want a  constitutional amendment would be the first to exclaim as soon as  an amendment was proposed, \"Oh!  I was for an amendment all right,  but this amendment you proposed is not the kind of amendment that I  was thinking about.  I am therefore, going to spend my time, my  efforts and my money to block the amendment, although I would be  awfully glad to help get some other kind of amendment ratified.\"    Two groups oppose my plan on the ground that they favor a  constitutional amendment.  The first includes those who  fundamentally object to social and economic legislation along  modern lines.  This is the same group who during the campaign last  Fall tried to block the mandate of the people.    Now they are making a last stand.  And the strategy of that last  stand is to suggest the time-consuming process of amendment in  order to kill off by delay the legislation demanded by the mandate.    To them I say:  I do not think you will be able long to fool the  American people as to your purposes.    The other groups is composed of those who honestly believe the  amendment process is the best and who would be willing to support a  reasonable amendment if they could agree on one.    To them I say:  we cannot rely on an amendment as the immediate or  only answer to our present difficulties.  When the time comes for  action, you will find that many of those who pretend to support you  will sabotage any constructive amendment which is proposed.  Look at  these strange bed-fellows of yours.  When before have you found them  really at your side in your fights for progress?    And remember one thing more.  Even if an amendment were passed, and  even if in the years to come it were to be ratified, its meaning  would depend upon the kind of justices who would be sitting on the  Supreme Court bench.  An amendment, like the rest of the  Constitution, is what the justices say it is rather than what its  framers or you might hope it is.    This proposal of mine will not infringe in the slightest upon the  civil or religious liberties so dear to every American.    My record as Governor and President proves my devotion to those  liberties.  You who know me can have no fear that I would tolerate  the destruction by any branch of government of any part of our  heritage of freedom.    The present attempt by those opposed to progress to play upon the  fears of danger to personal liberty brings again to mind that crude  and cruel strategy tried by the same opposition to frighten the  workers of America in a pay-envelope propaganda against the Social  Security Law.  The workers were not fooled by that propaganda then.  The people of America will not be fooled by such propaganda now.    I am in favor of action through legislation:    First, because I believe that it can be passed at this session of  the Congress.    Second, because it will provide a reinvigorated, liberal-minded  judiciary necessary to furnish quicker and cheaper justice from  bottom to top.    Third, because it will provide a series of federal courts willing  to enforce the Constitution as written, and unwilling to assert  legislative powers by writing into it their own political and  economic policies.    During the past half century the balance of power between the three  great branches of the federal government, has been tipped out of  balance by the courts in direct contradiction of the high purposes  of the framers of the Constitution.  It is my purpose to restore  that balance.  You who know me will accept my solemn assurance that  in a world in which democracy is under attack, I seek to make  American democracy succeed.  You and I will do our part.        October 12, 1937.      My Friends:    This afternoon I have issued a Proclamation calling a special  session of the Congress to convene on Monday, November 15, 1937.    I do this in order to give to the Congress an opportunity to  consider important legislation before the regular session in  January, and to enable the Congress to avoid a lengthy session next  year, extending through the summer.    I know that many enemies of democracy will say that it is bad for  business, bad for the tranquility of the country, to have a special  session--even one beginning only six weeks before the regular  session.  But I have never had sympathy with the point of view that  a session of the Congress is an unfortunate intrusion of what they  call \"politics\" into our national affairs.  Those who do not like  democracy want to keep legislators at home.  But the Congress is an  essential instrument of democratic government; and democratic  government can never be considered an intruder into the affairs of  a democratic nation.    I shall ask this special session to consider immediately certain  important legislation which my recent trip through the nation  convinces me the American people immediately need.  This does not  mean that other legislation, to which I am not referring tonight,  is not important for our national well-being.  But other legislation  can be more readily discussed at the regular session.    Anyone charged with proposing or judging national policies should  have first-hand knowledge of the nation as a whole.    That is why again this year I have taken trips to all parts of the  country.  Last spring I visited the Southwest.  This summer I made  several trips in the East.  Now I am just back from a trip from a  trip all the way across the continent, and later this autumn I hope  to pay my annual visit to the Southeast.    For a President especially it is a duty to think in national terms.    He must think not only of this year but of future years, when  someone else will be President.    He must look beyond the average of the prosperity and well-being of  the country, for averages easily cover up danger spots of poverty  and instability.    He must not let the country be deceived by a merely temporary  prosperity which depends on wasteful exploitation of resources  which cannot last.    He must think not only of keeping us out of war today, but also of  keeping us out of war in generations to come.    The kind of prosperity we want is the sound and permanent kind  which is not built up temporarily at the expense of any section or  any group.  And the kind of peace we want is the sound and permanent  kind, which is built on the cooperative search for peace by all the  nations which want peace.    The other day I was asked to state my outstanding impression gained  on this recent trip.  I said that it seemed to me to be the general  understanding on the part of the average citizen of the broad  objectives and policies which I have just outlined.    Five years of fierce discussion and debate--five years of  information through the radio and the moving picture--have taken  the whole nation to school in the nation's business.  Even those who  have most attacked our objectives have, by their very"]]]
