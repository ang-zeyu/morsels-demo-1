Biol. Soc.      Washington, 52:93, June 5, 1939.    _Type._--Adult male, skin and skull; No. 5053, Los Angeles Museum of  History, Science and Art, obtained on November 3, 1938, by Jack C. von  Bloeker, Jr., from salt marsh at mouth of Elkhorn Slough, Moss  Landing, Monterey Co., California, original no. 9456.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the species; average and extreme  measurements of 6 topotypes are: total length, 115 (113-118); tail,  46.5 (42-48); hind foot, 14.5 (14-15) (von Bloeker, 1939:94). In  winter nearly black dorsally, deep mouse gray ventrally; in summer  nearly as dark dorsally as in winter, hairs of venter tipped with  Clove Brown; skull short, relatively broad cranially and relatively  narrow rostrally.    _Comparisons._--For comparison with _S. v. halicoetes_ see account of  that subspecies.    _Remarks._--This subspecies, occurring at the limits of the range of  the species, is uncommon in most collections. Seven specimens were  available for the original description. The summer pelage is not  completely described in the original description, but is stated to be  darker than the winter pelage of _S. v. vagrans_, and must thus be  considerably darker than the summer pelage of _S. v. halicoetes_. Two  specimens in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, from San Gregario,  referred by Jackson to _S. v. halicoetes_, were included in the  present subspecies by von Bloeker.    _Specimens examined._--None.    _Records of occurrence_ (von Bloeker, 1939:94).--CALIFORNIA: _San  Mateo Co._: San Gregario. _Monterey Co._: Seaside; mouth of Salinas  River; Moss Landing.    _Marginal records._--CALIFORNIA: San Gregario; Seaside.      =Sorex vagrans vancouverensis= Merriam       _Sorex vancouverensis_ Merriam, N.

Coll.; obtained on May 10, 1895, by Clark P. Streator, from  Goldstream, Vancouver Island, British Columbia.    _Range._--Vancouver Island from Sayward south, and Bowen Island.    _Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; average and extreme  measurements of 6 specimens from Alberni Valley, Vancouver Island,  are: total length, 106.5 (97-115); tail, 41.7 (40-43); hind foot, 12  (11-13) (Jackson, 1928:107). Ventral parts brownish, winter pelage  reddish brown rather than grayish.    _Comparisons._--Differs from _S. v. vagrans_ in more brownish ventral  parts and more brownish, rather than grayish, winter pelage; differs  from the sympatric _S. v. isolatus_ in shorter tail, shorter hind  foot, more narrow skull, and smaller teeth.    _Remarks._--This is a poorly differentiated subspecies which is  closely related to _S. v. vagrans_. The differences in color noted are  average ones. Some individuals of this shrew might be difficult to  separate from _S. v. isolatus_. The slight degree of morphological  divergence is such that intergrades might be expected to occur.  Possibly some habitat separation occurs, but such has not been  reported.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 3. BRITISH COLUMBIA: Vancouver  Island: Mt.

CONCLUSIONS      1. _Sorex vagrans_, _S. obscurus_, _S. pacificus_, and _S. yaquinae_  are conspecific with one another. Each is a valid subspecies but all  should bear the specific name _Sorex vagrans_ Baird, 1858.    2. The subspecies of _Sorex vagrans_ form a cline from large  (_pacificus_) to small (_vagrans_). The cline is bent in such a manner  that the terminal subspecies occur together. Where the two subspecies  occur together, individuals of one subspecies do not crossbreed with  individuals of the other subspecies and therefore react toward one  another as do full species. _Sorex vagrans vagrans_ occurs  sympatrically with _S. v. sonomae_, _S. v. pacificus_, _S. v.  yaquinae_, _S. v. bairdi_, _S. v. permiliensis_, and _S. v. setosus_.  _S. v. vancouverensis_ occurs sympatrically with _S. v. isolatus_.    3. The sympatric existence of the terminal subspecies of the _Sorex  vagrans_ rassenkreis is made possible by marked differences between  them in size and in ecological preference.    4. The west-coast subspecies, _sonomae_, _pacificus_, _yaquinae_,  _bairdi_, and _permiliensis_ probably differentiated from the Great  Basin and Rocky Mountain subspecies, _vagrans_, _obscurus_ and  _monticola_, during a separation caused first by aridity in the Great  Basin, and secondly by glaciation of the Cascade Mountains and the  Sierra Nevada, possibly in the Sangamonian and Wisconsinan ages  respectively.    5. _Sorex v. vagrans_ originated in the Great Basin and arrived on the  Pacific Coast after the last deglaciation of the Cascades and Sierra  Nevada.    6. In _S. vagrans_, heterogonic growth is illustrated; the larger the  skull, the larger the rostrum in proportion to the skull as a whole.    7. In the species _S. vagrans_, size and color vary geographically  more than do other features.    8. The _S. ornatus_ group, _S. longirostris_, and _S. veraepacis_ had  a common ancestor with _S. vagrans_, possibly in the Illinoian Age.    9. _S. vagrans_, the _S. ornatus_ group, _S. veraepacis_, _S.  longirostris_, _S. palustris_, _S. bendiri_, and the _S. cinereus_  group, because of structural resemblances, should be placed in a  single subgenus, _Otisorex_. _S. trowbridgii_, the _S. arcticus_ group,  the _S. saussurei_ group, _S. merriami_, _S. fumeus_, and _S. dispar_,  should be included in the subgenus _Sorex_.    10. _Sorex cinereus_ occurs with the medium-sized and large-sized _S.  vagrans_ in the Rocky Mountains and in Canada, but does not occur with  the smaller subspecies of _S. vagrans_, probably because competition  between two shrews of like size excludes _S. cinereus_.

I would not permit any European to go  with me, but two of the home-guard (Southern) Indian men were to  accompany me as before. Indeed the Indians, both Northern and Southern,  paid so little attention to Isbester and Merriman on my former journey,  particularly in times of scarcity, that I was determined not to take  them with me in future; though the former was very desirous to accompany  me again, and was well calculated to encounter the hardships of {13}  such an undertaking. Merriman was quite sick of such excursions, and so  far from offering his service a second time, seemed to be very thankful  that he was once more arrived in safety among his friends; for before he  got to the Factory he had contracted a most violent cold.    Having come to the above resolutions, and finally determined on the  number of Indians that were to accompany us, we were again fitted out  with a large supply of ammunition, and as many other useful articles as  we could conveniently take with us, together with a small sample of  light trading goods, for presents to the Indians, as before.    [Sidenote: 1770. February.]    My instructions on this occasion amounted to no more than an order to  proceed as fast as possible; and for my conduct during the journey, I  was referred to my former instructions of November 6th, 1769.    [Sidenote: 23rd.]    Every thing being in readiness for our departure, on the twenty-third of  February I began my second journey, accompanied by three Northern  Indians and two of the home-guard (Southern) Indians. I took particular  care, however, that Mackachy, though an excellent hunter, should not be  of our party; as he had proved himself, during my former journey, to be  a sly artful villain.    The snow at this time was so deep on the top of the ramparts, that few  of the cannon were to be seen, {14} otherwise the Governor would have  saluted me at my departure, as before; but as those honours could not  possibly be of any service to my expedition, I readily relinquished  everything of the kind; and in lieu of it, the Governor, officers, and  people, insisted on giving me three cheers.    After leaving the Factory, we continued our course in much the same  direction as in my former journey, till we arrived at Seal River; when,  instead of crossing it, and walking on the barren grounds as before, we  followed the course of the river, except in two particular places, where  the bends tended so much to the South, that by crossing two necks of  land not more than five or six miles wide, we saved the walking of near  twenty miles each time, and still came to the main river again.    [Sidenote: 1770. March. 8th.]    The weather had been so remarkably boisterous and changeable, that we  were frequently obliged to continue two or three nights in the same  place. To make up for this inconveniency, deer were so plentiful for the  first eight or ten days, that the Indians killed as many as was  necessary; but we were all so heavy laden that we could not possibly  take much of the meat with us. This I soon perceived to be a great evil,  which exposed us to such frequent inconveniences, that in case of not  killing any thing for three or four days together, we were in great  want of provisions; we seldom, however, went to bed entirely supperless  {15} till the eighth of March; when though we had only walked about  eight miles that morning, and expended all the remainder of the day in  hunting, we could not produce a single thing at night, not even a  partridge! nor had we discerned the track of any thing that day, which  was likely to afford us hopes of better success in the morning. This  being the case, we prepared some hooks and lines ready to angle for  fish, as our tent was then by the side of a lake belonging to Seal  River, which seemed by its situation to afford some prospect of success.    [Sidenote: 9th.]    Early in the morning we took down our tent, and moved about five miles  to the West by South, to a part of the lake that seemed more commodious  for fishing than that where we had been the night before. As soon as we  arrived at this place, some were immediately employed cutting holes in  the ice, while others pitched the tent, got fire-wood, &c.; after which,  for it was early in the morning, those who pitched the tent went a  hunting, and at night one of them returned with a porcupine,[28] while  those who were angling caught several fine trout, which afforded us a  plentiful supper, and we had some trifle left for breakfast.    Angling for fish under the ice in winter requires no other process, than  cutting round holes in the ice from one to two feet diameter, and  letting down a baited hook, which is always kept in motion, not only to  {16} prevent the water from freezing so soon as it would do if suffered  to remain quite still, but because it is found at the same time to be a  great means of alluring the fish to the hole; for it is always observed  that the fish in those parts will take a bait which is in motion, much  sooner than one that is at rest.    [Sidenote: 19th.]    [Sidenote: 1770. March.]    [Sidenote: 20th.]    Early in the morning we again pursued our angling, and all the forenoon  being expended without any success, we took down our tent and pitched it  again about eight miles farther to the Westward, on the same lake, where  we cut more holes in the ice for angling, and that night caught several  fine pike.[29] The next day we moved about five miles to the South West,  down a small river, where we pitched our tent; and having set four  fishing nets, in the course of the day we caught many fine fish,  particularly pike, trout,[30] tittymeg, and a coarse kind of fish known  in Hudson's Bay by the name of Methy.[31][S]    To set a net under the ice, it is first necessary to ascertain its exact  length, by stretching it out upon the ice near the part proposed for  setting it. This being done, a number of round holes are cut in the ice,  at ten or twelve feet distance from each other, and as many in number as  will be sufficient to stretch the net at its full length. A line is then  passed under the ice, by means {17} of a long light pole, which is first  introduced at one of the end holes, and, by means of two forked sticks,  this pole is easily conducted, or passed from one hole to another, under  the ice, till it arrives at the last. The pole is then taken out, and  both ends of the line being properly secured, is always ready for use.  The net is made fast to one end of the line by one person, and hauled  under the ice by a second; a large stone is tied to each of the lower  corners, which serves to keep the net expanded, and prevents it rising  from the bottom with every waft of the current. The Europeans settled in  Hudson's Bay proceed much in the same manner, though they in general  take much more pains; but the above method is found quite sufficient by  the Indians.    In order to search a net thus set, the two end holes only are opened;  the line is veered away by one person, and the net hauled from under the  ice by another; after all the fish are taken out, the net is easily  hauled back to its former station, and there secured as before.    [Sidenote: 1770. March. 21st.]    As this place seemed likely to afford us a constant supply of fish, my  guide proposed to stay here till the geese began to fly, which in those  Northern parts is seldom before the middle of May. His reasons for so  doing seemed well founded: \"The weather,\" he said, \"is at this time too  cold to walk on the barren grounds, and the woods from this part lead so  much {18} to the Westward, that were we to continue travelling in any  tolerable shelter, our course would not be better than West South West,  which would only be going out of our way; whereas, if we should remain  here till the weather permit us to walk due North, over the barren  grounds, we shall then in one month get farther advanced on our journey,  than if we were to continue travelling all the remainder of the winter  in the sweep of the woods.\"    These reasons appeared to me very judicious, and as the plan seemed  likely to be attended with little trouble, it met with my entire  approbation. That being the case, we took additional pains in building  our tent, and made it as commodious as the materials and situation would  admit.    [Sidenote: 1770. March.]    To pitch an Indian's tent in winter, it is first necessary to search for  a level piece of dry ground; which cannot be ascertained but by  thrusting a stick through the snow down to the ground, all over the  proposed part. When a convenient spot is found, the snow is then cleared  away in a circular form to the very moss; and when it is proposed to  remain more than a night or two in one place, the moss is also cut up  and removed, as it is very liable when dry to take fire, and occasion  much trouble to the inhabitants. A quantity of poles are then procured,  which are generally proportioned both in number and length to the {19}  size of the tent cloth, and the number of persons it is intended to  contain. If one of the poles should not happen to be forked, two of them  are tied together near the top, then raised erect, and their buts or  lower ends extended as wide as the proposed diameter of the tent; the  other poles are then set round at equal distances from each other, and  in such order, that their lower ends form a complete circle, which gives  boundaries to the tent on all sides: the tent cloth is then fastened to  a light pole, which is always raised up and put round the poles from the  weather side, so that the two edges that lap over and form the door are  always to the leeward. It must be understood that this method is only in  use when the Indians are moving from place to place every day; for when  they intend to continue any time in one place,"]]]
