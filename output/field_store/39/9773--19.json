[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37206"],[0,"Sea and Sardinia (#16)"],[1," on? Shall we go forward?    There are two ways of leaving Cagliari for the north: the State railway  that runs up the west side of the island, and the narrow-gauge secondary  railway that pierces the centre. But we are too late for the big trains.  So we will go by the secondary railway, wherever it goes.    There is a train at 2.30, and we can get as far as Mandas, some fifty  miles in the interior. When we tell the queer little waiter at the  hotel, he says he comes from Mandas, and there are two inns. So after  lunch--a strictly fish menu--we pay our bill. It comes to sixty odd  francs--for three good meals each, with wine, and the night's lodging,  this is cheap, as prices now are in Italy.    Pleased with the simple and friendly Scala di Ferre, I shoulder my sack  and we walk off to the second station. The sun is shining hot this  afternoon--burning hot, by the sea. The road and the buildings look dry  and desiccated, the harbour rather weary and end of the world.    There is a great crowd of peasants at the little station. And almost  every man has a pair of woven saddle-bags--a great flat strip of  coarse-woven wool, with flat pockets at either end, stuffed with  purchases. These are almost the only carrying bags. The men sling them  over their shoulder, so that one great pocket hangs in front, one  behind.    These saddle bags are most fascinating. They are coarsely woven in bands  of raw black-rusty wool, with varying bands of raw white wool or hemp or  cotton--the bands and stripes of varying widths going cross-wise. And on  the pale bands are woven sometimes flowers in most lovely colours,  rose-red and blue and green, peasant patterns--and sometimes fantastic  animals, beasts, in dark wool again. So that these striped zebra bags,  some wonderful gay with flowery colours on their stripes, some weird  with fantastic, griffin-like animals, are a whole landscape in  themselves.    The train has only first and third class. It costs about thirty francs  for the two of us, third class to Mandas, which is some sixty miles. In  we crowd with the joyful saddle-bags, into the wooden carriage with its  many seats.    And, wonder of wonders, punctually to the second, off we go, out of  Cagliari. En route again.          IV.    MANDAS.      The coach was fairly full of people, returning from market. On these  railways the third class coaches are not divided into compartments. They  are left open, so that one sees everybody, as down a room. The  attractive saddle-bags, _bercole_, were disposed anywhere, and the bulk  of the people settled down to a lively _conversazione_. It is much  nicest, on the whole, to travel third class on the railway. There is  space, there is air, and it is like being in a lively inn, everybody in  good spirits.    At our end was plenty of room. Just across the gangway was an elderly  couple, like two children, coming home very happily. He was fat, fat all  over, with a white moustache and a little not-unamiable frown. She was a  tall lean, brown woman, in a brown full-skirted dress and black apron,  with huge pocket. She wore no head covering, and her iron grey hair was  parted smoothly. They were rather pleased and excited being in the  train. She took all her money out of her big pocket, and counted it and  gave it to him: all the ten Lira notes, and the five Lira and the two  and the one, peering at the dirty scraps of pink-backed one-lira notes  to see if they were good. Then she gave him her half-pennies. And he  stowed them away in the trouser pocket, standing up to push them down  his fat leg. And then one saw, to one's amazement, that the whole of his  shirt-tail was left out behind, like a sort of apron worn backwards.  Why--a mystery. He was one of those fat, good-natured, unheeding men  with a little masterful frown, such as usually have tall, lean,  hard-faced, obedient wives.    They were very happy. With amazement he watched us taking hot tea from  the Thermos flask. I think he too had suspected it might be a bomb. He  had blue eyes and standing-up white eyebrows.    \"Beautiful hot--!\" he said, seeing the tea steam. It is the inevitable  exclamation. \"Does it do you good?\"    \"Yes,\" said the q-b. \"Much good.\" And they both nodded complacently.  They were going home.           *       *       *       *       *    The train was running over the malarial-looking sea-plain--past the  down-at-heel palm trees, past the mosque-looking buildings. At a level  crossing the woman crossing-keeper darted out vigorously with her red  flag. And we rambled into the first village. It was built of sun-dried  brick-adobe houses, thick adobe garden-walls, with tile ridges to keep  off the rain. In the enclosures were dark orange trees. But the  clay-coloured villages, clay-dry, looked foreign: the next thing to mere  earth they seem, like fox-holes or coyote colonies.    Looking back, one sees Cagliari bluff on her rock, rather fine, with the  thin edge of the sea's blade curving round. It is rather hard to believe  in the real sea, on this sort of clay-pale plain.           *       *       *       *       *    But soon we begin to climb to the hills. And soon the cultivation begins  to be intermittent. Extraordinary how the heathy, moor-like hills come  near the sea: extraordinary how scrubby and uninhabited the great spaces  of Sardinia are. It is wild, with heath and arbutus scrub and a sort of  myrtle, breast-high. Sometimes one sees a few head of cattle. And then  again come the greyish arable-patches, where the corn is grown. It is  like Cornwall, like the Land's End region. Here and there, in the  distance, are peasants working on the lonely landscape. Sometimes it is  one man alone in the distance, showing so vividly in his black-and-white  costume, small and far-off like a solitary magpie, and curiously  distinct. All the strange magic of Sardinia is in this sight. Among the  low, moor-like hills, away in a hollow of the wide landscape one  solitary figure, small but vivid black-and-white, working alone, as if  eternally. There are patches and hollows of grey arable land, good for  corn. Sardinia was once a great granary.    Usually, however, the peasants of the South have left off the costume.  Usually it is the invisible soldiers' grey-green cloth, the Italian  khaki. Wherever you go, wherever you be, you see this khaki, this  grey-green war-clothing. How many millions of yards of the thick,  excellent, but hateful material the Italian government must have  provided I don't know: but enough to cover Italy with a felt carpet, I  should think. It is everywhere. It cases the tiny children in stiff and  neutral frocks and coats, it covers their extinguished fathers, and  sometimes it even encloses the women in its warmth. It is symbolic of  the universal grey mist that has come over men, the extinguishing of all  bright individuality, the blotting out of all wild singleness. Oh  democracy! Oh khaki democracy!           *       *       *       *       *    This is very different from Italian landscape. Italy is almost always  dramatic, and perhaps invariably romantic. There is drama in the plains  of Lombardy, and romance in the Venetian lagoons, and sheer scenic  excitement in nearly all the hilly parts of the peninsula. Perhaps it is  the natural floridity of lime-stone formations. But Italian landscape is  really eighteenth-century landscape, to be represented in that  romantic-classic manner which makes everything rather marvelous and very  topical: aqueducts, and ruins upon sugar-loaf mountains, and craggy  ravines and Wilhelm Meister water-falls: all up and down.    Sardinia is another thing. Much wider, much more ordinary, not  up-and-down at all, but running away into the distance. Unremarkable  ridges of moor-like hills running away, perhaps to a bunch of dramatic  peaks on the southwest. This gives a sense of space, which is so lacking  in Italy. Lovely space about one, and traveling distances--nothing  finished, nothing final. It is like liberty itself, after the peaky  confinement of Sicily. Room--give me room--give me room for my spirit:  and you can have all the toppling crags of romance.    So we ran on through the gold of the afternoon, across a wide, almost  Celtic landscape of hills, our little train winding and puffing away  very nimbly. Only the heath and scrub, breast-high, man-high, is too big  and brigand-like for a Celtic land. The horns of black, wild-looking  cattle show sometimes.    After a long pull, we come to a station after a stretch of loneliness.  Each time, it looks as if there were nothing beyond--no more  habitations. And each time we come to a station.    Most of the people have left the train. And as with men driving in a  gig, who get down at every public-house, so the passengers usually  alight for an airing at each station. Our old fat friend stands up and  tucks his shirt-tail comfortably in his trousers, which trousers all the  time make one hold one's breath, for they seem at each very moment to be  just dropping right down: and he clambers out, followed by the long,  brown stalk of a wife.    So the train sits comfortably for five or ten minutes, in the way the  trains have. At last we hear whistles and horns, and our old fat friend  running and clinging like a fat crab to the very end of the train as it  sets off. At the same instant a loud shriek and a bunch of shouts from  outside. We all jump up. There, down the line, is the long brown stork  of a wife. She had just walked back to a house some hundred yards off,  for a few words, and has now seen the train moving.    Now behold her with her hands thrown to heaven, and hear the wild shriek  \"Madonna!\" through all the hubbub. But she picks up her two skirt-knees,  and with her thin legs in grey stockings starts with a mad rush after  the train. In vain. The train inexorably pursues its course. Prancing,  she reaches one end of the platform as we leave the other end. Then she  realizes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3721"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part I: Pioneers of France in the New World (#16)"],[1," the  temporal arm might not fail, the men were daily practised on deck in  shooting at marks, in order, says the chronicle, that the recruits might  learn not to be afraid of their guns.    The dead calm continued. \"We were all very tired,\" says the chaplain,  \"and I above all, with praying to God for a fair wind. To-day, at about  two in the afternoon, He took pity on us, and sent us a breeze.\" Before  night they saw land,--the faint line of forest, traced along the watery  horizon, that marked the coast of Florida. But where, in all this vast  monotony, was the lurking-place of the French? Menendez anchored, and  sent a captain with twenty men ashore, who presently found a band  of Indians, and gained from them the needed information. He stood  northward, till, on the afternoon of Tuesday, the fourth of September,  he descried four ships anchored near the mouth of a river. It was the  river St. John's, and the ships were four of Ribaut's squadron. The prey  was in sight. The Spaniards prepared for battle, and bore down upon the  Lutherans; for, with them, all Protestants alike were branded with the  name of the arch-heretic. Slowly, before the faint breeze, the ships  glided on their way; but while, excited and impatient, the fierce crews  watched the decreasing space, and when they were still three leagues  from their prize, the air ceased to stir, the sails flapped against the  mast, a black cloud with thunder rose above the coast, and the warm rain  of the South descended on the breathless sea. It was dark before the  wind stirred again and the ships resumed their course. At half-past  eleven they reached the French. The \"San Pelayo\" slowly moved to  windward of Ribaut's flag-ship, the \"Trinity,\" and anchored very near  her. The other ships took similar stations. While these preparations  were making, a work of two hours, the men labored in silence, and the  French, thronging their gangways, looked on in equal silence. \"Never,  since I came into the world,\" writes the chaplain, \"did I know such a  stillness.\"    It was broken at length by a trumpet from the deck of the \"San Pelayo.\"  A French trumpet answered. Then Menendez, \"with much courtesy,\" says his  Spanish eulogist, inquired, \"Gentlemen, whence does this fleet come?\"    \"From France,\" was the reply.    \"What are you doing here?\" pursued the Adelantado.    \"Bringing soldiers and supplies for a fort which the King of France has  in this country, and for many others which he soon will have.\"    \"Are you Catholics or Lutherans?\"    Many voices cried out together, \"Lutherans, of the new religion.\" Then,  in their turn, they demanded who Menendez was, and whence he came.    He answered: \"I am Pedro Menendez, General of the fleet of the King of  Spain, Don Philip the Second, who have come to this country to hang  and behead all Lutherans whom I shall find by land or sea, according to  instructions from my King, so precise that I have power to pardon none;  and these commands I shall fulfil, as you will see. At daybreak I shall  board your ships, and if I find there any Catholic, he shall be well  treated; but every heretic shall die.\"    The French with one voice raised a cry of wrath and defiance.    \"If you are a brave man, don't wait till day. Come on now, and see what  you will get!\"    And they assailed the Adelantado with a shower of scoffs and insults.    Menendez broke into a rage, and gave the order to board. The men slipped  the cables, and the sullen black hulk of the \"San Pelayo\" drifted down  upon the \"Trinity.\" The French did not make good their defiance. Indeed,  they were incapable of resistance, Ribaut with his soldiers being ashore  at Fort Caroline. They cut their cables, left their anchors, made sail,  and fled. The Spaniards fired, the French replied. The other Spanish  ships had imitated the movement of the \"San Pelayo;\" \"but,\" writes the  chaplain, Mendoza, \"these devils are such adroit sailors, and maneuvred  so well, that we did not catch one of them.\" Pursuers and pursued ran  out to sea, firing useless volleys at each other.    In the morning Menendez gave over the chase, turned, and, with the  \"San Pelayo\" alone, ran back for the St. John's. But here a welcome was  prepared for him. He saw bands of armed men drawn up on the beach, and  the smaller vessels of Ribaut's squadron, which had crossed the bar  several days before, anchored behind it to oppose his landing. He would  not venture an attack, but, steering southward, sailed along the coast  till he came to an inlet which he named San Augustine, the same which  Laudonniere had named the River of Dolphins.    Here he found three of his ships already debarking their troops, guns,  and stores. Two officers, Patiflo and Vicente, had taken possession  of the dwelling of the Indian chief Seloy, a huge barn-like structure,  strongly framed of entire trunks of trees, and thatched with palmetto  leaves. Around it they were throwing up entrenchments of fascines and  sand, and gangs of negroes were toiling at the work. Such was the birth  of St. Augustine, the oldest town of the United States.    On the eighth, Menendez took formal possession of his domain. Cannon  were fired, trumpets sounded, and banners displayed, as he landed in  state at the head of his officers and nobles. Mendoza, crucifix in hand,  came to meet him, chanting Te Deum laudamus, while the Adelantado  and all his company, kneeling, kissed the crucifix, and the assembled  Indians gazed in silent wonder.    Meanwhile the tenants of Fort Caroline were not idle. Two or three  soldiers, strolling along the beach in the afternoon, had first seen the  Spanish ships, and hastily summoned Ribaut. He came down to the mouth  of the river, followed by an anxious and excited crowd; but, as they  strained their eyes through the darkness, they could see nothing but the  flashes of the distant guns. At length the returning light showed,  far out at sea, the Adelantado in hot chase of their flying comrades.  Pursuers and pursued were soon out of sight. The drums beat to arms.  After many hours of suspense, the \"San Pelayo\" reappeared, hovering  about the mouth of the river, then bearing away towards the south. More  anxious hours ensued, when three other sail came in sight, and they  recognized three of their own returning ships. Communication was opened,  a boat's crew landed, and they learned from Cosette, one of the French  captains, that, confiding in the speed of his ship, he had followed the  Spaniards to St. Augustine, reconnoitred their position, and seen them  land their negroes and intrench themselves.    Laudonniere lay sick in bed in his chamber at Fort Caroline when Ribaut  entered, and with him La Grange, Sainte Marie, Ottigny, Yonville, and  other officers. At the bedside of the displaced commandant, they held  their council of war. Three plans were proposed: first, to remain  where they were and fortify themselves; next, to push overland for St.  Augustine and attack the invaders in their intrenchments; and, finally,  to embark and assail them by sea. The first plan would leave their  ships a prey to the Spaniards; and so, too, in all likelihood, would  the second, besides the uncertainties of an overland march through  an unknown wilderness. By sea, the distance was short and the route  explored. By a sudden blow they could capture or destroy the Spanish  ships, and master the troops on shore before reinforcements could  arrive, and before they had time to complete their defences.    Such were the views of Ribaut, with which, not unnaturally, Laudonniere  finds fault, and Le Moyne echoes the censures of his chief. And yet  the plan seems as well conceived as it was bold, lacking nothing but  success. The Spaniards, stricken with terror, owed their safety to the  elements, or, as they say, to the special interposition of the Holy  Virgin. Menendez was a leader fit to stand with Cortes and Pizarro;  but he was matched with a man as cool, skilful, prompt, and daring as  himself. The traces that have come down to us indicate in Ribaut one far  above the common stamp,--\"a distinguished man, of many high qualities,\"  as even the fault-finding Le Moyne calls him; devout after the  best spirit of the Reform; and with a human heart under his steel  breastplate.    La Grange and other officers took part with Landonniere, and opposed the  plan of an attack by sea; but Ribaut's conviction was unshaken, and the  order was given. All his own soldiers fit for duty embarked in haste,  and with them went La Caille, Arlac, and, as it seems, Ottigny, with the  best of Laudonniere's men. Even Le Moyne, though wounded in the fight  with Outina's warriors, went on board to bear his part in the fray, and  would have sailed with the rest had not Ottigny, seeing his disabled  condition, ordered him back to the fort.    On the tenth, the ships, crowded with troops, set sail. Ribaut was gone,  and with him the bone and sinew of the colony. The miserable remnant  watched his receding sails with dreary foreboding,--a fore-boding which  seemed but too just, when, on the next day, a storm, more violent than  the Indians had ever known, howled through the forest and lashed the  ocean into fury. Most forlorn was the plight of these exiles, left, it  might be, the prey of a band of ferocious bigots more terrible than the  fiercest hordes of the wilderness; and when night closed on the stormy  river and the gloomy waste of pines, what dreams of terror may not  have haunted the helpless women who crouched under the hovels of Fort  Caroline!    The fort was in a ruinous state, with the palisade on the water side  broken down, and three breaches in the rampart. In the driving rain,  urged by the sick Laudonniere, the men, bedrenched and disheartened,  labored as they could to strengthen their defences. Their muster-roll  shows but a beggarly array. \"Now,\" says Laudonniere, \"let them which  have bene bold to say that I had men ynough left me, so"]]]
