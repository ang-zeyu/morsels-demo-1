He had a retentive memory, and never forgot anything he  heard or read. The few books left to him by his oft-referred-to Aunt  Jane had stocked his mind with a miscellaneous information which  sometimes made Felix and me doubt if we knew as much as Peter after all.  Felicity was so impressed by his knowledge of astronomy that she dropped  back from the other girls and walked beside him. She had not done so  before because he was barefooted. It was permissible for hired boys to  go to public meetings--when not held in the church--with bare feet, and  no particular disgrace attached to it. But Felicity would not walk with  a barefooted companion. It was dark now, so nobody would notice his  feet.    \"I know a story about the Milky Way,\" said the Story Girl, brightening  up. \"I read it in a book of Aunt Louisa's in town, and I learned it  off by heart. Once there were two archangels in heaven, named Zerah and  Zulamith--\"    \"Have angels names--same as people?\" interrupted Peter.    \"Yes, of course. They MUST have. They'd be all mixed up if they hadn't.\"    \"And when I'm an angel--if I ever get to be one--will my name still be  Peter?\"    \"No. You'll have a new name up there,\" said Cecily gently. \"It says so  in the Bible.\"    \"Well, I'm glad of that. Peter would be such a funny name for an angel.  And what is the difference between angels and archangels?\"    \"Oh, archangels are angels that have been angels so long that they've  had time to grow better and brighter and more beautiful than newer  angels,\" said the Story Girl, who probably made that explanation up on  the spur of the moment, just to pacify Peter.    \"How long does it take for an angel to grow into an archangel?\" pursued  Peter.    \"Oh, I don't know. Millions of years likely. And even then I don't  suppose ALL the angels do. A good many of them must just stay plain  angels, I expect.\"    \"I shall be satisfied just to be a plain angel,\" said Felicity modestly.    \"Oh, see here, if you're going to interrupt and argue over everything,  we'll never get the story told,\" said Felix. \"Dry up, all of you, and  let the Story Girl go on.\"    We dried up, and the Story Girl went on.    \"Zerah and Zulamith loved each other, just as mortals love, and this is  forbidden by the laws of the Almighty. And because Zerah and Zulamith  had so broken God's law they were banished from His presence to the  uttermost bounds of the universe. If they had been banished TOGETHER it  would have been no punishment; so Zerah was exiled to a star on one side  of the universe, and Zulamith was sent to a star on the other side of  the universe; and between them was a fathomless abyss which thought  itself could not cross. Only one thing could cross it--and that was  love. Zulamith yearned for Zerah with such fidelity and longing that  he began to build up a bridge of light from his star; and Zerah, not  knowing this, but loving and longing for him, began to build a similar  bridge of light from her star. For a thousand thousand years they both  built the bridge of light, and at last they met and sprang into each  other's arms. Their toil and loneliness and suffering were all over and  forgotten, and the bridge they had built spanned the gulf between their  stars of exile.    \"Now, when the other archangels saw what had been done they flew in fear  and anger to God's white throne, and cried to Him,    \"'See what these rebellious ones have done! They have built them a  bridge of light across the universe, and set Thy decree of separation at  naught. Do Thou, then, stretch forth Thine arm and destroy their impious  work.'    \"They ceased--and all heaven was hushed. Through the silence sounded the  voice of the Almighty.    \"'Nay,' He said, 'whatsoever in my universe true love hath builded not  even the Almighty can destroy. The bridge must stand forever.'    \"And,\" concluded the Story Girl, her face upturned to the sky and her  big eyes filled with starlight, \"it stands still. That bridge is the  Milky Way.\"    \"What a lovely story,\" sighed Sara Ray, who had been wooed to a  temporary forgetfulness of her woes by its charm.    The rest of us came back to earth, feeling that we had been wandering  among the hosts of heaven. We were not old enough to appreciate fully  the wonderful meaning of the legend; but we felt its beauty and  its appeal. To us forevermore the Milky Way would be, not Peter's  overwhelming garland of suns, but the lucent bridge, love-created, on  which the banished archangels crossed from star to star.    We had to go up Sara Ray's lane with her to her very door, for she was  afraid Peg Bowen would catch her if she went alone. Then the Story Girl  and I walked up the hill together. Peter and Felicity lagged behind.  Cecily and Dan and Felix were walking before us, hand in hand, singing a  hymn. Cecily had a very sweet voice, and I listened in delight. But the  Story Girl sighed.    \"What if Sara does take the measles?\" she asked miserably.    \"Everyone has to have the measles sometime,\" I said comfortingly, \"and  the younger you are the better.\"        CHAPTER XI. THE STORY GIRL DOES PENANCE    Ten days later, Aunt Olivia and Uncle Roger went to town one evening,  to remain over night, and the next day. Peter and the Story Girl were to  stay at Uncle Alec's during their absence.    We were in the orchard at sunset, listening to the story of King  Cophetua and the beggar maid--all of us, except Peter, who was hoeing  turnips, and Felicity, who had gone down the hill on an errand to Mrs.  Ray.    The Story Girl impersonated the beggar maid so vividly, and with such  an illusion of beauty, that we did not wonder in the least at the king's  love for her. I had read the story before, and it had been my opinion  that it was \"rot.\" No king, I felt certain, would ever marry a beggar  maid when he had princesses galore from whom to choose. But now I  understood it all.    When Felicity returned we concluded from her expression that she had  news. And she had.    \"Sara is real sick,\" she said, with regret, and something that was not  regret mingled in her voice. \"She has a cold and sore throat, and she is  feverish. Mrs. Ray says if she isn't better by the morning she's going  to send for the doctor. AND SHE IS AFRAID IT'S THE MEASLES.\"    Felicity flung the last sentence at the Story Girl, who turned very  pale.    \"Oh, do you suppose she caught them at the magic lantern show?\" she said  miserably.    \"Where else could she have caught them?\" said Felicity mercilessly. \"I  didn't see her, of course--Mrs. Ray met me at the door and told me not  to come in. But Mrs. Ray says the measles always go awful hard with the  Rays--if they don't die completely of them it leaves them deaf or half  blind, or something like that. Of course,\" added Felicity, her heart  melting at sight of the misery in the Story Girl's piteous eyes, \"Mrs.  Ray always looks on the dark side, and it may not be the measles Sara  has after all.\"    But Felicity had done her work too thoroughly. The Story Girl was not to  be comforted.    \"I'd give anything if I'd never put Sara up to going to that show,\" she  said. \"It's all my fault--but the punishment falls on Sara, and that  isn't fair. I'd go this minute and confess the whole thing to Mrs. Ray;  but if I did it might get Sara into more trouble, and I mustn't do that.  I sha'n't sleep a wink to-night.\"    I don't think she did. She looked very pale and woebegone when she came  down to breakfast. But, for all that, there was a certain exhilaration  about her.    \"I'm going to do penance all day for coaxing Sara to disobey her  mother,\" she announced with chastened triumph.    \"Penance?\" we murmured in bewilderment.    \"Yes. I'm going to deny myself everything I like, and do everything  I can think of that I don't like, just to punish myself for being so  wicked. And if any of you think of anything I don't, just mention it to  me. I thought it out last night. Maybe Sara won't be so very sick if God  sees I'm truly sorry.\"    \"He can see it anyhow, without your doing anything,\" said Cecily.    \"Well, my conscience will feel better.\"    \"I don't believe Presbyterians ever do penance,\" said Felicity  dubiously. \"I never heard of one doing it.\"    But the rest of us rather looked with favour on the Story Girl's idea.  We felt sure that she would do penance as picturesquely and thoroughly  as she did everything else.    \"You might put peas in your shoes, you know,\" suggested Peter.    \"The very thing! I never thought of that. I'll get some after breakfast.  I'm not going to eat a single thing all day, except bread and water--and  not much of that!\"    This, we felt, was a heroic measure indeed. To sit down to one of Aunt  Janet's meals, in ordinary health and appetite, and eat nothing but  bread and water--that would be penance with a vengeance! We felt WE  could never do it. But the Story Girl did it. We admired and pitied her.  But now I do not think that she either needed our pity or deserved our  admiration. Her ascetic fare was really sweeter to her than honey  of Hymettus. She was, though quite unconsciously, acting a part,  and tasting all the subtle joy of the artist, which is so much more  exquisite than any material pleasure.    Aunt Janet, of course, noticed the Story Girl's abstinence and asked if  she was sick.    \"No. I am just doing penance, Aunt Janet, for a sin I committed. I can't  confess it, because that would bring trouble on another person. So I'm  going to do penance all day. You don't mind, do you?\"    Aunt Janet was in a very good humour that morning, so she merely  laughed.    \"Not if you don't go too far with your nonsense,\" she said tolerantly.    \"Thank you. And will you give me a handful of hard peas after breakfast,  Aunt Janet? I want to put them in my shoes.\"    \"There"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53506"],[0,"A Collection of Kachári Folk-Tales and Rhymes (#16)"],[1," will be \"Âdâ Bùidâsi,\" and she will  select men's work, as, e.g., \"Hâthi hunù hâiâbâ, ângbù thâng-fâ-gan.\"      A Mother-in-law scolds her Daughter-in-law.
