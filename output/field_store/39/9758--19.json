Skilful as a hunter, a keen observer, familiar with  military life from four years of service as a lieutenant of infantry,  and developed from his ill health, which caused him to leave the army in  1796, into a magnificent specimen of manhood, he proved so efficient a  coadjutor that his name will ever be inseparably associated with that of  Lewis.    Lewis left Washington July 5, 1803, his mission being enhanced in its  importance by the formal cession of Louisiana to the United States by  the treaty of Paris, April 30, 1803, which news reached him July 1st.  The rendezvous was at St. Louis, which was reached via Pittsburgh and  the Ohio, recruits being selected at various posts, while Lieutenant  Clark joined at Louisville, though he was not commissioned in the army  till the following March.    When the party reached St. Louis, in December, 1803, formal notice of  the transfer of Louisiana had not reached the Spanish commandant, who  would not permit their passage westward. They passed the winter in camp  opposite the mouth of the Missouri, where they built a barge with  sail-power and two smaller boats, with which they started up the  Missouri River on May 14, 1804.    The expedition, commanded by Captain Lewis, with Lieutenant Clark as  second, comprised thirty-four selected men, eleven being watermen, a  negro servant, and a hunter, who was also an interpreter.    The valley of the lower Missouri was well known to the French Canadians,  who, pushed westward by the irruption of English settlers in the  Illinois region, sought isolation and freedom from foreign restraint in  the country west of the Mississippi. St. Louis was their headquarters,  but the Missouri was their field of fortune. The village of St. Charles,  with its single street, had about five hundred souls, who lived by  hunting and trade with the Indians, agriculture being quite neglected;  and an outpost of seven poverty-stricken families existed at La  Charrette, the advance guard of civilization. But the typical French  trader and trapper disdained the shelter of a roof and the restraint of  communities. His adventurous spirit pushed his frail bark into the quiet  waters of the upper Kansas, through the shallows of the Platte, under  the overshading trees of the beautiful James, along the precipitous  red-clay cliffs of the Big Sioux, and, in search of the beaver, even  penetrated the winding narrows of the Cheyenne and Little Missouri. They  did not even stop at transient visits, but, fascinated by the roving,  aimless life of the savage, took up abode with him, shared his tepee and  wanderings, adopted his customs, took his squaw to wife, until longings  strange and uncontrollable drew them back in old age to the home and  religion of their youth. One of these venturesome wanderers named  Durion, who had lived twenty years among the Sioux, was picked up on the  river and accompanied Lewis to the mouth of the James, as a much-needed  interpreter.    The mouth of the Platte was passed on July 21st, and on the next day  Lewis camped on the site of the present city of Council Bluffs, thus  named by Lewis on account of his council with the Ottoes and Missouri  Indians at this point. Here the first of a continuing series of presents  was given to the grand chief: an American flag, a large medal, which was  placed around his neck as a mark of consideration, paint, garters, cloth  ornaments, a canister of powder, and the indispensable bottle of  whiskey. The subordinate chiefs received inferior medals and presents  according to their importance. These presents were made with much form  and ceremony, wherein an important part were speeches setting forth the  transfer of the territory to the United States, the benefits of peace,  and the advantages of trade at the new post to be occupied by Americans.    Both Lewis and Clark had been accustomed to Indian life on the Eastern  frontiers, but they found much that was strange and striking among the  denizens of the great interior plains. Beyond the breech-cloth a loose  buffalo robe usually kept the savage from nudity. The necklace of  grizzly bear-claws, the ornaments of porcupine and feathers, the  scalp-poles, the conical teepes covered with gayly-figured skins, the  blue smoke up-curling from the open tent-top, the hoop-tambourine or  half-drum, the queer whip-rattle of the hoofs of goats and deer, the  bladder-rattle full of pebbles, the shaven heads of the men, the  white-dressed buffalo robe with its jingling rows of porcupine quills  and uncouth painted figures, emblematic of the brave's war-history, the  hawk-feather or eagle-plume head-dress worked with porcupine quills,  the polecat skin trailing from the young brave's moccasins, the  deer-paunch tobacco-pouch, and a score of other novelties met their  observing eyes. Among the Rickarees the octagonal earth-covered lodges,  the picketed villages, the cultivated patches of corn, beans, and  potatoes, the basket-like boats of interwoven boughs covered with a  single buffalo skin, in which squaws paddled unconcernedly over high  waves, were unknown phases of savage life.    Even the earth gave up its treasure, and they found the first of the  famous petrifactions of the trans-Missouri region in the back-bone of a  fish forty-five feet long, in a perfect state.    [Illustration: A Blackfoot Tepee.]    Game gradually grew plentiful as they ascended the river. Buffalo was  not seen till the Big Sioux was reached, but later fifteen herds and  three bands of elk were visible at one time, and near Mandan large  flocks of goats were seen crossing from their summer grazing grounds to  find west of the Missouri winter shelter in the hilly regions. As they  passed the Indians drove large flocks of migrating goats into the river,  where even boys killed the helpless animals by scores with sticks.  Indeed, the Missouri then appears to have been a hunter's paradise, for  there are mentioned among the regular game antelope, bear, beaver,  buffalo, badger, deer, elk, goats, and porcupine. Three thousand  antelope were seen at one time, and of this animal Lewis accurately  remarks: \"The antelope possesses most wonderful swiftness, the acuteness  of their sight distinguishes the most distant danger, the delicate  sensibility of their smell defeats the precautions of concealment, and  when alarmed their rapid career seems more like the flight of birds than  the movements of an earthly being.\"    The river furnished abundant supply of cat and buffalo fish, and  feathered game, such as plover, grouse, geese, turkeys, ducks, and  pelican, also abounded; among the vegetable products are enumerated  several kinds of grapes, currants and plums, wild apples, billberries,  cherries, gooseberries, mulberries, raspberries, acorns, and hazel-nuts.    As regards the voyage thus far, it was true that the sail could rarely  be used, that the labor of propelling the boats by oar or pole was most  laborious, and that the shallows gave great trouble; but the Indians,  save a single threatening occasion, were most friendly, and the only  death, that of Sergeant Floyd, was from acute disease. Indeed, the  journey had been most attractive and free from special hazard, and when  rapidly advancing winter obliged them to go into permanent quarters, on  October 27th, it seemed rather a long hunting excursion than a dangerous  voyage of discovery.    Their winter quarters, called Fort Mandan, were on the eastern side of  the Missouri, sixteen hundred miles from St. Louis, and in latitude 47 deg.  22' N., a short distance above the present city of Bismarck. The  buildings were wooden huts, which joined and formed two sides of a  triangle, while the third side was of pickets. As the huts opened  inward, they had a stockaded place easy of defence.    On his arrival at Fort Mandan, Lewis found a Mr. McCracken, of the  Hudson Bay Company, engaged in trading for horses and buffalo robes.  During the winter ten or twelve different traders of this company  visited Mandan, and although one bore a letter from the chief factor,  Mr. Charles Chabouilles, offering any service in his power, yet it was  evident to Lewis that these traders were cultivating sentiments  unfriendly to Americans among the Indians, and Chaboneau, the  interpreter was tampered with; but the prompt and judicious action of  Lewis resulted in apologies and promises to refrain from such conduct in  future. Laroche, one of the Hudson Bay traders, desired to go west with  the expedition, but it was thought best to decline the offer. At this  time the nearest English trading-post was at the forks of the  Assiniboin, about one hundred and fifty miles distant by the way of  Mouse River.    The stay at Fort Mandan was marked by two sad experiences for the  Indians encamped near the post: an autumnal prairie fire which burned  two Indians to death, and an attack of the Sioux, wherein one Mandan was  killed and two wounded. A Frenchman, Jesseaume, living with the Indians,  served as interpreter, and they learned much of the Mandans, Rickarees,  and Minnetarees. The Rickarees appeared in a very sensible light by  refusing spirits, with the remark that they did not use it, and were  surprised that their father should present to them a liquor which would  make them fools. The sensibilities of these Indians in their peculiar  way appeared in a chief who cried bitterly at seeing a court-martial  sentence of flogging carried out on a soldier. The chief acknowledged  the necessity of exemplary punishment, and said that for the same  offence he had killed his braves, but that he never whipped any one, not  even children.    The Mandans, through intervention, made peace with the Rickarees, and  restored traps and furs which they had taken from French hunters. During  the entire winter these Indian tribes were most friendly, and their  stores of corn, obtained by the expeditionary force by trade or  "]]]
