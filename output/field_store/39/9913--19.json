This  defalcation was not to be overlooked, nor should Khamisi be permitted to  return without an effort to apprehend him. Accordingly Uledi and Ferajji  were despatched in pursuit while we rested at Imbiki, in order to give  the dilapidated soldiers and animals time to recruit.    On the 8th we continued our journey, and arrived at Msuwa. This march  will be remembered by our caravan as the most fatiguing of all, though  the distance was but ten miles. It was one continuous jungle, except  three interjacent glades of narrow limits, which gave us three breathing  pauses in the dire task of jungle travelling. The odour emitted from  its fell plants was so rank, so pungently acrid, and the miasma from its  decayed vegetation so dense, that I expected every moment to see myself  and men drop down in paroxysms of acute fever. Happily this evil was  not added to that of loading and unloading the frequently falling packs.  Seven soldiers to attend seventeen laden donkeys were entirely too small  a number while passing through a jungle; for while the path is but a  foot wide, with a wall of thorny plants and creepers bristling on each  side, and projecting branches darting across it, with knots of spikey  twigs stiff as spike-nails, ready to catch and hold anything above four  feet in height, it is but reasonable to suppose that donkeys standing  four feet high, with loads measuring across from bale to bale four feet,  would come to grief. This grief was of frequent recurrence here, causing  us to pause every few minutes for re-arrangements. So often had this  task to be performed, that the men got perfectly discouraged, and had to  bespoken to sharply before they set to work. By the time I reached Msuwa  there was nobody with me and the ten donkeys I drove but Mabruk the  Little, who, though generally stolid, stood to his work like a man.  Bombay and Uledi were far behind, with the most jaded donkeys. Shaw  was in charge of the cart, and his experiences were most bitter, as he  informed me he had expended a whole vocabulary of stormy abuse known  to sailors, and a new one which he had invented ex tempore. He did not  arrive until two o'clock next morning, and was completely worn out.    Another halt was fixed at Msuwa, that we and our animals might  recuperate. The chief of the village, a white man in everything but  colour, sent me and mine the fattest broad-tailed sheep of his  flock, with five measures of matama grain. The mutton was excellent,  unapproachable. For his timely and needful present I gave him two doti,  and amused him with an exhibition of the wonderful mechanism of the  Winchester rifle, and my breechloading revolvers.    He and his people were intelligent enough to comprehend the utility of  these weapons at an emergency, and illustrated in expressive pantomime  the powers they possessed against numbers of people armed only with  spears and bows, by extending their arms with an imaginary gun and  describing a clear circle. \"Verily,\" said they, \"the Wasungu are far  wiser than the Washensi. What heads they have! What wonderful things  they make! Look at their tents, their guns, their time-pieces, their  clothes, and that little rolling thing (the cart) which carries more  than five men,---que!\"    On the 10th, recovered from the excessive strain of the last march, the  caravan marched out of Msuwa, accompanied by the hospitable villagers  as far as their stake defence, receiving their unanimous \"Kwaheris.\"  Outside the village the march promised to be less arduous than between  Imbiki and Msuwa. After crossing a beautiful little plain intersected  by a dry gully or mtoni, the route led by a few cultivated fields, where  the tillers greeted us with one grand unwinking stare, as if fascinated.    Soon after we met one of those sights common in part of the world, to  wit a chain slave-gang, bound east. The slaves did not appear to be  in any way down-hearted on the contrary, they seemed imbued with the  philosophic jollity of the jolly servant of Martin Chuzzlewit. Were it  not for their chains, it would have been difficult to discover master  from slave; the physiognomic traits were alike--the mild benignity with  which we were regarded was equally visible on all faces. The chains were  ponderous--they might have held elephants captive; but as the slaves  carried nothing but themselves, their weight could not have been  insupportable.    The jungle was scant on this march, and though in some places the packs  met with accidents, they were not such as seriously to retard progress.  By 10 A.M. we were in camp in the midst of an imposing view of green  sward and forest domed by a cloudless sky. We had again pitched our camp  in the wilderness, and, as is the custom of caravans, fired two shots to  warn any Washensi having grain to sell, that we were willing to trade.    Our next halting-place was Kisemo, distant but eleven miles from Msuwa,  a village situated in a populous district, having in its vicinity no  less than five other villages, each fortified by stakes and thorny  abattis, with as much fierce independence as if their petty lords were  so many Percys and Douglasses. Each topped a ridge, or a low hummock,  with an assumption of defiance of the cock-on-its-own-dunghill type.  Between these humble eminences and low ridges of land wind narrow vales  which are favored with the cultivation of matama and Indian corn. Behind  the village flows the Ungerengeri River, an impetuous stream during the  Masika season, capable of overflowing its steep banks, but in the dry  season it subsides into its proper status, which is that of a small  stream of very clear sweet water. Its course from Kisemo is south-west,  then easterly; it is the main feeder of the Kingani River.    The belles of Kisemo are noted for their vanity in brass wire, which is  wound in spiral rings round their wrists and ankles, and the varieties  of style which their hispid heads exhibit; while their poor lords,  obliged to be contented with dingy torn clouts and split ears, show what  wide sway Asmodeus holds over this terrestrial sphere--for it must have  been an unhappy time when the hard-besieged husbands finally gave  way before their spouses. Besides these brassy ornaments on their  extremities, and the various hair-dressing styles, the women of Kisemo  frequently wear lengthy necklaces, which run in rivers of colours down  their bodies.    A more comical picture is seldom presented than that of one of these  highly-dressed females engaged in the homely and necessary task of  grinding corn for herself and family. The grinding apparatus consists  of two portions: one, a thick pole of hard wood about six feet long,  answering for a pestle; the other, a capacious wooden mortar, three feet  in height.    While engaged in setting his tent, Shaw was obliged to move a small flat  stone, to drive a peg into the ground. The village chief, who saw him do  it, rushed up in a breathless fashion, and replaced the stone instantly,  then stood on it in an impressive manner, indicative of the great  importance attached to that stone and location. Bombay, seeing Shaw  standing in silent wonder at the act, volunteered to ask the chief what  was the matter. The Sheikh solemnly answered, with a finger pointing  downward, \"Uganga!\" Whereupon I implored him to let me see what was  under the stone. With a graciousness quite affecting he complied. My  curiosity was gratified with the sight of a small whittled stick, which  pinned fast to the ground an insect, the cause of a miscarriage to a  young female of the village.    During the afternoon, Uledi and Ferajji, who had been despatched after  the truant Khamisi, returned with him and all the missing articles.  Khamisi, soon after leaving the road and plunging into the jungle,  where he was mentally triumphing in his booty, was met by some of the  plundering Washensi, who are always on the qui vive for stragglers, and  unceremoniously taken to their village in the woods, and bound to a tree  preparatory, to being killed. Khamisi said that he asked them why they  tied him up, to which they answered, that they were about to kill him,  because he was a Mgwana, whom they were accustomed to kill as soon as  they were caught. But Uledi and Ferajji shortly after coming upon the  scene, both well armed, put an end to the debates upon Khamisi's fate,  by claiming him as an absconding pagazi from the Musungu's camp, as well  as all the articles he possessed at the time of capture. The robbers did  not dispute the claim for the pagazi, goats, tent, or any other  valuable found with him, but intimated that they deserved a reward for  apprehending him. The demand being considered just, a reward to the  extent of two doti and a fundo, or ten necklaces of beads, was given.    Khamisi, for his desertion and attempted robbery, could not be pardoned  without first suffering punishment. He had asked at Bagamoyo, before  enlisting in my service, an advance of $5 in money, and had received it,  and a load of Bubu beads, no heavier than a pagazis load, had been given  him to carry; he had, therefore, no excuse for desertion. Lest I should  overstep prudence, however, in punishing him, I convened a court of  eight pagazis and four soldiers to sit in judgment, and asked them  to give me their decision as to what should be done. Their unanimous  verdict was that he was guilty of a crime almost unknown among the  Wanyamwezi pagazis, and as it was likely to give bad repute to the  Wanyamwezi carriers, they therefore sentenced him to be flogged with the  \"Great Master's\" donkey"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/517"],[0,"The Emerald City of Oz (#16)"],[1,"chickens for nearly forty  years, Billina, and I know you've got to starve 'em to make 'em lay  lots of eggs, and stuff 'em if you want good broilers.\"    \"Broilers!\" exclaimed Billina, in horror.  \"Broil my chickens!\"    \"Why, that's what they're for, ain't it?\" asked Aunt Em, astonished.    \"No, Aunt, not in Oz,\" said Dorothy.  \"People do not eat chickens here.  You see, Billina was the first hen that was ever seen in this country,  and I brought her here myself.  Everybody liked her an' respected her,  so the Oz people wouldn't any more eat her chickens than they would eat  Billina.\"    \"Well, I declare,\" gasped Aunt Em.  \"How about the eggs?\"    \"Oh, if we have more eggs than we want to hatch, we allow people to eat  them,\" said Billina.  \"Indeed, I am very glad the Oz folks like our  eggs, for otherwise they would spoil.\"    \"This certainly is a queer country,\" sighed Aunt Em.    \"Excuse me,\" called the Sawhorse, \"the path has ended and I'd like to  know which way to go.\"    They looked around and sure enough there was no path to be seen.    \"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"we're going southwest, and it seems just as easy  to follow that direction without a path as with one.\"    \"Certainly,\" answered the Sawhorse.  \"It is not hard to draw the wagon  over the meadow.  I only want to know where to go.\"    \"There's a forest over there across the prairie,\" said the Wizard, \"and  it lies in the direction we are going.  Make straight for the forest,  Sawhorse, and you're bound to go right.\"    So the wooden animal trotted on again and the meadow grass was so soft  under the wheels that it made easy riding.  But Dorothy was a little  uneasy at losing the path, because now there was nothing to guide them.    No houses were to be seen at all, so they could not ask their way of  any farmer; and although the Land of Oz was always beautiful, wherever  one might go, this part of the country was strange to all the party.    \"Perhaps we're lost,\" suggested Aunt Em, after they had proceeded quite  a way in silence.    \"Never mind,\" said the Shaggy Man; \"I've been lost many a time--and so  has Dorothy--and we've always been found again.\"    \"But we may get hungry,\" remarked Omby Amby.  \"That is the worst of  getting lost in a place where there are no houses near.\"    \"We had a good dinner at the Fuddle town,\" said Uncle Henry, \"and that  will keep us from starving to death for a long time.\"    \"No one ever starved to death in Oz,\" declared Dorothy, positively;  \"but people may get pretty hungry sometimes.\"    The Wizard said nothing, and he did not seem especially anxious.  The  Sawhorse was trotting along briskly, yet the forest seemed farther away  than they had thought when they first saw it.  So it was nearly sundown  when they finally came to the trees; but now they found themselves in a  most beautiful spot, the wide-spreading trees being covered with  flowering vines and having soft mosses underneath them.  \"This will be  a good place to camp,\" said the Wizard, as the Sawhorse stopped for  further instructions.    \"Camp!\" they all echoed.    \"Certainly,\" asserted the Wizard.  \"It will be dark before very long  and we cannot travel through this forest at night.  So let us make a  camp here, and have some supper, and sleep until daylight comes again.\"    They all looked at the little man in astonishment, and Aunt Em said,  with a sniff:    \"A pretty camp we'll have, I must say!  I suppose you intend us to  sleep under the wagon.\"    \"And chew grass for our supper,\" added the Shaggy Man, laughing.    But Dorothy seemed to have no doubts and was quite cheerful    \"It's lucky we have the wonderful Wizard with us,\" she said; \"because  he can do 'most anything he wants to.\"    \"Oh, yes; I forgot we had a Wizard,\" said Uncle Henry, looking at the  little man curiously.    \"I didn't,\" chirped Billina, contentedly.    The Wizard smiled and climbed out of the wagon, and all the others  followed him.    \"In order to camp,\" said he, \"the first thing we need is tents.  Will  some one please lend me a handkerchief?\"    The Shaggy Man offered him one, and Aunt Em another.  He took them both  and laid them carefully upon the grass near to the edge of the forest.  Then he laid his own handkerchief down, too, and standing a little back  from them he waved his left hand toward the handkerchiefs and said:      \"Tents of canvas, white as snow,    Let me see how fast you grow!\"      Then, lo and behold! the handkerchiefs became tiny tents, and as the  travelers looked at them the tents grew bigger and bigger until in a  few minutes each one was large enough to contain the entire party.    \"This,\" said the Wizard, pointing to the first tent, \"is for the  accommodation of the ladies.  Dorothy, you and your Aunt may step  inside and take off your things.\"    Every one ran to look inside the tent, and they saw two pretty white  beds, all ready for Dorothy and Aunt Em, and a silver roost for  Billina.  Rugs were spread upon the grassy floor and some camp chairs  and a table completed the furniture.    \"Well, well, well!  This beats anything I ever saw or heard of!\"  exclaimed Aunt Em, and she glanced at the Wizard almost fearfully, as  if he might be dangerous because of his great powers.    \"Oh, Mr. Wizard!  How did you manage to do it?\" asked Dorothy.    \"It's a trick Glinda the Sorceress taught me, and it is much better  magic than I used to practice in Omaha, or when I first came to Oz,\" he  answered.  \"When the good Glinda found I was to live in the Emerald  City always, she promised to help me, because she said the Wizard of Oz  ought really to be a clever Wizard, and not a humbug.  So we have been  much together and I am learning so fast that I expect to be able to  accomplish some really wonderful things in time.\"    \"You've done it now!\" declared Dorothy.  \"These tents are just  wonderful!\"    \"But come and see the men's tent,\" said the Wizard.  So they went to  the second tent, which had shaggy edges because it has been made from  the Shaggy Man's handkerchief, and found that completely furnished  also.  It contained four neat beds for Uncle Henry, Omby Amby, the  Shaggy Man and the Wizard.  Also there was a soft rug for Toto to lie  upon.    \"The third tent,\" explained the Wizard, \"is our dining room and  kitchen.\"    They visited that next, and found a table and dishes in the dining  tent, with plenty of those things necessary to use in cooking.  The  Wizard carried out a big kettle and set it swinging on a crossbar  before the tent.  While he was doing this Omby Amby and the Shaggy Man  brought a supply of twigs from the forest and then they built a fire  underneath the kettle.    \"Now, Dorothy,\" said the Wizard, smiling, \"I expect you to cook our  supper.\"    \"But there is nothing in the kettle,\" she cried.    \"Are you sure?\" inquired the Wizard.    \"I didn't see anything put in, and I'm almost sure it was empty when  you brought it out,\" she replied.    \"Nevertheless,\" said the little man, winking slyly at Uncle Henry, \"you  will do well to watch our supper, my dear, and see that it doesn't boil  over.\"    Then the men took some pails and went into the forest to search for a  spring of water, and while they were gone Aunt Em said to Dorothy:    \"I believe the Wizard is fooling us.  I saw the kettle myself, and when  he hung it over the fire there wasn't a thing in it but air.\"    \"Don't worry,\" remarked Billina, confidently, as she nestled in the  grass before the fire.  \"You'll find something in the kettle when it's  taken off--and it won't be poor, innocent chickens, either.\"    \"Your hen has very bad manners, Dorothy,\" said Aunt Em, looking  somewhat disdainfully at Billina.  \"It seems too bad she ever learned  how to talk.\"    There might have been another unpleasant quarrel between Aunt Em and  Billina had not the men returned just then with their pails filled with  clear, sparkling water.  The Wizard told Dorothy that she was a good  cook and he believed their supper was ready.    So Uncle Henry lifted the kettle from the fire and poured its contents  into a big platter which the Wizard held for him.  The platter was  fairly heaped with a fine stew, smoking hot, with many kinds of  vegetables and dumplings and a rich, delicious gravy.    The Wizard triumphantly placed the platter upon the table in the dining  tent and then they all sat down in camp chairs to the feast.    There were several other dishes on the table, all carefully covered,  and when the time came to remove these covers they found bread and  butter, cakes, cheese, pickles and fruits--including some of the  luscious strawberries of Oz.    No one ventured to ask a question as to how these things came there.  They contented themselves by eating heartily the good things provided,  and Toto and Billina had their full share, you may be sure.  After the  meal was over, Aunt Em whispered to Dorothy:    \"That may have been magic food, my dear, and for that reason perhaps it  won't be very nourishing; but I'm willing to say it tasted as good as  anything I ever et.\"  Then she added, in a louder voice: \"Who's going  to do the dishes?\"    \"No one, madam,\" answered the Wizard.  \"The dishes have 'done'  themselves.\"    \"La sakes!\" ejaculated the good lady, holding up her hands in  amazement.  For, sure enough, when she looked at the dishes they had a  moment before left upon the table, she found them all washed and dried  and piled up into neat stacks.        15.  How Dorothy Happened to Get Lost    It was a beautiful evening, so they drew their camp chairs in a circle  before one of the tents and began to tell stories to amuse themselves  and pass away the time before they went to bed.    Pretty soon a zebra was seen coming out of the forest, and he trotted  straight up to them and said politely:    \"Good evening, people.\"    The zebra was a sleek little animal and had a slender head, a stubby  mane and a paint-brush tail--very like a donkey's.
