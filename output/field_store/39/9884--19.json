The minutes were read three times, and unanimously adopted  and received for a form and constitution of the High Council of the  Church of Christ hereafter; with this provision, that if the President  should hereafter discover anything lacking in the same, he should be  privileged to supply it.    The number present who received the above-named document, was  twenty-six High Priests, eighteen Elders, three Priests, one Teacher,  and fourteen private members, making in all sixty-two.    {32} After giving such instruction as the Spirit dictated, I laid my  hands upon the heads of the two assistant Presidents severally and  blessed them, that they might have wisdom to magnify their office and  power to prevail over the adversary.    I also laid my hands upon the twelve Councilors, and commanded a  blessing to rest upon them, that they might have wisdom and power to  counsel in righteousness, upon all subjects that might be laid before  them. I also prayed that they might be delivered from those evils to  which they were most exposed, and that their lives might be prolonged  on the earth.    My father, Joseph, then laid his hands upon my head, and said,        Joseph, I lay my hands upon thy head, and pronounce the blessings      of thy progenitors upon thee, that thou mayest hold the keys of the      mysteries of the kingdom of heaven until the coming of the Lord.      Amen.    He also laid his hands upon the head of his son Samuel, and said,        Samuel, I lay my hands upon thy head, and pronounce the blessings      of thy progenitors upon thee, that thou mayest remain a Priest of      the Most High God, and like Samuel of old, hear His voice, saying,      Samuel, Samuel. Amen.    Father John Johnson, also, laid his hands upon the head of his son  Luke, and said,        My Father in heaven, I ask Thee to bless this my son, according to      the blessings of his forefathers; that he may be strengthened in      his ministry, according to his holy calling. Amen.    I then gave the assistant Presidents a solemn charge to do their duty  in righteousness, and in the fear of God; I also charged the twelve  Councilors in a similar manner, all in the name of Jesus Christ.    We all raised our hands to heaven in token of the everlasting covenant,  and the Lord blessed us with His Spirit. I then declared the council  organized according to the {33} ancient order, and also according to  the mind of the Lord.    [Sidenote: First Case before the High Council.]    The following complaint was then presented before the Council by Ezra  Thayer, a High Priest:        Kirtland, February 19, 1834.        _To the President of the High Council of the Church of Christ_.        The following charges I prefer against Elder Curtis Hodges, Sen.,      of this Church: First, for an error in spirit; second, for an error      in the manner of his address, which consisted in loud speaking, and      a want of clearness in articulation, which was calculated to do      injury to the cause of God; and also, for contending that that was      a good and proper spirit that actuated him thus to speak--all of      which I consider unbecoming in an Elder in this Church, and request      a hearing before the High Council.        (Signed) Ezra Thayer.    Elder Hodges pleaded \"not guilty\" of the above charges.    Father Lions was called on to substantiate the above charges, and his  testimony was pointed against Brother Hodges. Brother Story testified  that Elder Hodges talked so loud at a prayer meeting that the neighbors  came out to see if some one was hurt. At another meeting, he said that  Elder Thayer rebuked him for his error, but he did not receive the  rebuke; that he raised his voice so high, that he could not articulate  so as to be understood; and that his teaching brought a damper upon  the meeting, and was not edifying. Brother Erastus Babbitt was then  called upon, who testified that Elder Hodges was guilty of hollowing so  loud that in a measure he lost his voice, and uttered but little else  distinctly than \"Glory to heaven's King.\" His testimony against Brother  Hodges was pointed. Brother Truman Wait testified much to the same  effect.    Councilor Oliver Cowdery stood up on the part of the accuser, and  opened the case clearly.    {34} Councilor Joseph Coe stood up on the part of the accused, but  could say but a few words.    The accuser and the accused then spoke for themselves, after which the  President arose and laid open the case still more plainly, and gave  his decision, which was, that the charges in the declaration had been  sustained by good witnesses; also, that Elder Hodges ought to have  confessed when rebuked by Elder Thayer; also, if he had the Spirit of  the Lord at the meetings, where he hollowed, he must have abused it,  and grieved it away. All the Council agreed with the decision.    Elder Hodges then rose and said he now saw his error, but never saw  it before; and appeared to feel thankful that he saw it. He said he  had learned more during this trial than he had since he came into the  Church; confessed freely his error, and said he would attend to the  overcoming of that evil, the Lord being his helper.    The Council forgave him, and adjourned to the evening of the 20th.    _February 20_.--The High Council met this evening to determine  concerning the Elders going out to preach.        _Minutes of the High Council_.        The president opened the Council by prayer.        At a church meeting, held in Pennsylvania, Erie county, and      Springfield township, by Orson Pratt and Lyman E. Johnson, High      Priests, some of the members of that church refused to partake of      the Sacrament, because the Elder administering it did not observe      the Word of Wisdom to obey it. Elder Johnson argued that they were      justified in so doing, because the Elder was in transgression.      Elder Pratt argued that the church was bound to receive the Supper      under the administration of an Elder, so long as he retained his      office or license. Voted that six Councilors should speak upon the      subject.        The Council then proceeded to try the question, whether      disobedience to the Word of Wisdom was a transgression sufficient      to deprive an official member from holding office in the Church,      after having it sufficiently taught him.        Councilors Samuel H. Smith, Luke S. Johnson, John S. Carter,      Sylvester Smith, John Johnson and Orson Hyde, were called to speak      upon {35} the case then before the Council. After the Councilors      had spoken, the President proceeded to give the decision:        No official member in this Church is worthy to hold an office,      after having the Word of Wisdom properly taught him, and he, the      official member, neglecting to comply with or obey it; which      decision the Council confirmed by vote.        The President then asked if there were any Elders present who      would go to Canada, and preach the Gospel to that people; for they      have written a number of letters for help. And the whole Council      felt as though the Spirit required the Elders to go there. It was,      therefore, decided by the Council, that Lyman E. Johnson and Milton      Holmes should travel together to Canada; that Zebedee Coltrin and      Henry Herriman travel together into Canada; and that Jared Carter      and Phineas Young travel together, if they can so arrange their      affairs at home as to be liberated.        It was also decided that Elder Oliver Granger should travel      eastward as soon as his circumstances would permit, and that he      could travel alone on account of his age; it was also decided that      Elder Martin Harris should travel alone whenever he travels; that      Elders John S. Carter and Jesse Smith travel east together as soon      as they can; and that Elder Brigham Young should travel alone, it      being his own choice; also that James Durfee and Edward Marvin      should travel together eastward; that Sidney Rigdon and John P.      Greene go to Strongville, that Orson Pratt and Harrison Sagers      travel together for the time being; and that there should be a      general conference held at Saco, in the state of Maine, on the 13th      day of June, 1834.        It was furthermore voted that Elder Orson Hyde, accompanied by      Elder Orson Pratt, go east to obtain donations for Zion, and means      to redeem the farm on which the house of the Lord stands.        The Church and Council then prayed with uplifted hands, that they      might be prospered in their mission.        Orson Hyde, Oliver Cowdery, Clerks.    Footnotes    1.

But verily I say unto you, that I have decreed a decree which my      people shall realize, inasmuch as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#16)"],[1," abstracted from its being perceived. But,  whoever shall reflect, and take care to understand what he says, will, if  I mistake not, acknowledge that all sensible qualities are alike  sensations and alike real; that where the extension is, there is the  colour, too, i.e., in his mind, and that their archetypes can exist only  in some other mind; and that the objects of sense are nothing but those  sensations combined, blended, or (if one may so speak) concreted  together; none of all which can be supposed to exist unperceived.    100. What it is for a man to be happy, or an object good, every one may  think he knows. But to frame an abstract idea of happiness, prescinded  from all particular pleasure, or of goodness from everything that is  good, this is what few can pretend to. So likewise a man may be just and  virtuous without having precise ideas of justice and virtue. The opinion  that those and the like words stand for general notions, abstracted from  all particular persons and actions, seems to have rendered morality very  difficult, and the study thereof of small use to mankind. And in effect  the doctrine of abstraction has not a little contributed towards spoiling  the most useful parts of knowledge.    101. OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND MATHEMATICS.--The two great provinces  of speculative science conversant about ideas received from sense,  are Natural Philosophy and Mathematics; with regard to each of these  I shall make some observations. And first I shall say somewhat of  Natural Philosophy. On this subject it is that the sceptics triumph.  All that stock of arguments they produce to depreciate our faculties  and make mankind appear ignorant and low, are drawn principally  from this head, namely, that we are under an invincible blindness  as to the true and real nature of things. This they exaggerate,  and love to enlarge on. We are miserably bantered, say they, by our  senses, and amused only with the outside and show of things. The real  essence, the internal qualities and constitution of every the meanest  object, is hid from our view; something there is in every drop of water,  every grain of sand, which it is beyond the power of human understanding  to fathom or comprehend. But, it is evident from what has been shown that  all this complaint is groundless, and that we are influenced by false  principles to that degree as to mistrust our senses, and think we know  nothing of those things which we perfectly comprehend.    102. One great inducement to our pronouncing ourselves ignorant of the  nature of things is the current opinion that everything includes within  itself the cause of its properties; or that there is in each object an  inward essence which is the source whence its discernible qualities flow,  and whereon they depend. Some have pretended to account for appearances  by occult qualities, but of late they are mostly resolved into mechanical  causes, to wit, the figure, motion, weight, and suchlike qualities, of  insensible particles; whereas, in truth, there is no other agent or  efficient cause than spirit, it being evident that motion, as well as all  other ideas, is perfectly inert. See sect. 25. Hence, to endeavour to  explain the production of colours or sounds, by figure, motion,  magnitude, and the like, must needs be labour in vain. And accordingly we  see the attempts of that kind are not at all satisfactory. Which may be  said in general of those instances wherein one idea or quality is  assigned for the cause of another. I need not say how many hypotheses and  speculations are left out, and how much the study of nature is abridged  by this doctrine.    103. ATTRACTION SIGNIFIES THE EFFECT, NOT THE MANNER OR CAUSE.--The great  mechanical principle now in vogue is attraction. That a stone  falls to the earth, or the sea swells towards the moon, may to some  appear sufficiently explained thereby. But how are we enlightened by  being told this is done by attraction? Is it that that word signifies the  manner of the tendency, and that it is by the mutual drawing of bodies  instead of their being impelled or protruded towards each other? But,  nothing is determined of the manner or action, and it may as truly (for  aught we know) be termed \"impulse,\" or \"protrusion,\" as \"attraction.\"  Again, the parts of steel we see cohere firmly together, and this also is  accounted for by attraction; but, in this as in the other instances, I do  not perceive that anything is signified besides the effect itself; for as  to the manner of the action whereby it is produced, or the cause which  produces it, these are not so much as aimed at.    104. Indeed, if we take a view of the several phenomena, and compare them  together, we may observe some likeness and conformity between them. For  example, in the falling of a stone to the ground, in the rising of the  sea towards the moon, in cohesion, crystallization, etc, there is  something alike, namely, an union or mutual approach of bodies. So that  any one of these or the like phenomena may not seem strange or surprising  to a man who has nicely observed and compared the effects of nature. For  that only is thought so which is uncommon, or a thing by itself, and out  of the ordinary course of our observation. That bodies should tend  towards the centre of the earth is not thought strange, because it is  what we perceive every moment of our lives. But, that they should have a  like gravitation towards the centre of the moon may seem odd and  unaccountable to most men, because it is discerned only in the tides. But  a philosopher, whose thoughts take in a larger compass of nature, having  observed a certain similitude of appearances, as well in the heavens as  the earth, that argue innumerable bodies to have a mutual tendency  towards each other, which he denotes by the general name \"attraction,\"  whatever can be reduced to that he thinks justly accounted for. Thus he  explains the tides by the attraction of the terraqueous globe towards the  moon, which to him does not appear odd or anomalous, but only a  particular example of a general rule or law of nature.    105. If therefore we consider the difference there is betwixt natural  philosophers and other men, with regard to their knowledge of the  phenomena, we shall find it consists not in an exacter knowledge of the  efficient cause that produces them--for that can be no other than the  will of a spirit--but only in a greater largeness of comprehension,  whereby analogies, harmonies, and agreements are discovered in the works  of nature, and the particular effects explained, that is, reduced to  general rules, see sect. 62, which rules, grounded on the analogy and  uniformness observed in the production of natural effects, are most  agreeable and sought after by the mind; for that they extend our prospect  beyond what is present and near to us, and enable us to make very  probable conjectures touching things that may have happened at very great  distances of time and place, as well as to predict things to come; which  sort of endeavour towards omniscience is much affected by the mind.    106. CAUTION AS TO THE USE OF ANALOGIES.--But we should proceed warily  in such things, for we are apt to lay too great stress on analogies,  and, to the prejudice of truth, humour that eagerness of the mind  whereby it is carried to extend its knowledge into general theorems.  For example, in the business of gravitation or mutual attraction,  because it appears in many instances, some are straightway for  pronouncing it universal; and that to attract and be attracted  by every other body is an essential quality inherent in all bodies  whatsoever. Whereas it is evident the fixed stars have no such  tendency towards each other; and, so far is that gravitation from being  essential to bodies that in some instances a quite contrary principle  seems to show itself; as in the perpendicular growth of plants, and the  elasticity of the air. There is nothing necessary or essential in the  case, but it depends entirely on the will of the Governing Spirit, who  causes certain bodies to cleave together or tend towards each other  according to various laws, whilst He keeps others at a fixed distance;  and to some He gives a quite contrary tendency to fly asunder just as He  sees convenient.    107. After what has been premised, I think we may lay down the following  conclusions. First, it is plain philosophers amuse themselves in vain,  when they inquire for any natural efficient cause, distinct from a mind  or spirit. Secondly, considering the whole creation is the workmanship of  a wise and good Agent, it should seem to become philosophers to employ  their thoughts (contrary to what some hold) about the final causes of  things; and I confess I see no reason why pointing out the various ends  to which natural things are adapted, and for which they were originally  with unspeakable wisdom contrived, should not be thought one good way of  accounting for them, and altogether worthy a philosopher. Thirdly, from  what has been premised no reason can be drawn why the history of nature  should not still be studied, and observations and experiments made,  which, that they are of use to mankind, and enable us to draw any general  conclusions, is not the result of any immutable habitudes or relations  between things themselves, but only of God's goodness and kindness to men  in the administration of the world. See sect. 30 and 31 Fourthly, by a  diligent observation of the phenomena within our view, we may discover  the general laws of nature, and from them deduce the other phenomena; I  do not say demonstrate, for all deductions of that kind depend on a  supposition that the Author of nature always operates uniformly, and in a  constant observance of those rules we take for principles: which we  cannot evidently know.    108.
