The distance from Kay's to the town was a mile and a half. If he  started at the hour when he should have been starting for the school  house, he would arrive just in time to see the curtain go up.    Having settled these facts definitely in his mind, he got his books  together and went over to school.          XV    DOWN TOWN      Fenn arrived at the theatre a quarter of an hour before the curtain  rose. Going down a gloomy alley of the High Street, he found himself  at the stage door, where he made inquiries of a depressed-looking man  with a bad cold in the head as to the whereabouts of his brother. It  seemed that he was with Mr Higgs. If he would wait, said the  door-keeper, his name should be sent up. Fenn waited, while the  door-keeper made polite conversation by describing his symptoms to him  in a hoarse growl. Presently the minion who had been despatched to the  upper regions with Fenn's message returned. Would he go upstairs,  third door on the left. Fenn followed the instructions, and found  himself in a small room, a third of which was filled by a huge  iron-bound chest, another third by a very stout man and a  dressing-table, while the rest of the space was comparatively empty,  being occupied by a wooden chair with three legs. On this seat his  brother was trying to balance himself, giving what part of his  attention was not required for this feat to listening to some story  the fat man was telling him. Fenn had heard his deep voice booming as  he went up the passage.    His brother did the honours.    \"Glad to see you, glad to see you,\" said Mr Higgs, for the fat man was  none other than that celebrity. \"Take a seat.\"    Fenn sat down on the chest and promptly tore his trousers on a jagged  piece of iron.    \"These provincial dressing-rooms!\" said Mr Higgs, by way of comment.  \"No room! Never any room! No chairs! Nothing!\"    He spoke in short, quick sentences, and gasped between each. Fenn said  it really didn't matter--he was quite comfortable.    \"Haven't they done anything about it?\" asked Fenn's brother, resuming  the conversation which Fenn's entrance had interrupted. \"We've been  having a burglary here,\" he explained. \"Somebody got into the theatre  last night through a window. I don't know what they expected to find.\"    \"Why,\" said Fenn, \"we've had a burglar up our way too. Chap broke into  the school house and went through the old man's drawing-room. The  school house men have been talking about nothing else ever since. I  wonder if it's the same crew.\"    Mr Higgs turned in his chair, and waved a stick of grease paint  impressively to emphasise his point.    \"There,\" he said. \"There! What I've been saying all along. No doubt of  it. Organised gang. And what are the police doing? Nothing, sir,  nothing. Making inquiries. Rot! What's the good of inquiries?\"    Fenn's brother suggested mildly that inquiries were a good beginning.  You _must_ start somehow. Mr Higgs scouted the idea.    \"There ought not to be any doubt, sir. They ought to _know_. To  KNOW,\" he added, with firmness.    At this point there filtered through the closed doors the strains of  the opening chorus.    \"By Jove, it's begun!\" said Fenn's brother. \"Come on, Bob.\"    \"Where are we going to?\" asked Fenn, as he followed. \"The wings?\"    But it seemed that the rules of Mr Higgs' company prevented any  outsider taking up his position in that desirable quarter. The only  place from which it was possible to watch the performance, except by  going to the front of the house, was the \"flies,\" situated near the  roof of the building.    Fenn found all the pleasures of novelty in watching the players from  this lofty position. Judged by the cold light of reason, it was not  the best place from which to see a play. It was possible to gain only  a very foreshortened view of the actors. But it was a change after  sitting \"in front\".    The piece was progressing merrily. The gifted author, at first silent  and pale, began now to show signs of gratification. Now and again he  chuckled as some _jeu de mots_ hit the mark and drew a quick gust  of laughter from the unseen audience. Occasionally he would nudge Fenn  to draw his attention to some good bit of dialogue which was  approaching. He was obviously enjoying himself.    The advent of Mr Higgs completed his satisfaction, for the audience  greeted the comedian with roars of applause. As a rule Eckleton took  its drama through the medium of third-rate touring companies, which  came down with plays that had not managed to attract London to any  great extent, and were trying to make up for failures in the  metropolis by long tours in the provinces. It was seldom that an actor  of the Higgs type paid the town a visit, and in a play, too, which had  positively never appeared before on any stage. Eckleton appreciated  the compliment.    \"Listen,\" said Fenn's brother. \"Isn't that just the part for him? It's  just like he was in the dressing-room, eh? Short sentences and  everything. The funny part of it is that I didn't know the man when I  wrote the play. It was all luck.\"    Mr Higgs' performance sealed the success of the piece. The house  laughed at everything he said. He sang a song in his gasping way, and  they laughed still more. Fenn's brother became incoherent with  delight. The verdict of Eckleton was hardly likely to affect London  theatre-goers, but it was very pleasant notwithstanding. Like every  playwright with his first piece, he had been haunted by the idea that  his dialogue \"would not act\", that, however humorous it might be to a  reader, it would fall flat when spoken. There was no doubt now as to  whether the lines sounded well.    At the beginning of the second act the great Higgs was not on the  stage, Fenn's brother knowing enough of the game not to bring on his  big man too soon. He had not to enter for ten minutes or so. The  author, who had gone down to see him during the interval, stayed in  the dressing-room. Fenn, however, who wanted to see all of the piece  that he could, went up to the \"flies\" again.    It occurred to him when he got there that he would see more if he took  the seat which his brother had been occupying. It would give him much  the same view of the stage, and a wider view of the audience. He  thought it would be amusing to see how the audience looked from the  \"flies\".    Mr W. S. Gilbert once wrote a poem about a certain bishop who, while  fond of amusing himself, objected to his clergy doing likewise. And  the consequence was that whenever he did so amuse himself, he was  always haunted by a phantom curate, who joined him in his pleasures,  much to his dismay. On one occasion he stopped to watch a Punch and  Judy show,        And heard, as Punch was being treated penally,      That phantom curate laughing all hyaenally.    The disgust and panic of this eminent cleric was as nothing compared  with that of Fenn, when, shifting to his brother's seat, he got the  first clear view he had had of the audience. In a box to the left of  the dress-circle sat, \"laughing all hyaenally\", the following  distinguished visitors:        Mr Mulholland of No. 7 College Buildings.      Mr Raynes of No. 4 ditto,        and      Mr Kay.    Fenn drew back like a flash, knocking his chair over as he did so.    \"Giddy, sir?\" said a stage hand, pleasantly. \"Bless you, lots of gents  is like that when they comes up here. Can't stand the 'eight, they  can't. You'll be all right in a jiffy.\"    \"Yes. It--it is rather high, isn't it?\" said Fenn. \"Awful glare, too.\"    He picked up his chair and sat down well out of sight of the box. Had  they seen him? he wondered. Then common sense returned to him. They  could not possibly have seen him. Apart from any other reasons, he had  only been in his brother's seat for half-a-dozen seconds. No. He was  all right so far. But he would have to get back to the house, and at  once. With three of the staff, including his own house-master, ranging  the town, things were a trifle too warm for comfort. He wondered it  had not occurred to him that, with a big attraction at the theatre,  some of the staff might feel an inclination to visit it.    He did not stop to say goodbye to his brother. Descending from his  perch, he hurried to the stage door.    \"It's in the toobs that I feel it, sir.\" said the door-keeper, as he  let him out, resuming their conversation as if they had only just  parted. Fenn hurried off without waiting to hear more.    It was drizzling outside, and there was a fog. Not a \"London  particular\", but quite thick enough to make it difficult to see where  one was going. People and vehicles passed him, vague phantoms in the  darkness. Occasionally the former collided with him. He began to wish  he had not accepted his brother's invitation. The unexpected sight of  the three masters had shaken his nerve. Till then only the romantic,  adventurous side of the expedition had struck him. Now the risks began  to loom larger in his mind. It was all very well, he felt, to think, as  he had done, that he would be expelled if found out, but that all the  same he would risk it. Detection then had seemed a remote contingency.  With three masters in the offing it became at least a possibility. The  melancholy case of Peter Brown seemed to him now to have a more  personal significance for him.    Wrapped in these reflections, he lost his way.    He did not realise this for some time. It was borne in upon him when  the road he was taking suddenly came to an abrupt end in a blank wall.  Instead of being, as he had fancied, in the High Street, he must have  branched off into some miserable blind alley.    More than ever he wished he had not come. Eckleton was not a town that  took up a great deal of room on the map of England, but it made up for  small dimensions by the eccentricity with which it had been laid out.  On a dark and foggy night, to one who knew"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6879"],[0,"The Gold Bat (#16)"],[1," instead of him? Strachan is a good wing.\"    Trevor shook his head.    \"No. There's nobody good enough to play back for the first. We mustn't  risk it.\"    \"Then I suppose it must be Rand-Brown?\"    \"I suppose so.\"    \"He may do better than we think. He played quite a decent game today.  That try he got wasn't half a bad one.\"    \"He'd be all right if he didn't funk. But perhaps he wouldn't funk  against Ripton. In a match like that anybody would play up. I'll ask  Milton and Allardyce about it.\"    \"I shouldn't go to Milton today,\" said Clowes. \"I fancy he'll want a  night's rest before he's fit to talk to. He must be a bit sick about  this match. I know he expected Seymour's to win.\"    He went out, but came back almost immediately.    \"I say,\" he said, \"there's one thing that's just occurred to me.  This'll please the League. I mean, this ankle business of Barry's.\"    The same idea had struck Trevor. It was certainly a respite. But he  regretted it for all that. What he wanted was to beat Ripton, and  Barry's absence would weaken the team. However, it was good in its way,  and cleared the atmosphere for the time. The League would hardly do  anything with regard to the carrying out of their threat while Barry  was on the sick-list.    Next day, having given him time to get over the bitterness of defeat  in accordance with Clowes' thoughtful suggestion, Trevor called on  Milton, and asked him what his opinion was on the subject of the  inclusion of Rand-Brown in the first fifteen in place of Barry.    \"He's the next best man,\" he added, in defence of the proposal.    \"I suppose so,\" said Milton. \"He'd better play, I suppose. There's no  one else.\"    \"Clowes thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to shove Strachan on the  wing, and put somebody else back.\"    \"Who is there to put?\"    \"Jervis?\"    \"Not good enough. No, it's better to be weakish on the wing than at  back. Besides, Rand-Brown may do all right. He played well against  you.\"    \"Yes,\" said Trevor. \"Study looks a bit better now,\" he added, as he was  going, having looked round the room. \"Still a bit bare, though.\"    Milton sighed. \"It will never be what it was.\"    \"Forty-three theatrical photographs want some replacing, of course,\"  said Trevor. \"But it isn't bad, considering.\"    \"How's yours?\"    \"Oh, mine's all right, except for the absence of photographs.\"    \"I say, Trevor.\"    \"Yes?\" said Trevor, stopping at the door. Milton's voice had taken on  the tone of one who is about to disclose dreadful secrets.    \"Would you like to know what I think?\"    \"What?\"    \"Why, I'm pretty nearly sure who it was that ragged my study?\"    \"By Jove! What have you done to him?\"    \"Nothing as yet. I'm not quite sure of my man.\"    \"Who is the man?\"    \"Rand-Brown.\"    \"By Jove! Clowes once said he thought Rand-Brown must be the President  of the League. But then, I don't see how you can account for _my_  study being wrecked. He was out on the field when it was done.\"    \"Why, the League, of course. You don't suppose he's the only man in it?  There must be a lot of them.\"    \"But what makes you think it was Rand-Brown?\"    Milton told him the story of Shoeblossom, as Barry had told it to him.  The only difference was that Trevor listened without any of the  scepticism which Milton had displayed on hearing it. He was getting  excited. It all fitted in so neatly. If ever there was circumstantial  evidence against a man, here it was against Rand-Brown. Take the two  cases. Milton had quarrelled with him. Milton's study was wrecked \"with  the compliments of the League\". Trevor had turned him out of the first  fifteen. Trevor's study was wrecked \"with the compliments of the  League\". As Clowes had pointed out, the man with the most obvious  motive for not wishing Barry to play for the school was Rand-Brown. It  seemed a true bill.    \"I shouldn't wonder if you're right,\" he said, \"but of course one can't  do anything yet. You want a lot more evidence. Anyhow, we must play him  against Ripton, I suppose. Which is his study? I'll go and tell him  now.\"    \"Ten.\"    Trevor knocked at the door of study Ten. Rand-Brown was sitting over  the fire, reading. He jumped up when he saw that it was Trevor who had  come in, and to his visitor it seemed that his face wore a guilty look.    \"What do you want?\" said Rand-Brown.    It was not the politest way of welcoming a visitor. It increased  Trevor's suspicions. The man was afraid. A great idea darted into his  mind. Why not go straight to the point and have it out with him here  and now? He had the League's letter about the bat in his pocket. He  would confront him with it and insist on searching the study there and  then. If Rand-Brown were really, as he suspected, the writer of the  letter, the bat must be in this room somewhere. Search it now, and he  would have no time to hide it. He pulled out the letter.    \"I believe you wrote that,\" he said.    Trevor was always direct.    Rand-Brown seemed to turn a little pale, but his voice when he replied  was quite steady.    \"That's a lie,\" he said.    \"Then, perhaps,\" said Trevor, \"you wouldn't object to proving it.\"    \"How?\"    \"By letting me search your study?\"    \"You don't believe my word?\"    \"Why should I? You don't believe mine.\"    Rand-Brown made no comment on this remark.    \"Was that what you came here for?\" he asked.    \"No,\" said Trevor; \"as a matter of fact, I came to tell you to turn out  for running and passing with the first tomorrow afternoon. You're  playing against Ripton on Saturday.\"    Rand-Brown's attitude underwent a complete transformation at the news.  He became friendliness itself.    \"All right,\" he said. \"I say, I'm sorry I said what I did about lying.  I was rather sick that you should think I wrote that rot you showed me.  I hope you don't mind.\"    \"Not a bit. Do you mind my searching your study?\"    For a moment Rand-Brown looked vicious. Then he sat down with a laugh.    \"Go on,\" he said; \"I see you don't believe me. Here are the keys if you  want them.\"    Trevor thanked him, and took the keys. He opened every drawer and  examined the writing-desk. The bat was in none of these places. He  looked in the cupboards. No bat there.    \"Like to take up the carpet?\" inquired Rand-Brown.    \"No, thanks.\"    \"Search me if you like. Shall I turn out my pockets?\"    \"Yes, please,\" said Trevor, to his surprise. He had not expected to be  taken literally.    Rand-Brown emptied them, but the bat was not there. Trevor turned to  go.    \"You've not looked inside the legs of the chairs yet,\" said Rand-Brown.  \"They may be hollow. There's no knowing.\"    \"It doesn't matter, thanks,\" said Trevor. \"Sorry for troubling you.  Don't forget tomorrow afternoon.\"    And he went, with the very unpleasant feeling that he had been badly  scored off.          XVI    THE RIPTON MATCH      It was a curious thing in connection with the matches between Ripton  and Wrykyn, that Ripton always seemed to be the bigger team. They  always had a gigantic pack of forwards, who looked capable of shoving a  hole through one of the pyramids. Possibly they looked bigger to the  Wrykinians than they really were. Strangers always look big on the  football field. When you have grown accustomed to a person's  appearance, he does not look nearly so large. Milton, for instance,  never struck anybody at Wrykyn as being particularly big for a school  forward, and yet today he was the heaviest man on the field by a  quarter of a stone. But, taken in the mass, the Ripton pack were far  heavier than their rivals. There was a legend current among the lower  forms at Wrykyn that fellows were allowed to stop on at Ripton till  they were twenty-five, simply to play football. This is scarcely likely  to have been based on fact. Few lower form legends are.    Jevons, the Ripton captain, through having played opposite Trevor for  three seasons--he was the Ripton left centre-three-quarter--had come to  be quite an intimate of his. Trevor had gone down with Milton and  Allardyce to meet the team at the station, and conduct them up to the  school.    \"How have you been getting on since Christmas?\" asked Jevons.    \"Pretty well. We've lost Paget, I suppose you know?\"    \"That was the fast man on the wing, wasn't it?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, we've lost a man, too.\"    \"Oh, yes, that red-haired forward. I remember him.\"    \"It ought to make us pretty even. What's the ground like?\"    \"Bit greasy, I should think. We had some rain late last night.\"    The ground _was_ a bit greasy. So was the ball. When Milton kicked  off up the hill with what wind there was in his favour, the outsides of  both teams found it difficult to hold the ball. Jevons caught it on his  twenty-five line, and promptly handed it forward. The first scrum was  formed in the heart of the enemy's country.    A deep, swelling roar from either touch-line greeted the school's  advantage. A feature of a big match was always the shouting. It rarely  ceased throughout the whole course of the game, the monotonous but  impressive sound of five hundred voices all shouting the same word. It  was worth hearing. Sometimes the evenness of the noise would change to  an excited _crescendo_ as a school three-quarter got off, or the  school back pulled up the attack with a fine piece of defence.  Sometimes the shouting would give place to clapping when the school was  being pressed and somebody had found touch with a long kick. But mostly  the man on the ropes roared steadily and without cessation, and with  the full force of his lungs, the word \"_Wrykyn!_\"    The scrum was a long one. For two minutes the forwards heaved and  strained, now one side, now the other, gaining a few inches. The Wrykyn  pack were doing all they knew to heel, but their opponents' superior  weight was telling. Ripton had got the ball, and were keeping it. Their  game was to break through with it and rush. Then suddenly one of their  forwards kicked it on, and just at that moment the"]]]
