[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891"],[0,"Travels in West Africa: Congo Fran√ßais, Corisco and Cameroons (#16)"],[1," get to Lagos, when you strike the greatest of  them all: --the swamps of the Niger outfalls (about twenty-three  rivers in all) and of the Sombreiro, New Calabar, Bonny, San  Antonio, Opobo (false and true), Kwoibo, Old Calabar (with the Cross  Akwayafe Qwa Rivers) and Rio del Rey Rivers.  The whole of this  great stretch of coast is a mangrove-swamp, each river silently  rolling down its great mass of mud-laden waters and constituting  each in itself a very pretty problem to the navigator by its network  of intercommunicating creeks, and the sand and mud bar which it  forms off its entrance by dropping its heaviest mud; its lighter mud  is carried out beyond its bar and makes the nasty-smelling brown  soup of the South Atlantic Ocean, with froth floating in lines and  patches on it, for miles to seaward.    In this great region of swamps every mile appears like every other  mile until you get well used to it, and are able to distinguish the  little local peculiarities at the entrance of the rivers and in the  winding of the creeks, a thing difficult even for the most  experienced navigator to do during those thick wool-like mists  called smokes, which hang about the whole Bight from November till  May (the dry season), sometimes lasting all day, sometimes clearing  off three hours after sunrise.    The upper or north-westerly part of the swamp is round the mouths of  the Niger, and it successfully concealed this fact from geographers  down to 1830, when the series of heroic journeys made by Mungo Park,  Clapperton, and the two Landers finally solved the problem--a  problem that was as great and which cost more men's lives than even  the discovery of the sources of the Nile.    That this should have been so may seem very strange to us who now  have been told the answer to the riddle; for the upper waters of  this great river were known of before Christ and spoken of by  Herodotus, Pliny and Ptolemy, and its mouths navigated continuously  along by the seaboard by trading vessels since the fifteenth  century, but they were not recognised as belonging to the Niger.  Some geographers held that the Senegal or the Gambia was its  outfall; others that it was the Zaire (Congo); others that it did  not come out on the West Coast at all, but got mixed up with the  Nile in the middle of the continent, and so on.  Yet when you come  to know the swamps this is not so strange.  You find on going up  what looks like a big river--say Forcados, two and a half miles wide  at the entrance and a real bit of the Niger.  Before you are up it  far great, broad, business-like-looking river entrances open on  either side, showing wide rivers mangrove-walled, but two-thirds of  them are utter frauds which will ground you within half an hour of  your entering them.  Some few of them do communicate with other main  channels to the great upper river, and others are main channels  themselves; but most of them intercommunicate with each other and  lead nowhere in particular, and you can't even get there because of  their shallowness.  It is small wonder that the earlier navigators  did not get far up them in sailing ships, and that the problem had  to be solved by men descending the main stream of the Niger before  it commences to what we in Devonshire should call \"squander itself  about\" in all these channels.  And in addition it must be remembered  that the natives with whom these trading vessels dealt, first for  slaves, afterwards for palm-oil, were not, and are not now, members  of the Lo family of savages.  Far from it:  they do not go in for  \"gentle smiles,\" but for murdering any unprotected boat's crew they  happen to come across, not only for a love of sport but to keep  white traders from penetrating to the trade-producing interior, and  spoiling prices.  And the region is practically foodless.    The rivers of the great mangrove-swamp from the Sombreiro to the Rio  del Rey are now known pretty surely not to be branches of the Niger,  but the upper regions of this part of the Bight are much neglected  by English explorers.  I believe the great swamp region of the Bight  of Biafra is the greatest in the world, and that in its immensity  and gloom it has a grandeur equal to that of the Himalayas.    Take any man, educated or not, and place him on Bonny or Forcados  River in the wet season on a Sunday--Bonny for choice.  Forcados is  good.  You'll keep Forcados scenery \"indelibly limned on the tablets  of your mind when a yesterday has faded from its page,\" after you  have spent even a week waiting for the Lagos branch-boat on its inky  waters.  But Bonny!  Well, come inside the bar and anchor off the  factories:  seaward there is the foam of the bar gleaming and wicked  white against a leaden sky and what there is left of Breaker Island.  In every other direction you will see the apparently endless walls  of mangrove, unvarying in colour, unvarying in form, unvarying in  height, save from perspective.  Beneath and between you and them lie  the rotting mud waters of Bonny River, and away up and down river,  miles of rotting mud waters fringed with walls of rotting mud  mangrove-swamp.  The only break in them--one can hardly call it a  relief to the scenery--are the gaunt black ribs of the old hulks,  once used as trading stations, which lie exposed at low water near  the shore, protruding like the skeletons of great unclean beasts who  have died because Bonny water was too strong even for them.    Raised on piles from the mud shore you will see the white-painted  factories and their great store-houses for oil; each factory likely  enough with its flag at half-mast, which does not enliven the  scenery either, for you know it is because somebody is \"dead again.\"  Throughout and over all is the torrential downpour of the wet-season  rain, coming down night and day with its dull roar.  I have known it  rain six mortal weeks in Bonny River, just for all the world as if  it were done by machinery, and the interval that came then was only  a few wet days, where-after it settled itself down to work again in  the good West Coast waterspout pour for more weeks.    While your eyes are drinking in the characteristics of Bonny scenery  you notice a peculiar smell--an intensification of that smell you  noticed when nearing Bonny, in the evening, out at sea.  That's the  breath of the malarial mud, laden with fever, and the chances are  you will be down to-morrow.  If it is near evening time now, you can  watch it becoming incarnate, creeping and crawling and gliding out  from the side creeks and between the mangrove-roots, laying itself  upon the river, stretching and rolling in a kind of grim play, and  finally crawling up the side of the ship to come on board and leave  its cloak of moisture that grows green mildew in a few hours over  all.  Noise you will not be much troubled with:  there is only that  rain, a sound I have known make men who are sick with fever well-  nigh mad, and now and again the depressing cry of the curlews which  abound here.  This combination is such that after six or eight hours  of it you will be thankful to hear your shipmates start to work the  winch.  I take it you are hard up when you relish a winch.  And you  will say--let your previous experience of the world be what it may--  Good Heavens, what a place!    Five times have I been now in Bonny River and I like it.  You always  do get to like it if you live long enough to allow the strange  fascination of the place to get a hold on you; but when I first  entered it, on a ship commanded by Captain Murray in '93, in the wet  season, i.e. in August, in spite of the confidence I had by this  time acquired in his skill and knowledge of the West Coast, a sense  of horror seized on me as I gazed upon the scene, and I said to the  old Coaster who then had charge of my education, \"Good Heavens! what  an awful accident.  We've gone and picked up the Styx.\"  He was  evidently hurt and said, \"Bonny was a nice place when you got used  to it,\" and went on to discourse on the last epidemic here, when  nine men out of the resident eleven died in about ten days from  yellow fever.  Next to the scenery of \"a River,\" commend me for  cheerfulness to the local conversation of its mangrove-swamp region;  and every truly important West African river has its mangrove-swamp  belt, which extends inland as far as the tide waters make it  brackish, and which has a depth and extent from the banks depending  on the configuration of the country.  Above this belt comes  uniformly a region of high forest, having towards the river frontage  clay cliffs, sometimes high, as in the case of the Old Calabar at  Adiabo, more frequently dwarf cliffs, as in the Forcados up at  Warree, and in the Ogowe,--for a long stretch through Kama country.  After the clay cliffs region you come to a region of rapids, caused  by the river cutting its way through a mountain range; such ranges  are the Pallaballa, causing the Livingstone rapids of the Congo; the  Sierra del Cristal, those of the Ogowe, and many lesser rivers; the  Rumby and Omon ranges, those of the Old Calabar and Cross Rivers.    Naturally in different parts these separate regions vary in size.  The mangrove-swamp may be only a fringe at the mouth of the river,  or it may cover hundreds of square miles.  The clay cliffs may  extend for only a mile or so along the bank, or they may, as on the  Ogowe, extend for 130.  And so it is also with the rapids:  in some  rivers, for instance the Cameroons, there are only a few miles of  them, in others there are many miles; in the Ogowe there are as many  as 500; and these rapids may be close to the river mouth, as in most  of the Gold Coast rivers, save the Ancobra and the Volta; or they  may be far in the interior, as in the Cross River, where they  commence at about 200 miles; and on the Ogowe, where they commence  at about 208 miles from the sea coast; this depends on the nearness  or remoteness from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],[0,"Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#16)"],[1," did something to save him here,  reinforcing natural cheerfulness and the warm desire to give pleasure.  His excessive elaboration of style, which grew upon him more and more,  giving throughout often a sense of extreme artificiality and of the self-  consciousness usually bred of it, is but another incidental proof of  this.  And let no reader think that I wish here to decry R. L. Stevenson.  I only desire faithfully to try to understand him, and to indicate the  class or group to which his genius and temperament really belong.  He is  from first to last the idealistic dreamy or mystical romancer, and not  the true idealist or dealer direct with life or character for its own  sake.  The very beauty and sweetness of his spirit in one way militated  against his dramatic success--he really did not believe in villains, and  always made them better than they should have been, and that, too, on the  very side where wickedness--their natural wickedness--is most  available--on the stage.  The dreamer of dreams and the Shorter  Catechist, strangely united together, were here directly at odds with the  creative power, and crossed and misdirected it, and the casuist came in  and manoeuvred the limelight--all too like the old devil of the mediaeval  drama, who was made only to be laughed at and taken lightly, a buffoon  and a laughing-stock indeed.  And while he could unveil villainy, as is  the case pre-eminently in Huish in the _Ebb-Tide_, he shrank from  inflicting the punishments for which untutored human nature looks, and  thus he lost one great aid to crude dramatic effect.  As to his poems,  they are intimately personal in his happiest moments: he deals with  separate moods and sentiments, and scarcely ever touches those of a type  alien to his own.  The defect of his child poems is distinctly that he is  everywhere strictly recalling and reproducing his own quaint and wholly  exceptional childhood; and children, ordinary, normal, healthy children,  will not take to these poems (though grown-ups largely do so), as they  would to, say, the _Lilliput Levee_ of my old friend, W. B. Rands.  Rands  showed a great deal of true dramatic play there within his own very  narrow limits, as, at all events, adults must conceive them.    Even in his greatest works, in _The Master of Ballantrae_ and _Weir of  Hermiston_, the special power in Stevenson really lies in subduing his  characters at the most critical point for action, to make them prove or  sustain his thesis; and in this way the rare effect that he might have  secured _dramatically_ is largely lost and make-believe substituted, as  in the Treasure Search in the end of _The Master of Ballantrae_.  The  powerful dramatic effect he might have had in his _denouement_ is thus  completely sacrificed.  The essence of the drama for the stage is that  the work is for this and this alone--dialogue and everything being only  worked rightly when it bears on, aids, and finally secures this in happy  completeness.    In a word, you always, in view of true dramatic effect, see Stevenson  himself too clearly behind his characters.  The \"fine speeches\" Mr Pinero  referred to trace to the intrusion behind the glass of a  part-quicksilvered portion, which cunningly shows, when the glass is  moved about, Stevenson himself behind the character, as we have said  already.  For long he shied dealing with women, as though by a true  instinct.  Unfortunately for him his image was as clear behind  _Catriona_, with the discerning, as anywhere else; and this, alas! too  far undid her as an independent, individual character, though traits like  those in her author were attractive.  The constant effort to relieve the  sense of this affords him the most admirable openings for the display of  his exquisite style, of which he seldom or never fails to make the very  most in this regard; but the necessity laid upon him to aim at securing a  sense of relief by this is precisely the same as led him to write the  overfine speeches in the plays, as Mr Pinero found and pointed out at  Edinburgh: both defeat the true end, but in the written book mere art of  style and a naivete and a certain sweetness of temper conceal the lack of  nature and creative spontaneity; while on the stage the descriptions,  saving reflections and fine asides, are ruthlessly cut away under sheer  stage necessities, or, if left, but hinder the action; and art of this  kind does not there suffice to conceal the lack of nature.    More clearly to bring out my meaning here and draw aid from comparative  illustration, let me take my old friend of many years, Charles Gibbon.  Gibbon was poor, very poor, in intellectual subtlety compared with  Stevenson; he had none of his sweet, quaint, original fancy; he was no  casuist; he was utterly void of power in the subdued humorous twinkle or  genial by-play in which Stevenson excelled.  But he has more of dramatic  power, pure and simple, than Stevenson had--his novels--the best of  them--would far more easily yield themselves to the ordinary purposes of  the ordinary playwright.  Along with conscientiousness, perception,  penetration, with the dramatist must go a certain indescribable common-  sense commonplaceness--if I may name it so--protection against vagary and  that over-refined egotism and self-confession which is inimical to the  drama and in which the Stevensonian type all too largely abounds for  successful dramatic production.  Mr Henley perhaps put it too strongly  when he said that what was supremely of interest to R. L. Stevenson was  Stevenson himself; but he indicates the tendency, and that tendency is  inimical to strong, broad, effective and varied dramatic presentation.  Water cannot rise above its own level; nor can minds of this type go  freely out of themselves in a grandly healthy, unconscious, and  unaffected way, and this is the secret of the dramatic spirit, if it be  not, as Shelley said, the secret of morals, which Stevenson, when he  passed away, was but on the way to attain.  As we shall see, he had risen  so far above it, subdued it, triumphed over it, that we really cannot  guess what he might have attained had but more years been given him.  For  the last attainment of the loftiest and truest genius is precisely  this--to gain such insight of the real that all else becomes subsidiary.  True simplicity and the abiding relief and enduring power of true art  with all classes lies here and not elsewhere.  Cleverness, refinement,  fancy, and invention, even sublety of intellect, are practically nowhere  in this sphere without this.          CHAPTER XIV--STEVENSON AS DRAMATIST      In opposition to Mr Pinero, therefore, I assert that Stevenson's defect  in spontaneous dramatic presentation is seen clearly in his novels as  well as in his plays proper.    In writing to my good friend, Mr Thomas M'Kie, Advocate, Edinburgh,  telling him of my work on R. L. Stevenson and the results, I thus  gathered up in little the broad reflections on this point, and I may  perhaps be excused quoting the following passages, as they reinforce by a  new reference or illustration or two what has just been said:       \"Considering his great keenness and force on some sides, I find R. L.     Stevenson markedly deficient in grip on other sides--common sides,     after all, of human nature.  This was so far largely due to a dreamy,     mystical, so far perverted and, so to say, often even inverted     casuistical, fatalistic morality, which would not allow him scope in     what Carlyle would have called a healthy hatred of fools and     scoundrels; with both of which classes--vagabonds in strictness--he     had rather too much of a sneaking sympathy.  Mr Pinero was     wrong--totally and incomprehensibly wrong--when he told the good folks     of Edinburgh at the Philosophical Institution, and afterwards at the     London Birkbeck Institution, that it was lack of concentration and     care that made R. L. Stevenson a failure as a dramatist.  No: it was     here and not elsewhere that the failure lay.  R. L. Stevenson was     himself an unconscious paradox--and sometimes he realised it--his     great weakness from this point of view being that he wished to show     strong and original by making the villain the hero of the piece as     well.  Now, _that_, if it may, by clever manipulation and dexterity,     be made to do in a novel, most certainly it will not do on the     stage--more especially if it is done consciously and, as it were, of     _malice prepense_; because, for one thing, there is in the theatre a     very varied yet united audience which has to give a simultaneous and     immediate verdict--an audience not inclined to some kinds of     overwrought subtleties and casuistries, however clever the technique.     If _The Master of Ballantrae_ (which has some highly dramatic scenes     and situations, if it is not in itself substantially a drama) were to     be put on the stage, the playwright, if wisely determined for success,     would really have--not in details, but in essential conception--to     kick R. L. Stevenson in his most personal aim out of it, and take and     present a more definite moral view of the two villain-heroes     (brothers, too); improve and elevate the one a bit if he lowered the     other, and not wobble in sympathy and try to make the audience wobble     in sympathy also, as R. L. Stevenson certainly does.  As for _Beau     Austin_, it most emphatically, in view of this, should be re-writ--re-     writ especially towards the ending--and the scandalous Beau tarred and     feathered, metaphorically speaking, instead of walking off at the end     in a sneaking, mincing sort of way, with no more than a little     momentary twinge of discomfort at the wreck and ruin he has wrought,     for having acted as a selfish, snivelling poltroon and coward, though     in fine clothes and with fine ways and fine manners, which only, from     our point of view, make"]]]
