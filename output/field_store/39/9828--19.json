Lo! these are the three parts of man:  reason, desire, aversion; in which all his works are done. These,  therefore, must be slain by these three exercises, God's governance,  our self-mortification, the hurt done to us by others; and so they must  spiritually rest before God, and give Him room for His works.    XXIV. But such works are to be done and such sufferings to be endured  in faith and in sure confidence of God's favor, in order that, as has  been said, all works remain in the First Commandment and in faith, and  that faith, for the sake of which all other commandments and works are  ordained, exercise and strengthen itself in them. See, therefore, what  a pretty, golden ring these three Commandments and their works  naturally form, and how from the First Commandment and faith the Second  flows on to the Third, and the Third in turn drives through the Second  up into the First. For the first work is to believe, to have a good  heart and confidence toward God. From this flows the second good work,  to praise God's Name, to confess His grace, to give all honor to Him  alone. Then follows the third, to worship by praying, hearing God's  Word, thinking of and considering God's benefits, and in addition  chastising one's self, and keeping the body under.    But when the evil spirit perceives such faith, such honoring of God and  such worship, he rages and stirs up persecution, attacks body, goods,  honor and life, brings upon us sickness, poverty, shame and death,  which God so permits and ordains. See, here begins the second work, or  the second rest of the Third Commandment; by this faith is very greatly  tried, even as gold in the fire. For it is a great thing to retain a  sure confidence in God, although He sends us death, shame, sickness,  poverty; and in this cruel form of wrath to regard Him as our  all-gracious Father, as must be done in this work of the Third  Commandment.  Here suffering contains faith, that it must call upon  God's Name and praise it in such suffering, and so it comes through the  Third Commandment into the Second again; and through that very calling  on the Name of God and praise, faith grows, and becomes conscious of  itself, and so strengthens itself, through the two works of the Third  and of the Second Commandment. Thus faith goes out into the works and  through the works comes to itself again; just as the sun goes forth  unto its setting and comes again unto its rising. For this reason the  Scriptures associate the day with peaceful living in works, the night  with passive living in adversity, and faith lives and works, goes out  and comes in, in both, as Christ says, John ix.    XXV. This order of good works we pray in the Lord's Prayer. The first  is this, that we say: \"Our Father, Who art in heaven\"; these are the  words of the first work of faith, which, according to the First  Commandment, does not doubt that it has a gracious Father in heaven.  The second: \"Hallowed be Thy Name,\" in which faith asks that God's  Name, praise and honor be glorified, and calls upon it in every need,  as the Second Commandment says. The third: \"Thy kingdom come,\" in which  we pray for the true Sabbath and rest, peaceful cessation of our works,  that God's work alone be done in us, and so God rule in us as in His  own kingdom, as He says, Luke xvii, \"Behold, God's kingdom is nowhere  else except within you.\" The fourth petition is \"Thy will be done\"; in  which we pray that we may keep and have the Seven Commandments of the  Second Table, in which faith is exercised toward our neighbor; just as  in the first three it is exercised in works toward God alone. And these  are the petitions in which stands the word \"Thou, Thy, Thy, Thy,\"  because they seek only what belongs to God; all the others say \"our,  us, our,\" etc; for in them we pray for our goods and blessedness.    Let this, then, suffice as a plain, hasty explanation of the First  Table of Moses, pointing out to simple folk what are the highest of  good works.    The Second Table follows.        \"Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother.\"    From this Commandment we learn that after the excellent works of the  first three Commandments there are no better works than to obey and  serve all those who are set over us as superiors. For this reason also  disobedience is a greater sin than murder, unchastity, theft and  dishonesty, and all that these may include.  For we can in no better  way learn how to distinguish between greater and lesser sins than by  noting the order of the Commandments of God, although there are  distinctions also within the works of each Commandment. For who does  not know that to curse is a greater sin than to be angry, to strike  than to curse, to strike father and mother more than to strike any one  else?  Thus these seven Commandments teach us how we are to exercise  ourselves in good works toward men, and first of all toward our  superiors.    The first work is that we honor our own father and mother. And this  honor consists not only in respectful demeanor, but in this: that we  obey them, look up to, esteem and heed their words and example, accept  what they say, keep silent and endure their treatment of us, so long as  it is not contrary to the first three Commandments; in addition, when  they need it, that we provide them with food, clothing and shelter. For  not for nothing has He said: \"Thou shalt honor them\"; He does not say:  \"Thou shalt love them,\" although this also must be done. But honor is  higher than mere love and includes a certain fear, which unites with  love, and causes a man to fear offending them more than he fears the  punishment. Just as there is fear in the honor we pay a sanctuary, and  yet we do not flee from it as from a punishment, but draw near to it  all the more. Such a fear mingled with love is the true honor; the  other fear without any love is that which we have toward things which  we despise or flee from, as we fear the hangman or punishment. There is  no honor in that, for it is a fear without all love, nay, fear that has  with it hatred and enmity. Of this we have a proverb of St. Jerome:  What we fear, that we also hate. With such a fear God does not wish to  be feared or honored, nor to have us honor our parents; but with the  first, which is mingled with love and confidence.    II. This work appears easy, but few regard it aright. For where the  parents are truly pious and love their children not according to the  flesh, but (as they ought) instruct and direct them by words and works  to serve God according to the first three Commandments, there the  child's own will is constantly broken, and it must do, leave undone,  and suffer what its nature would most gladly do otherwise; and thereby  it finds occasion to despise its parents, to murmur against them, or to  do worse things. There love and fear depart, unless they have God's  grace.  In like manner, when they punish and chastise, as they ought  (at times even unjustly, which, however, does not harm the soul's  salvation), our evil nature resents the correction. Beside all this,  there are some so wicked that they are ashamed of their parents because  of poverty, lowly birth, deformity or dishonor, and allow these things  to influence them more than the high Commandment of God, Who is above  all things, and has with benevolent intent given them such parents, to  exercise and try them in His Commandment. But the matter becomes still  worse when the child has children of its own; then love descends to  them, and detracts very much from the love and honor toward the parents.    But what is said and commanded of parents must also be understood of  those who, when the parents are dead or absent, take their place, such  as relatives, god-parents, sponsors, temporal lords and spiritual  fathers. For every one must be ruled and be subject to other men.  Wherefore we here see again how many good works are taught in this  Commandment, since in it all our life is made subject to other men.  Hence it comes that obedience is so highly praised and all virtue and  good works are included in it.    III. There is another dishonoring of parents, much more dangerous and  subtile than this first, which adorns itself and passes for a real  honor; that is, when a child has its own way, and the parents through  natural love allow it. Here there is indeed mutual honor, here there is  mutual love, and on all sides it is a precious thing, parents and child  take mutual pleasure in one another.    This plague is so common that instances of the first form of  dishonoring are very seldom seen. This is due to the fact that the  parents are blinded, and neither know nor honor God according to the  first three Commandments; hence also they cannot see what the children  lack, and how they ought to teach and train them.  For this reason they  train them for worldly honors, pleasure and possessions, that they may  by all means please men and reach high positions: this the children  like, and they obey very gladly without gainsaying.    Thus God's Commandment secretly comes to naught while all seems good,  and that is fulfilled which is written in the Prophets Isaiah and  Jeremiah, that the children are destroyed by their own parents, and  they do like the king Manasseh, who sacrificed his own son to the idol  Moloch and burned him, II. Kings xxi. What else is it but to sacrifice  one's own child to the idol and to burn it, when parents train their  children more in the way of the world than in the way of God? let them  go their way, and be burned up in worldly pleasure, love, enjoyment,  possessions and honor, but let God's love and honor and the desire of  eternal blessings be quenched in them?    O how perilous it is to be a father or a mother, where flesh and blood  are supreme! For, truly, the knowledge and fulfilment of the first  three and the last six Commandments depends altogether upon this  Commandment;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#16)"],[1,"said, \"for if they  are allowed to remain there, their happiness and their future lives  will be ruined.\"    The Wizard did not reply at once, for he was thinking this a good  opportunity to win Rango's consent to his taking some monkeys to the  Emerald City for Ozma's birthday cake.    \"It is a great thing you ask of me, O Rango the Gray Ape,\" said he,  \"for the bigger the giants are the more powerful their enchantment, and  the more difficult it will be to restore them to their natural forms.  However, I will think it over.\"    Then the Wizard went to another part of the clearing and sat on a log  and appeared to be in deep thought.    The Glass Cat had been greatly interested in the Gray Ape's story and  was curious to see what the giant soldiers looked like.  Hearing that  their heads extended above the tree-tops, the Glass Cat decided that if  it climbed the tall avocado tree that stood at the side of the  clearing, it might be able to see the giants' heads.  So, without  mentioning her errand, the crystal creature went to the tree and, by  sticking her sharp glass claws in the bark, easily climbed the tree to  its very top and, looking over the forest, saw the six giant heads,  although they were now a long way off.  It was, indeed, a remarkable  sight, for the huge heads had immense soldier caps on them, with red  and yellow plumes and looked very fierce and terrible, although the  monkey hearts of the giants were at that moment filled with fear.    Having satisfied her curiosity, the Glass Cat began to climb down from  the tree more slowly.  Suddenly she discerned the Wizard's black bag  hanging from a limb of the tree.  She grasped the black bag in her  glass teeth, and although it was rather heavy for so small an animal,  managed to get it free and to carry it safely down to the ground.  Then  she looked around for the Wizard and seeing him seated upon the stump  she hid the black bag among some leaves and then went over to where the  Wizard sat.    \"I forgot to tell you,\" said the Glass Cat, \"that Trot and Cap'n Bill  are in trouble, and I came here to hunt you up and get you to go and  rescue them.\"    \"Good gracious, Cat!  Why didn't you tell me before?\" exclaimed the  Wizard.    \"For the reason that I found so much excitement here that I forgot Trot  and Cap'n Bill.\"    \"What's wrong with them?\" asked the Wizard.    Then the Glass Cat explained how they had gone to get the Magic Flower  for Ozma's birthday gift and had been trapped by the magic of the queer  island.  The Wizard was really alarmed, but he shook his head and said  sadly:    \"I'm afraid I can't help my dear friends, because I've lost my black  bag.\"    \"If I find it, will you go to them?\" asked the creature.    \"Of course,\" replied the Wizard.  \"But I do not think that a Glass Cat  with nothing but pink brains can succeed when all the rest of us have  failed.\"    \"Don't you admire my pink brains?\" demanded the Cat.    \"They're pretty,\" admitted the Wizard, \"but they're not regular brains,  you know, and so we don't expect them to amount to much.\"    \"But if I find your black bag--and find it inside of five minutes--will  you admit my pink brains are better than your common human brains?\"    \"Well, I'll admit they're better HUNTERS,\" said the Wizard,  reluctantly, \"but you can't do it.  We've searched everywhere, and the  black bag isn't to be found.\"    \"That shows how much you know!\" retorted the Glass Cat, scornfully.  \"Watch my brains a minute, and see them whirl around.\"    The Wizard watched, for he was anxious to regain his black bag, and the  pink brains really did whirl around in a remarkable manner.    \"Now, come with me,\" commanded the Glass Cat, and led the Wizard  straight to the spot where it had covered the bag with leaves.  \"According to my brains,\" said the creature, \"your black bag ought to  be here.\"    Then it scratched at the leaves and uncovered the bag, which the Wizard  promptly seized with a cry of delight.  Now that he had regained his  Magic Tools, he felt confident he could rescue Trot and Cap'n Bill.    Rango the Gray Ape was getting impatient.  He now approached the Wizard  and said:    \"Well, what do you intend to do about those poor enchanted monkeys?\"    \"I'll make a bargain with you, Rango,\" replied the little man.  \"If you  will let me take a dozen of your monkeys to the Emerald City, and keep  them until after Ozma's birthday, I'll break the enchantment of the six  Giant Soldiers and return them to their natural forms.\"    But the Gray Ape shook his head.    \"I can't do it,\" he declared.  \"The monkeys would be very lonesome and  unhappy in the Emerald City and your people would tease them and throw  stones at them, which would cause them to fight and bite.\"    \"The people won't see them till Ozma's birthday dinner,\" promised the  Wizard.  \"I'll make them very small--about four inches high, and I'll  keep them in a pretty cage in my own room, where they will be safe from  harm.  I'll feed them the nicest kind of food, train them to do some  clever tricks, and on Ozma's birthday I'll hide the twelve little  monkeys inside a cake.  When Ozma cuts the cake the monkeys will jump  out on to the table and do their tricks.  The next day I will bring  them back to the forest and make them big as ever, and they'll have  some exciting stories to tell their friends.  What do you say, Rango?\"    \"I say no!\" answered the Gray Ape.  \"I won't have my monkeys enchanted  and made to do tricks for the Oz people.\"    \"Very well,\" said the Wizard calmly; \"then I'll go.  Come, Dorothy,\" he  called to the little girl, \"let's start on our journey.\"    \"Aren't you going to save those six monkeys who are giant soldiers?\"  asked Rango, anxiously.    \"Why should I?\" returned the Wizard.  \"If you will not do me the favor  I ask, you cannot expect me to favor you.\"    \"Wait a minute,\" said the Gray Ape.  \"I've changed my mind.  If you  will treat the twelve monkeys nicely and bring them safely back to the  forest, I'll let you take them.\"    \"Thank you,\" replied the Wizard, cheerfully.  \"We'll go at once and  save those giant soldiers.\"    So all the party left the clearing and proceeded to the place where the  giants still stood among the trees.  Hundreds of monkeys, apes, baboons  and orangoutangs had gathered round, and their wild chatter could be  heard a mile away.  But the Gray Ape soon hushed the babel of sounds,  and the Wizard lost no time in breaking the enchantments.  First one  and then another giant soldier disappeared and became an ordinary  monkey again, and the six were shortly returned to their friends in  their proper forms.    This action made the Wizard very popular with the great army of  monkeys, and when the Gray Ape announced that the Wizard wanted to  borrow twelve monkeys to take to the Emerald City for a couple of  weeks, and asked for volunteers, nearly a hundred offered to go, so  great was their confidence in the little man who had saved their  comrades.    The Wizard selected a dozen that  seemed intelligent and good-tempered,  and then he opened his black bag and took out a queerly shaped dish  that was silver on the outside and gold on the inside.  Into this dish  he poured a powder and set fire to it.  It made a thick smoke that  quite enveloped the twelve monkeys, as well as the form of the Wizard,  but when the smoke cleared away the dish had been changed to a golden  cage with silver bars, and the twelve monkeys had become about three  inches high and were all seated comfortably inside the cage.    The thousands of hairy animals who had witnessed this act of magic were  much astonished and applauded the Wizard by barking aloud and shaking  the limbs of the trees in which they sat.  Dorothy said: \"That was a  fine trick, Wizard!\" and the Gray Ape remarked: \"You are certainly the  most wonderful magician in all the Land of Oz!\"    \"Oh, no,\" modestly replied the little man.  \"Glinda's magic is better  than mine, but mine seems good enough to use on ordinary occasions.  And now, Rango, we will say good-bye, and I promise to return your  monkeys as happy and safe as they are now.\"    The Wizard rode on the back of the Hungry Tiger and carried the cage of  monkeys very carefully, so as not to joggle them.  Dorothy rode on the  back of the Cowardly Lion, and the Glass Cat trotted, as before, to  show them the way.    Gugu the King crouched upon a log and watched them go, but as he bade  them farewell, the enormous Leopard said:    \"I know now that you are the friends of beasts and that the forest  people may trust you.  Whenever the Wizard of Oz and Princess Dorothy  enter the Forest of Gugu hereafter, they will be as welcome and as safe  with us as ever they are in the Emerald City.\"          17.  A Remarkable Journey      \"You see,\" explained the Glass Cat, \"that Magic Isle where Trot and  Cap'n Bill are stuck is also in this Gillikin Country--over at the east  side of it, and it's no farther to go across-lots from here than it is  from here to the Emerald City.  So we'll save time by cutting across  the mountains.\"    \"Are you sure you know the way?\" asked Dorothy.    \"I know all the Land of Oz better than any other living creature knows  it,\" asserted the Glass Cat.    \"Go ahead, then, and guide us,\" said the Wizard.  \"We've left our poor  friends helpless too long already, and the sooner we rescue them the  happier they'll be.\"    \"Are you sure you can get 'em out of their fix?\" the little girl  inquired.    \"I've no doubt of it,\" the Wizard assured her.  \"But I can't tell what  sort of magic I must use until I get to the place and discover just how  they are enchanted.\"    \"I've heard of that Magic Isle where the Wonderful Flower grows,\"  remarked the Cowardly Lion.  \"Long ago, when I used to live in the  forests, the beasts told stories about the Isle and how the Magic  Flower was placed there to entrap strangers--men or beasts.\"    \"Is the Flower really wonderful?\" questioned Dorothy.
