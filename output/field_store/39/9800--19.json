After that  is done, pipe them, which is done in this manner: Dampen the hair, comb  each curl out straight, and wind it tightly on a rattan stick about four  inches long, having each curl on a separate stick, and commencing to  wind at the tip end, tying them firmly to keep in place. Then boil in  water for thirty minutes, and place in an oven as hot as they will bear  without burning, until quite dry. When dry and perfectly cool, take them  off the sticks, and smooth over a curling iron, the size you wish the  curls. Side curls and frizzes should be prepared the same way.    Cut No. 2 represents a set of Curls and Puffs. For explanation of Puffs,  see page 245.          WEAVING HAIR FOR WIGS.      [Illustration]    In commencing to weave, place the hair between two cards, or stiff  brushes, as shown in diagram, pressing them tight together, so that in  drawing out, it is perfectly free from tangles; draw out with the right  hand, between the thumb and fore-finger, the quantity of hair required  for the size of the weft; then change it into the left hand, and lift it  up to the No. 1 cord, as shown in diagram; lay the strand over No. 1,  under No. 2, over No. 3, around under No. 3, over Nos. 2 and 1, around  under Nos. 1 and 2, over No. 3, around under No. 3, over Nos. 2 and 1,  around under Nos. 1 and 2, over No. 3 around under Nos. 3 and 2, and  over No. 1. Then push the strands together, as shown in diagram. For  this weft use sewing silk.      WEAVING HAIR FOR WATERFALLS AND BOWS    Prepare the same as above, and place the strand under No. 1, over Nos. 2  and 3, around under Nos. 3 and 2, over No. 1, around under Nos. 1 and 2,  over No. 3, around under No. 3, and over Nos. 2 and 1. Aside from these  changes, follow directions given above.          MAKING WATERFALLS AND BOWS.      [Illustration: No. 1.]    [Illustration: No. 2.]    [Illustration: No. 3.]    In making a Chignon, you have first to make the cushion. Take the  combings or waste hair, which is of no other use, and place it between  the cards or stiff brushes, the same as for weaving. Use the weaving  apparatus, with two piping cords, instead of three small ones, and wind  the hair all up, by passing over, between and under the cords. Boil and  dry it, and then pull out the cord, which leaves it all crimped, ready  to weave, according to directions on page 239. Then sew it on a cord,  the same as a switch, and form it in any shape you desire, for a  Waterfall, Bow or Puffs. This completes the cushion. Then weave the long  hair for the covering, according to directions on page 243, and sew it  to the top end of the cushion; comb it out smooth, cover the cushion,  and tie a cord around it immediately at the bottom; then bring up the  end of the hair, and pin it to the inside. Cut No. 1 is intended to  represent the cushion, and No. 2 the complete Waterfall.    Cut No. 3 represents the Bow, which is made in the same manner, by using  two small cushions, like cut No. 1, and placing between them a strand of  smooth or braided hair.          MAKING PUFFS AND COILS.      [Illustration: No. 1.]    [Illustration: No. 2.]    [Illustration: No. 3.]    To make Puffs for front of head, from false hair, similar to cut No. 1,  weave hair from eight to twelve inches long, according to directions on  page 241; then take a ribbon, about one and a half inches wide, any  length required, and tack it on a wig block, or straight piece of board,  and sew the weft crossways a quarter of an inch apart, till the ribbon  is entirely covered; then divide it off in as many puffs as desired,  comb each out straight, and wind it over the two fore-fingers, close up  to ribbon, and put in a hair-pin to retain it.    To make Puffs for back of head, cut No. 2, prepare the same way; make  the foundation the shape and size you wish the puffs, and sew it on the  same way you want the puffs to run. The puffs may be made over a  cushion, formed of crimped hair the shape wanted, and wound over that  instead of the fingers. Ladies not wearing false hair, can have her own  hair dressed by following the above directions.    Cut No. 3 represents a coil, which is made from a switch, and wound over  a long roll of crimped hair. They are much nicer, but more expensive, by  being made altogether from a switch, as that can be twisted into a rope  or braided, before coiling.          EXPLANATIONS ON HAIR DRESSING.      I herewith present, on the following pages, a number of engravings  illustrative of a few of the many styles of Hair Dressing, accompanied  with explanatory remarks as to their execution. They are the latest and  most fashionable European and American styles, and will prove  indispensable to every lady's toilet, as, from the explanations, they  will be able, with very little practice, to dress their own hair in any  desired style; and when any new style is inaugurated, after studying and  practicing the directions given with each illustration, she will find it  an easy matter to arrange it accordingly.    Any one learning Hair Dressing, should acquire perfectly the execution  of the first pattern--the Promenade Head-Dress--as that is very easily  arranged, and when you have once executed it in a perfect manner, the  others will prove comparatively easy.    The manner of dressing the hair at the present day calls for much  attention, and many inquiries are addressed us on the subject. It is  plain, however, that what would correspond with the complexion and  physiognomy of one, would certainly have a distasteful appearance on  another; consequently, in answering inquiries, I can do nothing more  than give the different styles worn. Before giving my illustrations on  Hair Dressing, I have given instructions how to weave hair for chignons,  curls, switches, &c., and how to put them in shape, and with the  directions given with each illustration on Hair Dressing, it will  certainly be an easy task to arrange the hair in any style that is now  or may be in fashion.    [Illustration: PROMENADE HEAD-DRESS.]    Our first cut represents the Promenade Head-Dress, but is worn as  frequently in the drawing-room, and even at public and private  assemblies--in fact, a common and very pretty style.    EXPLANATION: Comb the front hair between the temples straight back, over  a cushion of crimped hair, forming a Chignon; then make two braids of  two small switches, and place one of them over the top of the Chignon,  and the other across the forehead, forming a diadem, turning the ends  under; then comb the hair from temples over the braids, and put back  under the Chignon, and fasten. Place a net of pearl or gilt beads over  the Chignon, as in cut. You can use false hair for covering cushion, if  desired.    [Illustration: RECEPTION HEAD-DRESS.]    This Head-Dress is a most charming composition, and entirely new. It is  adapted either for a brown or fair complexion, to be worn at grand  dinners or receptions. Ornamented with pearl or gilt, it is in good  taste for evening parties.    EXPLANATION: Curl the hair across forehead, or use false curls, combing  the hair straight back, and form a chignon of curls at the back. Place a  diadem plait across forehead, and raise the hair from the temples over  the plait. Trim with roses and ribbans, or to suit dress.    [Illustration: SOIREE OR EVENING HEAD-DRESS.]    This cut illustrates the Soiree or Evening Head-Dress. It is a very  unique and modern style, suited for almost any complexion, and very  easily executed.    EXPLANATION: Comb the hair straight back between the temples, tie it,  and curl the ends, or use a set of long false curls. Place a diadem  plait, made from a switch, across the forehead; then comb the hair back  from the temples, over the ends of the plait, twist it, pass it back  under the curls, and fasten firmly. Use a fancy back-comb on top of  curls, and pin an ornament to diadem plait, with feather and chain  attached, as in cut, or trim to suit dress.      [Illustration: GRAND EVENING PARTY HEAD-DRESS.]    A very graceful Head-Dress, of a bold style, suited for a young lady of  brown or fair complexion, and is in good taste to be worn at the theatre  or Grand Evening Parties.    EXPLANATION: Make a parting over the head, from ear to ear, two inches  from front; on the forehead, between the temples, curl the hair in small  friz curls, and from the temple to the ear, make loose puffs. Divide the  hair in three partings over the head, and roll each in a large puff;  then form a large puff of the back hair, round the nape of the neck, as  in cut. Fasten a large set of loose curls over the puff, with a comb or  other ornament. For reference, see page 245.    [Illustration: EMPRESS HEAD-DRESS.]    A charming Head-Dress, and entirely new, perfectly suiting a fair  complexion. It may serve for the theatre or evening parties. When  powdered it preferably suits a brown or brunette.    EXPLANATION: Make a front parting, and a cross one from ear to ear.  Divide each side into five parts; of the front parting make three puffs  on each side. The remaining four make into long puffs, as in cut,  according to explanations on page 245. The back hair may be arranged in  the same style of puffs, or with a double Chignon, placing a single,  long false curl or braid, back of each ear. Trim with orange leaves, or  to suit dress.      [Illustration: PARISIAN HEAD-DRESS.]    This Head-Dress, both bold and graceful, is suitable for any complexion  or age, when the physiognomy allows it.    EXPLANATION: Comb back the hair from the forehead between the temples,  make a large puff on the temples, and three puffs above each ear. Place  a cushion at the back of head, and comb the hair over it, forming a  chignon; then place a diadem plait, or twist, made from a large switch,  round on the top of head, trimmed with leaves or ribbon, as shown in  cut.
