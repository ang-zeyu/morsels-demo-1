CLASSES OF ADJECTIVES.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--When I say _large, round, sweet, yellow  oranges_, the words _large, round, sweet_, and _yellow_ modify the word  _oranges_ by telling the _kind_, and limit the application of the word to  oranges of that kind.    When I say _this orange, yonder orange, one orange_, the words _this,  yonder_, and _one_ do not tell the kind, but simply point out or number the  orange, and limit the application of the word to the orange pointed out or  numbered.    Adjectives of the first class describe by giving a quality, and so are  called +Descriptive adjectives+.    Adjectives of the second class define by pointing out or numbering, and so  are called +Definitive adjectives+.    Let the teacher write nouns on the board, and require the pupils to modify  them by appropriate descriptive and definitive adjectives.    DEFINITIONS.    +A _Descriptive Adjective_ is one that modifies by expressing quality+.    +A _Definitive Adjective_ is one that modifies by pointing out, numbering,  or denoting quantity+.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    Place the following adjectives in two columns, one headed _descriptive_,  and the other _definitive_, then build simple sentences in which they shall  be employed as _modifiers_. Find out the meaning of each word before you  use it.      Round, frolicsome, first, industrious, jolly, idle, skillful, each, the,    faithful, an, kind, one, tall, ancient, modern, dancing, mischievous,    stationary, nimble, several, slanting, parallel, oval, every.    Build simple sentences in which the following _descriptive_ adjectives  shall be employed as _attribute complements_. Let some of these attributes  be _compound_.      Restless, impulsive, dense, rare, gritty, sluggish, dingy, selfish,    clear, cold, sparkling, slender, graceful, hungry, friendless.    Build simple sentences in which the following _descriptive_ adjectives  shall be employed.    Some of these adjectives have the _form_ of _participles_, and some are  _derived_ from _proper nouns_.    +CAPITAL LETTER--RULE.--An Adjective derived from a proper noun must begin  with a capital letter+.      Shining, moving, swaying, bubbling, American, German, French, Swiss,    Irish, Chinese.          LESSON 74.    CLASSES OF VERBS.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--_The man caught_ makes no complete  assertion, and is not a sentence. If I add the object complement _fish_, I  complete the assertion and form a sentence--_The man caught fish_. The  action expressed by _caught_ passes over from the man to the fish.  _Transitive_ means _passing over_, and so all those verbs that express an  action that passes over from a doer to something which receives, are called  +Transitive verbs+.    _Fish swim_. The verb _swim_ does not require an object to complete the  sentence. No action passes from a doer to a receiver. These verbs which  express action that does not pass over to a receiver, and all those which  do not express action at all, but simply _being_ or _state of being_, are  called +Intransitive verbs+.    Let the teacher write transitive and intransitive verbs on the board, and  require the pupils to distinguish them.    When I say, I _crush_ the worm, I express an action that is going on now,  or in present time. I _crushed_ the worm, expresses an action that took  place in past time. As _tense_ means _time_, we call the form _crush_ the  _present tense_ of the verb, and _crushed_ the _past tense_. In the  sentence, The worm _crushed_ under my foot died, _crushed_, expressing the  action as assumed, is, as you have already learned, a participle; and, as  the action is completed, we call it a _past participle_. Now notice that  _ed_ was added to _crush_, the verb in the present tense, to form the verb  in the past tense, and to form the past participle. Most verbs form their  past tense and their past participle by adding _ed_, and so we call such  +Regular verbs+.    I _see_ the man; I _saw_ the man; The man _seen_ by me ran away. I _catch_  fish in the brook; I _caught_ fish in the brook; The fish _caught_ in the  brook tasted good. Here the verbs _see_ and _catch_ do not form their past  tense and past participle by adding _ed_ to the present, and so we call  them _Irregular verbs_.    Let the teacher write on the board verbs of both classes, and require the  pupils to distinguish them.      DEFINITIONS.    CLASSES OF VERBS WITH RESPECT TO MEANING.    +A _Transitive Verb_ is one that requires an object+. [Footnote: The  _object_ of a transitive verb, that is, the name of the receiver of the  action, may be the _object complement_, or it may be the subject; as,  Brutus stabbed _Caesar_, _Caesar_ was stabbed by Brutus.]    +An _Intransitive Verb_ is one that does not require an object+.    CLASSES OF VERBS WITH RESPECT TO FORM.    +A _Regular Verb_ is one that forms its past tense and past participle by  adding _ed_ to the present+. [Footnote: If the present ends in _e_, the _e_  is dropped when _ed_ is added; as, lov_e_, lov_ed_; believ_e_, believ_ed_.]    +An _Irregular Verb_ is one that does not form its past tense and past  participle by adding _ed_ to the present+.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    Place the following verbs in two columns, one headed _transitive_ and the  other, _intransitive_. Place the same verbs in two other columns, one  headed _regular_ and the other, _irregular_. Build these verbs into  sentences by supplying a subject to each intransitive verb, and a subject  and an object to each transitive verb.      Vanish, gallop, bite, promote, contain, produce, provide, veto, secure,    scramble, rattle, draw.    Arrange the following verbs as before, and then build them into sentences  by supplying a subject and a noun attribute to each intransitive verb, and  a subject and an object to each transitive verb.      Degrade, gather, know, was, became, is.    A verb may be transitive in one sentence and intransitive in another. Use  the following verbs both ways.    +Model+.--The wren _sings_ sweetly.    The wren _sings_ a pretty little song.      Bend, ring, break, dash, move.          LESSON 75.    CLASSES OF ADVERBS.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--When I say, He will come _soon_, or  _presently_, or _often_, or _early_, I am using, to modify _will come_,  words which express the _time_ of coming. These and all such adverbs we  call +Adverbs of Time+.    He will come _up_, or _hither_, or _here_, or _back_. Here I use, to modify  _will come_, words which express _place_. These and all such adverbs we  call +Adverbs of Place+.    When I say, The weather is _so_ cold, or _very_ cold, or _intensely_ cold,  the words _so, very_, and _intensely_ modify the adjective _cold_ by  expressing the _degree_ of coldness. These and all such adverbs we call  +Adverbs of Degree+.    When I say, He spoke _freely, wisely_, and _well_, the words _freely,  wisely_, and _well_ tell how or _in what manner_ he spoke. All such adverbs  we call +Adverbs of Manner+.    Let the teacher place adverbs on the board, and require the pupil to  classify them.      DEFINITIONS.    +_Adverbs of Time_ are those that generally answer the question+, _When?_    _+Adverbs of Place are those that generally answer the question+, Where?    +Adverbs of Degree are those that generally answer the question+, To what  extent?    +Adverbs of Manner are those that generally answer the question+, In what  way?_    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    Place the following adverbs in the four classes we have made--if the  classification be perfect, there will be five words in each column--then  build each adverb into a simple sentence.      Partly, only, too, wisely, now, here, when, very, well, where, nobly,    already, seldom, more, ably, away, always, not, there, out.    Some adverbs, as you have already learned, modify two verbs, and thus  connect the two clauses in which these verbs occur. Such adverbs are called  _+Conjunctive Adverbs+_.    The following _dependent_ clauses are introduced by _conjunctive adverbs_.  Build them into complex sentences by supplying _independent clauses_.    ------ _when_ the ice is smooth;  ------ _while_ we sleep;  ------ _before_ winter comes;  ------ _where_ the reindeer lives;  ------ _wherever_ you go.          LESSON 76.    CLASSES OF CONJUNCTIONS. [Footnote: For classified lists, see pp. 190,191.]    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--_Frogs, antelopes, and kangaroos can jump_.  Here the three nouns are of the same rank in the sentence. All are subjects  of _can jump. War has ceased, and peace has come_. In this compound  sentence, there are two clauses of the same rank. The word _and_ connects  the subjects of _can jump_, in the first sentence: and the two clauses, in  the second. All words that connect words, phrases, or clauses of the _same  rank_ are called +Co-ordinate Conjunctions+.    _If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. I will go, because you need  me_. Here _if_ joins the clause, _you have tears_, as a modifier,  expressing condition, to the independent clause, _prepare to shed them  now;_ and _because_ connects _you need me_, as a modifier, expressing  reason or cause, to the independent clause, _I will go_. These and all such  conjunctions as connect dependent clauses to clauses of a _higher rank_ are  called +Subordinate Conjunctions+.    Let the teacher illustrate the meaning and use of the words _subordinate_  and _co-ordinate_.      DEFINITIONS.    +_Co-ordinate Conjunctions_ are such as connect words, phrases, or clauses  of the same rank+.    +_Subordinate Conjunctions_ are such as connect clauses of different rank+.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    Build four short sentences for each of the three _co-ordinate conjunctions_  that follow. In the first, let the conjunction be used to connect principal  parts of a sentence; in the second, to connect word modifiers; in the  third, to connect phrase modifiers; and in the fourth, to connect"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7014"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#16)"],[1," common chocolate, one  quarter of the cacao of Caracas, with three-quarters of that of  Guayaquil, the latter has been employed pure in Spain. We must here  remark, that a great deal of cacao of an inferior quality, such as  that of Maranon, the Rio Negro, Honduras, and the island of St. Lucia,  bears the name, in commerce, of Guayaquil cacao. The exportation from  that port amounts only to sixty thousand fanegas; consequently it is  two-thirds less than that of the ports of the Capitania-General of  Caracas.    Though the plantations of cacao have augmented in the provinces of  Cumana, Barcelona, and Maracaybo, in proportion as they have  diminished in the province of Caracas, it is still believed that, in  general, this ancient branch of agricultural industry gradually  declines. In many parts coffee and cotton-trees progressively take  place of the cacao, of which the lingering harvests weary the patience  of the cultivator. It is also asserted, that the new plantations of  cacao are less productive than the old; the trees do not acquire the  same vigour, and yield later and less abundant fruit. The soil is  still said to be exhausted; but probably it is rather the atmosphere  that is changed by the progress of clearing and cultivation. The air  that reposes on a virgin soil covered with forests is loaded with  humidity and those gaseous mixtures that serve for the nutriment of  plants, and arise from the decomposition of organic substances. When a  country has been long subjected to cultivation, it is not the  proportions between the azote and oxygen that vary. The constituent  bases of the atmosphere remain unaltered; but it no longer contains,  in a state of suspension, those binary and ternary mixtures of carbon,  hydrogen, and nitrogen, which a virgin soil exhales, and which are  regarded as a source of fecundity. The air, purer and less charged  with miasmata and heterogeneous emanations, becomes at the same time  drier. The elasticity of the vapours undergoes a sensible diminution.  On land long cleared, and consequently little favourable to the  cultivation of the cacao-tree (as, for instance, in the West India  Islands), the fruit is almost as small as that of the wild cacao-tree.  It is on the banks of the Upper Orinoco, after having crossed the  Llanos, that we find the true country of the cacao-tree; thick  forests, in which, on a virgin soil, and surrounded by an atmosphere  continually humid, the trees furnish, from the fourth year, abundant  crops. Wherever the soil is not exhausted, the fruit has become by  cultivation larger and bitter, but also later.    On seeing the produce of cacao gradually diminish in Terra Firma, it  may be inquired, whether the consumption will diminish in the same  proportion in Spain, Italy, and the rest of Europe; or whether it be  not probable, that by the destruction of the cacao plantations, the  price will augment sufficiently to rouse anew the industry of the  cultivator. This latter opinion is generally admitted by those who  deplore, at Caracas, the diminution of so ancient and profitable a  branch of commerce. In proportion as civilization extends towards the  humid forests of the interior, the banks of the Orinoco and the  Amazon, or towards the valleys that furrow the eastern declivity of  the Andes, the new planters will find lands and an atmosphere equally  favourable to the culture of the cacao-tree.    The Spaniards, in general, dislike a mixture of vanilla with the  cacao, as irritating the nervous system; the fruit, therefore, of that  orchideous plant is entirely neglected in the province of Caracas,  though abundant crops of it might be gathered on the moist and  feverish coast between Porto Cabello and Ocumare; especially at  Turiamo, where the fruits of the Epidendrum vanilla attain the length  of eleven or twelve inches. The English and the Anglo-Americans often  seek to make purchases of vanilla at the port of La Guayra, but the  merchants procure with difficulty a very small quantity. In the  valleys that descend from the chain of the coast towards the Caribbean  Sea, in the province of Truxillo, as well as in the Missions of  Guiana, near the cataracts of the Orinoco, a great quantity of vanilla  might be collected; the produce of which would be still more abundant,  if, according to the practice of the Mexicans, the plant were  disengaged, from time to time, from the creeping plants by which it is  entwined and stifled.    The hot and fertile valleys of the Cordillera of the coast of  Venezuela occupy a tract of land which, on the west, towards the lake  of Maracaybo, displays a remarkable variety of scenery. I shall  exhibit in one view, to close this chapter, the facts I have been able  to collect respecting the quality of the soil and the metallic riches  of the districts of Aroa, of Barquesimeto, and of Carora.    From the Sierra Nevada of Merida, and the paramos of Niquitao, Bocono,  and Las Rosas,* (Many travellers, who were monks, have asserted that  the little Paramo de Las Rosas, the height of which appears to be more  than 1,600 toises, is covered with rosemary, and the red and white  roses of Europe grow wild there. These roses are gathered to decorate  the altars in the neighbouring villages on the festivals of the  church. By what accident has our Rosa centifolia become wild in this  country, while we nowhere found it in the Andes of Quito and Peru? Can  it really be the rose-tree of our garden?) which contain the valuable  bark-tree, the eastern Cordillera of New Granada* (* The bark exported  from the port of Maracaybo does not come from the territory of  Venezuela, but from the mountains of Pamplona in New Grenada, being  brought down the Rio de San Faustino, that flows into the lake of  Maracaybo. (Pombo, Noticias sobre las Quinas, 1814 page 65.) Some is  collected near Merida, in the ravine of Viscucucuy.) decreases in  height so rapidly, that, between the ninth and tenth degrees of  latitude, it forms only a chain of little mountains, which, stretching  to the north-east by the Altar and Torito, separates the rivers that  join the Apure and the Orinoco from those numerous rivers that flow  either into the Caribbean Sea or the lake of Maracaybo. On this  dividing ridge are built the towns of Nirgua, San Felipe el Fuerte,  Barquesimeto, and Tocuyo. The first three are in a very hot climate;  but Tocuyo enjoys great coolness, and we heard with surprise, that,  beneath so fine a sky, the inhabitants have a strong propensity to  suicide. The ground rises towards the south; for Truxillo, the lake of  Urao, from which carbonate of soda is extracted, and La Grita, all to  the east of the Cordillera, though no farther distant, are four or  five hundred toises high.    On examining the law which the primitive strata of the Cordillera of  the coast follow in their dip, we believe we recognize one of the  causes of the extreme humidity of the land bounded by this Cordillera  and the ocean. The dip of the strata is most frequently to the  north-west; so that the waters flow in that direction on the ledges of  rock; and form, as we have stated above, that multitude of torrents  and rivers, the inundations of which become so fatal to the health of  the inhabitants, from cape Codera as far as the lake of Maracaybo.    Among the rivers which descend north-east toward the coast of Porto  Cabello, and La Punta de Hicacos, the most remarkable are those of  Tocuyo, Aroa, and Yaracuy. Were it not for the miasmata which infect  the atmosphere, the valleys of Aroa and of Yaracuy would perhaps be  more populous than those of Aragua. Navigable rivers would even give  the former the advantage of facilitating the exportation of their own  crops of sugar and cacao, and that of the productions of the  neighbouring lands; as the wheat of Quibor, the cattle of Monai, and  the copper of Aroa. The mines from which this copper is extracted, are  in a lateral valley, opening into that of Aroa; and which is less hot,  and less unhealthy, than the ravines nearer the sea. In the latter the  Indians have their gold-washings, and the soil conceals rich  copper-ores, which no one has yet attempted to extract. The ancient  mines of Aroa, after having been long neglected, have been wrought  anew by the care of Don Antonio Henriquez, whom we met at San Fernando  on the borders of the Apure. The total produce of metallic copper is  twelve or fifteen hundred quintals a year. This copper, known at Cadiz  by the name of Caracas copper, is of excellent quality. It is even  preferred to that of Sweden, and of Coquimbo in Chile. Part of the  copper of Aroa is employed for making bells, which are cast on the  spot. Some ores of silver have been recently discovered between Aroa  and Nirgua, near Guanita, in the mountain of San Pablo. Grains of gold  are found in all the mountainous lands between the Rio Yaracuy, the  town of San Felipe, Nirgua, and Barquesimeto; particularly in the Rio  de Santa Cruz, in which the Indian gold-gatherers have sometimes found  lumps of the value of four or five piastres. Do the neighbouring rocks  of mica-slate and gneiss contain veins? or is the gold disseminated  here, as in the granites of Guadarama in Spain, and of the Fichtelberg  in Franconia, throughout the whole mass of the rock? Possibly the  waters, in filtering through it, bring together the disseminated  grains of gold; in which case every attempt to work the rock would be  useless. In the Savana de la Miel, near the town of Barquesimeto, a  shaft has been sunk in a black shining slate resembling ampelite. The  minerals extracted from this shaft, which were sent to me at Caracas,  were quartz, non-auriferous pyrites, and carbonated lead, crystallized  in needles of a silky lustre.    In the early times of the conquest the working of the mines of Nirgua  and of Buria* was begun, notwithstanding the incursions of the warlike  nation of the Giraharas. (* The valley of Buria, and"]]]
