[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36962"],[0,"My Attainment of the Pole (#16)"],[1,"it was going, of the continents to the south of me,  of the cities with their teeming millions, and of the men with their  multitudinous, conflicting ambitions. I could see, in my mind, the  gigantic globe of my world swinging in cloud-swept emerald spaces, and  far in the remote, vast, white regions in the north of it, far from the  haunts of men, thousands of miles from its populous cities, beyond the  raging of its blue-green seas, myself, alone, a wee, small atom on its  vast surface, striving to reach its hitherto unattained goal. I felt, as  I thought of my anticipation and lonely quest, a sense of the terrible  overwhelming hugeness of the earth, and the poignant loneliness any soul  must feel when it embarks upon some splendid solitary destiny.    Beyond and above me I visioned the unimaginable, blinding white regions  of ice and cold, about which, like a golden-crowned sentinel, with face  of flame, the circling midnight sun kept guard. Upon this desolate,  awe-inspiring stage--unchanged since the days of its designing--I saw  myself attempting to win in the most spectacular and difficult marathon  for the testing of human strength, courage and perseverance, of body and  brain, which God has offered to man. I could see myself, in my fancy  pictures, invading those roaring regions, struggling over icy lands in  the dismal twilight of the Arctic morning, and venturing, with a few  companions, upon the lifeless, wind-swept Polar sea. A black mite, I saw  myself slowly piercing those white and terrible spaces, braving terrific  storms, assailing green, adamantine barriers of ice, crossing the  swift-flowing, black rivers of those ice fields, and stoutly persisting  until, successful, I stood alone, a victor, upon the world's pinnacle!    This thought gave me wild joy. That I, one white man, might alone  succeed in this quest gave me an impetus which only single-handed effort  and the prospect of single-handed success can give. There was pleasure  in the thought that, in this effort, I was indebted to no one; no one  had expended money for me or my trip; no white men were to risk their  lives with me. Whether it resulted in success or defeat, I alone should  exult or I alone should suffer. I was the mascot of no clique of  friends, nor the pawn of scientists who might find a suppositious and  mythical glory in the reflected light of another's achievement. The  quest was personal; the pleasure of success must be personal.    Yet, I want you to understand this thing was no casual jaunt with me.  All my life hinged about it, my hopes were bent upon it; the doing of it  was part of me. My plans of action were not haphazard and hair-brained.  Logically and clearly, I mapped out a campaign. It was based upon  experience in known conditions, experience gathered after years of  discouragement and failure.    At Annoatok we erected a house of packing boxes.[6] The building of the  house, which was to be both storehouse and workshop, was a simple  matter. The walls were made of the packing boxes, especially selected of  uniform size for this purpose.    [Illustration: ON THE CHASE FOR BEAR    THE BOX-HOUSE AT ANNOATOK AND ITS WINTER ENVIRONMENT]    [Illustration: MAN'S PREY OF THE ARCTIC SEA--WALRUS ASLEEP]    Enclosing a space thirteen by sixteen feet, the cases were quickly piled  up. The walls were held together by strips of wood, the joints sealed  with pasted paper, with the addition of a few long boards. A really good  roof was made by using the covers of the boxes as shingles. A blanket of  turf over this confined the heat and permitted, at the same time,  healthful circulation of air.    We slept under our own roof at the end of the first day. Our new house  had the great advantage of containing within it all our possessions  within easy reach at all times. When anything was needed in the way of  supplies, all we had to do was to open a box in the wall.    The house completed, we immediately began the work of building sledges,  and the equally important work, at which a large proportion of the  Eskimos were at once set, of making up furs into clothing. According to  my plans, each one of us embarking in the Polar journey would have to  carry two suits of fur clothing. In the Arctic regions, especially when  men are marching to the limit of their strength every day, the bodily  heat puts the clothing into such condition that the only safe way, if  health is to be preserved, is to change suits frequently, while the  perspiration-soaked furs are laid out to dry.    The Eskimos had also to prepare for winter. Tents of sealskin are  inhabitable only in the summer time. For the coming period of darkness  and bitter cold, they made igloos of stone and snow.    Meanwhile, they were not in the least averse to agreeable relaxation. I  had with me a good supply of tea, and was in the habit of drinking a cup  of it with Francke about four o'clock every afternoon. Observing this,  the Eskimos at once began to present themselves at the tea hour.  Fortunately, tea was one of the supplies of which I had brought a good  deal for the sake of pleasing the natives, and it was not long before I  had a very large and gossipy afternoon tea party every day, in this  northernmost human settlement of the globe.    I planned to superintend every detail of progress, as far as it  concerned our journey. I could watch the men, too, and see which ones  promised to be the best to accompany me. And, what was a most important  point, I could also perfect my final plans for the advance right at my  final base.    I aimed to reach the top of the globe in the angle between Alaska and  Greenland, a promising route through a new and lonesome region which had  not been tried, abandoning what has come to be called the \"American  Route.\" I should strike westward and then northward, working new trails.  With Annoatok as a base of operations, I planned to carry sufficient  supplies over Schley Land and along the west coast of the game lands,  trusting that the game along this region would furnish sufficient  supplies en route to the shores of the Polar sea. This journey to land's  end would also afford a test of every article of equipment needed in the  field work, and would enable us to choose finally from a selected  number of Eskimos those most able to endure the rigors of the unlimited  journey which lay before us.    I sent out a few hunters along the intended line to seek for haunts of  game, but I was not surprised that their searching in the dark was  practically unsuccessful, and it merely meant that I must depend upon my  previous knowledge of conditions. I knew from the general reports of the  natives, and from the explorations of Sverdrup, that the beginning of  the intended route offered abundant game, and the indications were that  further food would likewise be found as we advanced. The readiness with  which the Eskimos declared themselves ready to trust to the food supply  of the unknown region was highly encouraging.    To start from my base with men and dogs in superb condition, with their  bodies nourished with wholesome fresh meat instead of the nauseating  laboratory stuff too often given to men in the North, was of vital  importance; and if the men and dogs could afterwards be supported in  great measure by the game of the region through which we were to pass,  it would be of an importance more vital still. If my information was  well founded and my general conjectures correct, I should have  advantages which had not been possessed by any other leader of a Polar  expedition. The new route seemed to promise, also, immunity from the  highly disturbing effects of certain North Greenland currents. In all,  the chances seemed not unfavorable.    With busy people hard at work about me, I knew that the months of the  long night would pass rapidly by. There was much to do, and with the  earliest dawn of the morning of the next year we must be ready to start  for the Pole.          THE CURTAIN OF NIGHT DROPS    TRIBE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY NATIVES BUSILY BEGIN PREPARATIONS FOR THE  POLAR DASH--EXCITING HUNTS FOR THE UNICORN AND OTHER GAME FROM ANNOATOK  TO CAPE YORK--EVERY ANIMAL CAUGHT BEARING UPON THE SUCCESS OF THE  VENTURE--THE GREY-GREEN GLOOM OF TWILIGHT IN WHICH THE ESKIMO WOMEN  COMMUNICATE WITH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD    VI    THE SUNSET OF 1907      Winter, long-lasting, dark and dismal, approached. To me it was to be a  season of feverish labor in which every hand at work and every hour  employed counted in the problem of success. While the hands of the  entire tribe would be busy, and while I should direct and help in the  making of sleds, catching of game, preparing of meat, I knew that my  mind would find continual excitement in dreams of my quest, in  anticipating and solving its difficulties, in feeling the bounding pulse  of the dash over the ice of the Polar sea, with dogs joyously barking,  whips cracking the air, and the reappearing sun paving our pathway with  liquid gold. In the labor of the long winter which I began to map out I  knew I should find ceaseless zest, for the pursuit of every narwhal,  every walrus, every fox I should regard with abated suspense, each one  bearing upon my chances; in the employment of every pair of hands I  should hang with an eager interest, the expediency and excellence of the  work making for success or failure. From this time onward everything of  my life, every native, every occurrence began to have some bearing upon  the dominating task to which I had set myself.    With the advance of winter, storms of frightful ferocity began to arise.  Inasmuch as we had stored meat and blubber in large quantities about our  camp, it was not necessary at these times to venture out to dig up  supplies from great depths of snow drift. During these periods hands  were employed busily inside the igloos. Although a large quantity of  animals and furs had been gathered by the hunters before our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36974"],[0,"Old Trails on the Niagara Frontier (#16)"],[1,"duties upon its commandant. His letters contain many allusions to the  \"incredible plague and trouble caused by merchants' goods frequently  sent without a single person to care for them.\" \"Last year,\" so he wrote  in May, '78, \"every place in this fort was lumbered with them, and  vessels were obliged to navigate the lakes until Nov. 30th.\" The vessels  were primarily for the King's service, but when unemployed were allowed  to be used in transporting merchants' goods, under certain regulations.  The next statement in the same letter gives some idea of the magnitude  of the transactions involved in the various departments in this region  at the period: \"I have drawn a bill of L14,760-9-5\"--nearly $74,000--\"on  acct. of sundries furnished Indians by Maj. Butler, also another on  acct. of Naval Dept. at Detroit for L4,070-18-9. Between us I am  heartily sick of bills and accounts and if the other posts are as  expensive to Government as this has been I think Old England had done  much better in letting the savages take possession of them than to have  put herself to half the enormous sum she has been at in keeping them.  Neither does the climate agree with my constitution, which has already  suffered by being employed many years in the West Indies and Florida,  for I have been extremely ill the two winters I have spent here with  rheumatism and a disorder in my breast.\"    One source of annoyance to Bolton was a detachment of Hessians which was  sent to augment the garrison at Fort Niagara. Col. Bolton did not find  them to his liking, nor was life at a backwoods post at all congenial to  these mercenaries, fighting England's battles to pay their monarch's  debts. They refused to work on the fortifications at Niagara; whereupon,  in November, 1779, Col. Bolton packed them off down to Carleton Island.  Alexander Fraser, in charge of that post, wrote to Gen. Haldimand that  he had ordered the \"jagers\" to be replaced by a company of the 34th.  \"Capt. Count Wittgenstein,\" he added, \"fears bad consequences should the  Jagers be ordered to return.\" Nowhere in America does the British  employment of Hessian troops appear to have been less satisfactory than  on this frontier. At Carleton Island, as at Niagara, they refused to  work, many of them were accused of selling their necessaries for rum,  and the Count de Wittgenstein himself was reprimanded.    There were difficulties, too, with the lake service. Desertion and  discontent followed an attempt to shorten the seamen's rations. In the  summer of '78, the sailors on board the snow Seneca, at Niagara, asked  to be discharged, alleging that their time had expired the preceding  November, and the yet more remarkable reason that they objected to the  service because they had been brought up on shore and life on the  rolling deep of Lake Ontario afforded \"no opportunity of exercising our  Religion, neither does confinement agree with our healths.\" Like many  lake sailors at this period they were probably French Canadian  Catholics, with loyalty none too strong to the British cause.    Bolton stuck to his post throughout that season, the year of alarm that  followed, and the succeeding period of distress. The most frequent  entries in his letters record the arrival of war parties, and his  anxiety over the enormous expense incurred for the Indians by Maj.  Butler. \"Scalps and prisoners are coming in every day, which is all the  news this place affords,\" he writes in June, '78; and again, the same  month: \"Ninety savages are just arrived with thirteen scalps and two  prisoners, and forty more with two scalps are expected. All of these  gentry, I am informed, must be clothed.\"[16] While there does not seem  ever to have been an open break between Bolton and Butler, yet the  former looked with dismay, if not disapproval, upon the endless  expenditure incurred for the Indians. In August, 1778, he wrote: \"Maj.  Butler, chief of the Indian Department, gives orders to the merchants to  supply the savages with everything to answer their demands, of which  undoubtedly he is the best judge and only person who can satisfy them or  keep them in temper. He also signs a certificate that the goods and cash  issued and paid by his order were indispensably necessary for the  government of His Majesty's service. The commanding officer of this  post is thus obliged to draw bills for the amount of all these accounts,  of which it is impossible he can be a judge or know anything about.... I  only mention these things to show Yr Excellency the disagreeable part  that falls to my lot as commanding officer; besides this is such a  complicated command that even an officer of much superior abilities than  I am master of, would find himself sometimes not a little embarrassed at  this Post.\"    Bolton was seriously ill during the winter of '79-'80, as indeed were  many of his garrison. In April, 1780, he reports his wretched health to  Gen. Haldimand. All through the succeeding summer he stuck to his post;  but on September 13th, worn out and discouraged, he asked to be allowed  to retire from the command of the upper posts and lakes. September 30th  he again wrote, begging for leave of absence. Some weeks later the  desired permission was sent, and Bolton determined to stay no longer.  Late in October the new Ontario, which Capt. Shank had built across the  river from the fort, was finished and rigged; she carried sixteen guns,  and was declared ready for service. She was ordered to convey a company  of the 34th down to Carleton Island. It was a notable departure. The  season was so late, no other opportunity for crossing Lake Ontario might  be afforded until spring. Lieut. Royce, with thirty men of the 34th,  embarked, under orders; so did Lieut. Colleton of the Royal Artillery.  Capt. Andrews, superintendent of naval construction, at whose  solicitations the Ontario had been built, being at Fort Niagara at the  time, also took passage. There was the full complement of officers and  crew. Several passengers--licensed Indian traders and fur merchants,  probably--crowded aboard; and among those who sailed away from Fort  Niagara that last October day, was Col. Bolton. It was the Ontario's  first voyage; and we may be sure that there was no lack of speculation  and wise opinion in the throng of spectators who watched her round the  bar at the mouth of the river and take her course down the lake. The old  criticism about her flat bottom and lack of draught was sure to be  recalled. But the Ontario, with her notable passenger list, had sailed,  and the only port she ever reached was the bottom of the lake. It is  supposed she foundered, some forty miles east of Niagara, near a place  called Golden Hill. On the beach there, some days after, a few articles  were found, supposed to have come ashore; but no other sign, no word of  the Ontario or of any of the throng that sailed in her has been had from  that day to this. In due time news of the loss reached Quebec. Sincere  but short were the expressions of sorrow in the correspondence that  followed. \"The loss of so many good officers and men,\" wrote Haldimand,  \"particularly at this period, and the disappointment of forwarding  provisions for the great consumption at the upper posts, will be  severely felt.\"[17] It was the fortune of war, and already the thought  turned to those who had depended upon a return cargo of provisions by  the Ontario. And so passes Mason Bolton out of the history of Fort  Niagara.            What Befel David Ogden.          WHAT BEFEL DAVID OGDEN.      It was my privilege, in the summer of 1896, to share in the exercises  which marked the Centennial of the delivery of Fort Niagara by Great  Britain to the United States. As I stood in that old stronghold on the  bank above the blue lake, strolled across the ancient parade ground, or  passed from one historic building to another, I found myself constantly  forgetting the actual day and hour, and slipping back a century or two.  There was a great crowd at Fort Niagara on this August day; thousands of  people--citizens, officials, soldiers and pleasure-seekers; but with  them came and went, to my retrospective vision, many more thousands yet:  missionary priests, French adventurers, traders, soldiers of the  scarlet, and of the buff and blue. I saw Butler's Rangers in their green  suits; and I saw a horde of savages, now begging for rations from the  King's stores, now coming in from their forays, famished but exultant,  displaying the scalps they had taken, or leading their ragged and  woebegone captives. It was upon these captives, whose romantic  misfortunes make a long and dramatic chapter in the history of Fort  Niagara, that my regard was prone to center. Their stories have nowhere  been told, so far as I am aware, as a part of the history of the place;  many of them never can be told; but of others some details may be  recorded.    Throughout the whole period of the Revolutionary War, Fort Niagara was a  garrisoned British post, of varying strength. It was the supply depot  for all arms and provisions which were destined for the upper posts of  Detroit and Michillimackinac; it was the rendezvous of the Senecas, who  worked the Government for all the blankets and guns, trinkets and  provisions which they could get; it was the headquarters of Col. Guy  Johnson, Indian Superintendent; and it was the resting-place and base of  operations of They-en-dan-e-gey-ah--in English, Joseph Brant; of Butler  and his rangers, and of numerous other less famous but more cruel  Indians, British and Tory leaders. No American troops reached Fort  Niagara to attack it. Only once was it even threatened. Yet throughout  the whole period of the war parties sallied forth from Fort Niagara to  plunder, capture or kill the rebel settlers wherever they could be  reached.    Sixty years ago Judge Samuel De Veaux wrote of this phase of the history  of Fort Niagara:         This old fort"]]]
