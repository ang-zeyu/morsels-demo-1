In its rugged  Apennines, which around Cagli tower to the height of 5000 feet, no  valuable minerals have been discovered; nor do its mountain torrents  admit of navigation, but with two coast-harbours this was scarcely  felt as a privation.    For the topography of the duchy our chief authority is Cimarelli, who  wrote about two centuries ago, and who begins it about forty years  after the flood! It was an absurd whim of Italian mediaeval authors,  which has prevailed almost till the present day, to wander among the  traditional or imaginary cycles of remote ages, extolling the  antiquity of their theme at a sacrifice of truth and credibility. Into  such extravagances we shall not be tempted. It is enough to say that  this district formed part of ancient Umbria, and is in some degree  identical with that known to Roman history as Gallia Senonia. When the  Western Empire crumbled to pieces, it was broken up into many petty  communities, some of which adopted for themselves republican  institutions, while others fell into the hands of military  adventurers, who transmitted their sway to their descendants in  hereditary right, founded upon personal enterprise or the consent of  their subjects. After the nominal regimen of the occidental empire had  been transferred across the Alps, these new communities and counts  often sought from its titular emperor a confirmation of their  self-constituted rights. This demand, recognising in name a  sovereignty already substantially theirs, was willingly accorded as  the basis of a transaction flattering to one party, momentous to the  other. But the gradually opening ambition of the Church, and the  extension of her temporal rule into Romagna and La Marca by the  donations of Pepin, Charlemagne, and the Countess Matilda, introduced  another competitor for dominion in these provinces. Her claim was made  good, in some cases by a voluntary surrender on the part of men whose  piety prevailed over their love of power, in others by force of arms;  but by most of the mountain chiefs, and by a few of the free towns,  loyalty to the emperor's shadowy authority was used as a pretext for  resisting a new element which threatened their own sway. The two rival  parties which sprang out of these circumstances came to be  distinguished as Guelph and Ghibelline, although their watchwords were  often adopted by local or temporary factions.    Many circumstances tended to an extensive establishment of political  independence among the small states thus formed in Italy during the  Middle Ages. Distance and the unsettled state of the Peninsula having  reduced to little more than a name the direct imperial sovereignty of                           \"That imperious bird,       Whose double beak a double prey devours,\"[10]    the emperors endeavoured to render it still available to their  political importance, through the intervention of military  vicegerents. To each of these a certain territory was conveyed,  generally with the title of count, which they were understood to  govern for behoof of the empire. Practically, however, they were  nearly secure against any strict accounting for their stewardship,  and, provided they attended the imperial banner in the field with a  befitting following, paid with tolerable regularity the annual  _cense_, or contribution exigible under their tenure, and did homage  as vassals at the imperial coronations, they were allowed to enjoy or  abuse unquestioned what rights of sovereignty they thought fit to  assume. Nor was there any effective check upon the marauding spirit of  conquest, which in that age formed the natural outlet of personal  ambition; and these feudatories were left to fight with their  neighbours whenever their swords were not called into requisition by  their common over-lord: still more were they allowed to deal  undisturbed with the people submitted to their jurisdiction, who were  of course presumed to endure and obey.    [Footnote 10:                     \"L'aquila grifagna       Che per piu divorar due becchi porta.\"         LUIGI ALAMANNI.]    At a period nearly coeval with the formation of these independent  fiefs, and much antecedent to the aggregation of civic communities in  other parts of Europe, we find the peninsular towns advancing into  importance. Their establishment was favoured by the absence of a  perfect feudal organisation,[*11] for men exempt from such fetters  associated together more readily than those in transalpine lands. The  fertility of the soil, and consequent density of population, admitted  of cultivators congregating in homes of their own choice; and the  malaria generated in that luxurious climate often rendered isolated  dwellings insalubrious.[*12] The peasant-hamlets thus formed were  quickly augmented by the influx of all who sought protection from  external foes or tyrannical masters. The increase of population  brought strength; strength gave security; security attracted wealth  and numbers; and these united elements created intelligence and public  spirit, the only sure basis of liberty. Their first necessity being  self-defence, their dwellings were placed in sites of natural  strength, and soon girt by walls. The enemies they most dreaded were  the adjoining lords, to whose jurisdiction they nominally belonged,  but whose claims they were not unfrequently able to meet, either by  formidable resistance, or by a charter of privileges, which the  emperors, ever willing to curb their barons, were seldom loath to  accord. The independence thus wrung from the counts was cemented by  the spirit of civic liberty, while the development of municipal  strength and privileges gave to citizens a social and political  pre-eminence over the rural population, beyond what they attained in  countries where feudalism served to link the agricultural class with  the central authority. Among men united for a common object, and  thrown upon their own resources, the popular element early developed  itself. Such communities finding themselves without a master, a  position which, when real freedom was unknown, only exposed them to  attacks from stronger neighbours, their instinct of self-preservation,  ere long, induced attempts at self-government. Townships consequently  multiplied, developed themselves into cities, and became republics.    [Footnote *11: This may be, and indeed is so; but see LANZANI, _St. d.  Comuni Italiani dal. Orig. al_ 1313 (Milano, 1882), lib. I., _passim_.  Nevertheless, the relation of all the Dukes and Signori to the Empire  or to the Church was absolutely feudal as I understand the term, as in  essence was, in turn, the relation of a city to its contado. Cf. D.  WINSPEARE, _St. d. Abusi Feudali_ (ed. 1883), to which is added as  appendix an article by F. de Coulanges on the feudal regime. See also  C. CANTU, _St. d. Italiani_ (Torino, 1854), tom. III., cap. LXXIV.,  pp. 224-39. C. CALISSE, _St. d. Diretto Italiano_ (Firenze, 1891),  vol. II., parte II. e III.]    [Footnote *12: For the malaria in Italy in the Middle Age, see  AQUARONE, _Dante in Siena_ (Siena, 1889), p. 47-9.]    Thus rose the Italian republics, not as is often superficially  supposed, in the mercantile cities alone, but in almost every township  of Upper Italy. Their constitutional forms not only varied from each  other, but were constantly fluctuating, under a desire for novelty,  the contests of rival factions, and the influence of external events.  Republics they were, in so far as they owned no hereditary head. They  believed themselves self-governed, because their ever-recurring  revolutions were their own act, or at least were effected by their own  instrumentality. But the democratic element seldom long existed in  purity.[*13] After the _emeute_ was over, a self-constituted  oligarchy, a rich and designing citizen, or an ambitious prelate,  often stepped in, to enjoy that power for which the people had fought,  until these, roused by some too undisguised tyranny, or by some new  caprice, rushed to the piazza, and threw off their masters, leaving it  to chance or intrigue to give them new ones.    [Footnote *13: I doubt a true democratic element anywhere; perhaps for  a few decades in Perugia.]    Lamartine, the eloquent advocate and partially successful hero of  popular rights, has admitted that there can be no progress unless  \"many interests are injured,\" and that \"such transformations are not  operated without great resistance, without an infinity of anguish and  private misfortune.\" This, however, is no place to raise the question,  how far the benefit of so much political liberty was balanced by the  inadequate guarantee of person and property, inherent in such a state  of things, or whether the security of domestic peace would have been  too dearly purchased by a partial sacrifice of popular power. Yet few  who argue these points will deny that whatever influence the  republican constitutions of Italy may have had upon the individual  happiness of their own citizens, they sowed the seeds of that  intelligence, that freedom of thought, that ardent aspiration for the  amelioration of mankind, which have ever since so beneficially acted  upon European civilisation.    The liberty of Italian republics has been frequently misapprehended,  and will disappoint those who seek in it such safeguards of life and  property as freedom in its modern sense is understood to afford. Under  no form of civilised government were those guarantees more feeble or  ineffective than where tyranny of the wayward and irresponsible many  was substituted for domination by one. The philosophic Guizot has even  condemned these republics as \"utterly irreconcilable with security for  life (that first ingredient in social existence) and with progress;\"  as \"incapable of developing freedom or extending the scope of  institutions;\" as tending to \"limit their range and concentrate  authority in a few individuals.\" To these conclusions we must "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42622"],[0,"The Book of Christmas (#16)"],[1," the amusements  themselves exhibit nearly as much wisdom as those of the court (with  less of pretension), and we dare say created a great deal more fun at a  far less cost. As to the Scottish practices, our readers will not fail  to observe from our last quotation that the lordly Abbot and his train  were little better than a set of morris-dancers themselves, and that so  much of their practices as was innocent differed nothing from those  which Stubs and his brother Puritans deemed so ridiculous in a set of  parish revellers. In fact, the Lord of Misrule seems to have set himself  up all over the land; and many a village had its master Simon who took  care that the sports should not languish for want of that unity of  purpose and concentration of mirth to which some directing authority is  so essential.    We have already stated, and have made it quite apparent in our  descriptions, that the Christmas celebrations of the more exalted  classes are not put forward for the consideration of our readers on the  ground of any great wisdom in the matter or humor in the manner of those  celebrations themselves. But we claim for them serious veneration, in  right of the excellence of the spirit in which they originated, and the  excellence of the result which they produced. The very extravagance of  the court pageantries--their profuse expenditure and grotesque  displays--were so many evidences of the hearty reception which was given  to the season in the highest places, and so many conspicuous sanctions  under which the spirit of unrestrained rejoicing made its appeals in the  lowest. This ancient festival of all ranks, consecrated by all religious  feelings and all moral influences; this privileged season of the lowly;  this Sabbath of the poor man's year,--was recognized by his superiors  with high observance and honored by his governors with ceremonious  state. The mirth of the humble and uneducated man received no check from  the assumption of an unseasonable gravity or ungenerous reserve on the  part of those with whom fortune had dealt more kindly, and to whom  knowledge had opened her stores. The moral effect of all this was of the  most valuable kind. Nothing so much promotes a reciprocal kindliness of  feeling as a community of enjoyment; and the bond of good will was thus  drawn tighter between those remote classes, whose differences of  privilege, of education, and of pursuit, are perpetually operating to  loosen it, and threatening to dissolve it altogether. There was a great  deal of wisdom in all this; and the result was well worth producing even  at the cost of much more folly than our ancestors expended on it. We  deny that spectacles and a wig are the inseparable symbols of sapience;  and we hold that portion of the world to be greatly mistaken which  supposes that wisdom may not occasionally put on the cap and bells, and  under that disguise be wisdom still! The ancient custom which made what  was called a fool a part of the establishment of princes, and gave him a  right in virtue of his bauble to teach many a wise lesson and utter many  a wholesome truth--besides its practical utility, contained as excellent  a moral and was conceived in as deep a spirit as the still more ancient  one of the skeleton at a feast. \"_Cucullus non facit monachum_,\" says  one of those privileged gentry, in the pages of one who, we are sure,  could have enacted a Christmas foolery with the most foolish, and yet  had \"sounded all the depths and shallows\" of the human mind, and was  himself the wisest of modern men. \"Better a witty fool than a foolish  wit.\" There is a long stride from the wisdom of that sneering  philosopher who laughed _at_ his fellows to his who on proper occasions  can laugh _with_ them; and in spite of all that modern philosophy may  say to the contrary, there was in the very extravagances of Coke and  Hatton, and other lawyers and statesmen of past times--if they aimed at  such a result as that which we have mentioned, and in so far as they  contributed thereto--more real wisdom than all which they enunciated in  their more solemn moods, or have put upon record in their books of the  law.    [Illustration: GATE OF THE \"OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN.\"--_Page 109._]    In the same excellent spirit, too, everything was done that could assist  in promoting the same valuable effect; and while the pageantries which  were prepared by the court and by other governing bodies furnished a  portion of the entertainments by which the populace tasted the season in  towns, and sanctioned the rest, care was taken in many ways (of which we  have given an example) that the festival should be spread over the  country, and provision made for its maintenance in places more secluded  and remote. A set of arrangements sprang up which left no man without  their influence; and figuratively and literally, the crumbs from the  table of the rich man's festival were abundantly enjoyed by the veriest  beggar at his gate. The kindly spirit of Boaz was abroad in all the  land, and every Ruth had leave to \"eat of the bread and dip her morsel  in the vinegar.\" At that great harvest of rejoicing, all men were  suffered to glean; and they with whom at most other seasons the world  had \"dealt very bitterly\"--whose names were Mara, and who ate sparingly  of the bread of toil--gleaned \"even among its sheaves,\" and no man  reproached them. The old English gentleman, like the generous  Bethlehemite in the beautiful story, even scattered that the poor might  gather, and \"commanded his young men saying, . . . 'Let fall also some  of the handfuls of purpose for them and leave them, that they may glean  them, and rebuke them not.'\" And the prayer of many a Naomi went up in  answer, \"Blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee;\" \"blessed be he  of the Lord!\"    In a word, the blaze of royal and noble celebration was as a great  beacon to the land, seen afar off by those who could not share in its  warmth or sit under the influence of its immediate inspirations. But it  was answered from every hill-top and repeated in every valley of  England; and each man flung the Yule log on his own fire at the cheering  signal. The hearth, according to Aubrey, at the first introduction of  coals, was usually in the middle of the room; and he derives from thence  the origin of the saying, \"round about our coal fire.\" But whether the  huge fagot crackled and flustered within those merry circles or flared  and roared up the ample chimneys,--all social feelings, and all  beautiful superstitions and old traditions and local observances awoke  at the blaze; and from their thousand hiding-places crept out the  customs and ceremonials which crowd this festal period of the year, and  of which it is high time that we should proceed to give an account in  these pages. The charmed log that (duly lighted with the last year's  brand, which, as we learn from Herrick, was essential to its virtue)  scared away all evil spirits, attracted all beneficent ones. The 'squire  sat in the midst of his tenants as a patriarch might amid his family,  and appears to have had no less reverence, though he compounded the  wassail-bowl with his own hands and shared it with the meanest of his  dependants. The little book from which we have more than once quoted by  the title of \"Round about our Coal-fire,\" furnishes us with an example  of this reverence too ludicrous to be omitted. Its writer tells us that  if the 'squire had occasion to ask one of his neighbors what o'clock it  was, he received for answer a profound bow and an assurance that it was  what o'clock his worship pleased,--an answer, no doubt, indicative of  profound respect, but not calculated to convey much useful information  to the inquirer. In fine, however, while the glad spirit of the season  covered the land, hospitality and harmony were everywhere a portion of  that spirit. The light of a common festival shone for once upon the  palace and the cottage, and the chain of a universal sympathy descended  unbroken through all ranks, from the prince to the peasant and the  beggar.        \"The damsel donned her kirtle sheen;       The hall was dress'd with holly green;       Forth to the wood did merry men go,       To gather in the misletoe.       Then opened wide the baron's hall,       To vassall, tenant, serf and all;       Power laid his rod of rule aside,       And ceremony doffed his pride.       The heir, with roses in his shoes,       _Those nights_ might village partner chuse;       The lord, underogating, share       The vulgar game of 'post-and-pair.'           .     .     .     .     .     .     .         The fire with well-dried logs supplied,       Went roaring up the chimney wide;       The huge hall-table's oaken face,       Scrubbed till it shone, the _time_ to grace,       Bore then upon its massive board       No mark to part the 'squire and lord.       Then was brought in the lusty brawn,       By old blue-coated serving-man;       Then the grim boar's head frowned on high,       Crested with bays and rosemary.       Well can the green-garbed ranger tell,       How, when, and where, the monster fell;       What dogs, before his death, he tore,       And all the batings of the boar.       The wassail round, in good brown bowls,       Garnished with ribbons, blithely trowls.       There the huge sirloin reeked; hard by       Plumb-porridge stood, and Christmas pye;       Nor failed old Scotland to produce,       At such high-tide, her savoury goose.       Then came the merry masquers in,       And carols roared with blithesome din;       If unmelodious was the song,       It was a hearty note, and strong.       Who lists may, in their mumming, see       Traces of ancient mystery;       White shirts supplied the masquerade,       And smutted cheeks the visors made:       But, Oh! what masquers, richly dight,       Can boast of bosoms half so light?       England was merry England, when       Old Christmas"]]]
