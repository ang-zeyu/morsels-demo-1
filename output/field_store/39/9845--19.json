She stared at him stupidly, trying to think what he meant.    \"Come, come!\" growled the conductor, \"either pay up or get off!\"    Still she did not understand, and he grabbed her rudely by the arm  and lifted her to her feet. But when his hand came in contact with  the hard wood of which her arm was made the fellow was filled with  surprise. He stooped down and peered into her face, and, seeing it  was wax instead of flesh, he gave a yell of fear and jumped from the  car, running as if he had seen a ghost.    At this the other passengers also yelled and sprang from the car,  fearing a collision; and the motorman, knowing something was wrong,  followed suit. The wax lady, seeing the others run, jumped from the  car last of all, and stepped in front of another car coming at full  speed from the opposite direction.    She heard cries of fear and of warning on all sides, but before she  understood her danger she was knocked down and dragged for half a  block.    When the car was brought to a stop a policeman reached down and  pulled her from under the wheels. Her dress was badly torn and  soiled. Her left ear was entirely gone, and the left side of her  head was caved in; but she quickly scrambled to her feet and asked  for her hat. This a gentleman had already picked up, and when the  policeman handed it to her and noticed the great hole in her head  and the hollow place it disclosed, the poor fellow trembled so  frightfully that his knees actually knocked together.    \"Why--why, ma'am, you're killed!\" he gasped.    \"What does it mean to be killed?\" asked the wax lady.    The policeman shuddered and wiped the perspiration from his  forehead.    \"You're it!\" he answered, with a groan.    The crowd that had collected were looking upon the lady wonderingly,  and a middle-aged gentleman now exclaimed:    \"Why, she's wax!\"    \"Wax!\" echoed the policeman.    \"Certainly. She's one of those dummies they put in the windows,\"  declared the middle-aged man.    The people who had collected shouted: \"You're right!\" \"That's what  she is!\" \"She's a dummy!\"    \"Are you?\" inquired the policeman, sternly.    The wax lady did not reply. She began to fear she was getting into  trouble, and the staring crowd seemed to embarrass her.    Suddenly a bootblack attempted to solve the problem by saying: \"You  guys is all wrong! Can a dummy talk? Can a dummy walk? Can a dummy  live?\"    \"Hush!\" murmured the policeman. \"Look here!\" and he pointed to the  hold in the lady's head. The newsboy looked, turned pale and  whistled to keep himself from shivering.    A second policeman now arrived, and after a brief conference it was  decided to take the strange creature to headquarters. So they called  a hurry-up wagon, and the damaged wax lady was helped inside and  driven to the police station. There the policeman locked her in a  cell and hastened to tell Inspector Mugg their wonderful story.    Inspector Mugg had just eaten a poor breakfast, and was not in a  pleasant mood; so he roared and stormed at the unlucky policemen,  saying they were themselves dummies to bring such a fairy tale to a  man of sense. He also hinted that they had been guilty of  intemperance.    The policemen tried to explain, but Inspector Mugg would not listen;  and while they were still disputing in rushed Mr. Floman, the owner  of the department store.    \"I want a dozen detectives, at once, inspector!\" he cried.    \"What for?\" demanded Mugg.    \"One of the wax ladies has escaped from my store and eloped with a  $19.98 costume, a $4.23 hat, a $2.19 parasol and a 76-cent pair of  gloves, and I want her arrested!\"    While he paused for breath the inspector glared at him in amazement.    \"Is everybody going crazy at the same time?\" he inquired,  sarcastically. \"How could a wax dummy run away?\"    \"I don't know; but she did. When my janitor opened the door this  morning he saw her run out.\"    \"Why didn't he stop her?\" asked Mugg.    \"He was too frightened. But she's stolen my property, your honor,  and I want her arrested!\" declared the storekeeper.    The inspector thought for a moment.    \"You wouldn't be able to prosecute her,\" he said, \"for there's no  law against dummies stealing.\"    Mr. Floman sighed bitterly.    \"Am I to lose that $19.98 costume and the $4.25 hat and--\"    \"By no means,\" interrupted Inspector Mugg. \"The police of this city  are ever prompt to act in defense of our worthy citizens. We have  already arrested the wax lady, and she is locked up in cell No. 16.  You may go there and recover your property, if you wish, but before  you prosecute her for stealing you'd better hunt up a law that  applies to dummies.\"    \"All I want,\" said Mr. Floman, \"is that $19.98 costume and--\"    \"Come along!\" interrupted the policeman. \"I'll take you to the  cell.\"    But when they entered No. 16 they found only a lifeless dummy lying  prone upon the floor. Its wax was cracked and blistered, its head  was badly damaged, and the bargain costume was dusty, soiled and  much bedraggled. For the mischief-loving Tanko-Mankie had flown by  and breathed once more upon the poor wax lady, and in that instant  her brief life ended.    \"It's just as I thought,\" said Inspector Mugg, leaning back in his  chair contentedly. \"I knew all the time the thing was a fake. It  seems sometimes as though the whole world would go crazy if there  wasn't some level-headed man around to bring 'em to their senses.  Dummies are wood an' wax, an' that's all there is of 'em.\"    \"That may be the rule,\" whispered the policeman to himself, \"but  this one were a dummy as lived!\"          THE KING OF THE POLAR BEARS      The King of the Polar Bears lived among the icebergs in the far  north country. He was old and monstrous big; he was wise and  friendly to all who knew him. His body was thickly covered with  long, white hair that glistened like silver under the rays of the  midnight sun. His claws were strong and sharp, that he might walk  safely over the smooth ice or grasp and tear the fishes and seals  upon which he fed.    The seals were afraid when he drew near, and tried to avoid him; but  the gulls, both white and gray, loved him because he left the  remnants of his feasts for them to devour.    Often his subjects, the polar bears, came to him for advice when ill  or in trouble; but they wisely kept away from his hunting grounds,  lest they might interfere with his sport and arouse his anger.    The wolves, who sometimes came as far north as the icebergs,  whispered among themselves that the King of the Polar Bears was  either a magician or under the protection of a powerful fairy. For  no earthly thing seemed able to harm him; he never failed to secure  plenty of food, and he grew bigger and stronger day by day and year  by year.    Yet the time came when this monarch of the north met man, and his  wisdom failed him.    He came out of his cave among the icebergs one day and saw a boat  moving through the strip of water which had been uncovered by the  shifting of the summer ice. In the boat were men.    The great bear had never seen such creatures before, and therefore  advanced toward the boat, sniffing the strange scent with aroused  curiosity and wondering whether he might take them for friends or  foes, food or carrion.    When the king came near the water's edge a man stood up in the boat  and with a queer instrument made a loud \"bang!\" The polar bear felt  a shock; his brain became numb; his thoughts deserted him; his great  limbs shook and gave way beneath him and his body fell heavily upon  the hard ice.    That was all he remembered for a time.    When he awoke he was smarting with pain on every inch of his huge  bulk, for the men had cut away his hide with its glorious white hair  and carried it with them to a distant ship.    Above him circled thousands of his friends the gulls, wondering if  their benefactor were really dead and it was proper to eat him. But  when they saw him raise his head and groan and tremble they knew he  still lived, and one of them said to his comrades:    \"The wolves were right. The king is a great magician, for even men  cannot kill him. But he suffers for lack of covering. Let us repay  his kindness to us by each giving him as many feathers as we can  spare.\"    This idea pleased the gulls. One after another they plucked with  their beaks the softest feathers from under their wings, and, flying  down, dropped then gently upon the body of the King of the Polar  Bears.    Then they called to him in a chorus:    \"Courage, friend! Our feathers are as soft and beautiful as your own  shaggy hair. They will guard you from the cold winds and warm you  while you sleep. Have courage, then, and live!\"    And the King of the Polar Bears had courage to bear his pain and  lived and was strong again.    The feathers grew as they had grown upon the bodies of the birds and  covered him as his own hair had done. Mostly they were pure white in  color, but some from the gray gulls gave his majesty a slight  mottled appearance.    The rest of that summer and all through the six months of night the  king left his icy cavern only to fish or catch seals for food. He  felt no shame at his feathery covering, but it was still strange to  him, and he avoided meeting any of his brother bears.    During this period of retirement he thought much of the men who had  harmed him, and remembered the way they had made the great \"bang!\"  And he decided it was best to keep away from such fierce creatures.  Thus he added to his store of wisdom.    When the moon fell away from the sky and the sun came to make the  icebergs glitter with the gorgeous tintings of the rainbow, two of  the polar bears arrived at the king's cavern to ask his advice about  the hunting season. But when they saw his great body covered with  feathers instead of hair they began to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4358"],[0,"The Sea Fairies (#16)"],[1,".  They swam slowly after him and breathed easier when they had left  the golden domed chamber where their wicked enemy sat enthroned.  \"Well, how do you like him?\" asked Sacho with a laugh.    \"We hate him!\" declared Trot emphatically.    \"Of course you do,\" replied Sacho. \"But you're wasting time hating  anything. It doesn't do you any good, or him any harm. Can you  sing?\"    \"A little,\" said Trot, \"but I don't feel like singing now.\"    \"You're wrong about that,\" the boy asserted. \"Anything that keeps  you from singing is foolishness, unless it's laughter. Laughter, joy  and song are the only good things in the world.\"    Trot did not answer this queer speech, for just then they came to a  flight of stairs, and Sacho climbed up them while the others swam.  And now they were in a lofty, broad corridor having many doors hung  with seaweed draperies. At one of these doorways Sacho stopped and  said, \"Here is the Rose Chamber where the master commands you to  live until you die. You may wander anywhere in the castle as you  please; to leave it is impossible. Whenever you return to the Rose  Chamber, you will know it by this design of roses sewn in pearls  upon the hangings. The Peony Room where the man-fish is to live is  the next one farther on.\"    \"Thank you,\" replied Queen Aquareine. \"Are we to be fed?\"    \"Meals will be served in your rooms. If you desire anything, ring  the bell and some of the slaves will be sure to answer it. I am  mostly in attendance upon my master, but whenever I am at liberty I  will look after your comfort myself.\"    Again they thanked the strange boy, and he turned and left them.  They could hear him whistle and sing as he returned along the  passage. Then Princess Clia parted the curtains that her queen and  companions might enter the Rose Chamber.          CHAPTER 14    CAP'N JOE AND CAP'N BILL      The rooms Zog had given his prisoners were as handsome as all other  parts of this strange enchanted castle. Gold was used plentifully in  the decorations, and in the Rose Chamber occupied by the mermaids  and Trot golden roses formed a border around the entire room. The  sea maidens had evidently been expected, for the magician had  provided couches for them to recline upon similar to the ones used  in the mermaid palaces. The frames were of mother of pearl and the  cushions of soft, white sponges. In the room were toilet tables,  mirrors, ornaments and many articles used by earth people, which  they afterward learned had been plundered by Zog from sunken ships  and brought to his castle by his allies, the sea devils.    While the mermaids were examining and admiring their room, Cap'n  Bill went to the Peony Room to see what it was like and found his  quarters were very cozy and interesting. There were pictures on the  wall, portraits of grave-looking porpoises, bashful seals, and smug  and smiling walruses. Some of the wall panels were formed of mirrors  and reflected clearly the interior of the room. Around the ceiling  was a frieze of imitation peonies in silver, and the furniture was  peony-shaped, the broad leaves being bent to form seats and couches.  Beside a pretty dressing table hung a bell cord with a tassel at the  end. Cap'n Bill did not know it was a bell cord, so he pulled it to  see what would happen and was puzzled to find that nothing seemed to  happen at all, the bell being too far away for him to hear it. Then  he began looking at the treasures contained in this royal apartment,  and was much pleased with a golden statue of a mermaid that  resembled Princess Clia in feature. A silver flower vase upon a  stand contained a bouquet of gorgeous peonies, \"as nat'ral as life,\"  said Cap'n Bill, although he saw plainly that they must be made of  metal.    Trot came in just then to see how her dear friend was located. She  entered from the doorway that connected the two rooms and said,  \"Isn't it pretty, Cap'n? And who'd ever think that awful creature  Zog owned such a splendid castle and kept his prisoners in such  lovely rooms?\"    \"I once heard tell,\" said the sailor, \"of a foreign people that  sacrificed humans to please their pagan gods, an' before they killed  'em outright they stuffed the victims full of good things to eat an'  dressed 'em in pretty clothes an' treated 'em like princes. That's  why I don't take much comfort in our fine surroundin's, Trot. This  Zog is a pagan, if ever there was one, an' he don't mean us any  good, you may depend on 't.\"    \"No,\" replied Trot soberly, \"I'm sure he does not expect us to be  happy here. But I'm going to fool him and have just as good a time  as I can.\" As she spoke they both turned around--an easy thing to do  with a single flop of their flexible tails--and Cap'n Bill uttered a  cry of surprise. Just across the room stood a perfect duplicate of  himself. The round head, with its bald top and scraggly whiskers,  the sailor cap and shirt, the wide pantaloons, even the wooden leg,  each and every one were exact copies of those owned by Cap'n Bill.  Even the expression in the light-blue eyes was the same, and it is  no wonder the old sailor stared at his \"double\" in amazement. But  the next minute he laughed and said, \"Why, Trot, it's ME reflected  in a mirror. But at first I thought it was someone else.\"    Trot was staring, too. \"Look, Cap'n!\" she whispered. \"Look at the  wooden leg.\"    \"Well, it's MY wooden leg, ain't it?\" he inquired.    \"If it is, it can't be a reflection in a mirror,\" she argued, \"for  YOU haven't got a wooden leg. You've got a fish's tail.\"    The old sailor was so startled by this truth that he gave a great  flop with his tail that upset his balance and made him keel a  somersault in the water before he got right side up again. Then he  found the other sailor man laughing at him and was horrified to find  the \"reflection\" advancing toward them by stumping along on its  wooden leg. \"Keep away! Get out, there!\" yelled Cap'n Bill. \"You're  a ghost, the ghost o' me that once was, an' I can't bear the sight  o' you. Git out!\"    \"Did you ring jes' to tell me to git out?\" asked the other in a mild  voice.    \"I--I didn't ring,\" declared Cap'n Bill.    \"You did. You pulled that bell cord,\" said the one-legged (one or  more lines missing here in this edition)    \"Oh, did pullin' that thing ring a bell?\" inquired the Cap'n, a  little ashamed of his ignorance and reassured by hearing the \"ghost\"  talk.    \"It surely did,\" was the reply, \"and Sacho told me to answer your  bell and look after you. So I'm a-lookin' after you.\"    \"I wish you wouldn't,\" protested Cap'n Bill. \"I've no use fer--fer  ghostses, anyhow.\"    The strange sailor began to chuckle at hearing this, and his chuckle  was just like Cap'n Bill's chuckle, so full of merry humor that it  usually made everyone laugh with him.    \"Who are you?\" asked Trot, who was very curious and much surprised.    \"I'm Cap'n Joe,\" was the reply. \"Cap'n Joe Weedles, formerly o' the  brig 'Gladsome' an' now a slave o' Zog at the bottom o' the sea.\"    \"J--J--Joe Wee-Weedles!\" gasped Cap'n Bill, amazed. \"Joe Weedles o'  the 'Gladsome'! Why, dash my eyes, mate, you must be my brother!\"    \"Are YOU Bill Weedles?\" asked the other. And then he added, \"But no,  you can't be. Bill wasn't no mermaid. He were a human critter like  myself.\"    \"That's what I am,\" said Cap'n Bill hastily. \"I'm a human critter,  too. I've jes' borrered this fish tail to swim with while I'm  visitin' the mermaids.\"    \"Well, well,\" said Cap'n Joe in astonishment. \"Who'd o' thought it!  An' who'd ever o' thought as I'd find my long-lost brother in Zog's  enchanted castle full fifty fathoms deep down in the wet, wet  water!\"    \"Why, as fer that,\" replied Cap'n Bill, \"it's YOU as is the  long-lost brother, not me. You an' your ship disappeared many a year  ago, an' ain't never been heard of since, while, as you see, I'm  livin' on earth yet.\"    \"You don't look it to all appearances,\" remarked Cap'n Joe in a  reflective tone of voice. \"But I'll agree it's many a year since I  saw the top o' the water, an' I'm not expectin' to ever tramp on dry  land again.\"    \"Are you dead, or drownded, or what?\" asked Cap'n Bill.    \"Neither one nor t'other,\" was the answer. \"But Zog gave me gills  so's I could live in the water like fishes do, an' if I got on land  I couldn't breathe air any more'n a fish out o' water can. So I  guess as long as I live, I'll hev to stay down here.\"    \"Do you like it?\" asked Trot.    \"Oh, I don't objec' much,\" said Cap'n Joe. \"There ain't much  excitement here, fer we don't catch a flock o' mermaids ev'ry day,  but the work is easy an' the rations fair. I might o' been worse  off, you know, for when my brig was wrecked, I'd 'a' gone to Davy  Jones's Locker if Zog hadn't happened to find me an' made me a  fish.\"    \"You don't look as much like a fish as Cap'n Bill does,\" observed  Trot.    \"P'raps not,\" said Cap'n Joe, \"but I notice Bill ain't got any gills  an' breathes like you an' the mermaids does. When he gets back to  land, he'll have his two legs again an' live in comfort breathin'  air.\"    \"I won't have two legs,\" asserted Cap'n Bill, \"for when I'm on earth  I'm fitted with one wooden leg, jes' the same as you are, Joe.\"    \"Oh, I hadn't heard o' that, Bill, but I'm not surprised,\" replied  Brother Joe. \"Many a sailor gets to wear a wooden leg in time.  Mine's hick'ry.\"    \"So's mine,\" said Cap'n Bill with a air of pride. \"I'm glad I've run  across you, Joe, for I often wondered what had become of you. Seems  too bad, though, to have to spend all your life under water.\"    \"What's the odds?\" asked Cap'n Joe. \"I never could keep away from  the water since I was a boy, an' there's more dangers to be met  floatin' on it than there is soakin' in it. An' one other thing  pleases me when I think on it: I'm parted from my wife, a mighty  good woman with a tongue like a two-edge sword, an' my pore  widder'll get the insurance money an' live happy. As fer me, Bill,  I'm"]]]
