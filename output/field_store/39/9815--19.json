Girolamo Balbo, of the noble Venetian family, Bishop of Gurck,  in Carinthia.    XXXIII    NOW Messer Giovanni bought his favourite a very fine black horse, for  which he paid 150 crowns. The beast was admirably trained to hand, so  that Luigi could go daily to caracole around the lodgings of that  prostitute Pantasilea. Though I took notice of this, I paid it no  attention, only remarking that all things acted as their nature  prompted; and meanwhile I gave my whole mind to my studies. It came to  pass one Sunday evening that we were invited to sup together with the  Sienese sculptor, Michel Agnolo, and the time of the year was summer.  Bachiacca, of whom I have already spoken, was present at the party; and  he had brought with him his old flame, Pantasilea. When we were at  table, she sat between me and Bachiacca; but in the very middle of the  banquet she rose, and excused herself upon the pretext of a natural  need, saying she would speedily return. We, meanwhile, continued talking  very agreeably and supping; but she remained an unaccountably long time  absent. It chanced that, keeping my ears open, I thought I heard a sort  of subdued tittering in the street below. I had a knife in hand, which I  was using for my service at the table. The window was so close to where  I sat, that, by merely rising, I could see Luigi in the street, together  with Pantasilea; and I heard Luigi saying: Oh, if that devil Benvenuto  only saw us, shouldnt we just catch it! She answered: Have no fear;  only listen to the noise theyre making; we are the last thing theyre  thinking of. At these words, having made them both well out, I leaped  from the window, and took Luigi by the cape; and certainly I should then  have killed him with the knife I held, but that he was riding a white  horse, to which he clapped spurs, leaving his cape in my grasp, in order  to preserve his life. Pantasilea took to her heels in the direction of a  neighbouring church. The company at supper rose immediately, and came  down, entreating me in a body to refrain from putting myself and them to  inconvenience for a strumpet. I told them that I should not have let  myself be moved on her account, but that I was bent on punishing the  infamous young man, who showed how little he regarded me. Accordingly I  would not yield to the remonstrances of those ingenious and worthy men,  but took my sword, and went alone toward Prati:-the house where we were  supping, I should say, stood close to the Castello gate, which led to  Prati. [1] Walking thus upon the road to Prati, I had not gone far  before the sun sank, and I re-entered Rome itself at a slow pace. Night  had fallen; darkness had come on; but the gates of Rome were not yet  shut.    Toward two hours after sunset, I walked along Pantasileas lodging, with  the intention, if Luigi Pulci were there, of doing something to the  discontent of both. When I heard and saw that no one but a poor  servant-girl called Canida was in the house, I went to put away my cloak  and the scabbard of my sword, and then returned to the house, which  stood behind the Banchi on the river Tiber. Just opposite stretched a  garden belonging to an innkeeper called Romolo. It was enclosed by a  thick hedge of thorns, in which I hid myself, standing upright, and  waiting till the woman came back with Luigi. After keeping watch awhile  there, my friend Bachiacca crept up to me; whether led by his own  suspicions or by the advice of others, I cannot say. In a low voice he  called out to me: Gossip (for so we used to name ourselves for fun);  and then he prayed me for Gods love, using the words which follow, with  tears in the tone of his voice: Dear gossip, I entreat you not to  injure that poor girl; she at least has erred in no wise in this  matter-no, not at all. When I heard what he was saying, I replied: If  you dont take yourself off now, at this first word I utter, I will  bring my sword here down upon your head. Overwhelmed with fright, my  poor gossip was suddenly taken ill with the colic, and withdrew to ease  himself apart; indeed, he could not buy obey the call. There was a  glorious heaven of stars, which shed good light to see by. All of a  sudden I was aware of the noise of many horses; they were coming toward  me from the one side and the other. It turned out to be Luigi and  Pantasilea, attended by a certain Messer Benvegnato of Perugia, who was  chamberlain to Pope Clement, and followed by four doughty captains of  Perugia, with some other valiant soldiers in the flower of youth;  altogether reckoned, there were more than twelve swords. When I  understood the matter, and saw not how to fly, I did my best to crouch  into the hedge. But the thorns pricked and hurt me, goading me to  madness like a bull; and I had half resolved to take a leap and hazard  my escape. Just then Luigi, with his arm round Pantasileas neck, was  heard crying: I must kiss you once again, if only to insult that  traitor Benvenuto. At that moment, annoyed as I was by the prickles,  and irritated by the young mans words, I sprang forth, lifted my sword  on high, and shouted at the top of my voice: You are all dead folk! My  blow descended on the shoulder of Luigi; but the satyrs who doted on  him, had steeled his person round with coasts of mail and such-like  villainous defences; still the stroke fell with crushing force. Swerving  aside, the sword hit Pantasilea full in nose and mouth. Both she and  Luigi grovelled on the ground, while Bachiacca, with his breeches down  to heels, screamed out and ran away. Then I turned upon the others  boldly with my sword; and those valiant fellows, hearing a sudden  commotion in the tavern, thought there was an army coming of a hundred  men; and though they drew their swords with spirit, yet two horses which  had taken fright in the tumult cast them into such disorder that a  couple of the best riders were thrown, and the remainder took to flight.  I, seeing that the affair was turning out well, for me, ran as quickly  as I could, and came off with honour from the engagement, not wishing to  tempt fortune more than was my duty. During this hurly-burly, some of  the soldiers and captains wounded themselves with their own arms; and  Messer Benvegnato, the Popes chamberlain, was kicked and trampled by  his mule. One of the servants also, who had drawn his sword, fell down  together with his master, and wounded him badly in the hand. Maddened by  the pain, he swore louder than all the rest in his Perugian jargon,  crying out: By the body of God, I will take care that Benvegnato  teaches Benvenuto how to live. He afterwards commissioned one of the  captains who were with him (braver perhaps than the others, but with  less aplomb, as being but a youth) to seek me out. The fellow came to  visit me in the place of by retirement; that was the palace of a great  Neapolitan nobleman, who had become acquainted with me in my art, and  had besides taken a fancy to me because of my physical and mental  aptitude for fighting, to which my lord himself was personally well  inclined. So, then, finding myself made much of, and being precisely in  my element, I gave such answer to the captain as I think must have made  him earnestly repent of having come to look me up. After a few days,  when the wounds of Luigi, and the strumpet, and the rest were healing,  this great Neapolitan nobleman received overtures from Messer  Benvegnato; for the prelates anger had cooled, and he proposed to  ratify a peace between me and Luigi and the soldiers, who had personally  no quarrel with me, and only wished to make my acquaintance. Accordingly  my friend the nobleman replied that he would bring me where they chose  to appoint, and that he was very willing to effect a reconciliation. He  stipulated that no words should be bandied about on either side, seeing  that would be little to their credit; it was enough to go through the  form of drinking together and exchanging kisses; he for his part  undertook to do the talking, and promised to settle the matter to their  honour. This arrangement was carried out. On Thursday evening my  protector took me to the house of Messer Benvegnato, where all the  soldiers who had been present at that discomfiture were assembled, and  already seated at table. My nobleman was attended by thirty brave  fellows, all well armed; a circumstance which Messer Benvegnato had not  anticipated. When we came into the hall, he walking first, I following,  he speak to this effect: God save you, gentlemen; we have come to see  you, I and Benvenuto, whom I love like my own brother; and we are ready  to do whatever you propose. Messer Benvegnato, seeing the hall filled  with such a crowd of men, called out: It is only peace, and nothing  else, we ask of you. Accordingly he promised that the governor of Rome  and his catchpoles should give me no trouble. Then we made peace, and I  returned to my shop, where I could not stay an hour without that  Neapolitan nobleman either coming to see me or sending for me.    Meanwhile Luigi Pulci, having recovered from his wound, rode every day  upon the black horse which was so well trained to heel and bridle. One  day, among others, after it had rained a little, and he was making his  horse curvet just before Pantasileas door, he slipped and fell, with  the horse upon him. His right leg was broken short off in the thigh; and  after a few days he died there in Pantisileas lodgings, discharging"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4035"],[0,"Greek Studies: a Series of Essays (#16)"],[1,"eat that morsel [106] of  pomegranate, in the garden of Aidoneus.  The bitter wild mint was  once a girl, who for a moment had made her jealous, in Hades.    The episode of Triptolemus, to whom Demeter imparts the mysteries of  the plough, like the details of some sacred rite, that he may bear  them abroad to all people, embodies, in connexion with her, another  group of the circumstances of country life.  As with all the other  episodes of the story, there are here also local variations,  traditions of various favourites of the goddess at different places,  of whom grammarians can tell us, finally obscured behind the greater  fame of Triptolemus of Eleusis.  One might fancy, at first, that  Triptolemus was a quite Boeotian divinity, of the ploughshare.  Yet  we know that the thoughts of the Greeks concerning the culture of the  earth from which they came, were most often noble ones; and if we  examine carefully the works of ancient art which represent him, the  second thought will suggest itself, that there was nothing clumsy or  coarse about this patron of the plough--something, rather, of the  movement of delicate wind or fire, about him and his chariot.  And  this finer character is explained, if, as we are justified in doing,  we bring him into closest connexion with that episode, so full of a  strange mysticism, of the Nursing of Demophoon, in the Homeric hymn.  For, according to some traditions, none other [107] than Triptolemus  himself was the subject of that mysterious experiment, in which  Demeter laid the child nightly, in the red heat of the fire; and he  lives afterwards, not immortal indeed, not wholly divine, yet, as  Shakspere says, a \"nimble spirit,\" feeling little of the weight of  the material world about him--the element of winged fire in the clay.  The delicate, fresh, farm-lad we may still actually see sometimes,  like a graceful field-flower among the corn, becomes, in the sacred  legend of agriculture, a king's son; and then, the fire having  searched out from him the grosser elements on that famous night, all  compact now of spirit, a priest also, administering the gifts of  Demeter to all the earth.  Certainly, the extant works of art which  represent him, gems or vase-paintings, conform truly enough to this  ideal of a \"nimble spirit,\" though he wears the broad country hat,  which Hermes also wears, going swiftly, half on the airy, mercurial  wheels of his farm instrument, harrow or plough--half on wings of  serpents--the worm, symbolical of the soil, but winged, as sending up  the dust committed to it, after subtle firing, in colours and odours  of fruit and flowers.  It is an altogether sacred character, again,  that he assumes in another precious work, of the severer period of  Greek art, lately discovered at Eleusis, and now preserved in the  museum of Athens, a singularly refined bas-relief, in which he  stands, a firm and serious youth, between Demeter and [108]  Persephone, who places her hand as with some sacred influence, and  consecrating gesture, upon him.    But the house of the prudent countryman will be, of course, a place  of honest manners; and Demeter Thesmophoros is the guardian of  married life, the deity of the discretion of wives.  She is therefore  the founder of civilised order.  The peaceful homes of men, scattered  about the land, in their security--Demeter represents these fruits of  the earth also, not without a suggestion of the white cities, which  shine upon the hills above the waving fields of corn, seats of  justice and of true kingship.  She is also in a certain sense the  patron of travellers, having, in her long wanderings after  Persephone, recorded and handed down those omens, caught from little  things--the birds which crossed her path, the persons who met her on  the way, the words they said, the things they carried in their hands,  einodia symbola+--by noting which, men bring their journeys to a  successful end; so that the simple countryman may pass securely on  his way; and is led by signs from the goddess herself, when he  travels far to visit her, at Hermione or Eleusis.    So far the attributes of Demeter and Kore are similar.  In the  mythical conception, as in the religious acts connected with it, the  mother and the daughter are almost interchangeable; [109] they are  the two goddesses, the twin-named.  Gradually, the office of  Persephone is developed, defines itself; functions distinct from  those of Demeter are attributed to her.  Hitherto, always at the side  of Demeter and sharing her worship, she now appears detached from  her, going and coming, on her mysterious business.  A third part of  the year she abides in darkness; she comes up in the spring; and  every autumn, when the countryman sows his seed in the earth, she  descends thither again, and the world of the dead lies open, spring  and autumn, to let her in and out.  Persephone, then, is the summer-  time, and, in this sense, a daughter of the earth; but the summer as  bringing winter; the flowery splendour and consummated glory of the  year, as thereafter immediately beginning to draw near to its end, as  the first yellow leaf crosses it, in the first severer wind.  She is  the last day of spring, or the first day of autumn, in the threefold  division of the Greek year.  Her story is, indeed, but the story, in  an intenser form, of Adonis, of Hyacinth, of Adrastus--the king's  blooming son, fated, in the story of Herodotus, to be wounded to  death with an iron spear--of Linus, a fair child who is torn to  pieces by hounds every spring-time--of the English Sleeping Beauty.  From being the goddess of summer and the flowers, she becomes the  goddess of night and sleep and death, confuseable with Hecate, the  goddess of midnight [110] terrors--Korê arrêtos,+ the mother of the  Erinnyes, who appeared to Pindar, to warn him of his approaching  death, upbraiding him because he had made no hymn in her praise,  which swan's song he thereupon began, but finished with her.  She is  a twofold goddess, therefore, according as one or the other of these  two contrasted aspects of her nature is seized, respectively.  A  duality, an inherent opposition in the very conception of Persephone,  runs all through her story, and is part of her ghostly power.  There  is ever something in her of a divided or ambiguous identity: hence  the many euphemisms of later language concerning her.    The \"worship of sorrow,\" as Goethe called it, is sometimes supposed  to have had almost no place in the religion of the Greeks.  Their  religion has been represented as a religion of mere cheerfulness, the  worship by an untroubled, unreflecting humanity, conscious of no  deeper needs, of the embodiments of its own joyous activity.  It  helped to hide out of their sight those traces of decay and  weariness, of which the Greeks were constitutionally shy, to keep  them from peeping too curiously into certain shadowy places,  appropriate enough to the gloomy imagination of the middle age; and  it hardly proposed to itself to give consolation to people who, in  truth, were never \"sick or sorry.\"  But this familiar view of Greek  religion is based on a consideration of a part only of what is known  [111] concerning it, and really involves a misconception, akin to  that which underestimates the influence of the romantic spirit  generally, in Greek poetry and art; as if Greek art had dealt  exclusively with human nature in its sanity, suppressing all motives  of strangeness, all the beauty which is born of difficulty,  permitting nothing but an Olympian, though perhaps somewhat wearisome  calm.  In effect, such a conception of Greek art and poetry leaves in  the central expressions of Greek culture none but negative qualities;  and the legend of Demeter and Persephone, perhaps the most popular of  all Greek legends, is sufficient to show that the \"worship of sorrow\"  was not without its function in Greek religion; their legend is a  legend made by and for sorrowful, wistful, anxious people; while the  most important artistic monuments of that legend sufficiently prove  that the Romantic spirit was really at work in the minds of Greek  artists, extracting by a kind of subtle alchemy, a beauty, not  without the elements of tranquillity, of dignity and order, out of a  matter, at first sight painful and strange.    The student of origins, as French critics say, of the earliest stages  of art and poetry, must be content to follow faint traces; and in  what has been here said, much may seem to have been made of little,  with too much completion, by a general framework or setting, of what  after [112] all are but doubtful or fragmentary indications.  Yet  there is a certain cynicism too, in that over-positive temper, which  is so jealous of our catching any resemblance in the earlier world to  the thoughts that really occupy our own minds, and which, in its  estimate of the actual fragments of antiquity, is content to find no  seal of human intelligence upon them.  Slight indeed in themselves,  these fragmentary indications become suggestive of much, when viewed  in the light of such general evidence about the human imagination as  is afforded by the theory of \"comparative mythology,\" or what is  called the theory of \"animism.\"  Only, in the application of these  theories, the student of Greek religion must never forget that, after  all, it is with poetry, not with systematic theological belief or  dogma, that he has to do.  As regards this story of Demeter and  Persephone, what we actually possess is some actual fragments of  poetry, some actual fragments of sculpture; and with a curiosity,  justified by the direct aesthetic beauty of these fragments, we feel  our way backwards to that engaging picture of the poet-people, with  which the ingenuity of modern theory has filled the void in our  knowledge.  The abstract poet of that first period of mythology,  creating in this wholly impersonal, intensely spiritual way,"]]]
