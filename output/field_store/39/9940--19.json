He had  just finished when the wife of the proprietor of the resort came  up to the doorway.    \"The gentleman is wanted outside by my husband,\" she said in  broken French.    \"What does he want?\" asked Mr. Rover.    \"I can't say.  But he says please to step out for a moment.\"    Mr. Rover repeated the woman's words to the boys.  \"What do you  make of this?\" he asked.    \"I tell you something is wrong,\" declared Dick.  \"I have felt it  all along.\"    \"But what can be wrong, my lad?\"    \"If you go outside I'll go with you, Uncle Randolph.\"    \"Well, you can do that if you wish.\"    The pair arose and speedily slipped on the few garments which they  had taken off.  Then Dick pulled out his pistol.    \"Do you think it is as bad as that?\" asked Sam.    \"I don't know what to think.  But I'm going to take uncle's advice  and count every man an enemy until he proves himself a friend.\"    Soon Mr. Rover and Dick were ready to go out, and they did so,  followed by Aleck and preceded by the native woman.  As it was  dark the Rovers easily concealed their weapons in the bosoms of  their coats.    They walked past the bamboo addition and to the grove of trees  Aleck had mentioned.  There they found the Frenchman in  conversation with Captain Villaire.    \"You wish to see me?\" demanded Randolph Rover.    \"Very much,\" answered Villaire in French.  \"If You are Mr.  Randolph Rover, are you not?\"    \"I am.\"    \"And this is one of your nephews?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I believe you are hunting for the young man's father?\" went on  Villaire.    \"We are.  Do you know anything of him?\" demanded Randolph Rover  eagerly.    \"I do.  He sent me to you.\"    \"He sent you!\" cried Randolph Rover in amazement.  \"He is, then,  alive?\"    \"Yes; but a prisoner, and very sick.  He heard of your being in  Boma by accident through a native of King Susko's tribe who was  sent to the town for some supplies.  I heard the story and I have  been employed to lead you to him, and at once.\"    \"But--but this is marvelous,\" stammered Randolph Rover.  \"I must  say I do not understand it.\"    \"It is a very queer turn of affairs, I admit.  The other Mr. Rover  must explain to you when you meet.  He wishes you to come to him  alone.  It will not be safe for more.\"    As well as he was able Randolph Rover explained matters to Dick.  In the meantime, however, the youth had been looking around  sharply and had noted several forms gliding back and forth in the  gloom under the trees.  Dick was more suspicious than ever.    \"Uncle Randolph, I don't believe this man,\" he said briefly.  \"The  story he tells is too unnatural.\"    \"I think so myself, Dick; but still--\"    \"Why didn't this man come straight to the house to tell us this?\"    \"I'm sure I don't know.\"    \"Ask him.\"    Randolph Rover put the question to Captain Villaire.  The  Frenchman scowled deeply and shrugged his shoulders.  \"I had my  reason,\" he said briefly.  \"Will you come with me?\"    Before Randolph Rover could answer there came a shout from behind  several trees.    \"Look out fo' yourselves!\" came in Aleck's voice.  \"Dis am a  trap!\"    \"A trap!\" repeated Dick, when of a sudden a half dozen men rushed  at him and Randolph Rover and surrounded the pair.  In a twinkle,  before either could use his pistol, he was hurled flat and made a  prisoner.    \"Bind them, men,\" ordered Villaire sternly.  \"And bind them well,  so that escape is impossible.\"    \"Run for the house, Aleck!\" yelled, out Dick, before those on top  of him could choke him off.  \"Save Tom and Sam!    \"I will!\" came from the faithful black.  And off he sped at top  speed, with three or four of Captain Villaire's party after him.  Cujo also went to the house, bewildered by what was going on and  hardly knowing how to turn.    Randolph Rover fought desperately and so did Dick.  But the two  were no match for the six men who had attacked them, and ere they  knew it the Rovers were close prisoners, with their hands bound  behind them and each with a dirty gag of grass stuffed in his  mouth.    \"Now march, or you will be shot,\" came in bad English from one of  the Villaire party.  And as there seemed nothing better to do they  marched, wondering why they had been attacked and where they were  to be taken.  Their arms had been confiscated, so further  resistance was useless.  When Dick lagged behind he received a  cruel blow on the back which nearly sent him headlong.    A journey of several hours brought the party to a small clearing  overlooking the Congo at a point where the bank was fully fifty  feet above the surface of the stream.  Here, in years gone by, a  rough log hut had been built, which the African International  Association had once used as a fort during a war with the natives.  The log hut was in a state of decay, but still fit for use and  almost hidden from view by the dense growth of vines which covered  it.    The men who had brought Randolph Rover and Dick hither evidently  knew all about the hut, for they proceeded to make themselves at  home without delay.  Taking the Rovers into one of the apartments  of the dilapidated building they tied each to the logs of the  walls, one several yards from the other.    \"Now you must wait until Captain Villaire returns,\" said the  leader of the party in French.  \"He will be here before daylight.\"    \"But what does this mean?\" demanded Randolph Rover.    \"He will tell you what it means,\" grinned the brigand, and walked  away to another part of the hut, which was built in a long,  rambling fashion, and contained a dozen or more divisions.    \"We are in a pickle,\" remarked Dick dismally.  \"This is hunting  up father with a vengeance.\"    \"We won't despair yet, Dick.  But I would like to know what this  means.\"    \"It probably means robbery, for one thing, Uncle Randolph.  And it  may mean death.\"  And the youth, shuddered.    \"If I am not mistaken I saw some of these rascals hanging around  the hotel in Boma.\"    \"That is more than likely.  They have been watching their chance  to attack us ever since we left the town.\"    Slowly the hours wore away until morning dawned.  The positions of  both Dick and his uncle were most uncomfortable ones, and the  youth was ready to groan aloud at the strain put upon his  shoulders through having his arms tied behind him.    At last they heard footsteps approaching from the opposite end of  the rambling building.    \"Somebody at last!\" cried Dick.    He had scarcely spoken when Captain Villaire appeared, followed  by--Dan Baxter!          CHAPTER XVIII    A DEMAND OF IMPORTANCE      Dick could scarcely believe the evidence of his own eyesight as he  gazed at the former bully of Putnam Hall and the Frenchman who  stood beside him.    \"Baxter!  Is it possible!\" he gasped.  \"What brought you here?\"    \"Are you a prisoner, too?\" put in Randolph Rover.    \"A prisoner!\" laughed Baxter.  \"Well, that's a good one, I must  say.  No, I am not a prisoner.\"    \"And what brought you here?\" went on Mr. Rover.    \"Can't you imagine?\"    \"He is in with these rascals who have captured us,\" came quickly  from Dick.  \"This is how you repay our kindness, Baxter?\"    \"Your kindness?  Bah!  I want none of it.  Didn't I refuse your  offer, made just before you went away?\"    \"But you didn't refuse the first money we gave you, Baxter.\"    At this the bully bit his lip.  \"We won't talk about that, Dick  Rover.  Do you realize that you are absolutely in my power?  How  do you like it?\"    \"It was not you who captured us, Baxter.\"    \"Well, it amounts to the same thing, eh, Capitan Villaire?\" and  the big boy turned to the French brigand, who nodded.  \"We  collared you nicely.\"    \"What of Sam and Tom?\" asked Randolph Rover anxiously.    \"Ve will not speak of zem udders,\" broke in Captain Villaire.  \"Ve  vill speak apout you.\"    \"Did Baxter put up this plot against us? queried Dick.    \"To be sure I did,\" answered Baxter, who loved to brag just as  much as ever.    \"And before I let you go I'm going to make you pay up dearly for  all that I have suffered.  Captain Villaire, have you had them  searched?\" he asked, turning again to his companion.    \"Yees, Baxter, but za had not mooch monish wid zem.\"    \"How much?\"    \"Only about a hundred pounds.\"    \"Then they left it behind at Binoto's place,\" was the quick  answer.  \"Now if those others aren't captured--\"    \"Hush, ve vill not speak of zat,\" put in the brigand hastily.  \"Tell zeni what I haf tole you.\"    \"All right, I will.\"  Dan Baxter turned once more to the  prisoners.  \"Do you know why you were brought here?\"    \"To be robbed, I presume,\" answered Randolph Rover.    \"Or that and worse,\" said Dick significantly,    \"I reckon I have a right to all of your money, Dick Rover.\"    \"I don't see how you make that out, Baxter.\"    \"Years ago your father robbed mine out of the rights to a rich  gold mine in the United States.\"    \"That's your side of the story.  I claim, and so did my father,  that the mine was ours.\"    \"It's a falsehood.  The mine was discovered by my fattier, and if  everything had gone right he would have had the income from it.\"    \"This is ancient history, Baxter.  Come to business.  What do you  intend to do with us?\"    \"We intend to make money out of you,\" was the answer, given with a  rude laugh.    \"In what manner?\"    \"First you will have to answer a few questions.\"    \"Zat ees it,\" put in Captain Villaire.  \"How mooch morlish you  bring wid you from America?\"    \"We didn't bring much,\" answered Randolph Rover, who began to  smell a mouse.    \"How mooch?\"    \"About two hundred pounds.\"    \"Humph, a thousand dollars!\" sneered Baxter.  \"That won't do at  all.\"    \"You must haf brought more!\" cried the French brigand angrily.    \"Not much more.\"    \"You leave zat in Boma, wid ze bankers, eh?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But you haf von big lettair of credit, not so?\"    \"Yes, we have a letter of credit,\" answered Randolph Rover.  \"But  that won't "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5780"],[0,"The Rover Boys at School; Or, The Cadets of Putnam Hall (#16)"],[1," from this place.\"    \"You--you discharge me!\" cried the teacher in astonishment.    \"I do.  I have long been dissatisfied with your conduct toward my  pupils, and I am now satisfied that you are not worthy of the  position with which I entrusted you.\"    At this Josiah Crabtree's face fell, for he had hoped to keep his  place at Putnam Hall until his marriage to Mrs. Stanhope was  assured.  Now there was no telling when that marriage would occur,  and in the meantime it was not likely he could get another  position.    \"I think I ought to have more notice than this.\"    \"You deserve no notice--since you were about to marry on the  sly, so to speak, and, most likely, leave me when your contract  came to an end without allowing me time to make other  arrangements.\"    \"I would have given you at least two weeks time.\"    \"And I am giving you three weeks pay, which you do not deserve.  I  do not think we need to prolong the discussion,\" and Captain  Putnam turned away.    The departure of Josiah Crabtree was hailed with satisfaction by  all of the pupils excepting Dan Baxter.  Strange to say, a strong  friendship had sprung up between the bully and the hot-tempered  school teacher.  Baxter was the only one who shook hands when  Crabtree left.    \"I hope we meet again, Mr. Crabtree,\" he said.  \"I like you, even  if the others don't.\"    \"And I like you, Baxter,\" answered Josiah Crabtree.  \"I shall  remember you.\"    And Josiah Crabtree did remember the bully in a manner which was  strange in the extreme.          CHAPTER XV    DAN BAXTER'S MONEY      After the departure of Josiah Crabtree from Putnam Hall, George  Strong became the leading assistant, and another teacher named  Garmore took second place.    Garmore was a Yale man, and soon became as favorably known as  Strong, so the pupils had nothing more to find fault with, so far  as their instructors went.    As has been noted before, there were several baseball teams among  the boys.  As it grew too cold for baseball, these teams gave up  this sport, and a good number of the lads took up football.    In this sport, Sam, being a good runner, felt very much at home,  and soon he was at the head of one of the teams, playing center.  Tom was also on the team, playing quarterback.    Not far from Putnam Hall was another academy kept by a certain  gentleman named Pornell. The pupils at Pornell's were also great  football players, and one day they sent over a challenge that the  Putnams, as they were dubbed, should play them a match for the  championship of the township in which both seats of learning were  located.    The challenge was brought, by Peleg Snuggers, who had gone over to  Pornell's on an errand for Captain Putnam.    \"It's for you,\" said Snuggers, handing the communication to Sam.  The youthful captain of the eleven broke open the letter and read  it aloud:    \"PORNELL ACADEMY, November 18, 189-    \"To the Putnam Hall Football Team:  We hereby challenge you to a  game of football for the championship of the township of  Cedarville, the game to be played Thanksgiving afternoon next at  two o'clock, at our grounds or at your own, as you may elect.  We  would prefer to play on our grounds, as we have a  grandstand,  one-half of which will be reserved for your friends, if you  will come over.    \"PORNELL FOOTBALL TEAM,    \"Per Harry Ackerson, Capt. and Secy.\"    \"They certainly mean business,\" said Tom, who was in the crowd,  listening to the reading of the challenge.  \"I go in for accepting  it.\"    \"So do I,\" said Larry, who played halfback.    \"And I,\" put in Fred, who was on the right end.    The members of the football team were all at hand, and it did not  take long to find out each was in favor of the game, and then the  matter was laid before Captain Putnam.    \"Want to play football with Mr. Pornell's lads, eh?\" smiled the  captain.  \"All right, I know of no healthier sport, rightly  conducted.  You shall play them, and on their grounds if you wish.  But, mind you, no neglecting lessons for the sake of practicing  between now and Thanksgiving!\"    The pupils promised to neglect nothing, and went off with a  hurrah.    Soon Peleg Snuggers was on his way to the rival academy with the  following answer to the challenge:    \"PUTNAM HALL, November 19, 189-    \"Pornell Football Team: We hereby accept your challenge to play a  game of football for the championship of the township on  Thanksgiving afternoon next at two o'clock.  As you have a  grandstand we will play on your grounds.  In return for the use of  half of your stand on this occasion the senior class of our  academy will put up a silver cup as a trophy, said trophy to go to  the club winning the game, and to belong to that club which shall  during matches to be arranged in the future win the cup three  times.    \"THE PUTNAM HALL FOOTBALL TEAM,    \"Per Fred Harrison, Secy and Treas.\"    Dick had suggested giving the cup, and all of the senior class  \"chipped in\"  willingly, raising ten dollars, with which a very  neat trophy was secured through a pupil whose father was a  silversmith in New York.  I say all the senior class contributed.  I must correct this.  There was one exception, and that was Dan  Baxter.    \"I haven't got anything for you or your brothers,\" growled the  bully when Dick spoke of the matter before the class.  \"Let 'em  furnish their own silver cups if they want 'em.\"    \"All right, Baxter; I guess Sam and Tom will be just as well  satisfied if you don't chip in,\" had been Dick's ready answer.  \"I  only wanted to give everyone a chance to own an equal share in the  gift, if it was desired.\"    \"Our football team can't play for a sour apple, Dick Rover.  They'll be whipped out of their boots.\"    \"If I was a betting boy, I'd bet you a dollar on the result,\"  answered Dick coldly.    \"I'll bet you ten dollars we win!\" put in Fred Garrison  impulsively.    \"I'll cover that bet,\" sneered Baxter, and drew from his pocket a  roll of bills.    \"Gracious, Baxter, where did you get that wad?\" questioned several  in chorus, for the supply of pocket money among most of the pupils  was limited.    \"Never mind--I have it, and that's enough,\" answered Baxter, but  he lost no time in putting all of the money but the ten-dollar  bill away.    It was all Fred Garrison could do to scrape up an equal sum, and  even at that he had to borrow a dollar from Dick.  But he was  \"game,\" and the money went to another pupil, who became  stakeholder until the contest should be decided.    \"It's a shame!\" cried Sam, when he heard of the transaction.  \"To  bet against his own school!  I'm like Dick--I don't believe in  betting, and yet I am glad Fred took him up.  If it is in my  power, Baxter shall lose his wager.\"    Thanksgiving was but a week off, so the football team had to work  hard to get into proper condition.  Moreover, studies must not be  neglected, for Captain Putnam was strict, and would have canceled  the game had his cadets become unmindful of their school duties.  But the team got permission to get up an hour earlier than usual  every morning, and this time was spent in the hardest kind of  practice with the ball.    The report that Baxter had bet against his own school spread, and  the bully became more unpopular than ever.  But this did not daunt  him, and soon he had a dozen other bets on, aggregating fifty  dollars or more.    \"It's a mystery to me where he gets so much money,\" said Dick to  Captain Blossom one day, \"Is his father rich?\"    \"I can't tell you,\" answered the youthful commander of Company A.  \"Fact of the matter is nobody knows much about Baxter--not even  Mumps his chum.  Nobody ever comes to see him, and he seldom ever  gets any letters, yet he always has all the spending money he  wants.\"    \"Perhaps he's got a gold mine somewhere,\" laughed Dick.    \"I don't know about that, but I do know that there are days when  he hasn't a cent, and the next day he will have just such a roll  of bills as you saw him with day before yesterday--and the money  doesn't come to him through the mail either.\"    \"Perhaps Captain Putnam deals it out to him.\"    Captain Harry shook his head.  \"Not much!  The captain wouldn't  let him have more than five dollars at a time.  I've been through  the mill, and I know.\"    Here the matter was dropped, but Dick had good cause to remember  this conversation later on.    The distance from Putnam Hall to Pornell Academy was a mile and a  half, and it was arranged that the football team, Captain Putnam,  George Strong, and several others should ride to the latter place  in the Hall carriages while the others walked the distance.  Thanksgiving dawned bright and clear.  The morning was spent in  the Hall chapel, and dinner was served promptly at twelve.    \"Don't eat too much,\" cautioned Sam.  \"I want every player to be  wide awake today.\"    The start was signalized by a grand flourish of tin horns; and  away went the two carriages with the horses on a gallop, followed  by a large number of the cadets on foot, organized into their  regular companies, with Major Bart Conners at the head of the  battalion.  The boys were in their best uniforms, and certainly  presented an imposing appearance as they marched behind the music  of their drums and fifes.    When the grounds at Pornell Academy were reached, they were found  to be more than three quarters full, for the proprietor of the  place had opened up for the benefit of the public at large, and  many had come from Cedarville and the surrounding territory.  The  grandstand was already comfortably filled, many coming into the  part reserved for the Hall folks on tickets of invitation issued  by Sam and indorsed by Captain Putnam.    \"Here they come!\" yelled the boys of Pornell.  \"Three cheers for  Putnam Hall!\"    The cheers were given with a will; and, getting the football team  and the other cadets together, Putnam Hall gave a rousing cheer in  return for Pornell Academy.    Then the football teams"]]]
