[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39685"],[0,"Nooks and Corners of Old England (#16)"],[1," famous  abbey, the early fifteenth-century cloisters being, it is said, the most  perfect example in England. It has been a residence since the  Dissolution, when the estate was granted by Henry VIII. to Sir William  Sherrington, the daughter of whose brother Sir Henry married a Talbot of  Salwarpe, the ancestor of the present owner, C. H. Talbot, Esq., a  learned antiquary, by whose care and skill so many points of interest  have been brought to light. The cloisters, refectory, chapter-house,  sacristy, etc., are in an excellent state of preservation, and there  are some fine hooded fireplaces, and among the curiosities, a great  stone tank in which fish were kept; and the nuns' cauldron, something  after the style of Guy of Warwick's porridge-pot. The groined roof of  the cloister is remarkable, the bosses showing their original colouring,  nearly two hundred or more all being of different design. The sides  facing the road are flanked by an octagonal tower of singular beauty,  ornamented with balustrades, and a staircase turret crowned with a  cupola. This contains the muniment-room, in which is preserved Henry  III.'s Magna Charta, which belonged to the foundress, Ela, Countess of  Shrewsbury, the widow of William Longespee, the son of Henry II. and  Fair Rosamond. Dugdale tells us that the site \"Snaile's Mede\" was  pointed out to this good lady in a vision. An epitaph to the abbess Ela  may still be seen within the cloisters.    Sir John Talbot of Lacock was a staunch Royalist, and the first person  who received the Merry Monarch in his arms at Dover upon his landing in  1660. Both Sir John and his son Sharington Talbot figure as duellists in  the diaries of Pepys and Evelyn. The former was one of the six  combatants in that famous encounter at Barn Elms, where Buckingham  mortally wounded Francis Talbot, the eleventh Earl of Shrewsbury. Sir  John proved a better swordsman than his antagonist Captain William  Jenkins, for the latter was left dead upon the field. The Royal pardon  from Charles II. is still preserved in Lacock Abbey. The duel between  the younger Talbot and Captain Love at Glastonbury, in July 1685, is  mentioned by Evelyn. Both commanded a company of militia against  Monmouth at Sedgemoor, and after the battle an argument arose as to  which fought the best. The discussion grew heated, swords were drawn,  and Talbot was killed. He was the eldest and only surviving son of the  knight, and had he left issue, upon the death of the eleventh Earl of  Shrewsbury's son, the first and only duke, the Lacock Talbots would by  priority have become Earls of Shrewsbury.    [Illustration: BEWLEY COURT.]    Beyond the village, just before the road winds upwards towards Spye  Park, is Bewley Court, an interesting old farm, with trefoil windows and  Gothic entrance door of fine proportions. Its hall is intact, having its  wide open fireplace and open timber roof with carved beams. A reed-grown  canal, with one of those queer hand drawbridges, serves as the moat of  yore. Bewley by some is corrupted into \"Brewery,\" for close by there is  such an establishment, and the ancient name has become submerged. There  are said to have been four Courts originally belonging to Lacock Abbey,  but this is the only remaining one.    Each approach to Lacock is picturesque, but the most pleasing is from  the lane which runs up to Gastard and Corsham. This joins the Melksham  road by a charming old gabled and timbered cottage, not architecturally  remarkable, but pleasing in outline and colour. From the lane above,  this roadside cottage stands out against a background of wooded hill,  and when the sun is low it presents a picture which must have tempted  many an artist. On the way to Gastard and thence to Neston there are  many tumble-down old places which seem to be entirely out of touch with  the twentieth century. But at the highest point there is a startling  notice which might alarm a motorist should he lose his way up in these  narrow lanes. \"Beware of the trams\" is posted up in big letters! You  look around in astonishment, for silence reigns supreme; but by and bye  you come upon a stone quarry near the dilapidated entrance to what was  once probably a manor house, and a light falls upon the meaning of the  \"trams.\" An artistic projecting signboard not far off bears the  inscription:      \"Arise, get up the Season now    Drive up Brave Boys    God speed the Plough.\"    Up a narrow lane is a tiny chapel with a stone mullioned window cut down  into a semicircle at the top. A little stone sundial over the entrance  door, and the smallest burial-ground we have ever seen, are worth  notice for their quaintness. Farther to the west is Wormwood Farm, whose  ivy-clad gables give the house a more homely look than most hereabouts.  Higher up in a very bleak position is Chapel Plaster Hermitage, an older  building, whose little belfry surely cannot summon many worshippers. It  was a halting-place of pilgrims to Glastonbury, and in Georgian days of  lonely travellers, who were eased of their purses by a gentleman of the  road named Baxter, who afterwards was hung up as a warning on Claverton  Down. Near the wood, the resort of this highwayman, is Hazelbury House,  a sixteenth-century mansion, much reduced in size, whose formidable  battlemented garden walls are worthy of a fortress. It was once a seat  of the Strodes, whose arms are displayed on the lofty piers of the  entrance gate. On the other side of the Great Bath road is Cheney Court,  another gabled mansion which has been of importance in its day, and  within half a mile, Coles Farm, a smaller building, alas! fast falling  to decay. Its windows are broken and its panelled rooms are open to the  weather. We ploughed our way through garden, or what was once a garden,  waist-high with weeds, to a Tudor doorway whose door presumably was more  accustomed to be opened than closed. At the foot of the staircase was a  little wicket gate leading to the capacious cellars. Somebody had  scrawled above an ancient fireplace close by, a plea against wanton  mischief; but that was the only sign that anybody was interested in the  place. But we learned something from an intelligent farmer who was  picking apples in one of the surrounding orchards. It was very sad, he  said, but so it had remained for years. The owner was abroad, and though  various people had tried to buy it, there were legal difficulties which  prevented it. \"But why not find a tenant?\" we asked. \"That would surely  be better than allowing it to fall to pieces!\" He shook his head. \"'Tis  too far gone,\" he said, \"and there's no money to put it in repair.\" So  Coles Farm, situated in the midst of lovely hills and orchards, gives  the cold shoulder to many a willing tenant.    It is a precipitous climb from here to Colerne, which across the valley  looks old and inviting from the Bath road. But the place is sadly  disappointing, and Hunters' Hall, which once upon a time was used as an  inn and possessed some remarkably fine oak carvings, is now a shell, and  scarcely worth notice.    [Illustration: CORSHAM ALMSHOUSE.]    [Illustration: CORSHAM ALMSHOUSE.]    [Illustration: CORSHAM ALMSHOUSE.]    The village of Corsham, approached either from the north or south, is  equally picturesque. By the former there is a long row of sturdy Tudor  cottages with mullioned windows and deep-set doorways; by the latter,  the grey gables of the ancient Hungerford Hospital, and beyond the huge  piers of the entrance to Corsham Court. An inscription over the  almshouse porch and beneath the elaborate sculptured arms of the  Hungerfords, says that it was founded by Lady Margaret Hungerford,  daughter of William Halliday, alderman of London, and Susan, daughter of  Sir Henry Row, Knight, Lord Mayor of London. The chapel is on the  right-hand side, and contains the original Jacobean pulpit, seats, and  gallery. The pulpit is a two-decker, and the seat beneath a comfortable  armchair of large proportions with an ingenious folding footstool. The  screen is a fine piece of Jacobean carving, with pilasters and  semicircular arches of graceful design, with the Hungerford arms upon  two shields. There is a good oak staircase and a quaint exterior  corridor leading to the several dwellings, with trim little square  gardens allotted to each. Corsham Court has a stately and dignified  appearance. The second entrance gate has colossal piers, which quite  dwarf the others previously mentioned. Beyond are the stables, a  picturesque row of Elizabethan gables and pinnacles. The south front of  the house preserves its original character in the form of the letter E  with the arms and the crest of the builder, William Halliday, on  pinnacles over the gables, and seven bay-windows. The interior of the  mansion has been much modernised, but the picture collection contains  some of the choicest old masters. Some of Lord Methuen's ancestors by  Reynolds and Gainsborough are wonderfully vigorous. Here is Vandyck's  Charles I. on horseback, with which one is so familiar. How many  replicas must there be of this famous picture! Charles II. hangs  opposite his favourite son in one of the corridors--a fine portrait of  the handsome Monmouth. One of the most curious pictures is a group by  Sir Peter Lely, representing himself in mediaeval costume playing the  violoncello to his own family in light and airy dress. One would have  thought that he would have clad his wife and daughters more fully than  some of his famous beauties: on the contrary. The church, whose tower is  detached, has been restored from time to time, and looks by no means  lacking in funds. The carved parclose of stone and two altar-tombs to  the Hanhams are the chief points of interest. There is a simple  recumbent effigy of one of the Methuens, a little girl, which in its  natural sleeping pose is strangely pathetic, even to those who know  nothing of the story of her early death.    [Illustration"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/398"],[0,"The First Book of Adam and Eve (#16)"],[1,"angel is the one that brought you  incense; and that third angel, is the one who brought you myrrh when  you were on top of the mountain, and who carried you to the cave.    10 But as to the other angels our fellows, who bare you to the cave,  God has not sent them with us this time; for He said to us, 'You will  be enough'.\"    11 So when Adam heard these words he believed them, and said to these  angels, \"Speak the Word of God, that I may receive it.\"    12 And Satan said to him, \"Swear, and promise me that you will receive  it.\"    13 Then Adam said, \"I do not know how to swear and promise.\"    14 And Satan said to him, \"Hold out your hand, and put it inside my  hand.\"    15 Then Adam held out his hand, and put it into Satan's hand; when  Satan said to him, \"Say, now--So true as God is living, rational, and  speaking, who raised the stars in heaven, and established the dry  ground on the waters, and has created me out of the four elements*, and  out of the dust of the earth--I will not break my promise, nor renounce  my word.\"    16 And Adam swore thus.    17 Then Satan said to him, \"Look, it is now some time since you came  out of the garden, and you know neither wickedness nor evil.  But now  God says to you, to take Eve who came out of your side, and to marry  her so that she will bear you children, to comfort you, and to drive  from you trouble and sorrow; now this thing is not difficult, neither  is there any scandal in it to you.      * See the previous footnote in chapter XXXIV regarding the 'four  elements'.          Chapter LXXI - Adam is troubled by the thought of marrying Eve.    1 But when Adam heard these words from Satan, he sorrowed much, because  of his oath and of his promise, and said, \"Shall I commit adultery with  my flesh and my bones, and shall I sin against myself, for God to  destroy me, and to blot me out from off the face of the earth?    2 Since, when at first, I ate of the tree, He drove me out of the  garden into this strange land, and deprived me of my bright nature, and  brought death over me.  If, then, I should do this, He will cut off my  life from the earth, and He will cast me into hell, and will plague me  there a long time.    3 But God never spoke the words that you have said; and you are not  God's angels, and you weren't sent from Him.  But you are devils that  have come to me under the false appearance of angels.  Away from me;  you cursed of God!\"    4 Then those devils fled from before Adam.  And he and Eve got up, and  returned to the Cave of Treasures, and went into it.    5 Then Adam said to Eve, \"If you saw what I did, don't tell anyone; for  I sinned against God in swearing by His great name, and I have placed  my hand another time into that of Satan.\"  Eve, then, held her peace,  as Adam told her.    6 Then Adam got up, and spread his hands before God, beseeching and  entreating Him with tears, to forgive him what he had done.  And Adam  remained thus standing and praying forty days and forty nights.  He  neither ate nor drank until he dropped down on the ground from hunger  and thirst.    7 Then God sent His Word to Adam, who raised him up from where he lay,  and said to him, \"O Adam, why have you sworn by My name, and why have  you made agreement with Satan another time?\"    8 But Adam cried, and said, \"O God, forgive me, for I did this  unwittingly; believing they were God's angels.\"    9 And God forgave Adam, saying to him, \"Beware of Satan.\"    10 And He withdrew His Word from Adam.    11 Then Adam's heart was comforted; and he took Eve, and they went out  of the cave, to prepare some food for their bodies.    12 But from that day Adam struggled in his mind about his marrying Eve;  afraid that if he was to do it, God would be angry with him.    13 Then Adam and Eve went to the river of water, and sat on the bank,  as people do when they enjoy themselves.    14 But Satan was jealous of them; and planned to destroy them.          Chapter LXXII - Adam's heart is set on fire.  Satan appears as  beautiful maidens.    1 Then Satan, and ten from his hosts, transformed themselves into  maidens, unlike any others in the whole world for grace.    2 They came up out of the river in presence of Adam and Eve, and they  said among themselves, \"Come, we will look at the faces of Adam and  Eve, who are of the men on earth.  How beautiful they are, and how  different is their look from our own faces.\"  Then they came to Adam  and Eve, and greeted them; and stood wondering at them.    3 Adam and Eve looked at them also, and wondered at their beauty, and  said, \"Is there, then, under us, another world, with such beautiful  creatures as these in it?\"    4 And those maidens said to Adam and Eve, \"Yes, indeed, we are an  abundant creation.\"    5 Then Adam said to them, \"But how do you multiply?\"    6 And they answered him, \"We have husbands who have married us, and we  bear them children, who grow up, and who in their turn marry and are  married, and also bear children; and thus we increase.  And if so be, O  Adam, you will not believe us, we will show you our husbands and our  children.\"    7 Then they shouted over the river as if to call their husbands and  their children, who came up from the river, men and children; and every  man came to his wife, his children being with him.    8 But when Adam and Eve saw them, they stood dumb, and wondered at them.    9 Then they said to Adam and Eve, \"See all our husbands and our  children?  You should marry Eve, as we have married our husbands, so  that you will have children as we have.\" This was a device of Satan to  deceive Adam.    10 Satan also thought within himself, \"God at first commanded Adam  concerning the fruit of the tree, saying to him, 'Eat not of it; else  of death you shall die.'  But Adam ate of it, and yet God did not kill  him; He only decreed on him death, and plagues and trials, until the  day he shall come out of his body.    11 Now, then, if I deceive him to do this thing, and to marry Eve  without God's permission, God will kill him then.\"    12 Therefore Satan worked this apparition before Adam and Eve; because  he sought to kill him, and to make him disappear from off the face of  the earth.    13 Meanwhile the fire of sin came over Adam, and he thought of  committing sin.  But he restrained himself, fearing that if he followed  this advice of Satan, God would put him to death.    14 Then Adam and Eve got up, and prayed to God, while Satan and his  hosts went down into the river, in presence of Adam and Eve; to let  them see that they were going back to their own world.    15 Then Adam and Eve went back to the Cave of Treasures, as they  usually did; about evening time.    16 And they both got up and prayed to God that night.  Adam remained  standing in prayer, yet not knowing how to pray, by reason of the  thoughts in his heart regarding his marrying Eve; and he continued so  until morning.    17 And when light came up, Adam said to Eve, \"Get up, let us go below  the mountain, where they brought us gold, and let us ask the Lord  concerning this matter.\"    18 Then Eve said, \"What is that matter, O Adam?\"    19 And he answered her, \"That I may request the Lord to inform me about  marrying you; for I will not do it without His permission or else He  will make us perish, you and me.  For those devils have set my heart on  fire, with thoughts of what they showed us, in their sinful apparitions.    20 Then Eve said to Adam, \"Why need we go below the mountain?  Let us  rather stand up and pray in our cave to God, to let us know whether  this counsel is good or not.\"    21 Then Adam rose up in prayer and said, \"O God, you know that we  transgressed against you, and from the moment we transgressed, we were  stripped of our bright nature; and our body became brutish, requiring  food and drink; and with animal desires.    22 Command us, O God, not to give way to them without Your permission,  for fear that You will turn us into nothing.  Because if you do not  give us permission, we shall be overpowered, and follow that advice of  Satan; and You will again make us perish.    23 If not, then take our souls from us; let us be rid of this animal  lust.  And if You give us no order respecting this thing, then sever  Eve from me, and me from her; and place us each far away from the other.    24 Then again, O God, if You separate us from each other, the devils  will deceive us with their apparitions that resemble us, and destroy  our hearts, and defile our thoughts towards each other.  Yet if it is  not each of us towards the other, it will, at all events, be through  their appearance when the devils come to us in our likeness.\" Here Adam  ended his prayer.          Chapter LXXIII - The marriage of Adam and Eve.    1 Then God considered the words of Adam that they were true, and that  he could long await His order, respecting the counsel of Satan.    2 And God approved Adam in what he had thought concerning this, and in  the prayer he had offered in His presence; and the Word of God came to  Adam and said to him, \"O Adam, if only you had had this caution at  first, before you came out of the garden into this land!\"    3 After that, God sent His angel who had brought gold, and the angel  who had brought incense, and the angel who had brought myrrh to Adam,  that they should inform him respecting his marriage to Eve.    4 Then those angels said to Adam, \"Take the gold and give it to Eve as  a wedding gift, and promise to marry her; then give her some incense  and myrrh as a present; and be you, you and she, one flesh.\"    5 Adam obeyed the angels, and took the gold and put it into Eve's bosom  in her garment; and promised to marry her with his hand.    6 Then the angels commanded Adam and Eve to get up and pray forty days  and forty nights; when that was done, then Adam was to have sexual  intercourse with his wife; for then this would be an act pure and  undefiled; so that he would have children who would multiply,"]]]
