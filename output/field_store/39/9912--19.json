And yet how horrid it is going to be  after this!  I don't feel as if I could ever bear to see Mrs.  Florence again.  I must write.    \"But then,\" her thoughts flowed on, \"home wouldn't seem like home if  we went away from school in disgrace, and knew that everybody here  was believing such things.  Suppose, instead, I were to write to  papa to come on and make things straight.  He'd find out the truth,  and force Mrs. Florence to see it.  It would be very expensive,  though; and I know he oughtn't to leave home again so soon. Oh,  dear!  How hard it is to know what to do!\"    \"What would Cousin Helen say?\" she continued, going in imagination  to the sofa-side of the dear friend who was to her like a second  conscience.  She shut her eyes and invented a long talk,--her  questions, Cousin Helen's replies.  But, as everybody knows, it is  impossible to play croquet by yourself and be strictly impartial to  all the four balls.  Katy found that she was making Cousin Helen  play (that is, answer) as she herself wished, and not, as something  whispered, she would answer were she really there.    \"It is just the 'Little Scholar' over again,\" she said, half aloud,  \"I can't see.  I don't know how to act.\"  She remembered the dream  she once had, of a great beautiful Face and a helping hand.  \"And  it was real,\" she murmured, \"and just as real, and just as near,  now as then.\"    The result of this long meditation was that, when Clover woke up,  she found Katy leaning over, ready to kiss her for good morning,  and looking bright and determined.    \"Clovy,\" she said, \"I've been thinking; and I'm not going to write  to papa about this affair at all!\"    \"Aren't you?  Why not?\" asked Clover, puzzled.    \"Because it would worry him, and be of no use.  He would come on and  take us right away, I'm sure; but Mrs. Florence and all the teachers,  and a great many of the girls, would always believe that this horrid,  ridiculous story is true.  I can't bear to have them.  Let's stay,  instead, and convince them that it isn't.  I think we can.\"    \"I would a great deal rather go home,\" said Clover.  \"It won't ever  be nice here again.  We shall have this dark room, and Miss Jane will  be  more unkind than ever, and the girls will think you wrote that  note, and Lilly Page will say hateful things!\"  She buttoned her  boots with a vindictive air.    \"Never mind,\" said Katy, trying to feel brave.  \"I don't suppose it  will be pleasant, but I'm pretty sure it's right.  And Rosy and all  the girls we really care for know how it is.\"    \"I can't bear it,\" sighed Clover, with tears in her eyes.  \"It is so  cruel that they should say such things about you.\"    \"I mean that they shall say something quite different before we go  away,\" replied Katy, stroking her hair.  \"Cousin Helen would tell  us to stay, I'm pretty sure.  I was thinking about her just now,  and I seemed to hear her voice in the air, saying over and over,  'Live it down!  Live it down!  Live it down!'\"  She half sang this,  and took two or three dancing steps across the room.    \"What a girl you are!\" said Clover, consoled by seeing Katy look  so bright.    Mrs. Florence was surprised that morning, as she sat in her room, by  the appearance of Katy.  She looked pale, but perfectly quiet and  gentle.    \"Mrs. Florence,\" she said, \"I've come to say that I shall not write  to my father to take us away, as I told you I should.\"    Mrs. Florence bowed stiffly, by way of answer.    \"Not,\" went on Katy, with a little flash in her eyes, \"that he would  hesitate, or doubt my word one moment, if I did.  But he wished us  to stay here a year, and I don't want to disappoint him.  I'd rather  stay.  And, Mrs. Florence, I'm sorry I was angry, and felt that you  were unjust.\"    \"And to-day you own that I was not?\"    \"Oh, no!\" replied Katy, \"I can't do that.  You _were_ unjust, because  neither Clover nor I wrote that note.  We wouldn't do such a horrid  thing for the world, and I hope some day you will believe us.  But I  oughtn't to have spoken so.\"    Katy's face and voice were so truthful as she said this, that Mrs.  Florence was almost shaken in her opinion.    \"We will say no more about the matter,\" she remarked, in a kinder  tone.  \"If your conduct is perfectly correct in future, it will go  far to make this forgotten.\"    Few things are more aggravating than to be forgiven when one has done  no wrong.  Katy felt this as she walked away from Mrs. Florence's  room.  But she would not let herself grow angry again.  \"Live it  down!\" she whispered, as she went into the school-room.    She and Clover had a good deal to endure for the next two or three  weeks.  They missed their old room with its sunny window and pleasant  outlook.  They missed Rose, who, down at the far end of Quaker Row,  could not drop in half so often as had been her custom.  Miss Jane  was specially grim and sharp; and some of the upstairs girls, who  resented Katy's plain speaking, and the formation of a society against  flirting, improved the chance to be provoking.  Lilly Page was one of  these.  She didn't really believe Katy guilty, but she liked to tease  her by pretending to believe it.    \"Only to think of the President of the Saintly Stuck-Up Society being  caught like this!\"  she remarked, maliciously.  \"What are our great  reformers coming to?  Now if it had been a sinner like me, no one  would be surprised!\"    All this naturally was vexatious.  Even sunny Clover shed many tears  in private over her mortifications.  But the girls bore their trouble  bravely, and never said one syllable about the matter in the letters  home.  There were consolations, too, mixed with the annoyances.  Rose  Red clung to her two friends closely, and loyally fought their battles.  The S. S. U. C. to a girl rallied round its chief.  After that sad  Saturday the meetings were resumed with as much spirit as ever.  Katy's  steadiness and uniform politeness and sweet temper impressed  even those who would have been glad to believe a tale against her,  and in short time the affair ceased to be a subject for discussion,--  was almost forgotten, in fact, except for a sore spot in Katy's heart,  and one page in Rose Red's album, upon which, under the date of that  fatal day, were written these words, headed by an appalling skull  and cross-bones in pen-and-ink:--                                        \"N. B.--Pay Miss Jane off.\"          CHAPTER VIII.  CHANGES.      \"Clover, where's Clover?\" cried Rose Red, popping her head into the  schoolroom, where Katy sat writing her composition.  \"Oh, Katy! there  you are.  I want you too.  Come down to my room right away.  I've such  a thing to tell you!\"    \"What is it?\"  Tell me too!\" said Bella Arkwright.  Bella was a  veritable \"little pitcher,\" of the kind mentioned in the Proverb,  and had an insatiable curiosity to know every thing that other  people knew.    \"Tell you, Miss?  I should really like to know why!\" replied Rose,  who was not at all fond of Bella.    \"You're real mean, and real unkind,\" whined Bella.  \"You think you're  a great grown-up lady, and can have secrets.  But you ain't!  You're  a little girl too,--most as little as me.  So there!\"    Rose made a face at her, and a sort of growling rush, which had the  effect of sending Bella screaming down the hall.  Then, returning to  the school-room,--    \"Do come, Katy,\" she said: \"find Clover, and hurry!  Really and truly  I want you.  I feel as if I should burst if I don't tell somebody  right away what I've found out.\"    Katy began to be curious.  She went in pursuit of Clover, who was  practising in one of the recitation-rooms, and the three girls ran  together down Quaker Row.    \"Now,\" said Rose, locking the door, and pushing forward a chair for  Katy and another for Clover, \"swear that you won't tell, for this is  a real secret,--the greatest secret that ever was, and Mrs. Florence  would flay me alive if she knew that I knew!\"  She paused to enjoy  the effect of her words, and suddenly began to snuff the air in a  peculiar manner.    \"Girls,\" she said, solemnly, \"that little wretch of a Bella is in this  room.  I am sure of it.\"    \"What makes you think so?\" cried the others supervised.    \"I smell that dreadful pomatum that she puts on her hair!  Don't you  notice it?  She's hidden somewhere.\"  Rose looked sharply about for  a minute, then made a pounce, and from under the bed dragged a small  kicking heap.  It was the guilty Bella.    \"What were you doing there, you bad child?\" demanded Rose, seizing the  kicking feet and holding them fast.    \"I don't care,\" blubbered Bella, \"you wouldn't tell me your secret.  You're a real horrid girl, Rose Red.  I don't love you a bit.\"    \"Your affection is not a thing which I particularly pine for,\" retorted  Rose, seating herself, and holding the culprit before her by the ends  of her short pig-tails.  \"I don't want little girls who peep and hide  to love me.  I'd rather they wouldn't.  Now listen.  Do you know what  I shall do if you ever come again into my room without leave.  First,  I shall cut off your hair, pomatum and all, with my penknife,\"--Bella  screamed,--\"and then I'll turn myself into a bear--a great brown bear  --and eat you up.\"  Rose pronounced this threat with tremendous energy,  and accompanied it with a snarl which showed all her teeth.  Bella  roared with fright, twitched away her pig-tails, unlocked the door and  fled, Rose not pursuing, but sitting comfortably in her chair and  growling at intervals, till her victim was out of hearing.  Then she  rose and bolted the door again.    \"How lucky that the imp is so fond of that smelly pomatum!\" she  remarked: \"one always knows where to look for her.  It's as good as  a bell round her neck!  Now, for the secret.  You promise not to tell?  Well, then, Mrs. Florence is going away week after next, and, what's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51547"],[0,"The Story of the Airship (Non-rigid) (#16)"],[1,"were converted to other  aeronautic uses; the two-ship dock at Chicago and the one at New York  were torn down and moved to Akron to provide additional space for ship  assembly.    And so the fact that the company had maintained an airship fleet for a  number of years had the result that in emergency when the Navy needed  ships and men to fly them, Goodyear was ready. All of which was not  foreseen when Mrs. Litchfield pulled a cord to release a flock of  pigeons and christen the pioneer ship Pilgrim, at a pasture-airport  outside Akron in 1925.                                         CHAPTER IX                         Vulnerability of Airships          [Illustration: Airship and escort warship]    Mention airships and most people will immediately raise the question of  vulnerability.    Large, slow moving, a tempting target, airships could be shot out of the  sky by ship or shore guns, or by hostile airplane fire, it is argued,  almost as easily as a dinner guest touching his cigaret to a toy  balloon.    And this is probably true, with reservations, if enemy ships or  anti-aircraft batteries or planes were around. But the airship,  non-rigid, has no more business in such areas than a British airplane  carrier would have to drop anchor in Hamburg harbor.    It was because of the imminence of attack from sea or shore or air that  neither England nor Germany used airships in the present war,  particularly since they would have to use the inflammable hydrogen gas.  It was because such attack on American airships from any of these three  sources was much less likely--and that we have helium gas, which does  not burn--that this country is using them.    Their chief field of operations is not off the enemy's coasts but our  own, along that broad ribbon of waters used by our coastwise shipping,  an area roughly marked in the Atlantic by the 100 fathom curve, the  favorite fishing grounds of enemy submarines. Thousands of miles of blue  water, not the narrow lanes of the North Sea or British Channel are  between them and the shore guns of an enemy.    An enemy fleet, though likelihood of this seems remote, might penetrate  those coast waters in attempted invasion, attack the blimps with  anti-aircraft fire. But such an enemy, arriving in force, would have  either to knock out our Atlantic fleet, or slip past it in surprise  attempt. In the remote later contingency, the information relayed back  by airship radio that the enemy was moving in would be worth losing  airships or any other craft, to get.    The third hypothesis, attack by airplane, is also conceivable. But if  long-ranging enemy planes were able to get that close to our shores  they'd have more important business in hand than wasting time and powder  on a helium bubble bobbing in the air, 10,000 feet below--which in any  event would already have radioed the news ashore.    In the fairly remote contingency that the airplane did choose to attack  the blimp, it would find the position of that moving target, flying at  an indeterminate distance below, much more difficult to calculate than a  fixed target ashore, no easy thing to drop bombs on.    If it swung down close, it might riddle the bag with machine gun bullets  but without necessarily sinking it--as witness the case of Trotter's  ship in Oklahoma leaking gas for 72 hours from 14 gaping holes and still  able to fly 400 miles for repairs. The plane would have almost to cut  the blimp in two with a spray of bullets to destroy it--if it chose to  use its precious far-borne ammunition in such fashion--and would find it  better to attack from below, on the chance of a lucky hit into the  airship structure or controls, or one which disabled its crew. But in  that event the airship, also armed, shooting it out from its more stable  gun platform above would have as good a chance as the plane.    The airship is vulnerable--as are all other military craft--but used as  the Navy proposes to use airships, it may be said to have an acceptable  degree of vulnerability, in view of its potential usefulness in its  special field--defense against submarine attack on convoys or coastwise  shipping.    The airship's advantages have been pointed out, but may be repeated.  These grow out of its speed range, from zero to a maximum of 65 knots or  so. Its slow speed, as compared to the airplane has the compensation  that it does not have to circle around to maintain altitude, can keep  any suspect object under continuous observation. Its high speed enables  it to reach a given point much sooner than the fastest surface scout.        [Illustration: Barrage balloons--spiders who spin out webs of steel      as they ascend--but these spiders are out to catch fliers, not      flies, enemy fliers who threaten our democracy.]        [Illustration: Modern armies towing a few of these pocket sized      barrage balloons along, might not be too much concerned over attacks      by strafing airplanes.]        [Illustration: This Strata Sentinel will fly at 15,000 feet, twice      the height of other barrage balloons. By that time the lobes will be      completely filled out by expanding pressure of the lifting gas.]        [Illustration: This airship, silhouetted against the afternoon sun      might be pacing a peaceful cruiser race through the surf off Long      Beach, on the Southern California coast. Or it might be leading      units of the mosquito fleet to sea off Cape Cod, to hold an enemy      U-boat in check till ships of heavier armament could arrive.]        [Illustration: Helium-inflated, fast, long ranged, the modern K-type      Navy patrol ship is a far cry from the primitive airships of World      War I. They are armed with bombs and machine guns.]        [Illustration: In brilliant sunshine, or overcast, in fog or rain or      snow, the blimps take off from their bases day after day, on guard      against any enemy who may invade the coastal waters. A faint smoke      screen, miles distant over the endless waters, may turn out to be a      peaceful merchantman--or a vessel with grimmer purpose, seeking the      advantage of surprise attack.]        [Illustration: Airship over cargo ship]    The detection of a submarine even on the surface is largely a matter of  looking in the right direction at the right time. The open windows on  all sides of the airship, without obstruction by wings give it special  value in this field.    A submarine submerged is still harder to find as its tell-tale feather  is not easy to spot from a speeding plane or from the crow's nest of a  surface craft.    A non-rigid airship throttling down to the speed of its prey, and having  the altitude of the airplane, has a much better chance of sighting the  submarine, before it can launch its torpedoes.    Taking off in fog, flying in low visibility, compelled to fly close to  the water, these factors do not worry the airship or handicap its  usefulness overmuch, and might under given conditions prove extremely  useful.    The airship appears to have some advantage too in the length of time it  may remain on station, ranging from 30 hours at high speed to  undetermined days at low. Indeed its endurance is not so much a matter  of fuel capacity as of the ability of crews to stand long watches  without relief.    There might be emergencies where airship scouts were wanted on  continuous duty over a considerable period. Commander Roands'  experiments point out interesting possibilities in this respect, through  the transfer of fuel and supplies from a surface ship, and the taking on  of fresh crews.    This generally was the case men saw for the airship up to 1941, as  having potential usefulness, in the event of war, against attack by sea.    Then came Pearl Harbor, and America's entrance into a new war. German  U-boats, larger, faster, more deadly, moved swiftly in to attack, as if  waiting for the signal. The Japs made reconnaissance raids along the  West Coast.    \"Wolf packs\" of submarines in new under-water tactics stalked convoys,  picked off stragglers. More than 600 coast-wise ships, merchantmen from  the Caribbean and South America, and tankers from the Gulf, were sunk in  the first year of war. The loss of tankers brought serious complications  ashore, the rationing of gas along the eastern seaboard to conserve  supply for military purposes. Despite a quickly expanding program of  ship construction merchantmen were being sunk faster than they could be  built.    The Navy's sea-frontier defense moved to meet the attack. Non-rigid  airships were assigned a place in that program, wherever they could be  utilized and with what ships were on hand, and new airship construction  was rushed.    Under authorization from Congress, a program of airship and base  construction, together with helium procurement, was accelerated, and by  the end of the year, stations were in commission or being built at key  points along both coasts and the Gulf of Mexico.    Akron expanded its facilities many fold for the building of new  airships, which were flown to the various bases with increasing  frequency during the year. Large classes of officers, aviation cadets  and enlisted men went into intensified training at Lakehurst and Moffett  Field, preparing themselves to man the ships as fast as they were  delivered.    The blimps which have been available to the sea-frontier forces have  rendered valuable service in patrol and escort missions. Their exact  record of performance, including number of submarine sinkings, obviously  cannot now be published.    On sighting a submarine, or finding indication of its presence, the  tactical doctrine might call either for attack, or to stand by,  summoning airplanes and surface craft in for the kill, keeping the enemy  under unsuspected surveillance the while, and saving the blimp's own  depth bombs for another action.    The airship is capable of carrying on patrol and escort missions day  after day under a wide range of"]]]
