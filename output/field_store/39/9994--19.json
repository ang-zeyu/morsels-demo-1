The second year the contractor bought only Canadian cattle.  The difference in the meat is very great, the one being hard and full of  thread-like sinews, the other juicy and tender.    The evening before the September mail went out, I was sitting up late  writing letters, when Mrs. C---- in a frightened tone called me to  \"_listen to that queer noise_\"--a crunching, rustling sound from the  rocks west of the house, just as if some heavy animal was making its way  through the underbrush and dry moss. Rumours of the vicinity of bears had  reached us that day, and we jumped at once to the conclusion that Bruin  was upon us. What was to be done? We were quite certain the poor calf,  tethered to a stump on the grass plot, would fall an easy victim. Then  all the windows were wide open downstairs, and we did not think it  probable Bruin would respect the mosquito-netting sufficiently for us to  depend upon it as a defence. Mr. C---- and the men were away down the line,  and the doctor, who had come in that day, was enjoying a slumber, from  which it seemed cruel to disturb him after his hard day's tramp. However,  as the noise increased, and seemed nearer every moment, it had to be  done. Did you ever try to wake a very sound sleeper, making apparently  noise enough to awaken the dead, and when about to give it up in despair  have him answer, after your last effort, in a mild, good-naturedly  aggravating tone, which impresses you with the belief that he has only  closed his eyes for a moment's meditation? Just so did our excellent  Esculapius. Imploring him to get up, and telling him that the bears were  upon us, I rushed to obey Mrs. C----, who screamed to me to shut all the  windows. While I was scrambling on to the kitchen table to reach the  last, the doctor appeared, very much _en déshabille_, with his hair  rumpled and a general air of incompleteness about him, demanding the  whereabouts of the bear; and at the same moment Mrs. C----, in her  night-dress, leant over the banisters above, listening with all her ears  for the answer. The absurdity of the whole scene so struck me that I could  scarcely refrain from laughing outright. Sallying forth, armed with a big  stick, the valiant doctor drove out from behind the wood-pile on the  rock--a large, half-starved dog, who was trying to worry a meal off the  dried hide of a defunct cow!    The night was brilliant; bright moonlight lay like a long string of  diamonds on the bosom of the lake; a blue, cloudless sky spread over our  heads; but far away to the south a great bank of murky clouds, lined with  silver, was momentarily rent by fierce flashes of forked lightning,  followed by the muttering of distant thunder.    In November a very sad accident occurred, by which Mr. C---- lost one of  his staff. The weather was cold and disagreeable, just the few transition  days between the beautiful Indian summer and clear Canadian winter. Until  then the thermometer had registered 70 degrees in the shade at noon, but  the change had come suddenly, as it always does in Manitoba, and in a  few days the smaller lakes had frozen over wholly, but the larger ones only  partially. The mail had been delayed in consequence of there being no  means of passage either by land or water. On the 10th Mr. W---- and Mr.  K---- dined at Inver, and the former resisted all persuasions to remain  until the morning, being anxious to reach his station, Ingolf, next day  in time to intercept the expected mail-carrier, and feeling sure he could  reach the intermediate station, Kalmar, before dark. He left about three  o'clock. What seeming trifles sometimes make all the difference between  life and death! That day dinner was half an hour late, an unusual thing  in our punctual house, and if he had only had that half-hour more of  daylight, his fate would have been changed. He crossed the three first  lakes in safety upon the ice, and naturally thought that he should find  the fourth equally firm, forgetting that the sun had been, shining on the  north side with a heat doubled by the high, rocky shore. He attempted to  cross, but, alas, never reached the other side.    The next evening (Saturday), not hearing him work the telegraph, Mr. K----,  who had been detained at Inver, asked Kalmar when Mr. W---- left, and  the answer that he had not seen him told us the sad news at once. Next  morning at daybreak a party went in search of the unfortunate man, and  found his body not thirty feet from the shore. His hat, profile (or map),  and the long pole carried by all who have to cross unsound ice, were  floating near. His large boots, which were so strapped round his waist  that it was impossible to get them off, had kept him down. The lake (Red  Pine) is small but deep, and he had died alone in the forest, with only  the giant rocks around him to echo back his dying cries. While I write,  memory recalls his laughing air, when telling me that morning how he had  tried to cross the narrows of our lake, but had desisted, fearing a  ducking on such a cold day; and I, pointing to his immense boots, said  they were scarcely fit to wear when running such risks. How little I  dreamt what harm they were doomed to do! His great brown eyes, with the  sad, far-away look in them, as if, unknown to himself, they saw into the  future; his graceful, manly figure, as he sprang up the hill behind the  house, and his cheery \"Good-bye, till I see you again,\" can never be  forgotten.    When the winter roads became passable, they took him into Winnipeg, and  laid him in the Roman Catholic cemetery there--alone, away from all he  loved, without a kindly hand to tend his last resting-place. His death  cast a gloom over all our party. Though grieving for him and missing him  continually, we could never realize that he was really dead. And the  knowledge that it was so even to us made our hearts fill with sympathy  for one far away, to whom the sad tidings would have more than the  bitterness of death.    Our great excitement after winter had set in in earnest was the arrival  of the first dog-train. Hearing the shrill \"Marsh-sha\" (Marcha) of the  driver, we all rushed to the window to see the pretty beasts, in their  gaily-worked saddle-cloths and merry bells, come down the hill; then,  when a halt was called, to watch them sit down on their haunches and look  proudly about them, as if quite aware of the interest they excited. The  taboggans they drew were not heavily laden, and as far as I can judge  from my limited experience, the dogs are invariably kindly treated by  their drivers; all looked well fed and in good condition. During the  summer, and sometimes in the winter, when the poor Indians themselves are  more than half-starved, it is little wonder that the dogs fare as badly  as their masters, and look lean and miserable.    The winter of 1878 was mild and open, more so than had been known in the  North-west for thirty years. The snow had vanished almost completely from  the portages, and water covered the ice on many of the lakes. When, at  Christmas, the staff accepted Mrs. C----'s invitation to spend the day at  Inver, the question was whether they would come with dogs or canoes?  Neither, however, were practicable, and they had to walk--some of them  eighteen miles.    We amused ourselves icing the cake, inventing devices, with the aid of  scraps of telegraph wire, as supports for the upper decorations,  decorating the house with cedar and balsam wreaths, and providing as good  a dinner as it was possible to obtain in the woods. With the exception of  having nothing for our guests to drink, we succeeded tolerably well.  Being within the limits of prohibitory laws, it was necessary to ask the  Lieutenant-governor of Manitoba for an especial \"permit\" to have wine  sent out; and we were answered that, \"if the men had to do without  whisky, the gentlemen might do without wine.\" So we had to content  ourselves with half a glass of sherry each, the remains of some smuggled  out with our luggage in the spring.    We soon had proof that the men rebelled against the prohibitory law. The  presence of whisky being suspected in a neighbouring camp, a constable  who had been but recently appointed, and was anxious to show his zeal,  never rested until he had discovered the smuggler and brought him to  justice; the clause that the informer was entitled to half the fine of  fifty dollars not diminishing his ardour.    To a lawyer the proceedings would have been amusing, for all parties  concerned were novices in their respective _rôles_. The justice of  the peace, with a great idea of his own importance, the majesty of the  law, and the necessity for carrying it out to the letter, had obtained  several manuals for the guidance of county justices of the peace and  stipendiary magistrates, over the technicalities of which he spent many a  sleepless hour. No sooner had he mastered the drift of one act, than the  next repealed so many of its clauses that the poor man became hopelessly  bewildered. Handcuffs there were none, neither was there a lock-up, and  the constable spent his time in keeping guard over the prisoner, being  paid two dollars a day for the service. The latter was fed and housed,  and, not having been overburdened with work or wages for some time, did  not object to the incarceration.    Ultimately he was tried, found guilty, and fined fifty dollars or a month  in jail. Many arguments arose between magistrate and constable, as the  latter, having served in the United States, and there learned a  smattering of Yankee law, was resolved to make his voice heard in the  case. The inability of the prisoner to pay the fine of course made it  necessary to fall back upon the alternative--thirty days in jail, which  jail was a hundred and odd miles off. There was no conveyance to take him  thither; and no roads even if there had been; and the man refused to  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7128"],[0,"Indian Fairy Tales (#16)"],[1,"in this stream.  I have a plan. You go and kill a small lamb, and bring it here to me.\"    \"All right,\" said the dog, and at once ran off. He soon came back with  a dead lamb, and gave it to the cat. The cat got inside the lamb and  lay down, telling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet.  Not long after this a nadhar, a bird whose look can break the bones  of a fish, came and hovered over the lamb, and eventually pounced down  on it to carry it away. On this the cat came out and jumped on to the  bird, and threatened to kill it if it did not recover the lost ring.  This was most readily promised by the nadhar, who immediately flew off  to the king of the fishes, and ordered it to make inquiries and to  restore the ring. The king of the fishes did so, and the ring was  found and carried back to the cat.    \"Come along now; I have got the ring,\" said the cat to the dog.    \"No, I will not,\" said the dog, \"unless you let me have the ring. I  can carry it as well as you. Let me have it or I will kill you.\" So  the cat was obliged to give up the ring. The careless dog very soon  dropped it again. This time it was picked up and carried off by a  kite.    \"See, see, there it goes--away to that big tree,\" the cat exclaimed.    \"Oh! oh! what have I done?\" cried the dog.    \"You foolish thing, I knew it would be so,\" said the cat. \"But stop  your barking, or you will frighten away the bird to some place where  we shall not be able to trace it.\"    The cat waited till it was quite dark, and then climbed the tree,  killed the kite, and recovered the ring. \"Come along,\" it said to the  dog when it reached the ground. \"We must make haste now. We have been  delayed. Our master will die from grief and suspense. Come on.\"    The dog, now thoroughly ashamed of itself, begged the cat's pardon for  all the trouble it had given. It was afraid to ask for the ring the  third time, so they both reached their sorrowing master in safety and  gave him the precious charm. In a moment his sorrow was turned into  joy. He spoke to the ring, and his beautiful wife and house  reappeared, and he and everybody were as happy as ever they could be.          The Talkative Tortoise      The future Buddha was once born in a minister's family, when  Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares; and when he grew up, he became  the king's adviser in things temporal and spiritual.    Now this king was very talkative; while he was speaking, others had no  opportunity for a word. And the future Buddha, wanting to cure this  talkativeness of his, was constantly seeking for some means of doing  so.    At that time there was living, in a pond in the Himalaya mountains, a  tortoise. Two young hamsas, or wild ducks, who came to feed there,  made friends with him. And one day, when they had become very intimate  with him, they said to the tortoise:    \"Friend tortoise! the place where we live, at the Golden Cave on Mount  Beautiful in the Himalaya country, is a delightful spot. Will you come  there with us?\"    \"But how can I get there?\"    \"We can take you, if you can only hold your tongue, and will say  nothing to anybody.\"    \"Oh! that I can do. Take me with you.\"    \"That's right,\" said they. And making the tortoise bite hold of a  stick, they themselves took the two ends in their teeth, and flew up  into the air.    Seeing him thus carried by the hamsas, some villagers called out, \"Two  wild ducks are carrying a tortoise along on a stick!\" Whereupon the  tortoise wanted to say, \"If my friends choose to carry me, what is  that to you, you wretched slaves!\" So just as the swift flight of the  wild ducks had brought him over the king's palace in the city of  Benares, he let go of the stick he was biting, and falling in the open  courtyard, split in two! And there arose a universal cry, \"A tortoise  has fallen in the open courtyard, and has split in two!\"    [Illustration:]    The king, taking the future Buddha, went to the place, surrounded by  his courtiers; and looking at the tortoise, he asked the Bodisat,  \"Teacher! how comes he to be fallen here?\"    The future Buddha thought to himself, \"Long expecting, wishing to  admonish the king, have I sought for some means of doing so. This  tortoise must have made friends with the wild ducks; and they must  have made him bite hold of the stick, and have flown up into the air  to take him to the hills. But he, being unable to hold his tongue  when he hears any one else talk, must have wanted to say something,  and let go the stick; and so must have fallen down from the sky, and  thus lost his life.\" And saying, \"Truly, O king! those who are called  chatter-boxes--people whose words have no end--come to grief like  this,\" he uttered these Verses:        \"Verily the tortoise killed himself      Whilst uttering his voice;      Though he was holding tight the stick,      By a word himself he slew.        \"Behold him then, O excellent by strength!      And speak wise words, not out of season.      You see how, by his talking overmuch,      The tortoise fell into this wretched plight!\"    The king saw that he was himself referred to, and said, \"O Teacher!  are you speaking of us?\"    And the Bodisat spake openly, and said, \"O great king! be it thou, or  be it any other, whoever talks beyond measure meets with some mishap  like this.\"    And the king henceforth refrained himself, and became a man of few  words.          A Lac of Rupees for a Bit of Advice    [Illustration:]      A poor blind Brahman and his wife were dependent on their son for  their subsistence. Every day the young fellow used to go out and get  what he could by begging. This continued for some time, till at last  he became quite tired of such a wretched life, and determined to go  and try his luck in another country. He informed his wife of his  intention, and ordered her to manage somehow or other for the old  people during the few months that he would be absent. He begged her to  be industrious, lest his parents should be angry and curse him.    One morning he started with some food in a bundle, and walked on day  after day, till he reached the chief city of the neighbouring country.  Here he went and sat down by a merchant's shop and asked alms. The  merchant inquired whence he had come, why he had come, and what was  his caste; to which he replied that he was a Brahman, and was  wandering hither and thither begging a livelihood for himself and wife  and parents. Moved with pity for the man, the merchant advised him to  visit the kind and generous king of that country, and offered to  accompany him to the court. Now at that time it happened that the king  was seeking for a Brahman to look after a golden temple which he had  just had built. His Majesty was very glad, therefore, when he saw the  Brahman and heard that he was good and honest. He at once deputed him  to the charge of this temple, and ordered fifty kharwars of rice and  one hundred rupees to be paid to him every year as wages.    Two months after this, the Brahman's wife, not having heard any news  of her husband, left the house and went in quest of him. By a happy  fate she arrived at the very place that he had reached, where she  heard that every morning at the golden temple a golden rupee was given  in the king's name to any beggar who chose to go for it. Accordingly,  on the following morning she went to the place and met her husband.    \"Why have you come here?\" he asked. \"Why have you left my parents?  Care you not whether they curse me and I die? Go back immediately, and  await my return.\"    \"No, no,\" said the woman. \"I cannot go back to starve and see your old  father and mother die. There is not a grain of rice left in the  house.\"    \"O Bhagawant!\" exclaimed the Brahman. \"Here, take this,\" he continued,  scribbling a few lines on some paper, and then handing it to her, \"and  give it to the king. You will see that he will give you a lac of  rupees for it.\" Thus saying he dismissed her, and the woman left.    On this scrap of paper were written three pieces of advice--First, If  a person is travelling and reaches any strange place at night, let him  be careful where he puts up, and not close his eyes in sleep, lest he  close them in death. Secondly, If a man has a married sister, and  visits her in great pomp, she will receive him for the sake of what  she can obtain from him; but if he comes to her in poverty, she will  frown on him and disown him. Thirdly, If a man has to do any work, he  must do it himself, and do it with might and without fear.    On reaching her home the Brahmani told her parents of her meeting with  her husband, and what a valuable piece of paper he had given her; but  not liking to go before the king herself, she sent one of her  relations. The king read the paper, and ordering the man to be  flogged, dismissed him. The next morning the Brahmani took the paper,  and while she was going along the road to the darbar reading it, the  king's son met her, and asked what she was reading, whereupon she  replied that she held in her hands a paper containing certain bits of  advice, for which she wanted a lac of rupees. The prince asked her to  show it to him, and when he had read it gave her a parwana for the  amount, and rode on. The poor Brahmani was very thankful. That day she  laid in a great store of provisions, sufficient to last them all for a  long time.    In the evening the prince related to his father the meeting with the  woman, and the purchase of the piece of paper. He thought his father  would applaud the act. But it was not so. The king was more angry than  before, and banished his son from the country.    So the prince bade adieu to his mother and relations and friends, and  rode off on his horse, whither he did not know. At nightfall he  arrived at some place, where a man met him, and invited him to lodge  at his house. The prince accepted the invitation, and was treated like  a prince. Matting was spread for him to squat on, and "]]]
