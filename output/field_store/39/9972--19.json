A unanimous cry of horror escaped  us, but died away as we perceived that he had succeeded in clinging to  the trunk of a small tree, which grew on the slope a few steps below  us. Fortunately, we knew that the colonel was good at athletics, and  remarkably cool in danger. Still the moment was a critical one. The  slender stem of the tree might give way at any moment. Our cries of  distress were answered by the sudden appearance of the mysterious Sadhu  with his cow.    They were quietly walking along about twenty feet below us, on such  invisible projections of the rock that a child's foot could barely have  found room to rest there, and they both traveled as calmly, and even  carelessly, as if a comfortable causeway were beneath their feet,  instead of a vertical rock. The Sadhu called out to the colonel to hold  on, and to us to keep quiet. He patted the neck of his monstrous cow,  and untied the rope by which he was leading her. Then, with both hands  he turned her head in our direction, and clucking with his tongue, he  cried \"Chal!\" (go). With a few wild goat-like bounds the animal reached  our path, and stood before us motion-less. A for the Sadhu himself, his  movements were as swift and as goat-like. In a moment he had reached the  tree, tied the rope round the colonel's body, and put him on his legs  again; then, rising higher, with one effort of his strong hand he  hoisted him up to the path. Our colonel was with us once more, rather  pale, and with the loss of his pince-nez, but not of his presence of  mind.    An adventure that had threatened to become a tragedy ended in a farce.    \"What is to be done now?\" was our unanimous inquiry. \"We cannot let you  go alone any further.\"    \"In a few moments it will be dark and we shall be lost,\" said Mr. Y----,  the colonel's secretary.    And, indeed, the sun was dipping below the horizon, and every moment was  precious. In the meanwhile, the Sadhu had fastened the rope round the  cow's neck again and stood before us on the pathway, evidently not  understanding a word of our conversation. His tall, slim figure seemed  as if suspended in the air above the precipice. His long, black hair,  floating in the breeze, alone showed that in him we beheld a living  being and not a magnificent statue of bronze. Forgetting our recent  danger and our present awkward situation, Miss X----, who was a born  artist, exclaimed: \"Look at the majesty of that pure profile; observe  the pose of that man. How beautiful are his outlines seen against the  golden and blue sky. One would say, a Greek Adonis, not a Hindu!\" But  the \"Adonis\" in question put a sudden stop to her ecstasy. He glanced at  Miss X---- with half-pitying, half-kindly, laughing eyes, and said with  his ringing voice in Hindi--    \"Bara-Sahib cannot go any further without the help of someone else's  eyes. Sahib's eyes are his enemies. Let the Sahib ride on my cow. She  cannot stumble.\"    \"I! Ride on a cow, and a five-legged one at that? Never!\" exclaimed the  poor colonel, with such a helpless air, nevertheless, that we burst out  laughing.    \"It will be better for Sahib to sit on a cow than to lie on a chitta\"  (the pyre on which dead bodies are burned), remarked the Sadhu with  modest seriousness. \"Why call forth the hour which has not yet struck?\"    The colonel saw that argument was perfectly useless, and we succeeded in  persuading him to follow the Sadhu's advice, who carefully hoisted him  on the cow's back, then, recommending him to hold on by the fifth leg,  he led the way. We all followed to the best of our ability.    In a few minutes more we were on the verandah of our vihara, where we  found our Hindu friends, who had arrived by another path. We eagerly  related all our adventures, and then looked for the Sadhu, but, in the  meanwhile, he had disappeared together with his cow.    \"Do not look for him, he is gone by a road known only to himself,\"  remarked Gulab-Sing carelessly. \"He knows you are sincere in your  gratitude, but he would not take your money. He is a Sadhu, not a buni,\"  added he proudly.    We remembered that it was reported this proud friend of ours also  belonged to the Sadhu sect. \"Who can tell,\" whispered the colonel in my  ear, \"whether these reports are mere gossip, or the truth?\"    Sadhu-Nanaka must not be confounded with Guru-Nanaka, a leader of the  Sikhs. The former are Adwaitas, the latter monotheists. The Adwaitas  believe only in an impersonal deity named Parabrahm.    In the chief hall of the vihara was a life-sized statue of Bhavani, the  feminine aspect of Shiva. From the bosom of this devaki streams forth  the pure cold water of a mountain spring, which falls into a reservoir  at her feet. Around it lay heaps of sacrificial flowers, rice, betel  leaves and incense. This hall was, in consequence, so damp that we  preferred to spend the night on the verandah in the open air, hanging,  as it were, between sky and earth, and lit from below by numerous fires  kept burning all the night by Gulab-Sing's servants, to scare away wild  beasts, and, from above, by the light of the full moon. A supper was  arranged after the Eastern fashion, on carpets spread upon the floor,  and with thick banana leaves for plates and dishes. The noiselessly  gliding steps of the servants, more silent than ghosts, their white  muslins and red turbans, the limitless depths of space, lost in waves of  moonlight, before us, and behind, the dark vaults of ancient caves,  dug out by unknown races, in unknown times, in honor of an unknown,  prehistoric religion--all these, our surroundings, transported us into a  strange world, and into distant epochs far different from our own.    We had before us representatives of five different peoples, five  different types of costume, each quite unlike the others. All five are  known to us in ethnography under the generic name of Hindus. Similarly  eagles, condors, hawks, vultures, and owls are known to ornithology as  \"birds of prey,\" but the analogous differences are as great. Each of  these five companions, a Rajput, a Bengali, a Madrasi, a Sinhalese and  a Mahratti, is a descendant of a race, the origin of which European  scientists have discussed for over half a century without coming to any  agreement.    Rajputs are called Hindus and are said to belong to the Aryan race; but  they call themselves Suryavansa, that is to say, descendants of Surya or  the sun.    The Brahmans derive their origin from Indu, the moon, and are called  Induvansa; Indu, Soma, or Chandra, meaning moon in Sanskrit. If the  first Aryans, appearing in the prologue of universal history, are  Brahmans, that is to say, the people who, according to Max Muller,  having crossed the Himalayas conquered the country of the five rivers,  then the Rajputs are no Aryans; and if they are Aryans they are not  Brahmans, as all their genealogies and sacred books (Puranas) show that  they are much older than the Brahmans; and, in this case, moreover, the  Aryan tribes had an actual existence in other countries of our globe  than the much renowned district of the Oxus, the cradle of the Germanic  race, the ancestors of Aryans and Hindus, in the fancy of the scientist  we have named and his German school.    The \"moon\" line begins with Pururavas (see the genealogical tree  prepared by Colonel Tod from the MS. Puranas in the Oodeypore archives),  that is to say, two thousand two hundred years before Christ, and much  later than Ikshvaku, the patriarch of the Suryavansa. The fourth son of  Pururavas, Rech, stands at the head of the line of the moon-race, and  only in the fifteenth generation after him appears Harita, who founded  the Kanshikagotra, the Brahman tribe.    The Rajputs hate the latter. They say the children of the sun and Rama  have nothing in common with the children of the moon and Krishna. As  for the Bengalis, according to their traditions and history, they are  aborigines. The Madrasis and the Sinhalese are Dravidians. They have, in  turn, been said to belong to the Semites, the Hamites, the Aryans, and,  lastly, they have been given up to the will of God, with the conclusion  drawn that the Sinhalese, at all events, must be Mongolians of Turanian  origin. The Mahrattis are aborigines of the West of India, as the  Bengalis are of, the East; but to what group of tribes belong these two  nationalities no ethnographer can define, save perhaps a German. The  traditions of the people themselves are generally denied, because they  are not in harmony with foregone conclusions. The meaning of ancient  manuscripts is disfigured, and, in fact, sacrificed to fiction, if only  the latter proceeds from the mouth of some favorite oracle.    The ignorant masses are often blamed and found to be guilty of  superstition for creating idols in the spiritual world. Is not,  then, the educated man, the man who craves after knowledge, who is  enlightened, still more inconsistent than these masses, when he deals  with his favorite authorities? Are not half a dozen laurel-crowned heads  allowed by him to do whatever they like with facts, to draw their own  conclusions, according to their own liking, and does he not stone  every one who would dare to rise against the decisions of these  quasi-infallible specialists, and brand him as an ignorant fool?    Let us remember the case in point of Louis Jacolliot, who spent twenty  years in India, who actually knew the language and the country to  perfection, and who, nevertheless, was rolled in the mud by Max Muller,  whose foot never touched Indian soil.    The oldest peoples of Europe are mere babes com-pared with the tribes  of Asia, and especially of India. And oh! how poor and insignificant are  the genealogies of the oldest European families compared with those of  some Rajputs. In the opinion of Colonel Tod, who for over twenty years  studied these genealogies on the spot,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6702"],[0,"Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe (#16)"],[1,"would permit the publishing of an abolition  paper, and to this meeting all the most respectable citizens were by  name summoned.    \"There were four classes in the city then: Those who meant to go as  revolutionists and support the mob; those who meant to put down  Birney, but rather hoped to do it without a mob; those who felt ashamed  to go, foreseeing the probable consequence, and yet did not decidedly  frown upon it; and those who sternly and decidedly reprehended it.    \"The first class was headed by Neville, Longworth, Graham, etc.; the  second class, though of some numbers, was less conspicuous; of the  third, Judge Burnet, Dr. Fore, and N. Wright were specimens; and in  the last such men as Hammond, Mansfield, S. P. Chase,[3] and Chester  were prominent. The meeting in so many words voted a mob, nevertheless  a committee was appointed to wait on Mr. Birney and ascertain what he  proposed to do; and, strange to tell, men as sensible as Uncle John and  Judge Burnet were so short-sighted as to act on that committee.    \"All the newspapers in the city, except Hammond's ('Gazette') and  Henry's (the 'Journal'), were either silent or openly 'mobocratic.' As  might have been expected, Birney refused to leave, and that night the  mob tore down his press, scattered the types, dragged the whole to the  river, threw it in, and then came back to demolish the office.    \"They then went to the houses of Dr. Bailey, Mr. Donaldson, and Mr.  Birney; but the persons they sought were not at home, having been  aware of what was intended. The mayor was a silent spectator of these  proceedings, and was heard to say, 'Well, lads, you have done well, so  far; go home now before you disgrace yourselves;' but the 'lads' spent  the rest of the night and a greater part of the next day (Sunday) in  pulling down the houses of inoffensive and respectable blacks. The  'Gazette' office was threatened, the 'Journal' office was to go next;  Lane Seminary and the water-works also were mentioned as probable  points to be attacked by the mob.    \"By Tuesday morning the city was pretty well alarmed. A regular corps  of volunteers was organized, who for three nights patrolled the streets  with firearms and with legal warrant from the mayor, who by this time  was glad to give it, to put down the mob even by bloodshed.    \"For a day or two we did not know but there would actually be war  to the knife, as was threatened by the mob, and we really saw Henry  depart with his pistols with daily alarm, only we were all too full of  patriotism not to have sent every brother we had rather than not have  had the principles of freedom and order defended.    \"But here the tide turned. The mob, unsupported by a now frightened  community, slunk into their dens and were still; and then Hammond,  who, during the few days of its prevalence, had made no comments, but  published simply the Sermon on the Mount, the Constitution of Ohio,  and the Declaration of Independence, without any comment, now came  out and gave a simple, concise history of the mob, tracing it to the  market-house meeting, telling the whole history of the meeting, with  the names of those who got it up, throwing on them and on those who  had acted on the committee the whole responsibility of the following  mob. It makes a terrible sensation, but it 'cuts its way,' and all who  took other stand than that of steady opposition from the first are  beginning to feel the reaction of public sentiment, while newspapers  from abroad are pouring in their reprehensions of the disgraceful  conduct of Cincinnati. Another time, I suspect, such men as Judge  Burnet, Mr. Greene, and Uncle John will keep their fingers out of such  a trap, and people will all learn better than to wink at a mob that  happens to please them at the outset, or in any way to give it their  countenance. Mr. Greene and Uncle John were full of wrath against mobs,  and would not go to the meeting, and yet were cajoled into acting on  that committee in the vain hope of getting Birney to go away and thus  preventing the outrage.    \"They are justly punished, I think, for what was very irresolute and  foolish conduct, to say the least.\"    The general tone of her letters at this time would seem to show that,  while Mrs. Stowe was anti-slavery in her sympathies, she was not a  declared abolitionist. This is still further borne out in a letter  written in 1837 from Putnam, Ohio, whither she had gone for a short  visit to her brother William. In it she says:--    \"The good people here, you know, are about half abolitionists. A lady  who takes a leading part in the female society in this place yesterday  called and brought Catherine the proceedings of the Female Anti-Slavery  Convention.    \"I should think them about as ultra as to measures as anything that has  been attempted, though I am glad to see a better spirit than marks such  proceedings generally.    \"To-day I read some in Mr. Birney's 'Philanthropist.' Abolitionism  being the fashion here, it is natural to look at its papers.    \"It does seem to me that there needs to be an _intermediate_ society.  If not, as light increases, all the excesses of the abolition party  will not prevent humane and conscientious men from joining it.    \"Pray what is there in Cincinnati to satisfy one whose mind is awakened  on this subject? No one can have the system of slavery brought before  him without an irrepressible desire to _do_ something, and what is  there to be done?\"    On September 29, 1836, while Professor Stowe was still absent in  Europe, his wife gave birth to twin daughters, Eliza and Isabella, as  she named them; but Eliza Tyler and Harriet Beecher, as her husband  insisted they should be called, when, upon reaching New York, he was  greeted by the joyful news. His trip from London in the ship Gladiator  had been unusually long, even for those days of sailing vessels, and  extended from November 19, 1836, to January 20, 1837.    During the summer of 1837 Mrs. Stowe suffered much from ill health, on  which account, and to relieve her from domestic cares, she was sent to  make a long visit at Putnam with her brother, Rev. William Beecher.  While here she received a letter from her husband, in which he says:--    \"We all of course feel proper indignation at the doings of last General  Assembly, and shall treat them with merited contempt. This alliance  between the old school (Presbyterians) and slaveholders will make more  abolitionists than anything that has been done yet.\"    In December Professor Stowe went to Columbus with the extended  educational report that he had devoted the summer to preparing; and in  writing from there to his wife he says:--    \"To-day I have been visiting the governor and legislators. They  received me with the utmost kindness, and are evidently anticipating  much from my report. The governor communicated it to the legislature  to-day, and it is concluded that I read it in Dr. Hodges' church on  two evenings, to-morrow and the day after, before both houses of the  legislature and the citizens. The governor (Vance) will preside at both  meetings. I like him (the governor) much. He is just such a plain,  simple-hearted, sturdy body as old Fritz (Kaiser Frederick), with more  of natural talent than his predecessor in the gubernatorial chair. For  my year's work in this matter I am to receive $500.\"    On January 14, 1838, Mrs. Stowe's third child, Henry Ellis, was born.    It was about this time that the famous reunion of the Beecher family  described in Lyman Beecher's \"Autobiography\" occurred. Edward made a  visit to the East, and when he returned he brought Mary (Mrs. Thomas  Perkins) from Hartford with him. William came down from Putnam, Ohio,  and George from Batavia, New York, while Catherine, Harriet, Henry,  Charles, Isabella, Thomas, and James were already at home. It was the  first time they had ever all met together. Mary had never seen James,  and had seen Thomas but once. The old doctor was almost transported  with joy as they all gathered about him, and his cup of happiness was  filled to overflowing when, the next day, which was Sunday, his pulpit  was filled by Edward in the morning, William in the afternoon, and  George in the evening.    Side by side with this charming picture we have another of domestic  life outlined by Mrs. Stowe's own hand. It is contained in the  following letter, written June 21, 1838, to Miss May, at New Haven,  Conn.:--        MY DEAR, DEAR GEORGIANA,--Only think how long it is      since I have written to you, and how changed I am since      then--the mother of three children! Well, if I have      not kept the reckoning of old times, let this last      circumstance prove my apology, for I have been hand,      heart, and head full since I saw you.        Now, to-day, for example, I'll tell you what I had      on my mind from dawn to dewy eve. In the first place      I waked about half after four and thought, \"Bless      me, how light it is! I must get out of bed and rap      to wake up Mina, for breakfast must be had at six      o'clock this morning.\" So out of bed I jump and seize      the tongs and pound, pound, pound over poor Mina's      sleepy head, charitably allowing her about half an      hour to get waked up in,--that being the quantum of      time that it takes me,--or used to. Well, then baby      wakes--qua, qua, qua, so I give him his breakfast,      dozing meanwhile and soliloquizing as follows: \"Now I      must not forget to tell Mr. Stowe about the starch and      dried apples\"--doze--\"ah, um, dear me! why doesn't Mina      get up? I don't hear her,\"--doze--\"a, um,--I wonder if      Mina has soap enough! I think there were two bars left      on Saturday\"--doze again--I wake again. \"Dear me, broad      daylight! I must get up and go down and see if Mina is      getting breakfast.\" Up I jump and up wakes baby. \"Now,      little boy, be good and let mother dress, because she      is in a hurry.\" I get "]]]
