Happening to turn his back for a moment,  to observe something in camp, Meek and Reese snatched the tempting  viand and made off with it, before the darkey discovered his loss. But  when it was discovered, what a wail went up for the embezzled porcupine!  Suspicion fixed upon the guilty parties, but as no one would 'peach on  white men to save a \"nigger's\" rights, the poor, disappointed boy could  do nothing but lament in vain, to the great amusement of the men, who  upon the principle that \"misery loves company,\" rather chuckled over  than condemned Meek's \"mean act.\"    There was a sequel, however, to this little story. So much did the negro  dwell upon the event, and the heartlessness of the men towards him, that  in the following summer, when Smith was in St. Louis, he gave the boy  his freedom and two hundred dollars, and left him in that city; so that  it became a saying in the mountains, that \"the nigger got his freedom  for a porcupine.\"    During this same march, a similar joke was played upon one of the men  named Craig. He had caught a rabbit and put it up to roast before the  fire--a tempting looking morsel to starving mountaineers. Some of his  associates determined to see how it tasted, and Craig was told that the  Booshways wished to speak with him at their lodge. While he obeyed this  supposed command, the rabbit was spirited away, never more to be seen by  mortal man. When Craig returned to the camp-fire, and beheld the place  vacant where a rabbit so late was nicely roasting, his passion knew no  bounds, and he declared his intention of cutting it out of the stomach  that contained it. But as finding the identical stomach which contained  it involved the cutting open of many that probably did not, in the  search, he was fain to relinquish that mode of vengeance, together with  his hopes of a supper. As Craig is still living, and is tormented by the  belief that he knows the man who stole his rabbit, Mr. Meek takes this  opportunity of assuring him, upon the word of a gentleman, that _he_ is  not the man.    While on the march over these mountains, owing to the depth of the snow,  the company lost a hundred head of horses and mules, which sank in the  yet unfrozen drifts, and could not be extricated. In despair at their  situation, Jedediah Smith one day sent a man named Harris to the top of  a high peak to take a view of the country, and ascertain their position.  After a toilsome scramble the scout returned.    \"Well, what did you see, Harris?\" asked Smith anxiously.    \"I saw the city of St. Louis, and one fellow taking a drink!\" replied  Harris; prefacing the assertion with a shocking oath.    Smith asked no more questions. He understood by the man's answer that he  had made no pleasing discoveries; and knew that they had still a weary  way before them to reach the plains below. Besides, Smith was a  religious man, and the coarse profanity of the mountaineers was very  distasteful to him. \"A very mild man, and a christian; and there were  very few of them in the mountains,\" is the account given of him by the  mountaineers themselves.    The camp finally arrived without loss of life, except to the animals, on  the plains of the Bighorn River, and came upon the waters of the  Stinking Fork, a branch of this river, which derives its unfortunate  appellation from the fact that it flows through a volcanic tract similar  to the one discovered by Meek on the Yellowstone plains. This place  afforded as much food for wonder to the whole camp, as the former one  had to Joe; and the men unanimously pronounced it the \"back door to that  country which divines preach about.\" As this volcanic district had  previously been seen by one of Lewis and Clarke's men, named Colter,  while on a solitary hunt, and by him also denominated \"hell,\" there must  certainly have been something very suggestive in its appearance.    If the mountains had proven barren, and inhospitably cold, this hot and  sulphurous country offered no greater hospitality. In fact, the fumes  which pervaded the air rendered it exceedingly noxious to every living  thing, and the camp was fain to push on to the main stream of the  Bighorn River. Here signs of trappers became apparent, and spies having  been sent out discovered a camp of about forty men, under Milton  Sublette, brother of Captain William Sublette, the same that had been  detached the previous summer to hunt in that country. Smith and Sublette  then cached their furs, and moving up the river joined the camp of M.  Sublette.    The manner of caching furs is this: A pit is dug to a depth of five or  six feet in which to stand. The men then drift from this under a bank of  solid earth, and excavate a room of considerable dimensions, in which  the furs are deposited, and the apartment closed up. The pit is then  filled up with earth, and the traces of digging obliterated or  concealed. These caches are the only storehouses of the wilderness.    While the men were recruiting themselves in the joint camp, the alarm of  \"Indians!\" was given, and hurried cries of \"shoot! shoot!\" were uttered  on the instant. Captain Sublette, however, checked this precipitation,  and ordering the men to hold, allowed the Indians to approach, making  signs of peace. They proved to be a war party of Crows, who after  smoking the pipe of peace with the Captain, received from him a present  of some tobacco, and departed.    As soon as the camp was sufficiently recruited for traveling, the united  companies set out again toward the south, and crossed the Horn mountains  once more into Wind River Valley; having had altogether, a successful  fall hunt, and made some important explorations, notwithstanding the  severity of the weather and the difficulty of mountain traveling. It was  about Christmas when the camp arrived on Wind River, and the cold  intense. While the men celebrated Christmas, as best they might under  the circumstances, Capt. Sublette started to St. Louis with one man,  Harris, called among mountain-men Black Harris, on snowshoes, with a  train of pack-dogs. Such was the indomitable energy and courage of this  famous leader!          CHAPTER IV.      1830. The furs collected by Jackson's company were cached on the Wind  River; and the cold still being very severe, and game scarce, the two  remaining leaders, Smith and Jackson, set out on the first of January  with the whole camp, for the buffalo country, on the Powder River, a  distance of about one hundred and fifty miles. \"Times were hard in  camp,\" when mountains had to be crossed in the depth of winter.    The animals had to be subsisted on the bark of the sweet cotton-wood,  which grows along the streams and in the valleys on the east side of the  Rocky Mountains, but is nowhere to be found west of that range. This way  of providing for his horses and mules involved no trifling amount of  labor, when each man had to furnish food for several of them. To collect  this bark, the men carried the smooth limbs of the cotton-wood to camp,  where, beside the camp-fire, they shaved off the sweet, green bark with  a hunting-knife transformed into a drawing-knife by fastening a piece of  wood to its point; or, in case the cotton-wood was not convenient, the  bark was peeled off, and carried to camp in a blanket. So nutritious is  it, that animals fatten upon it quite as well as upon oats.    [Illustration: HUNTER'S WINTER CAMP.]    In the large cotton-wood bottoms on the Yellowstone River, it sometimes  became necessary to station a double guard to keep the buffalo out of  camp, so numerous were they, when the severity of the cold drove them  from the prairies to these cotton-wood thickets for subsistence. It  was, therefore, of double importance to make the winter camp where the  cotton-wood was plenty; since not only did it furnish the animals of the  camp with food, but by attracting buffalo, made game plenty for the men.  To such a hunter's paradise on Powder River, the camp was now traveling,  and arrived, after a hard, cold march, about the middle of January, when  the whole encampment went into winter quarters, to remain until the  opening of spring.    This was the occasion when the mountain-man \"lived fat\" and enjoyed  life: a season of plenty, of relaxation, of amusement, of  acquaintanceship with all the company, of gayety, and of \"busy  idleness.\" Through the day, hunting parties were coming and going, men  were cooking, drying meat, making moccasins, cleaning their arms,  wrestling, playing games, and, in short, everything that an isolated  community of hardy men could resort to for occupation, was resorted to  by these mountaineers. Nor was there wanting, in the appearance of the  camp, the variety, and that picturesque air imparted by a mingling of  the native element; for what with their Indian allies, their native  wives, and numerous children, the mountaineers' camp was a motley  assemblage; and the trappers themselves, with their affectation of  Indian coxcombry, not the least picturesque individuals.    The change wrought in a wilderness landscape by the arrival of the grand  camp was wonderful indeed. Instead of Nature's superb silence and  majestic loneliness, there was the sound of men's voices in boisterous  laughter, or the busy hum of conversation; the loud-resounding stroke of  the axe; the sharp report of the rifle; the neighing of horses, and  braying of mules; the Indian whoop and yell; and all that not unpleasing  confusion of sound which accompanies the movements of the creature man.  Over the plain, only dotted until now with shadows of clouds, or the  transitory passage of the deer, the antelope, or the bear, were  scattered hundreds of lodges and immense herds of grazing animals.

They have been called by the French Aracari; which name I have retained as  an English generic distinction. They inhabit the same country and  situations as the real Toucans, which are distinguished by having a short,  broad, and even tail, and the nostrils placed behind the bill.    A fine example of this very rare bird I first met with in the small  collection sent to my excellent friend, E. Falkener, Esq. from the Spanish  Main. I have since noticed another which was in Mr. Bullock's museum, and  is now in the possession of Lord Stanley: these are the only two specimens  known.    This bird was first described by me in the Journal of the Royal Institution  near a year ago. When Professor Temminck was in England, I showed him the  manuscript description and drawing which I had then made: he assured me he  had never seen the bird before, otherwise than in Bullock's museum. A short  time after, my account of it was published. I observe, however, that in the  new edition of his Manuel he gives this name to a new bird of his own: no  description however follows, and it is therefore impossible to say if the  Professor intends it for this identical species.    We must postpone any further observations on this family, and conclude by  giving the original description above alluded to.    Total length twelve inches, of which the bill in extreme length measures  three. It is much curved, and more attenuated than any of the Aracaris,  being thickest at the base; from which it narrows to a sharp point at the  tip. The upper part is convex, and somewhat thickened; the sides are  compressed, and the upper mandible has two broad slightly indented grooves  on each side: the base has a few transverse wrinkles, and the serratures  deep and unequal. The lower mandible half the depth of the upper, the sides  concave, and the teeth less. The colour (in the dried bird) black; the base  of the lower and the upper half of the superior mandible rufous, the base  with a whitish marginal line. The nostrils are more lateral than usual,  being placed in a line with the eye; the orbits naked and reddish brown,  the feathers encircling which (particularly beneath the eye) are vivid  cerulean blue. The whole upper plumage is parrot green, paler beneath, with  a gloss of golden yellow on the cheeks and sides: throat dusky white. Wings  short, five inches long, and rounded; inner shafts of the quills black,  margined with whiteish. Tail cuneated, green, four inches and a half long,  the four middle feathers equal. Legs dusky black.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 45    [Illustration]    RAMPHASTOS carinatus,    _Sharp-billed Toucan._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum capite longius, maximum, crassum, inane, cultratum, basali      margine incrassatum; maxillae angulo frontali subtruncato transverso:      Nares verticales, pone maxillae basin sitae; tomia serrata; lingua      angusta, pennacea; cauda brevis, aequalis; pedes scansorii._ Illiger.

A question naturally arises, why  the bills of these birds should be so monstrously out of proportion, and  what possible use they can be applied to. The elucidation of these  questions is highly interesting, and calls for the most accurate  observations to be made in their native regions. It will be sufficient for  the present, however, to point out, with regard to the Linnaean Toucans,  that the accurate observations and anatomical knowledge of my valued friend  Dr. Traill, F.R.S.E., of Liverpool, have clearly proved that an immense  number of nerves and fibres fill the cavity of these bills, all connected  with the organs of smelling, which are in the highest state of development.  A short notice on this subject will be found in the Linnaean Transactions;  but as my learned friend is pursuing his inquiries further on the subject,  I shall for the present confine my remarks to the individual here  illustrated, observing that no birds are so little understood, even in  regard to the species, as these.    The indefatigable Edwards appears the first who noticed this bird. His  description, though in the quaint style of the day, is clear and  comprehensive; and his figure strengthens it, both being made from the  living bird. Yet Dr. Latham has quite overlooked it as a variety of another  species; and Dr. Shaw, although he copies Edwards's account, gives  references which belong to other birds. It is not in the costly work of Le  Vaillant, and indeed seems (from its excessive rarity) to have escaped the  notice of all modern ornithologists. The perfect bill of the bird is,  however, in my possession, minutely agreeing with Edwards's account; and  also an original sketch in oil of another individual, by an unknown artist,  with a note stating it was done from the life at Exeter 'Change. All these  testimonies put the existence of the bird beyond any doubt.    Having seen only the bill, which is well described by Edwards, I shall  close this article with such part of his description as appears necessary.    \"The bill is very large, compressed sideways, having _a sharp ridge along  the upper part_; the upper mandible is green, with a long triangular spot  of yellow colour on each side, and the ridge on the upper part yellow; the  lower mandible is blue, with a shade of green in the middle, the point is  red, it hath about five faint dusky bars, which cross the joinings of the  two mandibles. The iris of the eye is a fair green colour; round the eye is  a broad space of naked skin of a violet colour: the throat and breast are  of a bright yellow, below which is a bar of scarlet feathers; the covert  feathers of the tail are white above, beneath of a bright red; the legs and  feet are all of a blue or violet colour.\" Edwards says it was brought from  Jamaica, but doubts its being rather a native of the continent: he says  they are very rarely brought home alive.    The bill is full six inches long, and the whole figure on the same scale,  both in this and in Edwards.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 46    [Illustration]    BULIMUS citrinus,    _Citron Bulimus._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 4.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _B. testa obovata; spira conica, in medio sub-crassata, apertura      longiore: spira anfractibus 6 in suturam depressis; labio exteriore      basi subcontracto; umbilico subclauso._        Shell obovate; spire conic, slightly thickened in the middle, longer      than the aperture, and of six volutions depressed on the suture;      outer-lip slightly contracted at the base; umbilicus nearly closed.

As far as my own observation  goes, I have found that the thickened spire, the depression of the whorls  on the suture, and the narrowness or contraction of the mouth at the base,  afford the only constant characters; for, in regard to colour and the  situation of the mouth, both appear subject to great variation, the latter  being as often reversed as regular. Martini's is the only figure that can  be safely quoted for this variety.
