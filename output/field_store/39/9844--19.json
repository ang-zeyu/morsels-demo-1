[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4351"],[0,"The English Constitution (#16)"],[1," which forbid the  election of known men, except at peculiar conjunctures, and in moments  when public opinion is excited and despotic; and consequently if a  crisis comes upon us soon after he is elected, inevitably we have  government by an unknown quantity--the superintendence of that crisis  by what our great satirist would have called \"Statesman X\". Even in  quiet times, government by a President, is, for the several various  reasons which have been stated, inferior to government by a Cabinet;  but the difficulty of quiet times is nothing as compared with the  difficulty of unquiet times. The comparative deficiencies of the  regular, common operation of a Presidential government are far less  than the comparative deficiencies in time of sudden trouble--the want  of elasticity, the impossibility of a dictatorship, the total absence  of a REVOLUTIONARY RESERVE. This contrast explains why the  characteristic quality of Cabinet Governments--the fusion of the  executive power with the legislative power--is of such cardinal  importance. I shall proceed to show under what form and with what  adjuncts it exists in England.      [4] The framers of the Constitution expected that the vice-president  would be elected by the Electoral College as the second wisest man in  the country. The vice-presidentship being a sinecure, a second-rate man  agreeable to the wire-pullers is always smuggled in. The chance of  succession to the presidentship is too distant to be thought of.          NO. III.    THE MONARCHY.      I.    The use of the Queen, in a dignified capacity, is incalculable. Without  her in England, the present English Government would fail and pass  away. Most people when they read that the Queen walked on the slopes at  Windsor--that the Prince of Wales went to the Derby--have imagined that  too much thought and prominence were given to little things. But they  have been in error; and it is nice to trace how the actions of a  retired widow and an unemployed youth become of such importance.    The best reason why Monarchy is a strong government is, that it is an  intelligible government. The mass of mankind understand it, and they  hardly anywhere in the world understand any other. It is often said  that men are ruled by their imaginations; but it would be truer to say  they are governed by the weakness of their imaginations. The nature of  a constitution, the action of an assembly, the play of parties, the  unseen formation of a guiding opinion, are complex facts, difficult to  know and easy to mistake. But the action of a single will, the fiat of  a single mind, are easy ideas: anybody can make them out, and no one  can ever forget them. When you put before the mass of mankind the  question, \"Will you be governed by a king, or will you be governed by a  constitution?\" the inquiry comes out thus--\"Will you be governed in a  way you understand, or will you be governed in a way you do not  understand?\" The issue was put to the French people; they were asked,  \"Will you be governed by Louis Napoleon, or will you be governed by an  assembly?\" The French people said, \"We will be governed by the one man  we can imagine, and not by the many people we cannot imagine\".    The best mode of comprehending the nature of the two Governments, is to  look at a country in which the two have within a comparatively short  space of years succeeded each other.    \"The political condition,\" says Mr. Grote, \"which Grecian legend  everywhere presents to us, is in its principal features strikingly  different from that which had become universally prevalent among the  Greeks in the time of the Peloponnesian War. Historical oligarchy, as  well as democracy, agreed in requiring a certain established system of  government, comprising the three elements of specialised functions,  temporary functionaries, and ultimate responsibility (under some forms  or other) to the mass of qualified citizens--either a Senate or an  Ecclesia, or both. There were, of course, many and capital distinctions  between one Government and another, in respect to the qualification of  the citizen, the attributes and efficiency of the general assembly, the  admissibility to power, etc.; and men might often be dissatisfied with  the way in which these questions were determined in their own city. But  in the mind of every man, some determining rule or system--something  like what in modern times is called a CONSTITUTION--was indispensable  to any Government entitled to be called legitimate, or capable of  creating in the mind of a Greek a feeling of moral obligation to obey  it. The functionaries who exercise authority under it might be more or  less competent or popular; but his personal feelings towards them were  commonly lost in his attachment or aversion to the general system. If  any energetic man could by audacity or craft break down the  Constitution, and render himself permanent ruler according to his own  will and pleasure, even though he might govern well, he could never  inspire the people with any sentiment of duty towards him: his sceptre  was illegitimate from the beginning, and even the taking of his life,  far from being interdicted by that moral feeling which condemned the  shedding of blood in other cases, was considered meritorious: he could  not even be mentioned in the language except by a name (_tyrannos_,  despot) which branded him as an object of mingled fear and dislike.    \"If we carry our eyes back from historical to legendary Greece, we find  a picture the reverse of what has been here sketched. We discern a  government in which there is little or no scheme or system, still less  any idea of responsibility to the governed, but in which the mainspring  of obedience on the part of the people consists in their personal  feeling and reverence towards the chief. We remark, first and foremost,  the King; next, a limited number of subordinate kings or chiefs;  afterwards, the mass of armed freemen, husbandmen, artisans,  freebooters, &c.; lowest of all, the free labourers for hire and the  bought slaves. The King is not distinguished by any broad, or  impassable boundary from the other chiefs, to each of whom the title  Basileus is applicable as well as to himself: his supremacy has been  inherited from his ancestors, and passes by inheritance, as a general  rule, to his eldest son, having been conferred upon the family as a  privilege by the favour of Zeus. In war, he is the leader, foremost in  personal prowess, and directing all military movements; in peace, he is  the general protector of the injured and oppressed; he offers up  moreover those public prayers and sacrifices which are intended to  obtain for the whole people the favour of the gods. An ample domain is  assigned to him as an appurtenance of his lofty position, and the  produce of his fields and his cattle is consecrated in part to an  abundant, though rude hospitality. Moreover he receives frequent  presents, to avert his enmity, to conciliate his favour, or to buy off  his exactions; and when plunder is taken from the enemy, a large  previous share, comprising probably the most alluring female captive,  is reserved for him apart from the general distribution.    \"Such is the position of the King in the heroic times of Greece--the  only person (if we except the herald, and priests, each both special  and subordinate) who is then presented to us as clothed with any  individual authority--the person by whom all the executive functions,  then few in number, which the society requires, are either performed or  directed. His personal ascendancy--derived from Divine countenance  bestowed both upon himself individually and upon his race, and probably  from accredited Divine descent--is the salient feature in the picture:  the people hearken to his voice, embrace his propositions, and obey his  orders: not merely resistance, but even criticism upon his acts, is  generally exhibited in an odious point of view, and is indeed never  heard of except from some one or more of the subordinate princes.\"    The characteristic of the English Monarchy is that it retains the  feelings by which the heroic kings governed their rude age, and has  added the feelings by which the Constitutions of later Greece ruled in  more refined ages. We are a more mixed people than the Athenians, or  probably than any political Greeks. We have progressed more unequally.  The slaves in ancient times were a separate order; not ruled by the  same laws, or thoughts, as other men. It was not necessary to think of  them in making a constitution: it was not necessary to improve them in  order to make a constitution possible. The Greek legislator had not to  combine in his polity men like the labourers of Somersetshire, and men  like Mr. Grote. He had not to deal with a community in which primitive  barbarism lay as a recognised basis to acquired civilisation. WE HAVE.  We have no slaves to keep down by special terrors and independent  legislation. But we have whole classes unable to comprehend the idea of  a constitution--unable to feel the least attachment to impersonal laws.  Most do indeed vaguely know that there are some other institutions  besides the Queen, and some rules by which she governs. But a vast  number like their minds to dwell more upon her than upon anything else,  and therefore she is inestimable. A republic has only difficult ideas  in government; a Constitutional Monarchy has an easy idea too; it has a  comprehensible element for the vacant many, as well as complex laws and  notions for the inquiring few.    A FAMILY on the throne is an interesting idea also. It brings down the  pride of sovereignty to the level of petty life. No feeling could seem  more childish than the enthusiasm of the English at the marriage of the  Prince of Wales. They treated as a great political event, what, looked  at as a matter of pure business, was very small indeed. But no feeling  could be more like common human nature"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#16)"],[1,"eceived, \"Your kindness of the third  ult.,\" thus transposing the commercial formula, \"Your favour of the  third instant.\" This class of the comic, moreover, may attain a special  profundity of its own when it discloses not merely a professional  practice, but a fault in character. Recall to mind the scenes in the  Faux Bonshommes and the Famille Benoiton, where marriage is dealt with  as a business affair, and matters of sentiment are set down in strictly  commercial language.    Here, however, we reach the point at which peculiarities of language  really express peculiarities of character, a closer investigation of  which we must hold over to the next chapter. Thus, as might have been  expected and may be seen from the foregoing, the comic in words follows  closely on the comic in situation and is finally merged, along with the  latter, in the comic in character. Language only attains laughable  results because it is a human product, modelled as exactly as possible  on the forms of the human mind. We feel it contains some living element  of our own life; and if this life of language were complete and  perfect, if there were nothing stereotype in it, if, in short, language  were an absolutely unified organism incapable of being split up into  independent organisms, it would evade the comic as would a soul whose  life was one harmonious whole, unruffled as the calm surface of a  peaceful lake. There is no pool, however, which has not some dead  leaves floating on its surface, no human soul upon which there do not  settle habits that make it rigid against itself by making it rigid  against others, no language, in short, so subtle and instinct with  life, so fully alert in each of its parts as to eliminate the  ready-made and oppose the mechanical operations of inversion,  transposition, etc., which one would fain perform upon it as on some  lifeless thing. The rigid, the ready--made, the mechanical, in contrast  with the supple, the ever-changing and the living, absentmindedness in  contrast with attention, in a word, automatism in contrast with free  activity, such are the defects that laughter singles out and would fain  correct. We appealed to this idea to give us light at the outset, when  starting upon the analysis of the ludicrous. We have seen it shining at  every decisive turning in our road. With its help, we shall now enter  upon a more important investigation, one that will, we hope, be more  instructive. We purpose, in short, studying comic characters, or rather  determining the essential conditions of comedy in character, while  endeavouring to bring it about that this study may contribute to a  better understanding of the real nature of art and the general relation  between art and life.          CHAPTER III    THE COMIC IN CHARACTER      I    We have followed the comic along many of its winding channels in an  endeavour to discover how it percolates into a form, an attitude, or a  gesture; a situation, an action, or an expression. The analysis of  comic CHARACTERS has now brought us to the most important part of our  task. It would also be the most difficult, had we yielded to the  temptation of defining the laughable by a few striking--and  consequently obvious--examples; for then, in proportion as we advanced  towards the loftiest manifestations of the comic, we should have found  the facts slipping between the over-wide meshes of the definition  intended to retain them. But, as a matter of fact, we have followed the  opposite plan, by throwing light on the subject from above. Convinced  that laughter has a social meaning and import, that the comic  expresses, above all else, a special lack of adaptability to society,  and that, in short, there is nothing comic apart from man, we have made  man and character generally our main objective. Our chief difficulty,  therefore, has lain in explaining how we come to laugh at anything else  than character, and by what subtle processes of fertilisation,  combination or amalgamation, the comic can worm its way into a mere  movement, an impersonal situation, or an independent phrase. This is  what we have done so far. We started with the pure metal, and all our  endeavours have been directed solely towards reconstructing the ore. It  is the metal itself we are now about to study. Nothing could be easier,  for this time we have a simple element to deal with. Let us examine it  closely and see how it reacts upon everything else.    There are moods, we said, which move us as soon us as soon as we  perceive them, joys and sorrows with which we sympathise, passions and  vices which call forth painful astonishment, terror or pity, in the  beholder; in short, sentiments that are prolonged in sentimental  overtones from mind to mind. All this concerns the essentials of life.  All this is serious, at times even tragic. Comedy can only begin at the  point where our neighbour's personality ceases to affect us. It begins,  in fact, with what might be called a growing callousness to social  life. Any individual is comic who automatically goes his own way  without troubling himself about getting into touch with the rest of his  fellow-beings. It is the part of laughter to reprove his  absentmindedness and wake him out of his dream. If it is permissible to  compare important things with trivial ones, we would call to mind what  happens when a youth enters one of our military academies. After  getting through the dreaded ordeal of the examination, he finds the has  other ordeals to face, which his seniors have arranged with the object  of fitting him for the new life he is entering upon, or, as they say,  of \"breaking him into harness.\" Every small society that forms within  the larger is thus impelled, by a vague kind of instinct, to devise  some method of discipline or \"breaking in,\" so as to deal with the  rigidity of habits that have been formed elsewhere and have now to  undergo a partial modification. Society, properly so-called, proceeds  in exactly the same way. Each member must be ever attentive to his  social surroundings; he must model himself on his environment; in  short, he must avoid shutting himself up in his own peculiar character  as a philosopher in his ivory tower. Therefore society holds suspended  over each individual member, if not the threat of correction, at all  events the prospect of a snubbing, which, although it is slight, is  none the less dreaded. Such must be the function of laughter. Always  rather humiliating for the one against whom it is directed, laughter  is, really and truly, a kind of social \"ragging.\"    Hence the equivocal nature of the comic. It belongs neither altogether  to art nor altogether to life. On the one hand, characters in real life  would never make us laugh were we not capable of watching their  vagaries in the same way as we look down at a play from our seat in a  box; they are only comic in our eyes because they perform a kind of  comedy before us. But, on the other hand, the pleasure caused by  laughter, even on the stage, is not an unadulterated enjoyment; it is  not a pleasure that is exclusively esthetic or altogether  disinterested. It always implies a secret or unconscious intent, if not  of each one of us, at all events of society as a whole. In laughter we  always find an unavowed intention to humiliate, and consequently to  correct our neighbour, if not in his will, at least in his deed. This  is the reason a comedy is far more like real life than a drama is. The  more sublime the drama, the more profound the analysis to which the  poet has had to subject the raw materials of daily life in order to  obtain the tragic element in its unadulterated form. On the contrary,  it is only in its lower aspects, in light comedy and farce, that comedy  is in striking contrast to reality: the higher it rises, the more it  approximates to life; in fact, there are scenes in real life so closely  bordering on high-class comedy that the stage might adopt them without  changing a single word.    Hence it follows that the elements of comic character on the stage and  in actual life will be the same. What are these elements? We shall find  no difficulty in deducing them. It has often been said that it is the  TRIFLING faults of our fellow-men that make us laugh.    Evidently there is a considerable amount of truth in this opinion;  still, it cannot be regarded as altogether correct. First, as regards  faults, it is no easy matter to draw the line between the trifling and  the serious; maybe it is not because a fault is trifling that it makes  us laugh, but rather because it makes us laugh that we regard it as  trifling, for there is nothing disarms us like laughter. But we may go  even farther, and maintain that there are faults at which we laugh,  even though fully aware that they are serious,--Harpagon's avarice, for  instance. And then, we may as well confess--though somewhat  reluctantly--that we laugh not only at the faults of our fellow-men,  but also, at times, at their good qualities. We laugh at Alceste. The  objection may be urged that it is not the earnestness of Alceste that  is ludicrous, but rather the special aspect which earnestness assumes  in his case, and, in short, a certain eccentricity that mars it in our  eyes. Agreed; but it is none the less true that this eccentricity in  Alceste, at which we laugh, MAKES HIS EARNESTNESS LAUGHABLE, and that  is the main point. So we may conclude that the ludicrous is not always  an indication of a fault, in the moral meaning of the word, and if  critics insist on seeing a fault, even though a trifling one, in the  ludicrous, they must point out what it is here that exactly  distinguishes the trifling from the serious.    The truth is, the comic character may, strictly speaking, be quite in  accord with stern morality. All it has to do is to bring itself into  accord with society. The character of Alceste is that of a thoroughly  honest man. But then he is unsociable,"]]]
