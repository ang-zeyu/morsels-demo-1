[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558"],[0,"Barry Lyndon (#16)"],[1,"I heard  afterwards that my champion had taken Mr. Fakenham very severely to  task for this threat, and said to him that any such proceedings for the  future he should consider as an insult to himself; whereon the young  ensign was, for the moment, civil. As for the sergeants, I told one of  them, that if any man struck me, no matter who he might be, or what  the penalty, I would take his life. And, 'faith! there was an air of  sincerity in my speech which convinced the whole bevy of them; and as  long as I remained in the English service no rattan was ever laid on the  shoulders of Redmond Barry. Indeed, I was in that savage moody state,  that my mind was quite made up to the point, and I looked to hear my own  dead march played as sure as I was alive. When I was made a corporal,  some of my evils were lessened; I messed with the sergeants by special  favour, and used to treat them to drink, and lose money to the rascals  at play: with which cash my good friend Mr. Fagan punctually supplied  me.    Our regiment, which was quartered about Stade and Luneburg, speedily  got orders to march southwards towards the Rhine, for news came that our  great General, Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, had been defeated--no, not  defeated, but foiled in his attack upon the French under the Duke of  Broglio, at Bergen, near Frankfort-on-the-Main, and had been obliged to  fall back. As the allies retreated the French rushed forward, and made  a bold push for the Electorate of our gracious monarch in Hanover,  threatening that they would occupy it; as they had done before, when  D'Estrees beat the hero of Culloden, the gallant Duke of Cumberland, and  caused him to sign the capitulation of Closter Zeven. An advance upon  Hanover always caused a great agitation in the Royal bosom of the King  of England; more troops were sent to join us, convoys of treasure were  passed over to our forces, and to our ally's the King of Prussia; and  although, in spite of all assistance, the army under Prince Ferdinand  was very much weaker than that of the invading enemy, yet we had the  advantage of better supplies, one of the greatest Generals in the world:  and, I was going to add, of British valour, but the less we say about  THAT the better. My Lord George Sackville did not exactly cover himself  with laurels at Minden; otherwise there might have been won there one of  the greatest victories of modern times.    Throwing himself between the French and the interior of the Electorate,  Prince Ferdinand wisely took possession of the free town of Bremen,  which he made his storehouse and place of arms; and round which he  gathered all his troops, making ready to fight the famous battle of  Minden.    Were these Memoirs not characterised by truth, and did I deign to utter  a single word for which my own personal experience did not give me the  fullest authority, I might easily make myself the hero of some strange  and popular adventures, and, after the fashion of novel-writers,  introduce my reader to the great characters of this remarkable time.  These persons (I mean the romance-writers), if they take a drummer or  a dustman for a hero, somehow manage to bring him in contact with  the greatest lords and most notorious personages of the empire; and  I warrant me there's not one of them but, in describing the battle  of Minden, would manage to bring Prince Ferdinand, and my Lord George  Sackville, and my Lord Granby, into presence. It would have been easy  for me to have SAID I was present when the orders were brought to Lord  George to charge with the cavalry and finish the rout of the Frenchmen,  and when he refused to do so, and thereby spoiled the great victory. But  the fact is, I was two miles off from the cavalry when his Lordship's  fatal hesitation took place, and none of us soldiers of the line knew of  what had occurred until we came to talk about the fight over our kettles  in the evening, and repose after the labours of a hard-fought day. I saw  no one of higher rank that day than my colonel and a couple of orderly  officers riding by in the smoke--no one on our side, that is. A poor  corporal (as I then had the disgrace of being) is not generally invited  into the company of commanders and the great; but, in revenge, I saw,  I promise you, some very good company on the FRENCH part, for their  regiments of Lorraine and Royal Cravate were charging us all day; and  in THAT sort of MELEE high and low are pretty equally received. I hate  bragging, but I cannot help saying that I made a very close acquaintance  with the colonel of the Cravates; for I drove my bayonet into his body,  and finished off a poor little ensign, so young, slender, and small,  that a blow from my pigtail would have despatched him, I think, in  place of the butt of my musket, with which I clubbed him down. I killed,  besides, four more officers and men, and in the poor ensign's pocket  found a purse of fourteen louis-d'or, and a silver box of sugar-plums;  of which the former present was very agreeable to me. If people would  tell their stories of battles in this simple way, I think the cause of  truth would not suffer by it. All I know of this famous fight of Minden  (except from books) is told here above. The ensign's silver bon-bon box  and his purse of gold; the livid face of the poor fellow as he fell;  the huzzas of the men of my company as I went out under a smart fire  and rifled him; their shouts and curses as we came hand in hand with the  Frenchmen,--these are, in truth, not very dignified recollections, and  had best be passed over briefly. When my kind friend Fagan was shot, a  brother captain, and his very good friend, turned to Lieutenant Rawson  and said, 'Fagan's down; Rawson, there's your company.' It was all the  epitaph my brave patron got. 'I should have left you a hundred guineas,  Redmond,' were his last words to me, 'but for a cursed run of ill luck  last night at faro.' And he gave me a faint squeeze of the hand; then,  as the word was given to advance, I left him. When we came back to our  old ground, which we presently did, he was lying there still; but he  was dead. Some of our people had already torn off his epaulets, and,  no doubt, had rifled his purse. Such knaves and ruffians do men in war  become! It is well for gentlemen to talk of the age of chivalry; but  remember the starving brutes whom they lead--men nursed in poverty,  entirely ignorant, made to take a pride in deeds of blood--men who can  have no amusement but in drunkenness, debauch, and plunder. It is with  these shocking instruments that your great warriors and kings have been  doing their murderous work in the world; and while, for instance, we are  at the present moment admiring the 'Great Frederick,' as we call him,  and his philosophy, and his liberality, and his military genius, I, who  have served him, and been, as it were, behind the scenes of which that  great spectacle is composed, can only look at it with horror. What  a number of items of human crime, misery, slavery, go to form that  sum-total of glory! I can recollect a certain day about three weeks  after the battle of Minden, and a farmhouse in which some of us entered;  and how the old woman and her daughters served us, trembling, to wine;  and how we got drunk over the wine, and the house was in a flame,  presently; and woe betide the wretched fellow afterwards who came home  to look for his house and his children!          CHAPTER V. BARRY FAR FROM MILITARY GLORY    After the death of my protector, Captain Fagan, I am forced to confess  that I fell into the very worst of courses and company. Being a rough  soldier of fortune himself, he had never been a favourite with the  officers of his regiment; who had a contempt for Irishmen, as Englishmen  sometimes will have, and used to mock his brogue, and his blunt uncouth  manners. I had been insolent to one or two of them, and had only been  screened from punishment by his intercession; especially his successor,  Mr. Rawson, had no liking for me, and put another man into the  sergeant's place vacant in his company after the battle of Minden.  This act of injustice rendered my service very disagreeable to me; and,  instead of seeking to conquer the dislike of my superiors, and win their  goodwill by good behaviour, I only sought for means to make my situation  easier to me, and grasped at all the amusements in my power. In a  foreign country, with the enemy before us, and the people continually  under contribution from one side or the other, numberless irregularities  were permitted to the troops which would not have been allowed in more  peaceable times. I descended gradually to mix with the sergeants, and to  share their amusements: drinking and gambling were, I am sorry to say,  our principal pastimes; and I fell so readily into their ways, that  though only a young lad of seventeen, I was the master of them all in  daring wickedness; though there were some among them who, I promise you,  were far advanced in the science of every kind of profligacy. I should  have been under the provost-marshal's hands, for a dead certainty, had  I continued much longer in the army: but an accident occurred which took  me out of the English service in rather a singular manner.    The year in which George II died, our regiment had the honour to be  present at the battle of Warburg (where the Marquis of Granby and his  horse fully retrieved the discredit which had fallen upon the cavalry  since Lord George Sackville's defalcation at Minden), and where Prince  Ferdinand once more completely defeated the Frenchmen. During the  action, my lieutenant, Mr. Fakenham, of Fakenham, the gentleman who had  threatened me, it may be remembered, with the caning, was struck by a  musket-ball in the side. He had shown no want of courage in this or any  other occasion where he had been called upon to act against the French;  but this was his first wound, and the young gentleman was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45619"],[0,"History of the Prophet Joseph, (#16)"],[1,"the year previous; and supposing at this  time that the only thing required, in order to possess them until the  time for their translation, was to be able to keep the commandments  of God--and he firmly believed he could keep every commandment which  had been given him--he fully expected to carry them home with him.  Therefore, having arrived at the place, and uncovering the plates, he  put forth his hand and took them up, but, as he was taking them hence,  the unhappy thought darted through his mind that probably there was  something else in the box besides the plates, which would be of some  pecuniary advantage to him. So, in the moment of excitement, he laid  them down very carefully, for the purpose of covering the box, lest  some one might happen to pass that way and get whatever there might be  remaining in it. After covering it, he turned round to take the Record  again, but behold it was gone, and where, he knew not, neither did he  know the means by which it had been taken from him.    At this, as a natural consequence, he was much alarmed. He kneeled down  and asked the Lord why the Record had been taken from him; upon which  the angel of the Lord appeared to him, and told him that he had not  done as he had been commanded, for in a former revelation he had been  commanded not to lay the plates down, or put them for a moment out of  his hands, until he got into the house and deposited them in a chest or  trunk, having a good lock and key, and, contrary to this, he had laid  them down with the view of securing some fancied or imaginary treasure  that remained.    In the moment of excitement, Joseph was overcome by the powers of  darkness, and forgot the injunction that was laid upon him.    Having some further conversation with the angel, on this occasion,  Joseph was permitted to raise the stone again, when he beheld the  plates as he had done before. He immediately reached forth his hand  to take them, but instead of getting them, as he anticipated, he was  hurled back upon the ground with great violence. When he recovered, the  angel was gone, and he arose and returned to the house, weeping for  grief and disappointment.    As he was aware that we would expect him to bring the plates home with  him, he was greatly troubled, fearing that we might doubt his having  seen them. As soon as he entered the house, my husband asked him if he  had obtained the plates. The answer was, \"No, father, I could not get  them.\"    His father then said, \"Did you see them?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Joseph, \"I saw them, but could not take them.\"    \"I would have taken them,\" rejoined his father, with much earnestness,  \"if I had been in your place.\"    \"Why,\" returned Joseph, in quite a subdued tone, \"you do not know what  you say. I could not get them, for the angel of the Lord would not let  me.\"    Joseph then related the circumstance in full, which gave us much  uneasiness, as we were afraid that he might utterly fail of obtaining  the Record through some neglect on his part. We, therefore, doubled our  diligence in prayer and supplication to God, in order that he might be  more fully instructed in his duty, and be preserved from all the wiles  and machinations of him \"who lieth in wait to deceive.\"    We were still making arrangements to build us a comfortable house, the  management and control of which devolved chiefly upon Alvin. And when  November, 1824, arrived, the frame was raised, and all the materials  necessary for its speedy completion were procured. This opened to  Alvin's mind the pleasing prospect of seeing his father and mother once  more comfortable and happy. He would say, \"I am going to have a nice,  pleasant room for father and mother to sit in, and everything arranged  for their comfort, and they shall not work any more as they have done.\"        CHAPTER XX.    ALVIN'S SICKNESS AND DEATH.    On the 15th of November, 1824, about 10 o'clock in the morning,  Alvin was taken very sick with the bilious colic. He came to the  house in much distress, and requested his father to go immediately  for a physician. He accordingly went, obtaining one by the name of  Greenwood, who, on arriving, immediately administered to the patient  a heavy dose of calomel. I will here notice, that this Dr. Greenwood  was not the physician commonly employed by the family; he was brought  in consequence of the family physician's absence. And on this account,  as I suppose, Alvin at first refused to take the medicine, but by much  persuasion, he was prevailed on to do so.    This dose of calomel lodged in his stomach, and all the medicine  afterwards freely administered by four very skillful physicians could  not remove it.    On the third day of his sickness, Dr. M'Intyre, whose services were  usually employed by the family, as he was considered very skillful, was  brought, and with him four other eminent physicians. But it was all in  vain, their exertions proved unavailing, just as Alvin had said would  be the case--he told them the calomel was still lodged in the same  place, after some exertion had been made to carry it off, and that it  must take his life.    On coming to this conclusion, he called Hyrum to him, and said, \"Hyrum,  I must die. Now I want to say a few things, which I wish to have you  remember. I have done all I could to make our dear parents comfortable.  I want you to go on and finish the house and take care of them in their  old age, and do not any more let them work hard, as they are now in old  age.\"    He then called Sophronia to him, and said to her, \"Sophronia, you must  be a good girl, and do all you can for father and mother--never forsake  them; they have worked hard, and they are now getting old. Be kind to  them, and remember what they have done for us.\"    In the latter part of the fourth night he called for all the children,  and exhorted them separately in the same strain as above. But when he  came to Joseph, he said, \"I am now going to die, the distress which I  suffer, and the feelings that I have, tell me my time is very short. I  want you to be a good boy, and do everything that lies in your power to  obtain the Record. Be faithful in receiving instruction, and in keeping  every commandment that is given you. Your brother Alvin must leave you;  but remember the example which he has set for you; and set the same  example for the children that are younger than yourself, and always be  kind to father and mother.\"    He then asked me to take my little daughter Lucy up, and bring her to  him, for he wished to see her. He was always very fond of her, and was  in the habit of taking her up and caressing her, which naturally formed  a very strong attachment on her part for him. I went to her, and said;  \"Lucy, Alvin wants to see you.\" At this, she started from her sleep,  and screamed out, \"Amby, Amby;\" (she could not yet talk plain, being  very young). We took her to him, and when she got within reach of him,  she sprang from my arms and caught him around the neck, and cried out,  \"Oh! Amby,\" and kissed him again and again.    \"Lucy,\" said he, \"you must be the best girl in the world, and take  care of mother; you can't have your Amby any more. Amby is going away;  he must leave little Lucy.\" He then kissed her, and said, \"take her  away, I think my breath offends her.\" We took hold of her to take her  away; but she clinched him with such a strong grasp, that it was with  difficulty we succeeded in disengaging her hands.    As I turned with the child to leave him, he said, \"Father, mother,  brothers, and sisters, farewell! I can now breathe out my life as  calmly as a clock.\" Saying this, he immediately closed his eyes in  death.    The child still cried to go back to Alvin. One present observed to  the child, \"Alvin is gone; an angel has taken his spirit to heaven.\"  Hearing this, the child renewed her cries, and, as I bent over his  corpse with her in my arms, she again threw her arms around him, and  kissed him repeatedly. And until the body was taken from the house she  continued to cry, and to manifest such mingled feelings of both terror  and affection at the scene before her, as are seldom witnessed.    Alvin was a youth of singular goodness of disposition--kind and  amiable, so that lamentation and mourning filled the whole neighborhood  in which he resided.    By the request of the principal physician, Alvin was cut open, in order  to discover, if it were possible, the cause of his death. On doing  so, they found the calomel lodged in the upper bowels, untouched by  anything which he had taken to remove it, and as near as possible in  its natural state, surrounded as it was with gangrene.    A vast concourse of people attended his obsequies, who seemed very  anxious to show their sympathy for us in our bereavement.    Alvin manifested, if such could be the case, greater zeal and anxiety  in regard to the Record that had been shown to Joseph, than any of the  rest of the family; in consequence of which we could not bear to hear  anything said upon the subject. Whenever Joseph spoke of the Record,  it would immediately bring Alvin to our minds, with all his zeal, and  with all' his kindness; and, when we looked to his place, and realized  that he was gone from it, to return no more in this life, we all with  one accord wept over our irretrievable loss, and we could \"not be  comforted, because he was not.\"        CHAPTER XXI.    RELIGIOUS EXCITEMENT--JOSEPH'S PROPHECY--HE WORKS FOR MR.  STOAL--BECOMES ACQUAINTED WITH EMMA HALE.    Shortly after the death of Alvin, a man commenced laboring in the  neighborhood, to effect a union of the different churches, in order  that all might be agreed, and thus worship God with one heart and with  one mind.    This seemed about right to me, and I felt much inclined to join in with  them; in fact, the most of the family appeared quite disposed to unite  with their numbers; but Joseph, from the first, utterly refused even to  attend their meetings,"]]]
