PLASTIC EXPRESSION=]    The exercises already dealt with have all the general purpose of  developing feeling for rhythm by giving training in the physical  expression of rhythms. Those in this last group aim at facility in  making crescendos and decrescendos of innervation, in passing from one  shade of expression to another, in co-ordinating movements, not only to  the rhythm of the music played, but also to its feeling; they allow free  play to individuality, to temperament, and give opportunity for that  free self-expression for which the preceding exercises have provided  facility.    PERCY B. INGHAM.          LESSONS AT HELLERAU      Monsieur Jaques-Dalcroze's lessons are full of vitality and  entertainment, combined with the serious work in hand. No slacking is  possible. He will perhaps open a rhythmic gymnastic lesson by playing a  vigorous theme of one or two bars in a rhythm such as the following:--    {Music}    which, as soon as it is grasped by the pupils, they begin to  _realize_,[1] that is, to mark the tempo with the arms, and to move the  feet according to the notes. A note which contains more than one  beat--for instance, the minim in the first bar--is shown by taking  one step forward for the first beat and by a slight bend of the knee for  the second beat. The next two crochets are represented by one step for  each. A step is also taken for each quaver, but twice as quickly; for  the dotted crochet, a step and a slight spring before the last  quaver--all this while the arms are beating a steady four. After a short  practice of these two bars, the master will glide into yet another  rhythm, the pupils still realizing the first one, but at the same time  listening and mentally registering the one being played, so as to be  ready on the instant at the word of command, which is _hopp_, to change  to the new rhythm. We will suppose it to be as follows {Music}. This, it  will be noticed, is in 3/4 time. The pupils become accustomed to  dropping frequently into various times with the greatest ease. The three  bars would then be realized consecutively, and this process will  continue until perhaps there are six bars in all. These must all be so  clear in the minds of the pupils, that at the word of command, one bar,  or two bars, can be omitted on the instant, or be realized twice as  quickly, or twice as slowly; or what is still more complicated, the arms  can beat the time twice as slowly and the feet mark the notes twice as  quickly. It seems incredibly difficult to do at first, but the same  training of _thinking to time_ occurs in every lesson, in improvisation  and solfege, as well as in the rhythmic gymnastic lessons, and so the  invaluable habits of concentrated thinking, of quick and definite  action, and of control of mind over body, become established.        [1] See note, page 41        [Illustration: The Air Bath.]        [Illustration: The College: Entrance Hall.]    Each lesson is varied to a remarkable degree; in fact, Monsieur  Jaques-Dalcroze seldom repeats himself. Every day he has new ideas,  consisting of new movements, or of new uses for old ones, so that there  is never a dull moment. It must be understood, however, that the  alphabet and grammar of the movements remain the same, it is the  combinations of them that are limitless. The music is, of course, always  improvised.    A word should be said on the subject of feeling two different rhythms at  the same time. Every teacher knows the difficulty children have in  playing three notes against four on the piano. The Hellerau children can  with ease beat four with one arm and three with the other, or beat three  with the arms and two or four with the feet, or _vice versa_. And this  is not learnt in any mechanical way; the power for _feeling_ two rhythms  simultaneously is developed. Advanced pupils can realize three rhythms  at the same time. They will perhaps mark one with the arms, another with  the feet, and sing yet a third.    Another part of the work is to teach the pupils to express the type of  music that is being played; this is technically known as \"Plastic  expression.\" The alphabet of this consists of twenty gestures with the  arms, which can be done in many various combinations and in various  positions, and by means of these any kind of emotion can be expressed.  Perhaps the music will begin by being solemn and grand, becoming even  tragic, and gradually the tones and melody will rise to cheerfulness,  the rhythm will become more animated and the tone swell out again until  a perfect ecstasy of joy is reached--and all the while the figures of  the pupils are harmonising absolutely with the music, trained as they  are to listen accurately to every note, every accent, every change of  key and, above all, every rhythm. To the watcher such an exercise is  effective and striking in the highest degree.    Realizing syncopated passages is a fine exercise for developing  independence of movement in the arms and feet, as the feet move in  between the beats of the arms. Let any one try to realize a simple  measure in syncopation. For instance, take a bar of 4/4 time {Music}.  The first beat of the arms and the first step will come together, the  second beat of the arms will come half-way between the second and third  steps, the third beat half-way between the third and fourth steps, and  the fourth beat half-way between the fourth and fifth steps, and this  should be done with no contraction of muscle or appearance of effort.    Other exercises consist of beating various times in canon, that is, one  arm beginning one beat later than the other; of beating different times  with each arm, perhaps seven with one arm and three with the other; of  marching to one rhythm and beating time to another; of simple marching  and at the word of command taking one step backward, and then forward  again; of marching the counterpoint of a rhythm. For instance, if the  rhythm played be {Music} the counterpoint in crochets would be {Music},  or if it is to be in quavers it would be {Music}. The counterpoint can  be filled in with triplets, semiquavers, or with notes of any other  value.    Another good exercise is to take a simple rhythm and at the word of  command realize it twice or three times as quickly or as slowly, the  arms still beating in the first tempo. A simple example will make this  clear. {Music} twice as quickly would become {Music}.    The pupils are often asked to listen to what is played and then to  realize it. It may be a series of four bars, each one in a different  tempo, and all times are employed, including 5/4, 7/4, 9/3 and  others which are somewhat exceptional. And so on _ad infinitum_.    From these suggestions something of the endless variety of exercises  that may be devised can probably now be imagined.    As soon as movements become automatic they are used as units for  building up more elaborate movements, and no time is wasted in doing  merely mechanical exercises. In every detail of the method the brain is  called into constant activity, and, lest any one should think that it  would be easy for one pupil to copy another in doing the exercises, it  should be stated that, if such a thing were attempted, it would end in  the pupil becoming hopelessly confused, for if the mind once loses hold  of the work in process it is very difficult to pick it up again.    The solfege lessons are chiefly for ear-training and practical harmony.  In the elementary classes it is shown how scales and chords are formed,  and where the tones and semitones occur. The pupils soon become able  to tell, when three consecutive notes from any scale are played, what  degrees of the scale they are, or may be. Scales are sung always  beginning on C for every key and always to a rhythm. Here, again, the  pupils have to think to time, for in the second scale, which would be  that of F, if the flat scales were being sung, they have to remember  that they are starting on the fifth note of the scale, and that the  interval between the third and fourth notes of the scale is a semitone;  that the third and fourth degrees in the key of F are A and B, and  therefore the B has to be flattened in this scale, the other notes  remaining the same. The whole cycle of scales is sung in this manner,  each one commencing on C, or on C flat when necessary. The pupils are  also practised in listening to a scale played and then saying in which  key it is, judging it by the fall of the semitones.        [Illustration: Class Rooms.]        [Illustration: The College: Interiors.]    Chords are sung analytically and in chorus, with their resolutions when  needed, and this is followed by practice in hearing and naming chords.    Sight singing and transposition are by no means neglected, and there is  practice in singing intervals, in singing a piece once or twice through  and then from memory, or in another key, which is not so easy to do when  the fixed _Do_ is used. And always, whatever is being done, the pupils  have to be prepared for the word _hopp_, to make any change which has  been previously agreed on, e.g., to sing on the instant in a key a  semitone lower, or to sing in thought only until the next _hopp_, when  they sing aloud again. In these exercises, as in those of the rhythmic  gymnastics, there is no end of the variety of combination possible.  There is also opportunity for practice in conducting, and very  interesting it is, in a children's class, to note with what assurance a  small girl of perhaps seven or eight will beat time for the others to  sing one of their songs, and also to note the various renderings each  conductor will obtain of the same piece.    The improvisation on the piano is perhaps the most difficult part of the  system to master. It may not be realized by all people that _every one  can be taught to play original music_. There are cases in which the  pupil is not naturally musical,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21654"],[0,"In and Around Berlin (#7)"],[1," the study-table of my own room while I needed  them. The department of Scandinavian travel was, however, much more  scantily represented than Russia. Long shall I have reason to remember  with gratitude the generous \"open sesame\" and the rich privileges of  this library, which, more than most things that enjoy the epithet,  truly deserves the name Royal.    As no woman can enter the Berlin University as a student, neither is  it practicable for a lady, either as student or visitor, to find  access to the _Gymnasia_, which, in the German sense of this term, are  somewhat in the line of our American colleges. My windows looked into  those of a fine new building across the street, devoted to the  instruction of German youth. In through its doors there filed, every  week-day morning, long lines of German boys and young men for the  various grades of instruction; and a natural desire arose in the mind  of an old teacher to \"visit the school.\" But on application to an  influential friend long resident in Germany, for a note of  introduction to the Director of the _Gymnasium_, his hands were lifted  in unaffected astonishment at the nature of the request, \"A woman in a  boys' school! oh, never! Ask me any other favor but that! Oh, it is  _impossible_!\" A German lady was more hopeful. She was intimate with  the wife of the Director, and thought she could gain for me the  coveted permission. But weeks lengthened into months, and still the  right to enter even the enclosure sacred to the education of German  boys was not obtained. So I studied the educational system at first on  paper, and found many facts of interest. Attendance at the common  schools is compulsory, all children of both sexes being required to  attend, in separate buildings, from the ages of five to fourteen.  Beyond this, the High School offers a training for practical life and  business, and the _Gymnasium_ a classical and scientific training  leading to the special studies of the University. The course of study  in the _Gymnasia_ is similar to those of our colleges, some of the  studies of the latter, however, being relegated to the University. A  boy at nine years of age enters the _Gymnasium_ for a course of nine  years, in which Latin and Greek receive the chief emphasis. The same  great division of opinion as to the comparative merits of linguistic  and scientific training which exists in the rest of the world,  agitates the German mind. The _Gymnasium_ with its classical training  is the child of the present century, and its growth all along has been  disputed by those who claim greater advantages from a curriculum which  lays chief stress on science, omitting the Greek and half the Latin,  for a part of which modern languages are substituted. This has given  rise to what are called the Real Schools, corresponding to our  Scientific Schools. These receive their inspiration from the people  rather than the learned classes, and are regarded as still on trial.  Meantime, until quite recently, the graduates of the _Gymnasia_ have  had a monopoly of competition for positions as teachers and  opportunity to practise the learned professions. A recent change  allows graduates of the Real Schools to compete for teacherships. The  graduates of _Gymnasia_ only are allowed to enter the professions of  Medicine and Law. The Prussian _Gymnasia_ are about two hundred and  fifty in number, and the Real Schools somewhat over one hundred. In  point of military service, these schools are all on an equal footing,  a pupil who completes a course of six years in either being obliged to  serve but one year with the colors. It is said that a large number of  those who graduate in these schools do so for the sake of thus  shortening their term of military service. I was present at an evening  entertainment offered by the older students of one _Gymnasium_ to the  friends of the school. It was a rendering, in Greek, of the Antigone  of Sophocles, with considerable adjuncts of scenery, costume, and  Greek chorus. A brief outline of the play in German was distributed to  the audience. For the rest, a knowledge of Greek was the only key to  what was said by experts to be well done.    But if this one personal glimpse of the scholarship of the higher  schools for boys was all that could be obtained, I was more fortunate  in finding access to the schools for girls. Not, however, without  painstaking. It is by no means a matter of course for any visitor to  knock at the door of a school-room for a call upon the school. The  coming of visitors is uniformly discouraged; the teachers saying that  the pupils are not used to it, and that their attention is thereby  diverted from their studies. A lady of my acquaintance, resident for  some years in Berlin, asked permission to visit the school which her  little daughter attended, and was refused. A professional educator  from abroad, especially a gentleman, if properly introduced, will find  little difficulty in obtaining access to the schools; but a lady, who  wishes to go unofficially, will need persistence and courage before  she effects her object.    A friendly acquaintance with two German teachers smoothed the way,  perhaps opened it, to a privilege I had hitherto sought in vain. At  supper one evening I made an engagement to meet one of these ladies in  the school to which she belonged, early the next morning. In the short  Berlin days of mid-winter one must rise by candle-light to be in time  for even the second hour of school, if living a half-hour distant. In  one of the largest hotels of Berlin I saw, the week before Christmas,  a little fellow, scarcely tall enough for seven years, departing for  school in the morning, with his knapsack on his back, an hour before  there would be daylight enough for him to study by. As he sturdily  went forth from the elegant rooms and brilliantly lighted corridors  into the cold gray dawn and the snowy streets towards the distant  school, I said, \"There is the way to train Spartans!\" The schools  begin at eight o'clock for girls, at seven for boys, though many go at  later hours. Those who are not able to pay for instruction attend the  \"common schools,\" where tuition is free; but those who can must pay at  the rate of from about five to seven dollars per quarter, in the  schools denominated \"public.\"    The school to which I went occupies a handsome modern brick edifice,  and accommodates eight hundred girls. It was ten o'clock, when the  recess which follows the stroke of each hour (ten minutes) is doubled,  in order to give time for the \"second breakfast\"--bread and butter  taken in basket or bag--by both teachers and pupils, to supplement  the rolls and coffee partaken of by candle-light in winter, which form  the first breakfast. The teacher whom I knew was waiting for me in the  corridor, where the busy hum of hundreds of young voices filled the  air. Handsome and substantial stone staircases fill the central  portion of the edifice, lighted by a skylight, by windows where a  transverse corridor reaches to the street, and by ground glass in the  double doors leading to some of the class-rooms. It was a dark  morning, and so the corridors were dim enough. Most of the pupils are  in school from eight to one o'clock. Some of the younger ones come at  nine, or even ten, and go home at twelve. I was told that instruction  as to what to do in case of fire in the building is carefully given,  but saw no fire-escapes, except the stairways. There was provision for  ventilation in the class-rooms,--a register near the floor admitting  pure warm air, and another near the ceiling giving exit to impure air.  But this mode was quite insufficient to secure good air in most of the  rooms. I was conducted to the Director of the school, without whose  permission I could not enter. He was standing in the corridor on the  third floor, surrounded by several girls, with whom he was talking in  the manner of a _paterfamilias_,--an aged man, with a shrewd but  kindly face. I was introduced, and the object of my visit stated.  Bowing and leading the way to his office, he made a slight demurrer as  to the profit I should reap, but freely accorded the permission, after  making an entry, apparently from my visiting-card, in his register. My  friend again took me in charge, and conducted me to another room,  where I was introduced to the \"first instructress,\" and to five or six  other lady teachers, all of whom sat, in wooden chairs, around a plain  wooden table, partaking of their luncheon. Two or three good  photographs--one of the Roman forum--were in frames on the walls; a  large mirror and a set of lock-boxes gave the teachers toilet  accommodations; while baskets of knitting and other belongings bespoke  this as the retiring-room of the lady teachers. The chief of these, a  kind-faced matronly woman, spoke English imperfectly; but several of  the younger ones spoke it very well, and one or two were of charming  manners and appearance.    From a schedule hanging on the wall, I was shown the names and number  of recitations for the day. \"What would I like to see? How long can I  remain? Will I come again to-morrow?\" If the permission to visit a  school be often difficult to gain, once received, it covers every  recitation, and as many hours or days as the visitor chooses to devote  to it. I was first conducted to a recitation in arithmetic. The room  contained accommodations for fifty pupils, and the seats were filled  by girls about thirteen or fourteen years of age. Wooden desks and  seats (the outer row for three pupils each, the central for four  each), a slightly raised platform for the teacher, with a plain desk  and two chairs, several cases of butterflies and beetles, on the walls  a map or two, a small blackboard behind the teacher's desk, in  grooves, so that it may be elevated or lowered at pleasure, make up  the furniture of the room. The light, as in every room I visited, was  from one side,"]]]
