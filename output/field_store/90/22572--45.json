My father still found  difficulties, which my all-wise Creator raised for my salvation. Had I  married any of these persons, I should have been much exposed, and my  vanity would have had means to extend itself.    There was one person who had asked for me in marriage for several  years. My father, for family reasons, had always refused him. His  manners were opposite to my vanity. A fear lest I should leave my  country, together with the affluent circumstances of this gentleman,  induced my father, in spite of both his own and my mother's reluctance,  to promise me to him. This was done without consulting me. They made me  sign the marriage articles without letting me know what they were. I  was well pleased with the thoughts of marriage, flattering myself with  a hope of being thereby set at full liberty, and delivered from the  ill-treatment of my mother which I drew upon myself. God ordered it far  otherwise. The condition which I found myself in afterward, frustrated  my hopes.    Pleasing as marriage was to my thoughts, I was all the time, after my  being promised, and even long after my marriage, in extreme confusion,  which arose from two causes. First, my natural modesty, which I did not  lose. I had much reserve toward men. The other, my vanity. Though the  husband provided was a more advantageous match than I merited, yet I  did not think him such. The figure which the others made, who had  offered to me before, was vastly more engaging. Their rank would have  placed me in view. Whatever did not flatter my vanity, was to me  insupportable. Yet this very vanity was, I think, of some advantage; it  hindered me from falling into such things as cause the ruin of  families. I would not do anything which in the eye of the world, might  render me culpable. As I was modest at church and had not been used to  go abroad without my mother, as the reputation of our house was great,  I passed for virtuous.    I did not see my spouse elect (at Paris) till two or three days before  our marriage. I caused masses to be said all the time after my being  contracted, to know the will of God. I wished to do it in this affair  at least.    Oh, my God, how great was thy goodness, to bear with me at this time,  and to allow me to pray to Thee with as much boldness, as if I had been  one of thy friends, I who had rebelled against Thee as thy greatest  enemy.    The joy of our nuptials was universal through our village. Amid this  general rejoicing, there appeared none sad but myself. I could neither  laugh as others did, nor even eat; so much was I depressed. I knew not  the cause. It was a foretaste which God gave me of what was to befall  me. The remembrance of the desire I had of being a nun, came pouring  in. All who came to compliment me, the day after, could not forbear  rallying me. I wept bitterly. I answered, \"Alas! I had desired so much  to be a nun; why then am I now married? By what fatality has such a  revolution befallen me?\" No sooner was I at the house of my new spouse,  than I perceived that it would be for me a house of mourning.    I was obliged to change my conduct. Their manner of living was very  different from that in my father's house. My mother-in-law, who had  long been a widow, regarded nothing else but economy. At my father's  house they lived in a noble manner and great elegance. What my husband  and mother-in-law called pride, and I called politeness, was observed  there. I was very much surprised at this change, and so much the more,  as my vanity wished to increase, rather than to be diminished.    At the time of my marriage I was a little past fifteen years of age. My  surprise increased greatly, when I saw I must lose what I had acquired  with so much application. At my father's house we were obliged to  behave in a genteel way, and to speak with propriety. All that I said  was applauded. Here they never hearkened to me, but to contradict and  find fault. If I spoke well, they said it was to give them a lesson. If  any questions were started at my father's, he encouraged me to speak  freely. Here, if I spoke my sentiments, they said it was to enter into  a dispute. They put me to silence in an abrupt and shameful manner, and  scolded me from morning till night.    I should have some difficulty to give you an account, which cannot be  done without wounding charity, if you had not forbidden me to omit any  one. I request you not to look at things on the side of the creature,  which would make these persons appear worse than they were. My  mother-in-law had virtue, my husband had religion, and not any vice. It  is requisite to look at everything on the side of God. He permitted  these things only for my salvation, and because He would not have me  lost. I had beside so much pride, that had I received any other  treatment, I should have continued therein, and should not, perhaps,  have turned to God as I was induced to do, by the oppression of a  multitude of crosses.    My mother-in-law conceived such a desire to oppose me in everything,  that, in order to vex me, she made me perform the most humiliating  offices. Her disposition was so extraordinary, having never surmounted  it in her youth, that she could hardly live with anybody. Saying none  than vocal prayers, she did not see this fault; or seeing it, and not  drawing from the forces of prayer, she could not get the better of it.  It was a pity, for she had both sense and merit. I was made the victim  of her humors. All her occupation was to thwart me and she inspired the  like sentiments in her son. They would make persons my inferiors take  place above me. My mother, who had a high sense of honor, could not  endure that. When she heard it from others (for I told her nothing) she  chided me thinking I did it because I did not know how to keep my rank  and had no spirit. I dared not tell her how it was; but I was almost  ready to die with the agonies of grief and continual vexation. What  aggravated all was the remembrance of the persons who had proposed for  me, the difference of their dispositions and manners, the love they had  for me, with their agreeableness and politeness. All this made my  burden intolerable. My mother-in-law upbraided me in regard to my  family, and spoke to me incessantly to the disadvantage of my father  and mother. I never went to see them, but I had some bitter speeches to  bear on my return.    My mother complained that I did not come often enough to see her. She  said I did not love her, that I was alienated from my family by being  too much attached to my husband.    What augmented my crosses was that my mother related to my  mother-in-law the pains I had cost her from infancy. They then  reproached me, saying, I was a changeling, and an evil spirit. My  husband obliged me to stay all day long in my mother-in-law's room,  without any liberty of retiring into my own apartment. She spoke  disadvantageously of me, to lessen the affection and esteem which some  had entertained for me. She galled me with the grossest affronts before  the finest company. This did not have the effect she wanted; the more  patiently they saw me bear it, the higher esteem they had for me.    She found the secret of extinguishing my vivacity, and rendering me  stupid. Some of my former acquaintances hardly knew me. Those who had  not seen me before said, \"Is this the person famed for such abundance  of wit? She can't say two words. She is a fine picture.\" I was not yet  sixteen years old. I was so much intimidated, that I dared not go out  without my mother-in-law, and in her presence I could not speak. I knew  not what I said; so much fear had I.    To complete my affliction, they presented me with a waiting-maid who  was everything with them. She kept me in sight like a governess. For  the most part I bore with patience these evils which I had no way to  avoid. But sometimes I let some hasty answer escape me, a source of  grievous crosses to me. When I went out, the footmen had orders to give  an account of everything I did. It was then I began to eat the bread of  sorrows, and to mingle tears with my drink. At the table they always  did something which covered me with confusion. I could not forbear  tears. I had no one to confide in who might share my affliction, and  assist me to bear it. When I would impart some hint of it to my mother,  I drew upon myself new crosses. I resolved to have no confidant. It was  not from any natural cruelty that my husband treated me thus; he loved  me passionately, but he was warm and hasty, and my mother-in-law  continually irritated him about me.    It was in a condition so deplorable, O my God, that I began to perceive  the need I had of Thy assistance. For this situation was perilous for  me. I met with none but admirers abroad, those that flattered me to my  hurt. It were to be feared lest at such a tender age, amid all the  strange domestic crosses I had to bear, I might be drawn away. But  Thou, by Thy goodness and love, gave it quite another turn. By these  redoubled strokes Thou didst draw me to Thyself, and by Thy crosses  effected what Thy caresses could not effect. Nay, Thou madest use of my  natural pride, to keep me within the limits of my duty. I knew that a  woman of honor ought never to give suspicion to her husband. I was so  very circumspect that I often carried it to excess, so far as to refuse  my hand to such as in politeness offered me theirs. There happened to  me an adventure which, by carrying my prudence too far, might have  ruined me, for things were taken contrary to their intent. My husband  was sensible both of my innocence and of the falsehood of the  insinuations of my mother-in-law.    Such weighty crosses made me return to God. I began to deplore the sins  of my youth. Since my marriage I had not committed any voluntarily. Yet  I still had some sentiments "]]]
