It is far, but we shall win through.\"  Caught by the storm between the two pans he had been hours staggering  through the raging chaos, and had reached the pan only after the sun  had risen and the storm had ceased to find it without a vestige of  water.    Casting about in the dunes, he had searched for t'samma without avail,  and filled with anxiety for me had been torn between a desire to return  at once, and the absolute necessity of finding water. Hurrying from one  prominent dune to another he had scanned the desert in all directions,  and had even found one or two more pans, but again waterless. One,  however, showed that it had held water recently for it was still moist,  and there he had found a flock of the tiny Namaqua partridge, so  plentiful in certain parts of the desert. These little birds are swift  of flight, and fly long distances in search of water; and Inyati, as  they rose in a cloud from their old drinking place, had marked the  direction of their flight. North-east they went, and his keen eyes had  followed them till they were no longer visible, and as he watched he  saw many other flocks, and all flying in the same direction. \"There is  the water,\" thought Inyati, and he had toiled on in their wake, but the  way was far, and it was hours before, from a high dune, he had seen a  large pan in the distance, to which all the birds were converging. \"A  big pan, master,\" he said, \"with thick bush and big trees an oasis or  perhaps who knows? a river bed.\" And frantic with thirst as he was, he  had not gone on, but turned back hoping to find me alive.    My heart leapt with joy at the news, for with the knowledge that water  awaited us we could struggle on but the horses? Inyati shook his head  as he examined them. \"That one will die before morning,\" said he, \"but  maybe we can save the others, though they cannot carry us. We must eat,  drink, and sleep, for the way is long and we are weak. And now, master,  if all the tobacco is not there under the big dune with the other  packs, I will smoke, for I have missed my tobacco sadly.\"    How he enjoyed himself, this lighthearted philosopher of the desert!  Long steaks of tender gemsbok he cut and grilled on the wood ashes of  the tiny fire, treating in a like manner the juicy udders after he had  squeezed out most of the milk. The water he would not touch, but his  appetite seemed unappeasable; steak after steak disappeared and still  he carved and cooked, smoking between whiles, and singing some never-  ending song of all the fine wives he would buy, and what he would do to  certain priests, if he got his \"little gun\" safe to his own country.  His cheery presence, and the reliance I placed in him cheered me  enormously, and I realized that I, too, was hungry. And so we ate, and  smoked, and slept, till nearly midnight; and then, keeping the Southern  Cross low down on the horizon on our right, we once more entered the  dunes.    The horse that Inyati had referred to was obviously dying, and a  merciful bullet put an end to the poor brute's sufferings. The others  trudged wearily after us, making but slow progress, but doing better  than I had conceived possible of animals that had not eaten or drank  for thirty-six hours. But morning found them dead beat; they stood  stock still as the sun rose, and neither coaxing nor flogging could get  the poor brutes a step farther. According to Inyati's reckoning we were  still four hours from the water, and it was obvious that once we left  them we could never hope to save them, for we could never bring back  enough water to keep them alive.    \"There is but one thing,\" said Inyati, as he slipped their loads off.  \"Water we cannot bring them, nor would it be in time, for once the sun  is hot they will die. But stay here, and I will search for a certain  thing. Nay, master,\" he continued, for I had made a gesture of dissent;  \"this time I go not far. But here I see rain has fallen of late, and  though there is no t'samma, there may be another thing that will save  the horses.\"    \"Then I will seek it with you, Inyati,\" I said, for I was determined  not to lose sight of him again.    \"Better rest, master,\" he urged, \"there will be no more sandstorms. And  there is still far to go.\"    But go I would, and so we left the poor horses standing in a forlorn  little group, gazing with sad lack-luster eyes at the masters who had  brought them to such a plight. Inyati took with him a canvas bag that  had been used as a saddlecloth, and I wondered what he hoped to find to  fill it, for there was no vestige of vegetation to be seen, except some  tiny seeds just sprouting here and there in the hollows between the  dunes.    I could see no other evidence of the rain that Inyati spoke of, but  soon, in a deeper depression than usual, we found signs that water had  recently accumulated there, though the spot was now as dry as the  surrounding dunes. But here Inyati, who had been keenly examining the  ground, uttered a grunt of satisfaction, and pointed to a spot close to  his feet. There was no trace of a plant, but a slight swelling, as it  were, of the soil, which showed, too, some small cracks as though  something was trying to burst its way to the surface.    \"Cameel-brod,\" said he, and kneeling down he commenced scooping away  the sand with his hands, and from a few inches below the surface he  soon drew a whitish tuber the size of a large turnip. It was full of  thin watery juice, acrid and sharp to the taste, but as I afterwards  found, extremely acceptable to the horses.    Soon we had the bag nearly full, and cutting them up on our waterproof  ground-sheet, we quickly had a quantity of watery pulp, at which the  animals nuzzled greedily, and which revived them to a remarkable extent  almost at once; so much so indeed, that we had very little difficulty  in hurrying them forward again. The last drop of water had long since  gone, and I was now consumed with thirst, and sick with misgiving as to  what might be found at the pan Inyati had seen. Now we could see it,  and, as yesterday, the flocks of partridges were all flying in that  direction. How I envied them their wings, and how I grudged them the  precious water they would be drinking! At length, footsore, weary, with  eyes scorched by the blinding glare of the sun on the bare sand, and  with lips cracked and tongues swollen with thirst, we staggered out of  the dunes into a wide pan covered with bush and sprinkled with big  trees huge cameel-doorn of thick verdant foliage, which gave the whole  expanse a park-like appearance. They were full of gay-plumaged birds,  butterflies were flitting everywhere, here and there were fine  stretches of thick grass, in fact, after all we had suffered in the  furnace of shade-less sand behind us, the place was a veritable  paradise. And at length, where the trees were thickest, we espied tall  green reeds growing thickly, and a few minutes later our fears were at  an end, for here was water in plenty.    It was thick and muddy, and fouled by wild animals, whose spoors showed  thick all around it; but to us it was absolute nectar, and it needed  all Inyati's persuasion to prevent me from drinking to excess and  probably dying on the spot.    We had to control the horses too, and let them drink but little at a  time, or they too would probably have drank till they dropped dead in  their tracks.    In this pleasant oasis we stayed for three days, resting, recuperating,  and living on the fat of the land. Game there was in abundance, so much  so, indeed, that they were a cause of anxiety, for the water in the  vlei was decreasing rapidly from the number of animals that drank there  nightly, and it was obvious that it would not last for very long unless  rain fell. Signs were not wanting that the season had been  exceptionally dry, for the vlei had at one time been of large extent,  and now nothing but the one small pool remained. At it also drank  myriads of partridges, the air being literally thick with the huge  swarms of them that came in the early morning and again at night, so  tame and fearless that they scarcely troubled to get out of our way,  and we kept our pot going by simply knocking them over with a stick.    We soon explored the pan or oasis which was almost circular in shape  and about a mile in diameter, and completely encircled by dunes; most  of them as barren and forbidding as those we had already passed  through, though to the south there was a certain amount of vegetation.  This, however, was useless to us, as our way was east or north-east,  and in this direction all Inyati's reconnoitering failed to discover  anything but bare dunes, as far as the eye could reach.    Pleasant as the shade and greenery of the oasis was, it was evident  that our stay could not be a lengthy one; moreover, lions were  increasingly numerous, and for the first time in our trip began to  cause us serious anxiety. So bold were they that fires had to be lit at  nightfall and kept going all night; and their roars made sleep  impossible.    The nights were now dark and moonless, and on the third of our stay the  lions were exceptionally troublesome. We could see little beyond the  light of the fires, but roars and growls came from all quarters, and  there were evidences that a large herd of some kind of buck was passing  through the oasis, and these the lions were attacking.    Inyati was nervous and uneasy, not, as he explained, on account of the  lions, his \"little gun\" would see to them, but as to what was happening  at the water-hole, from which we had removed our camp some distance on  account of the lions.    \"Gemsbok, master, a big herd of them, that is what it is,\" he said, as  we listened to the terrific roars in the direction of the water. \"They  seek not water, for they seldom drink, but if it comes in their way  they may do so; moreover, they will be likely to trample the pool into  mud"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21900"],[0,"The Principles of Breeding (#7)"],[1,"by a superior ram of  their own breed, and again the lambs were mongrels, but showed less of  the Leicester characteristics than before. Mr. Shaw at last parted  from these fine ewes without obtaining a single pure-bred lamb.[8]    \"It has been noticed that a well bred bitch, if she have been  impregnated by a mongrel dog, will not although lined subsequently by  a pure dog, bear thorough-bred puppies in the next two or three  litters.\"[9]    The like occurrence has been noticed in respect of the sow. \"A sow of  the black and white breed became pregnant by a boar of the wild breed  of a deep chestnut color. The pigs produced were duly mixed, the color  of the boar being in some very predominant. The sow being afterwards  put to a boar of the same breed as herself, some of the produce were  still stained or marked with the chestnut color which prevailed in the  first litter and the same occurred after a third impregnation, the  boar being then of the same kind as herself. What adds to the force of  this case is that in the course of many years' observation the breed  in question was never known to produce progeny having the slightest  tinge of chestnut color.\"[10]    The above are a few of the many instances on record tending to show  the influence of a first impregnation upon subsequent progeny by other  males. Not a few might also be given showing that the same rule holds  in the human species, of which a single one will suffice here:--\"A  young woman residing in Edinburgh, and born of white parents, but  whose mother previous to her marriage bore a mulatto child by a negro  man servant, exhibits distinct traces of the negro. Dr. Simpson, whose  patient at one time, the young woman was, recollects being struck with  the resemblance, and noticed particularly that the hair had the  qualities characteristic of the negro.\"    Dr. Carpenter, in the last edition of his work on physiology, says it  is by no means an infrequent occurrence for a widow who has married  again to bear children resembling her first husband.    Various explanations have been offered to account for the facts  observed, among which the theory of Mr. McGillivray, V.S., which is  endorsed by Dr. Harvey, and considered (as we shall presently see) as  very probable at least by Dr. Carpenter, seems the most satisfactory.  Dr. Harvey says:        \"Instances are sufficiently common among the lower animals where      the offspring exhibit more or less distinctly over and beyond      the characters of the male by which they were begotten, the      peculiarities also of a male by which their mother at some      former period had been impregnated. * * * Great difficulty has      been felt by physiological writers in regard to the proper      explanation of this kind of phenomena. They have been ascribed      by some to a permanent impression made somehow by the semen of      the first male on the genitals and more particularly on the ova      of the female:[11] and by others to an abiding influence exerted      by him on the imagination and operating at the time of her      connection subsequently with other males and perhaps during her      pregnancy; but they seem to be regarded by most physiologists as      inexplicable.        Very recently, in a paper published in the Aberdeen Journal, a      Veterinary Surgeon, Mr. James McGillivray of Huntley, has      offered an explanation which seems to me to be the true one. His      theory is that \"_when a pure animal of any breed has been      pregnant to an animal of a different breed, such pregnant animal      is a cross ever after, the purity of her blood being lost in      consequence of her connection with the foreign animal, herself_      BECOMING A CROSS FOREVER, _incapable of producing a pure calf of      any breed_.\"    Dr. Harvey believes \"that while as all allow, a portion of the  mother's blood is continually passing by absorption and assimilation  into the body of the foetus, in order to its nutrition and  development, a portion of the blood of the foetus is as constantly  passing in like manner into the body of the mother; that as this  commingles there with the general mass of the mother's own blood, it  inoculates her system with the constitutional qualities of the foetus,  and that, as these qualities are in part derived to the foetus from  the male progenitor, the peculiarities of the latter are thereby so  ingrafted on the system of the female as to be communicable by her to  any offspring she may subsequently have by other males.\"    In support of this view, Mr. McGillivray cites a case in which there  was presented unmistakable evidence that the organization of the  placenta admits the return of the venous blood to the mother; and Dr.  Harvey, with much force, suggests that the effect produced is  analogous to the known fact that constitutional syphilis has been  communicated to a female who never had any of the primary symptoms.  Regarding the occurrence of such phenomena, Dr. Harvey under a later  date says: \"since then I have learned that many among the agricultural  body in this district are familiar to a degree that is annoying to  them with the facts then adduced in illustration of it, finding that  after breeding crosses, their cows though served with bulls of their  own breed yield crosses still or rather mongrels; that they were  already impressed with the idea of contamination of blood as the cause  of the phenomenon; that the doctrine so intuitively commended itself  to their minds as soon as stated, that they fancied they were told  nothing but what they knew before, so just is the observation that  truth proposed is much more easily perceived than without such  proposal is it discovered.\"[12]    Dr. Carpenter, speaking of phenomena analogous to what are here  alluded to, says:    \"Some of these cases appear referable to the strong impression left by  the first male parent upon the female; but there are others which seem  to render it more likely that the blood of the female has imbibed from  that of the foetus, through the placental circulation, some of the  attributes which the latter has derived from its male parent, and that  the female may communicate these, with those proper to herself, to the  subsequent offspring of a different male parentage. This idea is borne  out by a great number of important facts. * * As this is a point of  great practical importance it may be hoped that those who have the  opportunity of bringing observation to bear upon it, will not omit to  do so.\"    In the absence of more general and accurate observations directed to  this point, it is impossible to say to what extent the first male  produces impression upon subsequent progeny by other males. There can  be no doubt, however, but that such an impression is made. The  instances where it is of so marked and obvious a character as in some  of those just related may be comparatively few, yet there is abundant  reason to believe, that although in a majority of cases the effect may  be less noticeable, it is not less real, and demands the special  attention of all breeders.    Whether this result is to be ascribed to inoculation of the system of  the female with the characteristics of the male through the foetus, or  to any other mode of operation, it is obviously of great advantage for  every breeder to know it and thereby both avoid error and loss and  secure profit. It is a matter which deserves thorough investigation  and the observations should be minute and have regard not only to  peculiarities of form, but also to qualities and characteristics not  so obvious; for instance there may be greater or less hardiness,  endurance or aptitude to fatten. These may be usually more dependent  on the dam, but the male is never without a degree of influence upon  them, and it is well established that aptitude to fatten is usually  communicated by the Short-horn bull to crosses with cattle of mixed or  mongrel origin which are often very deficient in this desirable  property.    Mr. McGillivray says: \"A knowledge of the fact must be of the greatest  benefit to the breeder in two ways, positively and negatively. I have  known very great disappointment and loss result from allowing an  inferior male to serve a first rate female--the usefulness of such  female being thereby forever destroyed. As for the positive benefits  arising from the inoculation--they are obvious to any unbiased mind.  The black polled and Aberdeenshire cattle common to this country  (Scotland) may be, and often are, improved by the following plan:  Select a good, well formed, and healthy heifer--put her, in proper  season, to a pure Short-horn bull; after the calf to this Durham bull,  breed from the cow with bulls of her own breed; occasionally, and most  likely the first time, a red calf ultimately having horns will appear  even from the polled bull and cow; but in general the calves will be  of the same type with the polled parents but with many points  improved, and an aptitude to fatten, to come earlier to maturity, &c.,  such as no one of the pure polled or Aberdeenshire breed ever  exhibited in this country, or any other country, however well kept,  previous to the introduction of the Short-horn breed. The offspring of  these breeds thus improved, when bred from again, will exhibit many  points and qualities of excellence similar to the best crosses but  retaining much of the hardiness of the original stock, no mean  consideration for this changeable and often severe climate. And,  moreover, such crosses,--for they are crosses--will command high  prices as improved polled or Aberdeenshire cattle. I happen to know of  a case where a farmer, from a distance purchased a two year old  heifer of the stamp referred to, for the purpose of improving his  polled cattle, and for this heifer he paid fifty guineas.\"    The knowledge of this law[13] gives us a clue to the cause of many of  the disappointments of which practical"]]]
