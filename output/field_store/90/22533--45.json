It was a sorrowful thing for him when his savage brethren set forth on  these errands of theft and murder among his kindred by race, and it was  long before he could make the least show of returning their affection.    It was not until they gave him back some books which they had brought  him from other prisoners, but had then taken from him for some caprice,  that he says he felt his heart warm towards them. They pretended that  the books had been lost, but declared that they were glad they had been  found, for they knew that he was grieved at the loss of them. \"Though  they had been exceedingly kind to me,\" he says, \"I still as before  detested them, on account of the barbarity I beheld after Braddock's  defeat. Neither had I ever before pretended kindness, or expressed  myself in a friendly manner; but now I began to excuse the Indians on  account of their want of information.\"    The family which Smith had been taken into did not stay long in the  Muskingum country, but began the wandering life of the hunters and  trappers, working northward mostly, and visiting the shores and waters  of Lake Erie. It was all very pleasant and full of a wild charm while  the fine weather lasted, especially for the men, who had nothing to do  but to bring in the game and fish for the squaws to cook and care for.  The squaws made the sugar in the spring; they felled the trees and  fashioned from the barks the troughs to catch the maple sap, which they  boiled down into sugar; they planted and tended the fields of corn and  beans; they did everything that was like work, indoors and out, and  the men did nothing that was not like play or war. While their plenty  lasted, it was for all; when the dearth came, every one shared it.  But in this free, sylvan life there was the grace of an unstinted  hospitality. The stranger was pressed to make the lodge of his host his  home, and he was given the best of his store. One day when his Indian  brother came in from the hunt, Smith told him that a passing Wyandot had  visited their camp, and he had given him roast venison. \"And I suppose  you gave him also sugar and bear's oil to eat with his venison?\" Smith  confessed that as the sugar and bear's oil were in the canoe, he did not  go for them. His brother told him he had behaved just like a Dutchman,  and he asked, \"Do you not know that when strangers come to our camp we  are to give them the best we have?\" Smith owned that he had been wrong,  and then his brother excused him because he was so young; but he bade  him learn to behave like a warrior, and do great things, and never be  caught in any such mean actions again.    The Indians were as prompt to praise and reward what they thought fine  in him, as to rebuke what they deemed unworthy; and the second winter  that they spent in Northern Ohio, they gave him a gun again for the  courage and endurance he twice showed when he had lost his way from  camp. Once when he was caught in a heavy storm of snow; he passed the  night in the hollow of a tree, which he made snug by blocking it up with  brush and pieces of wood, and by chopping the rotten inside of the trunk  with his hatchet until he had a soft, warm bed. Another time, when he  was looking at his beaver traps he was overtaken by the dark, and kept  himself from freezing by dancing and shouting till daylight. His Indian  friends honored him for his wise behavior, and as they had now beaver  skins enough, they carried them to the French post at Detroit, where  they bought a gun for him. They bought for themselves a keg of brandy,  and they paid Smith the compliment, when he refused to drink, of making  him one of the guards set over the drinkers to keep them from killing  one another. He helped bring them safely through their debauch, but  nothing could prevent their spending all they had got for their beaver  skins in more and more brandy. Then they went back sick and sorry to the  woods again.    The family Smith was taken into was honored for its uncommon virtue and  wisdom. His two brothers, Tontileaugo and Tecaughretanego were men of  great sense, with good heads and good hearts. They treated Smith with  the greatest love and patience, and took him to task with affectionate  mildness when he transgressed the laws of taste or feeling. The Indians  all despised the white settlers, whom they thought stupid and cowardly,  and they expected to drive them beyond the sea. They despised them for  their impiety, and Tecaughretanego once said to Smith, \"As you have  lived with the white people, you have not had the same advantage of  knowing that the Great Being above feeds his people and gives them their  meat in due season, as we Indians have, who are wonderfully supplied,  and that so frequently that it is evidently the hand of the Great  Owaneeyo that doeth this; whereas the white people have commonly large  flocks of tame cattle, that they can kill when they please, and also  their barns and cribs filled with grain, and therefore have not the same  opportunity of seeing and knowing that they are supported by the ruler  of Heaven and Earth.\"    At this time the Indians were suffering from the famine that their waste  and improvidence had brought upon them; and perhaps Smith might have  said something on the white man's side. But he had nothing to say when  rebuked for smiling at Tecaughretanego's sacrifice of the last leaf of  his tobacco to the Great Spirit \"Brother, I have something to say to  you, and I hope you will not be offended when I tell you of your faults.  You know that when you were reading your books, I would not let the boys  or any one disturb you; but now when I was praying I saw you laughing.  I do not think you look upon praying as a foolish thing; I believe you  pray yourself. But perhaps you think my mode or manner of prayer  foolish; if so, you ought in a friendly manner to instruct me, and not  make sport of sacred things.\"    [Illustration: An Indian Prayer 059L]    The prayer which Tecaughretanego thought ought to have escaped Smith's  derision was one which he made after he began to get well from a long  sickness; and it was certainly very quaint; but if the Father of all  listens most kindly to those children of his who come to him simply  and humbly, he could not have been displeased with this old Indian's  petition.    \"Oh, Great Being, I thank thee that I have obtained the use of my legs  again, that I am now able to walk about and kill turkeys without feeling  exquisite pain and misery: I know that thou art a hearer and a helper,  and therefore I will call upon thee. _Oh, ho, ho, ho!_ grant that my  ankles and knees may be right well, and that I may be able not only to  walk, but to run and to jump as I did last fall. _Oh, ho, ho, ho!_  grant that on this voyage we may frequently kill bears, as they may be  crossing the Scioto and Sandusky. _Oh, ho, ho, ho!_ grant that we may  kill plenty of turkeys along the banks, to stew with our bear meat. _Oh,  ho, ho, ho!_ grant that rain may come to raise the Olentangy about two  or three feet, that we may cross in safety down to the Scioto, without  danger of our canoe being wrecked on the rocks. And now, oh, Great  Being, thou knowest how matters stand--thou knowest that I am a great  lover of tobacco, and that though I know not when I may get any more,  I now make a present of the last I have unto thee, as a free burnt  offering. Therefore I request that thou wilt hear and grant these  requests, and I thy servant will return thee thanks, and love thee for  thy gifts.\"    Smith tells us that a few days after Tecaughretanego made his prayer and  offered up his tobacco, rain came and raised the Olentangy high enough  to let them pass safely into the Scioto. He does not say whether he  thought this was the effect of the old Indian's piety, but he always  speaks reverently of Tecaughretanego's religion. He is careful to  impress the reader again and again with the importance of the Indian  family he had been taken into, and with the wisdom as well as the  goodness of Tecaughretanego, who held some such place among the Ottawas,  he says, as Socrates held among the Athenians. He was against the  Indians' taking part in the war between the French and English; he  believed they ought to leave these to fight out their own quarrels;  and in all the affairs of his people, he favored justice, truth, and  honesty. The Indians, indeed, never stole from one another, but they  thought it quite right to rob even their French allies; and it will help  us to a real understanding of their principles, if we remember that the  good and wise Tecaughretanego is never shown as rebuking the cruelty  and treachery of the war parties in their attacks on the English  settlements. The Indian's virtues are always for his own tribe; outside  of it, all the crimes are virtues, and it is right to lie, to cheat,  to steal, to kill; as it was with our own ancestors when they lived as  tribes.    Smith was always treated like one of themselves by his Indian brothers,  and he had a deep affection for them. Once, in a time of famine, when  Tecaughretanego lay helpless in his cabin, suffering patiently with  the rheumatism which crippled him, Smith hunted two whole days without  killing any game, and then came home faint with hunger and fatigue.  Tecaughretanego bade his little son bring him a broth which the boy had  made with some wildcat bones left by the buzzards near the camp, and  when Smith had eaten he rebuked him for his despair, and charged him  never again to doubt that God would care for him, because God always  cared for those children of his who trusted in him, as the Indians did,  while the white men trusted in themselves. The next day Smith went out  again, but the noise made by the snow crust breaking under his feet  frightened the deer he saw, and he could not get a shot at them.

While conversing with the _dooty_ of the  place he heard a horse neigh in one of the huts.  The _dooty_ inquired  with a smile if he knew who was speaking to him.  He explained himself  by telling Park that his horse was still alive and somewhat recovered  from his fatigue, and that he must take the animal with him.    Though tolerably well treated at the villages where he stopped, he in  vain endeavoured to obtain a guide.  The rains were now falling, and the  country, it was supposed, would soon be completely flooded.  He heard  that a report had been abroad that he had come to Bambarra as a spy and  that, as Mansong had not admitted him into his presence, the _dooties_  of the different towns might treat him as they pleased.    A little before sunset of the 11th of August he reached Sansanding.  Here even Mamadi, who had formerly been so kind to him, scarcely gave  him a welcome, and everyone seemed to shun him.  Mamadi, however, came  privately to him in the evening, and told him that Mansong had  despatched a canoe to bring him back, and advised him to set off from  Sansanding before daybreak, cautioning him not to stop at any town near  Sego.  He therefore resumed his journey on the 12th, and in the  afternoon reached the neighbourhood of Kabba.    As he approached, one of several people who were standing at the gate  ran towards him and, taking his horse by the bridle, led him round the  walls of the town and, pointing to the west, told him to go along or it  would be the worse for him.  He in vain represented the danger of being  benighted in the woods, exposed to the inclemency of the weather and the  fury of wild beasts.  \"Go along,\" was the only answer he received.  He  found that these negroes had acted thus from kindness, as the king's  messengers who had come to seize him were inside the town.    Being repulsed from another village, he went on till he reached a small  one somewhat out of the road, and sat down under a tree by a well.  Two  or three women came to draw water and, perceiving the stranger, enquired  where he was going.  On Park telling them to Sego, one of them went in  to acquaint the _dooty_.  In a little time the _dooty_ sent for him, and  permitted him to sleep in a large hut.    Next day he again set forward, meeting with the same inhospitable  treatment as before, and having for three days to subsist on uncooked  corn.  He was repulsed in like manner from the gates of Taffara; and at  the village of Sooha, which he reached next day, he in vain endeavoured  to procure some corn from the _dooty_, who was sitting by the gate.  While Park was speaking to the old man, he called to a slave to bring  his paddle along with him, and when he brought it, told him to dig a  hole in the ground, pointing to a spot at no great distance.  While  the slave was thus engaged, the _dooty_ kept muttering the  words--\"Good-for-nothing!  A real plague!\"  These expressions, coupled  with the appearance of the pit the lad had dug, which looked much like a  grave, made Park think it prudent to decamp.  He had just mounted his  horse, when the slave who had gone into the village returned, dragging  the corpse of a boy by a leg and arm, which he threw into the pit with  savage indifference, and at once began to cover it up with earth.    At sunset Park reached Koohkorro, a considerable town, and the great  market for salt.  Here he was received into the house of a Bambarran  who, once a slave to a Moor, had obtained his freedom and was now a  merchant.  Finding that his guest was a Christian, he immediately  desired him to write a _saphie_, saying that he would dress him a supper  of rice if he would produce one to protect him from wicked men.  Park  therefore covered the board on both sides, when his landlord, wishing to  have the full force of the charm, washed the writing from the board into  a calabash with a little water and, having said a few prayers over it,  drank the whole draught; after which, lest a single word should escape,  he licked the board until it was quite dry.  The _dooty_ of the place  next sent to have a _saphie_ written--a charm to procure wealth.  So  highly satisfied was he with his bargain that he presented the traveller  with some meal and milk, and promised him in the morning some more milk  for his breakfast.    When Park had finished his supper of rice and salt, he lay down upon a  bullock's hide and slept quietly until morning, this being the first  good meal and refreshing sleep he had enjoyed for a long time.    After leaving this place, having been misdirected as to his road, he  reached a deep creek.  Rather than turn back, he went behind his horse  and pushed him headlong into the water; then, taking the bridle in his  teeth, he swam to the other side.  This was the third creek he had  crossed in this manner since he had left Sego.  His clothes were,  indeed, constantly wet from the rain and dew; and the roads being very  deep and full of mud, such a washing was sometimes pleasant.    At Bammakoo, which he reached on the evening of the next day, he was  received into the house of a negro merchant, of whom there are many  wealthy ones in the place, trading chiefly in salt.  He was feasted also  by a number of Moors, who spoke good Mandingo, and were more civil to  him than their countrymen had before been.  One of them had travelled to  Rio Grande, and spoke highly of the Christians.  From this man he  received a present of boiled rice and milk.  He also met a slave  merchant who had resided some years on the Gambia, who informed him  about the places which lay in his intended course to the westward.  He  was told that the road was impassable at this season of the year, and  that there was a rapid river to cross.  Having, however, no money to  maintain himself, Park determined at all risks to push on, and, having  obtained a singing man who said he knew the road over the hills, set off  the next day.  His musical conductor, however, lost the right path and,  when among the hills, leaping to the top of a rock as if to look out for  the road, suddenly disappeared.  Park managed, however, just before  sunset, to reach the romantic village of Koomah, the sole property of a  Mandingo merchant and surrounded by a high wall.  Though seldom visited  by strangers, whenever the weary traveller did come to his residence the  merchant made him welcome.    Park was soon surrounded by the harmless villagers, who had numberless  questions to ask and in return for the information he gave them brought  corn and milk for himself and grass for his horse, and kindled a fire in  the hut where he was to sleep.    Accompanied by two shepherds as guides, he set out the next day from  Koomah.  The shepherds, however, walked on ahead, troubling themselves  but little about him.    The country was very rough, and the declivity so great that a false step  would have caused him and his horse to be dashed to pieces.    As he was riding on, the shepherds being about a quarter of a mile  before him, he heard a loud screaming as from a person in great  distress.  Supposing that a lion had taken off one of the shepherds, he  hurried on to ascertain what had happened.  The noise had ceased, and in  a short time he perceived one of the shepherds lying among the long  grass near the road, and concluded that the man was dead; but when he  came close to him the shepherd whispered to him to stop, telling him  that a party of armed men had seized upon his companion and shot two  arrows at him.  While considering what to do, he saw at a little  distance a man sitting upon the stem of a tree, and also the heads of  six or seven more who were crouching down among the grass, with muskets  in their hands.  It being impossible to escape, he rode forward towards  them, hoping that they were elephant hunters.  By way of opening the  conversation he inquired if they had shot anything; but in answer one of  them ordered him to dismount, and then, as if recollecting himself,  waved with his hand as a sign that Park might proceed.  He had ridden  some way when they shouted to him again to stop, and told him that the  King of the Foulahs had sent them to carry him to Fooladoo.  Without  hesitating, Park turned and followed them.    They had reached a dark part of the wood when one of them observed in  the Mandingo language, \"This place will do,\" and immediately snatched  his hat from his head.  Feeling that resistance was useless, he allowed  them to proceed till they had stripped him quite naked.  While they were  examining their plunder, Park begged them to return his pocket compass;  but, on his pointing to it as it lay on the ground, one of the banditti  cocked his musket, swearing that he would shoot him if he presumed to  take it.  After this some of them went away with his horse, and the  remainder stood considering whether they should leave him quite naked or  allow him something to shelter him from the sun.  Humanity at last  prevailed, and they returned the worst of his two shirts and a pair of  trousers; one of them also threw back his hat, in the crown of which he  kept his memorandums--probably the reason why they did not wish to keep  it.    Here he was in the midst of a vast wilderness in the depth of the rainy  season, naked and alone, and surrounded by savage animals and men still  more savage, five hundred miles from the nearest European settlement.  His spirits began to fail, but he reflected that no human prudence could  possibly have averted his present sufferings, and that, though a  stranger in a strange land, he was still under the protecting eye of  that Providence who has condescended to call Himself the stranger's  friend.  At this moment the extreme beauty of a small moss in  fructification caught his eye.  Though the whole plant was not much  larger than the top of one of his fingers, he could not contemplate the  delicate"]]]
