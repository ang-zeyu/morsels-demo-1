That is, \"long\"  means the way the grain runs. It is always safe to specify in such a  case. It is common when small pieces are ordered to add one-quarter  to the cost for waste.    In large lots lumber is ordered thus: 800' (B. M.) whitewood, dressed  2 sides to 7/8\", 10\" and up. This means that the width of any piece  must not be less than 10\". Prices are usually given per \"M,\" i. e.,  per 1000 ft.: e. g.: basswood may be quoted at $40.00 per M.    When thin boards are desired it is often economical to buy inch stuff  and have it resawn.    Some lumber is also ordered by the \"running\" or lineal foot,  especially moldings, etc., or by the piece, if there is a standard  size as in fence-posts, studs, etc. Laths and shingles are ordered  by the bundle to cover a certain area. 1000 4\" shingles (=4 bundles)  cover 110 sq. ft. with 4\" weather exposure. 100 laths (1 bundle) each  1/4\" x 1-1/2\" x 4'0\" cover about 150 sq. ft.    There are several methods of measuring lumber. The general rule is to  multiply the length in feet by the width and thickness in inches and  divide by 12, thus: 1\" x 6\" x 15' / 12 = 7-1/2 feet. The use of the  Essex board-measure and the Lumberman's board-measure are described in  Chapter 4, pp. 109 and 111.      THE SEASONING AND MEASURING OF WOOD.

The hand tools in common use in woodworking shops may, for  convenience, be divided into the following classes: 1, Cutting;  2, Boring; 3, Chopping; 4, Scraping; 5, Pounding; 6, Holding; 7,  Measuring and Marking; 8, Sharpening; 9, Cleaning.      1. CUTTING TOOLS.    The most primitive as well as the simplest of all tools for the  dividing of wood into parts, is the wedge. The wedge does not even  cut the wood, but only crushes enough of it with its edge to allow its  main body to split the wood apart. As soon as the split has begun,  the edge of the wedge serves no further purpose, but the sides bear  against the split surfaces of the wood. The split runs ahead of the  wedge as it is driven along until the piece is divided.    It was by means of the wedge that primitive people obtained slabs  of wood, and the great change from primitive to civilized methods  in manipulating wood consists in the substitution of cutting for  splitting, of edge tools for the wedge. The wedge follows the grain  of the wood, but the edge tool can follow a line determined by the  worker. The edge is a refinement and improvement upon the wedge and  enables the worker to be somewhat independent of the natural grain of  the wood.    In general, it may be said that the function of all cutting tools  is to separate one portion of material from another along a definite  path. All such tools act, first, by the keen edge dividing the  material into two parts; second, by the wedge or the blade forcing  these two portions apart. If a true continuous cut is to be made, both  of these actions must occur together. The edge must be sharp enough  to enter between the small particles of material, cutting without  bruising them, and the blade of the tool must constantly force apart  the two portions in order that the cutting action of the edge may  continue.    The action of an ax in splitting wood is not a true cut, for only  the second process is taking place, Fig. 59. The split which opens in  front of the cutting edge anticipates its cutting and therefore the  surfaces of the opening are rough and torn.    [Illustration: Fig. 59. Wedge Action.]    [Illustration: Fig. 60. Edge Action.]    When a knife or chisel is pressed into a piece of wood at right angles  to the grain, and at some distance from the end of the wood, as in  Fig. 60, a continuous cutting action is prevented, because soon the  blade cannot force apart the sides of the cut made by the advancing  edge, and the knife is brought to rest. In this case, it is  practically only the first action which has taken place.    Both the actions, the cutting and the splitting, must take place  together to produce a true continuous cut. The edge must always be in  contact with the solid material, and the blade must always be pushing  aside the portions which have been cut. This can happen only when the  material on one side of the blade is thin enough and weak enough to  be readily bent out of the way without opening a split in front of  the cutting edge. This cutting action may take place either along the  grain, Fig. 61, or across it, Fig. 62.    The bending aside of the shaving will require less force the smaller  the taper of the wedge. On the other hand, the wedge must be strong  enough to sustain the bending resistance and also to support the  cutting edge. In other words, the more acute the cutting edge, the  easier the work, and hence the wedge is made as thin as is consistent  with strength. This varies all the way from hollow ground razors to  cold-chisels. For soft wood, the cutting angle (or bevel, or bezel)  of chisels, gouges and plane-irons, is small, even as low as 20 deg.;  for hard wood, it must be greater. For metals, it varies from 54 deg. for  wrought iron to 66 deg. for gun metal.    [Illustration: Fig. 61. Edge and Wedge Action With the Grain.]    [Illustration: Fig. 62. Edge and Wedge Action Across the Grain.]    Ordinarily a cutting tool should be so applied that the face nearest  the material lies as nearly as possible in the direction of the cut  desired, sufficient clearance being necessary to insure contact of the  actual edge.    There are two methods of using edge tools: one, the chisel or straight  cut, by direct pressure; the other, the knife or sliding cut.    The straight cut, Fig. 63, takes place when the tool is moved into the  material at right angles to the cutting edge. Examples are: the action  of metalworking tools and planing machines, rip-sawing, turning,  planing (when the plane is held parallel to the edge of the board  being planed), and chiseling, when the chisel is pushed directly in  line with its length.    [Illustration: Fig. 63. Straight Cut.]    [Illustration: Fig. 64. Sliding Cut.]    The knife or sliding cut, Fig. 64, takes place when the tool is moved  forward obliquely to its cutting edge, either along or across the  grain. It is well illustrated in cutting soft materials, such as  bread, meat, rubber, cork, etc. It is an advantage in delicate  chiseling and gouging. That this sliding action is easier than the  straight pressure can easily be proved with a penknife on thin wood,  or by planing with the plane held at an angle to, rather than in line  with, the direction of the planing motion. The edge of the cutter then  slides into the material. The reason why the sliding cut is easier,  is partly because the angle of the bevel with the wood is reduced  by holding the tool obliquely, and partly because even the sharpest  cutting edge is notched with very fine teeth all along its edge so  that in the sliding cut it acts like a saw. In an auger-bit, both  methods of cutting take place at once. The scoring nib cuts with a  sliding cut, while the cutting lip is thrust directly into the wood.    The chisel and the knife, one with the edge on the end, and the  other with the edge on the side, are the original forms of all modern  cutting tools.    The _chisel_ was at first only a chipped stone, then it came to be a  ground stone, later it was made of bronze, and still later of  iron, and now it is made of steel. In its early form it is known  by paleontologists as a celt, and at first had no handle, but later  developed into the ax and adze for chopping and hewing, and the chisel  for cuts made by driving and paring. It is quite likely that the celt  itself was simply a development of the wedge.    In the modern chisel, all the grinding is done on one side. This  constitutes the essential feature of the chisel, namely, that the back  of the blade is kept perfectly flat and the face is ground to a bevel.  Blades vary in width from 1/16 inch to 2 inches. Next to the blade on  the end of which is the cutting edge, is the shank, Fig. 65. Next, as  in socketed chisels, there is the socket to receive the handle, or,  in tanged chisels, a shoulder and four-sided tang which is driven into  the handle, which is bound at its lower end by a ferrule. The handle  is usually made of apple wood.    [Illustration: Fig. 65. Firmer-Chisel.]    The most familiar form is the _firmer-chisel_, Fig. 65, which is said  to get its name from the fact that it is firmer or stiffer than the  paring-chisel. (See below.) The firmer-chisel is a general utility  tool, being suited for hand pressure or mallet pounding, for paring or  for light mortising.    Different varieties of chisels are named; (1) according to their uses;  as paring-chisels, framing-chisels, mortise-chisels, carving-chisels,  turning-chisels, etc.    [Illustration: Fig. 66. Paring-Chisel.]    [Illustration: Fig. 67. Framing-Chisel.]    [Illustration: Fig. 68. Mortise-Chisel.]    The _paring-chisel_, Fig. 66, has a handle specially shaped to give  control over its movements, and a long thin blade, which in the  best form is beveled on the two edges to facilitate grooving. It is  intended only for steady pressure with the hand and not for use with a  mallet.

What would other languages give for such a pure concept as _I am_?  They may say, _I stand_, or _I live_, or _I grow_, or _I turn_, but it  is given to few languages only to be able to say _I am_. To us nothing  seems more natural than the auxiliary verb _I am_; but, in reality, no  work of art has required greater efforts than this little word _I am_.  And all those efforts lie beneath the level of the common Proto-Aryan  speech. Many different ways were open, were tried, too, in order to  arrive at such a compound as _asmi_, and such a concept as _I am_. But  all were given up, and this one alone remained, and was preserved  forever in all the languages and all the dialects of the Aryan family.  In _as-mi_, _as_ is the root, and in the compound _as-mi_, the  predicative root _as_, to be, is predicated of _mi_, I. But no  language could ever produce at once so empty, or, if you like, so  general a root as _as_, to be. _As_ meant originally _to breathe_, and  from it we have _asu_, breath, spirit, life, also _as_ the mouth,  Latin _os_, _oris_. By constant wear and tear this root _as_, to  breathe, had first to lose all signs of its original material  character, before it could convey that purely abstract meaning of  existence, without any qualification, which has rendered to the higher  operations of thought the same service which the nought, likewise the  invention of Indian genius, has to render in arithmetic. Who will say  how long the friction lasted which changed _as_, to breathe, into  _as_, to be? And even a root _as_, to breathe, was an Aryan root, not  Semitic, not Turanian. It possessed an historical individuality--it  was the work of our forefathers, and represents a thread which unites  us in our thoughts and words with those who first thought for us, with  those who first spoke for us, and whose thoughts and words men are  still thinking and speaking, though divided from them by thousands, it  may be by hundreds of thousands of years.    This is what I call _history_ in the true sense of the word, something  really worth knowing, far more so than the scandals of courts, or the  butcheries of nations, which fill so many pages of our Manuals of  History. And all this work is only beginning, and whoever likes to  labor in these the most ancient of historical archives will find  plenty of discoveries to make--and yet people ask, What is the use of  learning Sanskrit?    We get accustomed to everything, and cease to wonder at what would  have startled our fathers and upset all their stratified notions,  like a sudden earthquake. Every child now learns at school that  English is an Aryan or Indo-European language, that it belongs to the  Teutonic branch, and that this branch, together with the Italic,  Greek, Celtic, Slavonic, Iranic, and Indic branches, all spring from  the same stock, and form together the great Aryan or Indo-European  family of speech.    But this, though it is taught now in our elementary schools, was  really, but fifty years ago, like the opening of a new horizon of the  world of the intellect, and the extension of a feeling of closest  fraternity that made us feel at home where before we had been  strangers, and changed millions of so-called barbarians into our own  kith and kin. To speak the same language constitutes a closer union  than to have drunk the same milk; and Sanskrit, the ancient language  of India, is substantially the same language as Greek, Latin, and  Anglo-Saxon. This is a lesson which we should never have learned but  from a study of Indian language and literature, and if India had  taught us nothing else, it would have taught us more than almost any  other language ever did.    It is quite amusing, though instructive also, to read what was written  by scholars and philosophers when this new light first dawned on the  world. They would not have it, they would not believe that there could  be any community of origin between the people of Athens and Rome, and  the so-called Niggers of India. The classical scholar scouted the  idea, and I myself still remember the time, when I was a student at  Leipzig, and began to study Sanskrit, with what contempt any remarks  on Sanskrit or comparative grammar were treated by my teachers, men  such as Gottfried Hermann, Haupt, Westermann, Stallbaum, and others.  No one ever was for a time so completely laughed down as Professor  Bopp, when he first published his Comparative Grammar of Sanskrit,  Zend, Greek, Latin, and Gothic. All hands were against him; and if in  comparing Greek and Latin with Sanskrit, Gothic, Celtic, Slavonic, or  Persian, he happened to have placed one single accent wrong, the  shouts of those who knew nothing but Greek and Latin, and probably  looked in their Greek dictionaries to be quite sure of their accents,  would never end. Dugald Stewart, rather than admit a relationship  between Hindus and Scots, would rather believe that the whole Sanskrit  language and the whole of Sanskrit literature--mind, a literature  extending over three thousand years and larger than the ancient  literature of either Greece or Rome--was a forgery of those wily  priests, the Brahmans. I remember too how, when I was at school at  Leipzig (and a very good school it was, with such masters as Nobbe,  Forbiger, Funkhaenel, and Palm--an old school too, which could boast  of Leibnitz among its former pupils) I remember, I say, one of our  masters (Dr. Klee) telling us one afternoon, when it was too hot to do  any serious work, that there was a language spoken in India, which was  much the same as Greek and Latin, nay, as German and Russian. At first  we thought it was a joke, but when one saw the parallel columns of  numerals, pronouns, and verbs in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin written on  the blackboard, one felt in the presence of facts, before which one  had to bow. All one's ideas of Adam and Eve, and the Paradise, and the  tower of Babel, and Shem, Ham, and Japhet, with Homer and AEneas and  Virgil too, seemed to be whirling round and round, till at last one  picked up the fragments and tried to build up a new world, and to live  with a new historical consciousness.    Here you will see why I consider a certain knowledge of India an  essential portion of a liberal or an historical education. The concept  of the European man has been changed and widely extended by our  acquaintance with India, and we know now that we are something  different from what we thought we were. Suppose the Americans, owing  to some cataclysmal events, had forgotten their English origin, and  after two or three thousand years found themselves in possession of a  language and of ideas which they could trace back historically to a  certain date, but which, at that date, seemed, as it were, fallen from  the sky, without any explanation of their origin and previous growth,  what would they say if suddenly the existence of an English language  and literature were revealed to them, such as they existed in the  eighteenth century--explaining all that seemed before almost  miraculous, and solving almost every question that could be asked?  Well, this is much the same as what the discovery of Sanskrit has done  for us. It has added a new period to our historical consciousness, and  revived the recollections of our childhood, which seemed to have  vanished forever.    Whatever else we may have been, it is quite clear now that, many  thousands of years ago, we were something that had not yet developed  into an Englishman, or a Saxon, or a Greek, or a Hindu either, yet  contained in itself the germs of all these characters. A strange  being, you may say. Yes, but for all that a very real being, and an  ancestor too of whom we must learn to be proud, far more than of any  such modern ancestors, as Normans, Saxons, Celts, and all the rest.    And this is not all yet that a study of Sanskrit and the other Aryan  languages has done for us. It has not only widened our views of man,  and taught us to embrace millions of strangers and barbarians as  members of one family, but it has imparted to the whole ancient  history of man a reality which it never possessed before.    We speak and write a great deal about antiquities, and if we can lay  hold of a Greek statue or an Egyptian Sphinx or a Babylonian Bull, our  heart rejoices, and we build museums grander than any royal palaces to  receive the treasures of the past. This is quite right. But are you  aware that every one of us possesses what may be called the richest  and most wonderful Museum of Antiquities, older than any statues,  sphinxes, or bulls? And where? Why, in our own language. When I use  such words as _father_ or _mother_, _heart_ or _tear_, _one_, _two_,  _three_, _here_ and _there_, I am handling coins or counters that were  current before there was one single Greek statue, one single  Babylonian Bull, one single Egyptian Sphinx. Yes, each of us carries  about with him the richest and most wonderful Museum of Antiquities;  and if he only knows how to treat those treasures, how to rub and  polish them till they become translucent again, how to arrange them  and read them, they will tell him marvels more marvellous than all  hieroglyphics and cuneiform inscriptions put together. The stories  they have told us are beginning to be old stories now. Many of you  have heard them before. But do not let them cease to be marvels, like  so many things which cease to be marvels because they happen every  day. And do not think that there is nothing left for you to do. There  are more marvels still to be discovered in language than have ever  been revealed to us; nay, there is no word, however common, if only  you know how to take it to pieces, like a cunningly contrived work of  art, fitted together thousands of years ago by the most cunning of  artists, the human mind, that will not make you listen and marvel more  than any chapter of the Arabian Nights.
