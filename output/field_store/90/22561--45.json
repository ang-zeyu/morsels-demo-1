The stranger could run like a deer. His balls were so swift and so  curved that Spread Feather could not see them. He could not catch one.  They seemed to come from the sky.    At last one ball hit Spread Feather on the mouth. He fell to the ground.  His face was red with anger, and his lips were red with blood.    He sprang to his feet and shouted to the stranger, \"Though I do not like  the taste of your ball, yet I can throw you.\"    \"Very well, then,\" said the stranger. \"We will have a game of 'Catch as  catch can.'\" This is the Indian name for a game of wrestling.    Spread Feather set his feet very hard on the ground.    \"My legs are as strong as the legs of a bear,\" he boasted.    They began to wrestle. Soon Spread Feather's arms fell at his sides. He  panted for air. He had no breath and no strength.    The stranger picked Spread Feather up and tossed him over his head like  a ball. The boy fell without a word.    When Spread Feather opened his eyes, a rabbit sprang into the bushes.    All night, Spread Feather lay and thought, and thought. He was too weak  and too sore to go back to his wigwam. Nor was he eager to meet the  other boys.    At sunrise a rabbit hopped near. The rabbit slyly suggested that he  might like to play another game of ball.    The boy sat up and said to the rabbit, \"Spread Feather is no more. He no  longer struts like a turkey. He has nothing to say. He will win a new  name. It will not be Spread Feather.\"          WHY THE CUCKOO IS SO LAZY      The land was lean and hungry. The Old Man of the North Lodge had  breathed upon the valley. His breath had frozen the corn, and there was  no bread for the people.    The Indian hunters took to the chase. They followed every track of deer  or rabbit. If their arrows brought them meat, they threw it over their  shoulders and ran to the village, that the hungry women and children  might eat.    But one Indian remained in his wigwam. He sat by the fire with his wife  and child, and waited for the hunters to bring game.    This man refused to go on the hunt. He was lazy. All day he sat by the  fire and smoked his pipe. Once in a while, he would stir the water in  the kettle which he kept boiling for the meat that he hoped the hunters  might bring. Whenever the child, his little son, begged him for food, he  would say, \"It isn't done yet.\"    At last the little Indian boy grew so sick and faint for want of food  that he cried aloud.    [Illustration]    The lazy Indian father was angry. He seized the pudding stick, and  struck the child to the ground. Instantly a bird flew up and perched on  the pole over the fire, from which the kettle hung.    \"Now it's done!\" said the bird solemnly, for it did not seem to have a  light heart like other birds.    Now, strange as it may seem this father was no longer cruel and lazy.  His lazy spirit seemed to have gone. He wanted to go at once on the  chase, and hunt food for his wife and little boy.    \"To-night you shall have deer meat to eat,\" he said, as he spread a soft  skin by the fire, for the boy to lie on. Then he turned to place the  child on the skin,--but no boy was there. He had no son. Only that  strange bird perched, joyless and alone, over the fire, on the pole from  which the kettle hung.    \"Now it's done!\" the bird cried again, and with that it flew out of the  wigwam.           *       *       *       *       *    That spring the Indians discovered a new bird in the woods. The bird was  too lazy to build a real nest.    This bird did not weave together twigs and moss, leaves and ferns, bits  of hair and thistledown, to make a cozy, warm, safe nest for its eggs  and young, as did the other birds. This bird would lay its eggs  anywhere. Wherever a few sticks lay crosswise in a track, or in a little  hollow of the ground, or where some twigs or dried ferns were caught  loosely in a bush, there this lazy bird would lay its eggs and rear its  young.    It was too lazy to build a real nest, that was safe and warm for its  little ones.    [Illustration]    The Indians called the bird \"the cuckoo.\" But only one Indian knew how  the cuckoo came to be, and why it is too lazy to build a real nest.          HOW THE COON OUTWITTED THE FOX      A wise old raccoon sat up in a tree near the river where the bear lost  his tail. The coon saw the fox play his foxy trick on the bear, and he  did not like it.    \"The fox is getting a big head,\" said the coon. \"This must not be. His  head must be made smaller. Some of the foxiness must be taken out of it.  He is getting too foxy. He thinks he has the cunning of all the animals,  and that no one can outwit him. Some one must play a 'fox' trick on  him.\"    Not many days later, the coon saw the fox coming down the trail. The  coon was eating some juicy yellow apples that he had found on a tree not  far away. As soon as he saw the fox, he ran up a tree, and began to  smack his lips as the fox had done to tempt the bear.    The fox stopped under the tree, just as the bear had stopped.    \"What tastes so good?\" he asked.    For answer the coon threw down an apple to the fox, just as the fox had  thrown the piece of fish down to the bear.    The fox took the apple and ate it.    \"Fine! Fine!\" said the fox, when he had finished the last mouthful.  \"Where did you get it?\"    [Illustration]    The coon then told the fox how to find the apple tree. He must follow  the trail along the river, down to the pine bluff. Then he must climb  the bluff and run toward the setting sun, until he came to an open  field. In the center of that field stood a great apple tree. It was  filled with juicy yellow apples.    [Illustration]    \"But you can climb the tree and pick your own apples. How can I get them  off the tree?\" whined the fox.    \"Oh, that's easy,\" said the coon. \"Just back off two bow shots from the  tree, then lower your head,--so. Run hard and butt the tree with your  head. You have such a big head, it will shake the tree so hard that all  the apples will fall at once. Do as I tell you, and you will have all  the apples you want for a long time.\"    The fox thanked the coon and started at once.    He found the apple tree, just as the coon had said.    [Illustration]    \"What a fine open place to run in,\" thought the fox. \"I will get such a  fine start that when I hit the tree it will shake the world.\"    Already he began, in his mind, to see the apples falling, like pine  needles, and to feel the earth shake under his feet.    The fox did as the coon had told him. One arrow flight he backed off,  then another. Then he closed his eyes, lowered his head, and ran swiftly  over the thick grass. He struck the tree as hard as ever he could, with  his big head.    Not an apple fell, but a dazed, foolish-looking fox fell to the ground.    Next morning as the sun rose, a shame-faced fox was seen running toward  the woods beyond the pine bluff. He carried his head low, and he seemed  to be playing no foxy tricks.          WHY THE GOLDFINCHES LOOK LIKE THE SUN      It was some moons after the coon outwitted the fox, before they again  met. The coon was hurrying by, when the fox saw him.    Now the fox had not forgotten the trick the coon had played on him. His  head was still sore from that great thump against the apple tree. So the  fox started after the coon. He was gaining, and would have caught him,  had they not come to a tall pine tree.    The coon ran to the very tiptop of the pine tree. There he was safe, for  the fox could not climb.    The fox lay down on the soft pine needles and waited for the coon to  come down. The coon stayed up in the pine tree so long that the fox grew  tired and sleepy. He closed his eyes and thought he would take a short  nap.    The coon watched, until he saw that the fox was sound asleep. Then he  took in his mouth some of the pitch from the pine tree. He ran down the  tree and rubbed the pitch over the eyes of the sleeping fox.    The fox awoke. He sprang up and tried to seize the coon, but, alas! he  could not see what he was doing. The lids of his eyes were held fast  with the pine gum. He could not open them.    The coon laughed at the fox's plight, then ran and left him.    The fox lay for some time under the tree. The pine gum, as it dried,  held the lids of his eyes closer and closer shut. He thought he should  never again see the sun.    Some birds were singing near by. He called them, and told them of his  plight. He asked if they would be so kind as to pick open his eyes.    The birds flew off and told the other birds. Soon many of the little  dark songsters flew back to where the fox lay. Then peck, peck, peck,  went the little bills on the eyelids of the fox. Bit by bit they  carefully pecked away the pine gum. If one grew tired, another bird  would take its place.    [Illustration]    At last the fox saw a streak of light. Soon the lid of one eye flew  open, then the other. The sun was shining, and the world looked very  beautiful to the fox, as he opened his eyes.    He was very grateful to the little birds for bringing him light. He told  them to ask what they would, and he would give it to them.    The little birds said, \"We do not like the plain, dark suits which the  Turkey Buzzard brought us. Make us look like the sun we have brought to  you.\"    The fox looked about him. Beautiful yellow flowers were growing near. He  pressed some of the sun color from them, and with the tip of his tail as  a brush, he began to paint the dark little birds like the sun.    The birds fluttered so with joy, he thought he would paint the bodies  first. Before he could brush the wings and tails with the sun paint,  each little bird had darted away, like a streak of sunshine. So happy  and light of heart were the birds, that they could not wait for the fox  to finish the painting.    This is why"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/221"],[0,"The Return of Sherlock Holmes (#7)"],[1,"you have just heard. I at once saw the horrible danger of my position,  and I hurried to put the case into your hands. I have no doubt that I  should have been arrested either at my City office or at my home. A  man followed me from London Bridge Station, and I have no doubt--Great  Heaven, what is that?\"    It was a clang of the bell, followed instantly by heavy steps upon the  stair. A moment later our old friend Lestrade appeared in the doorway.  Over his shoulder I caught a glimpse of one or two uniformed policemen  outside.    \"Mr. John Hector McFarlane?\" said Lestrade.    Our unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face.    \"I arrest you for the wilful murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of Lower  Norwood.\"    McFarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair, and sank into his  chair once more like one who is crushed.    \"One moment, Lestrade,\" said Holmes. \"Half an hour more or less can make  no difference to you, and the gentleman was about to give us an account  of this very interesting affair, which might aid us in clearing it up.\"    \"I think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up,\" said Lestrade,  grimly.    \"None the less, with your permission, I should be much interested to  hear his account.\"    \"Well, Mr. Holmes, it is difficult for me to refuse you anything, for  you have been of use to the force once or twice in the past, and we owe  you a good turn at Scotland Yard,\" said Lestrade. \"At the same time I  must remain with my prisoner, and I am bound to warn him that anything  he may say will appear in evidence against him.\"    \"I wish nothing better,\" said our client. \"All I ask is that you should  hear and recognise the absolute truth.\"    Lestrade looked at his watch. \"I'll give you half an hour,\" said he.    \"I must explain first,\" said McFarlane, \"that I knew nothing of Mr.  Jonas Oldacre. His name was familiar to me, for many years ago my  parents were acquainted with him, but they drifted apart. I was very  much surprised, therefore, when yesterday, about three o'clock in the  afternoon, he walked into my office in the City. But I was still more  astonished when he told me the object of his visit. He had in his hand  several sheets of a note-book, covered with scribbled writing--here they  are--and he laid them on my table.    \"'Here is my will,' said he. 'I want you, Mr. McFarlane, to cast it into  proper legal shape. I will sit here while you do so.'    \"I set myself to copy it, and you can imagine my astonishment when I  found that, with some reservations, he had left all his property to me.  He was a strange little, ferret-like man, with white eyelashes, and  when I looked up at him I found his keen grey eyes fixed upon me with  an amused expression. I could hardly believe my own senses as I read the  terms of the will; but he explained that he was a bachelor with hardly  any living relation, that he had known my parents in his youth, and that  he had always heard of me as a very deserving young man, and was assured  that his money would be in worthy hands. Of course, I could only stammer  out my thanks. The will was duly finished, signed, and witnessed by  my clerk. This is it on the blue paper, and these slips, as I have  explained, are the rough draft. Mr. Jonas Oldacre then informed me  that there were a number of documents--building leases, title-deeds,  mortgages, scrip, and so forth--which it was necessary that I should see  and understand. He said that his mind would not be easy until the whole  thing was settled, and he begged me to come out to his house at  Norwood that night, bringing the will with me, and to arrange matters.  'Remember, my boy, not one word to your parents about the affair until  everything is settled. We will keep it as a little surprise for  them.' He was very insistent upon this point, and made me promise it  faithfully.    \"You can imagine, Mr. Holmes, that I was not in a humour to refuse him  anything that he might ask. He was my benefactor, and all my desire was  to carry out his wishes in every particular. I sent a telegram home,  therefore, to say that I had important business on hand, and that it was  impossible for me to say how late I might be. Mr. Oldacre had told me  that he would like me to have supper with him at nine, as he might not  be home before that hour. I had some difficulty in finding his house,  however, and it was nearly half-past before I reached it. I found him--\"    \"One moment!\" said Holmes. \"Who opened the door?\"    \"A middle-aged woman, who was, I suppose, his housekeeper.\"    \"And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?\"    \"Exactly,\" said McFarlane.    \"Pray proceed.\"    McFarlane wiped his damp brow and then continued his narrative:--    \"I was shown by this woman into a sitting-room, where a frugal supper  was laid out. Afterwards Mr. Jonas Oldacre led me into his bedroom, in  which there stood a heavy safe. This he opened and took out a mass of  documents, which we went over together. It was between eleven and twelve  when we finished. He remarked that we must not disturb the housekeeper.  He showed me out through his own French window, which had been open all  this time.\"    \"Was the blind down?\" asked Holmes.    \"I will not be sure, but I believe that it was only half down. Yes, I  remember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the window. I could  not find my stick, and he said, 'Never mind, my boy; I shall see a good  deal of you now, I hope, and I will keep your stick until you come back  to claim it.' I left him there, the safe open, and the papers made up  in packets upon the table. It was so late that I could not get back to  Blackheath, so I spent the night at the Anerley Arms, and I knew nothing  more until I read of this horrible affair in the morning.\"    \"Anything more that you would like to ask, Mr. Holmes?\" said Lestrade,  whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this remarkable  explanation.    \"Not until I have been to Blackheath.\"    \"You mean to Norwood,\" said Lestrade.    \"Oh, yes; no doubt that is what I must have meant,\" said Holmes, with  his enigmatical smile. Lestrade had learned by more experiences than he  would care to acknowledge that that razor-like brain could cut through  that which was impenetrable to him. I saw him look curiously at my  companion.    \"I think I should like to have a word with you presently, Mr. Sherlock  Holmes,\" said he. \"Now, Mr. McFarlane, two of my constables are at the  door and there is a four-wheeler waiting.\" The wretched young man  arose, and with a last beseeching glance at us walked from the room. The  officers conducted him to the cab, but Lestrade remained.    Holmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of the will,  and was looking at them with the keenest interest upon his face.    \"There are some points about that document, Lestrade, are there not?\"  said he, pushing them over.    The official looked at them with a puzzled expression.    \"I can read the first few lines, and these in the middle of the second  page, and one or two at the end. Those are as clear as print,\" said  he; \"but the writing in between is very bad, and there are three places  where I cannot read it at all.\"    \"What do you make of that?\" said Holmes.    \"Well, what do YOU make of it?\"    \"That it was written in a train; the good writing represents stations,  the bad writing movement, and the very bad writing passing over points.  A scientific expert would pronounce at once that this was drawn up on a  suburban line, since nowhere save in the immediate vicinity of a great  city could there be so quick a succession of points. Granting that his  whole journey was occupied in drawing up the will, then the train was an  express, only stopping once between Norwood and London Bridge.\"    Lestrade began to laugh.    \"You are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories, Mr.  Holmes,\" said he. \"How does this bear on the case?\"    \"Well, it corroborates the young man's story to the extent that the  will was drawn up by Jonas Oldacre in his journey yesterday. It is  curious--is it not?--that a man should draw up so important a document  in so haphazard a fashion. It suggests that he did not think it was  going to be of much practical importance. If a man drew up a will which  he did not intend ever to be effective he might do it so.\"    \"Well, he drew up his own death-warrant at the same time,\" said  Lestrade.    \"Oh, you think so?\"    \"Don't you?\"    \"Well, it is quite possible; but the case is not clear to me yet.\"    \"Not clear? Well, if that isn't clear, what COULD be clear? Here is a  young man who learns suddenly that if a certain older man dies he will  succeed to a fortune. What does he do? He says nothing to anyone, but  he arranges that he shall go out on some pretext to see his client that  night; he waits until the only other person in the house is in bed, and  then in the solitude of a man's room he murders him, burns his body in  the wood-pile, and departs to a neighbouring hotel. The blood-stains in  the room and also on the stick are very slight. It is probable that he  imagined his crime to be a bloodless one, and hoped that if the  body were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his  death--traces which for some reason must have pointed to him. Is all  this not obvious?\"    \"It strikes me, my good Lestrade, as being just a trifle too obvious,\"  said Holmes. \"You do not add imagination to your other great qualities;  but if you could for one moment put yourself in the place of this young  man, would you choose the very night after the will had been made to  commit your crime? Would it not seem dangerous to you to make so very  close a relation between the two incidents? Again, would you choose an  occasion when you are known to be in the house, when a servant has let  you in? And, finally, would you take the great pains to conceal the  body and yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal?"]]]
