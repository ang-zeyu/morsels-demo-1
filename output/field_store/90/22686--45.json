[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24858"],[0,"The Story of Wool (#7)"],[1,"one band of sheep after another would feed in the  same spot. The first flock would nip off the top of the grass; the next  flock had to eat it closer in order to get food enough; and when the  last flocks came they burrowed into the earth with their sharp noses and  dug the grass up by the roots. Whole stretches of land that had once  been green and beautiful were left bare so that nothing would grow on  them for years and years. Cattle do not eat the turf so close as that,  and I do not wonder that the vaqueros complained, do you?\"    \"I should think they would have!\" agreed Donald heartily.    \"Then, too, the sheep have small, sharp hoofs, you know; these hoofs cut  through the soil so that if many sheep travel over a place they grind  the earth to powder. Well, that is just what happened. The sheep left  the hillsides nothing but patches of brown dust. Things went on from bad  to worse until our government stepped in.\"    Donald kept his eyes intently on Sandy's face.    \"What could our government do?\" he asked earnestly.    \"Well, it could do a good many things, and it did. First, it took about  160,000,000 acres of land as National Forests. It was no longer free  pasture. It belonged to the United States.\"    \"I should think the herders would have been pretty cross about that!\"    \"They were. You can see just how they felt. They made their living by  raising stock, and to be deprived of pasturage angered them. At first  the government intended to stop all herds from feeding in these National  Reserves. They thought it was time to protect the forests that we might  not have floods, landslides, and forest fires. They called it conserving  the forests. Afterward, though, they considered that the western people  made their living by raising cattle and sheep, and they worked out a  plan whereby every owner who wanted to graze on the range should pay a  certain sum to the United States Government for a permit, and should be  allotted a particular pasture for his herd. The only restriction was  that if an owner was granted a permit he must promise to obey the rules  of the range. It was a wise and just arrangement. Only a certain number  of sheep are now allowed to graze on a given area; there is therefore  plenty of grass and no need for the flocks to eat the herbage down close  and destroy it. The money for the permits, in the meantime, goes to the  government, and enriches the United States treasury. Much of this money  is spent in paying men to work on the range and better the conditions  there, so really it comes back to the people who pay it.\"    \"I understand,\" Donald replied quickly, when Sandy paused for breath.  \"It is very interesting isn't it, father? But I do not see how they can  prevent herders who have no permits from grazing on the range.\"    \"They ought not to have to prevent them!\" answered Sandy, hotly. \"The  herders ought to be decent enough to obey the law. If you are granted a  favor you ought to be a gentleman in accepting it. Now I'm born of  generations of shepherds--poor country folk they were, too; but my  people ever had a sense of honor--they were gentlemen.\"    Sandy drew himself up and threw back his head as he spoke the words.    \"I cannot imagine a McCulloch being anything but a gentleman, Sandy,\"  said Mr. Clark, who had been listening carefully to Sandy's story of the  range.    Sandy was pleased.    \"It's many would not think so, Mr. Clark,\" he replied, as he stretched  out his rough, brown hands.    \"One can tell nothing from hands,\" laughed Mr. Clark. \"The heart is the  thing that tells the tale. A clean, honest heart makes a gentleman, and  no one is a gentleman without it.\"    \"But you are not telling me how they kept the herders without permits  off the range,\" put in Donald mischievously.    \"I almost forgot. The question always ruffles me. You did a bad thing to  stir me up about it. I'll tell you. The United States had to put  soldiers on the range--think of it--soldiers to protect the government  from its own people! And when the government was working to help those  very people, too. They called these soldiers rangers. It was their duty  to patrol the dividing line of the National Reserves. Every herder who  passed in must show his permit and let the ranger see that he had with  him no more sheep than he ought to have. That was fair, wasn't it?\"    \"Perfectly!\" nodded Donald.    \"Alack! It is a sad thing that there are people in the world who do not  love their country well enough to obey her laws. If they are too stupid  to see the laws are for their good why can't they trust the government?  Here the government was going to give the herders better pastures and  keep their flocks from being molested in them. Wouldn't you think a man  with a grain of sense would see the wisdom of the plan!\" Sandy's temper  began to rise once more. \"But no! The herders just felt the rangers who  had been stationed to carry out the laws were enemies who had taken away  their freedom. So when the rangers did not see them they tried every way  to steal into the reserves without permits. Two men would start with  their flocks; one would take the attention of the ranger by showing his  permit and while the ranger was busy with him the other man would slide  into the reserve far down the line where he was not noticed.\"    \"What a mean trick!\" cried Donald. \"And what if the ranger happened to  see him?\"    \"Oh, he would gallop after him and ride into his flock, scattering it  every which way as he tried to drive the sheep out of the reserve. Often  the herder would lose hundreds of them.\"    \"Served him right!\"    \"That's what I think, too,\" grinned Sandy. \"The like are not all dead  yet either--worse luck! And this brings me back to the matter of my  permit, Mr. Clark. We are two permits short, sir. The new herds that  came from Kansas City are not counted into our old rating. Did you think  of that? Having more sheep this year we must pay in more money. You  didn't happen to remember, did you, to get permits for those extra  flocks?\"    \"No, Sandy, I didn't; but of course Thornton has attended to it. See,  here he comes. We will ask him. Thornton,\" he called, as the big fellow  passed the door, \"what are we going to do about permits for the new  herds? They are not included in the tax we now pay.\"    \"Don't you worry about more permits, Mr. Clark. I can save you a penny  on that,\" declared Thornton with a knowing wink. \"You pay the government  enough as it is. Leave it to me, sir. I'll see that the herds get into  the range all right, and that it costs you no more. When Sandy goes in  he can talk with the ranger. All the rangers know him and they never  will suspect him. In the meantime Owen can take the Kansas City herd and  slip in further down the line. There is no danger of our being caught.  Many a herder has done it and had no trouble.\"    \"There will be no sliding sheep into the reserves without permits while  I own Crescent Ranch, Thornton,\" said Mr. Clark sternly. \"We will pay  what we owe the government or we will keep fewer sheep.\"    \"I was only trying to save you money, sir,\" Thornton hastened to  explain.    \"You took a very poor method to do it,\" was Mr. Clark's cold reply. \"The  money part of wool-growing is not your care. You are here to raise sheep  in conformity to the laws of your country.\"    \"A mighty poor set of laws they are,\" grumbled Thornton sullenly.    \"You may not like them, but they are for your good nevertheless, and  since you are an American it is up to you to obey them. I keep no man in  my employ who is not--before everything else--a good citizen.\"    Thornton flushed, but made no reply.    Then darting an angry glance at Sandy from beneath his shaggy brows, he  left the room.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER VI    DONALD'S FIRST ADVENTURE ON THE RANGE      After Donald went to bed that night Mr. Clark and Sandy had a long talk  and the next morning when Donald came to breakfast the first question  his father asked was:    \"How would you like to start for the range with Sandy, son, when the  permits come?\"    \"Oh, father! Will you really let me? I have wanted so much to go! I am a  good walker, you know, and I am used to camping. Besides, I should like  to be with Sandy,\" he added shyly.    \"I am convinced that you could be with no better young fellow in the  world, Don, than to be with Sandy McCulloch,\" replied Mr. Clark warmly.  \"Yes, I am going to let you go. I want you to help Sandy, however, all  that you can. You must not be an idler and make extra trouble. You must  take hold and do part of the work if you go. Do not think,\" he added  kindly, \"that I consider you a lazy lad, for you are far from it. You  have been a great help on the ranch since you came. I have not been  ignorant of many thoughtful things that you have been doing to help. I  simply wish to remind you that on the range Sandy will have all he can  do. In the midst of your pleasure do not forget your obligation to be  useful. If you keep your eyes open you will see things that you can do,  just as you have seen them here. You will have a thoroughly good time on  the range, and I am glad to have you go. A little later I may want you  to come back to the ranch to help me. You will be willing to do that,  won't you?\"    \"Of course, father, I'll come whenever you send for me!\" was the instant  response. \"But what are you going to do while I am gone? Can't you come  too?\"    \"I'm afraid not. I do not see how I can leave things here just now.  Provisions must be portioned out and sent to the central camps. Then  there are many repairs to be made and I must attend to those. I wish,  also, to look over the books while I am here. You see I have plenty to  do. When I get my work done I may ride up into the hills and join you  and Sandy.\"    \"I wish you would,\" answered Donald. Then he added thoughtfully:  \"Father, if I stayed and helped you, could you get away any sooner?\"    The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24869"],[0,"The Rámáyan of Válmíki, translated into English verse (#7)"],[1,"d,  Persuaded, captured, or beguiled.  And when the boy is hither led  To him thy daughter duly wed.\"      But how to bring that wondrous boy  His troubled thoughts will long employ,  And hopeless to achieve the task  He counsel of his lords will ask,  And bid his priests and servants bring  With honour saintly Rishyasring.  But when they hear the monarch's speech,  All these their master will beseech,  With trembling hearts and looks of woe,  To spare them, for they fear to go.  And many a plan will they declare    And crafty plots will frame,  And promise fair to show him there,    Unforced, with none to blame.  On every word his lords shall say,    The king will meditate,  And on the third returning day    Recall them to debate.  Then this shall be the plan agreed,    That damsels shall be sent  Attired in holy hermits' weed,    And skilled in blandishment,  That they the hermit may beguile  With every art and amorous wile  Whose use they know so well,  And by their witcheries seduce  The unsuspecting young recluse    To leave his father's cell.  Then when the boy with willing feet  Shall wander from his calm retreat    And in that city stand,  The troubles of the king shall end,  And streams of blessed rain descend    Upon the thirsty land.  Thus shall the holy Rishyasring  To Lomapad, the mighty king,    By wedlock be allied;  For Santa, fairest of the fair,  In mind and grace beyond compare,    Shall be his royal bride.  He, at the Offering of the Steed,  The flames with holy oil shall feed,  And for King Dasaratha gain  Sons whom his prayers have begged in vain.\"  \"I have repeated, Sire, thus far,  The words of old Sanatkumar,  In order as he spoke them then  Amid the crowd of holy men.\"    Then Dasaratha cried with joy,  \"Say how they brought the hermit boy.\"          Canto IX. Rishyasring.      The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,  Unfolded at the king's behest  The plan the lords in council laid  To draw the hermit from the shade:  \"The priest, amid the lordly crowd,  To Lomapad thus spoke aloud:  \"Hear, King, the plot our thoughts have framed,  A harmless trick by all unblamed.  Far from the world that hermit's child  Lives lonely in the distant wild:  A stranger to the joys of sense,  His bliss is pain and abstinence;  And all unknown are women yet  To him, a holy anchoret.  The gentle passions we will wake  That with resistless influence shake    The hearts of men; and he  Drawn by enchantment strong and sweet  Shall follow from his lone retreat,    And come and visit thee.  Let ships be formed with utmost care  That artificial trees may bear,    And sweet fruit deftly made;  Let goodly raiment, rich and rare,  And flowers, and many a bird be there    Beneath the leafy shade.  Upon the ships thus decked a band  Of young and lovely girls shall stand,  Rich in each charm that wakes desire,  And eyes that burn with amorous fire;  Well skilled to sing, and play, and dance  And ply their trade with smile and glance  Let these, attired in hermits' dress,  Betake them to the wilderness,  And bring the boy of life austere  A voluntary captive here.\"    He ended; and the king agreed,    By the priest's counsel won.  And all the ministers took heed    To see his bidding done.  In ships with wondrous art prepared  Away the lovely women fared,  And soon beneath the shade they stood  Of the wild, lonely, dreary wood.  And there the leafy cot they found    Where dwelt the devotee,  And looked with eager eyes around    The hermit's son to see.  Still, of Vibhandak sore afraid,  They hid behind the creepers' shade.  But when by careful watch they knew  The elder saint was far from view,  With bolder steps they ventured nigh  To catch the youthful hermit's eye.  Then all the damsels, blithe and gay,  At various games began to play.  They tossed the flying ball about  With dance and song and merry shout,  And moved, their scented tresses bound  With wreaths, in mazy motion round.  Some girls as if by love possessed,  Sank to the earth in feigned unrest,  Up starting quickly to pursue  Their intermitted game anew.  It was a lovely sight to see    Those fair ones, as they played,  While fragrant robes were floating free,  And bracelets clashing in their glee    A pleasant tinkling made.  The anklet's chime, the Koil's(82) cry    With music filled the place  As 'twere some city in the sky  Which heavenly minstrels grace.  With each voluptuous art they strove  To win the tenant of the grove,  And with their graceful forms inspire  His modest soul with soft desire.  With arch of brow, with beck and smile,  With every passion-waking wile  Of glance and lotus hand,  With all enticements that excite  The longing for unknown delight    Which boys in vain withstand.  Forth came the hermit's son to view  The wondrous sight to him so new,    And gazed in rapt surprise,  For from his natal hour till then  On woman or the sons of men    He ne'er had cast his eyes.  He saw them with their waists so slim,  With fairest shape and faultless limb,  In variegated robes arrayed,  And sweetly singing as they played.  Near and more near the hermit drew,    And watched them at their game,  And stronger still the impulse grew    To question whence they came.  They marked the young ascetic gaze  With curious eye and wild amaze,  And sweet the long-eyed damsels sang,  And shrill their merry laughter rang.  Then came they nearer to his side,  And languishing with passion cried:  \"Whose son, O youth, and who art thou,  Come suddenly to join us now?  And why dost thou all lonely dwell  In the wild wood? We pray thee, tell,  We wish to know thee, gentle youth;  Come, tell us, if thou wilt, the truth.\"    He gazed upon that sight he ne'er  Had seen before, of girls so fair,  And out of love a longing rose  His sire and lineage to disclose:  \"My father,\" thus he made reply,  \"Is Kasyap's son, a saint most high,  Vibhandak styled; from him I came,  And Rishyasring he calls my name.  Our hermit cot is near this place:  Come thither, O ye fair of face;  There be it mine, with honour due,  Ye gentle youths, to welcome you.\"    They heard his speech, and gave consent,  And gladly to his cottage went.  Vibhandak's son received them well  Beneath the shelter of his cell  With guest-gift, water for their feet,  And woodland fruit and roots to eat,  They smiled, and spoke sweet words like these,  Delighted with his courtesies:  \"We too have goodly fruit in store,  Grown on the trees that shade our door;  Come, if thou wilt, kind Hermit, haste  The produce of our grove to taste;  And let, O good Ascetic, first  This holy water quench thy thirst.\"  They spoke, and gave him comfits sweet  Prepared ripe fruits to counterfeit;  And many a dainty cate beside  And luscious mead their stores supplied.  The seeming fruits, in taste and look,  The unsuspecting hermit took,  For, strange to him, their form beguiled  The dweller in the lonely wild.  Then round his neck fair arms were flung,  And there the laughing damsels clung,  And pressing nearer and more near  With sweet lips whispered at his ear;  While rounded limb and swelling breast  The youthful hermit softly pressed.  The pleasing charm of that strange bowl,    The touch of a tender limb,  Over his yielding spirit stole    And sweetly vanquished him.  But vows, they said, must now be paid;    They bade the boy farewell,  And, of the aged saint afraid,    Prepared to leave the dell.  With ready guile they told him where    Their hermit dwelling lay:  Then, lest the sire should find them there,    Sped by wild paths away.  They fled and left him there alone    By longing love possessed;  And with a heart no more his own    He roamed about distressed.  The aged saint came home, to find    The hermit boy distraught,  Revolving in his troubled mind    One solitary thought.  \"Why dost thou not, my son,\" he cried,    \"Thy due obeisance pay?  Why do I see thee in the tide    Of whelming thought to-day?  A devotee should never wear    A mien so sad and strange.  Come, quickly, dearest child, declare    The reason of the change.\"  And Rishyasring, when questioned thus,    Made answer in this wise:  \"O sire, there came to visit us    Some men with lovely eyes.  About my neck soft arms they wound    And kept me tightly held  To tender breasts so soft and round,    That strangely heaved and swelled.  They sing more sweetly as they dance    Than e'er I heard till now,  And play with many a sidelong glance    And arching of the brow.\"  \"My son,\" said he, \"thus giants roam    Where holy hermits are,  And wander round their peaceful home    Their rites austere to mar.  I charge thee, thou must never lay    Thy trust in them, dear boy:  They seek thee only to betray,    And woo but to destroy.\"  Thus having warned him of his foes    That night at home he spent.  And when the morrow's sun arose  Forth to the forest went.    But Rishyasring with eager pace  Sped forth and hurried to the place  Where he those visitants had seen  Of daintly waist and charming mien.  When from afar they saw the son  Of Saint Vibhandak toward them run,  To meet the hermit boy they hied,  And hailed him with a smile, and cried:  \"O come, we pray, dear lord, behold  Our lovely home of which we told  Due honour there to thee we'll pay,  And speed thee on thy homeward way.\"  Pleased with the gracious words they said  He followed where the damsels led.  As with his guides his steps he bent,    That Brahman high of worth,  A flood of rain from heaven was sent    That gladdened all the earth.      Vibhandak took his homeward road,  And wearied by the heavy load  Of roots and woodland fruit he bore  Entered at last his cottage door.  Fain for his son he looked around,  But desolate the cell he found.  He stayed not then to bathe his feet,  Though fainting with the toil and heat,  But hurried forth and roamed about  Calling the boy with cry and shout,  He searched the wood, but all in vain;  Nor tidings of his son could gain.
