Everywhere paralysis, distress, and  numbness, or hostility and chaos both striking one with ever increasing  force the higher the forms of organisation are into which one ascends. The  whole no longer lives at all: it is composed, reckoned up, artificial, a  fictitious thing.    In Wagner's case the first thing we notice is an hallucination, not of  tones, but of attitudes. Only after he has the latter does he begin to  seek the semiotics of tone for them. If we wish to admire him, we should  observe him at work here: how he separates and distinguishes, how he  arrives at small unities, and how he galvanises them, accentuates them,  and brings them into pre-eminence. But in this way he exhausts his  strength the rest is worthless. How paltry, awkward, and amateurish is his  manner of \"developing,\" his attempt at combining incompatible parts. His  manner in this respect reminds one of two people who even in other ways  are not unlike him in style--the brothers Goncourt; one almost feels  compassion for so much impotence. That Wagner disguised his inability to  create organic forms, under the cloak of a principle, that he should have  constructed a \"dramatic style\" out of what we should call the total  inability to create any style whatsoever, is quite in keeping with that  daring habit, which stuck to him throughout his life, of setting up a  principle wherever capacity failed him. (In this respect he was very  different from old Kant, who rejoiced in another form of daring, _i.e._:  whenever a principle failed him, he endowed man with a \"capacity\" which  took its place{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}) Once more let it be said that Wagner is really only  worthy of admiration and love by virtue of his inventiveness in small  things, in his elaboration of details,--here one is quite justified in  proclaiming him a master of the first rank, as our greatest musical  _miniaturist_ who compresses an infinity of meaning and sweetness into the  smallest space. His wealth of colour, of chiaroscuro, of the mystery of a  dying light, so pampers our senses that afterwards almost every other  musician strikes us as being too robust. If people would believe me, they  would not form the highest idea of Wagner from that which pleases them in  him to-day. All that was only devised for convincing the masses, and  people like ourselves recoil from it just as one would recoil from too  garish a fresco. What concern have we with the irritating brutality of the  overture to the \"Tannhauser\"? Or with the Walkyrie Circus? Whatever has  become popular in Wagner's art, including that which has become so outside  the theatre, is in bad taste and spoils taste. The \"Tannhauser\" March  seems to me to savour of the Philistine; the overture to the \"Flying  Dutchman\" is much ado about nothing; the prelude to \"Lohengrin\" was the  first, only too insidious, only too successful example of how one can  hypnotise with music (--I dislike all music which aspires to nothing higher  than to convince the nerves). But apart from the Wagner who paints  frescoes and practises magnetism, there is yet another Wagner who hoards  small treasures: our greatest melancholic in music, full of side glances,  loving speeches, and words of comfort, in which no one ever forestalled  him,--the tone-master of melancholy and drowsy happiness.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} A lexicon of  Wagner's most intimate phrases--a host of short fragments of from five to  fifteen bars each, of music which _nobody knows_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Wagner had the virtue  of _decadents_,--pity.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}          8.      --\"Very good! But how can this _decadent_ spoil one's taste if perchance  one is not a musician, if perchance one is not oneself a  _decadent_?\"--Conversely! How can one _help_ it! _Just_ you try it!--You  know not what Wagner is: quite a great actor! Does a more profound, a more  _ponderous_ influence exist on the stage? Just look at these  youthlets,--all benumbed, pale, breathless! They are Wagnerites: they know  nothing about music,--and yet Wagner gets the mastery of them. Wagner's art  presses with the weight of a hundred atmospheres: do but submit, there is  nothing else to do.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Wagner the actor is a tyrant, his pathos flings all  taste, all resistance, to the winds.    --Who else has this persuasive power in his attitudes, who else sees  attitudes so clearly before anything else! This holding-of-its-breath in  Wagnerian pathos, this disinclination to have done with an intense  feeling, this terrifying habit of dwelling on a situation in which every  instant almost chokes one.----    Was Wagner a musician at all? In any case he was something else to _a much  greater degree_--that is to say, an incomparable _histrio_, the greatest  mime, the most astounding theatrical genius that the Germans have ever  had, our _scenic artist par excellence_. He belongs to some other sphere  than the history of music, with whose really great and genuine figure he  must not be confounded. Wagner _and_ Beethoven--this is blasphemy--and above  all it does not do justice even to Wagner.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} As a musician he was no more  than what he was as a man, he _became_ a musician, he _became_ a poet,  because the tyrant in him, his actor's genius, drove him to be both.  Nothing is known concerning Wagner, so long as his dominating instinct has  not been divined.    Wagner was _not_ instinctively a musician. And this he proved by the way  in which he abandoned all laws and rules, or, in more precise terms, all  style in music, in order to make what he wanted with it, _i.e._, a  rhetorical medium for the stage, a medium of expression, a means of  accentuating an attitude, a vehicle of suggestion and of the  psychologically picturesque. In this department Wagner may well stand as  an inventor and an innovator of the first order--_he increased the powers  of speech __ of music to an incalculable degree_--he is the Victor Hugo of  music as language, provided always we allow that under certain  circumstances music may be something which is not music, but  speech--instrument--_ancilla dramaturgica_. Wagner's music, _not_ in the  tender care of theatrical taste, which is very tolerant, is simply bad  music, perhaps the worst that has ever been composed. When a musician can  no longer count up to three, he becomes \"dramatic,\" he becomes  \"Wagnerian\".{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    Wagner almost discovered the magic which can be wrought even now by means  of music which is both incoherent and _elementary_. His consciousness of  this attains to huge proportions, as does also his instinct to dispense  entirely with higher law and _style_. The elementary factors--sound,  movement, colour, in short, the whole sensuousness of music--suffice.  Wagner never calculates as a musician with a musician's conscience, all he  strains after is effect, nothing more than effect. And he knows what he  has to make an effect upon!--In this he is as unhesitating as Schiller was,  as any theatrical man must be; he has also the latter's contempt for the  world which he brings to its knees before him. A man is an actor when he  is ahead of mankind in his possession of this one view, that everything  which has to strike people as true, must not be true. This rule was  formulated by Talma: it contains the whole psychology of the actor, it  also contains--and this we need not doubt--all his morality. Wagner's music  is never true.    --But it is supposed to be so: and thus everything is as it should be. As  long as we are young, and Wagnerites into the bargain, we regard Wagner as  rich, even as the model of a prodigal giver, even as a great landlord in  the realm of sound. We admire him in very much the same way as young  Frenchmen admire Victor Hugo--that is to say, for his \"royal liberality.\"  Later on we admire the one as well as the other for the opposite reason:  as masters and paragons in economy, as _prudent_ amphitryons. Nobody can  equal them in the art of providing a princely board with such a modest  outlay.--The Wagnerite, with his credulous stomach, is even sated with the  fare which his master conjures up before him. But we others who, in books  as in music, desire above all to find _substance_, and who are scarcely  satisfied with the mere representation of a banquet, are much worse off.  In plain English, Wagner does not give us enough to masticate. His  recitative--very little meat, more bones, and plenty of broth--I christened  \"_alla genovese_\": I had no intention of flattering the Genoese with this  remark, but rather the _older recitativo_, the _recitativo secco_. And as  to Wagnerian _leitmotif_, I fear I lack the necessary culinary  understanding for it. If hard pressed, I might say that I regard it  perhaps as an ideal toothpick, as an opportunity of ridding one's self of  what remains of one's meal. Wagner's \"arias\" are still left over. But now  I shall hold my tongue.          9.      Even in his general sketch of the action, Wagner is above all an actor.  The first thing that occurs to him is a scene which is certain to produce  a strong effect, a real _actio_,(10) with a basso-relievo of attitudes; an  _overwhelming_ scene, this he now proceeds to elaborate more deeply, and  out of it he draws his characters. The whole of what remains to be done  follows of itself, fully in keeping with a technical economy which has no  reason to be subtle. It is not Corneille's public that Wagner has to  consider, it is merely the nineteenth century. Concerning the \"actual  requirements of the stage\" Wagner would have about the same opinion as any  other actor of to-day, a series of powerful scenes, each stronger than the  one that preceded it,--and, in between, all kinds of _clever_ nonsense. His  first concern is to guarantee the effect of his work; he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25016"],[0,"The House of Souls (#7)"],[1,"cooking a cottage pie,  the dish of the evening, and deducting what remained in the scuttle  after the pie was done, it appeared that the wretched thing had consumed  nearly twice the proper quantity of fuel.    'You remember what I said the other night about the range?' said Mrs.  Darnell, as she poured out the tea and watered the leaves. She thought  the introduction a good one, for though her husband was a most amiable  man, she guessed that he had been just a little hurt by her decision  against his furnishing scheme.    'The range?' said Darnell. He paused as he helped himself to the  marmalade and considered for a moment. 'No, I don't recollect. What  night was it?'    'Tuesday. Don't you remember? You had \"overtime,\" and didn't get home  till quite late.'    She paused for a moment, blushing slightly; and then began to  recapitulate the misdeeds of the range, and the outrageous outlay of  coal in the preparation of the cottage pie.    'Oh, I recollect now. That was the night I thought I heard the  nightingale (people say there are nightingales in Bedford Park), and the  sky was such a wonderful deep blue.'    He remembered how he had walked from Uxbridge Road Station, where the  green 'bus stopped, and in spite of the fuming kilns under Acton, a  delicate odour of the woods and summer fields was mysteriously in the  air, and he had fancied that he smelt the red wild roses, drooping from  the hedge. As he came to his gate he saw his wife standing in the  doorway, with a light in her hand, and he threw his arms violently about  her as she welcomed him, and whispered something in her ear, kissing her  scented hair. He had felt quite abashed a moment afterwards, and he was  afraid that he had frightened her by his nonsense; she seemed trembling  and confused. And then she had told him how they had weighed the coal.    'Yes, I remember now,' he said. 'It is a great nuisance, isn't it? I  hate to throw away money like that.'    'Well, what do you think? Suppose we bought a really good range with  aunt's money? It would save us a lot, and I expect the things would  taste much nicer.'    Darnell passed the marmalade, and confessed that the idea was brilliant.    'It's much better than mine, Mary,' he said quite frankly. 'I am so glad  you thought of it. But we must talk it over; it doesn't do to buy in a  hurry. There are so many makes.'    Each had seen ranges which looked miraculous inventions; he in the  neighbourhood of the City; she in Oxford Street and Regent Street, on  visits to the dentist. They discussed the matter at tea, and afterwards  they discussed it walking round and round the garden, in the sweet cool  of the evening.    'They say the \"Newcastle\" will burn anything, coke even,' said Mary.    'But the \"Glow\" got the gold medal at the Paris Exhibition,' said  Edward.    'But what about the \"Eutopia\" Kitchener? Have you seen it at work in  Oxford Street?' said Mary. 'They say their plan of ventilating the oven  is quite unique.'    'I was in Fleet Street the other day,' answered Edward, 'and I was  looking at the \"Bliss\" Patent Stoves. They burn less fuel than any in  the market--so the makers declare.'    He put his arm gently round her waist. She did not repel him; she  whispered quite softly--    'I think Mrs. Parker is at her window,' and he drew his arm back slowly.    'But we will talk it over,' he said. 'There is no hurry. I might call at  some of the places near the City, and you might do the same thing in  Oxford Street and Regent Street and Piccadilly, and we could compare  notes.'    Mary was quite pleased with her husband's good temper. It was so nice of  him not to find fault with her plan; 'He's so good to me,' she thought,  and that was what she often said to her brother, who did not care much  for Darnell. They sat down on the seat under the mulberry, close  together, and she let Darnell take her hand, and as she felt his shy,  hesitating fingers touch her in the shadow, she pressed them ever so  softly, and as he fondled her hand, his breath was on her neck, and she  heard his passionate, hesitating voice whisper, 'My dear, my dear,' as  his lips touched her cheek. She trembled a little, and waited. Darnell  kissed her gently on the cheek and drew away his hand, and when he spoke  he was almost breathless.    'We had better go in now,' he said. 'There is a heavy dew, and you might  catch cold.'    A warm, scented gale came to them from beyond the walls. He longed to  ask her to stay out with him all night beneath the tree, that they might  whisper to one another, that the scent of her hair might inebriate him,  that he might feel her dress still brushing against his ankles. But he  could not find the words, and it was absurd, and she was so gentle that  she would do whatever he asked, however foolish it might be, just  because he asked her. He was not worthy to kiss her lips; he bent down  and kissed her silk bodice, and again he felt that she trembled, and he  was ashamed, fearing that he had frightened her.    They went slowly into the house, side by side, and Darnell lit the gas  in the drawing-room, where they always sat on Sunday evenings. Mrs.  Darnell felt a little tired and lay down on the sofa, and Darnell took  the arm-chair opposite. For a while they were silent, and then Darnell  said suddenly--    'What's wrong with the Sayces? You seemed to think there was something a  little strange about them. Their maid looks quite quiet.'    'Oh, I don't know that one ought to pay any attention to servants'  gossip. They're not always very truthful.'    'It was Alice told you, wasn't it?'    'Yes. She was speaking to me the other day, when I was in the kitchen in  the afternoon.'    'But what was it?'    'Oh, I'd rather not tell you, Edward. It's not pleasant. I scolded Alice  for repeating it to me.'    Darnell got up and took a small, frail chair near the sofa.    'Tell me,' he said again, with an odd perversity. He did not really care  to hear about the household next door, but he remembered how his wife's  cheeks flushed in the afternoon, and now he was looking at her eyes.    'Oh, I really couldn't tell you, dear. I should feel ashamed.'    'But you're my wife.'    'Yes, but it doesn't make any difference. A woman doesn't like to talk  about such things.'    Darnell bent his head down. His heart was beating; he put his ear to her  mouth and said, 'Whisper.'    Mary drew his head down still lower with her gentle hand, and her cheeks  burned as she whispered--    'Alice says that--upstairs--they have only--one room furnished. The maid  told her--herself.'    With an unconscious gesture she pressed his head to her breast, and he  in turn was bending her red lips to his own, when a violent jangle  clamoured through the silent house. They sat up, and Mrs. Darnell went  hurriedly to the door.    'That's Alice,' she said. 'She is always in in time. It has only just  struck ten.'    Darnell shivered with annoyance. His lips, he knew, had almost been  opened. Mary's pretty handkerchief, delicately scented from a little  flagon that a school friend had given her, lay on the floor, and he  picked it up, and kissed it, and hid it away.    The question of the range occupied them all through June and far into  July. Mrs. Darnell took every opportunity of going to the West End and  investigating the capacity of the latest makes, gravely viewing the new  improvements and hearing what the shopmen had to say; while Darnell, as  he said, 'kept his eyes open' about the City. They accumulated quite a  literature of the subject, bringing away illustrated pamphlets, and in  the evenings it was an amusement to look at the pictures. They viewed  with reverence and interest the drawings of great ranges for hotels and  public institutions, mighty contrivances furnished with a series of  ovens each for a different use, with wonderful apparatus for grilling,  with batteries of accessories which seemed to invest the cook almost  with the dignity of a chief engineer. But when, in one of the lists,  they encountered the images of little toy 'cottage' ranges, for four  pounds, and even for three pounds ten, they grew scornful, on the  strength of the eight or ten pound article which they meant to  purchase--when the merits of the divers patents had been thoroughly  thrashed out.    The 'Raven' was for a long time Mary's favourite. It promised the utmost  economy with the highest efficiency, and many times they were on the  point of giving the order. But the 'Glow' seemed equally seductive, and  it was only L8. 5s. as compared with L9. 7s. 6d., and though the 'Raven'  was supplied to the Royal Kitchen, the 'Glow' could show more fervent  testimonials from continental potentates.    It seemed a debate without end, and it endured day after day till that  morning, when Darnell woke from the dream of the ancient wood, of the  fountains rising into grey vapour beneath the heat of the sun. As he  dressed, an idea struck him, and he brought it as a shock to the hurried  breakfast, disturbed by the thought of the City 'bus which passed the  corner of the street at 9.15.    'I've got an improvement on your plan, Mary,' he said, with triumph.  'Look at that,' and he flung a little book on the table.    He laughed. 'It beats your notion all to fits. After all, the great  expense is the coal. It's not the stove--at least that's not the real  mischief. It's the coal is so dear. And here you are. Look at those oil  stoves. They don't burn any coal, but the cheapest fuel in the  world--oil; and for two pounds ten you can get a range that will do  everything you want.'    'Give me the book,' said Mary, 'and we will talk it over in the evening,  when you come home. Must you be going?'    Darnell cast an anxious glance at the clock.    'Good-bye,' and they kissed each other seriously and dutifully, and  Mary's eyes made Darnell think of those lonely water-pools, hidden in  the shadow of the ancient woods.    So, day"]]]
