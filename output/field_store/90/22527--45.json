Come, sir, you may talk to me--for  three minutes!\"    The musical voice had lost nothing of its imperiousness, but for  one instant the lips parted, affording a fleeting glimpse of pearl  beyond the coral.    Her sudden change of front was bewildering.  Now, she entered the  lift and I followed her.  As we ascended side by side I found it  impossible to believe that this dainty white figure was that of an  associate of the Hashishin, that of a creature of the terrible  Hassan of Aleppo.  Yet that she was the same girl who, a few days  after my return from the East, had shown herself conversant with  the plans of the murderous fanatics was beyond doubt.  Her accent  on that occasion clearly had been assumed, with what object I could  not imagine.  Then, as we quitted the lift and entered a cosy  lounge, my companion seated herself upon a Chesterfield, signing to  me to sit beside her.    As I did so she lay back smiling, and regarding me from beneath her  black lashes.  Thus, half veiled, her great violet eyes were most  wonderful.    \"Now, sir,\" she said softly, \"explain yourself.\"    \"Then you persist in pretending that we have not met before?\"    \"There is no occasion for pretence,\" she replied lightly; and I  found myself comparing her voice with her figure, her figure with  her face, and vainly endeavouring to compute her age.  Frankly,  she was bewildering--this lovely girl who seemed so wholly a woman  of the world.    \"This fencing is useless.\"    \"It is quite useless!  Come, I know New York, London, and I know  Paris, Vienna, Budapest.  Therefore I know mankind!  You thought I  was pretty, I suppose?  I may be; others have thought so.  And you  thought you would like to make my acquaintance without troubling  about the usual formalities?  You adopted a singularly brutal  method of achieving your object, but I love such insolence in a man.  Therefore I forgave you.  What have you to say to me?\"    I perceive that I had to deal with a bold adventuress, with a  consummate actress, who, finding herself in a dangerous situation,  had adopted this daring line of defence, and now by her personal  charm sought to lure me from my purpose.    But with the scimitar of Hassan of Aleppo stretched over me, with  the dangers of the night before me, I was in no mood for a veiled  duel of words, for an interchange of glances in thrust and parry,  however delightful such warfare might have been with so pretty an  adversary.    For a long time I looked sternly into her eyes; but their violet  mystery defied, whilst her red-lipped smile taunted me.    \"Unfortunately,\" I said, with slow emphasis, \"you are protected by  my promise, made on the occasion of our previous meeting.  But  murder has been done, so that honour scarcely demands that I respect  my promise further--\"    She raised her eyebrows slightly.    \"Surely that depends upon the quality of the honour!\" she said.    \"I believe you to be a member of a murderous organization, and  unless you can convince me that I am wrong, I shall act accordingly.\"    At that she leaned toward me, laying her hand on my arm.    \"Please do not be so cruel,\" she whispered, \"as to drag me into a  matter with which truly I have no concern.  Believe me, you are  utterly mistaken.  Wait one moment, and I will prove it.\"    She rose, and before I could make move to detain her, quitted the  room; but the door scarcely had closed ere I was afoot.  The  corridor beyond was empty.  I ran on.  The lift had just descended.  A dark man whom I recognized stood near the closed gate.    \"Quick!\" I said, \"I am Cavanagh of the Report!  Did you see a lady  enter the lift?\"    \"I did, Mr. Cavanagh,\" answered the hotel detective; for this was he.    In such a giant inn as this I knew full well that one could come and  go almost with impunity, though one had no right to the hospitality  of the establishment; and it was with a premonition respecting what  his answer would be, that I asked the man--    \"Is she staying here?\"    \"She is not.  I have never seen her before!\"    The girl with the violet eyes had escaped, taking all her secrets  with her!          CHAPTER IX    SECOND ATTEMPT ON THE SAFE      \"You see,\" said Bristol, \"the Hashishin must know that the safe  won't remain here unopened much longer.  They will therefore  probably make another attempt to-night.\"    \"It seems likely,\" I replied; and was silent.  Outside the open  windows whispered the shrubbery, as a soft breeze stole through the  bushes.  Beyond, the moon made play in the dim avenue.  From the  old chapel hard by the sweet-toned bell proclaimed midnight.  Our  vigil was begun.  In this room it was that Professor Deeping had  met death at the hands of the murderous Easterns; here it was that  Marden and West had mysteriously been struck down the night before.    To-night was every whit as hot, and Bristol and I had the windows  widely opened.  My companion was seated where the detective, Marden,  had sat, in a chair near the westerly window, and I lay back in  the armchair that had been occupied by West.    I may repeat here that the house of the late Professor Deeping was  more properly a cottage, surrounded by a fairly large piece of  ground, for the most part run wild.  The room used as a study was  on the ground floor, and had windows on the west and on the south.  Those on the west (French windows) opened on a loggia; those on the  south opened right into the dense tangle of a neglected shrubbery.  The place possessed an oppressive atmosphere of loneliness, for  which in some measure its history may have been responsible.    The silence, seemingly intensified by each whisper that sped through  the elms and crept about the shrubbery, grew to such a stillness  that I told myself I had experienced nothing like it since crossing  with a caravan I had slept in the desert.  Yet noisy, whirling  London was within gunshot of us; and this, though hard enough to  believe, was a reflection oddly comforting.  Only one train of  thought was possible, and this I pursued at random.    By what means were Marden and West struck down?  In thus exposing  ourselves, in order that we might trap the author or authors of the  outrage, did we act wisely?    \"Bristol,\" I said suddenly, \"it was someone who came through the  open window.\"    \"No one,\" he replied, \"came through the windows.  West saw  absolutely nothing.  But if any one comes that way to-night, we  have him!\"    \"West may have seen nothing; but how else could any one enter?\"    Bristol offered no reply; and I plunged again into a maze of  speculation.    Powerful mantraps were set in such a way that any one or anything,  ignorant of their positions, coming up to the windows must  unavoidably be snared.  These had been placed in position with  much secrecy after dusk, and the man on duty at the gate stood  with his back to the wall.  No one could approach him except from  the front.  My thoughts took a new turn.    Was the girl with the violet eyes an ally of the Hashishin?  Thus  far, although she so palpably had tricked me, I had found myself  unable to speak of her to Bristol; for the idea had entered my mind  that she might have learned of the plan to murder Deeping without  directly being implicated.  Now came yet another explanation.  The  publicity given to that sensational case might have interested some  third party in the fate of the stolen slipper!  Could it be that  others, in no way connected with the dreadful Hassan of Aleppo,  were in quest of the slipper?    Scotland Yard had taken care to ensure that the general public be  kept in ignorance of the existence of such an organization as the  Hashishin, but I must assume that this hypothetical third party  were well aware that they had Hassan, as well as the authorities,  to count with.  Granting the existence of such a party, my beautiful  acquaintance might be classified as one of its members.  I spoke  again.    \"Bristol,\" I said, \"has it occurred to you that there may be others,  as well as Hassan of Aleppo, seeking to gain possession of the  sacred slipper?\"    \"It has not,\" he replied.  \"In the strictest sense of the expression,  they would be out for trouble!  What gave you the idea?\"    \"I hardly know,\" I returned evasively, for even now I was loath to  betray the mysterious girl with the wonderful eyes.    The chapel bell sounding the half-hour, Bristol rose with a sigh  that might have been one of relief, and went out to take the report  of the man on duty at the gate.  As his footsteps died away along  the elm avenue, it came to me how, in the darkness about, menace  lurked; and I felt myself succumbing to the greatest dread  experienced by man--the dread of the unknown.    All that I knew of the weird group of fanatics--survivals of a dim  and evil past--who must now be watching this cottage as bloodlustful  devotees watch a shrine violated, burst upon my mind.  I peopled the  still blackness with lurking assassins, armed with the murderous  knowledge of by-gone centuries, armed with invisible weapons which  struck down from afar, supernaturally.    I glanced toward the corner of the room where the safe stood,  reliquary of a worthless thing for which much blood had been spilled.    Then sounded footsteps along the avenue, and my fear whispered that  they were not those of Bristol but of one who had murdered him, and  who came guilefully, to murder me!    I snatched the revolver from my pocket and crossed the darkened room.  Just to the right of one of the French windows I stood looking out  across the loggia to the end of the avenue.  The night was a bright  one, and the room was flooded with a reflected mystic light, but  outside the moon paved the avenue with pearl, and through the trees  I saw a figure approaching.    Was it Bristol?  It had his build, it had his gait; but my fears  remained.  Then the figure crossed the patch of shrubbery and stepped  on to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21272"],[0,"The Bibliotaph, and Other People (#7)"],[1,"hearts. It is indeed a noble procession of books which has passed  in and out of those doors. A day will come in which the owner realizes  that he has as good as the market can furnish, and then banishments  will cease. One sighs not for the volumes which deserved exile, but  for those which were sent away because their master ceased to love  them.    There was no friend with whom the Bibliotaph lived on easier terms  than with the Country Squire. They were counterparts. They  supplemented one another. The Bibliotaph, though he was born and bred  on a farm, had fled for his salvation to the city. The Squire, a man  of city birth and city education, had fled for his soul's health to  the country; he had rendered existence almost perfect by setting up an  urban home in rural surroundings. It was well said of that house that  it was finely reticent in its proffers of hospitality, and regally  magnificent in its kindness to those whom it delighted to honor.    It was in the Country Squire's library that the Bibliotaph first met  that actor with whom he became even more intimate than with the Squire  himself. The closeness of their relation suggested the days of the old  Miracle plays when the theatre and the Church were as hand in glove.  The Bibliotaph signified his appreciation of his new friend by giving  him a copy of a sixteenth-century book 'containing a pleasant  invective against Poets, Pipers, Players, Jesters, and such like  Caterpillars of a Commonwealth.' The Player in turn compiled for his  friend of clerical appearance a scrap-book, intended to show how evil  associations corrupt good actors.    This actor professed that which for want of a better term might be  called parlor agnosticism. The Bibliotaph was sturdily inclined  towards orthodoxy, and there was from time to time collision between  the two. It is my impression that the actor sometimes retired with  four of his five wits halting. But he was brilliant even when he  mentally staggered. Neither antagonist convinced the other, and after  a while they grew wearied of traveling over one another's minds.    It fell out on a day that the actor made a fine speech before a large  gathering, and mindful of stage effect he introduced a telling  allusion to an all-wise and omnipotent Providence. For this he was, to  use his own phrase, 'soundly spanked' by all his friends; that is, he  was mocked at, jeered, ridiculed. To what end, they said, was one an  agnostic if he weakly yielded his position to the exigencies of an  after-dinner speech. The Bibliotaph alone took pains to analyze his  late antagonist's position. He wrote to the actor congratulating him  upon his success. 'I wondered a little at this, remembering how  inconsiderable has been your practice; and I infer that it has been  inconsiderable, for I am aware how seldom an actor can be persuaded to  make a speech. I, too, was at first shocked when I heard that you had  made a respectful allusion to Deity; but I presently took comfort,  _remembering that your gods, like your grease-paints, are purely  professional_.'    He was always capital in these teasing moods. To be sure, he buffeted  one about tremendously, but his claws were sheathed, and there was a  contagiousness in his frolicsome humor. Moreover one learned to look  upon one's self in the light of a public benefactor. To submit to be  knocked about by the Bibliotaph was in a modest way to contribute to  the gayety of nations. If one was not absolutely happy one's self,  there was a chastened comfort in beholding the happiness of the  on-lookers.    A small author wrote a small book, so small that it could be read in  less time than it takes to cover an umbrella, that is, 'while you  wait.' The Bibliotaph had Brobdingnagian joy of this book. He sat and  read it to himself in the author's presence, and particularly  diminutive that book appeared as its light cloth cover was outlined  against the Bibliotaph's ample black waistcoat. From time to time he  would vent 'a series of small private laughs,' especially if he was on  the point of announcing some fresh illustration of the fallibility of  inexperienced writers. Finally the uncomfortable author said, 'Don't  sit there and pick out the mistakes.' To which the Bibliotaph  triumphantly replied, 'What other motive is there for reading it at  all?'    He purchased every copy of this book which he could find, and when  asked by the author why he did so, replied, 'In order to withdraw it  from circulation.' A moment afterwards he added reflectively, 'But how  may I hope to withdraw a book from that which it has never had?'    He was apt to be severe in his judgment of books, as when he said of a  very popular but very feeble literary performance that it was an  argument for the existence of God. 'Such intensity of stupidity was  not realized without Infinite assistance.'    He could be equally emphatic in his comments upon men. Among his  acquaintance was a church dignitary who blew alternately hot and cold  upon him. When advised of some new illustration of the divine's  uncertainty of attitude, the Bibliotaph merely said, 'He's more of a  chameleon than he is a clergyman.'    That Bostonian would be deficient in wit who failed to enjoy this  remark. Speaking of the characteristics of American cities, the  Bibliotaph said, 'It never occurs to the Hub that anything of  importance can possibly happen at the periphery.'    He greatly admired the genial and philanthropic editor of a well-known  Philadelphia newspaper. Shortly after Mr. Childs's death some one  wrote to the Bibliotaph that in a quiet Kentucky town he had noticed a  sign over a shop-door which read, 'G. W. Childs, dealer in Tobacco and  Cigars.' There was something graceful in the Bibliotaph's reply. He  expressed surprise at Mr. Childs's new occupation, but declared that  for his own part he was 'glad to know that the location of Heaven had  at last been definitely ascertained.'    The Bibliotaph habitually indulged himself in the practice of  hero-worship. This propensity led him to make those glorified  scrap-books which were so striking a feature in his collection. They  were no commonplace affairs, the ugly result of a union of cheap  leather, newspaper-clippings and paste, but sumptuous books  resplendent in morocco and gilt tooling, the creations of an artist  who was eminent among binders. These scrap-books were chiefly devoted  to living men,--men who were famous, or who were believed to be on the  high road to fame. There was a book for each man. In this way did the  Bibliotaph burn incense before his Dii majores et minores.    These books were enriched with everything that could illustrate the  gifts and virtues of the men in whose honor they were made. They  contained rare manuscripts, rare pictures, autograph comments and  notes, a bewildering variety of records,--memorabilia which were above  price. Poets wrote humorous verse, and artists who justly held their  time as too precious to permit of their working for love decorated the  pages of the Bibliotaph's scrap-books. One does not abuse the word  'unique' when he applies it to these striking volumes.    The Bibliotaph did not always follow contemporary judgment in his  selection of men to be so canonized. He now and then honored a man  whose sense of the relation of achievement to fame would not allow him  to admit to himself that he deserved the distinction, and whose sense  of humor could not but be strongly excited at the thought of  deification by so unusual a process. It might be pleasant to consider  that the Bibliotaph cared so much for one's letters as to wish not to  destroy them, but it was awful to think of those letters as bound and  annotated. This was to get a taste of posthumous fame before  posthumous fame was due. The Bibliotaph added a new terror to life,  for he compelled one to live up to one's scrap-book. He reversed the  old Pagan formula, which was to the effect that 'So-and-So died and  was made a god.' According to the Bibliotaph's prophetic method, a man  was made a god first and allowed to die at his leisure afterward. Not  every one of that little company which his wisdom and love have marked  for great reputation will be able to achieve it. They are unanimously  grateful that he cared enough for them to wish to drag their humble  gifts into the broad light of publicity. But their gratitude is  tempered by the thought that perhaps he was only elaborately humorous  at their expense.    The Bibliotaph's intellectual processes were so vigorous and his  pleasure in mental activity for its own sake was so intense that he  was quite capable of deciding after a topic of discussion had been  introduced which side he would take. And this with a splendid disdain  of the merits of the cause which he espoused. I remember that he once  set out to maintain the thesis that a certain gentleman, as notable  for his virtues as he was conspicuous for lack of beauty, was  essentially a handsome man. The person who initiated the discussion by  observing that 'Mr. Blank was unquestionably a plain man' expected  from the Bibliotaph (if he expected any remark whatever) nothing  beyond a Platonic 'That I do most firmly believe.' He was not a little  astonished when the great book-collector began an elaborate and  exhaustive defense of the gentleman whose claims to beauty had been  questioned. At first it was dialogue, and the opponent had his share  of talk; but when in an unlucky moment he hinted that such energy  could only be the result of consciousness on the Bibliotaph's part  that he was in a measure pleading his own cause, the dialogue changed  to monologue. For the Bibliotaph girded up his loins and proceeded to  smite his opponent hip and thigh. All in good humor, to be sure, and  laughter reigned, but it was tremendous and it was logically  convincing. It was clearly not safe to have a reputation for good  looks while the Bibliotaph was in"]]]
