However, \"needs must\" under certain circumstances, the skipper and  I therefore scrambled out of the boat--taking Cupid with us to search  out the way and carry a small coil of light line in case it should be  wanted--and proceeded cautiously to claw our way like so many parrots,  over and among the gnarled and twisted roots of the mangrove trees, the  Krooboy leading the way, leaping and swinging himself with marvellous  agility from tree to tree, while we followed slowly in his wake, as  often as not being obliged to make a slip-rope of the line to enable us  to cross some exceptionally wide or awkward gap.  In this manner, after  about half an hour's arduous toil, with the perspiration pouring out of  us until our clothes were saturated with it, while we were driven nearly  frantic by the attacks of the mosquitoes and stinging flies that beset  us by thousands, and could by no means be driven away, we contrived at  length to reach soil firm enough to support our weight, and, some five  minutes later, the solid ground itself.    But, even now, our troubles were only half over; for after we had  crossed the peninsula we still found it impossible to discover a spot  from which the interior of the creek could be seen without laying out  upon the roots of the mangrove trees that bordered the inner as well as  the outer shore of the peninsula, the wearisome business of crawling and  climbing had therefore all to be gone over again, with the result that  the sun was close upon setting before we had reached a spot from which a  clear view of the entire creek could be obtained.  And then we had the  unspeakable mortification of discovering that the expedition must result  in failure; for, save a few canoes, the creek was innocent of craft of  every description--_there were no slavers in it_!  Moreover, the so-  called town of King Olomba consisted only of about fifty miserable  native huts in the very last stage of sordidness and dilapidation; and  there was no sign that a slave barracoon had ever existed near the  place.    The captain stared across the water as though he found it quite  impossible to believe his eyes.  Then he drew the sketch map from his  pocket and once more studied it attentively, muttering to himself the  while.  Finally he sat himself down upon a knot of twisted roots, with  his back against the trunk of the tree, and, spreading the sketch wide  open on his knee, beckoned me to place myself beside him.    \"Just come here and look at this map, Mr Fortescue,\" he said, and he  spoke with the air and in the tones of a man who is so utterly dazed  with disappointment that he begins to doubt the evidence of his own  senses.  \"Just give me your opinion, will ye.  I cannot understand this  business at all.  This map, although only a free-hand sketch, seems to  me to be perfectly accurate.  There, you see, is the mouth of the river,  just as we found it; there are the little islets that we passed  immediately after getting inside; there are the dry mud-banks; and  there, you see, the river widens out, in precise accordance with our  experience; here it narrows again at the bend; there is where the boats  are lying concealed; and this,\" laying his finger upon a particular part  of the sketch, \"is the creek that we are now looking at; and there is  the town of Olomba.  It all seems to me to be absolutely correct.  Does  it not appear so to you?\"    \"Certainly, sir,\" I answered.  \"The sketch answers in every particular  to what we have seen since entering the river--answers to it so  perfectly, indeed, that it might have been copied from a carefully  plotted survey.\"    \"Exactly,\" assented the skipper.  \"Yet it is nothing of the kind; for  with my own eyes I saw it drawn from memory by a man whom I happened to  meet in one of the third-rate hotels in Freetown, which are frequented  by the masters and mates of palm-oil traders and the like.  I happened  to hear him mention that he had been in and out of the Fernan Vaz at  least a dozen times, in his search for cargo along the coast, so I  waited until the people with whom he was talking had left him, and then  I entered into conversation with him, finally inducing him to furnish me  with this sketch.\"    \"And was it from him, sir, that you also obtained the information upon  the strength of which you determined upon this expedition?\"  I asked.    \"Oh, no,\" answered the skipper.  \"I had that from quite a different  source, in a very different kind of house.  The people who told me about  King Olomba's raid, and the plans laid by the slavers for carrying off  the prisoners, were slavers themselves; and they told me of the scheme  because they believed me to be the master of a slaver waiting for  information from the Senegal river.  The cream of the joke was that  these fellows should have told me--_me_, the captain of the _Psyche_--  that the scheme had been carefully planned with the express object of  putting the _Psyche_ upon a false scent and so getting her out of the  way while the negroes were being shipped.\"    \"Yet there seems to have been something wrong somewhere, sir,\" I  ventured to suggest.  \"But it is not with your map; that appears to be  marvellously accurate for a mere free-hand sketch; there is no attempt  at deception apparent there.  This creek that we are looking at is  undoubtedly the one shown on your map, and there is King Olomba's town,  precisely in the position indicated on the sketch; the assumption  therefore is that the man who drew the map for you was dealing quite  honestly with you.  The misleading information, consequently must, it  appears to me, have come from the others; as indeed is the case, seeing  that they led you to believe that you would find at least three or four  large ships in the creek, whereas there are none.\"    \"That is perfectly true,\" concurred the skipper.  \"Yet I quite  understood my informants to say that they were the persons who had  formulated the scheme.\"    \"I suppose, sir,\" said I, giving voice to an idea that had been  gradually shaping itself in my brain, \"it is not possible that the  people who were so singularly frank with you happened to recognise you  as Captain Harrison of H.M.S.  _Psyche_, and gave you that bit of  information with the deliberate purpose of misleading you and putting  you upon a false scent, in order that while you are searching for them  here they may have the opportunity to carry out their scheme elsewhere?  Their story may in the main be perfectly true, but if by any chance they  should have happened to recognise you it would not be very difficult for  them to substitute the name of the Fernan Vaz for that of some other  river, and to mention King Olomba instead of some other king.\"    \"N-o-o,\" said the skipper dubiously; \"it would not.  Yet I cannot see  why, if they had recognised me, they should have gone to the trouble of  spinning an elaborate yarn merely to deceive me.  It would have been  just as easy for them to have knifed me, for there were seven of them,  while I was quite alone.  No, I don't quite see--\"    \"Do you not, sir?\"  I interrupted with a smile.    \"I do.  I see quite clearly two very excellent reasons why they did not  resort to the rough and ready method of the knife.  In the first place,  these fellows attach a ridiculously high value to their own skins, and  never seem to imperil them when an alternative will serve their purpose  equally well; and although they were seven to one, if they really  recognised you they would know perfectly well that, while the ultimate  result of a fight would probably be in their favour, you would certainly  not perish alone; and I suppose none of them were particularly anxious  to accompany you into the Great Beyond.  And, apart from that, they  would know quite well that were the captain of a British man-o'-war to  go a-missing there would be such a stir among their rookeries that soon  there would be no rookeries left.  Oh, no, sir! glad as they might be to  put you quietly out of the way if they had the chance, depend upon it  the last thing that they would dream of would be to attempt anything of  the sort in Sierra Leone.\"    \"Well, well, well, perhaps you are right, young gentleman, perhaps you  are right.  You seem to have quite a gift for reasoning things out,\"  replied the skipper, as he pocketed his map and hove himself up into a  standing position.  \"But it is high time that we should get under way,  for the sun is setting, and we shall have all our work cut out to find  our road back to the boat.  Do you think you will be able to find the  gig, Cupid?\"    \"Yes, I fit, sar,\" answered the Krooboy.  \"But we mus' make plenty  haste; for dem darkness he come too much plenty soon, an' if we slip and  fall into dem mud we lib for die one time.\"    \"Ay, ay,\" answered the skipper, with an involuntary shudder at the  hideous fate thus tersely sketched by Cupid; \"I know that, my lad,  without any telling; so heave ahead as smartly as you like.\"    And therewith we started upon our return journey with all speed;  striding, leaping, slipping, and scrambling from root to root, Cupid  leading the way, I following, and the skipper bringing up the rear,  until at length we stood upon solid ground once more.  But by this time  not only had the sun set but the dusk was gathering about us like a  curtain, while star after star came twinkling out from the rapidly  darkening blue overhead, and the foliage of the trees that hemmed us in  on every side was changing, even as we stood and watched while  recovering our breath, from olive to deepest black.  Now, too, we were  beset, even more pertinaciously than before, by the myriads of  mosquitoes, sand flies, gnats, and other winged biting creatures with  which the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21077"],[0,"The Mind and the Brain (#7)"],[1," sciences entirely  and extraordinarily new--auditory, olfactory, and gustatory sciences,  and even others derived from other kinds of sensations which we can  neither foresee nor conceive because they are not, for the moment,  differentiated in us. Outside the matter we know, a very special  matter fashioned of vision and touch, there may exist other matter  with totally different properties.    But let us bring our dream to an end. The interest of our discussion  does not lie in the hypothetical substitution of hearing or any other  sense for sight. It lies in the complete suppression of all  explanation of the noumenal object in terms borrowed from the language  of sensation. And that is our last word. We must, by setting aside the  mechanical theory, free ourselves from a too narrow conception of the  constitution of matter. And this liberation will be to us a great  advantage which we shall soon reap. We shall avoid the error of  believing that mechanics is the only real thing and that all that  cannot be explained by mechanics must be incomprehensible. We shall  then gain more liberty of mind for understanding what the union of the  soul with the body[9] may be.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 8: I would draw attention to a recent volume by GUSTAVE LE  BON, on _Evolution de la Matiere_, a work full of original and bold  ideas.]    [Footnote 9: See [Note 1] on p. 3.--ED.]          CHAPTER IV    ANSWERS TO SOME OBJECTIONS, AND SUMMARY      I have set forth the foregoing ideas by taking the road which to me  seemed the best. On reflection it has occurred to me that my manner of  exposition and demonstration may be criticised much more than my  conclusion. Now, as it is the conclusion alone which here is of  importance, it is expedient not to make it responsible for the  arguments by which I have supported it.    These arguments resolve themselves into the attestation that between  objects and our consciousness there exists an intermediary, our  nervous system. We have even established that the existence of this  intermediary is directly proved by observation, and from this I have  concluded that we do not directly perceive the object itself but a  _tertium quid_, which is our sensations.    Several objections to this might be made. Let us enumerate them.    1. It is not inconceivable that objects may act directly on our  consciousness without taking the intermediary of our nervous system.  Some authors, the spiritualists notably, believe in the possibility  of disembodied souls, and they admit by implication that these souls  remain in communication with the terrestrial world, witness our  actions, and hear our speech. Since they no longer have organs of  sense, we must suppose that these wandering souls, if they exist, can  directly perceive material objects. It is evident that such hypotheses  have, up till now, nothing scientific in them, and that the  demonstrations of them which are given raise a feeling of scepticism  more than anything else. Nevertheless, we have not the right to  exclude, by _a priori_ argument, the possibility of this category of  phenomena.    2. Several German authors have maintained in recent years, that if the  nervous system intervenes in the perception of external objects, it is  a faithful intermediary which should not work any change on those  physical actions which it gathers from outside to transmit to our  consciousness. From this, point of view colour would exist as colour,  outside our eyes, sound would exist as sound, and in a general way  there would not be, in matter, any mysterious property left, since we  should perceive matter as it is. This is a very unexpected  interpretation, by which men of science have come to acknowledge the  correctness of the common belief: they rehabilitate an opinion which  philosophers have till now turned to ridicule, under the name of  naive realism. All which proves that the naivete of some may be the  excessive refinement of others.    To establish scientifically this opinion they batter down the theory  of the specific energy of the nerves. I have recalled in a previous  page[10] of what this theory consists. I have shown that if, by  mechanical or electrical means, our different sensory nerves are  excited, notwithstanding the identity of the excitant, a different  sensation is provoked in each case--light when the optic nerve is  stimulated, sound when the acoustic, and so on. It is now answered to  this argument based on fact that the nature of these excitants must be  complex. It is not impossible, it is thought, that the electric force  contains within itself both luminous and sonorous actions; it is not  impossible that a mechanical excitement should change the electric  state of the nerve affected, and that, consequently, these subsidiary  effects explain how one and the same agent may, according to the  nerves employed, produce different effects.    3. After the spiritualists and the experimentalists, let us take the  metaphysicians. Among them one has always met with the most varying  specimens of opinions and with arguments for and against all possible  theories.    Thus it is, for example, with the external perception. Some have  supposed it indirect, others, on the contrary, that it acts directly  on the object. Those who uphold the direct theory are inspired by  Berkeley, who asserts that the sensitive qualities of the body have no  existence but in our own minds, and consist really in representative  ideas. This doctrine is expressly based on this argument--that thought  differs too much in nature from matter for one to be able to suppose  any link between these two substances. In this particular, some  authors often make an assertion without endeavouring to prove it. They  are satisfied with attesting, or even with supposing, that mind can  have no consciousness of anything but its own states. Other  philosophers, as I have said, maintain that \"things which have a real  existence are the very things we perceive.\" It is Thomas Reid who has  upheld, in some passages of his writings at all events, the theory of  instantaneous perception, or intuition. It has also been defended by  Hamilton in a more explicit manner.[11] It has been taken up again in  recent years, by a profound and subtle philosopher, M. Bergson, who,  unable to admit that the nervous system is a _substratum of knowledge_  and serves us as a percipient, takes it to be solely a motor organ,  and urges that the sensory parts of the system--that is to say, the  centripetal, optic, acoustic, &c, nerves--do not call forth, when  excited, any kind of sensation, their sole purpose being to convey  disturbances from periphery to periphery, or, say, from external  objects to the muscles of the body. This hypothesis, surely a little  difficult to comprehend, places, if I mistake not, the mind, as a  power of perception and representation, within the interval comprised  between the external object and the body, so that the mind is in  direct contact with external objects and knows them as they are.    It will be noticed that these three interpretations, the  spiritualistic, the experimental, and the metaphysical, are in formal  opposition with that which I have set forth earlier in these pages.  They deny the supposition that the nervous system serves us as an  intermediary with nature, and that it transforms nature before  bringing it to our consciousness. And it might seem that by  contradicting my fundamental proposition, those three new hypotheses  must lead to a totally different conclusion.    Now, this is not so at all. The conclusion I have enunciated remains  entirely sound, notwithstanding this change in the starting point, and  for the following reason. It is easy to see that we cannot represent  to ourselves the inner structure of matter by using all our sensations  without distinction, because it is impossible to bring all these  sensations within one single and identical synthetic construction: for  this they are too dissimilar. Thus, we should try in vain to unite in  any kind of scheme a movement of molecules and an odour; these  elements are so heterogeneous that there is no way of joining them  together and combining them.    The physicists have more or less consciously perceived this, and, not  being able to overcome by a frontal attack the difficulty created by  the heterogeneity of our sensations, they have turned its flank. The  ingenious artifice they have devised consists in retaining only some  of these sensations, and in rejecting the remainder; the first being  considered as really representing the essence of matter, and the  latter as the effects of the former on our organs of sense; the first  being reputed to be true, we may say, and the second being reputed  false--that is subjective, that is not representing the _X_ of  matter.[12] I have refuted this argument by showing that all our  sensations without exception are subjective and equally false in  regard to the _X_ of matter, and that no one of them, consequently,  has any claim to explain the others.    Now, by a new interpretation; we are taught that all sensations are  equally true, and that all faithfully represent the great _X._ If they  be all equally true, it is absolutely the same as if they were all  false; no one sensation can have any privilege over the others, none  can be truer than the others, none can be capable of explaining the  others, none can usurp to itself the sole right of representing the  essence of matter; and we thus find ourselves, in this case, as in the  preceding, in presence of the insurmountable difficulty of creating a  synthesis with heterogeneous elements.    All that has been said above is summed up in the following points:--    1. Of the external world, we only know our sensations. All the  physical properties of matter resolve themselves for us into  sensations, present, past, or possible. We may not say that it is by  the intermediary, by the"]]]
