In making up his _Magnalia_, Mather had the use of Hale's manuscript and  transferred from it nearly all that he says, in that work, about Salem  Witchcraft. He copies the passage above quoted. The fact, therefore, is  sufficiently attested by Mather as well as Hale, that, with the  exceptions stated, there was, \"in all things,\" an entire similarity  between the cases of 1688 and 1692.    Nay, further, in this same way we have the evidence of Cotton Mather  himself, that his \"printed account,\" of the case of the Goodwin  children, was actually used, as an authority, by the Court, in the  trials at Salem--so that it is clear that the said \"account,\"  contributed not only, by its circulation among the people, to bring on  the prosecutions of 1692, but to carry them through to their fatal  results--Mr. Hale says: [_p. 27_] \"that the Justices, Judges and others  concerned,\" consulted the precedents of former times, and precepts laid  down by learned writers about Witchcraft. He goes on to enumerate them,  mentioning Keeble, Sir Matthew Hale, Glanvil, Bernard, Baxter and  Burton, concluding the list with \"Cotton Mather's _Memorable  Providences, relating to Witchcraft_, printed, anno 1689.\" Mather  transcribes this also into the _Magnalia_. _The Memorable Providences_  is referred to by Hale, in another place, as containing the case of the  Goodwin children, consisting, in fact mainly of it. [_p. 23_]. Mather,  having Hale's book before him, must, therefore be considered as  endorsing the opinion for which the Reviewer calls me to account,  namely, that \"the Goodwin affair had a very important relation to the  Salem troubles.\" What is sustained touching this point, by both the  Hutchinsons, Hale, and Cotton Mather himself, cannot be disturbed in its  position, as a truth of History.    The reader will, I trust, excuse me for going into such minute processes  of investigation and reasoning, in such comparatively unimportant  points. But, as the long-received opinions, in reference to this chapter  of our history, have been brought into question in the columns of a  journal, justly commanding the public confidence, it is necessary to  re-examine the grounds on which they rest. This I propose to do, without  regard to labor or space. I shall not rely upon general considerations,  but endeavor, in the course of this discussion, to sift every topic on  which the Reviewer has struck at the truth of history, fairly and  thoroughly. On this particular point, of the relation of these two  instances of alleged Witchcraft, in localities so near as Boston and  Salem, and with so short an interval of time, general considerations  would ordinarily be regarded as sufficient. From the nature of things,  the former must have served to bring about the latter. The  intercommunication between the places was, even then, so constant, that  no important event could happen in one without being known in the other.  By the thousand channels of conversation and rumor, and by Mather's  printed account, endorsed by Baxter, and put into circulation throughout  the country, the details of the alleged sufferings and extraordinary  doings of the Goodwin children, must have become well known, in Salem  Village. Such a conclusion would be formed, if no particular evidence in  support of it could be adduced; but when corroborated by the two  Hutchinsons, Mr. Hale, and, in effect, by Mather himself, it cannot be  shaken.    As has been stated, Cotton Mather, previous to his experience with those  \"pests,\" as the Reviewer happily calls \"the Goodwin children,\" probably  believed in the efficacy of prayer, and in that alone, to combat and  beat down evil spirits and their infernal Prince; and John Goodwin's  declaration, that it was not by his advice that he went to the law, is,  therefore, entirely credible in itself. The protracted trial, however,  patiently persevered in for several long months, when he had every  advantage, in his own house, to pray the devil out of the eldest of the  children, resulting in her becoming more and more \"saucy,\" insolent, and  outrageous, may have undermined his faith to an extent of which he might  not have been wholly conscious. He says, in concluding his story in the  _Magnalia_, [_Book VI., p. 75._] that, after all other methods had  failed, \"one particular Minister, taking particular compassion on the  family, set himself to serve them in the methods prescribed by our Lord  Jesus Christ. Accordingly, the Lord being besought thrice, in three days  of prayer, with fasting on this occasion, the family then saw their  deliverance perfected.\"    It is worthy of reflection, whether it was not the fasting, that seems  to have been especially enforced \"on this occasion,\" and for \"three  days,\" that cured the girl. A similar application had before operated as  a temporary remedy. Mather tells us, in his _Memorable Providences_,  [_p. 31_,] referring to a date previous to the \"three days\" fasting,  \"Mr. Morton, of Charlestown, and Mr. Allen, Mr. Moody, Mr. Willard, and  myself, of Boston, with some devout neighbors, kept another day of  prayer at John Goodwin's house; and we had all the children present with  us there. The children were miserably tortured, while we labored in our  prayers; but our good God was nigh unto us, in what we called upon him  for. From this day, the power of the enemy was broken; and the children,  though assaults after this were made upon them, yet were not so cruelly  handled as before.\"    It must have been a hard day for all concerned. Five Ministers and any  number of \"good praying people,\" as Goodwin calls them, together with  his whole family, could not but have crowded his small house. The  children, on such occasions, often proved very troublesome, as stated  above. Goodwin says \"the two biggest, lying on the bed, one of them  would fain have kicked the good men, while they were wrestling with God  for them, had I not held him with all my power and might.\" Fasting was  added to the prayers, that were kept up during the whole time, the  Ministers relieving each other. If the fasting had been continued three  days, it is not unlikely that the cure of the children would, then, have  proved effectual and lasting. The account given in the _Memorables_ and  the _Magnalia_, of the conduct of these children, under the treatment of  Mather and the other Ministers, is, indeed, most ludicrous; and no one  can be expected to look at it in any other light. He was forewarned  that, in printing it, he would expose himself to ridicule. He tells us  that the mischievous, but bright and wonderfully gifted, girl, the  eldest of the children, getting, at one time, possession of his  manuscript, pretended to be, for the moment, incapacitated, by the  Devil, for reading it; and he further informs us, \"She'd hector me at a  strange rate for the work I was at, and threaten me with I know not what  mischief for it. She got a History I was writing of this Witchcraft; and  though she had, before this, read it over and over, yet now she could  not read (I believe) one entire sentence of it; but she made of it the  most ridiculous Travesty in the world, with such a patness and excess of  fancy, to supply the sense that she put upon it, as I was amazed at. And  she particularly told me, That I should quickly come to disgrace by that  History.\"    It is noticeable that the Goodwin children, like their imitators at  Salem Village, the \"afflicted,\" as they were called, were careful,  except in certain cases of emergence, not to have their night's sleep  disturbed, and never lost an appetite for their regular meals. I cannot  but think that if the Village girls had, once in a while, like the  Goodwin children, been compelled to go for a day or two upon very short  allowance, it would have soon brought their \"sport\" to an end.    Nothing is more true than that, in estimating the conduct and character  of men, allowances must be made for the natural, and almost necessary,  influence of the opinions and customs of their times. But this excuse  will not wholly shelter the Mathers. They are answerable, as I have  shown, more than almost any other men have been, for the opinions of  their time. It was, indeed, a superstitious age; but made much more so  by their operations, influence, and writings, beginning with Increase  Mather's movement, at the assembly of the Ministers, in 1681, and ending  with Cotton Mather's dealings with the Goodwin children, and the account  thereof which he printed and circulated, far and wide. For this reason,  then, in the first place, I hold those two men responsible for what is  called \"Salem Witchcraft.\"    I have admitted and shown that Cotton Mather originally relied only upon  prayer in his combat with Satanic powers. But the time was at hand, when  other weapons than the sword of the Spirit were to be drawn in that  warfare.

Up north there were no difficulties with illicit arms; we  allowed a reasonable number per dhow, provided that they were the  private property of the crew, and when rifles were dished out to our  Arab friends the Navy delivered the goods, which were all of Government  mark and pattern.    The political aspect of the blockade required delicate handling anywhere  along the Arabian littoral of the Red Sea, but especially so on the  Hejazi coast. We were at war with the Turks but not with the Arabs, whom  it was our business to approach as friends if they would let us. The  Turks, however, used Arab levies freely against us whose truculence was  much increased on finding they could make hostile demonstrations with  impunity, as the patrol only fired on the Turkish uniform, since few  people can distinguish between a Turco-Arab gendarme and an armed  tribesman at long range unless they know both breeds intimately.    The general standard of honour and good faith at most places along the  Arabian littoral is not high, even from an Oriental point of view, and  is nowhere lower than on the Hejazi coast. Frequently an unattached  tribesman would take a shot at a reconnoitring cutter on general  principles and then rush off to the nearest Turkish post with the  information and a demand for bakshish, and there were several attempts  (one successful) to lure a landing party on to a well-manned but  carefully hidden position. As for the actual levies, they would solemnly  man prepared positions within easy range of even a 3-pounder when we  visited their tinpot ports, relying on us not to fire, and telling their  compatriots what they would do if we did.    Even when examining dhows one had to be on one's guard, and it was best  not to board them to leeward and so run the risk of having their big,  bellying mainsail let go on top of you and getting scuppered while  entangled in its folds. African dhows could generally be trusted not to  resist search, for when a _reis_ has got his owners or agents at a  civilised port like Suakin he likes to keep respectable even if he _is_  smuggling. Our chief difficulty with such craft, before we tightened the  blockade, was due to the nonchalant manner in which they put to sea and  behaved when at sea. Their skippers had the sketchiest idea of what  constituted proper clearance papers and why such papers must agree with  their present voyage. Their confidence too in our integrity, though  touching, was often embarrassing. One of our rules was that considerable  sums in gold must be given up against a signed voucher realisable at  Port Sudan. I was never very brisk at counting large sums of money, and  one day when hove to off Jeddah there were five dhows rubbing their  noses alongside, with about L800 in gold between them and very little  time to deal with them, as we were in shoal water with no way on the  ship. My operations were not facilitated by the biggest Croesus of the  lot producing some L400 in five different currencies from various parts  of his apparel and stating that he had no idea how much there was but  would abide by my decision. I believe he expected me to give him a  receipt in round hundreds and take the \"oddment,\" as we call it in  Warwickshire, for myself. As it was, I was down half a sovereign or so  over the transaction, having given him the benefit of the doubt over  two measly little gold coins of unascertainable value.    Some of them were just as happy-go-lucky in their seamanship, though  skilful enough in handling their outlandish craft. Early one morning,  about fifty miles out of Jeddah, I boarded a becalmed dhow and found  them with the dregs of one empty water-skin between a dozen men. Not  content with putting to sea with a single _mussick_ of water, they had  hove to and slept all night, and so dropped the night breeze, which  would have carried them to Jeddah before it died down. We gave them  water and their position, but I told the _reis_ that he was putting more  strain on the mercy of Allah than he was, individually, entitled to.    But the craft that plied along the Hejazi coast were sinister customers  and wanted watching. Some time before I joined the patrol one of our  ships was lying a long way out off Um-Lejj, as the water is shallow, and  her duty-boat was working close in-shore examining coastal craft. One of  these had some irregularity about her and was sent out to the ship with  a marine and a bluejacket in charge while the cutter continued her task.  That dhow stood out to sea as if making for the ship and then proceeded  along the coast. The cutter, still busied with other dhows, presumed  that the first craft had reported alongside the ship and been allowed to  proceed; the ship naturally regarded her as a craft that had been  examined and permitted to continue her journey. And that is all we ever  knew for certain of her or the fate of our two men. Their previous  record puts desertion out of the question; besides, no sane men would  desert to a barren, inhospitable coast among semi-hostile fanatics whose  language was unknown to them. On the other hand, the men were, of  course, fully armed, and there were but five of the dhow's crew all  told, of whom two were not able-bodied. There must have been the  blackest treachery--probably the unfortunate men goodnaturedly helped  with the running gear and were knocked on the head while so engaged.  Their bodies would, no doubt, have been put over the side when the dhow  was out of sight, and their rifles sold inland at a fancy price.    When I first joined the patrol we were not allowed to bombard or land at  any point between the mouth of the Gulf of Akaba and the Hejaz southern  border. The Turkish fort up at Akaba had been knocked about a good deal  by various ships of the patrol, and the whole place was uninhabited; but  we visited it frequently, as drifting mines were put in up there,  having been taken off the rail at Maan and brought down to the head of  the gulf, in section, by camel. I always suspected the existence of a  Turkish observation-post, but no signs of occupation had been seen for a  long time till H.M.S. \"Fox\" went up one dark night without a light  showing. All dead-lights were shipped, and dark blue electric bulbs  replaced the usual ones where a light of some sort was essential and  visible from out-board. The padre, who had opened the \"vicarage\"  dead-light about an inch to get a breath of air, was promptly spotted by  an indignant Number One who said that it made the ship look like a  floating gin palace. This must have been a pardonable hyperbole, for the  signal-fires ashore which used to herald our approach from afar were not  lit.    We were off Akaba at peep of day, and two armed cutters raced each other  to the beach. I went with the one that made for the stone jetty in the  middle front of the town; we had to jump out into four feet of water, as  the port has deteriorated a good deal since Solomon used it and called  it Eziongeber. A careful search revealed no one in the town, but water  had been drawn recently from the well inside the fort, and a mud hut out  in the desert behind the town seemed a likely covert to draw.    The cutter's officer accompanied me, leaving the crew ensconced in the  cemetery, which was a wise move, for, when we were close to the hut,  heavy fire was opened on us from a hidden trench some three hundred  yards away. We both dropped and rolled into a shallow depression caused  by rain-wash, where we lay as flat as we could while the flat-nosed soft  lead bullets kicked sand and shingle down the backs of our necks. As we  had only revolvers--expecting resistance, if any, to be made among the  houses--we could not reply, but the ship handed out a few rounds of  percussion shrapnel which shook the Turks up enough for us to withdraw.  Fortunately for us, they were using black powder, and outside four  hundred yards one has time to avoid the bullet by dropping instantly at  the smoke. Otherwise they should have bagged us in spite of the support  of our covering party in the cemetery, for the ground was quite open and  so dusty that they could see the break of their heavy picket-bullets to  a nicety.    We landed in force an hour later and turned them out of it. On  returning, the men who searched the hut (which the ship's guns had  knocked endways) brought me a budget of correspondence. It was chiefly  addressed to the officer in charge and told me that the detachment was  Syrian, which I had already suspected from their using the early pattern  Mauser. It gave other useful information, and the men did well to bring  it along; but I would have given much to have found some channel through  which I could return it. Most of it was private; there were several  congratulatory cards crudely illuminated in colours by hand for the  feast of Muled-en-Nebi (the birthday of the Prophet), which corresponds  with our Christmas. There was also a letter from the officer's wife  enclosing a half-sheet of paper on which a baby hand had imprinted a  smeared outline in ink. It bore the inscription \"From your son  Ahmed--his hand and greeting.\"    Early in the spring of 1916 we managed to persuade the political folk at  Cairo to extend our sphere of action. I had particularly marked down  Um-Lejj as containing a well-manned Turkish fort which could be knocked  about without damaging other buildings in the town if we were careful.  It was also a rallying-point for Turkish influence, and it was not  conducive to our prestige or politically desirable that it should  flourish unmolested.    I was in the \"Fox\" again for that occasion, she being the senior ship of  the patrol and the only one that could land an adequate force if  required.    The evening before we anchored far out on the fishing-grounds of Hasani  Island, and I managed to pick up a fisherman who knew where the Turkish  hidden"]]]
