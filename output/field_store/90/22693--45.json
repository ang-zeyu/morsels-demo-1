[Illustration: No. 14.--TENT STITCH.]           *       *       *       *       *    _Simple Cross Stitch._--The worsted or silk is brought up again to the  surface, one thread to the left of the spot where the needle was  inserted, and is crossed over the first or \"tent\" stitch, forming a  regular and even cross on the surface.    [Illustration: No. 15.--SIMPLE CROSS STITCH.]           *       *       *       *       *    _Persian Cross Stitch._--The peculiarity of this stitch is that in the  first instance the silk or worsted is carried across two threads of  the canvas ground, and is brought up in the intermediate space. It is  then crossed over the latter half of the original stitch, and a fresh  start is made.    [Illustration: No. 16.--PERSIAN CROSS STITCH.]    Much of the beauty of Persian embroidery is produced by the  irregularity of the crossing; the stitches being taken in masses, in  any direction that seems most suitable to the design in hand, instead  of being placed in regular rows, with the stitches all sloping in one  direction, as is the case with the modern \"Berlin work,\" this, with  the happy choice of colours for which the Persians are so justly  famous, produces a singular richness of effect.    Allied to these canvas stitches and having their origin in them, are  the numerous forms of groundings, which are now worked on coarse  linens, or in fact on any fabric; and have sometimes, although  incorrectly, been called darning stitches, probably from their  resemblance to the patterns which are found on samplers, for darning  stockings, old table linen, &c. &c. Almost any pattern can be produced  in this style of embroidery, simply by varying the relative length of  the stitches.    Following the nomenclature of the committee which named and catalogued  the specimens of ancient needlework exhibited in the South Kensington  Museum in 1872, we have classed all the varieties of these grounding  stitches under the name of Cushion stitch.           *       *       *       *       *    _Cushion Stitches_ are taken as in laid embroidery, so as to leave all  the silk and crewel on the surface, and only a single thread of the  ground is taken up; but in place of lying in long lines, from end to  end of the material, they are of even length, and are taken in a  pattern, such as a waved line or zigzag; so that when finished the  ground presents the appearance of a woven fabric.    [Illustration: No. 17.--CUSHION STITCH.]    We give an illustration of one variety of cushion stitch, which may  either be worked as described here, or in the hand, as in the woodcut.    A good modern example of this background was exhibited in the School,  on a bed-hanging, worked for the Honourable Mrs. Percy Wyndham, from a  design by Mr. W. Morris. In the Exhibition of Ancient Needlework last  year were many beautiful specimens: notably one enormous wall-hanging  of Italian seventeenth-century work, lent by Earl Spencer. Many of the  fabrics known as \"Tapestries\" are woven imitations of these grounds,  and carry embroidery so perfectly, that on the whole, except for small  pieces, it seems a waste of hand-labour to work them in, as the effect  is not very far removed from that of woven material, while the expense  is, of course, very much greater.    The ancient specimens of this stitch are worked on a coarse canvas,  differing greatly from that which was recently used for Berlin wool  work.    It cannot now be obtained except by having it especially made to  order. It has been replaced by a coarse hand-woven linen for the use  of the School, but the ancient canvas is vastly superior, as its  looseness makes it easier for the worker to keep her stitches in  regular lines.    In some ancient specimens the design is worked in feather stitch, and  the whole ground in cushion stitch. In others the design is in fine  cross or tent stitch. There are several very beautiful examples of  this kind of embroidery in the South Kensington Museum--Italian, of  the seventeenth century.    A variety of cushion stitch, which we frequently see in old Italian  embroideries, was taught in the Royal School of Art-Needlework by Miss  Burden, and used under her direction in working flesh in some large  figures designed by Mr. Walter Crane for wall decoration, and  exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. The stitches  are kept of one uniform length across the design. The next row is  started from half the depth of the preceding stitch and kept of the  same length throughout. Its beauty consists in its perfect regularity.  If worked in the hand, the needle is brought back underneath the  material as in satin stitch; but in the frame all the silk or worsted  can be worked on the surface, with the exception of the small  fastening stitches.    The effect when finished is that of a woven fabric.    It is really more suitable in its original character of a ground  stitch than for working flesh. We have given an illustration of it,  because we are so frequently asked to describe \"Burden stitch.\"    [Illustration: No. 18.--\"BURDEN\" STITCH.]    This form of cushion stitch worked extremely fine has been used for  flesh in very ancient embroideries, even before the introduction of  the _Opus Anglicanum_, and is found in the works of the Flemish,  German, Italian, and French schools of the fourteenth and fifteenth  centuries.    It seems to have been worked in a frame on fine canvas, or on a fabric  of very even threads, and the stitches so taken that the same amount  of silk appears on the back as on the surface of the embroidery.    In a toilet cover of ancient Spanish work recently added to the South  Kensington Museum, the design is entirely embroidered in varieties of  _cushion stitch_ in black floss silk upon a white linen ground. It is,  however, extremely rare to see this stitch used in any other way than  as a ground, except in actual canvas work; in which we often see  varieties of it used to fill in portions of the design, while another  stitch will be devoted entirely to the grounding.    These stitches were often executed on an open net.           *       *       *       *       *    _Stem Stitch_ is used in frame embroidery, and does not differ in any  way from that described at page 20, under \"handwork,\" except that the  needle is of course worked through the material with both hands, as is  the case in all frame work.    The same may be said of \"split stitch;\" but this is more frequently  (because more easily) worked in a frame than done in the hand.           *       *       *       *       *    _Japanese Stitch_ is a modification of stem, but its peculiarity  consists in the worker taking very long stitches, and then bringing  the needle back to within a short distance of the first  starting-place; so that they may be in even parallel lines, advancing  by gradation from left to right. It is principally used for working  water or ground in a landscape.    [Illustration: No. 19.]           *       *       *       *       *    _Tambour Work_ has fallen into disuse, but was greatly admired when  our grandmothers in the last century sprigged Indian muslins or silks  with coloured flowers for dresses, and copied or adapted Indian  designs on fine linen coverlets. These were very refined, but no more  effective than a good chintz. There are exquisite specimens of the  stitch to be seen in most English homes, and in France it was in vogue  in the days of Marie Antoinette. Its use is now almost confined to  the manufacture of what is known as Irish or Limerick lace, which is  made on net in the old tambour frames, and with a tambour or crochet  hook. The frame is formed of two rings of wood or iron, made to fit  loosely one within the other. Both rings are covered with baize or  flannel wound round them till the inner one can only just be passed  through the outer. The fabric to be embroidered is placed over the  smaller hoop, and the other is pressed down over it and firmly fixed  with a screw. A small wooden frame of this description is universally  used in Ireland for white embroidery on linen or muslin. In tambour  work the thread is kept below the frame and guided by the left hand,  while the hook or crochet needle is passed from the surface through  the fabric, and brings up a loop of the thread through the preceding  stitch, and the needle again inserted, forming thus a close chain on  the surface of the work.    The difficulty of working chain stitch in a frame probably led to the  introduction of a hook for this class of embroidery.           *       *       *       *       *    Perhaps we ought not to omit all mention of the _Opus Anglicum_ or  _Anglicanum_ (English work), though it is strictly ecclesiastical, and  therefore does not enter into our province.    Dr. Rock[1] and other authorities agree in thinking that the  distinctive feature of this style, which was introduced about the end  of the thirteenth century, was a new way of working the flesh in  subjects containing figures.    Instead of the faces being worked in rows of straight stitches (like  that described as Burden stitch on page 50) as we see in the old  Flemish, German, and Italian work of the same period, the English  embroiderers invented a new stitch, which they commenced in the centre  of the cheek and worked round and round--gradually letting the lines  fall into outer circles of ordinary feather stitch.    Having thus prepared an elastic surface, they proceeded to model the  forms and make lights and shadows by pressing the work into hollows,  with small heated metal balls, the work being probably damped as a  preparation for this process. So skilfully did they carry out their  intention, that the effect is still the same after the lapse of five  centuries. We must unwillingly add that, though much appreciated in  the thirteenth century, the effect is rather curious and quaint than  beautiful."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24968"],[0,"Behind the Scenes (#7)"],[1," you harshly. Then, I may come back to Washington in a few months,  and live in the White House. The Southern people talk of choosing Mr.  Davis for their President. In fact, it may be considered settled that he  will be their President. As soon as we go South and secede from the  other States, we will raise an army and march on Washington, and then I  shall live in the White House.\"    I was bewildered with what I heard. I had served Mrs. Davis faithfully,  and she had learned to place the greatest confidence in me. At first I  was almost tempted to go South with her, for her reasoning seemed  plausible. At the time the conversation was closed, with my promise to  consider the question.    I thought over the question much, and the more I thought the less  inclined I felt to accept the proposition so kindly made by Mrs. Davis.  I knew the North to be strong, and believed that the people would fight  for the flag that they pretended to venerate so highly. The Republican  party had just emerged from a heated campaign, flushed with victory, and  I could not think that the hosts composing the party would quietly yield  all they had gained in the Presidential canvass. A show of war from the  South, I felt, would lead to actual war in the North; and with the two  sections bitterly arrayed against each other, I preferred to cast my lot  among the people of the North.    I parted with Mrs. Davis kindly, half promising to join her in the South  if further deliberation should induce me to change my views. A few weeks  before she left Washington I made two chintz wrappers for her. She said  that she must give up expensive dressing for a while; and that she, with  the Southern people, now that war was imminent, must learn to practise  lessons of economy. She left some fine needle-work in my hands, which I  finished, and forwarded to her at Montgomery, Alabama, in the month of  June, through the assistance of Mrs. Emory, one of her oldest and best  friends.    Since bidding them good-by at Washington, early in the year 1860, I have  never met any of the Davis family. Years of excitement, years of  bloodshed, and hundreds of thousands of graves intervene between the  months I spent in the family and now. The years have brought many  changes; and in view of these terrible changes even I, who was once a  slave, who have been punished with the cruel lash, who have experienced  the heart and soul tortures of a slave's life, can say to Mr. Jefferson  Davis, \"Peace! you have suffered! Go in peace.\"    In the winter of 1865 I was in Chicago, and one day visited the great  charity fair held for the benefit of the families of those soldiers who  were killed or wounded during the war. In one part of the building was a  wax figure of Jefferson Davis, wearing over his other garments the dress  in which it was reported that he was captured. There was always a great  crowd around this figure, and I was naturally attracted towards it. I  worked my way to the figure, and in examining the dress made the  pleasing discovery that it was one of the chintz wrappers that I had  made for Mrs. Davis, a short time before she departed from Washington  for the South. When it was announced that I recognized the dress as one  that I had made for the wife of the late Confederate President there was  great cheering and excitement, and I at once became the object of the  deepest curiosity. Great crowds followed me, and in order to escape from  the embarrassing situation I left the building.    I believe it now is pretty well established that Mr. Davis had on a  water-proof cloak instead of a dress, as first reported, when he was  captured. This does not invalidate any portion of my story. The dress on  the wax figure at the fair in Chicago unquestionably was one of the  chintz wrappers that I made for Mrs. Davis in January, 1860, in  Washington; and I infer, since it was not found on the body of the  fugitive President of the South, it was taken from the trunks of Mrs.  Davis, captured at the same time. Be this as it may, the coincidence is  none the less striking and curious.          CHAPTER V    MY INTRODUCTION TO MRS. LINCOLN      Ever since arriving in Washington I had a great desire to work for the  ladies of the White House, and to accomplish this end I was ready to  make almost any sacrifice consistent with propriety. Work came in  slowly, and I was beginning to feel very much embarrassed, for I did not  know how I was to meet the bills staring me in the face. It is true, the  bills were small, but then they were formidable to me, who had little or  nothing to pay them with. While in this situation I called at the  Ringolds, where I met Mrs. Captain Lee. Mrs. L. was in a state bordering  on excitement, as the great event of the season, the dinner-party given  in honor of the Prince of Wales, was soon to come off, and she must have  a dress suitable for the occasion. The silk had been purchased, but a  dress-maker had not yet been found. Miss Ringold recommended me, and I  received the order to make the dress. When I called on Mrs. Lee the next  day, her husband was in the room, and handing me a roll of bank bills,  amounting to one hundred dollars, he requested me to purchase the  trimmings, and to spare no expense in making a selection. With the money  in my pocket I went out in the street, entered the store of Harper &  Mitchell, and asked to look at their laces. Mr. Harper waited on me  himself, and was polite and kind. When I asked permission to carry the  laces to Mrs. Lee, in order to learn whether she could approve my  selection or not, he gave a ready assent. When I reminded him that I was  a stranger, and that the goods were valuable, he remarked that he was  not afraid to trust me--that he believed my face was the index to an  honest heart. It was pleasant to be spoken to thus, and I shall never  forget the kind words of Mr. Harper. I often recall them, for they are  associated with the dawn of a brighter period in my dark life. I  purchased the trimmings, and Mr. Harper allowed me a commission of  twenty-five dollars on the purchase. The dress was done in time, and it  gave complete satisfaction. Mrs. Lee attracted great attention at the  dinner-party, and her elegant dress proved a good card for me. I  received numerous orders, and was relieved from all pecuniary  embarrassments. One of my patrons was Mrs. Gen. McClean, a daughter of  Gen. Sumner. One day when I was very busy, Mrs. McC. drove up to my  apartments, came in where I was engaged with my needle, and in her  emphatic way said:    \"Lizzie, I am invited to dine at Willard's on next Sunday, and  positively I have not a dress fit to wear on the occasion. I have just  purchased material, and you must commence work on it right away.\"    \"But Mrs. McClean,\" I replied, \"I have more work now promised than I can  do. It is impossible for me to make a dress for you to wear on Sunday  next.\"    \"Pshaw! Nothing is impossible. I must have the dress made by Sunday;\"  and she spoke with some impatience.    \"I am sorry,\" I began, but she interrupted me.    \"Now don't say no again. I tell you that you must make the dress. I have  often heard you say that you would like to work for the ladies of the  White House. Well, I have it in my power to obtain you this privilege. I  know Mrs. Lincoln well, and you shall make a dress for her provided you  finish mine in time to wear at dinner on Sunday.\"    The inducement was the best that could have been offered. I would  undertake the dress if I should have to sit up all night--every night,  to make my pledge good. I sent out and employed assistants, and, after  much worry and trouble, the dress was completed to the satisfaction of  Mrs. McClean. It appears that Mrs. Lincoln had upset a cup of coffee on  the dress she designed wearing on the evening of the reception after the  inauguration of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States, which  rendered it necessary that she should have a new one for the occasion.  On asking Mrs. McClean who her dress-maker was, that lady promptly  informed her,    \"Lizzie Keckley.\"    \"Lizzie Keckley? The name is familiar to me. She used to work for some  of my lady friends in St. Louis, and they spoke well of her. Can you  recommend her to me?\"    \"With confidence. Shall I send her to you?\"    \"If you please. I shall feel under many obligations for your kindness.\"    The next Sunday Mrs. McClean sent me a message to call at her house at  four o'clock P.M., that day. As she did not state why I was to call, I  determined to wait till Monday morning. Monday morning came, and nine  o'clock found me at Mrs. McC.'s house. The streets of the capital were  thronged with people, for this was Inauguration day. A new President, a  man of the people from the broad prairies of the West, was to accept the  solemn oath of office, was to assume the responsibilities attached to  the high position of Chief Magistrate of the United States. Never was  such deep interest felt in the inauguration proceedings as was felt  today; for threats of assassination had been made, and every breeze from  the South came heavily laden with the rumors of war. Around Willard's  hotel swayed an excited crowd, and it was with the utmost difficulty  that I worked my way to the house on the opposite side of the street,  occupied by the McCleans. Mrs. McClean was out, but presently an aide on  General McClean's staff called, and informed me that I was wanted at  Willard's. I crossed the street, and on entering the hotel was met by  Mrs. McClean, who greeted me:    \"Lizzie, why did you not come yesterday, as I requested? Mrs. Lincoln  wanted to see you, but I fear that now you are too late.\"    \"I am sorry, Mrs. McClean. You did not say what you wanted with me  yesterday, so I judged that this morning would do as well.\"    \"You should have come yesterday,\" she insisted. \"Go up to Mrs. Lincoln's  room\"--giving me the number--\"she may find use for you"]]]
