The marquis de Chauvelin was equally skilful as a warrior and  diplomatist. Gentle, graceful, and witty, he joined to the most extreme  versatility of talent the utmost simplicity of character. Once known,  he could not fail of being valued and esteemed, and the king entertained  the most lively regard for him. The noble minded marquis was far from  taking advantage of his sovereign's favor, far from it; he neither  boasted of it, nor presumed upon it. This truly wonderful man died,  unhappily, too soon for me, for the king on whom he bestowed the sagest  counsels, and for foreign courts who knew and appreciated his worth.  I shall have occasion to speak of him hereafter; he had a brother, a  wicked little hump-backed creature, brave as Caesar, and a bitter enemy  to the Jesuits, whom he did not a little contribute to overturn in the  parliament of Paris, to which he belonged. The king detested this man  as much as he loved and cherished the brother, and that is saying not a  little.    The fourth guest was the duc de la Vauguyon, the really _perpetual_  tutor to the princes of France, for he had educated four successively.  He had displayed in the army both bravery and talent, but he was a  confirmed Jesuit, and conducted himself towards me upon the strictest  principles of his order. He will appear again on the scene hereafter,  but for the present I must lay him aside, whilst I return to my _entree_  to the saloon, which I was about to enter.    Immediately after Lebel had conducted me into it, he was called away,  and quitted us. The king rose and approached me, saluting me with the  most admirable gallantry, and addressing to me the most encouraging and  gratifying words. His gentle, yet polished manners, fine countenance,  noble air, and the free and unrestrained glances of admiration which  sparkled in his eyes, communicated to me a feeling of support and  confidence which effectually reassured me, and roused me from the  involuntary emotion I had felt at the moment when I first appeared in  his presence. The king addressed a few words to comte Jean, and then  regarded him steadily, as tho' he were trying to recall his features;  but his eye quickly turned on me again, upon whom he bestowed the most  intoxicating attention. Never was first sight more effective, and never  did a flame so rapidly increase as did the passion of my noble adorer.  Ere we had seated ourselves at the supper-table, he was ages gone in  love.    It would have provoked a smile from any countenance to perceive how  the respect and admiration with which the three courtiers regarded  me increased in proportion as the sentiments of the king towards me  betrayed themselves more and more. At first I had been considered as  a person of little or no importance. Soon, however, as their sagacious  eyes discovered the state of their master's mind, the air of familiarity  with which they had regarded me gave place to a more studied politeness,  which, in its turn, as matters progressed, was superseded by the most  delicate attention; and ere we rose from table these gentlemen watched  my looks with the most eager anxiety to obtain the honor of my notice,  and hopes of future patronage from one whom they easily foresaw would be  fully qualified to bestow it. Comte Jean observed all that was passing  in profound silence. As for me, I talked and laughed with perfect  freedom from restraint, and my frank unaffected mirth appeared to  enchant the king; I knew that he was weary of the nice formalities of  courtly beauty, and desired to refresh his eyes and ears with something  less refined, and I gratified him to his heart's wish. The conversation  became lively and animated, the merits of men of letters were discussed,  the French and Italian theatre passed in review before us, and finally,  we amused ourselves with anecdotes relative to the intrigues of court.  The baron de Gonesse related to us a circumstance which had just been  communicated to him by a county magistrate. I must here apprize the  reader that these administrators of justice were directed to collect all  the facts, scandalous, horrible, ridiculous, or piquant, which occurred  within their jurisdiction, in order that, being forwarded to the  king, they might aid in distracting his mind from the heavy cares of  government. Alas! how many strange and eventful things have I since  learned by similar channels.    The supper terminated, the king's friends remained some time conversing  with us. Whilst these noblemen were busily celebrating my praises in  words sufficiently loud to reach the king's ear, the baron de Gonesse,  standing by my side, was prosecuting his suit in the most ardent terms.  I received his overtures with becoming grace and modesty. As I have  before said, the exterior of the king was very prepossessing, and what  he wanted in youth, he made up by all the mature graces of dignified  royalty. At last Lebel appeared, and made me a sign to rise from my  seat. Up to this period nothing had arisen to betray the incognito of  the august monarch, and in order to keep up my pretended ignorance  of his grandeur, I quitted the apartment with little ceremony. Lebel  conducted me to an adjoining chamber, furnished with the utmost  magnificence. When we were seated, he turned to the comte Jean, who had  followed us, and said, \"It rests with yourself whether you will return  to Paris, or remain at Versailles. But as for _milady_, who seems  much fatigued, she will, we trust, honor us by accepting a bed at the  castle.\"    My self-created brother-in-law understood as well as I did the  significance of these words, and clearly read in their import how far  I had attracted the favor of the king. In order to have rendered the  impression more lasting, we could have wished that matters had been less  precipitated, but we were under a roof where everything yielded to the  caprices of its master, and resignation to his will became a matter  of course. And here I trust I may be pardoned if I pass over certain  details which could not, at this lapse of time, interest or amuse any  one; besides, altho' I have found no difficulty in reciting former  events of my life, I find my pen more prudish and coy than were my ears  or mouth. All I shall say is, that the following day, as soon as I was  left alone in my chamber, Lebel entered, and prostrating himself at the  side of my bed,--    \"Madame la comtesse,\" said he, \"is queen and mistress here. Not only has  your noble lover failed to communicate to me the usual signal of disgust  or dislike, but he has spoken of you to me in the most favorable light,  declaring, that, for the first time in his life, he felt the influence  of a true and sincere affection; for this reason he desired I would not  convey to you the contents of this casket, as originally intended.\"    \"And what does it contain?\" asked I, with childish eagerness.    \"Oh, a trifle unworthy of her who is now the mistress of his warmest  love; only a purse containing a hundred louis, and a suit of emeralds  worth a similar sum. He bade me say it might have served to recompense a  mere fleeting fancy, but that it is unworthy of your charms, nor can he  insult you by the offer of it.\"    \"Will he then see me again?\" inquired I.    \"To-morrow evening, if agreeable to you.\"    \"Only say that his wishes are mine.\"    \"Would you wish to see the comte Jean before you rise? He has been  waiting with the utmost impatience to see you since seven o'clock this  morning.\"    \"Let him come in.\"    The comte entered, and I saw by the triumphant joy painted on his face,  that Lebel had told him of propitious state of things. He ran up to me  with outstretched arms, congratulating me upon my success, and putting  at the same time several questions, to which, either from mere womanly  caprice, or presuming upon my recent elevation to the character of prime  favorite, I refused to reply.    My folly drew down on me his severe anger, and several oaths escaped his  lips, which, echoed back by walls so unused to similar violence, struck  Lebel with terror. That faithful ally placed his hand over his mouth,  imploring of him to recollect himself, and the place he was in. As for  me, dreading some foolish burst of his impetuosity, I tried some of my  sweetest smiles, and inviting him to sit beside me, related to him and  Lebel those particulars which my pen refuses to retrace. Amongst other  things, I told them I had said to the king, that I had perfectly known  who he was all the preceding evening when supping with him, and that  he had the simplicity to say, \"he was surprised I had not appeared more  embarrassed in his presence.\"    Our conversation terminated, I wished to return to Paris, and I was,  without further hindrance, allowed to depart. Scarcely had I arrived  there an hour, than I received from his majesty a magnificent diamond  agraffe, worth at least 60,000 francs, and bank notes to the amount of  200,000 livres.    Comte Jean and myself were well nigh stupefied with astonishment at the  sight of such treasures; to us, who had never in our lives possessed  such sums, they appeared inexhaustible. My brother-in-law divided them  into two equal portions, one of which he put into his pocket, and the  other into my _escritoire_. With this arrangement I did not interfere;  nothing seemed to me more simple than that he should satisfy his need  out of my superfluity. I bestowed two thousand crowns upon Henriette,  and expended in the course of the day at least a quarter of my riches  in trifles, as unnecessary as useless; and all this without once  remembering that as I owed my present"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25646"],[0,"Child's Health Primer For Primary Classes (#7)"],[1,"d. Here, again, it is the earth that sends us our food. Fat meat  comes from animals well fed on grain and grass; sugar, from sugar-cane,  maple-trees, or beets; oil, from olive-trees; butter, from cream; and  starch, from potatoes, and from corn, rice, and other grains.    Green apples and other unripe fruits are not yet ready to be eaten. The  starch which we take for food has to be changed into sugar, before it  can mix with the blood and help feed the body. As the sun ripens fruit,  it changes its starch to sugar. You can tell this by the difference in  the taste of ripe and unripe apples.      CANDY.    Most children like candy so well, that they are in danger of eating more  sugar than is good for them. You would starve if fed only on sugar.    We would not need to be quite so much afraid of a little candy if it  were not for the poison with which it is often colored.    Even what is called pure, white candy is sometimes not really such.  There is a simple way by which you can find this out for yourselves.    If you put a spoonful of sugar into a tumbler of water, it will all  dissolve and disappear. Put a piece of white candy into a tumbler of  water; and, if it is made of pure sugar only, it will dissolve and  disappear.    If it is not, you will find at the bottom of the tumbler some white  earth. This is not good food for anybody. Candy-makers often put it  into candy in place of sugar, because it is cheaper than sugar.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. Why do we need food?              2.

[Illustration: H]ERE, at last, is the bill of fare for our dinner:              Roast beef,            Potatoes,            Tomatoes,            Squash,            Bread,            Butter,            Salt,            Water,            Peaches,            Bananas,            Oranges,            Grapes.    What must be done first, with the different kinds of food that are to  make up this dinner?    The meat, vegetables, and bread must be cooked. Cooking prepares them to  be easily worked upon by the mouth and stomach. If they were not cooked,  this work would be very hard. Instead of going on quietly and without  letting us know any thing about it, there would be pains and aches in  the overworked stomach.    The fruit is not cooked by a fire; but we might almost say the sun had  cooked it, for the sun has ripened and sweetened it.    When you are older, some of you may have charge of the cooking in your  homes. You must then remember that food well cooked is worth twice as  much as food poorly cooked.    \"A good cook has more to do with the health of the family, than a good  doctor.\"      THE SALIVA.    Next to the cooking comes the eating.    As soon as we begin to chew our food, a juice in the mouth, called  saliva (sa l[=i]'va), moistens and mixes with it.    Saliva has the wonderful power of turning starch into sugar; and the  starch in our food needs to be turned into sugar, before it can be taken  into the blood.    You can prove for yourselves that saliva can turn starch into sugar.  Chew slowly a piece of dry cracker. The cracker is made mostly of  starch, because wheat is full of starch. At first, the cracker is dry  and tasteless. Soon, however, you find it tastes sweet; the saliva is  changing the starch into sugar.    All your food should be eaten slowly and chewed well, so that the saliva  may be able to mix with it. Otherwise, the starch may not be changed;  and if one part of your body neglects its work, another part will have  more than its share to do. That is hardly fair.    If you swallow your food in a hurry and do not let the saliva do its  work, the stomach will have extra work. But it will find it hard to do  more than its own part, and, perhaps, will complain.    It can not speak in words; but will by aching, and that is almost as  plain as words.      SWALLOWING.    Next to the chewing, comes the swallowing. Is there any thing wonderful  about that?    We have two passages leading down our throats. One is to the lungs, for  breathing; the other, to the stomach, for swallowing.    Do you wonder why the food does not sometimes go down the wrong way?    The windpipe leading to the lungs is in front of the other tube. It has  at its top a little trap-door. This opens when we breathe and shuts when  we swallow, so that the food slips over it safely into the passage  behind, which leads to the stomach.    If you try to speak while you have food in your mouth, this little door  has to open, and some bit of food may slip in. The windpipe will not  pass it to the lungs, but tries to force it back. Then we say the food  chokes us. If the windpipe can not succeed in forcing back the food, the  person will die.      HOW THE FOOD IS CARRIED THROUGH THE BODY.    But we will suppose that the food of our dinner has gone safely down  into the stomach. There the stomach works it over, and mixes in gastric  juice, until it is all a gray fluid.    Now it is ready to go into the intestines,--a long, coiled tube which  leads out of the stomach,--from which the prepared food is taken into  the blood.    The blood carries it to the heart. The heart pumps it out with the blood  into the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle,  and skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain.    Besides feeding all these parts, this dinner can help to mend any parts  that may be broken.    Suppose a boy should break one of the bones of his arm, how could it be  mended?    If you should bind together the two parts of a broken stick and leave  them a while, do you think they would grow together?    No, indeed!    But the doctor could carefully bind together the ends of the broken bone  in the boy's arm and leave it for awhile, and the blood would bring it  bone food every day, until it had grown together again.    So a dinner can both make and mend the different parts of the body.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. What shall we have for dinner?              2.

[Illustration: H]ERE are the names of some of the different kinds of  food. If you write them on the blackboard or on your slates, it will  help you to remember them.                      _Water._ _Salt._ _Lime._              Meat,  }                 Sugar,  }            Milk,  }                 Starch, }            Eggs,  }                 Fat,    } for fat and heat.

Cream,  }            Corn,  }                 Oil,    }            Oats,  }    Perhaps some of you noticed that we had no wine, beer, nor any drink  that had alcohol in it, on our bill of fare for dinner. We had no  cigars, either, to be smoked after dinner. If these are good things, we  ought to have had them. Why did we leave them out?              _We should eat in order to grow strong and keep            strong._      STRENGTH OF BODY.    If you wanted to measure your strength, one way of doing so would be to  fasten a heavy weight to one end of a rope and pass the rope over a  pulley. Then you might take hold at the other end of the rope and pull  as hard and steadily as you could, marking the place to which you raised  the weight. By trying this once a week, or once a month, you could tell  by the marks, whether you were gaining strength.    But how can we gain strength?    We must exercise in the open air, and take pure air into our lungs to  help purify our blood, and plenty of exercise to make our muscles grow.    We must eat good and simple food, that the blood may have supplies to  take to every part of the body.      ALCOHOL AND STRENGTH.    People used to think that alcohol made them strong.    Can alcohol make good muscles, or bone, or nerve, or brain?    You have already answered \"No!\" to each of these questions.    If it can not make muscles, nor bone nor nerve, nor brain, it can not  give you any strength.      BEER.    Some people may tell you that drinking beer will make you strong.    The grain from which the beer is made, would have given you strength. If  you should"]]]
