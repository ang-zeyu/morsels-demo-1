Andrews    [TR: No Date Stamp]    SARAH LOUISE AUGUSTUS  Age 80 years  1424 Lane Street  Raleigh, North Carolina      I wus born on a plantation near Fayetteville, N. C., and I belonged to  J. B. Smith. His wife wus named Henrietta. He owned about thirty slaves.  When a slave was no good he wus put on the auction block in Fayetteville  and sold.    My father wus named Romeo Harden and my mother wus named Alice Smith.  The little cabin where I wus born is still standing.    There wus seven children in marster's family, four girls and two boys.  The girls wus named Ellen, Ida, Mary and Elizabeth. The boys wus named  Harry, Norman and Marse George. Marse George went to the war. Mother had  a family of four girls. Their names wus: Mary, Kate, Hannah and myself,  Sarah Louise. I am the only one living and I would not be living but I  have spent most of my life in white folk's houses and they have looked  after me. I respected myself and they respected me.    My first days of slavery wus hard. I slept on a pallet on the floor of  the cabin and just as soon as I wus able to work any at all I wus put  to milking cows.    I have seen the paterollers hunting men and have seen men they had  whipped. The slave block stood in the center of the street, Fayetteville  Street, where Ramsey and Gillespie Street came in near Cool Springs  Street. The silk mill stood just below the slave market. I saw the  silkworms that made the silk and saw them gather the cocoons and spin  the silk.    They hung people in the middle of Ramsey Street. They put up a gallows  and hung the men exactly at 12 o'clock.    I ran away from the plantation once to go with some white children to  see a man hung.    The only boats I remember on the Cape Fear wus the Governor Worth, The  Hurt, The Iser and The North State. Oh! Lord yes, I remember the stage  coach. As many times as I run to carry the mail to them when they come  by! They blew a horn before they got there and you had to be on time  'cause they could not wait. There wus a stage each way each day, one up  and one down.    Mr. George Lander had the first Tombstone Marble yard in Fayetteville  on Hay Street on the point of Flat Iron place. Lander wus from Scotland.  They gave me a pot, a scarf, and his sister gave me some shells. I have  all the things they gave me. My missus, Henrietta Smith, wus Mr.  Lander's sister. I waited on the Landers part of the time. They were  hard working white folks, honest, God fearing people. The things they  gave me were brought from over the sea.    I can remember when there wus no hospital in Fayetteville. There wus a  little place near the depot where there wus a board shanty where they  operated on people. I stood outside once and saw the doctors take a  man's leg off. Dr. McDuffy wus the man who took the leg off. He lived on  Hay Street near the Silk Mill.    When one of the white folks died they sent slaves around to the homes  of their friends and neighbors with a large sheet of paper with a piece  of black crepe pinned to the top of it. The friends would sign or make a  cross mark on it. The funerals were held at the homes and friends and  neighbors stood on the porch and in the house while the services were  going on. The bodies were carried to the grave after the services in a  black hearse drawn by black horses. If they did not have black horses to  draw the hearse they went off and borrowed them. The colored people  washed and shrouded the dead bodies. My grandmother wus one who did  this. Her name wus Sarah McDonald. She belonged to Capt. George  McDonald. She had fifteen children and lived to be one hundred and ten  years old. She died in Fayetteville of pneumonia. She wus in Raleigh  nursing the Briggs family, Mrs. F. H. Briggs' family. She wus going home  to Fayetteville when she wus caught in a rain storm at Sanford, while  changing trains. The train for Fayetteville had left as the train for  Sanford wus late so she stayed wet all night. Next day she went home,  took pneumonia and died. She wus great on curing rheumatism; she did it  with herbs. She grew hops and other herbs and cured many people of this  disease.    She wus called black mammy because she wet nursed so many white  children. In slavery time she nursed all babies hatched on her marster's  plantation and kept it up after the war as long as she had children.    Grandfather wus named Isaac Fuller. Mrs. Mary Ann Fuller, Kate Fuller,  Mr. Will Fuller, who wus a lawyer in Wall Street, New York, is some of  their white folks. The Fullers were born in Fayetteville. One of the  slaves, Dick McAlister, worked, saved a small fortune and left it to  Mr. Will Fuller. People thought the slave ought to have left it to his  sister but he left it to Mr. Will. Mr. Fuller gives part of it to the  ex-slaves sister each year. Mr. Will always helped the Negroes out when  he could. He was good to Dick and Dick McAlister gave him all his  belongings when he died.    The Yankees came through Fayetteville wearing large blue coats with  capes on them. Lots of them were mounted, and there were thousands of  foot soldiers. It took them several days to get through town. The  Southern soldiers retreated and then in a few hours the Yankees covered  the town. They busted into the smokehouse at marstar's, took the meat,  meal and other provisions. Grandmother pled with the Yankees but it did  no good. They took all they wanted. They said if they had to come again  they would take the babies from the cradles. They told us we were all  free. The Negroes begun visiting each other in the cabins and became so  excited they began to shout and pray. I thought they were all crazy.    We stayed right on with marster. He had a town house and a big house on  the plantation. I went to the town house to work, but mother and  grandmother stayed on the plantation. My mother died there and the  white folks buried her. Father stayed right on and helped run the farm  until he died. My uncle, Elic Smith, and his family stayed too.  Grandfather and grandmother after a few years left the plantation and  went to live on a little place which Mrs. Mary Ann Fuller gave them.  Grandmother and grandfather died there.    I wus thirty years old when I married. I wus married in my missus'  graduating dress. I wus married in the white folks' church, to James  Henry Harris. The white folks carried me there and gave me away. Miss  Mary Smith gave me away. The wedding wus attended mostly by white  folks.    My husband wus a fireman on the Cape Fear river boats and a white man's  Negro too. We had two children, both died while little. My husband and I  spent much of our time with the white folks and when he wus on his runs  I slept in their homes. Often the children of the white families slept  with me. We both tried to live up to the standards of decency and  honesty and to be worthy of the confidence placed in us by our white  folks.    My husband wus finally offered a job with a shipping concern in  Deleware and we moved there. He wus fireman on the freighter  Wilmington. He worked there three years, when he wus drowned. After his  death I married David Augustus and immediately came back to North  Carolina and my white folks, and we have been here ever since. I am a  member of several Negro Lodges and am on the Committee for the North  Carolina Colored State Fair.    There are only a few of the old white folks who have always been good  to me living now, but I am still working with their offspring, among  whom I have some mighty dear friends. I wus about eight years old when  Sherman's Army came through. Guess I am about eighty years of age now.    AC          N. C. District: No. 2                    [320261]  Worker:         T.

C.      I wus borned in the year 1852, July 27. I wus born in Granville County,  sold to a slave speculator at ten years old and carried to Southwest,  Georgia. I belonged to Samuel Howard. His daughter took me to Kinston,  North Carolina and I stayed there until I wus sold. She married a man  named Bill Brown, and her name wus Julia Howard Brown. My father wus  named Paul Howard and my mother wus named Chollie Howard. My old missus  wus named Polly Howard.    John Richard Keine from Danville, Virginia bought me and sent me to a  plantation in Georgia. We only had a white overseer there. He and his  wife and children lived on the plantation. We had slave quarters there.  Slaves were bought up and sent there in chains. Some were chained to  each other by the legs, some by the arms. They called the leg chains  shackles. I have lived a hard life. I have seen mothers sold away from  their babies and other children, and they cryin' when she left. I have  seen husbands sold from their wives, and wives sold from their husbands.    Abraham Lincoln came through once, but none of us knew who he wus. He  wus just the raggedest man you ever saw. The white children and me saw  him out at the railroad. We were settin' and waitin' to see him. He said  he wus huntin' his people; and dat he had lost all he had. Dey give him  somethin' to eat and tobacco to chew, and he went on. Soon we heard he  wus in de White House then we knew who it wus come through. We knowed  den it wus Abraham Lincoln.    We"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22990"],[0,"Historical Sketch of the Cathedral of Strasburg (#7)"],[1,"the chapel of  the Augustines, erected in 1378; it was placed in the crypta in  1683.    The most ancient of the present chapels of the Cathedral is that  of Saint-Andrew, in the South aisle of the chancel; it is  remarkable for the details of its columns and for its ornaments  of a very old style; it contains the tombs of several bishops,  the oldest of which is that of Henry of Hasenburg, who died in  1190. Behind the North aisle of the chancel, is Saint-John the  Baptist's chapel, also very old, and being now lower than the  pavement of the Cathedral. Besides several epitaphs, one here  sees the fine gothic sepulchre of bishop Conrad of Lichtenberg,  who died in 1299. The colossal statue of that prelate lies on a  stone and has still some marks of the colours with which it had  formerly been painted; in one hand he holds a book, in the other  was his crosier of which only the lower part is now left; his  head covered with the mitre rests on a cushion and his feet lie  against a lion[1]. Near the entrance of this chapel, surrounded  by an elegant railing, is the baptismal-font of sculptured stone,  the master-piece of Josse Dotzinger of Worms, who died in 1449.      [1] The epitaph of Conrad is as follows:           \"_Anno domini MCCLXXXXIX kal. Augusti obiit Conradus         secundus de Lichtenberg natus, Argentinensis episcopus,         hic sepultus. Qui omnibus bonis condicionibus, quae in         homine mundiali debent concurrere, eminebat; nec sibi         visus similis est in illis. Sedit autem annis XXV et         mensibus sex. Orate pro eo._\"    The first chapel built in the Cathedral was Saint-Lawrence's,  next to the North portal of the transept. It was the oldest  parish in the town and diocese of Strasburg; the vicar of  Saint-Lawrence was the first archpriest of the diocese and at the  same time grand-penitentiary of the Cathedral. This chapel,  decayed with time, was rebuilt after the plans of master James of  Landshut, who died in 1495, and was completed in 1505; when in  the course of time it became too small for the parish, it was  transferred in 1698 into the neighbouring chapel of Saint-Martin,  which had been built in 1420 and then assumed the name of  Saint-Lawrence's chapel that it retained ever since. Among the  sepulchral monuments it contains, is seen that of Mr. de la  Batie, in his live time commander of Strasburg. In this chapel is  the entrance to the vaults, where to this day the bishops' mortal  remains are deposited.    The chapel opposite the latter, on the right side of the church,  is dedicated to saint Catharine; it was erected in the year 1331  by bishop Berthold of Bucheck who is interred in it. It was newly  arched in 1542 and formerly contained the holy tomb. The  entrances both into this and the chapel of Saint-Lawrence are  decorated with several old statues; in Saint-Catharine's chapel  is the tomb of Conrad Bock, a nobleman of Strasburg, who died in  1480; this work is remarkable for the manner in which the  numerous figures that surround the bed of the dying man, are  grouped together.    The sepulchral stones that served as flag-stones or pavement in  the interior of this large building, have long ago been removed.  Besides the sepulchral monuments and inscriptions already  mentioned we shall note the epitaphs of Erwin of Steinbach, of  Husa his wife, and of his son John, at the lower part of the  buttress in the little yard behind Saint John's chapel[1]; also  the inscription to the memory of Conrad Guertler, who bequeathed  to the chapter of the Cathedral his house, a large building in  the rue du Dome; this inscription is opposite that of Geiler of  Kaysersberg; finally, in one of the vestries is the epitaph, in  german verses, of the celebrated printer John Mentelin of  Schlestadt.      [1] _Anno domini MCCCXVI. XII Kal. Augustii obiit Domina    Husa uxor magistri Erwini. Anno domini MCCCXVIII. XVI Kal.    Februarii obiit magister Erwinus gubernator fabrice ecclessie    Argentinensis. Anno domini MCCCXXXVIII. XV Kal. Aprilis obiit    magister Johanni (sic) filius Erwini magistri operi huius    ecclesie._--There was formerly on that spot a burial ground; it    is very likely that Erwin and his family were buried there. When    some years ago, they were digging a waste-well for the lightning    conductor, they discovered an old coffin of stone, broken and    filled with earth and bones. All these remains with the exception    of some fragments taken away by some curious amateurs, were    deposited in a vault.    We shall add one word more on the _foundations_ of the Cathedral.  Every one knows the old story, according to which this edifice  rests on piles, between each of which it were possible to go in  boats on canals extending even under the place Gutenberg. As far  back as the seventeenth century, they dug to a considerable  depth, and have since several times renewed the experiments, to  ascertain the nature of the foundations, that have been found to  lie very deep and to be very solid, formed of masonry reposing on  clay mixed with gravel; under a portion of the nave this bottom  is reinforced by oaken piles.    Through a door on the right of saint Catharine's chapel you enter  the area of the workhouse of the stone-cutters of the Cathedral  (_Steinhuette_). These workmen, even to this day form a particular  corporation that seems to have originated in the days of Erwin of  Steinbach; at all events it is a certain fact that the masons of  the Cathedral were from the beginning a body, distinct from the  ordinary masons; that they have not admitted among them every  one who presented himself, and that they had secret signs to know  one another. This (_loge_) society of the masons of the Cathedral  has become the cause of many others in Germany; Dotzinger, the  successor of John Hueltz as architect of this church, united them  all in one body; a general meeting of the masters or chiefs of  the different _loges_, held at Ratisbon in 1459, adopted certain  rules and regulations, and chose as their grand-masters the  architects of the Cathedral of Strasburg, where the principal  loge or lodge (_Haupthuette_) was established. Maximilian I  confirmed the establishment and the rules of this corporation on  the 3d October 1498. At the beginning of the eighteenth century  it was transferred to Mayence.    It has already been stated that at a very remote period the  Cathedral had received rich and important donations composing the  _[OE]uvre-Notre-Dame_, the revenues of which were originally  under the direction of the bishops; but as they squandered them  away \"leaving the building to decay,\" the chapter assumed their  administration in 1263, after the war between the town and Walter  of Geroldseck; however, the canons did no better and in 1290 the  magistrate of the city was obliged to take back from them the  management of the revenues. The estate and income of the  _[OE]uvre_, employed only for keeping in good order and for  repairing the Cathedral church, are still managed like other  property that belongs to the city; the collector of the revenues  is appointed by the city corporation, who also names the  architect and sculptor of the _[OE]uvre_. The receiver's office  is in a handsome house (_Frauenhaus_), built in 1581, after the  taste of those times, situated opposite the South side of the  Cathedral. In that house, where the old plans of the church and  the pieces of the old clockwork, above mentioned, are carefully  preserved, we have also to admire the light and elegant  construction of the staircase.              *      *      *      *      *          TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES      The following changes have been made as needed to facilitate  reading: standardized punctuation and accents, moved  illustrations, and renumbered and moved footnotes.
