They baptized  sinners, young and old, without demanding repentance. They sold the  Communion to rascals and rogues, like a huckstress offering her wares.  They abused Confession by pardoning men who never intended to amend  their evil ways. They allowed men of the vilest character to be ordained  as priests. They degraded marriage by preaching the doctrine that it was  less holy than celibacy. They distorted the original design of Extreme  Unction, for instead of using it to heal the sick they used it to line  their own pockets. And all these blasphemies, sins and follies were the  offspring of that adulterous union between the Church and the State,  which began in the days of Constantine the Great. For of all the evils  under Heaven, the greatest, said Peter, was that contradiction in  terms--a State Church.    He attacked the great theologians and scholars. Instead of using their  mental powers in the search for truth, these college men, said Peter,  had done their best to suppress the truth; and at the two great Councils  of Constance and Basle, they had actually obtained the help of the  temporal power to crush all who dared to hold different views from  theirs. What use, asked Peter, were these learned pundits? They were no  use at all. They never instructed anybody. \"I do not know,\" he said,  \"a single person whom they have helped with their learning.\" Had they  instructed Hus? No. Hus had the faith in himself; Hus was instructed by  God; and all that these ravens did for Hus was to flock together against  him.    Again, Peter denounced the Bohemian nobles. As we read his biting,  satirical phrases we can see that he was no respecter of persons and  no believer in artificial distinctions of rank. For him the only  distinction worth anything was the moral distinction between those who  followed the crucified Jesus and those who rioted in selfish pleasures.    He had no belief in blue blood and noble birth. He was almost, though  not quite, a Socialist. He had no definite, constructive social policy.  He was rather a champion of the rights of the poor, and an apostle of  the simple life. \"The whole value of noble birth,\" he said, \"is founded  on a wicked invention of the heathen, who obtained coats of arms from  emperors or kings as a reward for some deed of valour.\" If a man could  only buy a coat of arms--a stag, a gate, a wolf's head, or a sausage--he  became thereby a nobleman, boasted of his high descent, and was regarded  by the public as a saint. For such \"nobility\" Peter had a withering  contempt. He declared that nobles of this stamp had no right to belong  to the Christian Church. They lived, he said, in flat opposition to the  spirit of Jesus Christ. They devoured the poor. They were a burden to  the country. They did harm to all men. They set their minds on worldly  glory, and spent their money on extravagant dress. \"The men,\" said he,  \"wear capes reaching down to the ground, and their long hair falls down  to their shoulders; and the women wear so many petticoats that they  can hardly drag themselves along, and strut about like the Pope's  courtezans, to the surprise and disgust of the whole world.\" What right  had these selfish fops to call themselves Christians? They did more harm  to the cause of Christ than all the Turks and heathens in the world.    Thus Peter, belonging to none of the sects, found grievous faults in  them all. As he always mentions the Waldenses with respect, it has been  suggested that he was a Waldensian himself. But of that there is no real  proof. He had, apparently, no organizing skill; he never attempted to  form a new sect or party, and his mission in the world was to throw  out hints and leave it to others to carry these hints into practice.  He condemned the Utraquists because they used the sword. \"If a man,\" he  said, \"eats a black pudding on Friday, you blame him; but if he sheds  his brother's blood on the scaffold or on the field of battle you  praise him.\" He condemned the Taborites because they made light of the  Sacraments. \"You have called the Holy Bread,\" he said, \"a butterfly, a  bat, an idol. You have even told the people that it is better to kneel  to the devil than to kneel at the altar; and thus you have taught them  to despise religion and wallow in unholy lusts.\" He condemned the King  for being a King at all; for no intelligent man, said Peter, could  possibly be a King and a Christian at the same time. And finally he  condemned the Pope as Antichrist and the enemy of God.    Yet Peter was something more than a caustic critic. For the terrible  ills of his age and country he had one plain and homely remedy, and that  for all true Christians to leave the Church of Rome and return to the  simple teaching of Christ and His Apostles. If the reader goes to Peter  for systematic theology, he will be grievously disappointed; but if he  goes for moral vigour, he will find a well-spread table.    He did not reason his positions out like Wycliffe; he was a suggestive  essayist rather than a constructive philosopher; and, radical though  he was in some of his views, he held firm to what he regarded as  the fundamental articles of the Christian faith. He believed in the  redemptive value of the death of Christ. He believed that man must build  his hopes, not so much on his own good works, but rather on the grace  of God. He believed, all the same, that good works were needed and  would receive their due reward. He believed, further, in the real  bodily presence of Christ in the Sacrament; and on this topic he held  a doctrine very similar to Luther's doctrine of Consubstantiation. But,  over and above all these beliefs, he insisted, in season and out of  season, that men could partake of spiritual blessings without the aid  of Roman priests. Some fruit of his labours he saw. As the fire of  the Hussite Wars died down, a few men in different parts of the  country--especially at Chelcic, Wilenow and Divischau--began to take  Peter as their spiritual guide. They read his pamphlets with delight,  became known as the \"Brethren of Chelcic,\" and wore a distinctive dress,  a grey cloak with a cord tied round the waist. The movement spread, the  societies multiplied, and thus, in a way no records tell, were laid the  foundations of the Church of the Brethren. Did Peter see that Church? We  do not know. No one knows when Peter was born, and no one knows when  he died. He delivered his message; he showed the way; he flashed his  lantern in the darkness; and thus, whether he knew it or not, he was the  literary founder of the Brethren's Church. He fired the hope. He drew  the plans. It was left to another man to erect the building.          CHAPTER V. -- GREGORY THE PATRIARCH AND THE SOCIETY AT KUNWALD, 1457-1473.    A brilliant idea is an excellent thing. A man to work it out is still  better. At the very time when Peter's followers were marshalling their  forces, John Rockycana,[5] Archbishop-elect of Prague (since 1448), was  making a mighty stir in that drunken city. What Peter had done with his  pen, Rockycana was doing with his tongue. He preached Peter's doctrines  in the great Thein Church; he corresponded with him on the burning  topics of the day; he went to see him at his estate; he recommended his  works to his hearers; and week by week, in fiery language, he denounced  the Church of Rome as Babylon, and the Pope as Antichrist himself. His  style was vivid and picturesque, his language cutting and clear. One day  he compared the Church of Rome to a burned and ruined city, wherein the  beasts of the forests made their lairs; and, again, he compared her to  a storm-tossed ship, which sank beneath the howling waves because the  sailors were fighting each other. \"It is better,\" he said, \"to tie a dog  to a pulpit than allow a priest to defile it. It is better, oh, women!  for your sons to be hangmen than to be priests; for the hangman only  kills the body, while the priest kills the soul. Look there,\" he  suddenly exclaimed one Sunday, pointing to a picture of St. Peter on the  wall, \"there is as much difference between the priests of to-day and the  twelve apostles as there is between that old painting and the living St.  Peter in heaven.[6] For the priests have put the devil into the sacraments  themselves, and are leading you straight to the fires of Hell.\"    If an eloquent speaker attacks the clergy, he is sure to draw a crowd.  No wonder the Thein Church was crammed. No wonder the people listened  with delight as he backed up his hot attack with texts from the prophet  Jeremiah. No wonder they cried in their simple zeal: \"Behold, a second  John Hus has arisen.\"    But John Rockycana was no second John Hus. For all his fire in the  pulpit, he was only a craven at heart. \"If a true Christian,\" said he  to a friend, \"were to turn up now in Prague, he would be gaped at like  a stag with golden horns.\" But he was not a stag with golden horns  himself. As he thundered against the Church of Rome, he was seeking,  not the Kingdom of God, but his own fame and glory. His followers soon  discovered his weakness. Among those who thronged to hear his sermons  were certain quiet men of action, who were not content to paw the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21003"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Ely (#7)"],[1," arches which have been inserted beneath the Norman  arches of the west tower. The triforium walls in the nave were raised in  the fifteenth century, as those in the presbytery had been raised in  the fourteenth. The style of the tracery shews that this alteration was  carried out quite late in the century, perhaps about 1480. In the south  transept there is also a large Perpendicular window. The very late east  window of the south presbytery aisle was inserted as part of Bishop  West's Chapel, who died in 1533.    In 1539 the monastery was surrendered to the king. Such of the domestic  buildings as were not required for the use of the dean and canons were  as usual sold. The Constitution of Henry VIII. provided for the  customary officers of a cathedral establishment. The prior became the  first dean, and remained in office till his death, eighteen years later.  Though the minster had become a cathedral when the bishopric was  instituted, yet the prior and convent were always custodians of the  fabric, and apparently supreme therein; and there was nothing strictly  corresponding to a capitular body. A memory of the fact that the bishop  was in place of the abbot remains to this day in the position of the  bishop's seat in the choir. There is no throne, properly so called. The  bishop occupies what is in most cathedrals the dean's seat--on the south  of the entrance at the screen. The north side is in consequence the  Decani side, and the Cantoris side is on the south. This position of the  dean's stall on the north, though very unusual, is not unique. It occurs  also at Durham and Carlisle; but at those cathedrals there is a throne  for the bishop, and the bishop's seat in a stall in the south,  corresponding to the dean's in the north, is not met with elsewhere. \"At  Ely alone, of all cathedrals in Christendom, owing to its first bishop  having been an abbot who was himself the banished bishop of another see,  the diocesan has continued to occupy the abbot's stall, while the head  of the corporation (before the Reformation a prior, and since then a  dean) has occupied the opposite stall, usually assigned to a sub-prior  or sub-dean.\"[18] There were three Benedictine abbeys which retained  their monastic establishment after a bishop had been made and the  minster became a cathedral--Canterbury, Durham, and Ely.    It is always taken for granted that the destruction of the beautiful  work in the lady-chapel, as well as of the shrines and statuary in the  cathedral, was effected very soon after the dissolution of the  monastery; but precise authority for this seems not to be forthcoming.  It is known that Bishop Goodrich was an ardent supporter of the  Reformation movement, and that he issued an injunction in 1541 which  would have authorised such destruction. There was no other material  damage done to the cathedral at this time. In 1566 a parish church,  dedicated to S. Cross, which was situated at the north side of the nave,  was found to be so dilapidated that no attempt was made to render it fit  for service, and the dean and chapter gave to the parishioners the  lady-chapel for a parish church, and it has so remained to this day.    It is probable that the wealth of the monastery had kept the fabric  itself in such a state of complete repair that there was no occasion for  much sustentation work for a long time after the Reformation--at least,  we read nothing of any work being undertaken or of any portions of the  building falling into decay. In the Commonwealth period the cathedral  suffered less than in many places. The stained glass was indeed  destroyed, and the cloisters and some parts of the domestic buildings  pulled down, by order of commissioners. As Oliver Cromwell was Governor  of the Isle of Ely, and often in the city, he was not likely to let the  cathedral services alone. In January, 1644, he interfered during  service, and stopped it, ejecting the congregation, and is said to have  professed that this was an act of kindness, in order to prevent damage  to the building. According to Carlyle,[19] he had written to the  officiating minister, requiring him \"to forbear altogether the choir  service, so unedifying and offensive, lest the soldiers should in any  tumultuary or disorderly way attempt the reformation of the cathedral  church.\" If the people of Ely had heard about the \"reformation\" of the  cathedral church at Peterborough, as carried out by the soldiers of the  Parliament in July of the preceding year, they were certainly well  advised in taking this hint. Bishop Wren--an eager opponent of the  Puritans--was at the time in prison, where he remained until the  Restoration.    The only account we have met with of disrepair in the seventeenth  century says: \"A little part of the end of the North Part fell down  _March_ 28, _Anno_ 1699, but it was soon neatly rebuilt again at the  Charge of the Church, with some Assistance from a Brief.\"[20] This was  the north-west[21] corner of the north transept. The rebuilding was  carried out under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren, nephew of the  bishop.    There is an account of the impression produced upon a visitor to Ely in  the reign of William and Mary, the quaintness of which may perhaps  justify the length of the quotation: \"The Bishop does not care to stay  long in this place, not being good for his health; he is Lord of all the  island, has the command and ye jurisdiction.... There is a good palace  for the Bishop built, but it was unfurnished. There are two Churches.  Ely Minster is a curious pile of building all of stone, the outside full  of Carvings and great arches, and fine pillars in the front, and the  inside has the greatest variety and neatness in the works. There are two  Chappels, most exactly carv'd in stone, all sorts of figures, Cherubims  Gilt, and painted in some parts. Ye Roofe of one Chappell was One Entire  stone most delicately Carv'd and hung down in great poynts all about ye  Church. The pillars are Carv'd and painted with ye history of the bible,  especially the new testament and description of Christ's miracles. The  Lanthorn in ye quire are vastly high and delicately painted, and fine  Carv'd work all of wood. In it ye bells used to be hung (five); the  demention of ye biggest was so much that when they rung them it shooke  ye quire so, and ye Carv'd worke, that it was thought unsafe; therefore  they were taken down. There is one Chappel for Confession, with a Roome  and Chaire of State for ye priest to set to hear ye people on their  knees Confess into his Eare through a hole in ye wall. This Church has  ye most popish remaines of any I have seen. There still remains a Cross  over the alter; the Candlesticks are 3 quarters of a yard high, massy  silver gilt, very heavy. The ffont is One Entire piece of White Marble,  stemm and foote; the Cover was Carv'd Wood, with ye image of Christ's  being baptised by John, and the holy Dove descending on him, all finely  Carv'd white wood, without any paint or varnish.\"[22]    In the eighteenth century some extensive repairs became necessary, and  some alterations in the arrangements of the choir were carried out. The  former chiefly affected the roofs of the octagon and presbytery. Other  parts of the cathedral seem to have needed some repair, but not to a  considerable extent. The latter consisted in the moving of the ritual  choir to the extreme east end of the church, the returned stalls at its  western limit being at the sixth piers from the east end. This  alteration was effected in 1770.    The position of the high altar has been perhaps more often moved in this  cathedral than in any other. In the Norman choir the altar was situated  in the centre of the fourth bay east of the present octagon. When Bishop  Northwold enlarged the presbytery it was moved one bay further east.  After the rebuilding of the three bays west of Northwold's work, it  seems to have been moved again westward, as far as the first piers east  of the octagon. Again in 1770, at the time of which we are now speaking,  it was moved to the extreme east end, and was placed just against the  east wall. Now it stands between the second piers from the east.    It is not a little singular to notice the enthusiasm with which this  eighteenth-century change was greeted. Bentham says[23] it was \"an  alteration which had long been wished for, by all persons of true  taste.\" And again: \"It is allowed by the best judges to be one of the  most useful and ornamental Improvements that could have been effected\";  and he gives a long disquisition highly praising the alteration. The  eastern portion, formerly \"an useless encumbrance,\" was now brought into  use. The organ and voices could be better heard, the view of the octagon  was greatly improved, and the nave and transepts \"have acquired their  due Dimensions.\" Compare this with Hewett's observations less than  eighty years later: \"Never was there a more ill-judged step than the  removal of the Choir hither, towards the latter portion of the last  century. To give it such stinted proportions, and for this purpose to  displace some of the fine old monuments, and to hide others, to obscure  the pillars, and, above all, to erect the miserable organ gallery which  we now behold, may surely be pronounced most tasteless performances\"[24]  When he wrote, the proposal was to replace Walsingham's stalls in the  octagon, and to make Bishop Hotham's three Decorated bays into a  sacrarium, and so presumably re-erect the high altar on the very spot  where it stood in Norman times.    Bishop Mawson contributed L1000 towards the removal of the choir to the  east end. He had also been at the expense of paving the choir with black  and white marble, and of inserting stained glass at the east end. The  work done at this time was under the superintendence of the architect  Essex. An organ-gallery was placed at the entrance of the choir: judging  by the plan given by Bentham,"]]]
