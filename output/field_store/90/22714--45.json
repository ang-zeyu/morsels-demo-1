It seemed a part of what he wanted.    Being thirsty as well as hungry, he pushed through the bushes,--not  noiselessly, as a wild bear moves, but with crashing and tramplings,  as if there were no need of secrecy in the wilds,--and lurched down to  the gravelly brink. Here, as luck would have it, he found a big, dead  sucker lying half-awash, which made him a meal. Then, when sharp  streaks of orange along the eastern horizon were beginning to shed a  mystic colour over the lake, he drew back into the woods and curled  himself up for sleep behind the trunk of a big hemlock.    When the sun was about an hour high he awoke, and made haste to  continue his journey. Along the lake shore he went, to the outlet;  then down the clear, rushing Squatook; and in the afternoon he came  out upon a smaller lake, over which stood sentinel a lofty, beetling  mountain. At the foot of the mountain, almost seeming to duplicate it  in miniature, a steep island of rock rose sharply from the water.    The bear halted on the shore, sniffed wistfully, and looked up at the  lonely mountain. Dim memories, or emotions too dim to be classed as  memories, began to stir in the recesses of his brain. He hurried  around the lake and began to climb the steeps. The lonely mountain was  old Sugar Loaf. The exile had come home.    It was his feet, rather than his head, perhaps, that knew the way so  well. Upward he toiled, through swamps and fir woods, over blueberry  barrens and ranges of granite boulders, till, looking down, he saw the  eagle flying far below him. He saw a vast, empty forest land, beaded  with shining lakes,--and a picture, long covered up in his brain, came  back to him. These were the great spaces that so long ago had  terrified the little cub creeping at his mother's heels. He knew now  where his den was,--just behind that whitish gray rock with the  juniper shrub over it. He ran eagerly to resume possession.    It was now, for the first time, that he found the wilderness less  empty than he had imagined it. Another bear was in possession of the  den,--and in no mood to be disturbed.    He flung himself upon the intruder with a savage roar. The next moment  the two, clutched in a madly clawing embrace, went crashing through a  fringe of bushes and rolled together down a twenty-foot slope of bald  rock. They landed in a crevice full of roots, with a violence that  half-stunned them and threw them apart. As they picked themselves up,  it was plain that the exile had had the best of the tussle. His rich  black fur, to be sure, was somewhat torn and bloody, but he showed no  other signs of battle; while his antagonist breathed heavily and held  one paw clear of the ground.    [Illustration: \"THE EAGLE FLYING FAR BELOW HIM.\"]    The exile was quite fearless, and quite ready to fight for what he  wanted, if necessary. But he was not conscious of any particular  ill-will toward his assailant. What he wanted was possession of that  den. Now, instead of taking advantage of his adversary's partly  disabled condition, he clambered with undignified haste up the steep  rock and plunged into the cave. It was certainly much smaller than he  had imagined it, but it was, nevertheless, much to his taste. He  turned around in it two or three times, as if to adjust it to himself,  then squatted on his haunches in the entrance and looked out  complacently over the airy deeps. The dispossessed bear stood for a  few minutes irresolute, his small eyes red with wrath. For a moment or  two he hesitated, trying to work himself up to the attack. Then  discretion came to his rescue. Grumbling deep in his throat, he turned  and limped away, to seek new quarters on the other side of the  mountain.    Now began for the returned exile two or three months of just such a  life as he had longed for. The keen and tonic winds that blew around  the peak of Sugar Loaf filled his veins with vigour. Through his lack  of education in the lore of the wilderness, his diet was less varied  than it might have been; but this was the fat of the year, and he  fared well enough. When the late berries and fruits were all gone  there were sweet tubers and starchy roots to be grubbed up along the  meadow levels by the water. Instinct, and a spirit of investigation,  soon taught him to find the beetles and grubs that lurked under  stones or in rotting logs,--and in the course of such a search he one  day discovered that ants were good to eat. But the small animals with  which a wild bear is prone to vary his diet were all absent from his  bill of fare. Rabbits, woodchucks, chipmunks, wood-mice, they all kept  out of his sight. His ignorance of the law of silence, the universal  law of the wild, deprived him of many toothsome morsels. As for the  many kinds of fungus which grew upon the mountain, he knew not which  were edible and which poisonous. After an experiment with one  pleasant-smelling red-skinned specimen, which gave him excruciating  cramps, he left the whole race of fungi severely alone.    For perhaps a month he had the solitudes to himself, except for the  big, scornful-looking eagle which always spent a portion of every day  sitting on the top of a blasted pine about a hundred feet above the  den. But, at length, one crisp morning, when he was down by the  lakeside fishing, he found a mate. A young she-bear came out of the  bushes, looked at him, then turned as if to run away,--but didn't. The  exile stopped fishing, and waited civilly to see if the newcomer  wanted to fight. Evidently she had no such desire.    The exile took a few steps up the beach,--which action seemed to  terrify the newcomer almost into flight. Seeing this, he sat down on  his haunches amiably, and waited to see what she would do. What she  did, after much hesitation and delay and half-retreat, was to come up  to his side and sniff trustfully but wonderingly at the great  iron-studded leather collar on his neck. After that the two soon  reached an understanding; and for the next six weeks or so they spent  most of their time together.    Under his mate's instruction, or else by force of her example, the big  bear made some progress in woodcraft, and gained some inklings of the  lesson of silence. He learned, also, to distinguish between the  wholesome and the poisonous fungi. He learned the sweets of a  bee-tree, and how a bear must go to work to attain them. Moving  through the shadows more quietly, he now had glimpses of rabbits and  chipmunks, and even caught sight of a wood-mouse whisking into his  hole under a root. But before he had acquired the cunning to capture  any of these shy kindreds, his mate wandered away, on her own affairs  intent; and he found himself once more alone. Frosts by this time were  binding swale and pool. Ice was forming far out from the edges of the  lake. The first snows had fallen and the great snows were threatening.  And the little she-bear was getting ready to creep into a hole and  curl up for her winter's sleep. She no longer wanted company,--not  even the company of this splendid, black comrade, whose collar had so  filled her with admiration.    When, at length, the winter of the north had fairly settled down upon  the Squatooks, the exile's ribs were well encased in fat. But that  fortunate condition was not to last long. When the giant winds, laden  with snow and Arctic cold, thundered and shrieked about the peak of  Sugar Loaf, and in the loud darkness strange shapes of drift rode down  the blast, he slept snugly enough in the narrow depths of his den. But  the essential winter lore of his kind he had not learned. He had not  learned to sleep away the time of storm and famine. As for instinct,  it failed him altogether in this emergency. During his five years of  life with the circus, he had had no chance to gratify his winter  drowsiness, and gradually the power to hibernate had passed away from  him. The loss was irremediable. By this one deprivation his contact  with man had ruined him for the life of nature.    When man has snatched away from Nature one of her wild children,  Nature, merciless in her resentments, is apt to say, \"Keep him! He is  none of mine!\" And if the alien, his heart aching for his own,  insists upon returning, Nature turns a face of stone against him.    Unskilled in hunting as he was, and unable to sleep, the bear was soon  driven to extremes. At rare intervals he succeeded in capturing a  rabbit. Once or twice, after a fierce frost had followed a wet sleet  storm, he had climbed trees and found dead birds frozen to their  perches. But most of the time he had nothing but starvation rations of  wood-ants and buds. In the course of a few weeks he was lean as a  heron, and his collar hung loose in his fur. He was growing to hate  the icy and glittering desolation,--and, as he had once longed for an  untried freedom, now he longed for the companionship of men.    He was now wandering far afield in his daily quest for food, sometimes  not returning for three or four days at a time. Once, on an excursion  over into the Madawaska Valley, he came upon a deadfall temptingly  baited with pork. He rushed forward ravenously to snatch the  bait,--but just in time that scent called up an ancient memory. The  horror and the shock of that far-off day when such a trap had crushed  his mother's life out, came back upon him. It was not the scene,  exactly, that came back, but rather the memory of an anguish. Obscure  as it was, it had power to master his appetite and drive him to  another foraging-ground. Thenceforth he foraged no more in the  Madawaska Valley.    In such a desolate fashion the exile dragged through the frozen weeks,  till February came in with deeper snows and fiercer frosts. At this  time hunger and loneliness drove him far over to the valley of the  Toledi; and here, one still and biting day, he came upon a human  trail.

FOOTNOTES:    [A] To the uninitiated I may explain that in a horizontal loom the  plane of the warp is more or less parallel with that of the floor,  while in an upright or vertical loom the plane of the warp is at right  angles to that of the floor.    [B] To avoid indistinctness through over reduction, I have endeavoured  to keep all reproductions in this paper as large as possible, and  think I have succeeded in not losing any detail in the necessary  reduction.    [C] Hay's drawings are not published but can be seen in the Brit.  Mus., Add. MSS. No. 29823, Fol. 32.    [D] Olafsson, to be referred to later on, remarks that while in Ovid's  time the _spathe_ was used for beating-in the weft, in Seneca's time  the weft was beaten in by a toothed instrument. In other words a  weaver's comb--the embryo reed--had been introduced.          II. THE GREEK LOOM.      [Illustration: Fig. 28.--A Bushongo weaver at work. From Torday and  Joyce, _Notes Ethnographiques_, _Ann. du Congo_, p. 182.]    We have now to say a few words about an upright loom which differs  very materially from the Egyptian loom already described. Whether the  horizontal loom is a later product than the vertical loom, or was  evolved from it, or whether both were independent inventions cannot be  discussed here, but I may point out that there is an intermediate form  between the two. It is doubtful as to whether this is a transition  form. It was first brought to my notice by Mr. T. A. Joyce, as in use  amongst some negro peoples in Central Africa possessing an old, high  and possibly introduced civilisation, and is figured in Messrs. Torday  and Joyce's Notes _Ethnographiques ... Bakuba ... et Bushongo_  (_Annales du Congo_) pp. 24 and 182. In this loom the warp is  stretched between an upper beam and a lower beam at an angle of about  90 degrees, and the weaver sits underneath at his work, Fig. 28. It is  not at all uncommon to meet with illustrations showing the warp  stretched at an incline, and apart from the fact that in many the  weavers are posing for illustration, and therefore, are most probably  not exactly in their natural positions, the tilted arrangement has  this advantage, namely, that the work of beating-in is improved by  the fall given to the \"sword\" which, with less exertion by the  weaver, drives the weft home more effectively. In all these cases,  however, the weaver sits or stands in front of the loom, but in the  case of the Bushongo the loom is tilted to such an extent that the  weaver finds it more convenient to sit underneath the warp.    The discovery by Messrs. Alan Gardiner and N. de G. Davies of  illustrations of Egyptian upright looms, confirms Wilkinson in his  statement and illustration that the Egyptians had this class of loom  as well as the horizontal one. The vertical loom is found in Europe,  Asia, Africa and America, and is, probably, ethnically as old if not  older than the horizontal loom.[E] But this Egyptian upright loom  differs from another, the Greek, or Central European, or Scandinavian  form of the upright loom, in having an upper and a lower beam so that  the warp is made taut between two beams, while in the Greek loom there  is only _one_ beam. The warp hangs from this beam, the warp threads  being made taut by means of weights attached at the lower ends.    [Illustration: Fig. 29a.--Illustration on a small lekythos of an  Athenian girl at work on a tapestry loom, together with a full size  tracing of the tapestry loom. British Museum. B.C. 500.]    [Illustration: Fig. 29b.--Illustration of a Greek woman with a  tapestry loom. From Stackelberg's _Graeber der Hellenen_, pl. xxxiii.]    The Greeks were, however, acquainted with the tapestry loom, for there  exists in the British Museum a small lekythos with an illustration,  Fig. 29a, of such an article resting on the knees of a lady weaver.[F]    [Illustration: Fig. 30.--Greek woman at work on a loom. From C. Robert  +Eph arch+ 1892, pl. xiii., p. 247. It is not possible to say from  this illustration whether this is a warp weighted loom or not.]    [Illustration: Fig. 31.--Penelope at her loom. Illustration on an  Athenian skyphos found in an Etruscan tomb at Chiusi, and at present  in the museum there. The illustration is taken from _Monumenti d.  Inst. Archeologico_, IX., pl. xlii.]    It has been described by Mr. H. B. Walters in _Jour. Hellenic  Studies_, XXXI., 1911, p. 15, who says: \"In front of her, Fig. 29a, is  a white wool basket (_Kalathos_) and on her lap is a frame somewhat in  the form of a lyre, being formed by two upright pieces with knobs at  the top, diverging slightly towards the top, across between which are  stretched two threads at the top and two at the bottom, seven vertical  threads being also visible. Her hands are placed on the threads, which  she is engaged in manipulating. This object can only be intended for a  hand loom, though there is apparently no evidence for the use of such  objects in ancient times or among Oriental races either in the past or  the present day. The only other parallel to the representation on this  vase is one published by Stackelberg, Fig. 29b, where a woman holds a  similar frame and is similarly occupied with her hands. The writers of  the articles _Sticken_ in Baumeister and _Phrygium Opus_ in Daremberg  and Saglio, misled by the likeness of the object to the modern  crewel-frame, interpret the process as embroidery. But this kind of  work implies cloth or other textile substance already woven, on which  patterns are worked in, whereas in both vase paintings the textile is  obviously in course of construction.\" He is right in so far as he  goes, but both representations are those of _tapestry_ looms which  fact is indicated by the warp threads in both cases, and by the design  marked on the warp threads of Fig. 29b--a method of preparing their  work in use to this day by tapestry weavers. Some authorities consider  that tapestry weaving is more closely related to mat making than to  true weaving. In other words, I take it tapestry is an early stage in  the development of weaving. From this we get some idea as to how far  the Greeks had progressed in the textile arts.    As pointed out by MM. Daremberg and Saglio, _Dic. des Antiquites  Grecques et Romaines_ pt. 46, p. 164, \"illustrations of Greek or Roman  methods of weaving are very rare, they are much reduced and in so far  as the art is concerned purely diagrammatic.\" On the other hand if  there are numerous references in the texts of classic authors, these  references seem rather to obscure than elucidate the method of  working. However, there are three illustrations--the Penelope loom,  Fig. 31, and two Boeotian looms, one of which is illustrated in Fig.  15--quite sufficient to explain the principle of the upright loom as  used with warp weights by the Greeks, and the discovery of numerous  articles, considered to be the warp weights, confirm the illustration.    The principle is the same throughout, viz.: the looms are vertical,  there is a warp beam on top, there are two cross rods one of which is  a laze rod and _possibly_ the other is a heddle; and the warp threads  are all kept taut by means of attached weights. On one of the Boeotian  looms a bobbin or spool is shown. Along the top of Penelope's loom  there are indications of nine pegs, on six of which balls of coloured  thread have been placed, evidently for working out the designs, very  much the same as shown on the rug loom in Bankfield Museum already  referred to. The warp weights on this Athenian illustration are  triangular in shape, and perhaps resemble the pyramidic weights found  in Egypt and attributed to Roman times. Assuming these pyramids are  Roman warp weights it would appear that both Greeks and Romans had  vertical looms on which the warp threads were kept taut by means of  weights. In one of the few clearly expressed technical classical  references, Seneca speaks of the warp threads stretched by hanging  weights.    In the above classical illustrations which are after all only rough  diagrams, the warp weights appear to hang from a _single_ thread only,  but this can not have been correct. The warp threads must have been  bunched, because a single suspended thread with a tension weight  immediately begins to unravel, and so loses the advantage of its  having been spun, as any one can ascertain for oneself. As regards the  same point on the Lake Dwellers looms, Cohausen was the first to  surmise that the warp threads were bunched to receive the weight, and  Messikommer proved it by practical experiment.[G]    As can be surmised with this class of loom the weaving begins at the  _top_, working _down_wards, and the beating-in of the weft is  _up_wards--the exact opposite to the method adopted with other  looms--for the pendant warp ends, although weighted to keep them taut,  do not appear to have been further fixed in position, so that to  commence weaving at the lower end made the operation so extremely  difficult as to be almost impossible.
