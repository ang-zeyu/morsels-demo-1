After all, it was a  pretty queer-looking pumpkin, though. It had to grow hanging down, and  not resting on anything, and after it started with a round head, like  other pumpkins, its neck began to pull out, and pull out, till it looked  like a gourd or a big pear. That's the way it looked in the fall,  hanging from the vine on the fence, when the first light frost came and  killed the vine. It was the day when the farmer was gathering his  pumpkins in the cornfield, and he just happened to remember the seeds he  had planted in the home-patch, and he got out of his wagon to see what  had become of them. He was perfectly astonished to see the size of the  good little pumpkin; you could hardly get it into a bushel basket, and  he gathered it, and sent it to the county fair, and took the first  premium with it.\"    \"How much was the premium?\" asked the boy. He yawned; he had heard all  these facts so often before.    [Illustration: TOOK THE FIRST PREMIUM AT THE COUNTY FAIR.]    \"It was fifty cents; but you see the farmer had to pay two dollars to  get a chance to try for the premium at the fair; and so it was _some_  satisfaction. Anyway, he took the premium, and he tried to sell the  pumpkin, and when he couldn't, he brought it home and told his wife they  must have it for Thanksgiving. The boy had gathered the bad little  pumpkin, and kept it from being fed to the cow, it was so funny-looking;  and the day before Thanksgiving the farmer found it in the barn, and he  said,    \"'Hollo! Here's that little fool pumpkin. Wonder if it thinks it's a  morning-glory yet?'    \"And the boy said, 'Oh, father, mayn't I have it?'    \"And the father said, 'Guess so. What are you going to do with it?'    \"But the boy didn't tell, because he was going to keep it for a  surprise; but as soon as his father went out of the barn, he picked up  the bad little pumpkin by its long neck, and he kind of balanced it  before him, and he said, 'Well, now, I'm going to make a pumpkin-glory  out of _you_!'    [Illustration: \"'HERE'S THAT LITTLE FOOL PUMPKIN,' SAID THE FARMER.\"]    \"And when the bad little pumpkin heard that, all its seeds fairly  rattled in it for joy. The boy took out his knife, and the first thing  the pumpkin knew he was cutting a kind of lid off the top of it; it was  like getting scalped, but the pumpkin didn't mind it, because it was  just the same as war. And when the boy got the top off he poured the  seeds out, and began to scrape the inside as thin as he could without  breaking through. It hurt awfully, and nothing but the hope of being a  pumpkin-glory could have kept the little pumpkin quiet; but it didn't  say a word, even after the boy had made a mouth for it, with two rows of  splendid teeth, and it didn't cry with either of the eyes he made for  it; just winked at him with one of them, and twisted its mouth to one  side, so as to let him know it was in the joke; and the first thing it  did when it got one was to turn up its nose at the good little pumpkin,  which the boy's mother came into the barn to get.\"    \"Show how it looked,\" said the boy.    And the papa twisted his mouth, and winked with one eye, and wrinkled  his nose till the little girl begged him to stop. Then he went on:    \"The boy hid the bad pumpkin behind him till his mother was gone,  because he didn't want her in the secret; and then he slipped into the  house, and put it under his bed. It was pretty lonesome up there in the  boy's room--he slept in the garret, and there was nothing but broken  furniture besides his bed; but all day long it could smell the good  little pumpkin, boiling and boiling for pies; and late at night, after  the boy had gone to sleep, it could smell the hot pies when they came  out of the oven. They smelt splendid, but the bad little pumpkin didn't  envy them a bit; it just said, 'Pooh! What's twenty pumpkin pies to one  pumpkin-glory?'\"    \"It ought to have said 'what _are_,' oughtn't it, papa?\" asked the  little girl.    \"It certainly ought,\" said the papa. \"But if nothing but it's grammar  had been bad, there wouldn't have been much to complain of about it.\"    \"I don't suppose it had ever heard much good grammar from the farmer's  family,\" suggested the boy. \"Farmers always say cowcumbers instead of  cucumbers.\"    \"Oh, _do_ tell us about the Cowcumber, and the Bullcumber, and the  little Calfcumbers, papa!\" the little girl entreated, and she clasped  her hands, to show how anxious she was.    \"What! And leave off at the most exciting part of the pumpkin-glory?\"    The little girl saw what a mistake she had made; the boy just gave her  _one look_, and she cowered down into the papa's lap, and the papa went  on.    \"Well, they had an extra big Thanksgiving at the farmer's that day. Lots  of the relations came from out West; the grandmother, who was living  with the farmer, was getting pretty old, and every year or two she  thought she wasn't going to live very much longer, and she wrote to the  relations in Wisconsin, and everywhere, that if they expected to see her  alive again, they had better come this time, and bring all their  families. She kept doing it till she was about ninety, and then she just  concluded to live along and not mind how old she was. But this was just  before her eighty-ninth birthday, and she had drummed up so many sons  and sons-in-law, and daughters and daughters-in-law, and grandsons and  great-grandsons, and granddaughters and great-granddaughters, that the  house was perfectly packed with them. They had to sleep on the floor, a  good many of them, and you could hardly step for them; the boys slept in  the barn, and they laughed and cut up so the whole night that the  roosters thought it was morning, and kept crowing till they made their  throats sore, and had to wear wet compresses round them every night for  a week afterwards.\"    When the papa said anything like this the children had a right to pound  him, but they were so anxious not to have him stop, that this time they  did not do it. They said, \"Go on, go on!\" and the little girl said, \"And  then the tables!\"    \"Tables? Well, I should think so! They got all the tables there were in  the house, up stairs and down, for dinner Thanksgiving Day, and they  took the grandmother's work-stand and put it at the head, and she sat  down there; only she was so used to knitting by that table that she kept  looking for her knitting-needles all through dinner, and couldn't seem  to remember what it was she was missing. The other end of the table was  the carpenter's bench that they brought in out of the barn, and they put  the youngest and funniest papa at that. The tables stretched from the  kitchen into the dining-room, and clear through that out into the hall,  and across into the parlor. They hadn't table-cloths enough to go the  whole length, and the end of the carpenter's bench, where the funniest  papa sat, was bare, and all through dinner-time he kept making fun. The  vise was right at the corner, and when he got his help of turkey, he  pretended that it was so tough he had to fasten the bone in the vise,  and cut the meat off with his knife like a draw-shave.\"    \"It was the drumstick, I suppose, papa?\" said the boy. \"A turkey's  drumstick is all full of little wooden splinters, anyway.\"    \"And what did the mamma say?\" asked the little girl.    [Illustration: \"CAUGHT HIS TROUSERS ON A SHINGLE-NAIL, AND STUCK.\"]    \"Oh, she kept saying, 'Now you behave!' and, 'Well, I should think you'd  be ashamed!' but the funniest papa didn't mind her a bit; and everybody  laughed till they could hardly stand it. All this time the boys were out  in the barn, waiting for the second table, and playing round. The  farmer's boy went up to his room over the wood-shed, and got in at the  garret window, and brought out the pumpkin-glory. Only he began to  slip when he was coming down the roof, and he'd have slipped clear off  if he hadn't caught his trousers on a shingle-nail, and stuck. It made a  pretty bad tear, but the other boys pinned it up so that it wouldn't  show, and the pumpkin-glory wasn't hurt a bit. They all said that it was  about the best jack-o'-lantern they almost ever saw, on account of the  long neck there was to it; and they made a plan to stick the end of the  neck into the top of the pump, and have fun hearing what the folks would  say when they came out after dark and saw it all lit up; and then they  noticed the pigpen at the corner of the barn, and began to plague the  pig, and so many of them got up on the pen that they broke the middle  board off; and they didn't like to nail it on again because it was  Thanksgiving Day, and you mustn't hammer or anything; so they just stuck  it up in its place with a piece of wood against it, and the boy said he  would fix it in the morning.    \"The grown folks stayed so long at the table that it was nearly dark  when the boys got to it, and they would have been almost starved if the  farm-boy hadn't brought out apples and doughnuts every little while. As  it was, they were pretty hungry, and they began on the pumpkin pie at  once, so as to keep eating till the mother and the other mothers that  were helping could get some of the things out of the oven that they had  been keeping hot for the boys. The pie was so nice that they kept eating  at it all along, and the mother told them about the good little pumpkin  that it was made of, and how the good little pumpkin had never had any  wish from the time it was nothing but a seed, except to grow up and be  made into pies and eaten at Thanksgiving; and they must all try to be  good, too, and grow up and do likewise.

On the  side opposite was a blacksmith's forge.    \"That's where you're goin' to work!\" he said, grimly, pointing to the  forge.          CHAPTER IX.    KIT MAKES A NEW ACQUAINTANCE.      Grafton, where Barlow's circus was billed to appear on Saturday, was  only six miles farther on. Oakford was about half way, so that in  accompanying the blacksmith to his home, Kit had accomplished about half  the necessary journey. Now that he had undeceived the blacksmith as to  his intention of staying he felt at ease in his mind. It was his plan to  remain over night in the house and pursue his journey early the next  day.    \"Are these all the clo'es you brought with you?\" asked Bickford,  surveying Kit's neat and rather expensive suit with disapproval.    \"Yes. Am I not well enough dressed for a blacksmith?\" asked Kit, with a  smile.    \"You're a plaguy sight too well dressed,\" returned Bickford. \"You want a  good rough suit, for the forge is a dirty place.\"    \"I thought I told you I did not intend to work for you, Mr. Bickford.\"    \"That's what you said, but I don't take no stock in it. Your uncle has  bound you out to me, and that settles it.\"    \"If he has bound me out, where are the papers, Mr. Bickford?\" asked Kit,  keenly.    This question was a poser. The blacksmith supposed that Kit might be  ignorant that papers were required, but he found himself mistaken.    \"There ain't no papers, but that don't make no difference,\" he said. \"He  says you're to work for me, and I'm goin' to hold you to it.\"    Kit did not reply, for he saw no advantage in discussion.    \"You'll get a dollar a week and your board, and you can't do better. I  reckon dinner is about ready now.\"    Kit felt ready for the dinner, for the morning's ride had sharpened his  appetite. So when, five minutes later, he was summoned to the table, he  willingly accepted the invitation.    \"This is my new 'prentice, Mrs. Bickford,\" said the blacksmith, by way  of introduction, to a spare, red headed woman, who was bustling about  the kitchen, where the table was spread.    Mrs. Bickford eyed Kit critically.    \"He's one of the kid glove kind, by his looks,\" she said. \"You don't  expect to get much work out of him, do you?\"    \"I reckon I will, or know the reason why,\" responded Bickford,  significantly.    \"Set right down and I'll dish up the victuals,\" said Mrs. Bickford. \"We  don't stand on no ceremony here. What's your name, young man?\"    \"People call me Kit.\"    \"Sounds like a young cat. It's rediculous to give a boy such a name.  First thing you know I'll be calling you Kitty.\"    \"I hope I don't look like a cat,\" said Kit laughing.    \"You ain't got no fur on your cheeks yet,\" said the blacksmith, laughing  heartily at his own witticism. \"What have you got for dinner, mother?\"    \"It's a sort of picked-up dinner,\" answered Mrs. Bickford. \"There's some  pork and beans warmed up, some slapjacks from breakfast, and some fried  sassidges.\"    \"Why, that's a dinner for a king,\" said the blacksmith, rubbing his  hands.    He took his seat, and put on a plate for Kit specimens of the delicacies  mentioned above. In spite of his appetite Kit partook sparingly,  supplementing his meal with bread, which, being from the baker's shop,  was of good quality. He congratulated himself that he was not to board  permanently at Mr. Bickford's table.    When dinner was over, the blacksmith in a genial mood said to Kit: \"You  needn't begin to work till to-morrow. You can tramp round the village if  you want to.\"    Kit was glad of the delay, as early the next morning he expected to bid  farewell to Oakford, and thus would avoid a conflict.    He had been in Oakford before, and knew his way about. He went out of  the yard and walked about in a leisurely way. It was early in June, and  the country was at its best. The birds were singing, the fields were  green with verdure, and Kit's spirits rose. He felt that it would be  delightful to travel about the country, as he would do if he joined  Barlow's Circus.    He overtook a boy somewhat larger than himself, a stout, strong country  boy, attired in a rough, coarse working suit. He was about to pass him,  when the country boy called out, \"Hallo, you!\"    \"Were you speaking to me?\" asked Kit, turning and looking back.    \"Yes. Didn't I see you riding into town with Aaron Bickford?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Are you going to work for him?\"    \"That is what he expects,\" answered Kit diplomatically. He hesitated  about confiding his plans to a stranger.    \"Then I pity you.\"    \"Why?\"    \"I used to work for him.\"    \"Did you?\"    \"Yes, I stood it as long as I could.\"    \"Then you didn't like it?\"    \"I guess not.\"    \"What was the trouble?\"    \"Everything. He's a stingy old hunks, to begin with. I went to work for  a dollar a week and board. If the board had been decent, it would have  been something, but I'd as soon board at the poorhouse.\"    \"I have taken dinner there,\" said Kit, smiling.    \"Did you like it?\"    \"I have dined better. In fact I have seldom dined worse.\"    \"What did the old woman give you?\"    Kit enumerated the articles composing the bill of fare.    \"That's better than usual,\" said the new acquaintance.    \"I suppose the dollar a week is all right,\" said Kit.    \"Good enough if you can get it. It's about as easy to get blood out of a  stone, as money out of old Bickford. Generally I had to wait ten days  after the time before I could get the money.\"    \"How is the work?\"    \"Hard, and plenty of it. It's work early and work late, and if there  isn't work at the forge, you've got to help the old woman, by drawing  water and doing chores. You don't live in Oakford, do you?\"    \"No; I came from Smyrna.\"    \"I thought not. Bickford can't get a boy to work for him here. What made  you come? Couldn't you get a place at home?\"    \"I didn't try.\"    \"Well, you haven't done much in coming here.\"    \"I begin to think so,\" Kit responded, with a smile.    \"Hasn't the circus been in your town?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I wanted to go, but I guess I'll manage to see it in Grafton. It shows  there to-morrow.\"    \"Are you going?\" asked Kit with interest.    \"Yes; I shall walk. I'll start early and spend the day there.\"    \"We may meet there.\"    \"You don't expect to go, do you? Bickford won't let you off.\"    Kit smiled.    \"I don't think Mr. Bickford will have much to say about it,\" he said.    \"Are you going to hook jack?\" asked his new acquaintance.    \"I didn't mean to tell you, but I will. I have made up my mind not to  work for Mr. Bickford at all.\"    \"Then why did you come here?\"    \"Because my uncle saw fit to arrange with him.\"    \"What are you going to do, then?\"    \"I am offered work with the circus.\"    \"You are!\" exclaimed the country boy, opening wide his eyes in  astonishment. \"What are you going to do?\"    \"I'm going to be an acrobat.\"    \"What's that?\"    Kit explained as well as he could.    \"What are they going to pay you?\"    \"Ten dollars a week and my expenses,\" answered Kit, proudly.    \"Jehu!\" ejaculated the other boy. \"Why, that's good wages for a man. Do  you think they'd hire me, too?\"    \"If you think you can do what they require, you can ask them.\"    \"Why can't I do it as well as you?\"    \"Because I have been practicing for a long time at a gymnasium. What is  your name?\"    \"Bill Morris.\"    \"Then, Bill, don't say a word to any one about my plans. Suppose we go  to Grafton together?\"    \"All right!\"    Before the boys parted they made an agreement to meet at five o'clock  the next morning, to set out on their walk to Grafton.          CHAPTER X.    KIT'S FIRST NIGHT AT THE BLACKSMITH'S.      At nine o'clock the blacksmith, giving a deep yawn, said: \"You'd better  be getting to bed, young feller. You'll have to be up bright and airly  in the morning.\"    Kit was already feeling sleepy, and made no objection. Though it was yet  early, he had found it hard work to get through the evening, as he could  find nothing to read except a weekly paper, three months old, and a copy  of \"Pilgrim's Progress.\" In truth, neither Mr. Bickford nor his wife  were of a literary turn, and did not even manage to keep up with the  news of the day.    \"I am ready,\" said Kit.    \"Mother, show him to his room,\" added the blacksmith. \"To-morrow I'll  give him a lesson at the forge.\"    \"Perhaps you will,\" said Kit to himself, \"but I think it doubtful.\"    Kit's room was a small back one on the second floor. The front apartment  was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Bickford, and there was one of the same  size which was used as a spare chamber.    Kit's room was supplied with a cot bed, and was furnished in the  plainest manner. One thing he missed. He saw no washstand.    \"Where am I to wash in the morning?\" he asked.    \"You can wash in the tin basin in the kitchen,\" answered Mrs. Bickford.  \"There's a bar of soap down there and a roller towel, so I guess you  won't have to go dirty.\"    Kit shuddered at the suggestion. He had seen bars of yellow soap in the  grocery at home, and didn't think he should enjoy its use. Nor did he  fancy using the same towel with the blacksmith and his wife. He had seen  the roller towel hanging beside the sink, and judged from its appearance  that it had already been used nearly a week.    \"I have been accustomed to wash in my own room,\" he ventured to say.    \"You've been used to a great many things that you won't find here,\"  replied Mrs. Bickford, grimly.    Kit thought it extremely likely.    \"If you can't do as the rest of us do, you can get along without  washing,\" continued the lady.    \"I will try and manage,\" answered Kit, bearing in mind that he expected  to leave the Bickford mansion forever the next morning.    \"That new boy of yours is kind of uppish,\" remarked Mrs. Bickford, when  she returned to the sitting room.    \"What's the matter now?\""]]]
