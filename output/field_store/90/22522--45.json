[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21078"],[0,"The Tale of Miss Kitty Cat (#7)"],[1,"the woman upstairs in any way, Miss  Kitty lost no time in providing a hearty meal for herself.    Then she lay down on an old sack and slept for a while.    And just before the roosters began to crow she had found a broken pane  in a cellar window.    \"What luck!\" said Miss Kitty under her breath. And very silently she  slipped through the opening and stole away.          XX    A LONG JOURNEY      BY SUNRISE Miss Kitty Cat had trotted at least a mile along the road  that passed the peddler's house. She wanted to get a safe distance away  before the family got up and turned loose the dog that had barked the  night before, when she arrived.    Miss Kitty remembered clearly that the wagon had been climbing a long  hill before it turned into the peddler's dooryard. So without hesitating  she started _down_ the road. She knew that in that direction lay  Pleasant Valley--and her home at Farmer Green's.    Having put the first mile of her journey behind her, Miss Kitty stopped  beside a little brook and drank her fill of cool, sweet water. She was  very thirsty, because she hadn't had a drink since the evening before.    A pretty wood stretched beyond the brook, tempting Miss Kitty Cat to  explore it. At that hour of the morning there were many birds twittering  among the trees. And spry chipmunks were frisking about in search of  their breakfast. Miss Kitty Cat just naturally began to think of her own  breakfast.    \"If I were at home, Mrs. Green would be setting a saucer of milk on the  woodshed steps about this time,\" she murmured. \"But now I must shift for  myself.\"    Luckily Miss Kitty was quite able to find something to eat, as a  surprised meadow mouse soon discovered.    After breakfasting, Miss Kitty lingered a while to tease the birds, who  scolded her shrilly, calling her a tramp and telling her to get out of  their woods.    Of course Miss Kitty had to stay there for a time after that, to let the  birds know that they couldn't frighten her away. She scared them almost  out of their wits by threatening to climb up where their nests were. But  she didn't do more than sharpen her claws against a tree-trunk. That  alone was enough to throw them into a panic.    At last, after she had bothered the birds quite enough, Miss Kitty Cat  set off for Pleasant Valley once more. Sometimes she travelled through  fields; sometimes she jogged along the roads; sometimes she jumped to  the top of a stone wall and used that for a highway. And always when she  heard the creak and rattle of a wagon, as the sun rose higher and  higher, she crept into the bushes and hid until she had the road to  herself again.    If Miss Kitty hadn't been homesick she would have thought her adventure  a great lark. But somehow she couldn't get Mrs. Green's house out of her  mind. Especially the thought of the kitchen, with its delicious odors of  seven-layer cakes baking in the oven, and doughnuts frying on top of the  range, made Miss Kitty's nose twitch. And her own particular warm spot  under the range, where she basked away long hours! When she recalled  that it was no wonder that her pace quickened.    Perhaps Miss Kitty Cat herself couldn't have told exactly how she knew  the way back to Farmer Green's place. No doubt she wouldn't have told,  had she known; for she was one of the kind that keep such things to  themselves. She never even explained to old dog Spot, afterward, where  she spent the three nights that she was away from the farm.    Anyhow, Miss Kitty Cat kept plodding along. And one afternoon when she  came out of a patch of woods on a hill-top, she saw something looming  right ahead of her that looked familiar.    It was Blue Mountain. And she knew that on the other side of it lay  Pleasant Valley--and her home at Farmer Green's.          XXI    IN THE PANTRY      OF COURSE everybody knows that while the cat's away the mice will play.  So what happened during Miss Kitty Cat's absence from the farmhouse was  really no more than any one might have expected. There were gay banquets  in Mrs. Green's pantry at midnight. And among those present there was no  one that had a better time than fat Mr. Moses Mouse. He was always the  life of the party. He made jokes about Miss Snooper--as he called Miss  Kitty Cat. And nobody laughed at them harder than he.    With every night that passed, Moses Mouse grew still merrier. Some of  his companions even claimed that they could scarcely eat, he made them  giggle so violently.    On the fourth night of Miss Kitty's absence, and at the fourth banquet,  Mr. Mouse balanced a bit of cheese on the end of his nose, exclaiming at  the same time, \"What a pity it is that Miss Snooper isn't here! How I'd  like to offer her this delicious tidbit!\"    To his great surprise, none of his friends laughed.    \"Look out, Moses!\" Mrs. Mouse cried the next moment.    \"Don't worry, my dear!\" said he. \"I shan't lose this nice piece of  cheese. If I drop it I can find it again. But I'm not going to drop it.  I've practiced this trick a good many times.... It's too bad Miss  Snooper isn't here to see it.\"    [Illustration: Miss Kitty Cat Sees Moses Mouse Balance a Bit of Cheese  on His Nose.]    Still nobody even snickered--though Moses himself would have had he not  been afraid of joggling the cheese off the end of his nose. He thought  the silence very strange. And removing his eyes from the cheese, which  he had been watching closely (though it made him look cross-eyed), he  took a quick glance about him. Everybody had vanished.    \"Ha!\" said Moses Mouse to himself. \"They're playing a trick on me. They're  hiding.\" And he promptly lost his temper. Much as he loved to cut  capers and play tricks on others, Moses never liked to have any one get  a laugh on him. And now he gave a sort of snort, because he was angry.    Thereupon the bit of cheese fell off Moses's nose and rolled behind him  on the pantry floor. He turned to get it, only to find himself face to  face with Miss Snooper herself; for Miss Kitty Cat was home again.    Before Moses Mouse could jump she clapped a paw down on him. And there  he was--a prisoner!    \"Well, well!\" cried Miss Kitty Cat. \"Aren't you glad to see me? You were  just wishing I was here.\"    Moses Mouse didn't act glad--not the least bit! He struggled his hardest  to get away. But Miss Kitty hadn't the slightest trouble holding him,  with only one paw, too.    \"Now that I'm here,\" she said to him, \"don't you want to balance that  scrap of cheese on your nose once more, and offer it to me?\"    Since Miss Kitty caught him, Moses Mouse hadn't said anything that she  could understand. He had made only a few squeaks of fright. Now,  however, he managed to gasp, \"Yes! Just let me go a moment! I can't  pick up the cheese while you're crushing me against the pantry floor.\"          XXII    THE FLOUR BARREL      MISS KITTY CAT took her paw off Moses Mouse, after giving him a sharp  nip to warn him not to try to run away.    \"Ouch!\" Moses squeaked. And then, when he felt himself free, he picked  up the hit of cheese that he had dropped upon the pantry floor. But he  was shaking with fear.    He shook so hard that he couldn't balance the cheese on the end of his  nose. It tumbled off at once and he turned quickly to get it. Miss Kitty  Cat turned with him. And while she was turning, Moses Mouse turned back  again and jumped behind a flour barrel.    She sprang after him. But the barrel stood so near the wall that there  was only a small space behind it. It was wide enough for Moses Mouse to  slip through; but it was entirely too narrow for Miss Kitty Cat. And  Moses Mouse waited just beyond reach of her paw.    She ran around the barrel, only to find that Moses had crawled back  through the opening and was watching her with his beady little eyes.    Miss Kitty Cat was almost frantic. She hurried around the barrel again,  and saw that Moses Mouse had repeated his trick. He needed only to move  the length of his tail, while she had to whisk all the way around the  fat flour barrel.    \"This will never do,\" Miss Kitty thought, as she peered through the  crack at Moses Mouse, while she paused to get her breath. And as she  stared at him, an idea popped into her head. It seemed such a good idea  that Miss Kitty Cat decided to act upon it at once.    So she wheeled and started off again, as if to run around the barrel  once more. But when she had whisked half way around it she turned and  hurried back again.    She had expected to surprise Mr. Moses Mouse on the wrong side of the  crack. And to her astonishment, he wasn't there. He wasn't anywhere in  sight.    \"Goodness me!\" Miss Kitty Cat wailed. \"There must have been something  wrong with my idea.\"    There wasn't. It had merely happened that Moses Mouse had had an idea of  his own.    \"I don't want to stay dodging here the rest of the night,\" he had said  to himself. \"The next time Miss Snooper makes a trip around the barrel  I'm going to run up the side of it and trust to luck.\"    That was exactly what he did. Once on top of the barrel, Moses Mouse  leaped to a shelf. He crept along the shelf until he came to the pantry  window. Now, Mrs. Green had left the window slightly open. And Moses  Mouse darted out of doors and half jumped, half tumbled, to the ground.  He knew how he could get to his nest quickly enough, through a certain  chink in the cellar wall.    Miss Kitty Cat soon decided that she had lost Moses Mouse again.    \"Dear me!\" she sighed. \"What wretched luck I'm having to-night! I  declare, it's a sad home-coming for me.\"    Meanwhile Mr. Moses Mouse was having a most merry time. Mrs. Mouse made  a great fuss over him. And that was exactly what he liked.          XXIII    A SECRET      MISS KITTY CAT was behaving in the strangest manner. She came into the  kitchen and hovered about the feet of Farmer Green's wife, mewing and  looking up at Mrs. Green as if she had something special to tell her.    \"What is it, Kitty?\" Mrs. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21081"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XLIII., No. 25, December 18, 1880 (#7)"],[1,"to  the swiftness of its projectile, can outrun ironclad ships.           *       *       *       *       *          RECENT INVENTIONS.      Mr. Francis M. Osborn, of Port Chester, N. Y., has patented a covering  for a horse that protects him from the weather and from chafing. The  blanket has a band, also stays and straps, the use of which does away  with the surcingle and affords a most efficient protection for the  horse, and may be easily worn under harness in wet weather or at other  times, when desirable.    A novel device, designed especially for containing boxes of cigars and  protecting and displaying their contents, has been patented by Mr.  Robert B. Dando, of Alta, Iowa. The invention consists of a case  containing shelves, on which are fixed the covered cigar or other boxes,  cords connecting the box lids and case doors, so that the opening of the  case doors causes the box lids to open.    An improved bottle stopper has been patented by Mr. Andrew Walker, of  Cincinnati, O. The invention consists in combining with the stopper caps  connected by an intermediate spring.    Mr. James B. Law, of Darlington Court House, S. C., has patented an  improved construction of buckle for fastening the ends of cotton and  other bale bands; it consists in a buckle having a permanent seat for  one end of the bale band, a central opening, into which the other end of  the band is entered through an oblique channel, and a bar offsetting  from the plane of the buckle, notched or recessed to prevent lateral  movement of the band, and connecting the free ends of the buckle on each  side of the oblique channel to strengthen the buckle.    An improved buckboard wagon has been patented by Mr. William Sanford, of  Cohoes, N. Y. The invention consists in combining with the buckboards  curved longitudinal springs placed beneath the buckboards, and curved  cross springs connected at their ends with the buckboards by cap plates  so as to increase the strength and elasticity of the wagon.    An improved vehicle wheel has been patented by Messrs. George W. Dudley  and William J. Jones, of Waynesborough, Va. The main object of this  invention is to form a wheel hub for vehicles in such manner that the  wheel will yield sufficiently when undue and sudden strains or jars may  come upon it to receive the force of the blow and shield the other  portions of the vehicle from the destructive effects of such action, as  well as to afford ease and comfort of motion to the occupant; and the  improvement consists in securing the inner ends of the spokes to rim  plates, to form a fixed and solid connection therewith, the rim plates  being loosely secured to the butt flanges and box of the hub, so that it  is free to move in a vertical plane, but prevented from moving laterally  and limited in its vertical movement by an elastic packing interposed  between the inner ends of the spokes and the hub box.    Mr. Francis G. Powers, of Moweaqua, Ill., has patented an improvement in  the class of atmospheric clothes pounders, that is to say, pounders  which are constructed with one or more chambers or cavities in which the  air is alternately compressed and allowed to expand at each  reciprocation.    An improved means for connecting the body of a baby carriage to the  running gear has been patented by Mr. Charles M. Hubbard, of Columbus,  Ohio. It consists in supporting the rear end by one or more coil  springs, and hinging the front portion of the body to a pair of upturned  supports rising from the front axle.    An improved ferrule for awl handles has been patented by Mr. Jules  Steinmeyer, of St. Louis, Mo. The object of this invention is to prevent  splitting of the handle, to secure both the ferrule and leather pad  firmly in place, and to furnish a durable and serviceable awl handle.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW TELEGRAPH INSULATOR.      The insulator represented in the annexed engraving was originally  designed to meet the requirements of South American telegraph service,  but it is equally well adapted to lines in other places. The main idea  is to avoid breakage from expansion and contraction in a climate subject  to sudden changes of temperature, and to avoid the mischief occasioned  by a well known South American bird, the \"hornero,\" by building nests of  mud on the brackets and insulators. With this insulator these nests  cannot cause a weather contact or earth; on the contrary, the nest  rather improves the insulation. The sectional view, Fig 2, shows the  construction of the insulator and the manner of fastening it to the  cross arm or bracket. A rubber ring is placed between the upper end of  the porcelain insulator and the cross arm, and another similar ring is  placed between the head of the suspending screw and the bottom of the  insulator. It will be noticed that with this construction the insulator  cannot be broken by the contraction of the screw or by the swelling of  the cross-piece. This insulator can be used on an iron bracket and in  connection with either iron or wooden posts, and is in every way more  secure than the insulators in common use. The first cost of these  insulators compares favorably with the cheapest in market, while it is  less liable to breakage, lasts longer, and gives better results. It has  been patented in this country and in Europe.    [Illustration: IMPROVED TELEGRAPH INSULATOR.]    Further information maybe obtained by addressing Mr. J. H. Bloomfield,  Concordia, Entre Reos, Argentine Republic, South America.           *       *       *       *       *          BUSINESS COLLEGES.    PACKARD'S BUSINESS COLLEGE.      [Illustration: THE FIRST DEPARTMENT]    [Illustration: SECOND DEPARTMENT]    [Illustration: THIRD DEPARTMENT]    [Illustration: FOURTH OR FINISHING DEPARTMENT]    [Illustration: THE BUDGET ROOM]    [Illustration: THE ASSEMBLY ROOM]    There are two very general prejudices against the class of schools known  as business colleges. One is that their chief aim--next to lining the  pockets of their proprietors--is to turn out candidates for petty  clerkships, when the country is already overrun with young men whose  main ambition is to stand at a desk and \"keep books.\" The other is that  the practical outcome of these institutions is a swarm of conceited  flourishers with the pen, who, because they have copied a set or two of  model account books and learned to imitate more or less cleverly certain  illegibly artistic writing copies, imagine themselves competent for any  business post, and worthy of a much higher salary than any merely  practical accountant who has never been to a business college or  attempted the art of fancy penmanship as exhibited in spread eagles and  impossible swans.    As a rule popular prejudices are not wholly unfounded in reason; and we  should not feel disposed to make an exception in this case. When the  demand arose for a more practical schooling than the old fashioned  schools afforded, no end of writing masters, utterly ignorant of actual  business life and methods, hastened to set up ill managed writing  schools which they dubbed \"business colleges,\" and by dint of  advertising succeeded in calling in a multitude of aspirants for  clerkships. In view of the speedy discomfiture of the deluded graduates  of such schools when brought face to face with actual business affairs,  and the disgust of their employers who had engaged them on the strength  of their alleged business training, one is not so much surprised that  prejudice against business colleges still prevails in many quarters, as  that the relatively few genuine institutions should have been able to  gain any creditable footing at all.    The single fact that they have overcome the opprobrium cast upon their  name by quacks, so far as to maintain themselves in useful prosperity,  winning a permanent and honorable place among the progressive  educational institutions of the day, is proof enough that they have a  mission to fulfill and are fulfilling it. This, however, is not simply,  as many suppose, in training young men and young women to be skilled  accountants--a calling of no mean scope and importance in itself--but  more particularly in furnishing young people, destined for all sorts of  callings, with that practical knowledge of business affairs which every  man or woman of means has constant need of in every-day life. Thus the  true business college performs a twofold function. As a technical school  it trains its students for a specific occupation, that of the  accountant; at the same time it supplements the education not only of  the intending merchant, but equally of the mechanic, the man of leisure,  the manufacturer, the farmer, the professional man--in short, of any one  who expects to mix with or play any considerable part in the affairs of  men. The mechanic who aspires to be the master of a successful shop of  his own, or foreman or manager in the factory of another, will have  constant need of the business habits and the knowledge of business  methods and operations which a properly conducted business school will  give him. The same is true of the manufacturer, whose complicated, and  it may be extensive, business relations with the producers and dealers  who supply him with raw material, with the workmen who convert such  material into finished wares, with the merchants or agents who market  the products of his factory, all require his oversight and direction.  Indeed, whoever aspires to something better than a hand-to-mouth  struggle with poverty, whether as mechanic, farmer, professional man, or  what not, must of necessity be to some degree a business man; and in  every position in life business training and a practical knowledge of  financial affairs are potent factors in securing success.    How different, for example, would have been the history of our great  inventors had they all possessed that knowledge of business affairs  which would have"]]]
