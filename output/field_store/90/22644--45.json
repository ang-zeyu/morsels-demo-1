They that receive not this, failing in faith    To grasp the greater wisdom, reach not Me,    Destroyer of thy foes! They sink anew    Into the realm of Flesh, where all things change!      By Me the whole vast Universe of things    Is spread abroad;--by Me, the Unmanifest!    In Me are all existences contained;    Not I in them!      Yet they are not contained,    Those visible things! Receive and strive to embrace    The mystery majestical! My Being--    Creating all, sustaining all--still dwells    Outside of all!      See! as the shoreless airs    Move in the measureless space, but are not space,    [And space were space without the moving airs];    So all things are in Me, but are not I.      At closing of each Kalpa, Indian Prince!    All things which be back to My Being come:    At the beginning of each Kalpa, all    Issue new-born from Me.      By Energy    And help of Prakriti my outer Self,    Again, and yet again, I make go forth    The realms of visible things--without their will--    All of them--by the power of Prakriti.      Yet these great makings, Prince! involve Me not    Enchain Me not! I sit apart from them,    Other, and Higher, and Free; nowise attached!      Thus doth the stuff of worlds, moulded by Me,    Bring forth all that which is, moving or still,    Living or lifeless! Thus the worlds go on!      The minds untaught mistake Me, veiled in form;--    Naught see they of My secret Presence, nought    Of My hid Nature, ruling all which lives.    Vain hopes pursuing, vain deeds doing; fed    On vainest knowledge, senselessly they seek    An evil way, the way of brutes and fiends.    But My Mahatmas, those of noble soul    Who tread the path celestial, worship Me    With hearts unwandering,--knowing Me the Source,    Th' Eternal Source, of Life. Unendingly    They glorify Me; seek Me; keep their vows    Of reverence and love, with changeless faith    Adoring Me. Yea, and those too adore,    Who, offering sacrifice of wakened hearts,    Have sense of one pervading Spirit's stress,    One Force in every place, though manifold!    I am the Sacrifice! I am the Prayer!    I am the Funeral-Cake set for the dead!    I am the healing herb! I am the ghee,    The Mantra, and the flame, and that which burns!    I am-of all this boundless Universe-    The Father, Mother, Ancestor, and Guard!    The end of Learning! That which purifies    In lustral water! I am OM! I am    Rig-Veda, Sama-Veda, Yajur-Ved;    The Way, the Fosterer, the Lord, the Judge,    The Witness; the Abode, the Refuge-House,    The Friend, the Fountain and the Sea of Life    Which sends, and swallows up; Treasure of Worlds    And Treasure-Chamber! Seed and Seed-Sower,    Whence endless harvests spring! Sun's heat is mine;    Heaven's rain is mine to grant or to withhold;    Death am I, and Immortal Life I am,    Arjuna! SAT and ASAT, Visible Life,    And Life Invisible!      Yea! those who learn      The threefold Veds, who drink the Soma-wine,    Purge sins, pay sacrifice--from Me they earn      Passage to Swarga; where the meats divine      Of great gods feed them in high Indra's heaven.      Yet they, when that prodigious joy is o'er,    Paradise spent, and wage for merits given,      Come to the world of death and change once more.      They had their recompense! they stored their treasure,      Following the threefold Scripture and its writ;    Who seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure      Of joy which comes and goes! I grant them it!      But to those blessed ones who worship Me,    Turning not otherwhere, with minds set fast,    I bring assurance of full bliss beyond.      Nay, and of hearts which follow other gods    In simple faith, their prayers arise to me,    O Kunti's Son! though they pray wrongfully;    For I am the Receiver and the Lord    Of every sacrifice, which these know not    Rightfully; so they fall to earth again!    Who follow gods go to their gods; who vow    Their souls to Pitris go to Pitris; minds    To evil Bhuts given o'er sink to the Bhuts;    And whoso loveth Me cometh to Me.    Whoso shall offer Me in faith and love    A leaf, a flower, a fruit, water poured forth,    That offering I accept, lovingly made    With pious will. Whate'er thou doest, Prince!    Eating or sacrificing, giving gifts,    Praying or fasting, let it all be done    For Me, as Mine. So shalt thou free thyself    From Karmabandh, the chain which holdeth men    To good and evil issue, so shalt come    Safe unto Me-when thou art quit of flesh--    By faith and abdication joined to Me!      I am alike for all! I know not hate,    I know not favour! What is made is Mine!    But them that worship Me with love, I love;    They are in Me, and I in them!      Nay, Prince!    If one of evil life turn in his thought    Straightly to Me, count him amidst the good;    He hath the high way chosen; he shall grow    Righteous ere long; he shall attain that peace    Which changes not. Thou Prince of India!    Be certain none can perish, trusting Me!    O Pritha's Son! whoso will turn to Me,    Though they be born from the very womb of Sin,    Woman or man; sprung of the Vaisya caste    Or lowly disregarded Sudra,--all    Plant foot upon the highest path; how then    The holy Brahmans and My Royal Saints?    Ah! ye who into this ill world are come--    Fleeting and false--set your faith fast on Me!    Fix heart and thought on Me! Adore Me! Bring    Offerings to Me! Make Me prostrations! Make    Me your supremest joy! and, undivided,    Unto My rest your spirits shall be guided.      HERE ENDS CHAPTER IX. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled \"Rajavidyarajaguhyayog,\"    Or \"The Book of Religion by the Kingly Knowledge and the Kingly    Mystery.\"            CHAPTER X        Krishna.[FN#l6]    Hear farther yet, thou Long-Armed Lord! these latest words I say--    Uttered to bring thee bliss and peace, who lovest Me alway--    Not the great company of gods nor kingly Rishis know    My Nature, Who have made the gods and Rishis long ago;    He only knoweth-only he is free of sin, and wise,    Who seeth Me, Lord of the Worlds, with faith-enlightened eyes,    Unborn, undying, unbegun. Whatever Natures be    To mortal men distributed, those natures spring from Me!    Intellect, skill, enlightenment, endurance, self-control,    Truthfulness, equability, and grief or joy of soul,    And birth and death, and fearfulness, and fearlessness, and shame,    And honour, and sweet harmlessness,[FN#17] and peace which is the    same    Whate'er befalls, and mirth, and tears, and piety, and thrift,    And wish to give, and will to help,--all cometh of My gift!    The Seven Chief Saints, the Elders Four, the Lordly Manus set--    Sharing My work--to rule the worlds, these too did I beget;    And Rishis, Pitris, Manus, all, by one thought of My mind;    Thence did arise, to fill this world, the races of mankind;    Wherefrom who comprehends My Reign of mystic Majesty--    That truth of truths--is thenceforth linked in faultless faith to Me:    Yea! knowing Me the source of all, by Me all creatures wrought,    The wise in spirit cleave to Me, into My Being brought;    Hearts fixed on Me; breaths breathed to Me; praising Me, each to each,    So have they happiness and peace, with pious thought and speech;    And unto these--thus serving well, thus loving ceaselessly--    I give a mind of perfect mood, whereby they draw to Me;    And, all for love of them, within their darkened souls I dwell,    And, with bright rays of wisdom's lamp, their ignorance dispel.      Arjuna.    Yes! Thou art Parabrahm! The High Abode!    The Great Purification! Thou art God    Eternal, All-creating, Holy, First,    Without beginning! Lord of Lords and Gods!    Declared by all the Saints--by Narada,    Vyasa Asita, and Devalas;    And here Thyself declaring unto me!    What Thou hast said now know I to be truth,    O Kesava! that neither gods nor men    Nor demons comprehend Thy mystery    Made manifest, Divinest! Thou Thyself    Thyself alone dost know, Maker Supreme!    Master of all the living! Lord of Gods!    King of the Universe! To Thee alone    Belongs to tell the heavenly excellence    Of those perfections wherewith Thou dost fill    These worlds of Thine; Pervading, Immanent!    How shall I learn, Supremest Mystery!    To know Thee, though I muse continually?    Under what form of Thine unnumbered forms    Mayst Thou be grasped? Ah! yet again recount,    Clear and complete, Thy great appearances,    The secrets of Thy Majesty and Might,    Thou High Delight of Men! Never enough    Can mine ears drink the Amrit[FN#18] of such words!      Krishna.    Hanta! So be it! Kuru Prince! I will to thee unfold    Some portions of My Majesty, whose powers are manifold!    I am the Spirit seated deep in every creature's heart;    From Me they come; by Me they live; at My word they depart!    Vishnu of the Adityas I am, those Lords of Light;    Maritchi of the Maruts, the Kings of Storm and Blight;    By day I gleam, the golden Sun of burning cloudless Noon;    By Night, amid the asterisms I glide, the dappled Moon!

Thus, if small shows seldom bring forth a world-beating dog, they at  least are full of clever and humanized exhibits and of men and women to  whom the success or failure of their canine friends is a matter of  intensest personal moment. Wherefore the small show often gives the  beholder something he can find but rarely in a larger exhibition.    A few dogs genuinely enjoy shows--or are supposed to. To many others a  dogshow is a horror.    Which windy digression brings us back by prosy degrees to Bruce and to  the Hampton dogshow.    The collies were the first breed to be judged. And the puppy class, as  usual, was the first to be called to the ring.    There were but three collie pups, all males. One was a rangy tri-color  of eleven months, with a fair head and a bad coat. The second was an  exquisite six-months puppy, rich of coat, prematurely perfect of head,  and cowhocked. These two and Bruce formed the puppy class which paraded  before Symonds in the oblong ring.    \"Anyhow,\" whispered the Mistress as the Master led his stolidly  gigantic entry toward the enclosure, \"Bruce can't get worse than a  third-prize yellow ribbon. We ought to be a little proud of that. There  are only three entries in his class.\"    But even that bit of barren pride was denied the awkward youngster's  sponsor. As the three pups entered the enclosure, the judge's half-shut  eyes rested on Bruce--at first idly, then in real amazement. Crossing  to the Master, before giving the signal for the first maneuvers, he  said in tired disgust--    \"Please take your measly St. Bernard monstrosity out of the ring. This  is a class for collies, not for freaks. I refuse to judge that pup as a  collie.\"    \"He's a thoroughbred,\" crossly protested the Master. \"I have his  certified pedigree. There's no better blood in--\"    \"I don't care what his ancestors were,\" snapped the judge. \"He's a  throw-back to the dinosaur or the Great Auk. And I won't judge him as a  collie. Take him out of the ring. You're delaying the others.\"    A judge's decision is final. Red with angry shame and suppressing an  unworthy desire to kick the luckless Bruce, the Master led the pup back  to his allotted bench. Bruce trotted cheerily along with a maddening  air of having done something to be proud of. Deaf to the Mistress's  sympathy and to her timidly voiced protests, the Master scrawled on an  envelope-back the words \"For Sale. Name Your Own Price,\" and pinned it  on the edge of the bench.    \"Here endeth the first lesson in collie-raising, so far as The Place is  concerned,\" he decreed, stalking back to the ringside to watch the rest  of the judging.    The Mistress lingered behind, to bestow a furtive consolatory pat upon  the disqualified Bruce. Then she joined her husband beside the ring.    It was probably by accident that her skirt brushed sharply against the  bench-edge as she went--knocking the \"For Sale\" sign down into the  litter of straw below.    But a well-meaning fellow-exhibitor, across the aisle, saw the bit of  paper flutter floorward. This good soul rescued it from the straw and  pinned it back in place.    (The world is full of helpful folk. That is perhaps one reason why the  Millennium's date is still so indefinite.)    An hour later, a man touched the Master on the arm.    \"That dog of yours, on Bench 48,\" began the stranger, \"the big pup with  the 'For Sale' sign on his bench. What do you want for him?\"    The Mistress was several feet away, talking to the superintendent of  the show. Guiltily, yet gratefully, the Master led the would-be  purchaser back to the benches, without attracting his wife's notice.    A few minutes afterward he returned to where she and the superintendent  were chatting.    \"Well,\" said the Master, trying to steel himself against his wife's  possible disappointment, \"I found a buyer for Bruce--a Dr. Halding,  from New York. He likes the pup. Says Bruce looks as if he was strong  and had lots of endurance. I wonder if he wants him for a sledge-dog.  He paid me fifteen dollars for him; and it was a mighty good bargain. I  was lucky to get more than a nickel for such a cur.\"    The Master shot forth this speech in almost a single rapid breath.  Then, before his wife could reply,--and without daring to look into her  troubled eyes,--he discovered an acquaintance on the far side of the  ring and bustled off to speak to him. The Master, you see, was a  husband, not a hero.    The Mistress turned a worried gaze on the superintendent.    \"It was best, I suppose,\" she said bravely. \"We agreed he must be sold,  if the judge decided he was not any good. But I'm sorry. For I'm fond  of him. I'm sorry he is going to live in New York, too. A big city is  no place for a big dog. I hope this Dr. Halding will be nice to the  poor puppy.\"    \"Dr.--WHO?\" sharply queried the superintendent, who had not caught the  name when the Master had spoken it in his rapid-fire speech. \"Dr.  Halding? Of New York? Huh!    \"You needn't worry about the effect of city life on your dog,\" he went  on with venomous bitterness. \"The pup won't have a very long spell of  it. If I had my way, that man Halding would be barred from every  dog-show and stuck in jail. It's an old trick of his, to buy up  thoroughbreds, cheap, at shows. The bigger and the stronger they are,  the more he pays for them. He seems to think pedigreed dogs are better  for his filthy purposes than street curs. They have a higher nervous  organism, I suppose. The swine!\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked the Mistress, puzzled by his vehemence. \"I  don't--\"    \"You must have heard of Halding and his so-called 'research work,'\" the  superintendent went on. \"He is one of the most notorious  vivisectionists in--\"    The superintendent got no further. He was talking to empty air. The  Mistress had fled. Her determined small figure made a tumbled wake  through the crowd as she sped toward Bruce's bench. The puppy was no  longer there. In another second the Mistress was at the door of the  building.    A line of parked cars was stretched across the opposite side of the  village street. Into one of these cars a large and loose-jointed man  was lifting a large and loose-jointed dog. The dog did not like his  treatment, and was struggling pathetically in vain awkwardness to get  free.    \"Bruce!\" called the Mistress, fiercely, as she dashed across the street.    The puppy heard the familiar voice and howled for release. Dr. Halding  struck him roughly over the head and scrambled into the machine with  him, reaching with his one disengaged hand for the self-starter button.  Before he could touch it, the Mistress was on the running-board of the  car.    As she ran, she had opened her wristbag. Now, flinging on the  runabout's seat a ten and a five-dollar bill, she demanded--    \"Give me my dog! There is the money you paid for him!\"    \"He isn't for sale,\" grinned the Doctor. \"Stand clear, please. I'm  starting.\"    \"You're doing nothing of the sort,\" was the hot reply. \"You'll give  back my dog! Do you understand?\"    For answer Halding reached again toward his self-starter. A renewed  struggle from the whimpering puppy frustrated his aim and forced him to  devote both hands to the subduing of Bruce. The dog was making frantic  writhings to get to the Mistress. She caught his furry ruff and raged  on, sick with anger.    \"I know who you are and what you want this poor frightened puppy for.  You shan't have him! There seems to be no law to prevent human devils  from strapping helpless dogs to a table and torturing them to death in  the unholy name of science. But if there isn't a corner waiting for  them, below, it's only because Hades can't be made hot enough to punish  such men as they ought to be punished! You're not going to torture  Bruce. There's your money. Let go of him.\"    \"You talk like all silly, sloppy sentimentalists!\" scoffed the Doctor,  his slight German accent becoming more noticeable as he continued: \"A  woman can't have the intellect to understand our services to humanity.  We--\"    \"Neither have half the real doctors!\" she flashed. \"Fully half of them  deny that vivisection ever helped humanity. And half the remainder say  they are in doubt. They can't point to a single definite case where it  has been of use. Alienists say it's a distinct form of mental  perversion,--the craving to torture dumb animals to death and to make  scientific notes of their sufferings.\"    \"Pah!\" he sniffed. \"I--\"    She hurried on    \"If humanity can't be helped without cutting live dogs and kittens to  shreds, in slow agony--then so much the worse for humanity! If you  vivisectors would be content to practice on one another--or on  condemned murderers,--instead of on friendly and innocent dogs, there'd  be no complaint from any one. But leave our pets alone. Let go of my  puppy!\"    By way of response the Doctor grunted in lofty contempt. At the same  time he tucked the wriggling dog under his right arm, holding him thus  momentarily safe, and pressed the self-starter button.    There was a subdued whir. A move of Halding's foot and a release of the  brake, and the car started forward.    \"Stand clear!\" he ordered. \"I'm going.\"    The jolt of the sudden start was too much for the Mistress's balance on  the running-board. Back she toppled. Only by luck did she land on her  feet instead of her head, upon the greasy pavement of the street.    But she sprang forward again, with a little cry of indignant dismay,  and reached desperately into the moving car for Bruce, calling him  eagerly by name.    Dr. Halding was steering with his left hand, while his viselike right  arm still encircled the protesting collie. As the Mistress ran  alongside and grasped frantically for her doomed pet, he let go of  Bruce for an instant, to fend off her hand--or perhaps to thrust her  away from the peril of the fast-moving mud-guards. At the Mistress's  cry--and at the"]]]
