Carefully, at  the Master's feet, he laid the rusty pistol.    Then, stepping back a pace, he looked up, eagerly, into the dumfounded  man's face, tail waving, dark eyes aglint with expectation. It had been  hard to locate the weapon, in all that tangle of lilac-stems. It had  been harder to carry the awkwardly heavy thing all the way back, in his  mouth, without dropping it. But, if this was the plaything the Master  had chosen, Lad was only too willing to continue the game.    A little choking sound made the collie shift his gaze suddenly to the  Mistress's troubled face. And the light of fun in his eyes was  quenched. The sight of her splendid dog retrieving so joyously the  weapon designed for his death, was almost too much for the Mistress's  self-control.    The effect on the Master was different.    As Wefers made as though to jump forward and grab the pistol, the  Master said sharply:    \"WATCH it, Laddie!\"    Instantly, Lad was on the alert. The game, it seemed, had begun again,  and along sterner lines. He was to guard this plaything;--particularly  from the bearded intruder who was snatching so avidly for it.    There was a sharp growl, a flash of fierce white teeth, a bound. One of  Lad's snowy little forepaws was on the fallen pistol. And the rest of  Lad's sinewy body was crouching above it, fangs aglint, eyes blazing  with hot menace.    Wefers jerked back his protruding arm, with extreme quickness; barely  avoiding a deep slash from the collie's shearing eye-teeth. And Lad,  continued to \"watch\" the pistol.    The dog was having a lovely time. Seldom had he been happier. All good  collies respond in semi-psychic fashion to the moods of their masters.  And, to Lad, the very atmosphere about him was thrilling just now to  waves of stark excitement. With the delightful vanity which is a part  of the collie make-up, he realized that in some manner he himself was a  prominent part of this excitement. And he reveled in it.    As Wefers pulled back his imperiled arm, the Mistress stepped forward,  before the Master could speak or move.    \"Even if it were true that he could get rabies by a bite from a rabid  dog,\" said she, \"and even if that dog, yesterday, were mad, that  wouldn't affect Laddie. For he didn't bite Laddie. He never got the  chance. Lad pinned him to the ground. And while the mongrel was  struggling to get up, you shot him. One of your bullets flicked Lad's  foreleg. But the mongrel's teeth never came within twelve inches of  him. I can testify to that.\"    \"He was fighting with a mad dog!\" reiterated Wefers, fumingly. \"I saw  'em, myself. And when a dog is fighting, he's bound to get bit. I'm not  here to argue over it. I'm here to enforce the law of the sov'r'n State  of Noo Jersey, County of P'saic, Township of--\"    \"But the law declares a prisoner innocent, till he's proved guilty,\"  urged the Mistress, restraining the Master, by a light hand on his  restless arm. \"And Lad's not been proved guilty. It isn't proved he was  bitten, at all. I can testify he wasn't. My husband washed the scratch  and he can tell you it wasn't made by a bite. Any veterinary can tell  you the same thing, at a glance. We can establish the fact that Lad was  not bitten. So even if the law lets you shoot a bitten dog,--which I  don't believe it does,--it doesn't empower you to shoot Lad. Why!\" she  went on, shuddering slightly, \"if Lad hadn't sprung between that brute  and myself, you'd probably be wanting to shoot ME! For I'd have been  bitten, terribly, if Lad hadn't--\"    \"I'm not here to listen to silly nonsense!\" announced Wefer, glaring at  the watchful dog and back at the man and woman, \"I came here in p'soot  of my sworn dooty. I been balked and resisted by the two of you; and my  pistol's been stole from me and a savage dog's been pract'c'lly sicked  onto me. I'm an of'cer of the law. And I'm going to have the law on  both of you, for int'fering with me like you have. And I'm going to get  a court order to shoot--\"    \"Then you haven't a court order or any other authority to shoot him?\"  the Master caught him up. \"You admit that! You came over here, thinking  you could bluff us into letting you do it, just because you happen to  wear a tin badge! I thought so. Now, my pink-whiskered friend, you'll  stop shouting and making faces; and you'll listen to me, a minute. You  aren't the first officer who has exceeded his authority on the chance  that people will think he's acting within his rights. This time the  bluff fails. With no warrant or summons or other legal power to back  him, a constable has no more right on my place than any negro  trespasser. What you may or may not be able to persuade some magistrate  to do about this, I don't know. But, for the present, you'll clear out.  Get that? I've warned you, in the presence of a witness. If you know  anything of law, you know that a landowner, after such warning, may  eject a trespasser by force. Go. And keep going. That's all.\"    Wefers sputtered wordlessly, from time to time, during the tirade. But  before its end, he fell silent and began to fidget. He himself was none  too well versed in the matter of his legal rights of intrusion. And,  for the moment, he had no chance to execute his errand. Later, armed  with a magistrate's order, he could pay back with interest his  humiliation of this morning. In the meantime--    \"Gimme my gun!\" he demanded in grouchy surrender.    The Master stooped; picked up the pistol, and held it in both hands.  Lad, all eagerness, stood dancingly waiting for him to throw it again.  But it was not thrown. Instead, the Master \"broke\" the weapon; shaking  the greasy cartridges out on to his own palm and then transferring them  to his pockets.    \"In case of accidents,\" he explained, pleasantly, as he handed the  pistol back to its scowling owner. \"And if you'll stop at the  post-office, this afternoon, you'll find these shells in an envelope in  your letter-box. Now, chase; unless you want Lad to escort you to your  boat. Lad is fine at escorting undesirables off the Place. Want to see  him perform?\"    But Wefers did not answer. Snatching the impotent pistol and shoving it  back into his coattail pocket, he strode lakeward, muttering lurid  threats as he went.    The Mistress watched his lank figure on its way down the lawn to the  dock.    \"It's-it's AWFUL!\" she faltered, clutching at her husband's arm. \"Oh,  you don't suppose he can--can really get leave to shoot Laddie, do you?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered the Master, as uneasy as she. \"A mad-dog scare  has a way of throwing everybody into a fool panic. There's no knowing  what some magistrate may let him do. But one thing is mighty certain,\"  he reassured her. \"If the whole National Guard of New Jersey comes  here, with a truckload of shooting-warrants, they aren't going to get  Laddie. I promise you that. I don't quite know how we are going to  prevent it. But we're going to. That's a pledge. So you're not to  worry.\"    As they talked they continued to watch the constable in his clumping  exit from the Place. Wefers reached the dock, and stamped out to its  extreme end, where was moored the livery scow he had commandeered for  his journey across the lake from the village.    A light wind was blowing. It had caught the scow's wide stern and had  swung it out from the dock. Wefers unhooked the chain and dropped it  clankingly into the bottom. Then, with ponderous uncertainty, he  stepped from the dock's string-piece to the prow of his boat.    A whiff of breeze slapped the loosened scow, broadside on, and sent it  drifting an inch or two away. As a result, Homer Wefers' large  shoe-sole was planted on the edge of the prow, instead of its center.  His sole was slippery from the dew of the lawn. The prow's edge was  still more slippery, from having been the scene of a recent  fish-cleaning.    The constable's gangling body strove in vain to hold any semblance of  balance. His foot slid out from its precarious perch, pushing the boat  farther into the lake. And the dignified officer flapped wildly in  mid-air.    Not being built on a lighter-than-air principle, he failed to hold this  undignified aerial pose for more than the tenth of a second. At the end  of that time he plunged splashingly into the lake, at a depth of  something like eight feet of water.    \"Good!\" applauded the Master, as the Mistress gasped aloud in not  wholly sorrowful surprise and as Lad ambled gayly down the lawn for a  closer view of this highly diverting sight. \"Good! I hope he ruins  every stitch he has on; and then gets rheumatism and tonsilitis. He--\"    The Master's babbling jaw fell slack; and the pleased grin faded from  his face.    Wefers had come to the surface, after his ducking. He was fully three  yards beyond the dock and as far from his drifting scow. And he was  doing all manner of sensational things with his lanky arms and legs and  body. In brief, he was doing everything except swim.    It was this phenomenon which had wiped away the Master's grin of pure  happiness.    Any man may fall into the water, and may present a most ludicrous  spectacle in doing so. But, on the instant he comes to the surface, his  very first motions will show whether or not he is a swimmer. It had not  occurred to the Master that anyone reared in the North Jersey  lake-country should not have at least enough knowledge of swimming to  carry him a few yards. But, even as many sailors cannot swim a stroke,  so many an inlander, born and brought up within sight of fresh water,  has never taken the trouble to grasp the simplest rudiments of  natation. And such a man, very evidently, was Homer Wefers, Township  Head Constable.    His howl of crass panic was not needed to prove this to the Master. His  every wild antic showed it.

The man smiled as he took down and handed the gigantic thong.    \"Mind what you are doing, sir,\" he said.  \"A waggon whip is rather an  awkward thing, until you are used to it; but when you are you know it is  a nice, neat, handy little tool.  You see, it's a two-handed weapon.\"    \"That's plain enough,\" said Dean, laughing.  \"Let's have a try after  you, Mark.\"    \"Yes,\" said his cousin, giving the whip a wave round, its heavy lash  whistling through the air.    \"Here, stop!\" cried Sir James angrily.  \"What do you think you are  doing?  Salmon fishing?  It's a good thing, doctor, that there's no hook  at the end.\"    \"Oh, I'm very sorry, father,\" said the boy, colouring.    \"Very sorry, indeed!  Why, you nearly cut my ear off.  Here, doctor, we  had better go.\"    \"No, no, don't go, father.  I won't try any more;\" and Mark hastily  handed the great whip back to the driver.    \"Here, but I want to try,\" said Dean.    \"Well, you are not going to try now,\" said his uncle, half irritably.  \"You will have plenty of chances, both of you, when you have got a field  to yourselves.  You will be scaring the bullocks.\"    \"All right, sir,\" said the big fellow, replacing the whip by the great  tilted waggon.  \"I'll teach you how to handle it when we get out on the  veldt.  Like me to show you, perhaps, now?\"    \"No, no,\" said Sir James; \"not while we are here.\"    \"It's quite safe, sir,\" said the man good-humouredly.  \"I could give a  flip to any one of the bullocks you like to point out without the thong  coming near anybody.\"    \"Oh, let him, please, father.\"    \"Very well,\" said Sir James, rather grumpily.  \"Shall we stand farther  off?\"    \"Oh, no, sir,\" replied the man.    \"Let's pick out that one with the white nose,\" whispered Dean.  \"I don't  believe he can hit it;\" and he pointed to one fat beast that was  standing almost alone blinking its eyes and ruminating over its cud.    \"Yes; hit that one,\" said Mark.    The man seemed to give the long whip an easy wave in the air, and the  point of the lash alighted on the bullock's smooth neck, making the  animal start and toss its head; and then in response to a command which  sounded like _Barrk_, it slowly sidled close up to the nearest of its  fellows, and then went on chewing the cud again.    \"Ay, ay, Jacob!\" shouted the driver, and he uttered a few words in a  patois that was probably a composition of Dutch and Hottentot, which  made the little yellow flat-nosed driver come shambling up, grinning, to  take the big whip pitched to him and go off to a distance of some  five-and-twenty yards, where, after uttering a few incomprehensible  cries which had the effect of making such of the bullocks as were  crouching in the sand rise slowly to their feet and sidle up together,  the strange looking driver gave the whip a wave or two where he stood,  and began to crack it, at every _whish_ producing what sounded like a  series of rifle shots, watching the English driver the while until he  was told to desist.    \"Bravo!\" cried Mark, and Dean clapped his hands.    \"I say, can you crack a whip like that?\" cried Dean.    \"Oh, yes, sir.  Teach you too, if you like.\"    \"Well, I do like,\" said the boy; \"but when uncle isn't here.\"    When the interiors of the two great tilted waggons that were close at  hand had been examined with some curiosity, as they were to be  storehouses and dwelling-places combined, the little party went off in  another direction, Mark eagerly enquiring what was to be their  destination now.    \"Oh, I was going to show you the little cobs the doctor has bought--  ponies, I suppose I ought to call them.\"    \"What, has he got them already?\" cried Mark.    \"Oh, yes; it has been very short work,\" said the doctor.  \"The officer  who has charge of the little garrison here introduced me to a dealer,  and I think we have been very fortunate to meet a gentleman who was well  acquainted with the ways of the settlers here, for he has given me some  very good hints, and in addition promised to have a guide found who was  hanging about the camp and is now waiting here after being up the  country with a hunting party who left for Beira about a fortnight ago.  He is one of the Illakas, Sir James,\" continued the doctor, \"and it  seems that he has been expelled from his tribe for being friendly to the  English.\"    \"Quite a savage, then,\" said Sir James.    \"Oh, yes; I suppose he is a pure-blooded black, and knows the country  well.  Let me see, we must turn down in this direction, I think.  Yes--  pass that corrugated iron shed-like house--to be sure, that's it--and  there's the man the ponies belong to.\"    He nodded in the direction of a little keen-looking man who appeared  rather mushroom-like, thanks to the well-worn, broad-leafed felt hat he  wore.  He was leaning over a rough enclosure in which four ponies were  browsing, and keenly watching the approaching party as he smoked.    As soon as he realised that they were coming in his direction he took  his pipe from his mouth, tapped the ashes out upon a post, took off his  hat and stuck the short pipe in the band.    \"Come to have a look at the ponies, gentlemen?\" he said.    \"Yes,\" said Sir James; \"I want my son and nephew to have a look at them  and try them.\"    \"I see,\" said the man, scanning the boys attentively.  \"My man isn't  here.  Like them saddled and bridled?\"    Sir James looked at the two boys, as the man continued, \"Can the young  gentlemen ride?\"    He glanced at the doctor as he spoke.    \"Yes,\" said the latter quietly; \"after our fashion in England.  Well  broken horses.  But they can't ride wild beasts.\"    \"Well, no, captain; nobody expects that; but I shall have to keep you  waiting a bit while I have my man found, and send him to borrow a saddle  and bridle.  I have only got two, and one of the officers from up at the  barracks and his friend have got them for the day.  I have plenty of  halters, and I can clap a rug on one of the ponies.  What do you say to  that, young gentlemen?\"    \"I'd rather have one without the rug,\" said Mark, \"if they are quiet.\"    \"Quiet as lambs, sir, as long as you don't play any larks with them.\"    \"Oh, we shan't play any tricks,\" said Mark.    \"That's right, sir.  Out here we like to treat a pony well.  They are  scarce, and worth their money.  I am afraid, sir,\" continued the man,  turning to the doctor, \"that I did not charge enough for them.\"    \"But you don't want to draw back from your bargain?\" said the doctor  sternly.  \"I paid you the price you asked.\"    \"Yes, sir.  The captain up yonder brought you to me as English friends,  and him and his officers are good customers to me.  No, I am not going  to ask more.  Only I will go as far as this: if you bring them back to  me sound and in a fair condition I will take them again at the price.  Here, one of you,\" he shouted to a group of idlers who had sauntered up  to the fence of the enclosure, \"go to the house and ask the missis to  give you a couple of halters and a horse rug.  My chap, Browne, has gone  to meet the officers.\"    One of the men sauntered off quietly, leaving the party of strangers to  walk across the kraal, the boys keenly examining the little browsing  animals.    \"Well, doctor,\" said Sir James, \"I must say I admire your choice.  They  are beautiful little creatures, and I hope that they have no vice.\"    \"Vice!  Not they, sir,\" said their late owner, as the ponies upon being  approached lifted their heads to stare at the visitors for a few moments  and then go on browsing at the low-growing bushes that formed their  feed.  \"This don't look like vice, does it, sir?\" said the man,  thrusting his hand into his pocket and drawing it out full of maize.    One of the ponies raised its head, stretched out its neck in the  direction of the extended hand, and trotted up.    \"These mealies are rather a hard bite for them, sir, but this lot are  very fond of a taste, and I let them have one now and then; but of  course you will always have a few sacks handy.--Now, young gentlemen,  try this one,\" and he poured some of the golden grain into Mark's hand.  \"You too, sir,\" he continued, and he brought out some more to trickle  into Dean's.    There was no doubt so far in the tameness of the two ponies, which fed  quietly enough from the boys' hands and submitted to being handled,  patted and held by their thick forelocks or manes.    By this time the dealer's messenger had returned with a couple of  halters.    \"Missis can't find a horse rug,\" said the man surlily.    \"Never mind; we can do without, I daresay.  But just be on the lookout,  and if you see my Browne send him to me.  Now then, gentlemen, like to  try barebacked?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mark; and as soon as a halter had been thrown over one of  the ponies' heads the dealer handed the end to him.    \"Oh, come,\" he said, \"not the first time you have been on a pony;\" for  Mark held up one leg, which the man took in his hand and gave him a  hoist; and the boy making a spring at the same time dropped on the  pony's glossy back, but like vaulting ambition overleaped himself and  rolled over on the other side, startling the pony into making off.  But  the dealer made a snatch at the halter, just in time, and it stopped  short, snorting.    \"Hurt, my boy?\" cried Sir James, anxiously.    \"No, father; only vexed,\" said the boy, dusting the sand from his  flannels.  \"Now then,\" he continued, to the dealer, \"you hoisted me too  hard.\"    \"Going to have another try?\"    \"Why, of course,\" cried the boy"]]]
