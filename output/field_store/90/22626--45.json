If you keep the moths in a bottle they will lay  their small circular flat eggs where they can be seen by looking  closely. During the winter examine under the bark of apple trees and in  cracks and crevices about apple pens for the small silk cocoons  containing the worms. Examine in the same places in the spring about  apple blooming time and then in place of the small pink worms you will  find the small brown pupae. Keep these a few days and the moths will  appear.    What proportion of apples in your region are wormy? What are they used  for? Are the trees sprayed just after the blossoms fall to control the  pest? Where spraying is carefully done, are there as many wormy apples?  Why not spray all the orchards properly and have no worms?    Draw and describe the different stages of the apple worm or codling moth  and its injury to fruit.           *       *       *       *       *        \"_O, yet we trust that somehow good        Will be the final goal of ill,      To pangs of nature, sins of will,        Defects of doubt and taints of blood;_        \"_That nothing walks with aimless feet;        That not one life shall be destroyed,      Or cast as rubbish to the void,        When God hath made the pile complete;_        \"_That not a worm is cloven in vain,        That not a moth with vain desire,      Is shrivelled in a fruitless fire,        Or but subserves another's gain._\"                                            --TENNYSON.          CHAPTER VIII    THE TOMATO OR TOBACCO WORM      [Illustration: Egg of Tomato worm moth enlarged.]    This insect is often very destructive to tomatoes and tobacco. Most  country boys and girls know it and fear its ugly looking horn. When full  grown it is four inches long, usually dark green with a number of  slanting white lines along either side. It is so near the color of the  plants that it is difficult to see it.    [Illustration: Young tomato worm.]    During the summer months the worms are common, being most abundant in  August. In the fall the mature worms go into the ground and change from  the worm to a large, oval, brown pupa with a jug-handle-like appendage  on the under side. These are often turned up when the garden is plowed  in the spring. After tomato plants are well started the large greyish  humming-bird-like moths comes from the ground and begin laying eggs. The  moth expands from four to six inches and is often seen at dusk visiting  the blossoms of \"jimson weed\" and other large tube flowers. They are  also found around lights at night.    Where they are troublesome the plants should either be sprayed with a  poison when the injury is first noticed or else the worms should be  picked off and destroyed. There is a small parasitic wasp which is very  helpful in destroying this caterpillar. They live inside the worm and  when mature bore out through the skin on the sides and back where they  spin small white egg-like cocoons from which later the small wasps  emerge. Often a hundred or more may come out of one worm.      STUDY AND OBSERVATION    Observe the worms where they are at work on tomatoes. Disturb them and  hear them grind their jaws together. Do they eat the foliage rapidly?  Dust a little Paris green on the foliage where a worm is eating and see  what happens in half an hour. Collect a number of the worms in a glass  fruit can and give them tomato leaves to eat and watch them grow. How  many segments are there to the body? How many of the segments have  small black spots on either side? These are holes through which the worm  breathes. Is the horn at the end of the body stiff enough to stick into  your hand? This is thought to be a sting but it is only an ornament and  is entirely harmless. When full grown they will burrow into the sand in  the jar and change to the pupa.    [Illustration: Full-fed tomato worm slightly reduced.]    [Illustration: Chrysalis or pupa of tomato worm. Note the  jug-handle-like sheaths enclosing the proboscis.]    Examine the brown pupa carefully and see if it can move. What is the  peculiar structure on the under side of the body? The moth which comes  from this in the spring is very large. It is covered with white and  black scales and hairs which give it a mottled appearance. Examine on  the under side of the head for a peculiar structure like a watch spring.  This is the sucking tube used in drawing up nectar from deep tubular  blossoms. When the moths are sipping nectar from \"jimson weed\" blossoms  they can be killed by pouring a little poison down into the blossoms.    [Illustration: Tomato worm moth natural size.]          CHAPTER IX    THE FIREFLY      This insect is of little economic importance to us at present but its  peculiar habit of producing light makes it a very striking form and one  which deserves study. The firefly is a beetle, and begins to make its  appearance the latter part of June when the darkest nights may be one  solid glow of fire. They live largely in damp places and bottoms at  night are specked with their tiny flashes of light. The larval or grub  stage is passed on the ground beneath grass, weeds and rubbish where  they often prey upon other insects. In some cases the grubs may be able  to produce light though as a rule the luminous grub-like creature or  glow-worm is a wingless adult firefly.      OBSERVATIONS AND STUDIES    Watch for the first appearance of the fireflies in the evening and see  where they come from. Do they all appear at once or only a few at first?  Do they fly fast? How often is the light produced? Will they produce the  light while on the ground? When they fly do they stay near the ground or  high in the air? Do they light in trees?    [Illustration: Firefly beetles on sour-dock leaf.]    Catch one of the fireflies in your hat and examine it carefully. How  large is it? Describe briefly its size, shape and color. Are its wing  covers hard like other beetles? Where is the light produced? What color  is the light? Is it bright? Hold the firefly on the opposite side of a  sheet of paper and see if the light will show through. Try the same with  your hat, coat sleeve and other objects. This light is extremely  penetrating and unlike the light of a lamp is produced with the  generation of very little heat. Will it continue to flash while you hold  it? Are the segments from which the light comes the same color as the  other segments of the body? Crush the tip of the body between your  thumb and finger and see if the light continues to appear. How long does  it last? Collect a number of the fireflies and put them in a bottle and  see if the light is strong enough to enable you to read.    The firefly has proven to us that our methods of producing light are  extremely wasteful since much of the energy is lost in heat and it is  possible that through the lesson of the firefly we may some day be able  to produce better light at less expense.    [Illustration: Lower surface of firefly beetle enlarged to show the  light producing segments of the abdomen.]          CHAPTER X    THE WHITE GRUB OR JUNE-BUG      [Illustration: White grub feeding on roots of corn plant, enlarged.]    This insect is more familiar to country children in the grub stage.  Every one who has followed a plow in rich sod land has seen these fat,  white coiled grubs roll down into the furrow when the plow turns them  up. They are in the ground feeding on the roots of plants. Often all the  roots of grass in lawns and meadows are eaten off and the sod dies and  can be rolled up like strips of carpet. This insect breeds largely in  sod and when this is plowed under and other crops are planted the grubs  may injure them severely. Corn, wheat, oats and truck crops are  severely injured. In some cases the grubs may feed for three years  before they change to the pupa and later to the adult beetle. To control  this pest, plow in the fall and rotate crops, so that sod will not  remain on the same land too long.    [Illustration: June beetle showing stages of development. The larva or  grub worm is feeding on roots under ground; the pupa and adult are shown  above ground.]    The beetles come from the ground or may be plowed out in May and June  and are commonly spoken of as May-beetles or June-bugs. They are usually  of a yellowish-brown color and are often troublesome coming into the  house at night where they buzz about the light, bumping into everything  until they finally drop heavily to the floor. All country boys and girls  know these beetles.      OBSERVATIONS AND STUDIES    Collect a number of the grubs from the ground and examine them for legs,  eyes and mouth. How many legs have they? Can you find eyes? What use  would they have for eyes while in the ground? Do they bite? Place them  on the table and see how they move. What color are they? Do you find  spines or hair on their bodies? Pull up a little grass by the roots and  put it in a jelly tumbler with soil and put some of the grubs in with  it. Water it so as to keep it growing and follow the development of the  grubs.    Collect some of the beetles and put them in a bottle and watch them  crawl about. Where are their wings? How can they get them out when they  want to fly? How many legs have they? Examine the tip of the feet for  hooks. What are these used for? Can they chew leaves? Where are their  eyes? Do you find feelers and if so where?    Write a short description of the grub and the beetle and make careful  drawings of them.          CHAPTER XI    THE COLORADO POTATO BEETLE      This is one of the worst pests of the potato. As the name would imply it  came originally from Colorado but is common now all over the country.  The full grown insect is short and thick with a hard shell, striped with  yellow and black. The grubs, on the other hand, are soft and red or  orange with black spots. Both the grubs and the beetles feed on potatoes  and often completely strip them of their leaves.

In his trunk were found the invaluable Bruce-Partington plans,  which he had put up for auction in all the naval centres of Europe.    Colonel Walter died in prison towards the end of the second year of his  sentence.  As to Holmes, he returned refreshed to his monograph upon  the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus, which has since been printed for  private circulation, and is said by experts to be the last word upon  the subject.  Some weeks afterwards I learned incidentally that my  friend spent a day at Windsor, whence he returned with a remarkably  fine emerald tie-pin.  When I asked him if he had bought it, he  answered that it was a present from a certain gracious lady in whose  interests he had once been fortunate enough to carry out a small  commission.  He said no more; but I fancy that I could guess at that  lady's august name, and I have little doubt that the emerald pin will  forever recall to my friend's memory the adventure of the  Bruce-Partington plans."]]]
