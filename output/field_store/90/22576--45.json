The whisper flies around the clubs: 'Poor old  What's-his-name has been taken unawares. He cannot cope with the  situation!'\"    The man with the collar-studs made another diagnosis. He was seeing  clearer and clearer into the thing every minute.    \"Looney!\" he decided. \"This 'ere one's bin moppin' of it up, and  the one in the keb's orf 'is bloomin' onion. That's why 'e 's  standin' up instead of settin'. 'E won't set down 'cept you bring  'im a bit o' toast, 'cos he thinks 'e 's a poached egg.\"    George beamed upon the intelligent fellow.    \"Your reasoning is admirable, but--\"    He broke off here, not because he had not more to say, but for the  reason that the stout young man, now in quite a Berserk frame of  mind, made a sudden spring at the cab door and clutched the handle,  which he was about to wrench when George acted with all the  promptitude and decision which had marked his behaviour from the  start.    It was a situation which called for the nicest judgment. To allow  the assailant free play with the handle or even to wrestle with him  for its possession entailed the risk that the door might open and  reveal the girl. To bust the young man on the jaw, as promised, on  the other hand, was not in George's eyes a practical policy.  Excellent a deterrent as the threat of such a proceeding might be,  its actual accomplishment was not to be thought of. Gaols yawn and  actions for assault lie in wait for those who go about the place  busting their fellows on the jaw. No. Something swift, something  decided and immediate was indicated, but something that stopped  short of technical battery.    George brought his hand round with a sweep and knocked the stout  young man's silk hat off.    The effect was magical. We all of us have our Achilles heel,  and--paradoxically enough--in the case of the stout young man that  heel was his hat. Superbly built by the only hatter in London who  can construct a silk hat that is a silk hat, and freshly ironed by  loving hands but a brief hour before at the only shaving-parlour in  London where ironing is ironing and not a brutal attack, it was his  pride and joy. To lose it was like losing his trousers. It made him  feel insufficiently clad. With a passionate cry like that of some  wild creature deprived of its young, the erstwhile Berserk released  the handle and sprang in pursuit. At the same moment the traffic  moved on again.    The last George saw was a group scene with the stout young man in  the middle of it. The hat had been popped up into the infield,  where it had been caught by the messenger boy. The stout young man  was bending over it and stroking it with soothing fingers. It was  too far off for anything to be audible, but he seemed to George to  be murmuring words of endearment to it. Then, placing it on his  head, he darted out into the road and George saw him no more. The  audience remained motionless, staring at the spot where the  incident had happened. They would continue to do this till the next  policeman came along and moved them on.    With a pleasant wave of farewell, in case any of them might be  glancing in his direction, George drew in his body and sat down.    The girl in brown had risen from the floor, if she had ever been  there, and was now seated composedly at the further end of the cab.        CHAPTER 4.    \"Well, that's that!\" said George.    \"I'm so much obliged,\" said the girl.    \"It was a pleasure,\" said George.    He was enabled now to get a closer, more leisurely and much more  satisfactory view of this distressed damsel than had been his good  fortune up to the present. Small details which, when he had first  caught sight of her, distance had hidden from his view, now  presented themselves. Her eyes, he discovered, which he had  supposed brown, were only brown in their general colour-scheme.  They were shot with attractive little flecks of gold, matching  perfectly the little streaks of gold which the sun, coming out again  on one of his flying visits and now shining benignantly once more on  the world, revealed in her hair. Her chin was square and  determined, but its resoluteness was contradicted by a dimple and  by the pleasant good-humour of the mouth; and a further softening  of the face was effected by the nose, which seemed to have started  out with the intention of being dignified and aristocratic but had  defeated its purpose by tilting very slightly at the tip. This was  a girl who would take chances, but would take them with a smile and  laugh when she lost.    George was but an amateur physiognomist, but he could read what was  obvious in the faces he encountered; and the more he looked at this  girl, the less he was able to understand the scene which had just  occurred. The thing mystified him completely. For all her  good-humour, there was an air, a manner, a something capable and  defensive, about this girl with which he could not imagine any man  venturing to take liberties. The gold-brown eyes, as they met his  now, were friendly and smiling, but he could imagine them freezing  into a stare baleful enough and haughty enough to quell such a  person as the silk-hatted young man with a single glance. Why,  then, had that super-fatted individual been able to demoralize her  to the extent of flying to the shelter of strange cabs? She was  composed enough now, it was true, but it had been quite plain that  at the moment when she entered the taxi her nerve had momentarily  forsaken her. There were mysteries here, beyond George.    The girl looked steadily at George and George looked steadily at  her for the space of perhaps ten seconds. She seemed to George to  be summing him up, weighing him. That the inspection proved  satisfactory was shown by the fact that at the end of this period  she smiled. Then she laughed, a clear pealing laugh which to George  was far more musical than the most popular song-hit he had ever  written.    \"I suppose you are wondering what it's all about?\" she said.    This was precisely what George was wondering most consumedly.    \"No, no,\" he said. \"Not at all. It's not my business.\"    \"And of course you're much too well bred to be inquisitive about  other people's business?\"    \"Of course I am. What was it all about?\"    \"I'm afraid I can't tell you.\"    \"But what am I to say to the cabman?\"    \"I don't know. What do men usually say to cabmen?\"    \"I mean he will feel very hurt if I don't give him a full  explanation of all this. He stooped from his pedestal to make  enquiries just now. Condescension like that deserves some  recognition.\"    \"Give him a nice big tip.\"    George was reminded of his reason for being in the cab.    \"I ought to have asked before,\" he said. \"Where can I drive you?\"    \"Oh, I mustn't steal your cab. Where were you going?\"    \"I was going back to my hotel. I came out without any money, so I  shall have to go there first to get some.\"    The girl started.    \"What's the matter?\" asked George.    \"I've lost my purse!\"    \"Good Lord! Had it much in it?\"    \"Not very much. But enough to buy a ticket home.\"    \"Any use asking where that is?\"    \"None, I'm afraid.\"    \"I wasn't going to, of course.\"    \"Of course not. That's what I admire so much in you. You aren't  inquisitive.\"    George reflected.    \"There's only one thing to be done. You will have to wait in the  cab at the hotel, while I go and get some money. Then, if you'll  let me, I can lend you what you require.\"    \"It's much too kind of you. Could you manage eleven shillings?\"    \"Easily. I've just had a legacy.\"    \"Of course, if you think I ought to be economical, I'll go  third-class. That would only be five shillings. Ten-and-six is the  first-class fare. So you see the place I want to get to is two  hours from London.\"    \"Well, that's something to know.\"    \"But not much, is it?\"    \"I think I had better lend you a sovereign. Then you'll be able to  buy a lunch-basket.\"    \"You think of everything. And you're perfectly right. I shall be  starving. But how do you know you will get the money back?\"    \"I'll risk it.\"    \"Well, then, I shall have to be inquisitive and ask your name.  Otherwise I shan't know where to send the money.\"    \"Oh, there's no mystery about me. I'm an open book.\"    \"You needn't be horrid about it. I can't help being mysterious.\"    \"I didn't mean that.\"    \"It sounded as if you did. Well, who is my benefactor?\"    \"My name is George Bevan. I am staying at the Carlton at present.\"    \"I'll remember.\"    The taxi moved slowly down the Haymarket. The girl laughed.    \"Yes?\" said George.    \"I was only thinking of back there. You know, I haven't thanked you  nearly enough for all you did. You were wonderful.\"    \"I'm very glad I was able to be of any help.\"    \"What did happen? You must remember I couldn't see a thing except  your back, and I could only hear indistinctly.\"    \"Well, it started by a man galloping up and insisting that you had  got into the cab. He was a fellow with the appearance of a  before-using advertisement of an anti-fat medicine and the manners  of a ring-tailed chimpanzee.\"    The girl nodded.    \"Then it was Percy! I knew I wasn't mistaken.\"    \"Percy?\"    \"That is his name.\"    \"It would be! I could have betted on it.\"    \"What happened then?\"    \"I reasoned with the man, but didn't seem to soothe him, and  finally he made a grab for the door-handle, so I knocked off his  hat, and while he was retrieving it we moved on and escaped.\"    The girl gave another silver peal of laughter.    \"Oh, what a shame I couldn't see it. But how resourceful of you!  How did you happen to think of it?\"    \"It just came to me,\" said George modestly.    A serious look came into the girl's face. The smile died out of her  eyes. She shivered.    \"When I think how some men might have behaved in your place!\"    \"Oh, no. Any man would have done just what I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22344"],[0,"Remarks on the Subject of Lactation (#7)"],[1,"publicly to avail myself of  such communications, it is, perhaps, unnecessary to say, I shall not  neglect the opportunity of expressing my acknowledgments to their  respective authors. The intelligence and liberality characterising the  members of the medical profession generally, preclude all apprehension  on my part that the above appeal will be made in vain.

I beg leave to observe that I make these statements with some confidence  as the result of personal inquiries instituted a few years ago among the  patients of two of the Lying-in Establishments of this metropolis.      C (page 8).    Since the above was written, a friend who lectures on Chemistry in the  metropolis has kindly promised me his valuable assistance in making the  experiments here suggested.      D (page 10).    In two cases where suckling was protracted to _three years_, the  subjects of this baneful practice did not equal in size an ordinary  child of half their age. One of them became idiotic, and afterwards died  of Hydrencephalus, under my care; the other was affected with Tabes  Mesenterica,--the result I did not witness--but believe the disease  terminated fatally.      E (page 25).    Vide Medical and Physical Journal for August 1827.      F (page 25).    That is, any period beyond nine or ten months.      G (page 25).    _Meningitis_,--I use this term as being more pathologically correct than  _Cephalitis_, which I formerly adopted.      H (page 26).    See the above conditional sense in which I employ this term.      I (page 26).    It is a curious fact, which I believe has not been noticed by any other  writer, that female children labouring under attacks of Meningitis are  sometimes affected with leucorrh[oe]al discharges. I have met with  several cases of this description: the children also of women subject to  leucorrh[oe]a will often, at an early age, be found affected with the  same disease. Hence it would appear that leucorrh[oe]a is occasionally  hereditary.      K (page 37).    It is unquestionable, notwithstanding the scepticism of some  practitioners on the subject, (whose opinions are entitled to  deference,) that _recovery may take place, under appropriate treatment,  in cases of Meningitis, even after effusion has unequivocally occurred_.  Preceding authors have noticed this fact, which I can confirm by my own  experience. Practitioners cannot be too frequently reminded of it, and  warned not to despair of success even in the last stage of  Hydrencephalus.      L (page 42).    For the information of the _unprofessional_ reader, I beg to observe,  that the membranes of the brain are _serous membranes_.      M (page 48).    It will be observed hereafter, that Mr. North has experienced similar  beneficial effects from the course above recommended, in cases where  _convulsions_ have been caused by _diseased milk_;--a strong  corroborative coincidence.
