With the Free State  neutral, the aspect of affairs might have been entirely changed, and  Dundee, with Ladysmith to support it, might have held its own. As it  was, these small places were from the first placed in the most  unenviable quandary.    General Symons, on the arrival of Sir George White in Natal, took  command of the forces in Dundee, and began active preparations for the  reception of the Dutchmen.    [Illustration: MAP OF NORTHERN NATAL. SCALE 15 STATUTE MILES TO THE  INCH.]    The latter, immediately after the declaration of war, took possession of  Newcastle, and our patrols soon came in touch with the enemy. In spite  of their animated and aggressive movements, however, Sir W. Penn Symons  was disinclined to believe that the enemy meant a serious attack upon  Dundee, and though fully prepared for hostilities, he was somewhat  amazed when really informed of the rapid advance of the united  Republicans. But he lost no time. He made inquiries, and satisfied  himself that he was in a position of some danger and that he must  promptly leap to action. The chief difficulty of the situation lay in  the number of passes through which the Boers with their easily mobilised  forces could manage to pour in bodies of men, and the limited number of  British troops at General Symons's disposal. From the movements of the  Boers it was obvious that the plan of attack had long been cleverly and  carefully arranged. The Free State Boers on the 12th of October seized  Albertina Station, near the Natal frontier, and took possession of the  key, the stationmaster having to make his way on a trolley to Ladysmith.  There, as yet, all was externally peaceful, as though no enemy were  near, but a suppressed anxiety to be \"up and at 'em\" prevailed among the  troops. Their ardour was in nowise damped by the incessant rain that  fell, and converted the surrounding country into a wide morass, nor by  the snow that followed, which gave the Drakenberg Mountains an  additionally impregnable aspect and rendered them at once picturesque  and forbidding.    A steady increase of the commandoes in the neighbourhood of Doornberg  continued, and an attack within a few days seemed imminent.    Thereupon a large number of troops left Ladysmith for Acton Homes, where  a Boer commando of four miles long was reported to be laagered. But the  Boers retreated, and the troops remained some ten miles from Ladysmith,  the Dublin Fusiliers alone moving back to Glencoe, whence they had come  by train by order of General Symons.    At Glencoe we had, as before stated, some 4000 men, but report said that  General Viljeon had an enormous force, nearly double ours in number,  which was lying at the foot of Botha's Pass, one and a half miles on the  Natal side of the Border. Besides this, General Kock had a commando at  Newcastle. The invasion of Natal by the Boers in three columns was  formally announced by an official statement from the Governor:--                                          \"PIETERMARITZBURG, _October 16_.    \"Natal was invaded from the Transvaal early on the morning of the 12th  inst., an advance being made by the enemy in three columns. On the right  a mixed column of Transvaal and Free State Burghers with Hollander  Volunteers marched through Botha's Pass. In the centre the main column,  under General Joubert's personal command, crossed Lang's Nek and moved  forward _via_ Ingogo. On the left a large commando advanced from  Wakkerstroom _via_ Moll's Nek and Wool's Drift. The object of all three  columns was Newcastle, which was occupied on the night of the 14th, the  central column having slept the previous night at Mount Prospect,  General Colley's old camping-place. On Sunday an advance party of 1500  Boers, with artillery, pushed south of Ingagane, but the greater portion  of this commando retired later in the day on Newcastle. A Boer force  which had been concentrating at De Jager's Drift captured six Natal  policemen. A picket of the King's Royal Rifles Mounted Infantry has  exchanged a few shots with the enemy. This has hitherto been the only  fighting.    \"A large force of Free State Boers, estimated at from 11,000 to 13,000,  is watching the passes of the Drakensberg from Olivier's Hoek to  Collins's Pass. They have pushed a few patrols down the berg, but  hitherto the main force has not debouched from the actual passes, which  are being intrenched.\"    As will be seen, the advance of the foe seemed to be converging on Sir  George White's position from all directions, and threatening Glencoe  from the north, east, and possibly west. Still the troops remained  cheerful and looked forward to a brush with the enemy. On the 18th  hostilities were begun by the Free State commando moving about ten miles  down the Tintwa Pass. They opened fire with their artillery on some  small cavalry patrols, but their shooting was distinctly inferior, and  no one was injured. They retreated on the advance of the 5th Lancers.  Several more commandoes were known to have advanced to join a force  stationed at Doornberg, some twelve miles from Dundee, and the enemy's  scouts having also been seen some seven miles off Glencoe, an engagement  was expected at any moment. An interesting account of this interval of  suspense was given by an officer writing on the 16th October from  Dundee, interesting and pathetic, too, when, in reading it, we remember  that the gallant fellow to whom the writer alluded is alive no longer.  He said:--    \"Hitherto there has been no fighting at all, but our patrols are in  touch with the enemy. I was out on my first patrol the day before  yesterday since the declaration of war. My orders were to start at 6  A.M., push on about twelve miles along the Newcastle road, and stay out  till about 6 P.M. I went out to a small hill about four miles from the  camp and reconnoitered, and then went on to a place called Hadding  Spruit, where I found a few people at the station and the stationmaster.  This is at present the terminus of the line, all the rolling stock north  of this having been sent south, and all the wires cut and instruments  removed by the railway people. There is a large coal-mine here, and the  people are in a deadly funk about being blown up. I pushed on to a large  kopje, a few miles this side and west of Dannhauser, and climbed to the  top, where I spent an hour or so, as from there one can see as far as  Ingagane Nek, four miles this side of Newcastle, the place I sketched.  Just as I looked over the top of the hill I saw two men on ponies with  guns. They were talking to a Kaffir. I at once put them down as Boers,  and thought of firing at them, but decided not to disclose my position  and watch them. This was lucky for them, as I caught them later, and  found them to be refugees flying from the Boers, who I discovered were  in occupation of Ingagane and Newcastle, and had their patrols out  nearly to Dannhauser.    \"I then went on to Dannhauser, which consists of a railway station, two  farms, a store, a couple of coolie stores, a mine, and a few huts. We  approached with magazines charged and expected to see a Boer every  minute, but found that they were not expected to come down as far as  that till next day. I then made my way slowly back by the main road, and  reached camp about 5 P.M., when I found that the other patrol (six men  and an officer is the strength of each) had proceeded to De Jager's  Drift and had not returned. A telephonic communication from the  police-station at De Jager's Drift said, 'A large force of forty Boers  have crossed Buffalo to cut off your patrol. Am trying ...'--and then  ended abruptly. It eventually transpired that the Boers rushed the  police-station before the message could be completed. Thackwell, who was  in command of the patrol, pursued twelve Boers up to the river. Then  thirty-four crossed to our side, and twelve lower down, the twelve  trying to cut him off behind. However, he retired on to a nek behind,  and as they did not come on, he moved off in about half an hour by  another road. This was lucky for him, as he saw the twelve men who had  crossed by Landsman's Drift disconsolately coming down from a lot of  rocks where they had been lying in wait for him on the road he had come  by.    \"There seems to have been something going on at Kimberley. I wish they  would buck up here and do something. I am on picket to-night, which  means no sleep and a lot of bother, as the picket is about seven miles  from camp at the junction of the Vant's Drift and De Jager's Drift  roads, where there is a chance of being plugged at. The picket on the  Helmakaar road was shot at the other night.    \"One of the armoured trains came up here yesterday--an ugly-looking  beast with the engine in the middle, all covered with iron, so that only  just the top of the funnel is visible. I do not believe in them. If any  one puts a dynamite cartridge under a rail--pop! up goes the armoured  train.    \"I think this will be a very interesting war, as the railway will play  such an important part in the tactics. Thus the other day we sent the  Dublin Fusiliers down to Ladysmith to repel an expected attack at  half-an-hour's notice, and brought them back the same night....    \"We are under an awfully nice General--one Penn Symons--a real good  chap.\"    On the 18th of October the Carabineers were in touch with the enemy in  the neighbourhood of Bester's Farm a great part of the day, and  Lieutenant Galway, son of the Chief-Justice of Natal, who remained to  watch his troops off the kopje, was reported missing. The Carabineers  were compelled to retire owing to being completely outnumbered by the  Boer force, and had they not done so they would have run the risk of  being cut off from their supports. There were some hair-breadth escapes,  and Major "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26278"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume 1, (#7)"],[1," incomprehensible belong, also, to the domain of  scientific investigation. If the infinite can not be comprehended,  matter can not be comprehended, and if all that can not be comprehended  should be dismissed from scientific investigation, then matter should be  dismissed.    In physical science we know the vital force exists which builds the germ  and sperm cells, but we do not comprehend it. If you ask physical  science to explain this invisible force or power, she will say,  Gentlemen, I have given you an introduction to this wonderful builder;  you see it is there at the threshold of organic being, but I can not  tell you why it is there, nor what its properties are; if it has any,  they are outside of my domain. I deal with matter. You must ask at the  gate of the unseen, ask the science of the spiritual, the mental and  vital. I am in wonderful contrast with mind, with life also. I am  inertia. Some of my votaries have tried to give you the answer which you  so much desire. They have said, \"It is the all-pervading force which was  lying away back in the antechambers of eternity.\" Have said, \"It was  burdened with a universe of worlds.\" Have said, \"It was destitute of  personality.\" Have said, \"It was not, and is not, an intelligence.\" Have  said, \"It was without will, purpose or desire.\" Have said, \"All beauty,  harmony and order were its results.\" Have also said, \"It was,\" away back  in the ages past, groaning and heaving, travailing, in great anxiety to  be delivered. Speaking of it in the light of \"natural selection,\" they  have deified it, giving to it all the mental operations of an  intelligent, living God. On this account some of my lovers are  Pantheists. They deify nature; deify everything, and call it all God. A  few ignorant Christians, on this very account, are ready to give up  their warfare with Pantheists. But the battle is not won because the  word \"God\" is pronounced; for sober reason says, If nature is _all_  God, she is _a_ God, who is no God; or a nature without a God, just as  you choose to express it. After all, it remains an axiom, that \"you can  not get more out of a thing than there is in it.\" So, of necessity,  there must be, somewhere in this universe, _Eternal life and mind_.  Reader, \"how readest thou?\"          BLIND FORCE OR INTELLIGENCE, WHICH?      In the discussion of this question I think it proper to submit a few  axiomatic or common-sense truths which are universally admitted by the  unbiased mind.    _First._ \"Every effect must have a cause.\"    _Secondly._ \"Every series must have a unit lying at its base.\"    _Thirdly._ \"In every beginning there must be that which began.\"    _Fourthly._ \"Something is eternal.\"    _Fifthly._ \"There can not be an endless succession of dependent things.\"    _Sixthly._ \"There must be that upon which the first dependent link in  the chain of dependent things depended.\"    _Seventhly._ \"That thing, whatever it may be, upon which the first  dependent thing depended, must be eternal.\"    Was it blind force or intelligence, which?    The existence of a supreme intelligence is the first great leading  thought made known in the Bible.    The first that is made known in unbelief, is the existence of \"the  unknown.\"    When a man adopts the idea of the unknown, he lays down all his strength  to oppose the idea of a supreme intelligence, for what right has he to  dogmatize about the unknown? The use of the word force will not help us  to a better understanding of things. Force is simply the manifestation  of energy, and there must, necessarily, be something lying behind it to  which it, as an attribute or quality, belongs. That \"something\" the  Bible calls \"spirit.\" It has never been christened with a name by the  unbeliever. Force is the bridge between it and matter, and the bridge  between it and all things upon which it operates. The unbeliever's  \"unknown\" lies behind force. Has he ever given it a name?    So far as science is concerned, it is paying her proper respect to say  she demands an intelligence in order to account for the wonderful things  with which she has to deal. Laycock, treating upon the questions of mind  and brain, says: \"The phenomena of life present a vast series of  adjustments and modifications to fill certain purposes and bring about  ends.\"--_Mind and Brain, vol. 1, p. 222 to 224._    Systematic action in the use of means to accomplish certain ends or  purposes we regard as the evidence of intelligence. By what other means  do we distinguish between the rational and the insane? Winchel says, in  his \"Religion and Science,\" p. 102, \"Without God we can not account for  the correlation presented by the world of structural part to structural  part, of structural part to intelligible end, of structural part to  persistent plans or archetypes, of correlations which show that they  were anticipated.\"    Beal, on Protoplasm, p. 104 to 107, says, \"Living matter overcomes  gravitation and resists and suspends chemical affinity.\" He adds, \"It is  in direct opposition to chemical affinities that organized beings  exist.\"    What power is that which lies behind chemical affinities, and controls  them with direct reference to organic being? Will some bold unbeliever  answer?    Carpenter says, \"The most universal and fundamental attribute of life is  the mode of vital activity manifesting itself in the development of the  germ into the complete organism and type OF ITS PARENT, and the after  maintenance of the organism in its integrity at the expense of materials  derived from external sources. The life in the germ is the controlling  agency, superintending the building, charged with the working out the  design of the architect.\" Who is the architect? Or, if you prefer it,  what is the architect? Whoever he or whatever it may be, the design and  decrees of nature are with that official. All the changes that can be  made in environments or food will not change the organism from the type  of its parent. Then the structure of the male and the female with  reference to future living organisms, or procreation, is in very poor  harmony with the idea that the architect is \"blind force.\"    The same milk from one and the same animal, with the same heat and air,  will build up bodies of different types, one as well as another, making  human flesh in the human body, and dog's flesh in the dog's body, and  sheep's flesh in the sheep's body. If the living germinal organism has  its paternity in a dog, it will remain a dog in spite of food and  environments.    Carpenter says, \"The vital force,\" in the germ, \"is not the entire force  or means of growth; heat is a constructive stimulus, but amounts to  nothing where there is no life. Food is material for the building, but  like heat, it is of no consequence in the absence of life.\"    The constructing force in the germ manifests itself, in the plant, in  the conversion of the insoluble starch of the seed into sugar, and in an  additional change of a part of that sugar so as to set at liberty a  large amount of carbon, which, uniting with the oxygen of the air, forms  carbonic acid, and this process is attended with a liberation of heat  which supplies the germ with stimulus.    \"It is different with the advanced plant. The organic compounds required  to extend the fabric, are formed by the plant, instead of being supplied  from without. The tissues of the green surface of the stem and leaves  have the peculiar power, when acted on by light, of generating, at the  expense of carbonic acid, water and ammonia, with various ternary and  quarternary organic compounds, such as chlorophyll, starch, oil and  albumen. A part goes to build new tissues, and a part is stored up in  the cavities of tissues for food for parts to be developed in the  future.\" Mr. Carpenter says, \"Of the source of this peculiar power we  have no right to speak confidently.\" Is it a blind force that  anticipates growth in the plant, and lays away food, in the tissues,  for future use? Why should it be different with the young plant?    Sixteen simple substances are known to exist in vegetable organisms, and  many of them are more strongly inclined to unite with substances which  have no existence in vegetable cells; so they separate, in violation of  chemical laws, and unite in vegetable cells in utter disregard of the  affinities which are known to be their strongest. How do unbelievers  manage such objections to the hypothesis that chemical laws explain  everything in vegetable life? How is all this accounted for? We,  Christians, answer, \"The course of nature is the art of God.\" This  answer is equivalent to the thought that vegetable life is the result of  the union existing between God and the vegetable kingdom. The force that  lies behind all chemical affinities and controls them, together with the  wisdom displayed in that kingdom, belongs to God.          SPECIES, OR UNITS OF NATURE.      Are millions of years adequate as a cause, when associated with all the  forces known in nature, to produce new species and extirpate old ones?  The teachings of Darwin require an answer in the affirmative.    The survival of the fittest is one of Darwin's emphasized laws of  natural selection. He says: \"In all cases the new and improved forms of  life tend to supplant the old and unimproved forms. New varieties  continually take the place of and supplant the parent form. New and  improved varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the  older.\"--_Origin of Species, pp. 264, 266, 413._    Do the facts sustain this assumption? The little animals whose remains  compose the great chalk-beds are alive and working. Inarticulate or  molluscan life is seen in a sub-fossil condition in the Post Pliocene  clays of Canada. They are just as they were in the beginning of their  history. Species seem to be immutably fixed. The demand for millions of  years, in order to get old species out and new ones in, breaks down with  the mollusk of"]]]
