England has greater interests at stake at the mercy of  Russia than at that of France. With France the questions are  sometimes questions of jealousy, but, on the other hand, a tolerable  understanding keeps France quiet and secures the peace of Europe, much  more in the sense of the European policy of England than of that of  France. The only consolation the French can find in it is that they  are aware that _together_ with England they have a great position,  but they always lament that they can _get nothing by it_. A bad  understanding with France opens not only the door to a European war,  but also to revolution; and that is perhaps the most serious and most  awfully dangerous part of the business. England wants nothing from the  Emperor than that he should leave the _status quo_ of Europe and  great part of Asia alone. At Paris they are not so much moved at the  Emperor's visit as perhaps they ought to be, but they have put the  flattering notion into their heads that he had made _fiasco_, which is  _not true_; as, in fact, he has so far been rather _successful_, and  has convinced people in England that he is a mild and good-natured  man, himself and his Empire, without any ambition. Now it is high time  I should finish my immense scrawl, for which I claim your forgiveness,  remaining ever your devoted Uncle,    LEOPOLD R.          [Pageheading: TAHITI]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _27th August 1844._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--Many thanks for your kind long letter, which I  received yesterday, dated 23rd. I can report very well of ourselves.  We are all well. The dear day of yesterday[24] we spent very quietly  and happily and full of gratitude to Providence for so many blessings.  I can only pray for the continuance of our present happiness.    The impending political cloud, I hope and trust, looks less black and  lowering. But I think it very unwise in Guizot not to have at once  disavowed D'Aubigny for what you yourself call an \"outrage,\"[25]  instead of letting it drag on for _four weeks_ and letting our people  get excited. The Tangiers Affair[26] is unfortunate, and I hope that  in future poor Joinville will not be exposed to such disagreeable  affairs. What _can_ be done will be, to get him justified in the eyes  of the public here, but I fear that at first they will not be very  charitable. Those letters in the _Times_ are outrageous, and all that  abuse very bad taste.[27] There is to be an investigation about the  three officers, whose conduct is unworthy of Englishmen. Now, dearest  Uncle, believe me always, your most affectionate Niece,    VICTORIA R.        [Footnote 24: The Prince Albert's birthday.

As I have written an  account of our journey to Louise, I will _not_ repeat it here.    The good ending of our difficulties with France is an immense  blessing, but it is really and truly necessary that you and those  at Paris should know that the danger was _imminent_, and that poor  Aberdeen stood _almost alone_ in trying to keep matters peaceable.  We must try and prevent these difficulties for the future. I must,  however, clear _Jarnac_[28] of all blame, for Aberdeen does nothing  but praise him....    In Greece affairs look very black, and God knows how it all will end.        [Footnote 28: _Charge d'Affaires_ in the absence of the French      Ambassador.]          [Pageheading: VISIT OF KING LOUIS PHILIPPE]      _The Queen of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._    LAEKEN, _5th October 1844._    MY DEARLY BELOVED VICTORIA,--... I have not much to say about my  father's _lodging habits_ and _likings_.[29] My father is one of the  beings _most easy_ to _please_, _satisfy_, and to _accommodate_.  His eventful life has used him to everything, and makes any kind of  arrangements acceptable to him; there is only _one thing_ which  he _cannot easily do_, it is to be _ready very early_. He means  notwithstanding to try to come to your breakfast, but you _must insist  upon his not doing it_. It would disturb him in all his habits, and be  bad for him, as he would certainly eat, a thing he is not used to  do in the morning. He generally takes hardly what may be called a  _breakfast_, and eats _only twice_ in the day. It would be also _much  better_ for him if he only appeared to luncheon and dinner, and if you  kindly dispensed him altogether of the breakfast. You must not tell  him that I wrote you _this_, but you must manage it with Montpensier,  and kindly order for him a bowl of _chicken broth_. It is the only  thing he takes generally in the morning, and between his meals. I  have also no observation to make, but I have told Montpensier to speak  openly to Albert whenever he thought something ought to be done for my  father, or might hurt and inconvenience him, and you may consult him  when you are in doubt. He is entrusted with all the recommendations  of my mother, for my father is naturally _so imprudent_ and _so little  accustomed_ to _caution and care_, that he must in some measure be  _watched_ to prevent his catching cold or doing what may be injurious  to him. About his _rooms_, a hard bed and a large table for his papers  are the only things he requires. He generally sleeps on a horse-hair  mattress with a plank of wood under it: but _any kind_ of bed will do,  if it is not _too soft_. His liking will be to be entirely at _your  commands_ and to do _all you like_. You know he can take a great deal  of exercise, and _everything_ will _interest_ and _delight_ him, to  see, as to do: this is not a compliment, but a _mere fact_. His only  wish is, that you should not go out of your way for him, and change  your habits on his account. Lord Aberdeen will be, of course, at  Windsor, and I suppose you will ask, as you told me, the Royal Family.  My father hopes to see also Sir Robert Peel, Lord Stanley, and your  other Ministers. You will probably ask most of them during his stay.  He wishes very much to see again those he already knows, and to make  the acquaintance of those he does not know yet. In writing all this  I think I _dream_, I _cannot believe_ yet that in a few days my dear  father will have, God willing, the _unspeakable happiness_ to see you  again and at _Windsor_, a thing he had _so much wished_ for and which  for a _long time_ seemed so _improbable_. You have _no notion_ of the  _satisfaction_ it gives him, and _how delighted_ he will be to see you  again, and to be once more in England. God grant he may have a good  passage, and arrive to you _safely_ and _well_. _Unberufen_, as you  will soon, I trust, be able to see, he is, notwithstanding the usual  talk of the papers, _perfectly well_.... Yours most devotedly,    LOUISE.        [Footnote 29: The difficulty with France as to Tahiti having      been satisfactorily disposed of, King Louis Philippe was      enabled to visit England, the first French King to come on      a visit to the Sovereign of England. The King was      enthusiastically received in England, visited Claremont (which      he was destined to occupy in exile), was installed as a Knight      of the Garter at Windsor with great magnificence, and visited      Eton College and Woolwich Arsenal.]          [Pageheading: SOLICITUDE OF QUEEN LOUISE]      _The Queen of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._    LAEKEN, _7th October 1844._    MY DEARLY BELOVED VICTORIA,--... I wrote to my mother, to quiet her,  all you kindly tell me about my dear father. We are _quite sure_, I  assure you, that you and Albert will _take care of him_, and that he  is with you _in safe hand_. And what makes my mother _uneasy_ is the  fear that, being at liberty without control, he will make _too much_,  as she says, _le jeune homme_, ride, go about, and do everything as if  he was still twenty years old. If I must tell you _all the truth_, she  is afraid also he will _eat too much_. I am sure he will tell it to  you himself, as he was so much amused with _this fear_; but to do her  pleasure, being well assured by me that you would allow it, and that  it was even _customary_, he has given up, of himself, all thought of  attending your early breakfast: but I perceive I write as if _he was  not already_ under _your_ roof. I will also only say, that though he  has sent over his horses in case they should be wanted, my mother  begs you to _prevent, if possible, his riding at all_. I wrote to her  already that I supposed there would be _no occasion_ for riding,  and that your _promenades_ would be either on foot or in carriage.  I entrusted Montpensier with all my messages for you, my beloved  Victoria and your dear children. He hopes you will permit him, during  his stay at Windsor, to make _two_ excursions--one to London, and one  to Woolwich--he is very curious to see, as an artillery officer. I  mention it as he would be, perhaps, _too shy_ or _too discreet_ to  mention it himself. He might very well do those two trips by the  railroad and be back for dinner-time, and I am sure you will have no  objection to them.... Yours most devotedly,    LOUISE.
