But their dairy  qualities are perhaps as good as those of any cattle whose fattening  properties have been so carefully developed; and, though it is probable  that they could be bred for milk with proper care and attention, yet, as  this change would be at the expense of other qualities equally valuable,  it would evidently be wiser to resort to other stock for the dairy.      THE NORTH DEVONS.    [Illustration: A NORTH DEVON STEER.]    This beautiful race of middle horned cattle dates further back than any  well established breed among us. It goes generally under the simple name  of Devon; but the cattle of the southern part of the country, from which  the race derives its name, differ somewhat from those of the northern,  having a larger and coarser frame, and far less tendency to fatten  though their dairy qualities are superior.    The North Devons are remarkable for hardihood, symmetry and beauty, and  are generally bred for work and for beef, rather than for the dairy. The  head is fine and well set on; the horns of medium length, generally  curved; color usually bright blood-red, but sometimes inclining to  yellow; skin thin and orange-yellow; hair of medium length, soft and  silky, making the animals remarkable as handlers; muzzle of the nose  white; eyes full and mild; ears yellowish, or orange-color inside, of  moderate size; neck rather long, with little dewlap; shoulders oblique;  legs small and straight, with feet in proportion; chest of good width;  ribs round and expanded; loins of first-rate quality, long, wide, and  fleshy; hips round, of medium width; rump level; tail full near the  setting on, tapering to the tip; thighs of the bull and ox muscular and  full, and high in the flank, though in the cow sometimes thought to be  light; the size medium, generally called small. The proportion of meat  on the valuable parts is greater, and the offal less, than on most other  breeds, while it is well settled that they consume less food in its  production. The Devons are popular with the Smithfield butchers, and  their beef is well marbled or grained.    As working oxen, the Devons perhaps excel all other races in quickness,  docility, beauty, and the ease with which they are matched. With a  reasonable load, they are said to be equal to horses as walkers on the  road, and when they are no longer wanted for work they fatten easily and  turn well.    As milkers, they do not excel--perhaps they may be said not to  equal--the other breeds, and they have a reputation of being decidedly  below the average. In their native country the general average of the  dairy is one pound of butter a day during the summer. They are bred for  beef and for work, and not for the dairy; and their yield of milk is  small, though of a rich quality. Several animals, however, of the  celebrated Patterson herd would have been remarkable as milkers even  among good milking stock.    Still, the faults of the North Devon cow, considered as a dairy animal,  are too marked to be overlooked. The rotundity of form and compactness  of frame, though they contribute to her remarkable beauty constitute an  objection to her for this purpose: since it is generally admitted that  the peculiarity of form which disposes an animal to take on fat is  somewhat incompatible with good milking qualities. On this account,  Youatt--who is standard authority in such matters--says that for the  dairy the North Devon must be acknowledged to be inferior to several  other breeds. The milk is good, and yields more than the average  proportion of cream and butter; but it is deficient in quantity. He also  maintains that its property as a milker could not be improved without  producing a certain detriment to its grazing qualities. Distinguished  Devon breeders themselves have come to the same conclusion upon this  point. The improved North Devon cow may be classed, in this respect,  with the Hereford, neither of which has well developed milk-vessels--a  point of the utmost consequence to the practical dairyman.      NATIVE CATTLE.    The foregoing comprise the pure-bred races in America; for, though other  and well-established breeds--like the Galloways, the long horns, the  Spanish, and others--have, at times, been imported, and have had some  influence on our American stock, yet they have not been kept distinct to  such an extent as to become the prevailing stock of any particular  section.    A large proportion, however--by far the largest proportion, indeed--of  the cattle known among us cannot be included under any of the races to  which allusion has been made; and to the consideration of this class the  present article is devoted.    The term \"breed\"--as was set forth in the author's treatise, \"The Horse  and his Diseases\"--when properly understood, applies only to animals of  the same species, possessing, besides the general characteristics of  that species, other characteristics peculiar to themselves, which they  owe to the influence of soil, climate, nourishment, and the habits of  life to which they are subjected, and which they transmit with certainty  to their progeny. The characteristics of certain breeds or families are  so well marked, that, if an individual supposed to belong to any one of  them were to produce an offspring not possessing them, or possessing  them only in part, with others not belonging to the breed, it would be  just ground for suspecting a want of purity of bloods.    In this view, no grade animals, and no animals destitute of fixed  peculiarities or characteristics which they, share in common with all  other animals of the class of which they are a type, and which they are  capable of transmitting with certainty to their descendants, can be  recognized by breeders as belonging to any one distinct race, breed, or  family.    The term \"native\" is applied to a vast majority of our American cattle,  which, though born on the soil, and thus in one sense natives, do not  constitute a breed, race, or family, as correctly understood by  breeders. They do not possess characteristics peculiar to them all,  which they transmit with any certainty to their offspring, either of  form, size, color, milking or working properties.    But, though an animal may be made up of a mixture of blood almost to  impurity, it does not follow that, for specific purposes, it may not, as  an individual animal, be one of the best of the species. Indeed, for  particular purposes, animals might be selected from among those commonly  called \"natives\" in New England, and \"scrubs\" at the west and south,  equal, and perhaps superior, to any among the races produced by the most  skillful breeding.    There can be no objection, therefore, to the use of the term \"native,\"  when it is understood as descriptive of no known breed, but only as  applied to the common stock of a country, which does not constitute a  breed. But perhaps the entire class of animals commonly called \"natives\"  would be more accurately described as grades; since they are well known  to have sprung from a great variety of cattle procured at different  times and in different places on the continent of Europe, in England,  and in the Spanish West Indies, brought together without any regard to  fixed principles of breeding, but only from individual convenience, and  by accident.    The first importations to this country were doubtless those taken to  Virginia previous to 1609, though the exact date of their arrival is not  known. Several cows were carried there from the West Indies in 1610, and  in the next year no less than one hundred arrived there from abroad.    [Illustration: DRAFT OXEN.]    The earliest cattle imported into New England arrived in 1624. At the  division of cattle which took place three years after, one or two are  distinctly described as black, or black and white, others as brindle,  showing that there was no uniformity of color. Soon after this, a large  number of cattle were brought over from England for the settlers at  Salem. These importations formed the original stock of Massachusetts.    In 1725, the first importation was made into New York from Holland by  the Dutch West India Company, and the foundation was then laid for an  exceedingly valuable race of animals, which, subsequent importations  from the same country, as well as from England, have greatly improved.  The points and value of this race in its purity have been already  adverted to under the head of the Dutch cattle.    In 1627, cattle were brought from Sweden to the settlements on the  Delaware, by the Swedish West India Company. In 1631, 1632, and 1633,  several importations were made into New Hampshire by Captain John Mason  who, with Gorges, had procured the patent of large tracts of land in the  vicinity of the Piscataqua river, and who immediately formed settlements  there. The object of Mason was to carry on the manufacture of potash.  For this purpose he employed the Danes; and it was in his voyage to and  from Denmark that he procured many Danish cattle and horses, which were  subsequently scattered over that entire region, large numbers being  driven to the vicinity of Boston and sold. These Danish cattle are  described as large and coarse, of a yellow color; and it is supposed  that they were procured by Mason as being best capable of enduring the  severity of the climate and the hardships to which they would be  subjected.    However this may have been, they very soon spread among the colonists of  the Massachusetts Bay, and have undoubtedly left their marks on the  stock of the New England and the Middle States, which exist to some  extent even to the present day, mixed in with an infinite multitude of  crosses with the Devons, the Dutch cattle already alluded to, the black  cattle of Spain and Wales, and the long horn and the short horn--most of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22775"],[0,"Psychotherapy (#7)"],[1,"are after all as  physical facts the movements of lips and tongue and vocal cords and  chest; in short, a whole system of physical responses has set in through  a mental experience. But the same thought may be the starting-point for  many other bodily changes; it may make me blush, and that means that  large groups of blood-vessels become dilated; or I may get pale, the  blood-vessels are contracted. Or I may cry, the lachrymal gland is  working; or it may spoil my appetite, the membranes of my stomach cease  to produce; or my muscles may tremble, or my skin may perspire; in  short, my whole organism may resound with mental excitement which some  words may set up.    But it is not only the impression of outer stimuli and the expression of  inner thoughts in which mind and body come together. Daily life teaches  us, for instance, how our mental states are dependent upon most various  bodily influences. If the temperature of the blood is raised in fever,  the mental processes may go over into far-reaching confusion; if hashish  is smoked, the mind wanders to paradise, and a few glasses of wine may  give a new mental optimism and exuberance; a cup of tea may make us  sociable, a dose of bromide may annihilate the irritation of our mind,  and when we inhale ether, the whole content of consciousness fades away.  In every one of these cases, the body received the chemical substance,  the blood absorbed and carried it to the brain, and the change in the  brain was accompanied by a change in the mental behavior. Even ordinary  sleep at night presents itself surely as a bodily state--the fatigued  brain cells demand their rest, and yet at the same time the whole mental  life becomes entirely changed. It is not difficult to carry over such  observations of daily life to the more exact studies of the  psychological laboratory and to examine with the subtle means of the  psychological experiment the mental variations which occur with changes  of physical conditions. We might feel, without instruments, that our  ideas pass on more easily after a few cups of strong coffee, but the  laboratory may measure that with its exact methods and study in  thousandth parts of a second, the quickening or retarding in the flow of  ideas. Every subjective illusion is then excluded, our electrical  clocks, which measure the rapidity of mental action and of thought  association, will show then beyond doubt how every change in the  organism influences the processes of the mind. Bodily fatigue and  indigestion, physical health and blood circulation, everything,  influence our mental make-up. In the same way it is the laboratory  experiment which shows by the subtlest means that every mental state  produces bodily effects where we ordinarily ignore them. As soon as we  apply the equipment of the psychological workshop, it is easy to show  that even the slightest feeling may have its influence on the pulse and  the respiration, on the blood circulation and on the glands; or, that  our thoughts give impulse to our muscles and move our organs when we  ourselves are entirely unaware of it.    Again we may turn in another direction. Pathology shows us how every  physical disablement of the brain is accompanied by mental processes.  If the blood supply to the brain is cut off, we faint; a blow on the  head may wipe out the memory of the preceding hours, and a hemorrhage in  the brain, the bursting of a blood vessel which destroys groups of brain  cells, produces serious defects in the mental content. A tumor in the  brain may completely change the personality; the bodily disease of  certain convolutions in the brain brings with it the loss of the power  of speech; paralysis of the brain dissolves the whole mental  personality. Physical inhibition in the growth of the brain involves, on  the mental side, feeble-mindedness and idiocy. Of course, all this is  not sufficient to bring out a definite parallelism between special  mental functions and special physical processes, as the phenomena are  extremely complex. If a patient who has suffered from a mental  disturbance dies, and his brain is examined, there is no simple  correlation before us. It may be difficult to diagnose exactly the  mental symptoms. If we have heard that the man was unable to read, we do  not know from that what really happened in his brain. He may not have  read because he did not see the words, or because the letters were  confusing, or because he had lost memory for the meaning, or because he  had lost the impulse to speak the words, or because he felt unable to  turn his attention, or because the impulse to read aloud was not carried  out by his organism, or because an inner voice told him that it is a sin  to read, or for many similar reasons; and yet each one represents  psychologically an entirely different situation. On the other hand, on  the physical side, the destruction is probably not confined to one  particular spot. Complications have crept over to other places or the  disturbance in one part works as inhibitory influence on other brain  parts, or a tumor may press on a far-removed part, or the disturbance  may be one which cannot be examined with our present microscopic means.  In short, we have always a complex mental situation and a complex  physical one, and to find definite correlations may be possible only by  the comparison of very many cases.    Other methods, however, may supplement the pathological one. The  comparative anatomist shows us that the development of the central  nervous system in the kingdom of animals goes parallel to the  development of the mental functions, and that it is not only a question  of progress along all lines. Any special function of the mind may have  in certain animal groups an especially high development, and we see  certain parts correspondingly developed. The dog has certainly a keener  sense of smell than the man--the part of the brain which is in direct  connection with the olfactory nerve is correspondingly much bulkier in  the dog's brain than in the human organism. Here too, of course,  research may be carried to the subtlest details and the microscope has  to tell the full story. Not the differences in the big structure, but  the microscopical differences in the brain cells of special parts are to  be held responsible. But comparison may not be confined to the various  species of animals; it may refer not less to the various stages of man.  The genetic psychologist knows how the child's mind develops in a  regular rhythm, one mental function after another, how the first days  and first weeks and first months in the infant's life have their  characteristic mental possibilities, and no mental function can be  anticipated there. The new-born child can taste milk, but cannot hear  music. The anatomist shows us that correspondingly only certain nervous  tracts have the anatomical equipment by which they become ready for  functioning. Most of the tracts at first lack the so-called medullar  sheath, and from month to month new paths are provided with this  physical equipment.    Finally we have the experiment of the physiologist. His vivisectional  experiments, for instance, demonstrate that the electrical stimulation  of a definite spot on the surface of a dog's brain produces movements  which we should ordinarily take as expressions of mental states,  movements of the front legs or of the tail, movements of barking or  whining. On the other hand, the dog becomes unable to fulfill the mental  impulses if certain definite parts of his brain are destroyed. The  physiologist may show from the monkey down to the pigeon, to the frog,  to the ant, to the worm, how the behavior of animals is changed as soon  as certain groups of nervous elements are extirpated. It is the mental  emotional character of the pigeon which is changed when the physiologist  cuts off parts of his brain. In short, stimulation and destruction  demonstrate, by experiments which supplement each other, that mental  functions correspond to brain functions.    There is thus no lack of demonstration from all quarters that mental  facts and brain processes belong together; and yet, however much we may  cumulate such popular and scientific observations, they would never by  themselves admit of the sweeping generalization that there cannot be any  mental state which is not accompanied by a process in the central  nervous system. Someone might say, to be sure, the perceptions and  memory images, the volitions and instincts and impulses, have their  physiological basis, but there remain after all acts of attention, or  decisions, or subtle feelings, or flights of imagination, which are  independent of any brain action. Here, indeed, observation cannot settle  such a general principle. Its real hold lies in the fact with which we  started: there is no causal connection in the mental states as such. If  we want to understand mental facts as such in a chain, of causal events,  we have first to conceive them as parallel to physical events. The  principle of psychophysical parallelism, that is, the principle that  every psychical process accompanies a physiological change is thus not a  mere result of observation. It is simply a postulate. Every science  begins with postulates and only that which fulfills such postulates has  the dignity of truth in the midst of that scientific realm. The  astronomer cannot find by observation that there is no star the  movements of which are not the effects of foregoing causes. He knows it  beforehand, he demands it, he does not recognize any movement as  understood until he has found the causes, he presupposes that such  causes exist, that no star moves simply by a magic power, and that  nowhere in the astronomical universe is the chain of causality broken.  He postulates it, and where he does not discover the causes, he is sure  that he has not solved the real problem.    In the same way the psychologist who aims towards"]]]
