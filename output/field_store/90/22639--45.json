To each of these wards was appointed a  field-cornet, who had military duties when a commando was called  out. The officer who took the chief command of the field-cornets was  styled the commandant. This arrangement first originated in the  early days of their emigration to the Cape, when the natives,  lawless and inimical, were perpetually bursting out without rhyme or  reason. Naturally prompt defence became necessary. To many people  the Boer appears to be a \"first-class fighting man.\" Certainly he is  determined, obstinate, and, in his peculiar fashion, brave. But  there are others who can recall events in the battle with Dingaan,  in the tragedy of Majuba Hill, which scarcely add to the honour of  the Boer as a soldier. It has been said that the Boer prefers to do  his fighting without risking his skin, but this may be somewhat  unjust. He is ready enough to risk his skin, but he is equally ready  that some one shall pay for the risk, and he makes him pay by fair  means if he can--if not, by foul.    However, Livingstone knew his man, and thus it was that he wrote of  him: \"The Boers have generally manifested a marked antipathy to  anything but 'long shot' warfare, and sidling away in their  emigrations towards the more effeminate Bechuanas, have left their  quarrels with the Kaffirs to be settled by the English, and their  wars to be paid for by English gold.\" Obviously their methods of  warfare were, to say the least of it, curious. Sometimes they would  drive a battalion of friendly natives or slaves in front of them,  and shoot down their enemies from behind the shelter of these  advanced guards. Occasionally they employed a method similar to that  used against the Zulus of Dingaan. According to Livingstone's essay,  written in 1853, and not published till after his death, \"the Boers  approach the Zulus to within 300 or 400 yards, then fire, and retire  to a considerable distance and reload their guns. The Zulus pursuing  have by this time come sufficiently near to receive another  discharge from the Boers, who again retire as before. This process  soon tires out the fleetest warriors, and except through an  accident, or the stumbling of a horse or its rider's drunkenness, no  Boer ever stands a chance of falling into their hands. The Boers  report of themselves that they behaved with great bravery on the  occasion.\" In fact they said that they had killed from 3000 to 5000  Zulus, with the loss to themselves of only six men. Mr. Fisher, in  his book on \"The Transvaal and the Boers,\" avers that in the  subsequent war with the Griquas--who, being the bastard children of  the Boers, possess many of their peculiarities--the two opposing  parties kept at such ludicrous distances that the springboks quietly  grazing on the plains between were frequently shot instead of the  combatants.      SOME DOMESTIC TRAITS    For the domestic character of the Boer we will consult the  Scandinavian traveller Sparrmann, who gives us one of the earliest  sketches of the Boer \"at home.\" Though the illusion that the  industrious and cleanly Hollander was merely transplanted from one  soil to another is somewhat dispelled, the picture is generally  acknowledged to be a true one.    \"It is hardly to be conceived,\" he wrote in 1776, \"with what little  trouble the Boer gets into order a field of a moderate size ... so  that ... he may be almost said to make the cultivation of it, for  the bread he stands in need of for himself and his family, a mere  matter of amusement.... With pleasure, but without the least trouble  to himself, he sees the herds and flocks which constitute his riches  daily and considerably increasing. These are driven to pasture and  home again by a few Hottentots or slaves, who likewise make the  butter; so that it is almost only with the milking that the farmer,  together with his wife and children, concern themselves at all. To  do this business, however, he has no occasion to rise before seven  or eight o'clock in the morning.... That they (the Boers) might not  put their arms and bodies out of the easy and commodious posture in  which they had laid them on the couch when they were taking their  afternoon _siesta_, they have been known to receive travellers lying  quite still and motionless, excepting that they have very civilly  pointed out the road by moving their foot to the right or left....  Among a set of beings so devoted to their ease, one might naturally  expect to meet with a variety of the most commodious easy-chairs and  sofas; but the truth is, that they find it much more commodious to  avoid the trouble of inventing and making them.... Nor did the  inhabitants exhibit much less simplicity and moderation; or, to  speak more properly, slovenliness and penury in their dress than in  their furniture.... The distance at which they are from the Cape  may, indeed, be some excuse for their having no other earthenware or  china in their houses but what was cracked or broken; but this,  methinks, should not prevent them being in possession of more than  one or two old pewter pots, and some few plates of the same metal;  so that two people are frequently obliged to eat out of one dish,  besides using it for every different article of food that comes upon  the table. Each guest must bring his knife with him, and for forks  they frequently make use of their fingers. The most wealthy farmer  here is considered as being well dressed in a jacket of home-made  cloth, or something of the kind made of any other coarse cloth,  breeches of undressed leather, woollen stockings, a striped  waistcoat, a cotton handkerchief about his neck, a coarse calico  shirt, Hottentot field-shoes, or else leathern shoes with brass  buckles, and a coarse hat. Indeed, it is not in dress, but in the  number and thriving condition of their cattle, and chiefly in the  stoutness of their draught oxen, that these peasants vie with each  other. It is likewise by activity and manly actions, and by other  qualities that render a man fit for the married state, and the  rearing of a family, that the youth chiefly obtain the esteem of the  fair sex.... A plain close cap and a coarse cotton gown, virtue and  good housewifery, are looked upon by the fair sex as sufficient  ornaments for their persons; a flirting disposition, coquetry and  paint would have very little effect in making conquests of young men  brought up in so hardy a manner, and who have had so homely and  artless an education as the youth in this place. In short, here, if  anywhere in the world, one may lead an innocent, virtuous, and happy  life.\"    When viewing this study of rustic indolence, we must remember also  the conditions under which it was found. The natural fertility of  the country, the demoralising influence of slave-owning, the great  heat of the climate, were responsible for the change that so soon  came over the primitive Dutch character. Dr. Theal's account of the  Boer adds colour to the picture given by the Swede, and shows us  that a certain sense of refinement was lurking in the stolid and  not too picturesque disposition:--    \"The amusements of the people were few.... Those who possessed  numerous slaves usually had three or four of them trained to the use  of the violin, the blacks being peculiarly gifted with an ear for  music, and easily learning to play by sound. They had thus the means  at hand of amusing themselves with dancing, and of entertaining  visitors with music. The branches of widely extended families were  constantly exchanging visits with each other. A farmer would make  his waggon ready regularly every year, when half the household or  more would leave home, and spend a week or two with each relative,  often being absent a couple of months. Birthday anniversaries of  aged people were celebrated by the assembling of their descendants,  frequently to the number of eighty or a hundred, at the residence of  the patriarch, when a feast was prepared for their entertainment.  These different reunions were naturally productive of great  pleasure, and tended to cement the friendship and love of those who  otherwise might seldom see each other. The life led by the people  when at home was exceedingly tame. The mistress of the house, who  moved about but little, issued orders to slaves or Hottentot females  concerning the work of the household. If the weather was chilly or  damp, she rested her feet on a little box filled with live coals,  while beside her stood a coffee-kettle never empty. The head of the  family usually inspected his flocks morning and evening, and passed  the remainder of the day, like his helpmate, in the enjoyment of  ease. When repose itself became wearisome, he mounted his horse,  and, with an attendant to carry his gun, set off in pursuit of some  of the wild animals with which the country then abounded. The  children had few games, and, though strong and healthy, were far  from sprightly.\"    [Illustration: A KAFFIR KRAAL IN THE TRANSVAAL.    Photo by Wilson, Aberdeen.]    A dislike for the English seems to have been felt by the Cape Dutch  very early. This dislike later hostilities must have heightened; but  as far back as 1816 we learn that even shrewd and sensible farmers  were heard to declaim against our methods of scientific agriculture,  and resist all efforts at its introduction into their work. One of  them, when informed of the saving of time and labour that certain  implements would effect, answered with characteristic conservatism.  \"What,\" said he, \"would you have us do? Our only concern is to fill  our bellies, to get good clothes and houses, to say to one slave,  'Do this,' and to another, 'Do that,' and to sit idle ourselves and  be waited upon. As to our tillage, or building, or planting, our  forefathers did so and so and were satisfied, and why should not we  do the same? The English want us to use their ploughs instead of our  heavy wooden ones, and recommend other implements"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23748"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 3 (#7)"],[1," come from  Carrick-fergus, Ireland, two years before. He was without any education  worthy the name. As a boy, he went into the War for Independence, and  was for a time a British prisoner. He studied law in North Carolina,  moved west, and began legal practice at Nashville. He was one of the  framers of the Tennessee constitution in 1796. In 1797 he was a senator  from that State, and subsequently he was a judge on its supreme bench.  His exploits in the Creek War, the War of 1812, and the Seminole War are  already familiar. They had brought him so prominently and favorably  before the country that in 1824 his vote, both popular and electoral,  was larger than that of any other candidate. As we have seen, he himself  and multitudes throughout the country thought him wronged by the  election over him of John Quincy Adams. This contributed largely to his  popularity later, and in 1828 he was elected by a popular vote of  647,231, against 509,097 for Adams. Four years later he was reelected  against Clay by a still larger majority. Nor did his popularity to any  extent wane during his double administration, notwithstanding his many  violent and indiscreet acts as President.    [Illustration: Portrait.]  Andrew Jackson. From a photograph by Brady.      Much of Jackson's arbitrariness sprung from a foolish whim of his,  taking his election as equivalent to the enactment of all his peculiar  ideas into law. Ours is a government of the people, he said; the people  had spoken in his election, and had willed so and so. Woe to any senator  or representative who opposed! This was, of course, to mistake entirely  the nature of constitutional government.    After all, Jackson was by no means the ignorant and passionate old man,  controlled in everything by Van Buren, that many people, especially in  New England, have been accustomed to think him. Illiterate he certainly  was, though Adams exaggerated in calling him \"a barbarian who could not  write a sentence of grammar and could hardly spell his own name.\" He was  never popular in the federalist section of the Union. Yet with all his  mistakes and self-will, often inexcusable, he was one of the most  patriotic and clear-headed men who ever administered a government. If he  resorted to unheard-of methods within the law, very careful was he never  to transgress the law.    The most just criticism of Jackson in his time and later related to the  civil service. It was during his administration that the cry, \"turn the  rascals out,\" first arose, and it is well known that, adopting the  policy of New York and Pennsylvania politicians in vogue since 1800, he  made nearly a clean sweep of his political opponents from the offices at  his disposal. This was the more shameful from being so in contrast with  the policy of preceding presidents. Washington removed but two men from  office, one of these a defaulter; Adams ten, one of these also a  defaulter; Jefferson but thirty-nine; Madison five, three of them  defaulters; and Monroe nine. The younger Adams removed but two, both of  them for cause.    [1830]    Yet of Jackson's procedure in this matter it can be said, in partial  excuse, so bitter had been the opposition to him by officeholders as  well as others, that many removals were undoubtedly indispensable in  order to the efficiency of the public service. It is not at all  necessary for the rank and file of the civil service to be of the same  party with the Chief Magistrate, but it is necessary that they should  not be so utterly opposed to him as to feel bound in conscience to be  working for his defeat.    The fine art of party organization, semi-military in form, has come to  us from Jackson and his workers. Before his time, candidates for high  state offices had usually been nominated by legislative caucuses, and  those for national posts by congressional caucuses. State party  conventions had been held in Pennsylvania and New York. Soon after 1830  such a device for national nominations began to be thought of, and the  history of national party conventions may be said to begin with the  campaign of 1832.    [1832]    Jackson's dearest foe while in office was the United States Bank.  Magnifying the dishonesty which had, as everyone knew, disgraced its  management, he attacked it as a monster, an engine of the moneyed  classes for grinding the face of the poor. Like Jefferson, like Madison  at first, he disbelieved in its constitutionality. In his first message  and continually in his official utterances he inveighed against it as a  public danger, using its funds and patronage for party ends. This made  him unpopular with many who had been his friends, so that in the  campaign of 1832 Clay forced the bank question to the front as one on  which Jackson's attitude would greatly advantage the whig cause. He  accepted Clay's challenge with pleasure, and from this moment gave the  bank no quarter. We may call the contest of this year a pitched battle  between Jackson and the bank.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Roger B. Taney.      [1833]    In 1832 he vetoed a bill for a renewal of its charter, which was to  expire in 1836, and in 1833 he proceeded to break it by removing the  United States deposits which it held. Such removal was by law within the  power of the Secretary of the Treasury. Secretary McLane refused to  execute Jackson's will. He was removed and Duane appointed. Then Duane  was removed and Roger B. Taney appointed, who obeyed the President's  behest. The bank was emptied by checking out the public money as wanted,  at the same time depositing no more, the funds being instead placed in  \"pet\" state banks, as they were called because of the government favor  thus shown them.    The financial distress rightly or wrongly ascribed to this measure  throughout the country, instead of injuring Jackson, probably, on the  whole, made him still more popular, as showing the power of the bank.  When Congress met in 1833, the Senate passed a vote of censure upon him  for what he had done. Rancorous wranglings and debates pervaded Congress  and the whole land. After persistent effort by Jackson's bosom friend,  Senator Benton, of Missouri, this censure-vote was expunged by the  XXIVth Congress, second session, January 16, 1837. This was before  Jackson left office, and he accounted it the greatest triumph of his  public life.    [1830]      Jackson was somehow fortunate in dealing with foreign nations. It was he  who recovered for American ships that British West Indian trade which  had been so long denied. Negotiations were opened with Great Britain,  which, in 1830, had the result of placing American vessels in the  British West Indian ports at an equal advantage with British vessels  sailing thither from the United States--terms which, through the  contiguity of those islands to us, gave us a trade there better than  that of any other nation. This diplomacy brought the administration much  applause.    When Jackson became President, France was still in our debt on account  of her spoliations upon American commerce after the settlement of 1803.  The matter had been in negotiation ever since 1815, but hitherto in  vain. Jackson took it up with zeal, but with his usual apparent  recklessness. A treaty had been concluded in 1831, as a final settlement  between the two countries, binding France to pay twenty-five million  francs and the United States to pay one and one-half million. The first  instalment from France became due February 2, 1833, but was not paid.  Jackson's message to Congress in 1834, not an instalment having yet been  received, contained a distinct threat of war should not payment begin  forthwith. He also bade Edward Livingston, minister at Paris, in the  same contingency to demand his passports and leave Paris for London.    [1835]    Most public men, even those in his cabinet, thought this action  foolhardy and useless; but Quincy Adams, neither expecting nor receiving  any thanks for it, just as in the Seminole War difficulty, nobly stood  up for the President. A telling speech by him in the House led to its  unanimous resolution, March 2, 1835, that the execution of the treaty  should be insisted on. The French ministry blustered, and for a time  diplomatic relations between the two countries were entirely ruptured.  But France, affecting to see in the message of 1835, though voiced in  precisely the same tone as its predecessor, some apology for the menace  contained in that, began its payments. This money, as also all due from  the other states included in Napoleon's continental system, was paid  during Jackson's administration, a result which brought him and his  party great praise, not more for the money than for the respect and  consideration secured to the United States by insistence upon its  rights. The President's message to Congress in 1835 announced the entire  extinguishment of the public debt--the first and the last time this has  occurred in all our national history.    An important measure touching the hard-money system of our country was  passed in large part through the influence of President Jackson. By the  Mint Law of 1792 our silver dollar was made to contain three hundred and  seventy-one and a quarter grains of fine silver, or four hundred and  sixteen of standard silver. The amount of pure silver in this venerable  coin has remained unchanged ever since; only, in 1837, by a reduction of  the alloy fraction to exactly one-tenth, the total weight of the coin  became what it now is, four hundred and twelve and a half grains,  nine-tenths fine. The same law of 1792 had given the gold dollar just  one-fifteenth the weight of the silver dollar. This proportion, which  Hamilton had arrived at after careful investigation characteristic of  the man, was exactly correct at the time, but within a year, as is now  known, on account of increase in the relative value of gold, the gold  dollar at fifteen to one became more valuable than its"]]]
