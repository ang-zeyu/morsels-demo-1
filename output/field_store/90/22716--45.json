Nat Jackson became his chum and the two  lads were almost inseparable; they lunched together, played on the ball  team, and often spent their Saturday afternoons in taking long walks or  going to Nat's house. Peter, however, took great good care that Nat  should not visit him.    The omission of this hospitality was not entirely unnoticed by young  Jackson, and the conclusion he drew was that Peter lived humbly--perhaps  poorly--in lodgings to which he did not consider it suitable to invite a  guest. Nat thought this foolish pride on Peter's part and he meant to  tell him so some time when they became better acquainted. It was a  mistake, argued Nat, to be over-sensitive about one's poverty. If Peter  was saving his money surely that was excuse enough. He had a right to  live as he pleased. Furthermore what possible difference could it make  in their friendship? Nat himself lived simply but very nicely on the  meager salary that he earned. He and his mother rented two tiny  bedrooms, a sunny little living-room, and a microscopic kitchen in a  part of the town which, to be sure, was cheap and ugly; but Mrs.  Jackson, Peter soon found, was one of the rare women who could make a  home--a real home--almost anywhere. She often laughingly remarked that  if she were to dwell in a snow hovel at the North Pole she believed she  should cut a window in the side of it and set a pot of flowers there,  and Peter could well imagine her doing it.    She was a short, bright-eyed, motherly little person, with a quick  appreciation of a joke, and a wonderful knack at cooking. Incidentally  she had a quiet voice and chose soft colors in preference to crude ones.  Peter gathered from her manner of speech and from the delicate modeling  of her hands that at some time in her life she had occupied a very  different position from the one she was now filling. But whatever that  past might have been he gained no inkling of it either from her or from  her son. Bravely, patiently, happily, she made a home for her boy--such  a home that Peter Coddington visited it with the keenest pleasure and  came away with a vague wonder what it was that those three wee rooms  possessed which was lacking in his own richly furnished mansion.    Perhaps if it had not been for the encouragement of Nat and his mother  Peter might not have had the grit to master his work at the beamhouse.  A wholesome spur these two friends were to his flagging spirits. There  was some subtle quality in Nat's mother that made a fellow want to do  his very best--to be as much of a man as he could. And yet she said  little to urge either of the lads to their task. It was just that she  was so proud and so pleased when they did win any good fortune through  their own endeavors. And so Peter forged bravely on, prodded by an  unformulated desire to do well not only for the sake of his own parents,  but that he might not disappoint the faith that Nat and Nat's mother had  in him.    Even Mr. Coddington remarked one evening at dinner (and there was a  twinkle in his eye when he said it) that he was highly gratified by the  reports he heard of \"young Strong.\"    But as the summer advanced and the days grew hotter Mrs. Coddington  watched her boy with anxious care and dropped more than one suggestion  that it was time they all were off to the shore. None of her suggestions  bore fruit, however, and by and by when she saw that Mr. Coddington had  no intention of leaving Milburn she ceased to remonstrate further and  Peter settled down to work and to keep as comfortable as he could during  the hot weather. What a haven his home, with its green lawns and wide  verandas, became, after those long, breathless hours in the tannery!  Never before had he half appreciated his surroundings. Most of the  houses where the men at the factory lived were huddled closely in that  dingy part of the town where Nat Jackson's rooms were, and Peter soon  discovered that after supper many of the workmen and their families came  and sat in the ball field opposite Factory 1 where there was more air,  and where some of the men actually slept when the nights were very hot.  It was a blessing--that great open space! Peter wondered what they would  have done without it.    He had been raising the query mentally one July morning on his way to  work after a close, restless night in his big room on the hill. The day  was a sultry one; no air stirred, and it was with a sigh that Peter  entered the beamhouse. No sooner was he inside, however, than he at once  saw that something was wrong. Knots of men were speaking together in  undertones and seemed to be far more eager to talk than to take up their  daily tasks. Only Bryant, who moved from one group to another, urging,  coaxing, commanding, succeeded in compelling them to attend to what they  had to do.    \"You fellows can do all the talking you want to at noon,\" he said.  \"There will be no builders around to-day, I guess.\"    \"They'll do well to keep away!\" muttered an angry Swede, threateningly.    \"You go to unhairing skins, Olsen,\" Bryant commanded, putting his hand  firmly but kindly on the broad shoulder of the man. \"You can scold your  wrath all out this noon. Go on.\"    Sullenly the man obeyed.    \"What is the matter?\" Peter managed to whisper to Nat Jackson.    \"The men are furious; they are threatening to strike,\" returned Nat in  an undertone.    \"To strike!\" exclaimed Peter. His thoughts flew to his father. \"What has  happened?\" he questioned insistently.    \"Didn't you see last night's paper? Haven't you heard? Mr. Coddington is  going to put up another tannery. He's going to build it on the ball  field!\"    \"On the ball field! Our field!\"    \"So the paper says. Of course the land is his. But it does seem pretty  tough!\"    Peter moved on, dazed.    To take away the field--the one out-of-door spot for luncheon and  exercise! To deprive hundreds of stifled creatures of fresh air and  sunlight! It was monstrous! Why hadn't his father mentioned the plan? Of  course he did not realize what it would mean to the men or he never  would have considered it. What would become of all those tired people  who nightly left their bare little dwellings and sought a cool evening  breeze in the field? Peter knew Nat and his mother always sat there  until bedtime and many of the other workmen brought their wives and  children. Once the boy had sat there himself. It was an orderly crowd  that he had seen--children tumbling over each other on the grass; women  seated on the benches and exchanging a bit of gossip; tired men  stretched full-length on the turf resting in the quiet of the place.    Why, it was a crime to take the field away!    All the morning while he worked Peter's mind seethed with arguments  against the building of the new factory. He longed to see his father  and talk it out. Surely Mr. Coddington would listen if he realized the  conditions. He was a kind man--not an inhuman brute. It seemed as if the  noon whistle would never blow.    With Nat Jackson and a score of agitated workmen Peter went out into the  shade opposite. Luncheon was forgotten, and ball, too. Instead a crowd  gathered and on every hand there were mutterings and angry protests.    \"Of course Coddington can take the land. It's his. There is no law to  prevent him from doing anything he wants to with it. What does he care  for us?\" remarked an old, gray-haired tanner.    \"The working man is nothing to the rich man,\" grumbled another. \"All the  millionaire wants is more money. Another factory means just that--more  money! It's money, money, money--always money with the rich. The more  they have the more they want.\"    Sick at heart, Peter listened.    \"Why don't you fellows do something about it?\" blustered a red-faced  Italian. \"I'll bet you if we called a strike it would bring Coddington  to terms. He'd a good sight rather give up building that factory than  have us all walk out--'specially now when there's more work ahead than  the firm can handle. I've been in five strikes in other places and we  never failed yet to get what we started for.\"    \"Do you think you could drive a man like Mr. Coddington that way?\" It  was Carmachel who spoke. \"You can walk out, all of you, if you choose.  It would make no difference to him. If he has decided it is best to put  up that tannery he'll put it up. A strike would do you no good and as a  result your families would be without food and a roof over their heads  all winter. You're a fine man, Ristori! Coddington pays you well. You  take his money and are glad to get a job from him; then the first  minute anything does not go to suit you you turn against him and cry:  Strike! You don't know what loyalty means. Hasn't Coddington always been  square with you? Hasn't he paid you good wages? Hasn't he added an extra  bit to your envelope at Christmas? I'll not strike!\"    \"What would you have us do?\" was Ristori's hot retort. \"Would you have  us sit by like dumb things and let him do anything to us he pleases?\"    \"Coddington is a reasonable man,\" Carmachel replied. \"Why don't some of  you talk decently with him about all this?\"    \"Aye! And lose our jobs for our pains!\" sneered a swarthy Armenian.    A shout went up.    \"A strike! A strike!\" yelled a hundred voices.    \"Would you strike and see your families starve?\" cried Nat Jackson. \"I  have a mother to support. I care more for her than for the field and  everything on it. I shall not strike.\"    \"You white-livered young idiot!\" roared some one in the crowd.    \"I tell you, men,\" went on Carmachel, \"there is nothing to be gained by  striking. Get together some of your best speakers from each factory and  let them ask an interview of Mr. Coddington--now--this afternoon--before  anything more is done about the new factory.\"    \"He'll not grant it!\"    \"Hasn't he always been fair with you?\"    \"Yes!\"    \"Aye!\"    \"So he has!\"    \"He has that!\"    Grudgingly the workmen admitted it, even the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25828"],[0,"History of Australia and New Zealand (#7)"],[1,"ardent  spirits began to be the chief article of traffic. It was found that  nothing sold so well among the convicts as rum, their favourite liquor;  and, rather than not make money, the officers began to import large  quantities of that spirit, thus deliberately assisting to demoralise  still further the degraded population which they had been sent to  reform. So enormous were the profits made in this debasing trade that  very few of the officers could refrain from joining it. Soon the New  South Wales Corps became like one great firm of spirit merchants,  engaged in the importing and retailing of rum. The most enterprising  went so far as to introduce stills and commence the manufacture of  spirits in the colony. By an order of the Governor in Council this was  forbidden, but many continued to work their stills in secret. This  system of traffic, demoralising to every one engaged in it, was shared  even by the highest officials in the colony. In the year 1800 the chief  constable was a publican, and the head gaoler sold rum and brandy  opposite the prison gates.      #3. State of the Colony.#--Under these circumstances, drunkenness  became fearfully prevalent; the freed convicts gave themselves up to  unrestrained riot, and, when intoxicated, committed the most brutal  atrocities; the soldiers also sank into the wildest dissipation; and  many of the officers themselves led lives of open and shameless  debauchery. This was the community Governor King had to rule. He made an  effort to effect some change, but failed; and we can hardly wonder at  the feeling of intense disgust which he entertained and freely  expressed.      #4. Mutiny of Convicts.#--Most of the convicts, on their arrival in  the colony, were \"assigned\"--that is, sent to work as shepherds or  farm-labourers for the free settlers in the country; but prisoners of  the worst class were chained in gangs and employed on the roads, or on  the Government farms. One of these gangs, consisting of three or four  hundred convicts, was stationed at Castlehill, a few miles north of  Parramatta. The prisoners, emboldened by their numbers and inflamed by  the oratory of a number of political exiles, broke out into open  insurrection. They flung away their hoes and spades, removed their  irons, seized about two hundred and fifty muskets, and marched towards  the Hawkesbury, expecting to be there reinforced by so many additional  convicts that they would be able to overpower the military. Major  Johnstone, with twenty-four soldiers of the New South Wales Corps,  pursued them; they halted and turned round to fight, but he charged with  so much determination into their midst that they were quickly routed,  and fled in all directions, leaving several of their number dead on the  spot. Three or four of the ringleaders were caught and hanged; the  remainder returned quickly to their duty.      #5. Origin of Wool-growing.#--During Governor King's term of office a  beginning was made in what is now an industry of momentous importance to  Australia. In the New South Wales Corps there had been an officer named  Macarthur, who had become so disgusted with the service that, shortly  after his arrival in Sydney, he resigned his commission, and, having  obtained a grant of land, became a settler in the country. He quickly  perceived that wool-growing, if properly carried on, would be a source  of much wealth, and obtained a number of sheep from the Dutch colony at  the Cape of Good Hope, with which to make a commencement. These were of  a kind which did not suit the climate, and his first attempt failed; but  in 1803, when he was in England on a visit, he spoke so highly of New  South Wales as a country adapted for wool-growing, that King George III.  was interested in the proposal, and offered his assistance. Now, the  sheep most suitable for Macarthur's purpose were the merino sheep of  Spain; but these were not to be obtained, as the Spaniards, desirous of  keeping the lucrative trade of wool-growing to themselves, had made it a  capital crime to export sheep of this kind from Spain. But it so  happened that, as a special favour, a few had been given to King George,  who was an enthusiastic farmer; and when he heard of Macarthur's idea,  he sent him one or two from his own flock to be carried out to New South  Wales. They were safely landed at Sydney, Governor King made a grant of  ten thousand acres to Mr. Macarthur, at Camden, and the experiment was  begun. It was not long before the most marked success crowned the  effort, and in the course of a few years the meadows at Camden were  covered with great flocks of sheep, whose wool yielded annually a  handsome fortune to their enterprising owner.      #6. Governor Bligh.#--In 1806 Governor King was succeeded by Captain  Bligh, whose previous adventures have made his name so well known. In  his ship, the _Bounty_, he had been sent by the British Government to  the South Sea Islands for a cargo of bread-fruit trees. But his conduct  to his sailors was so tyrannical that they mutinied, put him, along with  eighteen others, into an open boat, then sailed away, and left him in  the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Bligh was a skilful sailor, and the  voyage he thereupon undertook is one of the most remarkable on record.  In an open boat he carried his little party over 3,500 miles of unknown  ocean to the island of Timor, where they found a vessel that took them  home.    In appointing Captain Bligh to rule the colony, the English Government  spoiled an excellent seaman to make a very inefficient Governor. It was  true that New South Wales contained a large convict population, who  required to be ruled with despotic rigour; yet there were many free  settlers who declined to be treated like slaves and felons, and who soon  came to have a thorough dislike to the new Governor. Not that he was  without kindly feeling; his generous treatment of the Hawkesbury  farmers, who were ruined by a flood in 1806, showed him to have been  warm-hearted in his way; he exerted himself to the utmost, both with  time and money, to alleviate their distress, and received the special  thanks of the English Government for his humanity. And yet his arbitrary  and unamiable manners completely obscured all these better qualities. He  caused the convicts to be flogged without mercy for faults which existed  only in his own imagination; he bullied his officers, and, throughout  the colony, repeated the same mistakes which had led to the mutiny of  the _Bounty_. At the same time, he was anxious to do what he conceived  to be his duty to his superiors in England. He had been ordered to put a  stop to the traffic in spirits, and, in spite of the most unscrupulous  opposition on the part of those whose greed was interested, he set  himself to effect this reform by prompt and summary measures, and with a  contemptuous disregard of the hatred he was causing; but, in the end,  the officers were too strong for him, and in the quarrel that ensued the  Governor was completely defeated.      #7. Expulsion of Bligh.#--Month after month Bligh became more and more  unpopular; those whom he did not alienate in the course of his duty he  offended by his rudeness, until, at last, there was scarcely any one in  the colony who was his friend. Many were inflamed by so bitter a hatred  that they were ready to do anything for revenge, and affairs seemed to  be in that critical state in which a trifling incident may bring about  serious results.    This determining cause was supplied by a quarrel which took place  between Mr. Macarthur and Mr. Atkin, the new judge-advocate of the  colony. Mr. Macarthur was condemned to pay a heavy fine for neglect, in  having permitted a convict to escape in a vessel of which he was partly  the owner. He refused to pay, and was summoned before the court, of  which Atkin was the president. He declined to appear, on the ground that  Atkin was his personal enemy. Thereupon Atkin caused him to be seized  and put in gaol. Bligh appointed a special court to try him, consisting  of six officers, together with Atkin himself. Macarthur was brought  before it, but protested against being judged by his enemy, stating his  willingness, however, to abide by the decision of the six officers. The  officers supported his protest, and the trial was discontinued. Bligh  was exceedingly angry, and, by declaring he would put the six officers  in gaol, brought matters to a crisis. The officers of the New South  Wales Corps all took part with their comrades; they assisted Mr.  Macarthur to get up a petition, asking Major Johnstone, the military  commander, to depose Governor Bligh, and himself take charge of the  colony. Major Johnstone was only too glad of the opportunity. He held a  council of officers, at which Mr. Macarthur and several others were  present. Their course of action was decided upon, and next morning the  soldiers marched, with colours flying and drums beating, to the gate of  the Governor's house. Here they were met by Bligh's daughter, who  endeavoured to persuade them to retire; but they made her stand aside  and marched up the avenue. Meantime the Governor had hidden himself in  the house; the soldiers entered and searched everywhere for him, till at  length they discovered him behind a bed, where he was seeking to hide  important papers. He was arrested, and sentinels were posted to prevent  his escape. Major Johnstone assumed the Governor's position, and  appointed his friends to the most important offices in the Government  service. He continued to direct affairs for some time, until Colonel  Foveaux superseded him. Foveaux, in his turn, was superseded by Colonel  Patterson, who came over from Tasmania to take charge of the colony  until a new Governor should be sent out from home. Patterson offered  Bligh his liberty if he would promise to go straight to England, and not  seek to raise a disturbance in the colony. This promise was given"]]]
