CARDINAL.             I 'll leave you.      FERDINAND.                              Nay, I have done.    I am confident, had I been damn'd in hell,    And should have heard of this, it would have put me    Into a cold sweat.  In, in; I 'll go sleep.    Till I know who [loves] my sister, I 'll not stir:    That known, I 'll find scorpions to string my whips,    And fix her in a general eclipse.         Exeunt.               Act III             Scene I[72]           [Enter] ANTONIO and DELIO      ANTONIO.  Our noble friend, my most beloved Delio!    O, you have been a stranger long at court:    Came you along with the Lord Ferdinand?      DELIO.  I did, sir:  and how fares your noble duchess?      ANTONIO.  Right fortunately well:  she 's an excellent    Feeder of pedigrees; since you last saw her,    She hath had two children more, a son and daughter.      DELIO.  Methinks 'twas yesterday.  Let me but wink,    And not behold your face, which to mine eye    Is somewhat leaner, verily I should dream    It were within this half hour.      ANTONIO.  You have not been in law, friend Delio,    Nor in prison, nor a suitor at the court,    Nor begg'd the reversion of some great man's place,    Nor troubled with an old wife, which doth make    Your time so insensibly hasten.      DELIO.                           Pray, sir, tell me,    Hath not this news arriv'd yet to the ear    Of the lord cardinal?      ANTONIO.               I fear it hath:    The Lord Ferdinand, that 's newly come to court,    Doth bear himself right dangerously.      DELIO.                                Pray, why?      ANTONIO.  He is so quiet that he seems to sleep    The tempest out, as dormice do in winter.    Those houses that are haunted are most still    Till the devil be up.      DELIO.                 What say the common people?      ANTONIO.  The common rabble do directly say    She is a strumpet.      DELIO.              And your graver heads    Which would be politic, what censure they?      ANTONIO.  They do observe I grow to infinite purchase,[73]    The left hand way; and all suppose the duchess    Would amend it, if she could; for, say they,    Great princes, though they grudge their officers    Should have such large and unconfined means    To get wealth under them, will not complain,    Lest thereby they should make them odious    Unto the people.  For other obligation    Of love or marriage between her and me    They never dream of.      DELIO.                The Lord Ferdinand    Is going to bed.           [Enter DUCHESS, FERDINAND, and Attendants]      FERDINAND.        I 'll instantly to bed,    For I am weary.--I am to bespeak    A husband for you.      DUCHESS.            For me, sir!  Pray, who is 't?      FERDINAND.  The great Count Malatesti.      DUCHESS.                                Fie upon him!    A count!  He 's a mere stick of sugar-candy;    You may look quite through him.  When I choose    A husband, I will marry for your honour.      FERDINAND.  You shall do well in 't.--How is 't, worthy Antonio?      DUCHESS.  But, sir, I am to have private conference with you    About a scandalous report is spread    Touching mine honour.      FERDINAND.             Let me be ever deaf to 't:    One of Pasquil's paper-bullets,[74] court-calumny,    A pestilent air, which princes' palaces    Are seldom purg'd of.  Yet, say that it were true,    I pour it in your bosom, my fix'd love    Would strongly excuse, extenuate, nay, deny    Faults, were they apparent in you.  Go, be safe    In your own innocency.      DUCHESS.  [Aside.]      O bless'd comfort!    This deadly air is purg'd.         Exeunt [DUCHESS, ANTONIO, DELIO, and Attendants.]      FERDINAND.                  Her guilt treads on    Hot-burning coulters.[75]         Enter BOSOLA                           Now, Bosola,    How thrives our intelligence?[76]      BOSOLA.                        Sir, uncertainly:    'Tis rumour'd she hath had three bastards, but    By whom we may go read i' the stars.      FERDINAND.                            Why, some    Hold opinion all things are written there.      BOSOLA.  Yes, if we could find spectacles to read them.    I do suspect there hath been some sorcery    Us'd on the duchess.      FERDINAND.            Sorcery! to what purpose?      BOSOLA.  To make her dote on some desertless fellow    She shames to acknowledge.      FERDINAND.                  Can your faith give way    To think there 's power in potions or in charms,    To make us love whether we will or no?      BOSOLA.  Most certainly.      FERDINAND.  Away! these are mere gulleries,[77] horrid things,    Invented by some cheating mountebanks    To abuse us.  Do you think that herbs or charms    Can force the will?  Some trials have been made    In this foolish practice, but the ingredients    Were lenitive[78] poisons, such as are of force    To make the patient mad; and straight the witch    Swears by equivocation they are in love.    The witch-craft lies in her rank blood.  This night    I will force confession from her.  You told me    You had got, within these two days, a false key    Into her bed-chamber.      BOSOLA.                I have.      FERDINAND.                      As I would wish.      BOSOLA.  What do you intend to do?      FERDINAND.                          Can you guess?      BOSOLA.                                             No.      FERDINAND.  Do not ask, then:    He that can compass me, and know my drifts,    May say he hath put a girdle 'bout the world,    And sounded all her quick-sands.      BOSOLA.                           I do not    Think so.      FERDINAND.  What do you think, then, pray?      BOSOLA.                                     That you    Are your own chronicle too much, and grossly    Flatter yourself.      FERDINAND.         Give me thy hand; I thank thee:    I never gave pension but to flatterers,    Till I entertained thee.  Farewell.    That friend a great man's ruin strongly checks,    Who rails into his belief all his defects.         Exeunt.             Scene II[79]           [Enter] DUCHESS, ANTONIO, and CARIOLA      DUCHESS.  Bring me the casket hither, and the glass.--    You get no lodging here to-night, my lord.      ANTONIO.  Indeed, I must persuade one.      DUCHESS.                                Very good:    I hope in time 'twill grow into a custom,    That noblemen shall come with cap and knee    To purchase a night's lodging of their wives.      ANTONIO.  I must lie here.      DUCHESS.                    Must!  You are a lord of mis-rule.      ANTONIO.  Indeed, my rule is only in the night.      DUCHESS.  I 'll stop your mouth.         [Kisses him.]      ANTONIO.  Nay, that 's but one; Venus had two soft doves    To draw her chariot; I must have another.--         [She kisses him again.]    When wilt thou marry, Cariola?      CARIOLA.                        Never, my lord.      ANTONIO.  O, fie upon this single life! forgo it.    We read how Daphne, for her peevish [flight,][80]    Became a fruitless bay-tree; Syrinx turn'd    To the pale empty reed; Anaxarete    Was frozen into marble:  whereas those    Which married, or prov'd kind unto their friends,    Were by a gracious influence transhap'd    Into the olive, pomegranate, mulberry,    Became flowers, precious stones, or eminent stars.      CARIOLA.  This is a vain poetry:  but I pray you, tell me,    If there were propos'd me, wisdom, riches, and beauty,    In three several young men, which should I choose?      ANTONIO.  'Tis a hard question.  This was Paris' case,    And he was blind in 't, and there was a great cause;    For how was 't possible he could judge right,    Having three amorous goddesses in view,    And they stark naked?  'Twas a motion    Were able to benight the apprehension    Of the severest counsellor of Europe.    Now I look on both your faces so well form'd,    It puts me in mind of a question I would ask.      CARIOLA.  What is 't?      ANTONIO.               I do wonder why hard-favour'd ladies,    For the most part, keep worse-favour'd waiting-women    To attend them, and cannot endure fair ones.      DUCHESS.  O, that 's soon answer'd.    Did you ever in your life know an ill painter    Desire to have his dwelling next door to the shop    Of an excellent picture-maker?  'Twould disgrace    His face-making, and undo him.  I prithee,    When were we so merry?--My hair tangles.      ANTONIO.  Pray thee, Cariola, let 's steal forth the room,    And let her talk to herself:  I have divers times    Serv'd her the like, when she hath chaf'd extremely.    I love to see her angry.  Softly, Cariola.         Exeunt [ANTONIO and CARIOLA.]      DUCHESS.  Doth not the colour of my hair 'gin to change?    When I wax gray, I shall have all the court    Powder their hair with arras,[81] to be like me.    You have cause to love me; I ent'red you into my heart         [Enter FERDINAND unseen]    Before you would vouchsafe to call for the keys.    We shall one day have my brothers take you napping.    Methinks his presence, being now in court,    Should make you keep your own bed; but you 'll say    Love mix'd with fear is sweetest.  I 'll assure you,    You shall get no more children till my brothers    Consent to be your gossips.  Have you lost your tongue?    'Tis welcome:    For know, whether I am doom'd to live or die,    I can do both like a prince.      FERDINAND.                    Die, then, quickly!         Giving her a poniard.    Virtue, where art thou hid?  What hideous thing    Is it that doth eclipse thee?      DUCHESS.                       Pray, sir, hear me.      FERDINAND.  Or is it true thou art but a bare name,    And no essential thing?      DUCHESS.                 Sir----      FERDINAND.                     "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22323"],[0,"Impressions of South Africa (#7)"],[1,"end, and arrangements have to  be made for the resettlement of the country. Those who have read the  historical chapters of this book, and have reflected on the history of  other British colonies, and particularly of Canada, will have drawn the  moral, which I have sought to enforce in the concluding chapter, that  what South Africa most needs is the reconcilement and ultimate fusion of  the two white races. Reconcilement and fusion have now, to all  appearances, been thrown back into a dim and distant future. That man  must be sanguine indeed who expects, as some persons say they do expect,  to see the relations of the two races placed on a better footing by a  bitter war between them, a war which has many of the incidents of a  civil war, and is waged on one side by citizen soldiers. To most  observers it seems more likely to sow a crop of dragon's teeth which  will produce a harvest, if not of armed men, yet of permanent hatred and  disaffection. Nevertheless, even at the darkest moment, men must work  with hope for the future, and strive to apply the principles of policy  which experience has approved. The first principle which governs the  relation of Britain to her self-governing colonies is that she must do  all she can to keep them contented and loyal. She cannot hope  permanently to retain any which have become disloyal, and the defection  of one may be the signal for the loosening of the tie which binds the  others. The gift of self-government practically makes the maintenance of  the Imperial connection dependent on the will of the colony; and where  self-government exists, voting is more powerful than arms. The Transvaal  Republic has been often troublesome, but an unfriendly neighbour is less  dangerous than a disaffected colony. A wise policy will therefore use  with moderation the opportunities which the conclusion of the present  war will afford for resettling the political arrangements of the  country, remembering that the Dutch and British races have got to live  together, looking forward to a time, probably less than a century  distant, when the exhaustion of mineral wealth will have made South  Africa again a pastoral and agricultural country, and thereby increased  the importance, relatively to the town-dwelling English, of that Dutch  element which is so deeply rooted in the soil. To reconcile the races by  employing all the natural and human forces which make for peace and  render the prosperity of each the prosperity of both, and so to pave the  way for the ultimate fusion of Dutchman and Englishman in a common  Imperial as well as a common Africander patriotism--this should be the  aim of every government that seeks to base the world-wide greatness of  Britain on the deepest and surest foundations.    _October 23rd, 1899._    [Footnote 1: Whatever may be thought as to the much controverted Edgar  case, the fact that such special stress has been laid on it, and that  few, if any, other cases have been instanced in which crimes against  Uitlanders went unpunished, goes to show that life was exposed only to  those dangers which threaten it in all new mining communities.]    [Footnote 2: The language of the English newspapers in Cape Colony, and  of some in London, did as much to strengthen this belief as the language  of the Transvaal papers did to inflame minds there. Seldom has the press  done more to destroy the prospects of peace.]          NOTE      I have to thank Sir Donald Currie and Messrs. A.S. and G.G. Brown for  the permission kindly given me to use the maps in the excellent \"Guide  to South Africa\" (published by the Castle Mail Packets Company) in the  preparation of the three maps contained in this volume; and I trust that  these maps will prove helpful to the reader, for a comprehension of the  physical geography of the country is essential to a comprehension of its  history.    The friends in South Africa to whom I am indebted for many of the facts  I have stated and views I have expressed are too numerous to mention:  but I cannot deny myself the pleasure of returning thanks for the genial  hospitality and unfailing kindness which I received in every part of the  country.    _September 13th, 1897._          MAPS AT END OF VOLUME      POLITICAL MAP OF SOUTH AFRICA.
