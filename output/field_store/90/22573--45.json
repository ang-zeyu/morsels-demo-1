[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22285"],[0,"An American Suffragette (#7)"],[1," well for me to get a nurse to assist in taking the  little one home? I can 'phone when I return these instruments.\"    \"Your machine is coming back, isn't it?\" Miss Holland answered. \"It  seems to me that with what help her mother and I can render that we  shall manage.\"    \"Excellently,\" he said. \"Then you will be on guard until my return; see  that the child is not disturbed. I shall be gone but a few minutes.\"    He readjusted his attire, and taking up his hat strode out of the  building, unconscious until he reached the door that half a dozen  energetic reporters were eagerly asking particulars. Finding him  unwilling to tell them anything more than the vaguest generalities, the  more resourceful returned to the improvised operating-room, and before  Silvia Holland knew it they had the story from her enthusiastic lips,  supplemented by a few facts gathered from the woman. For thus are  first-page sensations secured and created.    Silvia noticed that the woman spoke with visible reluctance, and she  herself passed over the controversy between Dr. Morris and Dr. Earl,  anxious to spare her friend any unnecessary annoyance.    \"I am sorry, Mrs. Bell,\" she said contritely. \"I didn't realize at first  that we were being interviewed.\"    \"Oh, there is no harm done,\" the woman said quietly. \"I hope the doctor  will not mind; won't he be back pretty soon?\"    Almost as she spoke, his tall form was seen making its way through the  besieging ranks of the Fourth Estate. He waved them aside good  humoredly, but refusing to be interviewed, he took the child in his  strong arms and, followed by her mother and Miss Holland, made his way  to the auto. While she was in a profound sleep when he returned, she  wakened instantly when he commanded her to do so, and the cool night air  evidently refreshed her greatly as they drove to Mrs. Bell's home. Dr.  Earl carried the little one upstairs, gave her mother explicit  directions, and promising to call early the following day to adjust a  cast, left the apartment with Miss Holland.          CHAPTER VI    SOME STRENUOUS ANTI-SUFFRAGISTS      Several of the New York papers carried lurid headlines and more or less  sensational accounts of the accident to the child and the treatment  administered by Dr. Earl, as well as a tribute to the heroism of the  volunteer nurse. All of them contained a report of some character of  these occurrences.    When Dr. Earl called at the home of his fiancee, according to  appointment, to take her and her mother to luncheon the next day, he  found Leonora in a sullen mood, and it did not take him long to discover  that he was not in high favor at this particular hour.    He greeted her with a kiss, but hers in return was perfunctory. He was  not compelled to wait long for an explanation, for she poured out her  feelings without any questioning.    \"Oh, Jack, dear, how could you mix up with that suffrage crowd! Don't  you know that mamma is vice-president of the Anti-Woman Suffrage  League? She is so annoyed! And that horrid Silvia Holland--why, Jack,  she is a downright socialist. Don't you know she was arrested in England  for trying to break into parliament with a lot of other suffragettes,  and she was arrested here only last month for defying the police and  taking sides with a lot of girls who refused to work in the factories  where they were employed! Even when in school she was horrid. When they  wouldn't let her make a suffrage speech on the school grounds one night  she took the girls to a neighboring graveyard and spoke from a flat  monument! And to think the papers have you mixed up with her, and our  wedding soon to be announced! Oh, it's terrible!\" and she buried her  face in the sofa pillows.    Had this scene occurred with any one else, Jack felt certain he could  not have restrained his laughter, for he could see Miss Holland  delivering an exhortation to the schoolgirls from a tombstone in a  cemetery by night. But he understood the prejudices of a certain element  of New York society, and while the past twenty-four hours had led him,  somewhat, to believe that this progressive democratic wave sweeping  over the world had engulfed all New Yorkers, he now realized how sadly  mistaken he had been.    With infinite tact he told her that his sister had taken their party to  the ball--pointed out his own duty when the injured child had been  brought in from the street, and how he had not even suggested that Miss  Holland should assist him. He saw that the present was no time for a  discussion of the merits of the case or a pronouncement of his own  views, but he distinctly realized, with something of a jolt, it is true,  that a wide gulf separated the Bourbon element of America's supposed  democracy from the advancing column of her real and inspired democracy,  and he wondered whether it were at all possible to tunnel under or  bridge over this gulf. He lightly changed the subject.    \"I have just discovered that I can get my old offices on East 53rd  Street, as the year's lease expires the first of next month, and the  agents heeded my letter asking them to wait for me. So I shall feel  quite at home in the old quarters,\" he said.    She smiled at this, but was not quite ready to drop the former subject.  \"Jack, dear, did you take Miss Holland home at one o'clock in the  morning?\"    He laughed at her this time, as he bent to kiss her. \"I really believe  you are jealous, you little nymph. Of course I took her home. She could  not stay there all night, and there was no one else to take her.\"    She looked very serious. \"No, I don't know what jealousy is,\" she slowly  and emphatically said, \"but I don't want to know people who do the  things that Miss Holland does, and I don't want you to know them.\"    \"My dear child,\" he said, taking her hands in his and catching her eyes  with his own steady glance. \"I must know whoever is thrown into my path  either in a professional or a social way. All people are intensely  interesting to me, for we are, after all, but one great family of human  beings, trying to carve out lives that are worth while, and this we can  do better by getting the best there is from each other.\" He hesitated a  moment, still looking steadily at her. She quivered slightly, but he was  dimly conscious of the colossal character of the will she was summoning  to her aid. Then very slowly, but with all the earnestness of his  nature, he added, \"You must get away from these views, for they are  dwarfing and not becoming to you, and if you do not we shall be very  unhappy. Miss Holland is a remarkable young woman. She is destined to  fill a great place in our American social and political life. She is  well worthy of your friendship.\"    She withdrew her hands, but still kept her eyes fixed on his. Her brow  contracted and with emphasis she said: \"Miss Holland has forfeited her  place in our set by her conduct; why, Jack, you don't know how she is  criticized by our friends or you would not suggest such a thing.\"    He arose with a shrug of his shoulders. Fortunately, Mrs. Kimball  appeared at this moment and they motored to the Plaza for luncheon,  which was a somewhat formal and unsatisfactory affair, in spite of all  his efforts to make it otherwise. The young man could not but feel that  Mrs. Kimball shared her daughter's views--was, in fact, their  author--and that in the eyes of his future mother-in-law he had been  guilty of a breach of etiquette far more serious than an infraction of  the moral law. He left them with the understanding that he would  accompany them to the theatre in the evening.          CHAPTER VII    CHRISTIAN SCIENCE AND SURGERY      The days of a militant suffragette are full to overflowing, and Silvia  Holland was not able to see Mrs. Bell and her little daughter early the  following morning as she had planned. It must have been well toward the  middle of the afternoon when she entered the modest apartment, and going  to the bed, visible in the alcove, kissed the child and put a great,  dewy bunch of violets in her hand. She took them, and hugged them tight  in her thin little arms, while her eyes looked into Silvia's  wonderingly, and her mother turned away to hide the sudden tears.    The apartment was well though not expensively furnished, and both mother  and child had the unmistakable air of good birth and refinement. As  Silvia glanced at Mrs. Bell she was conscious of something in her face  at once baffling and appealing. She had the indefinable look of one who  dwells with a sorrow for which there is no cure.    \"Are you quite sure there is nothing I can do for either of you to-day?\"  Silvia asked, a trifle diffidently, for she did not want to offend by  overzeal.    \"You and Dr. Earl have placed us under so many obligations that we can  never hope to repay them,\" Mrs. Bell said quietly. \"If I do not speak  more freely of what I feel, it is because I have no words for its  expression.\"    \"Don't speak or think of obligations,\" Silvia said lightly, \"and here is  my card, so that if at any time I might be of service to you I hope you  will not hesitate to call on me. I live at the Whittier Studios.\" The  card which she gave Mrs. Bell read:                                SILVIA HOLLAND,                      Attorney and Counsellor-at-Law,                          City Investment Building,                              New York City.    Mrs. Bell looked at it curiously. \"Oh, it isn't possible that you are  _that_ Miss Holland, _the_ Miss Holland!\" she said incredulously.    Silvia laughed. \"Don't I look as if I could say 'Gentlemen of the jury'  with sufficient gravity?\" she said. \"Probably I shall do better when we  say 'Ladies of the jury,' too.\"    \"You look like what you are, a beautiful and fashionable lady,\" Mrs.  Bell answered. \"Surely no one would ever take you for a professional  woman.\"    \"Must a fashionable lady be a listless parasite? Even if she wishes  merely to be a queen of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22288"],[0,"Chinese Painters: A Critical Study (#7)"],[1," Among the heads of schools cited in the Chinese writings Ma Yuean and Hsia  Kuei of the Sung dynasty must be placed in a class by themselves. Both of  these masters lived at the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the  thirteenth centuries. Their style can be described with accuracy since  original examples are extant--both by themselves and by their  disciples--in which their characteristics are fully revealed.    Ma Yuean is classed with the Southern School by reason of his restraint in  the use of color, his greatness of conception and his technical treatment  of forms. But he brings to his work a virility in which the influence of  the Northern School is plainly discerned. He has a broad stroke and a  masterful manner which place his works in the front rank of all Chinese  painting. His mountainous backgrounds rear themselves with fierce energy.  His old pines, with branches wreathed in vines, would suffice alone to  define his style, so freely do they express the force of plant life and  the proud defiance of the aged tree. He loved the mountain solitudes to  which he gave a new imagery, so authoritative and so perfect that it  served to create a school.    The influence of Ma Yuean was felt by his brother and by his son, Ma Lin.  Although the death of the latter occurred under the Mongolian dynasty, he  was an exponent of Sung art. The fierce energy of the old master gives way  to a somewhat more melancholy and gentle quality in his son. There is the  same restraint in the handling of the brush, the same reserve in the use  of color, but the landscape stretches out into deep and dreamy vistas that  are indescribably poetic. The melancholy of autumn, the sadness of flights  of birds that circle in the evening light, the feeling of seclusion and  silence, such are the things in which this poetic spirit finds its joy,  true heir of the master mind whose genius found expression in the wild  aspects of nature.    The school of Ma dominated the entire subsequent period and his influence  extended as far as Korea, where traces of it were still to be found as  late as the fifteenth century. As the history of Korean painting becomes  better known, we shall be able to say with more accuracy what it owes to  other Chinese masters; but in so far as those mentioned are concerned,  their influence appears to have been sufficiently strong to impress a  certain type on fragmentary works from Korea which have become known to us  recently.    We are far from being as well informed regarding Hsia Kuei, but we have  that which is worth more than written records, a few paintings preserved  in Japanese collections, which it seems legitimate to attribute to him  without reservation. It is readily seen why his name is always linked with  that of Ma Yuean. His work shows the same energy and power and discloses an  ideal which is similar to that of his confrere. He seems to have  penetrated even further than Ma Yuean along the path of daring  simplifications, and to have approached at times the calligraphic style.  He painted both landscape and figures and was skilled in obtaining strange  effects, as if of color, through his use of monochrome.    Another painter whose name dominates the history of this time and whose  work serves to characterize a special aspect is Li Lung-mien. It is  naturally difficult to prove that all the works attributed to him are  authentic. However, collections in Japanese temples or privately owned,  possess paintings which passed as his at a very early date and in which at  least we can recognize his style. In reviewing the centuries of history,  it is interesting to note that the work of Li Lung-mien is not without  similarity, in certain of its elements, to the paintings of Ku K'ai-chih.  His line is delicate and flexible and he draws his outlines with the same  subtlety, the same grace and the same instinct for harmonious curves and  an extraordinary rhythm.    The tradition which arose in a period antedating the T'ang epoch was  therefore still unbroken in the Sung period, and I am sure that proofs of  this will increase in number as our information becomes more accurate. New  evidence furnished by the paintings found at Tun-huang and certain  frescoes at Murtuq has recently shown that the type of Buddhist  hermit--the Lohan meditating in solitude--whose inception had, until these  discoveries, been attributed to Li Lung-mien, in reality dated much  further back and originated in the Buddhist art of Eastern Turkestan,  perhaps even in India. From those regions are derived the magnificent  subjects of which Li Lung-mien made use to express meditation. Sometimes  there are emaciated faces, withered bodies with protruding tendons that  outline deep hollows, and again rotund and peaceful figures meditating in  tranquil seclusion. From the written records as well as in his works,  there is every evidence that he was one of those who revived Buddhist  painting. No matter what models he chose to follow, he always gave them a  stress and a peculiar distinction, while from the standpoint of pure art  he had the ability to portray them with finished elegance and majestic  dignity.    Li Lung-mien was not content to paint Buddhist figures only. He painted  landscape also, and in his youth he had painted horses. A great critic of  the Sung period said of him that \"his soul entered into communion with all  things, his spirit penetrated the mysteries and the secrets of nature.\"  This critic added that one day he saw Li Lung-mien painting a Buddhist  divinity. The words of the god fairly leapt from the lines; it seemed as  if the brush of the master summoned them one by one into being. Like all  the masters of his time, Li Lung-mien sought to free the spirit from its  outward semblance. Beyond the material, he perceived the immaterial force  which animates the world. As a landscape painter his conception of Nature  was broad and majestic. His graceful and harmonious line recalls the  happiest moments in the history of plastic art, and he challenges  comparison with a facile genius like Raphael. But he includes the whole  realm of nature in his subjects, and in his work we find traces, expressed  with greater breadth, but with quite as keen an insight, of an ancient  and noble art, such as was found almost extinct in the work of Ku  K'ai-chih.      [Illustration: PLATE XIII. PIGEONS BY CH'IEN HSUeAN    Yuean Period. Collection of R. Petrucci.]    We cannot leave the Sung painters without devoting some attention to Mi  Fei and his son. The two Mi's, indeed, accomplished a far-reaching reform  in Chinese technique; they enriched painting with a new imagery and  founded a school which, like that of Ma, exerted an influence on later  periods and was strongly felt in Korea.    In addition to being a great painter, Mi Fei was a great calligraphist.  This is apparent however little one may have seen of work in his style. He  possesses in the highest degree what the Chinese describe as the \"handling  of flowing ink.\" He used the technique of monochrome almost exclusively,  and so closely related tone values to the line, or rather to the  brush-stroke, that it is difficult to decide whether he paints rather than  draws, or draws rather than paints. Properly speaking, he does not employ  the line at all but works by masses, by broad, heavily inked touches,  without pausing to emphasize the deep warm blacks provided by Chinese ink.  His manner recalls certain drawings by Rembrandt, also produced by strong  inking, which evoke a strange and magical effect of light. Such was the  spirit in which Mi Fei treated landscape. This technique marks his style  and gives it an individuality that is indisputable. The vehemence with  which he attacks forms, the rapidity of his brush-stroke, the way in which  things spring from such energy, call to mind pictures by European  masters, painted in full color, and it may be said of the paintings of Mi  Fei that they are fairly _colored_ by their tremendous vitality, if the  quality of the materials he employed permits the use of such a term.  Therefore Mi Fei and his son are responsible for a new technique, a  strongly individual work, and the creation of a style which marks the  highest achievement in monochrome. The trend which impelled them was,  however, general. Carried to its extreme it led to the style of painting  called calligraphic, of which there has been occasion to speak several  times.    Calligraphic painting, or the _literary style_, has its origin in the  studies of Wang Wei when, renouncing the aid of colour, he strove by  harmony of shading and by tone values, to reproduce the vast reaches of  space and all the shifting subtlety of atmospheric perspective. The  exclusive use of Chinese ink necessitated special studies since thus  calligraphy was directly approached. The different styles of writing are  almost drawing in themselves. Each style of writing has its own rules for  dissecting the written character and making the stroke. Now, as is known,  the Chinese painters attached supreme importance to the line and to the  brush-stroke. This was due in part to their equipment and in part to the  fact that the amateurs of art were prepared by their classical studies to  appreciate the strength or the delicacy of a line judged for itself, quite  independently of the forms represented. We must also bear in mind that  all of the Chinese painters were scholars, belonging to the class of the  literati.[14] Writers, poets, statesmen, soldiers, Buddhist or Taoist  priests, and philosophers have all furnished the greatest names in art.  Under such conditions the technical relationship between the line of the  painter and that of the calligraphist was closer, since painter and  calligraphist were frequently united in one and the same person. Thence  came the early tendency to use monochrome and to represent forms in the  abstract, rendering them more and more as mere themes,"]]]
