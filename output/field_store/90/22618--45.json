Then my coming was always a signal for her to give a series  of tea-parties; they were not very large ones, because her room wouldn't  hold many people at a time, and then I used to have to tell my stories  to each set of guests.  Aunt Priscilla was never tired of listening to  them, and I found out by the way she corrected me if I made the  slightest variation.  I had, therefore, to be very particular the first  time I told a story, so that I might not afterwards be caught tripping.  Yes; dear, good Aunt Priscilla, I am sure that she will be anxious when  she finds that the old tea-chest hasn't arrived at the time expected.  There's one comfort, I shall be able to give her notice of my safety  before she hears positively of the fate of the ship.\"    Though Charley White did not talk of himself, I was able to form a very  fair judgment of his character from the way he spoke of the old lady,  and I found afterwards that I was correct.  We found him a very pleasant  addition to our family party on board, and I soon got to look on him  like one of my own sons; he was, besides, of great assistance to us in  navigating the little schooner.  The gale at length ceased, and we stood  for Table Bay.  I was afraid of venturing the run across the Indian  Ocean without landing at Cape Town, lest we might get short of water; a  want, which besides exposing us to suffering, would have caused the  destruction of all our sheep.  We remained but a few days at Cape Town.  Charley White wrote home an account of the loss of the ship, and sent a  letter to his Aunt Priscilla assuring her of his safety.  I expected,  and thought of it with much regret, that he would here leave us.  I  invited him, however, to cast in his fortunes with ours, and without  hesitation, much to the satisfaction of all our party, he accepted my  offer.  \"You know,\" he said, \"when we get settled, I can send home for  Aunt Priscilla, or go and fetch her, and I think that she would like the  life.  It would be much more satisfactory than her round of tea-parties,  and give her something to think of besides her cats and dog, and I am  sure that you would all like her.\"    We of course said that we had no doubt we should, though Susan remarked  afterwards, that a real lady, as she supposed she was, from her giving  tea-parties and having two cats and a poodle, would scarcely like to  come out and live in the bush with such homely people as we were.  I  will tell you by and by what came of it.    The people at the Cape, when they saw the size of the _May Flower_ and  the way she was laden, were surprised at our having come so far in  safety, and some chose to declare that we should never reach the end of  our voyage.  I replied that they did not know the qualities of the  little craft; that many a big ship had gone down when small ones had  floated; that it was not so much the size of a vessel as the way she was  put together, and the quality of her gear, which made her safe or  unsafe, and moreover, that the same Providence which had protected us  hitherto was not sleeping.  That was the feeling which kept me up from  first to last throughout our undertaking.    We heard at the Cape some news which gave me more concern than anything  else.  It was, that war was again about to break out between England and  France, and that as many other nations were likely to be leagued with  France in arms against our country, we should have no small number of  enemies among whom to run the gauntlet.  My chief hope was that we  should arrive at our destination before the news of the actual  commencement of hostilities could reach the enemy's cruisers in the  Eastern seas.  One thing, however, I remembered; it was, that bad news  travels fast, and I have come to the conclusion that no news is worse  than that which tells of two civilised nations going to war.    Earthquakes, fires, floods, disasters at sea, are very bad; but war  means that thousands of the flowers of manhood are to be cut down in  their prime, or maimed, or wounded; that numbers of children are to be  made orphans; wives are to become widows; and fruitful lands laid  desolate.  Such is war; ah! such is war.    I had made up my mind to go on to Australia, though I had many tempting  offers to remain at the Cape.  I daresay that we should have found a  happy home there, and it is a fine colony; but I have reason to be  thankful that we persevered.  My children enjoyed their visit to the  shore, and the fresh bread and butter, and the fruit and vegetables; but  after all, they said that there was nothing like home (meaning the  little schooner), and they were glad to get back to her, thus showing  that they were not tired of the voyage.  Our old dog, Steadfast, made  himself particularly happy, frisking and scampering about in every  conceivable manner, till he looked, the children said, as if he would  tumble to pieces in the exuberance of his spirits.  They tried to induce  our cat, the Duchess, to accompany them, but she had learned to look on  the schooner as her home and wouldn't go.  Whenever they tried to catch  her, she ran up the rigging, though on other occasions she allowed them  to handle her as much as they liked.  Curious as it may seem, the  circumstance had a great effect on Bob Hunt and Dick Nailor, who were,  like many seamen, very superstitious.    \"She knows it's all right aboard here, and that we shan't come to no  harm,\" observed Bob to his mate.    \"Oh, course,\" answered Dick; \"I never knowed a cat stick to a ship, if  she could get away, which was to go down.  They are wonderful wise  creatures, and knows all sorts of things as is going to happen.  To be  sure they can scratch a bit when they fancies.\"    Cats will certainly stick to vessels whether they are to be wrecked or  not.  I remember falling in with an abandoned ship, the only living  thing on board being a cat; we took her off, and the vessel soon  afterwards went to pieces.    Once more we were at sea.  A westerly wind, which I was afraid we might  lose if we stood to the southward, induced me to run along the coast  closer in than I might otherwise have ventured.  The weather had  hitherto been very fine, and I persuaded myself that there was no risk.  I was wrong.  Suddenly, the wind shifted to the southwest of west, and  blowing strong, and though we hauled up immediately, before we got a  good offing it blew a strong gale from the southward directly on shore,  and a heavy rolling sea came tumbling in.  We could not venture to heave  to, and yet there was more sea and wind than the little craft could well  bear.  All we could do was to keep sail on her, and to steer as close to  the wind as she would lie.  I watched the coast with deep anxiety, and  couldn't help feeling that the foaming, raging waters, which now dashed  impetuously against it, might prove my grave and that of all dear to me.    Of course my son and Charley White and the two seamen saw our danger as  clearly as I did, but we did not communicate our ideas to each other,  and I was anxious not to alarm my dear wife and daughters.  The little  craft looked up bravely however, and my hopes revived; again they sank,  for the gale came down stronger than ever on us, and I saw that we were  driving closer and closer towards the shore.  A large ship might  possibly, by cutting away her masts have ridden out the gale at her  anchors; we, had we made the attempt, should have foundered.  My wife  and Mary and Susan had one after the other appeared at the companion  hatch, and with pale faces, as they saw the state of things, had gone  below again.  I hadn't the heart even to tell them my fears.  Bob Hunt  and Dick Nailor took matters very coolly.    \"The Duchess don't think anything will come of it,\" observed Bob to  Dick, pointing to the cat who was sitting on a coil of rope on the head  of a water cask lashed to the weather bulwarks.    \"May be not, but she may be mistaken once in a way, Bob,\" answered Dick,  who, seeing the imminent danger in which we were placed, lost his  confidence in the fore-knowledge of the cat.    From what may sound ridiculous, but was not really so, I must turn to a  more serious matter.  I suspected that my wife and daughters knew our  danger, though I had not told them of it.    We had driven still nearer to the land, and wishing to ascertain exactly  on what part of the coast we were, that I might, if possible, run the  vessel on shore on some spot where we might have a chance of saving our  lives I went below to examine the chart.        CHAPTER SIX.    IN SMOOTH WATER.    The cabin was very dark, from the skylight being covered over and  battened down.  The schooner was however so tight and strong, that  provided the hatches were on, I knew that she might almost roll over and  over, and yet not fill.  This gave me great confidence as long as we  kept to the open sea; but driven on rocks or quicksands, with such a  gale as was then blowing, there could have been no hope for the stoutest  ship that ever floated on the salt ocean.  As I was saying, I went into  the cabin; although gloomy enough on deck, it was still darker below;  for the gleam of light which came down the companion-hatch scarcely  found its way beyond the foot of the ladder.  I looked about me, and at  first thought that my wife and daughters had, in their terror, turned  into their berths; but soon, amid the creaking of the bulkheads, and the  rattling of the rigging, and the roaring of the storm, a gentle, sweet  voice reached my ears.  It was that of my daughter Susan.  She had not  heard me enter.  She was on her knees praying, so were her mother and  sisters, all round the table in the cabin.  She was lifting up her voice  to our loving, merciful Father in Heaven;--to the same God who stilled  the raging of the storm on Gennesaret, and said to the sea, \"Peace, be  still.\"  She was praying, dear girl, for me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2306"],[0,"Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings (#7)"],[1," Cow,' sez Brer Rabbit, sezee.    \"'W'y, howdy, Brer Rabbit,' sez Miss Cow, sez she.    \"'How you fine yo'se'f deze days, Sis Cow?' sez Brer Rabbit,  sezee.    \"'I'm sorter toler'ble, Brer Rabbit; how you come on?' sez Miss  Cow, sez she.    \"'Oh, I'm des toler'ble myse'f, Sis Cow; sorter linger'n' twix' a  bauk en a break-down,' sez Brer Rabbit, sezee.    \"'How yo' fokes, Brer Rabbit?' sez Miss Cow, sez she.    \"'Dey er des middlin', Sis Cow; how Brer Bull gittin' on?' sez  Brer Rabbit, sezee.    \"'Sorter so-so,' sez Miss Cow, sez she.    \"'Dey er some mighty nice 'simmons up dis tree, Sis Cow,' sez  Brer Rabbit, sezee, 'en I'd like mighty well fer ter have some un  um,' sezee.    \"'How you gwineter git um, Brer Rabbit?' sez she.    \"'I 'lowed maybe dat I might ax you fer ter butt 'gin de tree, en  shake some down, Sis Cow,' sez Brer Rabbit, sezee.    \"C'ose Miss Cow don't wanter diskommerdate Brer Rabbit, en she  march up ter de 'simmon tree, she did, en hit it a rap wid 'er  horns--blam!
