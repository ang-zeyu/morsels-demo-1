This suggestion more or  less received the approval of the Government and plans were drawn up  for a new library building.    The war intervened, but since 1950 the question has become increasingly  prominent, and there have been two inquiries. While it is possible to  combine a purely legislative and national reference library, I have  doubts on the complete absorption of a parliamentary library by a  national library. In the United States, for example, the Library of  Congress gives both services, but Congress and its needs are supreme.  The library seemingly envisaged for New Zealand would have wider scope  and unless very carefully planned and managed, there could be conflict  between Parliament and the department controlling the library.    The Library also played its part in the establishment of the Country  and later the National Library Services. In 1935 Dr Scholefield  travelled overseas at the invitation of the Carnegie Corporation of New  York and on his return made a report on rural library services, which  turned further attention to this matter.    A group of New Zealand librarians interested the Carnegie Corporation  of New York in the proposal to organise a demonstration scheme in  Taranaki and asked Mr G. T. Alley to prepare plans. In 1937, however,  L3,000 was placed on the Estimates for the Country Library Service and  Mr Alley was appointed Director later in the year. For some time the  Service was also located in Parliament Buildings.    Twenty years earlier the Library had also assisted in the  reorganisation of the Turnbull Library as a State library. Mr J. C.  Andersen was for some time on the staff, resigning to become first  Librarian. In addition, both Mr Wilson and Dr Scholefield were in turn  Advisory Directors to the Turnbull Library until the post was abolished  in 1930.      _The Library as a Museum_    The Library has during its century collected many curios which should  really have been given to a museum. The Library Committee has had to  decide frequently whether historical relics could be displayed. In  1886, after the Taiaha of Wahanui presented to James Bryce had been  refused, the Committee laid down that nothing but books, manuscripts,  maps, etc., should be deposited without special permission.    However the Library possesses today many such relics. There are the  caskets containing the Freedoms of certain cities presented to Mr  Fraser, a similar collection of Mr Seddon's and of Sir Joseph Ward's,  the pen used by Mr Massey to sign the Treaty of Versailles, a kava  bowl, mats, etc., from Samoa, and many other items. The Library also  had for a time the Bishop Monrad etchings and the Chevalier pictures,  but these were handed over to the Turnbull Library and Academy of Fine  Arts respectively.    The display of such objects tends to attract to the Library visitors  not interested in the books, but whose conversation distracts more  serious readers.      _Purchase of Books_    Though today books are purchased in many countries most of the books  have always been obtained in England. The first books were bought from  Smith and Elder in London, but this was not continued. Instead, an  arrangement was entered into with a Mr Maberly of Auckland, partner in  a London firm of booksellers, to obtain and bind books uniformly.    In the following years the Library had several London agents, none of  whom were entirely satisfactory, while some were quite the reverse.  What the Library Committee wanted was a reliable buyer who could  provide books cheaply and in addition supply the more important books  as they were published without duplicating them in later orders.  Including the time taken for reviews to reach New Zealand, for them to  be read, the books to be ordered and dispatched to New Zealand, it  would be not far short of a year before a book published in England  reached the shelves of the Library.    After several changes of agent in quick time the Committee in 1883  asked the authority of Cabinet to use the Agent-General in London to  purchase books. This was given and book purchase was put on a happier  basis. This was particularly so in the first years when Sir Francis  Bell was Agent-General. Though the books were supplied by a bookseller  in Edinburgh, Sir Francis, as a former member of the Library Committee,  took a personal interest in the orders and anticipated the purchase of  many popular books.    The High Commissioner in London, successor to the Agent-General, has  continued to oversee the purchase of books for the Library either from  booksellers or from the publishers. He has been of invaluable  assistance to the Library in this task; and the assistance given in  this field is only paralleled by that of the other overseas agencies of  New Zealand, particularly those in the United States, Canada, and  Australia.    A large and increasing number of books has also been purchased from  booksellers in New Zealand. Particularly in the case of novels, it is  of advantage to inspect the book before buying a copy.    For many years books purchased in England were rebound uniformly in  morocco. In 1886, in an attempt to reduce costs, the Committee decided  that works costing less than 10s. were to be sent out in the ordinary  cloth binding. The more expensive and important works still continued  to be rebound in leather, but as time went on this too was discontinued  and all books were dispatched in the publisher's binding.                             THE AIMS OF THE LIBRARY    What does the General Assembly Library exist for and what does it  set out to do? Its primary function is to assist members to obtain  information needed for the performance of their parliamentary duties  and also to make available to them books, periodicals, etc., which may  better equip them as men of affairs.    From the first the Library set out to obtain books on matters and  topics likely to be the subject of legislation and on matters likely to  be of interest to members. As funds became available and the Library  grew it was also possible to purchase books for recreational reading,  but this has always been a lesser aim.    The necessity for obtaining books on matters likely to be subject to  legislation has directly led to the acquisition of books relating to  New Zealand. The principal subject of legislation before the New  Zealand Parliament is New Zealand, and in order to give the information  required it is essential to have as complete a collection as possible  on New Zealand.    The advent of the Liberal Government in 1891, and later of the Labour  Government, led to wide extension of the field of legislation and  consequently of the stock of the Library. Today the Library is strong  in official publications, in economics, politics, administration, law,  and statistics; there are good collections in history, biography, and  travel, and also an excellent reference collection.    The staff have always given members of Parliament every possible  service, but the scope has tended to grow. Last century members tended  to do more of their own research, and relied on the staff to locate  books rather than individual items of information. The desire for this  last service grew and attempts were made to provide it.    To do so, however, required considerable advances in staff and  technique. It involved the indexing of periodicals, often attempted by  the staff which was rarely in a position to do it well and to continue  it. Today much of this work is done either commercially or  cooperatively and, although the results are not available quickly, the  staff is freed for other work.    Today the Library is working towards the time when it can give a  reference and research service similar to that of the House of Commons  Library, or to imitate in a smaller way that of the Library of Congress  in Washington. Such a service requires intelligent, well trained staff  who are capable of locating and organising information into a form  where it can be readily understood and used.    The Library is doing an increasing amount of such work, but it has not  the staff to do all that is required of it. I am sure, however, that  before the story of the Library is much longer, it will be giving a  fuller service.    In this connection there is one aspect of the work that should not be  passed over--the indexing of newspapers. Newspapers have always been  important to the Library, giving as they do so much current history and  opinion. Only in recent years has it been possible to index certain  papers fully, and so provide quickly necessary references.                                  BOOKS AND MEN    Books are of little value without men to care for them and men to use  them, so that to be successful a library needs good books and good men.  The General Assembly Library has been fortunate in the men who have  controlled it and the men who have used it.    No librarian can ask for more than the support and interest of those  who control the library, or that the material and information he  provides is being put to good use. No user of a library can ask for  more than the real interest and help of the librarians in his research  and reading. Again the General Assembly Library has been lucky in the  interest shown by members of Parliament and by the staff who have  served in it.    Some names have been mentioned here; many more should have been.  Suffice it to say that as far as Parliament is concerned many members  have given generously of their time and energy to help make the Library  what it is today.    The same remarks can be applied to the staff. They are fortunate, for  their work gives a pleasure that much work does not, and so makes doing  it so much easier.    This support from members of Parliament and from the staff gives the  Library such reserves that it faces its second century with confidence.

It was not less than a personal insult, which I deeply  resented. Evidently my chief had resolved to keep us in the  background; he would not trust our commando in the fighting line. In  short, he would not keep his word and give us another chance to recoup  our losses.    I had, however, made up my mind, and ordered the commando to march to  Ladysmith. If the General would not have me at the front I should  cease to be an officer. And, although I had no friends of influence  who could help me I resolved to take the bull by the horns, and leave  the rest to fate.    On the 1st November, 1899, we reached the main army near Ladysmith,  and I went at once to tell General Joubert in person that my men  wanted to fight, and not to play policemen in the rear of the army.  Having given the order to dismount I proceeded to Joubert's tent,  walked in with as much boldness as I could muster, and saluted the  General, who was fortunately alone. I at once opened my case, telling  him how unfair it was to keep us in the rear, and that the burghers  were loudly protesting against such treatment. This plea was generally  used throughout the campaign when an officer required something to be  granted him. At first the old General was very wrathful. He said I had  disobeyed his orders and that he had a mind to have me shot for breach  of discipline. However, after much storming in his fine bass voice, he  grew calmer, and in stentorian tones ordered me for the time being to  join General Schalk Burger, who was operating near Lombard's Kop in  the siege of Ladysmith.    That same evening I arrived there with my commando and reported myself  to Lieut-General Burger. One of his adjutants, Mr. Joachim Fourie, who  distinguished himself afterwards on repeated occasions and was killed  in action near his house in the Carolina district, showed me a place  to laager in. We pitched our tents on the same spot where a few days  before Generals White and French had been defeated, and there awaited  developments.    At this place the British, during the battle of Nicholson's Nek, had  hidden a large quantity of rifle and gun ammunition in a hole in the  ground, covering it up with grass, which gave it the appearance of a  heap of rubbish. One of the burghers who feared this would be  injurious to the health of our men in camp, set the grass on fire, and  this soon penetrated to the ammunition. A tremendous explosion  occurred, and it seemed as if there were a real battle in progress.  From all sides burghers dashed up on horseback to learn where the  fighting was taking place. General Joubert sent an adjutant to enquire  whether the Johannesburgers were now killing each other for a change,  and why I could not keep my men under better control. I asked this  gentleman to be kind enough to see for himself what was taking place,  and to tell the Commandant-General that I could manage well enough to  keep my men in order, but could not be aware of the exact spot where  the enemy had chosen to hide their ammunition.    Meanwhile, it became daily more evident to me how greatly Joubert  depreciated my commando, and that we would have to behave very well  and fight very bravely to regain his favour. Other commandos also  seemed to have no better opinion, and spoke of us as the laager which  had to run at Elandslaagte, forgetting how even General Meyer's huge  commando had been obliged to retreat in the greatest confusion at  Dundee. If all the details of this Dundee engagement were published it  would be discovered that it was a Boer disaster only second to that of  Elandslaagte.    We were now, however, at any rate at the front. I sent out my outposts  and fixed my positions, which were very far from good; but I decided  to make no complaints. We had resolved to do our very best to  vindicate our honour, and to prove that our accusers had no reason to  call us either cowards or good-for-nothings.          CHAPTER VII.    THE BOER GENERAL'S SUPERSTITIONS.      A few days after we had arrived before Ladysmith we joined an  expedition to reconnoitre the British entrenchments, and my commando  was ordered near some forts on the north-westerly side of the town.  Both small and large artillery were being fired from each side. We  approached within 800 paces of a fort; it was broad daylight and the  enemy could therefore see us distinctly, knew the exact range, and  received us with a perfect hailstorm of fire. Our only chance was to  seek cover behind kopjes and in ditches, for on any Boer showing his  head the bullets whistled round his ears. Here two of my burghers were  severely wounded, and we had some considerable trouble to get them  through the firing line to our ambulance. At last, late in the  afternoon, came the order to retire, and we retired after having  achieved nothing.    I fail to this day to see the use of this reconnoitring, but at  Ladysmith everything was equally mysterious and perplexing. It was  perhaps that my knowledge of military matters was too limited to  understand the subtle manoeuvres of those days. But I have made up my  mind not to criticise our leader's military strategy, though I must  say at this juncture that the whole siege of Ladysmith and the manner  in which the besieged garrison was ineffectually pounded at with our  big guns for several months, seem to me an unfathomable mystery,  which, owing to Joubert's untimely death, will never be explained  satisfactorily. But I venture to describe Joubert's policy outside  Ladysmith as stupid and primitive, and in another chapter I shall  again refer to it.    After another fortnight or so, we were ordered away to guard another  position to the south-west of Ladysmith, as the Free State commando  under Commandant Nel, and, unless I am mistaken, under Field-Cornet  Christian de Wet (afterwards the world-famous chief Commander of the  Orange Free State, and of whom all Afrikanders are justly proud), had  to go to Cape Colony.    Here I was under the command of Dijl Erasmus, who was then General and  a favourite of General Joubert. We had plenty of work given us.  Trenches had to be dug and forts had to be constructed and remodelled.  At this time an expedition ventured to Estcourt, under General Louis  Botha, who replaced General L. Meyer, sent home on sick leave. My  commando joined the expedition under Field-Cornet J. Kock, who  afterwards caused me a lot of trouble.    I can say but little of this expedition to Estcourt, save that the  Commander-in-Chief accompanied it. But for his being with us, I am  convinced that General Botha would have pushed on at least as far as  Pietermaritzburg, for the English were at that time quite unable to  stop our progress. But after we got to Estcourt, practically  unopposed, Joubert, though our burghers had been victorious in battle  after battle, ordered us to retreat. The only explanation General  Joubert ever vouchsafed about the recall of this expedition was that  in a heavy thunderstorm which had been raging for two nights near  Estcourt, two Boers had been struck by lightning, which, according to  his doctrine, was an infallible sign from the Almighty that the  commandos were to proceed no further. It seems incredible that in  these enlightened days we should find such a man in command of an  army; it is, nevertheless, a fact that the loss of two burghers  induced our Commandant-General to recall victorious commandos who were  carrying all before them. The English at Pietermaritzburg, and even at  Durban, were trembling lest we should push forward to the coast,  knowing full well that in no wise could they have arrested our  progress. And what an improvement in our position this would have  meant! As it was, our retirement encouraged the British to push  forward their fighting line so far as Chieveley Station, near the  Tugela river, and the commandos had to take up a position in the  \"randjes,\" on the westerly banks of the Tugela.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE \"GREAT POWERS\" TO INTERVENE.      During the retreat of our army to the frontier of the Transvaal  Republic nothing of importance occurred. Here again confusion reigned  supreme, and none of the commandos were over-anxious to form  rearguards. Our Hollander Railway Company made a point of placing a  respectful distance between her rolling-stock and the enemy, and,  anxious to lose as few carriages as possible, raised innumerable  difficulties when asked to transport our men, provisions and  ammunition. Our generals had meantime proceeded to Laing's Nek by rail  to seek new positions, and there was no one to maintain order and  discipline.    About 150 Natal Afrikanders who had joined our commandos when these  under the late General Joubert occupied the districts about Newcastle  and Ladysmith, now found themselves in an awkward position. They  elected to come with us, accompanied by their families and live stock,  and they offered a most heartrending spectacle. Long rows of carts and  wagons wended their way wearily along the road to Laing's Nek. Women  in tears, with their children and infants in arms, cast reproachful  glances at us as being the cause of their misery. Others occupied  themselves more usefully in driving their cattle. Altogether it was a  scene the like of which I hope never to see again.    The Natal kaffirs now had an opportunity of displaying their hatred  towards the Boers. As soon as we had left a farm and its male  inhabitants had gone, they swooped down on the place and wrought havoc  and ruin, plundering and looting to their utmost carrying capacity.  Some even assaulted women and children, and the most awful atrocities  were committed. I attach more blame to the whites who encouraged these  plundering bands, especially some of the Imperial troops and Natal  "]]]
