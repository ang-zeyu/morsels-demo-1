And wilt thou not now tarry for a day,--      A day which may redeem thee? Wilt thou not      Yield to the few still faithful a few hours,      For them, for thee, for thy past fathers' race,      And for thy sons' inheritance?        _Pan._                         'Tis true!                          590      From the deep urgency with which the Prince      Despatched me to your sacred presence, I      Must dare to add my feeble voice to that      Which now has spoken.        _Sar._               No, it must not be.        _Myr._ For the sake of thy realm!        _Sar._                             Away!        _Pan._                                 For that      Of all thy faithful subjects, who will rally      Round thee and thine.        _Sar._               These are mere fantasies:      There is no peril:--'tis a sullen scheme      Of Salemenes, to approve his zeal,      And show himself more necessary to us.                             600        _Myr._ By all that's good and glorious take this counsel.        _Sar._ Business to-morrow.        _Myr._                    Aye--or death to-night.        _Sar._ Why let it come then unexpectedly,      'Midst joy and gentleness, and mirth and love;      So let me fall like the plucked rose!--far better      Thus than be withered.        _Myr._                 Then thou wilt not yield,      Even for the sake of all that ever stirred      A monarch into action, to forego      A trifling revel.        _Sar._            No.        _Myr._               Then yield for _mine_;      For my sake!        _Sar._      Thine, my Myrrha!        _Myr._                      'Tis the first                         610      Boon which I ever asked Assyria's king.        _Sar._ That's true, and, wer't my kingdom, must be granted.      Well, for thy sake, I yield me. Pania, hence!      Thou hear'st me.        _Pan._           And obey.                              [_Exit_ PANIA.        _Sar._                     I marvel at thee.      What is thy motive, Myrrha, thus to urge me?        _Myr._ Thy safety; and the certainty that nought      Could urge the Prince thy kinsman to require      Thus much from thee, but some impending danger.        _Sar._ And if I do not dread it, why shouldst thou?        _Myr._ Because _thou_ dost not fear, I fear for _thee_.            620        _Sar._ To-morrow thou wilt smile at these vain fancies.        _Myr._ If the worst come, I shall be where none weep,      And that is better than the power to smile.      And thou?        _Sar._    I shall be King, as heretofore.        _Myr._ Where?        _Sar._         With Baal, Nimrod, and Semiramis,      Sole in Assyria, or with them elsewhere.

Oh! we lose      Ten thousand precious moments in vain words,      And vainer fears. Within there!--ye slaves, deck      The Hall of Nimrod for the evening revel;      If I must make a prison of our palace,      At least we'll wear our fetters jocundly;      If the Euphrates be forbid us, and      The summer-dwelling on its beauteous border,      Here we are still unmenaced. Ho! within there!                     640                                                       [_Exit_ SARDANAPALUS.        _Myr._ (_solus_).      Why do I love this man? My country's daughters      Love none but heroes. But I have no country!      The slave hath lost all save her bonds. I love him;      And that's the heaviest link of the long chain--      To love whom we esteem not. Be it so:      The hour is coming when he'll need all love,      And find none. To fall from him now were baser      Than to have stabbed him on his throne when highest      Would have been noble in my country's creed:      I was not made for either. Could I save him,                       650      I should not love _him_ better, but myself;      And I have need of the last, for I have fallen      In my own thoughts, by loving this soft stranger:      And yet, methinks, I love him more, perceiving      That he is hated of his own barbarians,      The natural foes of all the blood of Greece.      Could I but wake a single thought like those      Which even the Phrygians felt when battling long      'Twixt Ilion and the sea, within his heart,      He would tread down the barbarous crowds, and triumph.             660      He loves me, and I love him; the slave loves      Her master, and would free him from his vices.      If not, I have a means of freedom still,      And if I cannot teach him how to reign,      May show him how alone a King can leave      His throne. I must not lose him from my sight.

The Sun goes down: methinks he sets more slowly,      Taking his last look of Assyria's Empire.      How red he glares amongst those deepening clouds,      Like the blood he predicts. If not in vain,      Thou Sun that sinkest, and ye stars which rise,      I have outwatched ye, reading ray by ray      The edicts of your orbs, which make Time tremble[j]      For what he brings the nations, 'tis the furthest      Hour of Assyria's years. And yet how calm!      An earthquake should announce so great a fall--                     10      A summer's sun discloses it. Yon disk,      To the star-read Chaldean, bears upon      Its everlasting page the end of what      Seemed everlasting; but oh! thou true Sun!      The burning oracle of all that live,      As fountain of all life, and symbol of      Him who bestows it, wherefore dost thou limit      Thy lore unto calamity? Why not      Unfold the rise of days more worthy thine      All-glorious burst from ocean? why not dart                         20      A beam of hope athwart the future years,      As of wrath to its days? Hear me! oh, hear me!      I am thy worshipper, thy priest, thy servant--      I have gazed on thee at thy rise and fall,      And bowed my head beneath thy mid-day beams,      When my eye dared not meet thee. I have watched      For thee, and after thee, and prayed to thee,      And sacrificed to thee, and read, and feared thee,      And asked of thee, and thou hast answered--but      Only to thus much: while I speak, he sinks--                        30      Is gone--and leaves his beauty, not his knowledge,      To the delighted West, which revels in      Its hues of dying glory. Yet what is      Death, so it be but glorious? 'Tis a sunset;      And mortals may be happy to resemble      The Gods but in decay.                        _Enter_ ARBACES _by an inner door_.        _Arb._                Beleses, why      So wrapt in thy devotions?

The Indian gave so favourable a report of the treatment he had received,  that a cacique in the neighbourhood, and some of his people, visited the  ships.  They were handsomer than any yet met with, and of a gentle and  peaceable disposition.  Several of them wore ornaments of gold, which  they readily exchanged for trifles.    Another young cacique shortly afterwards appeared, carried on a litter  borne by four men, and attended by two hundred of his subjects.  He was  received on board, and, Columbus being at dinner, he came down with two  of his councillors, who seated themselves at his feet.  He merely tasted  whatever was given to him, and then sent it to his followers.    Dinner being over, he presented to the Admiral two pieces of gold, and a  curiously-worked belt, evidently the wampum still employed by the North  American Indians as a token of peace.  Columbus, in return, gave him a  piece of cloth, several amber beads, coloured shoes, and, showing him a  Spanish coin with the heads of the King and Queen, endeavoured to  explain to him the power and grandeur of his sovereigns, as well as the  standard of the cross; but these apparently failed to have any effect on  the mind of the savage chieftain.  Columbus also had a large cross  erected in the centre of the village, and, from the respect the Indians  paid to it, he argued that it would be easy to convert them to  Christianity.    Again sailing on the 20th of December, the expedition anchored in the  Bay of Acul.  Here the inhabitants received them with the greatest  frankness.  They appeared to have no idea of traffic, but freely gave  everything they possessed, though Columbus ordered that articles should  be given in exchange for all received.    Several caciques came off, inviting the Spaniards to their villages.  Among them came an envoy from an important chief named Guacanagari,  ruling over all that part of the island.  Having presented a broad belt  of wampum and a wooden mask, the eyes, nose, and tongue of which were of  gold, he requested that the ships would come off the town where the  cacique resided.  As this was impossible, owing to a contrary wind,  Columbus sent the notary of the squadron, with several attendants.  The  town was the largest and best built they had yet seen.  The cacique  received them in a large, clean square, and presented to each a robe of  cotton, while the inhabitants brought fruits and provisions of various  sorts.  The seamen were also received into their houses, and presented  with cotton garments and anything they seemed to admire; while the  articles given in return were treasured up as sacred relics.    Several caciques had in the meantime visited the ships.  They mentioned  a region, evidently the interior, called Cibao, which Columbus thought  must be a corruption of Cipango, and whose chief he understood had  banners of wrought gold, and was probably the magnificent prince  mentioned by Marco Polo.    As soon as the wind was fair, Columbus visited the chief, Guacanagari,  the coast having been surveyed by boats the previous day.  Feeling  perfectly secure, although so near the coast, he retired to his cabin.  The helmsman handed over his charge to one of the ship's boys, and  failed to notice that breakers were ahead.  Suddenly the ship struck;  the master and crew rushed on deck.  Columbus, calm as usual, ordered  the pilot to carry out an anchor astern.  Instead of so doing, in his  fright, he rowed off to the other caravel, about half a league to  windward.  Her commander instantly went to the assistance of his chief.  The ship had meantime been drifting more and more on the reef, the shock  having opened several of her seams.  The weather continued fine, or she  must at once have gone to pieces.    The Admiral, having gone on board the caravel, sent envoys to  Guacanagari, informing him of his intended visit and his disastrous  shipwreck.  When the cacique, who lived a league and a half off, heard  of the misfortune, he shed tears, and sent a fleet of canoes to render  assistance.  With their help the vessel was unloaded, the chief taking  care that none of the effects should be pilfered.  Not an article was  taken; indeed, the people exhibited the greatest sympathy with their  guests, who were treated with the utmost hospitality.    Two days afterwards Guacanagari came on board the _Nina_ to visit the  Admiral, and, with tears in his eyes, offered him all he possessed.  While he was on board a canoe arrived with pieces of gold, and, on  observing his countenance light up, the cacique told him there was a  place not far off, among the mountains, where it could be procured in  the greatest abundance.  He called the place Cibao, which Columbus still  confounded with that of Cipango.    Guacanagari, after dining on board, where he exhibited the utmost  frankness, invited Columbus to his village.  Here he had prepared an  abundant banquet, consisting of coneys, fish, roots, and various fruits.  He afterwards conducted the Admiral to some beautiful groves, where a  thousand natives were collected to perform their national games and  dances.    In return, the Admiral sent on board for a Castilian accustomed to the  use of the Moorish bow and arrows.  The cacique was greatly surprised at  the skill with which the Castilian used his weapon, and told him that  the Caribs, who made frequent descents on his territory, were also armed  with bows and arrows.    Columbus promised his protection, and, to show his host the powerful  means at his disposal, ordered a heavy cannon and an arquebus to be  discharged.  At the report the Indians fell to the ground, as if they  had been struck by a thunderbolt.  As they saw the shot shivering a  tree, they were filled with dismay, until Columbus assured them that  these weapons should be turned against their enemies.    The cacique now presented Columbus with a wooden mask, the eyes, ears,  and other parts, of gold; and he also placed a golden crown on his head,  and hung plates of gold round his neck.  The natives, though willing to  receive anything in exchange for gold, were chiefly delighted with the  hawks' bells, dancing and playing a dozen antics as they listened to the  sound.  An Indian gave even a handful of gold for one of the toys, and  then bounded away, fearing that the stranger might repent having parted  so cheaply with such an inestimable a treasure.  The shipwrecked  Spaniards, delighted with their idle life on shore, expressed their wish  to remain on the island.  This, with the friendly behaviour of the  natives, induced Columbus to agree to their proposal.  He considered  that they might explore the island, learn the language and manners of  the natives, and procure by traffic a large amount of gold.  He resolved  also to build a fortress for their defence, to be armed with the guns  saved from the wreck.  With his usual promptness he had the work  commenced.    When Guacanagari heard that some of the Spaniards were to be left on the  island for its defence from the Caribs, he was overjoyed, as were his  subjects, who eagerly lent their assistance in building the fortress,  little dreaming that they were assisting to place on their necks the  galling yoke of slavery.    While the work of the fortress was rapidly going on, Guacanagari treated  the Admiral with princely generosity.  As Columbus, on one occasion, was  landing, the cacique met him, accompanied by five tributary chiefs, each  carrying a coronet of gold.  On arriving at his house, Guacanagari took  off his own crown and placed it on the head of the Admiral.  Columbus  presented, in return, a collar of fine coloured beads, his mantle of  cloth, a pair of coloured boots, and placed on his finger a large ring  of silver, which the Indians valued far more than gold.  The cacique  also exerted himself to procure a great quantity of gold.    Columbus, by misunderstanding names and descriptions, formed the most  magnificent idea of the wealth of the interior of the island, and even  in the red pepper which abounded he fancied that he traced Oriental  spices.  He was thus led to believe that the shipwreck was providential,  as, had he sailed away, he should not have heard of its vast wealth.  What in some spirits would have awakened a grasping and sordid cupidity  to accumulate, immediately filled his vivid imagination with plans of  magnificent expenditure.    To the fortress, which was of some size, and sufficiently strong to  repulse a naked and unwarlike people, Columbus gave the name of La  Navidad, in memory of having escaped shipwreck on Christmas Day.  He  considered it very likely to prove most useful in keeping the garrison  themselves in order, and to prevent them wandering about and committing  acts of licentiousness among the natives.    Of the numbers who volunteered he selected thirty-nine in all, among  whom was a physician, a ship's carpenter, a cooper, a tailor, and a  gunner; the command being given to Diego de Arana, notary and alguazil  of the armament, with Pedro Gutierrez and Rodrigo de Escobedo as his  lieutenants, directing them to obtain all the information in their  power.  He charged the garrison to be especially circumspect in their  intercourse with the natives,--to treat them with gentleness and  justice,--to be highly discreet in their conduct towards the Indian  females, and, moreover, not to scatter themselves, or on any account  stray beyond the friendly territory of Guacanagari.    On the 2nd of January, 1493, Columbus bade farewell to the generous  cacique and his chieftains, commending those he left behind to their  care.  To impress the Indians with an idea of the warlike prowess of the  white man, after a banquet he had given at his house, he ordered them to  engage in mock fights with swords, bucklers, crossbows, arquebuses, and  cannon.    Guacanagari shed tears "]]]
