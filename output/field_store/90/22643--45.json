He  _wills_, perhaps; but he _un_wills in the next breath.    What is to be done with such a man, especially if he is a young one? He  is absolutely good for nothing. Business tires him; reading fatigues  him; the public service interferes with his pleasures, or restrains his  freedom. His life must be passed on a bed of down. If he is employed,  moments are as hours to him--if he is amused, hours are as moments. In  general, his whole time eludes him, he lets it glide unheeded, like  water under a bridge. Ask him what he has done with his morning,--he  cannot tell you; for he has lived without reflection, and almost  without knowing whether he has lived at all.    The indolent man sleeps as long as it is possible for him to sleep,  dresses slowly, amuses himself in conversation with the first person  that calls upon him, and loiters about till dinner. Or if he engages  in any employment, however important, he leaves it the moment an  opportunity of talking occurs. At length dinner is served up; and after  lounging at the table a long time, the evening will probably be spent  as unprofitably as the morning: and this it may be, is no unfair  specimen of his whole life. And is not such a wretch, for it is  improper to call him a man--good for nothing? What is he good for? How  can any rational being be willing to spend the precious gift of life in  a manner so worthless, and so much beneath the dignity of human nature?  When he is about stepping into the grave, how can he review the past  with any degree of satisfaction? What is his history, whether recorded  here or there,--in golden letters, or on the plainest slab--but, 'he  was born' and 'he died!'      SECTION VI. _Early Rising and Rest._    Dr. Rush mentions a patient of his who thought himself wonderfully  abstinent because he drank no spirituous or fermented liquors, _except  a bottle of wine or so_, after dinner!    In like manner some call it early to retire at _ten or eleven o'clock_.  Others think _ten very late_. Dr. Good, an English writer on medicine,  in treating of the appropriate means of preventing the gout in those  who are predisposed to it, after giving directions in regard to diet,  drink, exercise, &c., recommends an early hour of retiring to rest. 'By  all means,' says he, 'you should go to bed by eleven.'    To half the population of New England such a direction would seem  strange; but by the inhabitants of cities and large towns, who already  begin to ape the customs and fashions of the old world, the caution is  well understood. People who are in the habit of making and attending  parties which commence at 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening, can hardly be  expected to rise with the sun.    We hear much said about the benefit of the morning air. Many wise men  have supposed the common opinion on this subject to be erroneous; and  that the mistake has arisen from the fact that being refreshed and  invigorated by rest, the change is _within_ instead of _without_; that  our physical frames and mental faculties are more healthy than they  were the previous evening, rather than that the surrounding atmosphere  has altered.    Whether the morning air is _more_ healthy or not, it is certainly  healthy enough. Besides, there are so many reasons for early rising  that if I can persuade the reader to go to bed early, I shall have  little fear of his lying late in the morning.    1st. He who rises early and plans his work, and early sets himself  about it, generally finds his business go well with him the whole day.  He has taken time by the foretop; and will be sure to go before, or  _drive_ his business; while his more tardy neighbor 'suffers his  business to drive him.' There is something striking in the feeling  produced by beginning a day's work thus seasonably. It gives an impulse  to a man's thoughts, speech, and actions, which usually lasts through  the day. This is not a mere whim, but sober fact; as can be attested by  thousands. The person who rises late, usually pleads (for mankind are  very ingenious in defence of what falls in with their own  inclinations,) that he does as much in the progress of the day, as  those who rise early. This may, in a few instances, be true; but in  general, facts show the reverse. The motions of the early riser will be  more lively and vigorous all day. He may, indeed, become dull late in  the evening, but he ought to be so.    Sir Matthew Hale said that after spending a Sunday well, the rest of  the week was usually prosperous. This is doubtless to be accounted  for--in part at least--on the above principle.    2. In the warm season, the morning is the most agreeable time for  labor. Many farmers and mechanics in the country perform a good half  day's work before the people of the city scarcely know that the sun  shines.[2]    3. To lie snoring late in the morning, assimilates us to the most  beastly of animals. Burgh, an ingenious English writer, justly  observes; 'There is no time spent more stupidly than that which some  luxurious people pass in a morning between sleeping and waking, after  nature has been fully gratified. He who is awake may be doing  something: he who is asleep, is receiving the refreshment necessary to  fit him for action: but the hours spent in dozing and slumbering can  hardly be called existence.'    The late Dr. Smith, of Yale College, in his lectures, used to urge on  his hearers never to take '_the second nap_.' He said that if this rule  were steadily and universally followed by persons in health,--there  would be no dozing or oversleeping. If, for once, they should awake  from the first nap before nature was sufficiently restored, the next  night would restore the proper balance. In laying this down as a rule,  Dr. Smith would, of course, except those instances in which we are  awakened by accident.    4. It has been remarked by experienced physicians that they have  seldom, if ever, known a person of great age, who was not an early  riser. In enumerating the causes of longevity, Rush and Sinclair both  include early rising.    5. It is a trite but just maxim that one hour's sleep before midnight  is worth two afterward. Why it is so, would perhaps be difficult to  say. The power of habit is great, and as the majority of children are  trained to go to bed early, perhaps this will in part account for the  fact. So when the usual hour for meal arrives, a given amount of food  eaten at the time, is digested in a more healthy and regular manner  than if eaten one, or two, or three hours afterwards. Again, nature  certainly intended man should exercise during the day, and sleep in the  night. I do not say the _whole_ night; because in the winter and in  high northern latitudes, this would be devoting an unreasonable portion  of time to sleep. It would hardly do to sleep three or four months. But  in all countries, and in all climates, we should try to sleep half our  hours before midnight.    6. The person who, instead of going to bed at nine, sits up till  eleven, and then sleeps during two hours of daylight the following  morning, is grossly negligent of economy. For, suppose he makes this  his constant practice, during his whole _business_ life, say fifty  years. The extra oil or tallow which he would consume would not be  estimated at less than one cent an evening; which, in fifty years would  be $182.50. Not a very large sum to be sure; but, to every _young_ man,  worth saving; since, to a community of 1,000 young men, the amount  would be no less than $182,500. Then the loss in health and strength  would be far greater, though it is obvious that it cannot so easily be  computed.    7. Once more. If an hour's sleep before midnight is worth more than an  hour in the morning, then an hour in the morning is of course worth  less than an hour before midnight, and a person must sleep a greater  number of hours in the morning to obtain an equal amount of rest. A  person retiring at eleven and rising at eight, would probably get no  more rest, possibly less, than a person who should sleep from nine to  five;--a period one hour shorter. But if so, he actually loses an hour  of time a day. And you well know, if Franklin had not told you so, that  _time is money_.    Now, if we estimate the value of this time at ten cents an hour for one  person in four, of the population of the United States--and this is  probably a fair estimate--the loss to an individual in a year, or 313  working days, would be $31.30; and in 50 years $1,565. A sum sufficient  to buy a good farm in many parts of the country. The loss to a  population equal to that of the United States, would, in fifty years,  be no less than five thousand and eighty-six millions of dollars!    But this is not the whole loss. The time of the young and old is beyond  all price for the purposes of mental and moral improvement. Especially  is this true of the precious golden hours of the morning. Think, then,  of the immense waste in a year! At twelve hours a day, more than a  million of years of valuable time are wasted annually in the United  States.    I have hitherto made my estimates on the supposition that we do not  sleep too much, in the aggregate, and that the only loss sustained  arises from the _manner of procuring it_. But suppose, once more, we  sleep an hour too much daily. This involves a waste just twice as great  as that which we have already estimated.    Do you startle at these estimates! It is proper that many of you  should. You have misspent time enough. Awake your 'drowsy souls,' and  shake off your stupid habits. Think of Napoleon breaking up the  boundaries of kingdoms, and dethroning kings, and to accomplish these  results, going through with an amount of mental and bodily labor that  few constitutions would be equal to, with only _four hours of sleep in  the twenty-four_.

In those dark hours, while alien stars were rising and  swinging westward over the masthead, hard, fit, clear-headed young men  talked coolly and with common sense of the big business before them. The  evening consultations were all that we gave to the future. The past was  even less openly recognised; but it proclaimed itself eloquently in the  withered bunches of flowers on this and that cabin table, in the demand  for the ship's notepaper, in the women's trinkets worn by men who, under  ordinary circumstances, would rather wear sack-cloth than jewellery:  emblems, all of them, of thoughts that travelled the white road between  the rudder and the horizon.    In that strange detached world of ours, energy alone was unsuspended. It  was even stimulated, and in a race and class of men not accustomed to  look inward for recreative resources manifested itself in a violent and  unresting pursuit of artificial amusements. In this pursuit all our days  were passed. The morning sun streams into the port-cabins, the diligent  quartermaster brings our toys on deck and gravely arranges them;  throughout the day we play with them until we are tired, when they are  flung aside untidily; again the quartermaster returns, and, like a kind  nurse, puts them away. The sun slants through the starboard windows and  is quenched in the waters; a little talking, a little dancing, a little  music, and we are all asleep. Such were our days. And ever before,  behind, around and beneath us the moving, mysterious sea, wrinkled and  old as the world, but blowing airs of eternal youth from its crumbling  ridges. Down below iron floors stokers and trimmers were sweating,  engineers were watching and nursing and feeding the great steel  bondagers that drove us along; but how many of the light-hearted  passengers ever thought of them? They were out of sight and mind, hidden  away in their stifling holes, where in their relation to us they  completed the satire of our miniature society.    I might give you a dozen pictures of our life, and yet mislead you as to  its uncommonness; it was really commonplace life in strange and  unfamiliar circumstances. Here is an example. At the first concert it  was noticed, not without surprise, that the Captain's name was down for  a song. Now for days the Captain had tramped alone up and down the  deck--a large man, with a heavy face and drooping eye, and a head set  forward on the shoulders by reason of long hours of staring into the  sea dust; a man past middle-age, silent and (as we thought) surly.  Therefore something like a sensation was produced when it was announced  that the Captain would sing \"Mary.\" I think I see and hear it now. The  saloon filled with people; the windows framing faces of deck hands and  firemen, with a background of moving blue; the heavy central figure, the  kindly (we saw that now) Scotch face; the worn voice, unused to  sustained utterance, gasping for breath in the middle of a line, and  sometimes failing to be ready in time (\"I lost the run of it,\" he  explained to us in the middle of a temporary breakdown); the quaint  simplicity of the words, \"Kind, kind and gentle is she, kind is ma  Ma-ary\"; the thunder of applause that greeted the close; the immediate  and unassailable popularity of the Captain. If I have described it as I  saw it, you will understand why I shall always like to remember that  scene. Here is another glimpse.    On a Sunday, when the church bells at home were jangling and the streets  were (for a guess) streaming with rain and mud, it was Sunday with us  also, three thousand miles away. The sun was lighting the lazy sea until  it shone like a big blue diamond, the whales were spouting, the  porpoises plunging and blowing, and here and there a shark lay basking  near the surface with a wicked, wriggling, black fin exposed. It was  very hot and still; the great sea people seemed to be revelling in some  sort of Sabbath of their own, and the waters lay quiet and shining under  the eye of Heaven. Here and there a drove of small flying-fishes rose  and skimmed over the surface like swallows, but they too soon plunged  into the blue and sought below that the cool green depths. Into this  tranquil scene steamed the _Kinfauns Castle_ in a triangle of snow, a  big porpoise rolling and rollicking along beside her, now rising on this  side, now on that. When he came very close he could see into the saloon  windows, and presently he saw the Captain standing at the end of a table  spread with the Union Jack and a great crowd of people sitting round the  tables.    \"Dearly beloved brethren,\" began the Captain, and then the porpoise's  tail came up and his head went down with a \"pflough!\"    When he came up again near enough to see, all the people were muttering  and gobbling over the Psalms, the Captain rolling out his short  alternate verses as though he were directing his own quartermaster on a  course. While the porpoise was very close to the ship and listening hard  the ash-shoot was emptied almost on his head, which scared him so badly  that he dived deep, and did not come up again for a long time. When he  did rise the people were singing, \"On, then, Christian soldiers, on to  victory\"; again he dived, and again came up with a snort, to hear them  singing with equal vigour, \"Make wars to cease and give us peace.\" But  just then the third engineer opened the exhaust of the waste condenser  water, and my black friend got such a shock when the cloud of steam and  hot water burst from the ship's side that he altered his course three  points, and I saw him plunging and rolling away to the west of south.  One thing the porpoise did not hear, for he was below at the time. In  his course through the Liturgy the Captain had reached the Collect for  the day. I will warrant he was trained in a sterner school of theology  than the Anglican; his voice and tones were never meant for the smooth  diction of the Prayer-book; but that is neither here nor there. The  \"Coallect for the fourth Sunday after 'Pithany\" rolled from his tongue.  I never hope to hear it in a more appropriate time or place; there was  something almost startling in the coincidence that brought it round on  such a day, and there was significance in the words--\"_O God, Who  knowest us to be set in the midst of so many and great dangers that by  reason of the frailty of our nature we cannot always stand upright;  grant to us such strength and protection as may support us in all  dangers and carry us through, all temptations._\" Thus prayed the  Captain, the Chief Officer standing beside him; and none knew so well as  those two how many and great were the dangers that lurked in our smiling  environment.    As we drew nearer to our journey's end the desire for news became acute.  At Madeira, on the 24th of January, we heard that the situation in Natal  was practically unchanged, and up to February 3rd we had not seen  another ship pass nearer than five miles. But then it was thought  probable that we should meet the _Dunottar Castle_ on her way home, and  a bright look-out was kept. In the afternoon I was up on the bridge  discussing celestial angles with the Chief Officer; we were snoring into  the south-east trade, and the strong sun-warmed wind was a thing to  bathe in; the bridge binoculars diligently swept the sharp blue line of  horizon. Presently the Third Officer put his glass down. \"There she  is,\" said he, \"two points on the starboard bow.\" We all looked, and we  saw the tiny smear of smoke on the line. How strange it was; both of us  coming up from nowhere and meeting on this roadless waste! In a quarter  of an hour we raised her masts and funnel, and then we perceived it was  not the _Dunottar_. Our course was altered two points, and the three of  us stood up there in the wind and sun watching the growing speck. Down  below they had just seen her, and glasses were levelled by the hundred.  In a little while we could see a red cross on her bow, and we made her  out to be a hospital ship carrying home wounded--Buller's wounded, we  said, from the Tugela fight.    \"BWF, HLF, WBQ,\" fluttered out our signal flags in a bravery of scarlet  and blue and white, which is, being interpreted, \"What news since the  24th?\"    She was abeam now, a mile away; how slow they were in running up an  answer! We pictured their signal quartermaster racking the pigeon-holes  to spell \"Ladysmith,\" and expected a gaudy display. Presently the  coloured stream blew out from her main topmast stay. Only four flags!    \"DFPC,\" reported the Third Officer, and there was a scramble for the  Code-book. \"Nothing important since last accounts.\"    Could anything be more exasperating? We ran up another question, I do  not know what, but we waited in vain for the answering flutter, and the  hospital ship _Princess of Wales_ rolled along on the blue swell.    \"South by east-a-half-east,\" snapped the Chief Officer; the wheel spun  and the steering engine hissed, and the _Kinfauns Castle_ drove her stem  into it again, while from the promenade deck rose the sound of many  voices.    And so we went driving along again through a wonderful sea of deep blue  rollers jousting on a grey ground. It did not yet appear where we should  go or what would be our lot; to-night or to-morrow we should know; but  to-day it was enough that the sun shone and that the waters were wide.          V    SCENES AT CAPE TOWN      When at last the _Kinfauns Castle_ carried us on a sunny evening out of  blue emptiness into Cape Town harbour and dumped us down on dry land,  about thirty of us who were on our way to the front took elaborate  farewells--only to meet again twelve hours later in the vestibule at  headquarters.    No one was in the least excited by our arrival. If we were special  service men, we were told that there were no instructions for us, and  that we had better turn up three or four times a day and look at the  order-board."]]]
