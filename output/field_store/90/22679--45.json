Then he stuck leaves into the resin and  again went to the drinking place.    The tiger saw him, but as the tiger expected to see the leaves come  off just as soon as the monkey got into the water, he thought he would  wait and catch him in his bare skin. This time the leaves did not come  off, for the resin held them fast and was not in the least affected by  the water. The tiger thought that it was not the monkey and that he  must have made a mistake. The monkey drank all he wished and then  strolled away leisurely without the tiger's attacking him. He used the  resin and leaves every time he wanted a drink after that. He kept up  the trick until the rainy season arrived and he could find plenty of  water in other places than the big drinking place.          XI    How the Monkey Got Food    When He Was Hungry      Once upon a time the monkey was hungry. He wanted to make some  porridge, but he did not have any money to buy meal to make the  porridge. So he went to the house of the hen to borrow some meal. The  hen gave him some meal.    \"Come to my house to-morrow at one o'clock,\" he said to the hen, \"I'll  pay back the meal then.\"    Then the monkey went to the house of the fox and said, \"O, friend fox,  please lend me some meal. Come to my house to-morrow at two o'clock  and I'll pay you then.\" The fox gave him some meal.    Then the monkey went to the house of the dog and said, \"O, friend dog,  please lend me some meal. Come to my house to-morrow at three o'clock  and I'll pay you back then.\" The dog gave him some meal.    Then the monkey went to the house of the tiger and said, \"O, friend  tiger, please lend me some meal. Come to my house to-morrow at four  o'clock and I'll pay you back then.\" The tiger gave the monkey some  meal.    The monkey went home and made a great pot of porridge. He feasted and  feasted until he couldn't eat any more, but there was still plenty of  porridge left in the pot. Then the monkey made his bed and took care  to fix it high up from the floor.    The next day, at midday, he ate some more of the porridge. Then he  bound a cloth about his head and went to bed pretending that he was  sick.    At one o'clock the hen came and knocked at the door. The monkey in a  low, weak voice asked her to enter. He told her how very sick he was  and the hen was very sorry for him.    At two o'clock the fox came and knocked at the door. The hen was  frightened almost to death. \"Never mind,\" said the monkey, \"you can  hide here under my bed.\"    The hen hid under the monkey's bed and the monkey in a weak, low voice  invited the fox to enter. The monkey told the fox how very ill he was  and the fox was very sorry for him.    At three o'clock the dog came and knocked at the door. The fox was  frightened almost to death. \"Never mind,\" said the monkey; \"hide here  under my bed and everything will be all right.\"    The fox hid under the monkey's bed and the monkey, in a low, weak  voice, invited the dog to enter. The monkey told the dog how very sick  he was and the dog was very sorry for him.    At four the tiger came and knocked at the door. The dog was frightened  almost to death. \"Never mind,\" said the monkey. \"Hide here under my  bed and everything will be all right.\"    The dog hid under the monkey's bed. Then the monkey invited the tiger  to enter. He told, the tiger how very sick he was but the tiger was  not at all sorry for him. He sprang at the bed, demanding in a loud,  fierce voice that the monkey pay back the meal at once, as he had  promised to do. The monkey escaped to the tree tops, but the bed broke  down under the tiger's weight.    Then the fox ate up the hen and the dog ate up the fox and the tiger  ate up the dog. The tiger is still trying to catch the monkey.          XII    Why the Bananas Belong to    the Monkey      Perhaps you do not know it, but the monkeys think that all the bananas  belong to them. When Brazilian children eat bananas they say, \"I am a  monkey.\" I once knew a little boy in Brazil who was very, very fond of  bananas. He always said, \"I am _very much_ of a monkey.\" If you are  fond of bananas the Brazilian children would tell you that you are a  monkey, too. This is the story they tell to show us how it all came  about.    Once upon a time when the world had just been made and there was only  one kind of banana, but very many kinds of monkeys, there was a little  old woman who had a big garden full of banana trees. It was very  difficult for the old woman to gather the bananas herself, so she made  a bargain with the largest monkey. She told him that if he would  gather the bunches of bananas for her she would give him half of them.  The monkey gathered the bananas. When he took his half he gave the  little old woman the bananas which grow at the bottom of the bunch and  are small and wrinkled. The nice big fat ones he kept for himself and  carried them home to let them ripen in the dark.    The little old woman was very angry. She lay awake all night trying to  think of some way by which she could get even with the monkey. At  last she thought of a trick.    The next morning she made an image of wax which looked just like a  little black boy. Then she placed a large flat basket on the top of  the image's head and in the basket she placed the best ripe bananas  she could find. They certainly looked very tempting.    After a little while the biggest monkey passed that way. He saw the  image of wax and thought that it was a boy peddling bananas. He had  often pushed over boy banana peddlers, upset their baskets and then  had run away with the bananas. This morning he was feeling very  good-natured so he thought that he would first try asking politely for  the bananas.    \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy,\" he said to him, \"please give me a  banana.\" The image of wax answered never a word.    Again the monkey said, this time in a little louder voice, \"O, peddler  boy, peddler boy, please give me a banana, just one little, ripe  little, sweet little banana.\" The image of wax answered never a word.    Then the monkey called out in his loudest voice, \"O, peddler boy,  peddler boy, if you don't give me a banana I'll give you such a push  that it will upset all of your bananas.\" The image of wax was silent.    The monkey ran toward the image of wax and struck it hard with his  hand. His hand remained firmly embedded in the wax.    \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy, let go my hand,\" the monkey called out.  \"Let go my hand and give me a banana or else I'll give you a hard,  hard blow with my other hand.\" The image of wax did not let go.    The monkey gave the image a hard, hard blow with his other hand. The  other hand remained firmly embedded in the wax.    Then the monkey called out, \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy, let go my  two hands. Let go my two hands and give me a banana or else I will  give you a kick with my foot.\" The image of wax did not let go.    The monkey gave the image a kick with his foot and his foot remained  stuck fast in the wax.    \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy,\" the monkey cried, \"let go my foot. Let  go my two hands and my foot and give me a banana or else I'll give  you a kick with my other foot.\" The image of wax did not let go.    Then the monkey who was now very angry, gave the image of wax a kick  with his foot and his foot remained stuck fast in the wax.    The monkey shouted, \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy, let go my foot. Let  go my two feet and my two hands and give me a banana or else I'll give  you a push with my body.\" The image of wax did not let go.    The monkey gave the image of wax a push with his body. His body  remained caught fast in the wax.    \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy,\" the monkey shouted, \"let go my body!  Let go my body and my two feet and my two hands or I'll call all the  other monkeys to help me!\" The image of wax did not let go.    Then the monkey made such an uproar with his cries and shouts that  very soon monkeys came running from all directions. There were big  monkeys and little monkeys and middle-sized monkeys. A whole army of  monkeys had come to the aid of the biggest monkey.    It was the very littlest monkey who thought of a plan to help the  biggest monkey out of his plight. The monkeys were to climb up into  the biggest tree and pile themselves one on top of another until they  made a pyramid of monkeys. The monkey with the very loudest voice of  all was to be on top and he was to shout his very loudest to the sun  and ask the sun to come and help the biggest monkey out of his  dreadful difficulty.    This is what all the big-sized, little-sized, middle-sized monkeys  did. The monkey with the loudest voice on top of the pyramid made the  sun hear. The sun came at once.    The sun poured his hottest rays down upon the wax. After a while the  wax began to melt. The monkey was at last able to pull out one of his  hands. The sun poured down more of his hottest rays and soon the  monkey was able to pull out his two hands. Then he could pull out one  foot, then another, and in a little while his body, too. At last he  was free.    When the little old woman saw what had happened she was very much  discouraged about raising bananas. She decided to move to another  part of the world where she raised cabbages instead of bananas. The  monkeys were left in possession of the big garden full of banana  trees. From that day to this the monkeys have thought that they own  all the bananas.          XIII    How the Monkey Escaped    Being Eaten      Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, people ate fruits and nuts. Then  there came a time when the fruits and nuts became scarce. People had  to eat meat. So they began killing the various beasts to see which  ones were the best to eat. They skinned them and cut them in pieces  and cooked them over the fire. Some of the beasts were good to eat and  others were not good at all.    The ox was found to be very good, and so was the sheep, and the  armadillo. Then one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24717"],[0,"Danger! A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#7)"],[1,"s, and curiosity seekers came from all parts  of the city to witness the really laughable and, in many cases,  meritorious character-sketches given within its damp walls. It was  subsequently broken up by the police.    Boys and girls appear to be alike in one respect--the streets of the  city are full of them at all hours of the day and night. The water,  however, would appear to act like a magnet upon the needle, having  peculiar attractions for them at all times, and to which vicinity, at  night in summer, they naturally gravitate. On the piers which jut out  into the rivers on all sides of the city, any one can see troupes of  gamins every warm, pleasant day. Some are fishing, others are pitching  pennies, others, again, playing various apparently harmless games, but  all with eyes for the main chance--an opportunity to steal anything  come-at-able. To the policeman who, from curiosity or to get a sniff of  sea breeze, chances to stroll upon the pier, he finds them all engaged  as described. Ships are unloading cargoes of assorted merchandise, which  is being placed upon the dock. Bags of coffee are in one place, chests  of tea in another, hogsheads of molasses and sugar, and various other  kinds of goods are distributed all over the place. Some boys are playing  \"tag,\" and they run around and over the bags of coffee, behind the  hogsheads of sugar, ostensibly in play, but all the while keeping a  sharp eye on the watchmen, police and people employed there. A favorable  chance occurring, a boy drops behind one of the bags of coffee and  quickly and expeditiously rips it open with a sharp knife and bounds  away. The coffee thus loosened freely discharges itself upon the dock in  a little heap. In like manner a knot in the wood forming a head in a  barrel of sugar is knocked out, leaving a round hole, into which the  Arab thrusts a long, thin stick and, dexterously withdrawing it,  contrives to pull out considerable sugar. The bung of a molasses barrel  is burst in, a stick inserted, which, when pulled out, has some of the  contents thickly adhering to it. Thus much accomplished, every boy  provides himself with an old tomato or other can, and it would surprise  anyone not familiar with these things, to see how rapidly and  ingeniously these dock rats will fill those cans to overflowing with all  kinds of goods, from the openings thus made in the vessel containing  them.    These same tactics are employed by the street gamins in front of those  grocery stores where barrels, boxes and cases are placed upon the  sidewalk, and it is almost an impossibility for any one but the sharpest  to catch them thus stealing, so clever and adroit are they. One of their  very neat tricks is for a boy to place himself in view of the proprietor  of a store, who, knowing the youth is after some of the goods outside,  keeps a sharp eye on him. Suddenly, the boy makes a dash for some  oranges and flies up the street, the proprietor in full chase. At the  distance of, perhaps, half a block, the boy stops, allowing himself to  be caught, when the irate shopkeeper roughly clutches him and, looking  for the oranges stolen, is considerably chopfallen to find the boy has  taken nothing. Upon being asked why he run away, the boy says he  \"thought he saw his brother and ran after him to speak to him.\" It seems  plain enough, and the grocery man returns to find that, in his absence,  twenty boys have plenteously helped themselves to everything within  reach. It is now too late to re-catch the boy that he first ran after.  It is a piece of strategic cleverness that rarely fails to succeed; and  if any one underrates the _finesse_ of the street Arabs of New York, he  will stand a very good chance some day of being a sufferer from them.    The operations of these embryo professionals are not confined to any one  kind of theft. They are adepts in all the ways of petty thieving.  Sometimes, a drunken sailor or 'longshoreman will stagger out of a  saloon and, unsteadily navigating along, will fall, or seat himself on a  door-step and, either falling asleep or into a semi-conscious condition,  will be surrounded by a gang of these playful boys, while one, the  leader, probably, will sneak up to the unlucky man and relieve him of  all he has about him, when they will scamper off.    These boys are often taken in hand by professional burglars, who use  them to keep watch, posting one of them as a sentry, perhaps employing  another to squeeze through some small aperture and open the doors of the  place to be burglarized, for the fact of their whole lives being passed  upon the streets their education is of that character which tends to  make them quick, bright, smart and skillful in all things, and, when  added to natural gifts of intelligence, render them very dangerous as  thieves or thieves' assistants. Readers of Charles Dickens will recall,  in this connection, the use to which burglar Bill Sykes applied little  Oliver Twist.    Many of these gamins have houses under the docks. The floor is laid just  above high-water mark. It is boarded in on all sides with lumber stolen,  day by day, from adjoining yards. Here they pass their leisure time in  comparative safety and quiet, and considerable comfort, as the whole  gang contribute to furnishing up the club-rooms. Stoves, chairs, tables,  benches, and other evidences of taste, are to be found there, and an  occasional cheap picture, circus bill or flash theatrical poster  ornaments the sides of this not uncomfortable place. Here the members  play cards, dice and other games, drink beer, smoke and otherwise enjoy  themselves. These houses sometimes exist for years unknown to the  police, and many a boy, detected in the commission of some petty theft,  has run along the pier, pursued by the policeman, when, suddenly  scrambling over the pier, he has disappeared, leaving the wondering  officer to guess what had become of him.    In some portions of the town, garrets are made use of as club-rooms and  places of rendezvous, and are exceedingly well arranged. These places  are used as storehouses, too, for the safe-keeping of stolen articles of  all kinds.    An instance of the daring and ingenuity of these \"wharf rats,\" as well  as an illustration of some of their methods, is furnished in the  following: Procuring a boat--loaned frequently with the owner's  knowledge of what it is to be used for--these boys will row, with  muffled oars, under some dock having valuable goods upon it. The only  sound that disturbs the silence of the night is the dull splash, splash  and swish of the waters against the dock or some vessel moored there.  Everything is quiet, while the night watchman slowly paces along his  narrow beat, at the one end of which are the dancing, moonlit waters and  at the other the sleeping city. A favorable chance offering, the heads  of the boys appear above the string-piece, and a bag or sack is  hurriedly lowered into the boat. Other goods follow until, sufficient  having been taken, the boat moves off as silently as it appeared.  Sometimes, a boat is rowed under the pier where barrels of whisky or  other spirits lie, and, by inserting an auger between the planks of the  dock, a hole is bored in the barrel, when the liquor which escapes is  guided into a barrel. In this way many goods are stolen right under the  noses, apparently, of the watchmen and guardians.    Sometimes these wharf rats are captured in the act, when fierce fights  ensue. They know there is no escaping punishment, and they fight  desperately. Having no homes or parents there is no escape for them,  for, even if not convicted of the theft, they must go to the House of  Refuge.    After all, but little blame can be attached to these unfortunate boys  and girls, for they are just precisely what their associations have made  them. They learn to swear, smoke, chew, steal, before they can walk, and  grow up to be what they are. The House of Refuge only serves to confirm  them in their viciousness and evil propensities by herding them with  other criminals; so that, by the time they are released they are ready  and willing to take greater chances in securing larger results, when the  end invariably is the State prison--probably for life.        CHAPTER IV.    STORE GIRLS.    _Their Fascinations, Foibles and Temptations._    Since the time when Mary Rogers, the beautiful cigar girl of Broadway,  met her sad fate over in Hoboken, the pretty shop girls of New York have  contributed more than their full quota to the city's contemporaneous  history. They have figured in connection with many of its social  romances and domestic infelicities, as well as with its scandals and its  crimes--secret and revealed. In Gotham's grave and gay aspects--in its  comedy, its tragedy, and its melo-drama, we are perpetually running  across the charming face, graceful form, and easy, gay demeanor of the  pretty shop girl.    As a rule, the temptress of the store is pretty--frequently quite  beautiful, and almost invariably handsomer than those fortunate  daughters of Mammon whom she is called upon to serve, and who often  treat her with such top-lofty hauteur. And how stylish she frequently  is, and how difficult it is to describe this incommunicable quality of  _style_, which those artful setters of baits--the dealers in ready-made  fabrics--understand so well! Who has not noticed how the tall,  slender-framed girls, with their graceful movements and flexible spines,  their long, smooth throats and curved waists, are drafted off to stand  as veritable decoy-ducks? Who has not observed the grace and ease with  which they wear risky patterns and unusual _facons_, and so delude the  arrogant but ungraceful customer into buying, in the belief that she  will look just as well as the pretty model? The average well-to-do  woman, with some pretensions to good looks, sees a beautiful young  creature with Junoesque air parading before her in bold  color-"]]]
