The government raised six thousand \"gardes du  corps,\" troops of musketeers and light horse, \"gendarmes de la garde,\"  &c. who scandalized Paris, and disgusted the army by their new  epaulettes, and their sumptuous and splendid uniforms. Lastly, the  government, led on by its innovating madness, did not respect those  veterans whom Death had spared on the field of battle. Without pitying  age or infirmities, the ministers, using their accustomed pretext of  economy, withdrew the benefactions which a grateful nation had  bestowed upon two thousand five hundred of these objects of  compassion.    Since the ministers did not dread giving public offence to the army,  and in matters where the offence would be felt most acutely,--since  they refused to recognize both its services and its rights, it may be  easily supposed that the military were disgusted and oppressed when  they appeared before the ministry as individuals. It is not intended  to detail the complaints and accusations which then justly abounded;  but one fact may be stated as giving a double illustration of the  spirit which prevailed.    General Milhaud had distinguished himself in the course of our  national wars, by success and bravery. At the time when France was  invaded by the allies, he \"covered himself with glory\" at the head of  a handful of dragoons, who cut a considerable corps of the enemy's  troops entirely to pieces. This officer, in consequence of his rank,  his standing, and his services, had been appointed a chevalier de St.  Louis as a matter of right; but at the moment of his reception, the  cross was taken from him with ignominy, because he had been so  unfortunate as to vote for the death of the King twenty years before.    Louis XVIII., when he returned to France, had promised that he would  not inquire into the votes which had been given against his august  brother. This promise, which had been demanded from him, and which he  ratified by his charter, could not be otherwise than a painful victory  over the feelings of his heart. He must have grieved when he found  himself under the necessity of admitting those judges into his court,  who had condemned Louis XVI. to the scaffold, and to present them to  the daughter of the murdered monarch. But still he had sworn not to  avenge his death, and the oaths by which a monarch binds himself to  his people should be inviolable.    All resentment was to be repressed. The voters had been pardoned, and  therefore the government could not be justified in reviving the memory  of their crime, and in bringing down vengeance and death upon their  heads. A funeral veil ought to have been drawn over that period of our  revolution, during which we were all equally misled or guilty.  Besides, we must state plainly and distinctly, that the grief excited  by the murder of Louis XVI., was not the true cause of the invectives  with which the regicides were assailed by the emigrants. Unfortunately  the effect produced at Coblentz by the trial and execution of the  king, is too well known. If the errors of some of the men of the  revolution were hunted out with so much malignant zeal, it was only  for the purpose of coming to this result--that as the revolution was  the work of crime, it was necessary to root out every thing which had  proceeded from the revolution.    The insult to which General Milhaud was subjected, was therefore  rather a political movement, than a punishment inflicted on an  individual. In selecting Milhaud as the object of the first assault  against the regicides, the government gave a proof of their want of  tact; for if they wanted to render the regicides contemptible or  odious, they should have avoided attacking an officer who had long  since washed away the stains of the blood of his King, by imbruing  himself in the blood of our enemies!    But whilst the military, from the highest to the lowest, were exposed  to the persecution and tyranny of the prevailing faction, the  magistracy, and the civil functionaries of the state, suffered no less  from ill treatment and injustice. Commissioners had been despatched  into the departments, even at the beginning of the new reign, \"in  order to consolidate the royal government, and to examine into the  conduct of the public functionaries under existing circumstances;\"  that is to say, at the moment of the restoration of the Bourbons.    Such was the confidence which the nation placed in the promises of the  King, that no jealousy was excited by this measure. On the contrary,  people expected that great good would result from it, that party heat  would be allayed, and public interest and opinion become more speedily  united to the throne.    This pleasing illusion was soon dispelled. A great number of  emigrants, who had just come in again, were appointed commissioners.  Instead of listening to cool and experienced advisers, they gave  themselves up to the priests and nobles who beset them, and who were  neither moderate nor enlightened.    The middling classes, who, from their habitual intercourse with the  lower orders, possess so great an influence over the body of the  people, were considered by the commissioners as a rabble multitude of  upstart \"_roturiers_.\" They treated the middling class with disdain  and contempt. Deceived by the recollection of the excesses of the  revolution, they fancied, that whoever could win the populace, became  the ruler of the country. When money is not to be had, the surest way  of getting over the multitude, is by appealing to its passions. They  therefore announced, that they were sent to do justice to the people,  to listen to their complaints, to reform abuses, and to abolish the  \"_droits reunis_,\" and the conscription.    Meetings were announced in the villages and in the country towns. All  persons of respectability kept away; but the populace, who are always  delighted with uproar and novelty, crowded in. There was no end to the  preposterous charges which were preferred against the magistrates, the  prefects, the under-prefects, the mayors, the administrators of  public affairs, the officers of revenue; in short, none of the  depositaries of public authority were spared.    Instead of despising such accusations, or submitting them to an  impartial inquiry, the commissioners hailed the popular clamour with  transport. They triumphed in the tumult; they were overflowing with  happiness at the fancied success of their efforts; they continued  exclaiming with increasing joy, \"that is right, Good People; the King  is your father; these fellows are nothing but _canaille_; upon our  word of honour, we will kick them out.\"    These promises were kept. The public officers and functionaries of all  classes were gradually dismissed, and their places given to informers,  or to the old nobility. As the common people cooled, they became  undeceived, and it was found that they had gained neither in riches  nor in loyalty. The commissioners, instead of adding as they expected  to the popularity of the government, only helped to cry it down. The  cause of royalty was compromised by the scenes of riot which they  encouraged, and they degraded it by acts of injustice and oppression.  The non-emigrant commissioners acted far otherwise. They knew how to  value the lying declamations of the nobles, and of the mob whom the  nobles had set on. From the different conduct pursued by each party,  effects resulted which exhibited the most striking contrast. In one  department the public functionaries retained their situations, in  another they were disgraced and vituperated.    These scandalous proceedings excited the general indignation of the  country. The government was universally blamed. The important task of  instituting inquiries, which were to affect the honour and the civil  existence of the most respectable characters, had been entrusted to  emigrants who had lived amongst strangers during the best part of  their lives. And these men, who knew nothing of the forms, the  principles, or even the faults of the imperial government, were  consequently wholly unable to appreciate the conduct, whether  praiseworthy or blameable, of the depositaries of public authority.    The people discovered that they had been cheated, and that this  measure, disguised by specious representations, was in truth adopted  only for the purpose of more effectually displacing the old  functionaries of the nation. And, lastly, it was evident that this  general dismission would carry off those authorities who were the  natural guardians of every individual who had taken a part in the  revolution. And that all who were thus affected would be placed  beneath the sway of their sworn enemies, the nobles, the priests, and  their adherents.    Indications were given by the government that a \"purification\" of the  courts of justice was in contemplation; and the public apprehension  increased. The independence and immovability of the judges had been  guaranteed to the nation, and this guarantee was certainly the most  valuable of the rights which we had gained. But on account of its  importance, the government were the more desirous of violating it.    When the proposed \"purification\" became known, our national  magistrates trembled in their chairs, and they foresaw that they would  be plucked out for the purpose of making way for the antiquated  survivors of the courts of parliament.    The nation was alarmed, and protested against the measure. But the  \"purification\" was not to be stopped in its swoop. The process began  in the supreme tribunal of the kingdom, the Court of Cassation. And,  to remove all doubts respecting the ulterior object of the government,  it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22352"],[0,"American Boy's Life of Theodore Roosevelt (#7)"],[1,"summer, telling of his experiences while rounding up cattle and while  bringing down waterfowl and larger game of various kinds. He likewise  describes the trained hunters he has met at different seasons of the  year, and tells of what they have done or were trying to do.    At this time his favorite horse was a steed called Manitou. But when on  a round-up of cattle, many ponies were taken along, so that a fresh  mount could be had at any time. It was a breezy, free life, and to it  our President undoubtedly owes the rugged constitution that he possesses  to-day.    His observations led him to make many investigations concerning the  smaller wild animals near his ranches and the larger beasts to be found  farther off. The tales which were told to him by other ranchmen and  hunters he always took \"with a grain of salt,\" and he soon reached the  conclusion that many of the so-styled mighty hunters were only such in  name, and had brought down quantities of game only in years gone by when  such game was plentiful and could be laid low without much trouble. Once  when a man told him he had brought down a certain beast at four hundred  yards, Roosevelt measured the distance and found it to be less than half  that.    \"You couldn't fool him on much,\" said one of the persons who met him  about that time. \"He would take precious little for granted. He wanted  to know the how of everything, and he wasn't satisfied until he did  know.\"    Regarding his own powers as a hunter at that time, Mr. Roosevelt is very  modest. He says his eyesight was rather poor, and his hand not over  steady, so that \"drawing a bead\" on anything was not easy. Yet he went  into the sport with much enthusiasm, and if at times he came back at  nightfall empty-handed, he did not complain, and he was almost certain  to have something interesting to tell of what he had seen.    Theodore Roosevelt had been in this territory before, although not to  remain any great length of time. Once he had come out to hunt buffalo,  no easy thing to do, since this game was growing scarcer every day. He  had a guide named Ferris, who was not particularly struck with the  appearance of the pale young man, plainly dressed, whom he met at the  railroad station.    \"I sized him up as not being able to endure a long trip after a  buffalo,\" said the guide, in speaking afterward of the meeting. \"He was  well mounted, but he looked as if he might play out before the sun went  down.\"    But in this the guide was mistaken. Roosevelt proved that he could ride  as well as anybody. The first night out found the hunters about thirty  miles from any settlement. They went into camp on the open prairie,  tethering their horses with ropes fastened to their saddles, which they  used as pillows.    All went well for an hour or two, when the improvised pillow was jerked  from beneath Theodore Roosevelt's head, and he heard his horse bounding  away in the distance.    \"Wolves!\" cried the guide. \"They have frightened our horses!\"    So it proved; and the hunters lost no time in reaching for their  firearms. But the wolves kept their distance, and soon Theodore  Roosevelt was running after the horses, which, after a good deal of  trouble, he secured and brought back. After that the guide no longer  looked on him as a \"tenderfoot.\"    \"A tenderfoot,\" said he, \"would have been scared to death. But Teddy  Roosevelt was as cool as a cucumber through it all--as if the happening  wasn't in the least out of the ordinary.\"    For several days the hunters remained on the prairie looking for  buffalo, but without success. They were on the point of turning back  when the guide noticed that the horses were growing uneasy.    \"Some big game at hand,\" he announced. \"Come on to yonder washout and  see if I am not right.\"    With great caution the hunters advanced to the washout the guide had  mentioned. Dismounting, they crept forward in the shelter of the  brushwood, and there, true enough, resting at his ease was a great  buffalo bull.    \"Hit him where the patch of red shows on his side,\" whispered the guide,  and Roosevelt nodded to show that he understood. With care and coolness  he took aim and fired, and the buffalo bull leaped up and staggered  forward with the blood streaming from his mouth and nose.    \"Shall I give him another?\" was the question asked, but before it could  be answered the buffalo bull gave a plunge and fell dead.    Rattlesnakes are rather unpleasant reptiles to deal with, and Theodore  Roosevelt has shown his bravery by the way in which he speaks of them in  his accounts of outdoor life. He says to a man wearing alligator boots  there is little danger, for the fang of the reptile cannot go through  the leather, and the snake rarely strikes as high as one's knee. But he  had at least one experience with a rattlesnake not readily forgotten.    He was out on a hunt for antelope. The sage-brush in which he was  concealing himself was so low that he had to crawl along flat on his  breast, pushing himself forward with hands and feet as best he could.    He was almost on the antelope when he heard a warning whirr close at his  side, and glancing hastily in that direction, saw the reptile but a few  feet away, coiled up and ready to attack.    It was a thrilling and critical moment, and had the young hunter leaped  up he might have been dangerously if not fatally struck. But by instinct  he backed away silently and moved off in another direction through the  brush. The rattlesnake did not follow, although it kept its piercing  eyes on the hunter as long as possible. After the antelope stalk was  over, Roosevelt came back to the spot, made a careful search, and,  watching his chance, fired on the rattlesnake, killing it instantly.    In those days Theodore Roosevelt met Colonel William Cody, commonly  known as \"Buffalo Bill,\" and many other celebrated characters of the  West. He never grew tired of listening to the stories these old  trappers, hunters, scouts, and plainsmen had to tell, and some of these  stories he afterward put into print, and they have made excellent  reading.    During many of his hunting expeditions at that time Theodore Roosevelt  was accompanied by his foreman, a good shot and all-round ranchman named  Merrifield. Merrifield had been in the West but five years, but the life  fitted him exactly, and in him Roosevelt the ranchman and hunter found a  companion exactly to his liking, fearless and self-reliant to the last  degree.    As perhaps most of my young readers know, wild geese are generally  brought down with a shot-gun, but in the Bad Lands it was not unusual to  bring them down with a rifle, provided the hunter was quick and accurate  enough in his aim. One morning, just before dawn, Theodore Roosevelt was  riding along the edge of a creek when he heard a cackling that he knew  must come from some geese, and he determined if possible to lay one low.    It was easy work to dismount and crawl to the edge of the creek. But a  fog lay over the water, and he could see the geese but indistinctly.  Leaving the creek bank, he ran silently to where the watercourse made a  turn and then crawled forward in the brush. Soon the fog lifted once  more, and he saw the geese resting on the water close to the bend. He  fired quickly and brought down the largest of the flock, while the  others lost no time in disappearing. It was a good fat goose and made  excellent eating.          CHAPTER VI    GROUSE AND OTHER SMALL GAME--THE SCOTCHMAN AND THE SKUNK--CAUGHT IN A  HAILSTORM ON THE PRAIRIE--BRINGING DOWN BLACK-TAIL DEER      It cannot be said that Theodore Roosevelt's venture as a ranchman was a  very successful one, and it is doubtful if he expected to make much  money out of it. He lost nothing in a financial way, and there is no  doubt but that the experience was of great benefit to him. In this  semi-wilderness he met all sorts and conditions of men, and grew to know  them thoroughly. In the past his dealings had been almost entirely with  people of large cities and towns, and with men of learning and large  business affairs; here he fell in with the wildest kind of cowboys and  frontiersmen. Some he soon found were not fit to be associated with, but  the majority proved as honest and hard-working fellows as could be met  with anywhere. Many of these loved the young \"boss\" from the start, and  when, years later, the war with Spain broke out, and there was a call  to arms, not a few of them insisted upon joining the Rough Riders just  to be near Theodore Roosevelt once more.    Around the ranches owned by Theodore Roosevelt there were more or less  grouse of the sharp-tailed variety. As this sort of game made excellent  eating, ranchmen and regular hunters did not hesitate to bring them down  at every opportunity.    One afternoon Theodore Roosevelt left his ranch to visit the shack of  one of his herders, about thirty-five miles down the river. It was a  cold, clear day, and he was finely mounted on a well-trained pony. He  writes that he was after grouse, hoping to get quite a number of them.    He had trusted to reach the shack long before sundown, but the way was  bad, over bottoms covered with thin ice and snow, and soon darkness came  on, leaving him practically lost in the cottonwoods that lined the  watercourse.    What to do the young ranchman did not know, and it is safe to say that  he wished himself heartily out of the difficulty. It was so dark he  could not see three yards ahead of him, and it was only by the merest  accident that he struck the shack at last, and then he found it empty,  for the herder had gone off elsewhere on business.    So far Roosevelt had seen no game, so he was without food, and what made  matters worse, the larder of the shack proved to be empty. All he had  with him was a little package of tea.    It was a dismal outlook truly, and especially on such a cold night. But  firewood was at hand, and after turning his pony loose "]]]
