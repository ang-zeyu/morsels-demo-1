THE RESULT.--A well written letter has opened the way to prosperity for  many a one, has led to many a happy marriage and constant friendship, and  has secured many a good service in time of need; for it is in some measure  a photograph of the writer, and may inspire love or hatred, regard or  aversion in the reader, just as the glimpse of a portrait often determine  us, in our estimate, of the worth of the person represented. Therefore, one  of the roads to fortune runs through the ink bottle, and if we want to  attain a certain end in love, friendship or business, we must trace out the  route correctly with the pen in our hand.    {37}    [Illustration]    HOW TO WRITE A LOVE LETTER.    1. LOVE.--There is no greater or more profound reality than love. Why that  reality should be obscured by mere sentimentalism, with all its train of  absurdities is incomprehensible. There is no nobler possession than the  love of another. There is no higher gift from one human being to another  than love. The gift and the possession are true sanctifiers of life, and  should be worn as precious jewels without affectation and without  bashfulness. For this reason there is nothing to be ashamed of in a love  letter, provided it be sincere.    2. FORFEITS.--No man need consider that he forfeits dignity if he speaks  with his whole heart: no woman need fear she forfeits her womanly  attributes if she responds as her heart bids her respond. \"Perfect love  casteth out fear\" is as true now as when the maxim was first given to the  world.    3. TELLING THEIR LOVE.--The generality of the sex is love to be loved: how  are they to know the fact that they {38} are loved unless they are told? To  write a sensible love letter requires more talent than to solve, with your  pen, a profound problem in philosophy. Lovers must not then expect much  from each other's epistles.    4. CONFIDENTIAL.--Ladies and gentlemen who correspond with each other  should never be guilty of exposing any of the contents of any letters  written expressing confidence, attachment or love. The man who confides in  a lady and honors her with his confidence should be treated with perfect  security and respect, and those who delight in showing their confidential  letters to others are unworthy, heartless and unsafe companions.    5. RETURN OF LETTERS.--If letters were written under circumstances which no  longer exist and all confidential relations are at an end, then all letters  should be promptly returned.    6. HOW TO BEGIN A LOVE LETTER.--How to begin a love letter has been no  doubt the problem of lovers and suitors of all ages and nations. Fancy the  youth of Young America with lifted pen, thinking how he shall address his  beloved. Much depends upon this letter. What shall he say, and how shall he  say it, is the great question. Perseverance, however, will solve the  problem and determine results.    7. FORMS OF BEGINNING A LOVE LETTER.--Never say, \"My Dearest Nellie,\" \"My  Adored Nellie,\" or \"My Darling Nellie,\" until Nellie has first called you  \"My Dear,\" or has given you to understand that such familiar terms are  permissible. As a rule a gentleman will never err if he says \"Dear Miss  Nellie,\" and if the letters are cordially reciprocated the \"Miss\" may in  time be omitted, or other familiar terms used instead. In addressing a  widow \"Dear Madam,\" or, \"My Dear Madam,\" will be a proper form until  sufficient intimacy will justify the use of other terms.    8. RESPECT.--A lady must always be treated with respectful delicacy, and a  gentleman should never use the term \"Dear\" or \"My Dear\" under any  circumstances unless he knows it is perfectly acceptable or a long and  friendly acquaintance justifies it.    9. HOW TO FINISH A LETTER.--A letter will be suggested by the remarks on  how to begin one. \"Yours respectfully,\" \"Yours truly,\" \"Yours sincerely,\"  \"Yours affectionately,\" \"Yours ever affectionately,\" \"Yours most  affectionately,\" \"Ever yours,\" \"Ever your own,\" or \"Yours,\" are all  appropriate, each depending upon the beginning of the letter. It is  difficult to see any phrase which could be added to them which would carry  more meaning than they {39} contain. People can sign themselves \"adorers\"  and such like, but they do so at the peril of good taste. It is not good  that men or women \"worship\" each other--if they succeed in preserving  reciprocal love and esteem they will have cause for great contentment.    10. PERMISSION.--No young man should ever write to a young lady any letter,  formal or informal, unless he has first sought her permission to do so.    11. SPECIAL FORMS.--We give various forms or models of love letters to be  _studied, not copied_. We have given no replies to the forms given, as  every letter written will naturally suggest an answer. A careful study will  be a great help to many who have not enjoyed the advantages of a literary  education.

Y., May 10th, 1894.    My Dear Miss Lee:    Permit me to explain my failure to keep my appointment with you this  evening.

Sincerely your friend,                    IRVING GOODRICH.    {42}    _8.--Form of an Excuse for a Pupil._    Thursday Morning, April 4th.

With love and best "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23624"],[0,"Ride Proud, Rebel! (#7)"],[1,"n' into anything,\" Drew told the Texan. \"You and Boyd  go on! I'll take Croxton in and see if they'll take care of him.\"    Kirby looked back down the road. \"Don't see no hostile sign heah  'bouts,\" he drawled. \"Guess we can spare us some time to bed him down  proper on th' right range. Maybeso you'll find them in theah as leery of  strangers as a rustler of the sheriff--\"    The Texan's references might be obscure, but he helped Drew transfer  Croxton from the precarious balance in the wounded man's own saddle to  Drew's hold, and then rode at a walking pace beside the scout while Boyd  trailed with the led horse.    There was a pounding of hoofs on the road behind. A half dozen riders  went by the mouth of the land at a distance-eating gallop. In spite of  the dust which layered them Drew saw they were not Union.    \"Them boys keep that gait up,\" Kirby remarked, \"an' they ain't gonna  make it far 'fore their tongues hang out 'bout three feet an' forty  inches. That ain't no way to waste good hoss flesh.\"    \"Got a good hold on him?\" he asked Drew a moment later. At the other's  nod he rode forward into the yard at the end of the lane.    \"Hullo, the house!\" he called.    A man came out of the stable, walking with a kind of hop-skip step. His  blond head was bare, silver fair in contrast to Boyd's corn yellow, and  his features were thin and sharp. It was Jim Dandy, himself.    \"What's all this now?\" he asked in that high voice Drew had last heard  discussing the virtues of rival horse liniments at Red Springs. And he  did not look particularly welcoming.    \"Mr. Dandy--\" Drew walked his horse on, Croxton sagging in his hold, his  weight a heavy pull on his bearer's tired arms--\"do you remember me?  Drew Rennie, of Red Springs.\" He added that quickly for what small  guarantee of respectability the identification might give. Certainly in  his present guise he did not look Alexander Mattock's grandson.    Dandy rested his weight on his good leg and swung his shorter one a  little ahead. And his hand went to the loose front of his white shirt.    \"Now that's a right unfriendly move, suh. I take it right unfriendly to  show hardware 'fore you know the paint on our faces--\"    The smaller man's hand fell away from his concealed weapon, but Kirby  did not reholster the Colt which had appeared through some feat of  lightning movement in his grip.    \"You're not going to take _my_ horses!\" Even if there was no gun in  Dandy's hand, his voice stated a fact they could not doubt he meant.    \"Nobody's takin' hosses,\" the Texan answered. \"This heah soldier's got  him a mighty sore head, an' he needs some fixin'. We ain't too popular  round heah right now, an' he can't ride. So--\"    Boyd pushed up. \"Mr. Dandy, you know me--Boyd Barrett. And this _is_  Drew Rennie. We have Yankees after us. And you never said you were  Union--\"    Dandy shrugged. \"No matter to me what you wear ... blue ... gray--you're  all a bunch of horse thieves, like as not. You, Mr. Boyd, what you doing  riding with these here Rebs? And what's the matter with that man? Got  him a lick on the head, eh? Well--\" he crossed with his lurching walk to  stand by Drew, studying the now unconscious Croxton--\"all right.\" His  voice was angry, as if he were being pushed along a path he disliked.  \"Get him into the stable. I ain't yet took sides in this here bloody  war, and I ain't going to now. But the man's hurt. Unload him and don't  tell me what he's been doing back there to get him that knock. I don't  want to know.\"    He led the way into the stable, and moments later Croxton was as easy as  they could make him on an improvised bed of straw and clean horse  blankets. Dandy turned to them with Croxton's gun belt swinging free in  his hand, still weighted down with two revolvers.    \"You want these?\"    Drew glanced at his two companions. His own carbine was gone; he had  dropped it at the verge of the millpond when he had taken charge of  Croxton. Boyd was without any weapons, and Kirby had only side arms.  Drew started to reach for the belt and then shook his head. If Sam was  able to ride soon, he would need those. And the rest of them could take  their chances at getting more arms. Boyd opened his mouth as if to  protest, but he did not say anything as Drew refused the Colts.    \"You keep 'em--for him.\"    The ex-jockey nodded. \"Better be riding on, Mr. Rennie. They'll come  looking, and I don't fancy having any fight here. With luck we'll get  your friend on his feet all right and tight, and he can slip south when  the dust is down a bit. But you'd better keep ahead of what can come  down the pike now.\"    Kirby moved, the spurs jangling musically on his boots. \"I've been  thinkin' 'bout that theah road,\" he announced. \"Any other trail outta  heah we can take?\"    \"Cross the pasture--\" Dandy directed with a thumb--\"then a cornfield,  and you'll hit the pike again. Cuts off about a mile.\"    \"That sounds right invitin'.\" The Texan led the way back to the yard and  their waiting mounts. \"Obliged to you, suh. Now,\" he spoke to Drew, \"I'd  say it's time to raise some dust. Ain't far to sundown, an' we oughta  git some countryside between us an' them rip-snortin' javalinas--\"    \"Javalinas?\" Drew heard Boyd repeat inquiringly.    \"Kid--\" the Texan reined his bay--\"there is some mean things in this  heah world. Theah is Comanches an' Apaches, an' a longhorn cow with a  calf hid out in a thicket, an' a rattler, what's feelin' lowdown in his  mind. An' theah's javalinas, the wild boars of the Rio country. Then  theah's men what have had to ride fast on a day as hot as this,  swallerin' dust an' thinkin' what they're gonna do when they catch up to  them as they're chasin'; an' those men're 'bout as mean as the boars--\"    Drew lifted his hand to Jim Dandy and followed the other two through the  pasture gate. Now he grinned.    \"You sound like one speakin' from experience--of bein' chased, that is.\"    Kirby chuckled. \"I'm jus' a poor little Texas boy, suh. 'Course we do a  bit of fast ridin'. Mostly though I've been on the other end, _doin'_  the chasin'. An' I know how it feels to eat dust an' git a mite riled  doin' it. I'd say we could maybe help ourselves a bit though.\"    \"How?\" Boyd asked eagerly.    \"You\"--Drew rounded on him--\"can cut cross-country and get home!\" There  was nothing in Boyd's clothing or equipment to suggest that he had been  a part of the now scattered raiders. \"If the Yankees stop you,\" Drew  continued, \"you can spin them a tale about riding out to see the fight.  And Major Forbes's name ought to help.\"    Boyd's scowl was a black cloud on his grimy young face. \"I'm one of  General Morgan's men.\"    \"Only a fool,\" remarked Kirby, \"stops to argue with a mule, a skunk, a  cook, or a boy what's run away to join the army. You figgerin' to take  this kid home personal?\"    \"You'll have to tie me to a horse to do it!\" Boyd flared up.    \"No thanks for your help.\" Drew frowned at Kirby, then turned to Boyd  again. \"No, I can't take you back now. But I'll see that you do go  back!\"    Boyd laughed, high, with a reckless note. \"I'm comin' along.\"    \"As I was sayin',\" Kirby returned to his half suggestion of moments  before, \"we can see 'bout helpin' ourselves. Them Yankees are mighty  particular 'bout their rigs; they carry 'nough to outfit a squad right  on one trooper.\"    Drew had already caught on. \"Stage an ambush?\"    \"Well, now, let's see.\" Kirby looked down at his own gear, then  critically inspected Drew and Boyd in turn. \"We could do with carbines.  Them blue bellies had them some right pretty-lookin' hardware--leastways  them back by the river did. An' I don't see no ration bags on them  theah hosses you two are ridin'. Yes, we could do with grub, an'  rifle-guns ... maybe some blue coats.... Say as how we was wearin' them  we could ride up to some farm all polite an' nice an' maybe git asked in  to rest a spell an' fill up on real fancy eats. I 'member back on the  Ohio raid we came into this heah farm ... wasn't nobody round the place  at all. We sashayed into the kitchen an' theah, jus' sittin' easylike an'  waitin' right on the table, was two or three pies! Ain't had me a taste  since as good as them theah pies. But maybe with a blue coat on us we  could do as well heah 'bouts.\"    There was merit in the Texan's suggestion. Drew, from past experience,  knew that. His only hesitation was Boyd. The youngster was right. Short  of subduing him physically and taking him back tied to his saddle  through the spreading Union web, Drew had no chance of returning Boyd to  Oak Hill. But to lead him into the chancy sort of deal Kirby had  outlined was entirely too dangerous.    \"You mean--we hold up some Yankees and just take their uniforms an'  carbines an' things?\" It was already too late. Boyd had seized upon what  must have seemed to him an idea right out of the dashing kind of war he  had been imagining all these past weeks.    \"It has been done, kid,\" the Texan affirmed. \"'Course we got to find us  two or three poor little maverick blue bellies lost outta the herd like.  Then we cut 'em away from the trail an' reason with 'em.\"    \"That ought to be easy.\" Boyd's enthusiasm was at the boiling point.  \"The Yankees are all cowards--\"    Kirby straightened in his saddle, the lazy good humor gone from his  face.    \"Kid, don't git so lippy 'bout what you ain't rightly learned yet.  Yankees can fight--they can fight good. You saw 'em do that today. And  don't you ever forgit it!\"    Boyd was disconcerted, but he clung doggedly to his belief. \"One of  Morgan's men can take on five Yankees.\"    Drew laughed dryly. \"You saw _that_ happen just this mornin', Boyd. And  what happened? We ran. They fight just as hard and as long, and most of  them just as tough as we do. And don't ever think that the man facin'  you across a gun is any less than you are; maybe he's a little better.  Keep that in mind!\"    \"Yes, you read the aces an' queens in"]]]
