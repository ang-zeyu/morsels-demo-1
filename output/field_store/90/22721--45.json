The question of the speed of the automobile on the roads, in France  and England, as indeed everywhere else, has been the moot point in  all legislation that has been attempted.    The writer thinks the French custom the best. You may legally go at  thirty kilometres an hour, and no more. If you exceed this you do it  at your own risk. If an accident happens it _may_ go hard with you,  but if not, all is well, and you have the freedom of the road in all  that the term implies. In the towns you are often held down to ten,  eight, or even six kilometres an hour, but that is merely a local  regulation, for your benefit as much as for the safety of the public,  for many a French town has unthought-of possibilities of danger in  its crooked streets and unsafe crossings.    Good roads have much to do with the pleasure of automobilism, and  competent control and care of them will do much more. Where a picked  bit of roadway has been chosen for automobile trials astonishing  results have been obtained, as witness the Gordon-Bennett Cup records  of the last six years, where the average speed per hour consistently  increased from thirty-eight miles to nearly fifty-five, and this for  long distances (three hundred and fifty miles or more).    To meet the new traffic conditions the authorities must widen the  roads here and there, remove obstructions at corners, make encircling  boulevards through narrowly laid out towns, and erect warning signs,  like the following, a great deal more numerously than they have as  yet.    They have very good automobile laws in France in spite of their  anomalies. You agree to thirty-seven prescribed articles, and go  through sundry formalities and take to the road with your automobile.  In the name of the President of the Republic and the \"_peuple  francais,_\" you are allowed thirty kilometres an hour in the open  country, and twenty in the towns. You can do anything you like beyond  this--at your own risk, and so long as no accident happens nothing  will be said, but you must pull up when you come to a small town  where M. le Maire, in the name of his forty-four electors, has  decreed that his village is dangerously laid out for fast  traffic,--and truth to tell it often is,--and accordingly you are  limited to a modest ten or even less. It is annoying, of course, but  if you are on a strange itinerary you had best go slow until you know  what trouble lies ahead.    In theory _la vitesse_ is national in France, but in practice it is  communal, and the barriers rise, in the way of staring warnings  posted at each village-end, like the barriers across the roads in the  times of Louis XI.    Except in Holland, where some \"private roads\" still exist, and in  certain parts of England, the toll-gate keeper has become almost an  historical curiosity. It is true, however, that in England one does  meet with annoying toll-bridges and gates, and in France one has  equally annoying _octroi_ barriers.    One recognizes the vested proprietary rights, many of which, in  England, are hereditary, of certain toll-gates and bridges, but it is  hard in these days, when franchises for the conduct of public  services are only granted for limited periods, that legislation, born  of popular clamour, should not confiscate, or, better, purchase at a  fair valuation, these \"rights,\" and make all roads and bridges free  to all.    In France there are no toll-gates or bridges, or at least not many  (the writer recalls but one, a bridge at La Roche-Guyou on the Seine,  just above Vernon), but there are various state ferries across the  Seine, the Rhone, the Saone, and the Loire, where a small charge is  made for crossing. These are particularly useful on the lower Seine,  in delightful Normandy, as there are no bridges below Rouen.    In France one's chief delays on the road are caused by the _octroi_  barriers at all large towns, though only at Paris and, for a time, at  St. Germain do they tax the supplies of _essence_ (gasoline) and oil,  which the automobilist carries in his tanks.    The _octroi_ taxes are onerous enough in all conscience, but it is a  pity to annoy automobilists in the way the authorities do at the  gates of Paris, and it's still worse for a touring automobile to be  stopped at the barrier of a town like Evreux in Normandy, or Tarare  in the Beaujolais. Whatever does the humble (and civil, too) guardian  do it for, except to show his authority, and smile pleasantly, as he  waves you off after having brought you to a full stop at the bottom  of a twisting cobble-stoned, hilly street where you need all the  energy and suppleness of your motor in order to reach the top.    There are not many of these abrupt stops, outside the large towns,  and nowhere do they tax you on your oil or _essence_ except at  Paris--where you pay (alas!) nearly as much as the original cost.    At Rouen the guardian comes up, looks in your tonneau to see if you  have a fish or a partridge hidden away, and sends you on your way  with a bored look, as though he disliked the business as much as you  do. At Tours, if you come to the barrier just as the official has  finished a good lunch, he simply smiles, and doesn't even stop  you. At Marseilles you get up from your seat and let the official  poke a bamboo stick down among your _chambres d'air_, and say  nothing--provided he does not puncture them; if he does, you say a  good deal, but he replies by saying that he was merely doing his  duty, and meant no harm.    At Nantes, at Rennes, at Orleans, and Bordeaux, all of them _grandes  villes_, every one is civil and apologetic, but still the procedure  goes on just the same.    At Lyons the _octroi_ tax has been abolished. Real progress this!    In the old coaching days road speeds fell far behind what they are  to-day in a well-constructed and capable automobile, but, as they put  in long hours on the road, they certainly did get over the ground in  a fairly satisfactory manner. Private conveyances, with private  horses, could not hope to accomplish anything like it, simply because  there is a limit to the working powers and hours of the individual  horse. With the old mail-coaches, in England, and the _malle-poste_  and the _poste-chaise_, in France, things were different, for at  every _poste_, or section, was a new relay; and on the coach went at  the same pace as before.    [Illustration: Days Gone By]    The London-Birmingham coaches in 1830 covered the 109 miles between  the two points at an average speed of 15.13 miles per hour, the  highest speed being eighteen, and the lowest eleven miles.    In France the speeds were a little better. From Lyons the old  mail-coaches used to make the journey to Paris in four days by way of  Auxerre, and in five by Moulins, though the distance is the same, one  hundred and twenty leagues. To-day the automobile, which fears not  hills, take invariably the Moulins road, and covers the distance  between breakfast and dinner; that is, if the driver is a \"scorcher;\"  and there are such in France.    In 1834 there were thirteen great lines of _malle-postes_ in France  as follows:    To Calais. By Clermont, Amiens, and Abbeville.  To Lille. By Senlis, Noyon, St. Quentin, Cambrai, and Douai.  To Mezieres. By Soissons, Reims, and Rhetel.  To Strasbourg. By Chalons-sur-Marne, Metz, and Sarrebourg.  To Besancon. By Troyes and Dijon.  To Lyon. By Melun, Auxerre, Autun, and Macon.  To Clermont-Ferrand. By Fontainebleau, Briare, Nevers, and Moulins.  To Toulouse. By Orleans, Chateauroux, Limoges, and Cahors.  To Bordeaux. By Orleans, Blois, Tours, Poitiers, and Angouleme.  To Nantes. By Chartres, Le Mans, La Fleche, and Angers.  To Brest. By Alencon, Laval, Rennes, and St. Brieuc.  To Caen. By Bonnieres, Evreux, and Lisieux.  To Rouen. By Neuilly-sur-Seine, Pontoise, Gisors, Ecouis, and  Fleury-sur-Andelle.    Besides the _malle-poste_ there was another organization in France  even more rapid. The following is copied from an old advertisement:    AVIS AU PUBLIC  \"_Messageries Royales--Nouvelles Diligences_    \"Le Public est averti:    \"Il partira de Paris toutes les semaines, pour Dunkerque, passant par  Senlis, Compiegne, et Noyon, une diligence le lundi a 6 heures du  matin. Elle repartira de Dunkerque a Paris, le mercredi a 6 heures du  matin. Il partira aussi dans chaque sens une voiture pour les gros  bagages et objets fragiles, le jeudi de chaque semaine.    \"Les bureaux de ces diligences sont etablis a Paris, rue St. Denis,  vis-a-vis les Filles-Dieu.\"    From Paris to Bordeaux, 157 leagues, the Messageries Royales made the  going at an easy pace in five days. To-day the express-trains do it  in six and one-half hours, and the ever-ready automobile has knocked  a half an hour off that, just for a record. \"_Tempus fugit._\"    The subject of roads and roadmaking is one that to-day more than ever  is a matter of deep concern to those responsible for a nation's  welfare.    It might seem, in these progressive days, that it was in reality a  matter which might take care of itself, at least so far as originally  well-planned or well-built roads were concerned. This, however, is  not the case; the railway has very nearly reached the limit of its  efficiency (at any rate in thickly settled parts), and the electric  roads have merely stepped in and completed its functions.    It is certain that an improved system of road administration or  control is needed. The turnpike or the highroad served its purpose  well enough in coaching days as the most direct and quickest way  between important towns. To-day, in many respects, conditions are  changed. Certain centres of population and commercial activity have  progressed at the expense of less fortunate communities, and the  one-time direct highroads now deviate considerably, with the result  that there is often an unnecessary"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26046"],[0,"Bird Stories from Burroughs (#7)"],[1," (August 20) in an oriole's nest suspended from the branch of an  apple-tree near where I write. Earlier in the season the parent birds  made long and determined attempts to establish themselves in a cavity  that had been occupied by a pair of bluebirds. The original proprietor  of the place was the downy woodpecker. He had excavated it the autumn  before, and had passed the winter there, often to my certain knowledge  lying abed till nine o'clock in the morning. In the spring he went  elsewhere, probably with a female, to begin the season in new quarters.  The bluebirds early took possession, and in June their first brood had  flown. The wrens had been hanging around, evidently with an eye on the  place (such little comedies may be witnessed anywhere), and now very  naturally thought it was their turn. A day or two after the young  bluebirds had flown, I noticed some fine, dry grass clinging to the  entrance to the cavity; a circumstance which I understood a few moments  later, when the wren rushed by me into the cover of a small Norway  spruce, hotly pursued by the male bluebird. It was a brown streak and a  blue streak pretty close together. The wrens had gone to housecleaning,  and the bluebird had returned to find his bed and bedding being pitched  out of doors, and had thereupon given the wrens to understand in the  most emphatic manner that he had no intention of vacating the premises  so early in the season. Day after day, for more than two weeks, the male  bluebird had to clear his premises of these intruders. It occupied much  of his time and not a little of mine, as I sat with a book in a  summer-house near by, laughing at his pretty fury and spiteful onset. On  two occasions the wren rushed under the chair in which I sat, and a  streak of blue lightning almost flashed in my very face. One day, just  as I had passed the tree in which the cavity was located, I heard the  wren scream desperately; turning, I saw the little vagabond fall into  the grass with the wrathful bluebird fairly upon him; the latter had  returned just in time to catch him, and was evidently bent on punishing  him well. But in the squabble in the grass the wren escaped and took  refuge in the friendly evergreen. The bluebird paused for a moment with  outstretched wings looking for the fugitive, then flew away. A score of  times during the month of June did I see the wren taxing every energy to  get away from the bluebird. He would dart into the stone wall, under the  floor of the summer-house, into the weeds,--anywhere to hide his  diminished head. The bluebird, with his bright coat, looked like an  officer in uniform in pursuit of some wicked, rusty little street gamin.  Generally the favorite house of refuge of the wrens was the little  spruce, into which their pursuer made no attempt to follow them. The  female would sit concealed amid the branches, chattering in a scolding,  fretful way, while the male with his eye upon his tormentor would perch  on the topmost shoot and sing. Why he sang at such times, whether in  triumph and derision, or to keep his courage up and reassure his mate, I  could not make out. When his song was suddenly cut short, and I glanced  to see him dart down into the spruce, my eye usually caught a twinkle of  blue wings hovering near. The wrens finally gave up the fight, and their  enemies reared their second brood in peace.          THE SONG SPARROW      The first song sparrow's nest I observed in the spring of 1881 was in a  field under a fragment of a board, the board being raised from the  ground a couple of inches by two poles. It had its full complement of  eggs, and probably sent forth a brood of young birds, though as to this  I cannot speak positively, as I neglected to observe it further. It was  well sheltered and concealed, and was not easily come at by any of its  natural enemies, save snakes and weasels. But concealment often avails  little. In May, a song sparrow, which had evidently met with disaster  earlier in the season, built its nest in a thick mass of woodbine  against the side of my house, about fifteen feet from the ground.  Perhaps it took the hint from its cousin the English sparrow. The nest  was admirably placed, protected from the storms by the overhanging eaves  and from all eyes by the thick screen of leaves. Only by patiently  watching the suspicious bird, as she lingered near with food in her  beak, did I discover its whereabouts. That brood is safe, I thought,  beyond doubt. But it was not: the nest was pillaged one night, either by  an owl, or else by a rat that had climbed into the vine, seeking an  entrance to the house. The mother bird, after reflecting upon her ill  luck about a week, seemed to resolve to try a different system of  tactics, and to throw all appearances of concealment aside. She built a  nest a few yards from the house, beside the drive, upon a smooth piece  of greensward. There was not a weed or a shrub or anything whatever to  conceal it or mark its site. The structure was completed, and incubation  had begun, before I discovered what was going on. \"Well, well,\" I said,  looking down upon the bird almost at my feet, \"this is going to the  other extreme indeed; now the cats will have you.\" The desperate little  bird sat there day after day, looking like a brown leaf pressed down in  the short green grass. As the weather grew hot, her position became very  trying. It was no longer a question of keeping the eggs warm, but of  keeping them from roasting. The sun had no mercy on her, and she fairly  panted in the middle of the day. In such an emergency the male robin has  been known to perch above the sitting female and shade her with his  outstretched wings. But in this case there was no perch for the male  bird, had he been disposed to make a sunshade of himself. I thought to  lend a hand in this direction myself, and so stuck a leafy twig beside  the nest. This was probably an unwise interference: it guided disaster  to the spot; the nest was broken up, and the mother bird was probably  caught, as I never saw her afterward.    One day a tragedy was enacted a few yards from where I was sitting with  a book: two song sparrows were trying to defend their nest against a  black snake. The curious, interrogating note of a chicken who had  suddenly come upon the scene in his walk first caused me to look up from  my reading. There were the sparrows, with wings raised in a way  peculiarly expressive of horror and dismay, rushing about a low clump of  grass and bushes. Then, looking more closely, I saw the glistening form  of the black snake, and the quick movement of his head as he tried to  seize the birds. The sparrows darted about and through the grass and  weeds, trying to beat the snake off. Their tails and wings were spread,  and, panting with the heat and the desperate struggle, they presented a  most singular spectacle. They uttered no cry, not a sound escaped them;  they were plainly speechless with horror and dismay. Not once did they  drop their wings, and the peculiar expression of those uplifted palms,  as it were, I shall never forget. It occurred to me that perhaps here  was a case of attempted bird-charming on the part of the snake, so I  looked on from behind the fence. The birds charged the snake and  harassed him from every side, but were evidently under no spell save  that of courage in defending their nest. Every moment or two I could see  the head and neck of the serpent make a sweep at the birds, when the one  struck at would fall back, and the other would renew the assault from  the rear. There appeared to be little danger that the snake could strike  and hold one of the birds, though I trembled for them, they were so bold  and approached so near to the snake's head. Time and again he sprang at  them, but without success. How the poor things panted, and held up their  wings appealingly! Then the snake glided off to the near fence, barely  escaping the stone which I hurled at him. I found the nest rifled and  deranged; whether it had contained eggs or young, I know not. The male  sparrow had cheered me many a day with his song, and I blamed myself for  not having rushed at once to the rescue, when the arch enemy was upon  him. There is probably little truth in the popular notion that snakes  charm birds. The black snake is the most subtle, alert, and devilish of  our snakes, and I have never seen him have any but young, helpless birds  in his mouth.           *       *       *       *       *    If one has always built one's nest upon the ground, and if one comes of  a race of ground-builders, it is a risky experiment to build in a tree.  The conditions are vastly different. One of my near neighbors, a little  song sparrow, learned this lesson the past season. She grew ambitious;  she departed from the traditions of her race, and placed her nest in a  tree. Such a pretty spot she chose, too,--the pendent cradle formed by  the interlaced sprays of two parallel branches of a Norway spruce. These  branches shoot out almost horizontally; indeed, the lower ones become  quite so in spring, and the side shoots with which they are clothed  droop down, forming the slopes of miniature ridges; where the slopes of  two branches join, a little valley is formed, which often looks more  stable than it really is. My sparrow selected one of these little  valleys about six feet from the ground, and quite near the walls of the  house. \"Here,\" she thought, \"I will build my nest, and pass the heat of  June in a miniature Norway. This tree is the fir-clad mountain, and this  little vale on its side I select for my own.\" She carried up a great  quantity of coarse grass and straws for the foundation, just as she  would have done upon the ground. On the top of this mass there gradually  came into shape the delicate structure of her nest, compacting and  refining till its delicate carpet of hairs and threads was reached.
