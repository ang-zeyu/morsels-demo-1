I thought we might use  it for climbing purposes. It is light but strong, and we can lasso a  tree or stump up there with it.\"    \"Hurrah! Sam has solved the problem of how the Rover boys shall rise in  the world!\" exclaimed Tom, gaily. \"Sam, try your skill by all means.\"    \"Show me the tree or stump and I will,\" answered his brother readily.    As well as they were able, they crawled from one part of the hole to a  spot that was somewhat higher. Then they found a projecting rock above  them and Sam threw the noose of his lariat over this.    \"Will it hold?\" queried Dick. \"You don't want to try to climb up and  fall.\"    With caution Sam pulled on the lariat. It held, and he went up hand over  hand, for he was a fair athlete. Then his brothers followed. They now  stood on a ledge of rock, and the top of the hole was still twelve feet  above them.    \"There is a small tree, Sam,\" said Tom, looking upward. \"If you can  lasso that I think we'll be all right.\"    Once more the youngest Rover started to use the lariat. As it swung  upward it missed the tree and swished out of sight over the edge of the  hole.    \"Ouch!\" came the unexpected cry from above. \"Oh, my eye!\"    \"Hullo! you've lashed somebody!\" ejaculated Dick.    \"I didn't know there was anybody up there,\" answered Sam, as the noose  of the lasso slipped downward.    The three Rover boys looked upward. They heard a hasty movement in the  bushes and caught a brief glimpse of a man's face. On the instant the  man disappeared, muttering something to himself.    \"It was Dangler!\" ejaculated Dick.    \"Are you sure?\" asked both of the others, in a breath.    \"Almost positive.\"    Dick had scarcely spoken the last words when down into the hole came a  shower of dirt and stones, shoved over the edge above. The boys were  struck by the stones and got some of the dirt in their eyes. Then down  came a second mass of the same sort.    \"Sto--stop that!\" spluttered Tom, when he could speak. \"Do you want to  kill us?\"    There was no answer, but down came more dirt and stones, until the boys  were almost covered. What to do they did not know, until Dick suggested  they drop from the ledge and seek safety in the cave. As they went down,  a fair-sized rock followed, scraping Tom's shoulder and causing him to  utter a sharp cry of pain.    \"Are you hurt, Tom?\" asked his two brothers.    \"Oh, it isn't much,\" panted Tom. \"But I wish I could get my hands on  that rascal, that's all!\"    \"I am sure now that it must be Dangler,\" said Dick. \"Nobody else around  here would try to injure us. He is mad because we have exposed him. He  must know the officers of the law are looking for him.\"    \"I wish we could catch the rascal,\" muttered Tom.    \"Supposing we climb the mountain from the outside?\" suggested Sam. \"It  is a perfectly clear day and is early yet. We'll know enough to look out  for pitfalls. If we can catch this Dangler the three of us ought to be  able to manage him.\"    \"If we are going to try anything like that we want to hurry,\" returned  Dick. \"He won't remain in this locality long--now he knows he is  discovered.\"    \"Maybe he thinks we didn't see him,\" came from Tom.    \"Well, that will be in our favor. But he'll know somebody will be after  him, for throwing down the dirt and stones.\"    Having eaten a hasty lunch and washed it down with water from a nearby  spring, the three lads began the ascent of the mountain. This was hard  work and caused them to perspire freely.    \"I'm glad I'm not fat,\" said Tom. \"If I was I'd be winded sure.\"    \"I think we'd better keep quiet as soon as we reach the vicinity of the  holes,\" cautioned Dick.    Half an hour of hard climbing brought the boys to the vicinity where  they had first fallen into the holes leading to the cave, and then they  advanced cautiously and in almost absolute silence. They stopped to  listen several times, but heard nothing but the calls of some birds and  the trickling of water over the rocks.    Arriving at the top of the hole from where the dirt and stones had been  thrown, they gazed around with interest. Where the soil was soft they  could see the footprints of shoes much larger than those they themselves  wore.    \"Here is his trail, going away,\" said Dick, after a close examination.    \"There is your tin box!\" cried Sam, pointing to the object, still  dangling from a distant tree.    \"Wait till I see what is in it,\" answered his big brother. \"It won't  take but a minute or two.\"    \"Beware of holes!\" cautioned Tom.    Feeling his way through the brushwood, Dick approached the dangling tin  box. It was a small affair and now hung open. He felt certain in his  mind that when he had seen it before it had been closed.    The box proved to be empty and Dick was, somehow, disappointed. He  glanced on the ground and saw a number of bits of paper, some old  looking and some new. He picked up some of the bits and saw they had  been written on in pencil, but the words or parts of words were  undecipherable.    \"Well, what do you make of it?\" questioned Sam, as he and Tom came up.    \"I think I know what this is,\" answered Dick.    \"What?\"    \"A sort of a private post-office. Somebody was in the habit of leaving  messages here, and Dangler or somebody else got the messages from time  to time.\"          CHAPTER VIII    LAST DAYS ON THE FARM      \"I believe you are right,\" said Tom, after he, too, had looked over some  of the bits of paper strewn around. \"Here is the word 'box' and here is  the word 'Saturday.'\"    \"Yes, and here are the words, 'fast freight,'\" added Sam. \"This was  nothing more than a letter box for the freight thieves.\"    \"But why was it placed here?\" questioned Dick. \"It's a very  out-of-the-way place and hard to get to.\"    \"Maybe somebody had to come this way,\" answered Tom. \"See, here is  something of a trail.\"    \"Yes, and here are those same big footprints!\" exclaimed Sam. \"For all  we know they may lead to some house or hut on the mountainside.\"    Having picked up the majority of the bits of paper and put them in their  pockets for future examination, the three Rover boys followed the path  or trail they had discovered. It led along the mountainside to where  there was a small clearing, backed up by a series of rocks from which a  spring gushed forth, sparkling brightly in the sunshine.    \"I'd like to get another drink,\" said Sam; \"I am terribly thirsty  to-day.\"    \"Wait!\" warned Dick, and caught his youngest brother by the arm.    \"What's up, Dick?\"    \"I see a log cabin--over yonder, among the trees.\"    \"Yes, and I see Dangler!\" yelled Tom, suddenly. \"There he goes, with a  big bundle over his shoulder!\" And he pointed to the rear of the log  cabin. A man was just disappearing behind a fringe of brushwood. The  bundle he carried appeared to be tied up in a horse blanket. He was  running as hard as he could.    For a moment the boys did not know what to do. Then they ran to the  cabin and entered. It contained but one room, and this they soon  discovered was deserted. In the chimney a fire was smouldering, and the  remains of a meal lay scattered over a box that did duty as a table.    \"This must have been Dangler's hangout,\" was Dick's comment. \"He must  have come back for his things.\"    \"Yes, and this explains why the queer letter box was stationed back  there,\" said Tom.    \"Aren't you going to try to catch him?\" asked Sam, impatiently.    \"To be sure,\" answered Dick, and rushed out, and the others after him.    \"Keep back there!\" they heard Dangler cry, as they appeared on the trail  back of the log cabin. \"Keep back, or it will be the worse for you!\"    \"Stop!\" called Dick. \"You might as well give up Dangler; you are bound  to be caught some time.\"    \"Not much! I am armed and I warn you to keep back,\" answered the freight  thief, and then a bend of the trail hid him from view.    \"Do you think he'd dare to shoot?\" asked Tom.    \"There is no telling what a desperate man will do,\" replied Dick. \"We  had better be cautious.\"    After that they advanced with care. Presently the trail came out on a  mountain road and this passed over some rocks and crossed two other  roads. They saw no more of Dangler, and the footprints had disappeared.    \"He has slipped us,\" said Tom, coming to a halt and resting on a fallen  tree. \"Hang the luck anyway!\"    \"He came back to the cabin for his things,\" mused Sam. \"I guess he is  going to leave the neighborhood, and maybe for good.\"    Chagrined over their failure to catch the freight thief, the boys looked  around that neighborhood for awhile and then retraced their steps to the  log cabin. Here they found several old articles of wearing apparel and a  few newspapers.    \"Here is an envelope,\" said Sam, fishing the object out from behind the  box that had done duty as a table. \"It is addressed to William Dangler.  Must have been some letter he got.\"    \"Anything in it?\"    \"No.\"    \"What is the postmark?\"    \"It is almost blurred out,\" said Sam. He took the envelope to the light.  \"Well, I declare! Ithaca!\"    \"Ithaca!\" cried Tom.    \"Why, that's the city we stop at to take the boat for Putnam Hall,\"  exclaimed Dick.    \"I know it.\"    \"This is interesting, to say the least,\" was the comment of the oldest  Rover boy. \"Wonder if Dangler has friends or confederates in Ithaca?\"    \"We must notify the police of this,\" said Tom. \"And the sooner the  better.\"    Satisfied that they could learn nothing more by remaining around the log  cabin, the boys departed, and inside of an hour were on their buckboard  and bound for the farm. From that place they called up the authorities  and informed them of what they had learned. Another search was at once  instituted for Bill Dangler, but the rascal was not captured.    The next day Mr. Anderson Rover came home, and the boys and Randolph  Rover had to acquaint him with all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22168"],[0,"The Golden Spears (#7)"],[1,"thrown out of  his saddle, but he succeeded in regaining his seat. Then on through  the darkness galloped the steed, and when he came into the light the  prince's eyes were for some time unable to bear it. But when he got used  to the brightness he saw he was galloping over a grassy plain, and in  the distance he perceived the hounds rushing towards a wood faintly  visible through a luminous summer haze. The prince galloped on, and as  he approached the wood he saw coming towards him a comely champion,  wearing a shining brown cloak, fastened by a bright bronze spear-like  brooch, and bearing a white hazel wand in one hand, and a single-edged  sword with a hilt made from the tooth of a sea-horse in the other;[5]  and the prince knew by the dress of the champion, and by his wand and  sword, that he was a royal herald. As the herald came close to him the  prince's steed stopped of his own accord.    \"You are welcome, Cuglas,\" said the herald, \"and I have been sent by the  Princess Crede to greet you and to lead you to her court, where you have  been so long expected.\"    \"I know not how this may be,\" said Cuglas.    \"How it has come about I shall tell you as we go along,\" said the  herald. \"The Princess Crede is the Queen of the Floating Island. And it  chanced, once upon a day, when she was visiting her fairy kinsmen, who  dwell in one of the pleasant hills that lie near Tara, she saw you with  the high king and princes and nobles of Erin following the chase. And  seeing you her heart went out to you, and wishing to bring you to her  court, she sent one of her nymphs, in the form of a deer, to lure you  on through the cave, which is the entrance to this land.\"    \"I am deeply honored by the preference shown me by the princess,\" said  Cuglas, \"but I may not tarry in her court; for above in Erin there is  the Lady Ailinn, the loveliest of all the ladies who grace the royal  palace, and before the princes and chiefs of Erin she has promised to  be my bride.\"    \"Of that I know not,\" said the herald; \"but a true champion, like you,  cannot, I know, refuse to come with me to the court of the Princess  Crede.\"    As the herald had said these words the prince and he were on the verge  of the wood, and they entered upon a mossy pathway that broadened out as  they advanced until it was as wide as one of the great roads of Erin.  Before they had gone very far the prince heard the tinkling of silver  bells in the distance, and almost as soon as he heard them he saw  coming up towards him a troop of warriors on coal black steeds. All the  warriors wore helmets of shining silver, and cloaks of blue silk. And  on the horses' breasts were crescents of silver, on which were hung tiny  silver bells, shaking out music with the motion of the horses. As the  prince approached the champions they lowered their spears, and dividing  in two lines the prince and the herald passed between the ranks, and the  champions, forming again, followed on behind the prince.    At last they passed through the wood, and they found themselves on a  green plain, speckled with flowers, and they had not gone far when the  prince saw coming towards him a hundred champions on snow-white steeds,  and around the breast of the steeds were crescents of gold, from which  were hanging little golden bells.[6] The warriors all wore golden  helmets, and the shafts of their shining spears were of gold, and golden  sandals on their feet, and yellow silken mantles fell down over their  shoulders. And when the prince came near them they lowered their lances,  and then they turned their horses' heads around and marched before him.  And it was not long until above the pleasant jingle of the bells the  prince heard the measured strains of music, and he saw coming towards  him a band of harpers, dressed in green and gold, and when the harpers  had saluted the prince they marched in front of the cavalcade, playing  all the time, and it was not long until they came to a stream that ran  like a blue riband around the foot of a green hill, on the top of which  was a sparkling palace; the stream was crossed by a golden bridge, so  narrow that the horsemen had to go two-by-two. The herald asked the  prince to halt and to allow all the champions to go before him; and the  cavalcade ascended the hill, the sunlight brightly glancing on helmet  and on lance, and when it reached the palace the horsemen filed around  the walls.    When at length the prince and herald crossed the bridge and began  to climb the hill, the prince thought he felt the ground moving under  them, and on looking back he could see no sign of the golden bridge,  and the blue stream had already become as wide as a great river, and  was becoming wider every second.    \"You are on the floating island now,\" said the herald, \"and before you  is the palace of the Princess Crede.\"    At that moment the queen came out through the palace door, and the  prince was so dazzled by her beauty, that only for the golden bracelet  he wore upon his right arm, under the sleeve of his silken tunic, he  might almost have forgotten the Princess Ailinn. This bracelet was made  by the dwarfs who dwell in the heart of the Scandinavian Mountains, and  was sent with other costly presents by the King of Scandinavia to the  King of Erin, and he gave it to the princess, and it was the virtue of  this bracelet, that whoever was wearing it could not forget the person  who gave it to him, and it could never be loosened from the arm by any  art or magic spell; but if the wearer, even for a single moment, liked  anyone better than the person who gave it to him, that very moment the  bracelet fell off from the arm and could never again be fastened on. And  when the princess promised her hand in marriage to the Prince Cuglas,  she closed the bracelet on his arm.    The fairy queen knew nothing about the bracelet, and she hoped that  before the prince was long in the floating island he would forget all  about the princess.    \"You are welcome, Cuglas,\" said the queen, as she held out her hand, and  Cuglas, having thanked her for her welcome, they entered the palace  together.    \"You must be weary after your long journey,\" said the queen. \"My page  will lead you to your apartments, where a bath of the cool blue waters  of the lake has been made ready for you, and when you have taken your  bath the pages will lead you to the banquet hall, where the feast is  spread.\"    At the feast the prince was seated beside the queen, and she talked to  him of all the pleasures that were in store for him in fairyland, where  pain, and sickness, and sorrow, and old age, are unknown, and where  every rosy hour that flies is brighter than the one that has fled before  it. And when the feast was ended the queen opened the dance with the  prince, and it was not until the moon was high above the floating island  that the prince retired to rest.    He was so tired after his journey and the dancing that he fell into  a sound sleep. When he awoke the next morning the sun was shining  brightly, and he heard outside the palace the jingle of bells and the  music of baying hounds, and his heart was stirred by memories of the  many pleasant days on which he had led the chase over the plains and  through the green woods of Tara.    He looked out through the window, and he saw all the fairy champions  mounted on their steeds ready for the chase, and at their head the fairy  queen. And at that moment the pages came to say the queen wished to know  if he would join them, and the prince went out and found his steed ready  saddled and bridled, and they spent the day hunting in the forest that  stretched away for miles behind the palace, and the night in feasting  and dancing.    When the prince awoke the following morning he was summoned by the pages  to the presence of the queen. The prince found the queen on the lawn  outside the palace surrounded by her court.    \"We shall go on the lake to-day, Cuglas,\" said the queen, and taking his  arm she led him along the water's edge, all the courtiers following.    [Illustration: \"The queen wished to know if he would join them\"]    When she was close to the water she waved her wand, and in a second a  thousand boats, shining like glass, shot up from beneath the lake and  set their bows against the bank. The queen and Cuglas stepped into one,  and when they were seated two fairy harpers took their places in the  prow. All the other boats were soon thronged by fairies, and then the  queen waved her wand again, and an awning of purple silk rose over the  boat, and silken awnings of various colors over the others, and the  royal boat moved off from the bank followed by all the rest, and in  every boat sat a harper with a golden harp, and when the queen waved her  wand for the third time, the harpers struck the trembling chords, and to  the sound of the delightful music the boats glided over the sunlit lake.  And on they went until they approached the mouth of a gentle river  sliding down between banks clad with trees. Up the river, close to the  bank and under the drooping trees, they sailed, and when they came to  a bend in the river, from which the lake could be no longer seen, they  pushed their prows in against the bank, and the queen and Cuglas, and  all the party, left the boats and went on under the trees until they  came to a mossy glade.    Then the queen waved her wand, and silken couches were spread under the  trees, and she and Cuglas sat on one apart from the others, and the  courtiers took their places in proper order.    And the queen waved her wand again, and wind shook the trees above them,  and the most luscious fruit that was ever tasted fell down into their  hands; and when the feast was over there was dancing in the glades to  the music of the harps, and when they were tired dancing they set out  for the boats, and the moon was rising above the trees as they sailed  away over the lake, and it was not long until"]]]
