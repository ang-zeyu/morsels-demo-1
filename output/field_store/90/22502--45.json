Our clothes was all made of homespun. De women done all de spinning  and de weaving but Miss Betsy cut out all de clothes and helped wid de  sewing. She learned to sew when she was away to school and she learnt  all her women to sew. She done all the sewing for de children. Master  Holmes bought our shoes and we all had 'em to wear in de winter. We  all went barefoot in de summer.    He kept mighty good teams and he had two fine saddle horses. He and  Miss Betsy rode 'em all de time. She would ride wid him all over de  farm and dey would go hunting a lot, too. She could shoot a gun as  good as any man.    Master Holmes sure did love his wife and children and he was so proud  of her. It nearly killed 'em both to give up de little boy and girl. I  never did hear of him taking a drink and he was kind to everybody,  both black and white, and everybody liked him. Dey had lots of company  and dey never turned anybody away. We lived about four miles from de  ferry on Red River on de Texas Road and lots of travelers stopped at  our house.    We was 'lowed to visit de colored folks on de Eastman and Carter  plantations dat joined our farm. Eastman and Carter was both white men  dat married Indian wives. Dey was good to dey slaves, too, and let 'em  visit us.    Old Uncle Kellup (Caleb) Colbert, Uncle Billy Hogan, Rev. John Carr,  Rev. Baker, Rev. Hogue, and old Father Murrow preached for de white  folks all de time and us colored folks went to church wid dem. Dey had  church under brush arbors and we set off to ourselves but we could  take part in de singing and sometimes a colored person would get happy  and pray and shout but nobody didn't think nothing 'bout dat.    De Patrollers was de law, kind of like de policeman now. Dey sure  never did whip one of Master Holmes' niggers for he didn't allow it.  He didn't whip 'em hisself and he sure didn't allow anybody else to  either. I was afraid of de Ku Kluxers too, and I 'spects dat Master  Holmes was one of de leaders iffen de truth was known. Dey sure was  scary looking.    I was scared of de Yankee soldiers. Dey come by and killed some of our  cattle for beef and took our meat and lard out'n de smokehouse and dey  took some corn, too. Us niggers was awful mad. We didn't know anything  'bout dem fighting to free us. We didn't specially want to be free dat  I knows of.    Right after de War I went over to Bloomfield Academy to take care of a  little girl, but I went back to Master Holmes and Miss Betsy at de end  of two years to take care of de little girl dat was born to dem and I  stayed with her until I was about fifteen. Master Holmes went to  Washington as a delegate, for something for de Indians, and he took  sick and died and dey buried him dere. Poor Miss Betsy nearly grieved  herself to death. She stayed on at de farm till her little girl was  grown and married. Her nigger men stayed on with her and rented land  from her and dey sure raised a sight of truck. Didn't none of her old  slaves ever move very far from her and most of them worked for her  till dey was too old to work.    I left Miss Betsy purty soon after Master Holmes died and went back  to de Academy and stayed three years. I married a man dat belonged to  Master Holmes' cousin. His name was Colbert, too. I had a big wedding.  Miss Betsy and a lot of white folks come and stayed for dinner. We  danced all evening and after supper we started again and danced all  night and de next day and de next night. We'd eat awhile and den we'd  dance awhile.    My husband and I had nine children and now I've got seven  grandchildren. My husband has been dead a long time.    My sister, Chaney, lives here close to me but her mind has got feeble  and she can't recollect as much as I can. I live with my son and he is  mighty good to me. I know I ain't long for dis world but I don't mind  for I has lived a long time and I'll have a lot of friends in de other  world and I won't be lonesome.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves  [Date stamp: NOV 5 1937]    GEORGE CONRAD, JR.,  Age 77 yrs.  Oklahoma City, Okla.      I was born February 23, 1860 at Connersville, Harrison County,  Kentucky. I was born and lived just 13 miles from Parish. My mother's  name is Rachel Conrad, born at Bourbon County, Kentucky. My father,  George Conrad, was born at Bourbon County Kentucky. My grandmother's  name is Sallie Amos, and grandfather's name is Peter Amos. My  grandfather, his old Master freed him and he bought my grandmother,  Aunt Liza and Uncle Cy. He made the money by freighting groceries from  Ohio to Maysville, Kentucky.    Our Master was named Master Joe Conrad. We sometimes called him \"Mos\"  Joe Conrad. Master Joe Conrad stayed in a big log house with weather  boarding on the outside.    I was born in a log cabin. We slept in wooden beds with rope cords for  slats, and the beds had curtains around them. You see my mother was  the cook for the Master, and she cooked everything--chicken, roasting  ears. She cooked mostly everything we have now. They didn't have  stoves; they cooked in big ovens. The skillets had three legs. I can  remember the first stove that we had. I guess I was about six years  old.    My old Master had 900 acres of land. My father was a stiller. He made  three barrels of whisky a day. Before the War whisky sold for 12-1/2c  and 13c a gallon. After the War it went up to $3 and $4 per gallon.  When War broke out he had 300 barrels hid under old Master's barn.    There was 14 colored men working for old Master Joe and 7 women. I  think it was on the 13th of May, all 14 of these colored men, and my  father, went to the Army. When old Master Joe come to wake 'em up the  next morning--I remember he called real loud, Miles, Esau, George,  Frank, Arch, on down the line, and my mother told him they'd all gone  to the army. Old Master went to Cynthia, Kentucky, where they had  gone to enlist and begged the officer in charge to let him see all of  his boys, but the officer said \"No.\" Some way or 'nother he got a  chance to see Arch, and Arch came back with him to help raise the  crops.    My mother cooked and took care of the house. Aunt Sarah took care of  the children. I had two little baby brothers, Charlie and John. The  old Mistress would let my mother put them in her cradle and Aunt Sarah  got jealous, and killed both of the babies. When they cut one of the  babies open they took out two frogs. Some say she conjured the babies.  Them niggers could conjure each other but they couldn't do nothing to  the whitefolks, but I don't believe in it. There's an old woman living  back there now (pointing around the corner of the house where he was  sitting) they said her husband put a spell on her. They call 'em  two-headed Negroes.    Old Master never whipped any of his slaves, except two of my  uncles--Pete Conrad and Richard Sherman, now living at Falsmouth,  Kentucky.    We raised corn, wheat, oats, rye and barley, in the spring. In  January, February and March we'd go up to the Sugar Camp where he had  a grove of maple trees. We'd make maple syrup and put up sugar in  cakes. Sugar sold for $2.5O and $3 a cake. He had a regular sugar  house. My old Master was rich I tell you.    Whenever a member of the white family die all the slaves would turn  out, and whenever a slave would die, whitefolks and all the slaves  would go. My Master had a big vault. My Mistress was buried in an iron  coffin that they called a potanic coffin. I went back to see her after  I was 21 years old and she look jest like she did when they buried  her. All of the family was buried in them vaults, and I expect if  you'd go there today they'd look the same. The slaves was buried in  good handmade coffins.    I heard a lot of talk 'bout the patrollers. In them days if you went  away from home and didn't have a pass they'd whip you. Sometimes  they'd whip you with a long black cow whip, and then sometime they'd  roast elm switches in the fire. This was called \"cat-o-nine-tails\",  and they'd whip you with dat. We never had no jails; only punishment  was just to whip you.    Now, the way the slaves travel. If a slave had been good sometimes old  Master would let him ride his hoss; then, sometime they'd steal a hoss  out and ride 'em and slip him back before old Master ever found it  out. There was a man in them days by the name of John Brown. We called  him an underground railroad man, 'cause he'd steal the slaves and  carry 'em across the river in a boat. When you got on the other side  you was free, 'cause you was in a free State, Ohio.    We used to sing, and I guess young folks today does too:        \"John Brown's Body Lies A 'moulding In the Clay.\"    and        \"They Hung John Brown On a Sour Apple Tree.\"    Our slaves all got very good attention when they got sick. They'd send  and get a doctor for 'em. You see old Mistress Mary bought my mother,  father and two children throwed in for $1,100 and she told Master Joe  to always keep her slaves, not to sell 'em and always take good care  of 'em.    When my father went to the army old Master told us he was gone to  fight for us niggers freedom. My daddy was the only one that come back  out of the 13 men that enlisted, and when my daddy come back old  Master give him a buggy and hoss.    When the Yanks come, I never will forget one of 'em was named John  Morgan. We carried old Master down to the barn and hid him in the hay.  I felt so sorry for old Master they took all his hams, some of his  whiskey, and all dey could find, hogs, chickens, and jest treated him  something terrible.    The whitefolks learned my father how to read and write, but I didn't  learn how to read and write 'til I enlisted in the U. S. Army in  1883.    They sent us here (Oklahoma Territory) to keep the immigrants from  settling up Oklahoma. I went to Fort Riley the 1st day of October  1883, and stayed there three weeks. Left Fort Riley and went"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20788"],[0,"Storm Over Warlock (#7)"],[1,"elf, to waver up the scale again.    The wolverines went mad. Shann had witnessed their quick kills in the  wilds, but this stark ferocity of spitting, howling rage was new. They  answered that challenge from the camp, streaking out from under his  hands. Yet both animals skidded to a stop before they passed the first  dome and were lost in the gloom. A spark glowed for an instant to his  right; Thorvald was ready to go, so Shann had no time to try and recall  the animals.    He fumbled for those balls of soaked moss in his leaf bag. The chemical  smell from them blotted out that alien mustiness which the wind brought  from the campsite. Shann readied the first sopping mess in his sling,  snapped his fire sparker at it, and had the ball awhirl for a toss  almost in one continuous movement. The moss burst into fire as it curved  out and fell.    To a witness it might have seemed that the missile materialized out of  the air, the effect being better than Shann had hoped.    A second ball for the sling--spark ... out ... down. The first had  smashed on the ground near the dome of the com station, the force of  impact flattening it into a round splatter of now fiercely burning  material. And his second, carefully aimed, lit two feet beyond.    Another wail tearing at the nerves. Shann made a third throw, a fourth.  He had an audience now. In the light of those pools of fire the Throgs  were scuttling back and forth, their hunched bodies casting weird  shadows on the dome walls. They were making efforts to douse the fires,  but Shann knew from careful experimentation that once ignited the stuff  he had skimmed from the lip of one of the hot springs would go on  burning as long as a fraction of its viscid substance remained  unconsumed.    Now Thorvald had gone into action. A Throg suddenly halted, struggled  frantically, and toppled over into the edge of a fire splotch, legs  looped together by the coils of the curious weapon Thorvald had put  together on their first night of partnership. Three round stones of  comparable weight had each been fastened at the end of a vine cord, and  those cords united at a center point. Thorvald had demonstrated the  effectiveness of his creation by bringing down one of the small \"deer\"  of the grasslands, an animal normally fleet enough to feel safe from  both human and animal pursuit. And those weighted ropes now trapped the  Throg with the same efficiency.    Having shot his last fireball, Shann ran swiftly to take up a new  position, downgrade and to the east of the domes. Here he put into  action another of the primitive weapons Thorvald had devised, a spear  hurled with a throwing stick, giving it double range and twice as  forceful penetration power. The spears themselves were hardly more than  crudely shaped lengths of wood, their points charred in the fire.  Perhaps these missiles could neither kill nor seriously wound. But more  than one thudded home in a satisfactory fashion against the curving back  carapace or the softer front parts of a Throg in a manner which  certainly shook up and bruised the target. And one of Shann's victims  went to the ground, to lie kicking in a way which suggested he had been  more than just bruised.    Fireballs, spears.... Thorvald had moved too. And now down into the  somewhat frantic melee of the aroused camp fell a shower of slim  weighted reeds, each provided with a clay-ball head. The majority of  those balls broke on landing as the Terrans had intended. So, through  the beetle smell of the aliens, spread the acrid, throat-parching fumes  of the hot spring water. Whether those fumes had the same effect upon  Throg breathing apparatus as they did upon Terran, the attackers could  not tell, but they hoped such a bombardment would add to the general  confusion.    Shann began to space the hurling of his crude spears with more care,  trying to place them with all the precision of aim he could muster.  There was a limit to their amount of varied ammunition, although they  had dedicated every waking moment of the past few days to manufacture  and testing. Luckily the enemy had had none of their energy beams at the  domes. And so far they had made no move to lift their flyers for  retaliation blasts.    But the Throgs were pulling themselves into order. Blaster fire cut the  dusk. Most of the aliens were now flat on the ground, sending a creeping  line of fire into the perimeter of the camp area. A dark form moved  between Shann and the nearest patch of burning moss. The Terran raised a  spear to the ready before he caught a whiff of the pungent scent emitted  by a wolverine hot with battle rage. He whistled coaxingly. With the  Throgs eager to blast any moving thing, the animals were in danger if  they prowled about the scene.    That blunt head moved. Shann caught the glint of eyes in a furred mask;  it was either Taggi or his mate. Then a puff of mixed Throng and  chemical scent from the camp must have reached the wolverine. The animal  coughed and fled westward, passing Shann.    Had Thorvald had time and opportunity to make his planned raid on the  supply dome? Time during such an embroilment was hard to measure, and  Shann could not be sure. He began to count aloud, slowly, as they had  agreed. When he reached one hundred he would begin his retreat; on two  hundred he was to run for it, his goal the river a half mile from the  camp.    The stream would take the fugitives to the sea where fiords cut the  coastline into a ragged fringe offering a wealth of hiding places.  Throgs seldom explored any territory on foot. For them to venture into  that maze would be putting themselves at the mercy of the Terrans they  hunted. And their flyers could comb the air above such a rocky  wilderness without result.    Shann reached the count of one hundred. Twice a blaster bolt singed  ground within distance close enough to make him wince, but most of the  fire carried well above his head. All of his spears were gone, save for  one he had kept, hoping for a last good target. One of the Throgs who  appeared to be directing the fire of the others was facing Shann's  position. And on pure chance that he might knock out that leader, Shann  chose him for his victim.    The Terran had no illusions concerning his own marksmanship. The most he  could hope for, he thought, was to have the primitive weapon thud home  painfully on the other's armored hide. Perhaps, if he were very lucky,  he could knock the other from his clawed feet. But that chance which  hovers over any battlefield turned in Shann's favor. At just the right  moment the Throg stretched his head up from the usual hunched position  where the carapace extended over his wide shoulders to protect one of  the alien's few vulnerable spots, the soft underside of his throat. And  the fire-sharpened point of the spear went deep.    Throgs were mute, or at least none of them had ever uttered a vocal  sound to be reported by Terrans. This one did not cry out. But he  staggered forward, forelimbs up, clawed digits pulling at the wooden pin  transfixing his throat just under the mandible-equipped jaw, holding his  head at an unnatural angle. Without seeming to notice the others of his  kind, the Throg came on at a shambling run, straight at Shann as if he  could actually see through the dark and had marked down the Terran for  personal vengeance. There was something so uncanny about that forward  dash that Shann retreated. As his hand groped for the knife at his belt  his boot heel caught in a tangle of weed and he struggled for balance.  The wounded Throg, still pulling at the spear shaft protruding above the  swelling barrel of his chest, pounded on.    Shann sprawled backward and was caught in the elastic embrace of a bush,  so he did not strike the ground. He fought the grip of prickly branches  and kicked to gain solid earth under his feet. Then again he heard that  piercing wail from the camp, as chilling as it had been the first time.  Spurred by that, he won free. But he could not turn his back on the  wounded Throg, keeping rather a sidewise retreat.    Already the alien had reached the dark beyond the rim of the camp. His  progress now was marked by the crashing through low brush. Two of the  Throgs back on the firing line started up after their leader. Shann  caught a whiff of their odor as the wounded alien advanced with the  single-mindedness of a robot.    It would be best to head for the river. Tall grass twisted about the  Terran's legs as he began to run. In spite of the gloom, he hesitated to  cross that open space. At night Warlock's peculiar vegetation displayed  a very alien attribute--ten ... twenty varieties of grass, plant, and  tree emitted a wan phosphorescence, varying in degree, but affording  each an aura of light. And the path before Shann now was dotted by  splotches of that radiance, not as brilliant as the chemical-born flames  the attackers had kindled in the camp, but as quick to betray the unwary  who passed within their dim circles. And there had never been any reason  to believe that Throg powers of sight were less than human; there was  perhaps some evidence to the contrary. Shann crouched, charting the  clumps ahead for a zigzag course which would take him to at least  momentary safety in the river bed.    Perhaps a mile downstream was the transport the Terrans had cobbled  together no earlier than this afternoon, a raft Thorvald had professed  to believe would support them to the sea which lay some fifty Terran  miles to the west. But now he had to cover that mile.    The wolverines? Thorvald? There was one lure which might draw the  animals on to the rendezvous. Taggi had brought down a \"deer\" just  before they had left the raft. And instead of allowing both beasts to  feast at leisure, Shann had lashed the carcass to the shaky platform of  wood and brush, putting it out to swing in the current, though still  moored to the bank.    Wolverines always cached that"]]]
