And I was telling to him, 'I would be seeing if you shall be repeating  these words when you shall be married one year.'  The year was passed but  my friend he don't be saying nothing to me.  Excuse me, I am not so bad  man to ask him.  I found him many times in the street, but he would not  meet me, would not speak.  Oh, no!  And he is not laughing any more.  Not  one friend; fifteen friends, all married.  Never they are telling they  are happy.\"    Having disposed of the question of marriage he told me that Carmelo had  been to see me and would call again.  He had already been several times,  and I was puzzled to know what he wanted.  He could hardly be wanting to  propose an excursion, for I had already made him get leave and take me  for several.  But as, sooner or later, an opportunity must occur for  clearing up the mystery, I left it alone for the present and asked  Peppino, who always knew everything that was going on in the  neighbourhood, what ship it was I had seen coming into the bay and making  for the port.    He said she was the _Sorella di Ninu_, returning from Naples, where she  had been with a cargo of wine.  He knew because she belonged to his  cousin Vanni, who was a wine merchant and, if I would give up a morning's  sketching, he would give up a morning's work, take me down to the port,  introduce me to his cousin and show me over the ship.    Accordingly next morning Carmelo got leave from his padrone and drove us  down the zig-zags among the flowers while Peppino told me about his  cousin.  His father had two brothers, one was the father of Vanni and  used to keep a small wine shop down in the port and Vanni, who had a  voice, studied singing and went on the opera stage.  The other brother  emigrated to America and never married.  Very little was heard of him,  except that he was engaged in some speculative business, until at last  news came of his death.  Had he died six months before, he would have  left nothing, but it happened that the markets were favourable and he  died rich.  After the usual delays, his money came and was divided  between his surviving brothers.  Vanni's father enlarged the wine shop,  bought vineyards and a ship, took his son away from the stage and sent  him to the University.  In course of time he enlarged his business and  took Vanni into partnership.  Peppino's father gave up being sagrestano,  bought vineyards and the Albergo della Madonna (con giardino) and  educated his son.  The part of Peppino's education that was most useful  to him was his two years in England, and that did not cost his father  anything, for he would only take money enough for the journey and all the  time he was away he kept himself and saved, so that he not only repaid  his father and paid for his journey home but had money in the bank.    By this time we had arrived at the quay and Peppino went off to his  uncle's shop for information as to approaching the _Sorella di Ninu_,  leaving me alone with Carmelo.  He seized the opportunity.    \"I have been to see you several times because I wanted to tell you that I  also have been in prison.\"    \"Hullo! Carmelo,\" I said, \"have you been trying to murder your father?\"    \"No,\" he said, \"it was not my father.  It was a friend.  We quarrelled.  I drew my knife and stabbed him in the arm.  It happened last year.\"    I sympathized as well as I could and assured him that it should make no  difference in the relations between us.    Why did I say this?  Why was I so indulgent towards Carmelo and so  implacable to Rosario?  It seems as though an Englishman may also be a  mass of contradictions.  It is true that parricide is perhaps the most  repulsive form that murder can take, but I do not think this had anything  to do with it, for ordinary murder is sufficiently repulsive.  I believe  I was influenced by a conversation we had had during our last expedition;  Carmelo had told me that he intended soon to leave private service, to  marry and go into partnership with Rosario.    \"But, Carmelo,\" I had objected, \"would not that be rather risky?  Don't  you remember that Rosario has been to prison for trying to kill your  father?\"    \"Oh, that all happened a long time ago and Rosario has married and  settled down since then.\"    Evidently Carmelo had thought this over and had felt uncomfortable that I  should shun Rosario for being a jail-bird and not shun him who was one  also.  It seemed to indicate considerable delicacy of feeling on his part  and I was pleased with him for taking so much trouble to get the  confession off his chest.  Whereas Rosario had treated his disgrazia as  merely an annoying little accident that might happen to any gentleman.    Peppino returned, stood on the quay and shouted to the ships; presently a  small boat containing Vanni and a sailor detached herself from the  confusion and rowed to our feet.  I was introduced and, amid the usual  compliments, we took our seats and glided past the _Sacro Cuore_, the  _Due Sorelle_, the _Divina Provvidenza_, the _Maria Concetta_, the  _Stella Maris_, the _La Pace_, the _Indipendente_, the _Nuova Bambina_  and many more.  Peppino called my attention to the names of the ships and  said how commonplace and dull they were after the romantic names he had  seen on the beach at Brighton.  He gave, as an instance, _Pride of the  Ocean_, which I remembered having often seen there; it was all very well,  but somehow it had never impressed me as hitting the bull's-eye of  romance.  During their voyage through time the words of one's own  language become barnacled over with associations so that we cannot see  them in their naked purity as we see the words of a foreign tongue.  I  translated _Pride of the Ocean_ into _Vanto del Mare_ and offered it to  Peppino; it seemed to me to gain, but he said I had knocked all the  poetry out of it.  One of the ships was the _Riunione dei due Fratelli_.  I inquired whether the brothers had quarrelled and made it up.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"that is the worst of family quarrels; they do not last.\"    \"What do you mean, Peppino?  Surely it is better for brothers to be  friends than to quarrel?\"    \"If to be friends inside also, then is it a good thing and much better;  but look here, excuse me; the brothers are quarrelling and fighting and  are failing to kill each others and the parents are telling to don't be  quarrelling and the brothers are telling that they would be quarrelling  and the parents are telling to don't be stupid and to embrace and became  friends and the brothers are telling, Go away, parents, and to leave  alone to be quarrelling in peace.  But it is too difficult and many  months are passing and the brothers are--please, what is stanchi?  Excuse  me, it is fatigued, and are embracing to make pleasure to the parents and  to make riunione outside and to baptize the ship, but inside it is  riunione not at all.  It is to kiss with the lips and the heart is hating  each others.  This is not a good thing.\"    The boat with the name that pleased me best was not there.  Peppino told  me about it: it belonged to him before the money came from America and he  used it to ferry tourists across the bay and into the bowels of the  promontory through the mouth of a grotto where the reflected lights are  lovely on a sunny day; he called it the _Anime del Purgatorio_.    This would have been just the morning to visit the caves, for there were  no clouds.  We stood on the deck of the _Sorella di Ninu_, looking up  through the brown masts and the rigging into the blue sky, and watching  the gulls as they glided and circled above us and turned their white  wings to the sun.  Vanni did the honours of his ship, showed us his  barrels and casks, nearly all empty now, and made us look down into the  hold where there was a cask capable of holding, I forget how much, but it  was so big that it could never have been got into the ship after it was  made, so it had to be built inside.  Then we must taste his wine, of  which he still had some in one of the casks, and the captain brought  tumblers and another queer-shaped glass with a string round its rim in  which to fetch the wine up; it was about the size and shape of a  fir-cone, the broad upper part being hollow to hold the wine, and the  pointed lower part solid.  The captain held it by the string and dropped  it neatly down through the bung-hole, as one drops a bucket into a well;  its heavy point sank through the wine without any of that swishing and  swashing which happens with a flat-bottomed, buoyant, wooden bucket, and  he drew it up full and gleaming like a jewel.  The first lot was used to  rinse the tumblers inside and out and then thrown overboard, sparkling  and flashing in the sunlight as it fell into the sea.  The taster was  lowered again and the tumblers filled.    Vanni, seeing I admired the taster, wanted to give it to me, but it was  the only one he had and was in constant use when customers came to the  ship, so I declined it and he promised to bring one for me next time his  ship made a voyage; in the meantime I took one of the tumblers as a  ricordo.  Then we went into the captain's cabin and sat round his table  listening to his stories and smoking cigarettes.  Every now and then a  silence came over us, broken occasionally by one of us saying suddenly--    \"Ebbene, siamo qua!\"  (\"Well, here we are!\")    This sort of thing formerly used to make me feel nervous; it was as  though I had failed to entertain my friends or as though they had given  up the hope of entertaining me.  After experiencing it several times,  however, I came to take a different and more accurate view.  There was no  occasion to do or say anything.  We were enjoying one another's society.    Vanni told us he was thinking of taking a cargo of Marsala to England and  what would the English people say to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24654"],[0,"Chaldea: From the Earliest Times to the Rise of Assyria (#7)"],[1,"from the surrounding encampments; they could  scarcely be persuaded that the image was of stone, and contended that it  was not the work of men's hands, but of infidel giants of olden times.  The commotion soon spread to Mosul, where the terrified workman,  \"entering breathless into the bazars, announced to every one he met  that Nimrod had appeared.\" The authorities of the town were alarmed, put  their heads together and decided that such idolatrous proceedings were  an outrage to religion. The consequence was that Layard was requested by  his friend Ismail-Pasha to suspend operations for awhile, until the  excitement should have subsided, a request with which he thought it  wisest to comply without remonstrance, lest the people of Mosul might  come out in force and deal with his precious find as they had done with  the sculptured figure at Koyunjik in Rich's time. The alarm, however,  did not last long. Both Arabs and Turks soon became familiar with the  strange creations which kept emerging out of the earth, and learned to  discuss them with great calm and gravity. The colossal bulls and lions  with wings and human heads, of which several pairs were discovered, some  of them in a state of perfect preservation, were especially the objects  of wonder and conjectures, which generally ended in a curse \"on all  infidels and their works,\" the conclusion arrived at being that \"the  idols\" were to be sent to England, to form gateways to the palace of the  Queen. And when some of these giants, now in the British Museum, were  actually removed, with infinite pains and labor, to be dragged down to  the Tigris, and floated down the river on rafts, there was no end to the  astonishment of Layard's simple friends. On one such occasion an Arab  Sheikh, or chieftain, whose tribe had engaged to assist in moving one of  the winged bulls, opened his heart to him. \"In the name of the Most  High,\" said he, \"tell me, O Bey, what you are going to do with these  stones. So many thousands of purses spent on such things! Can it be, as  you say, that your people learn wisdom from them? or is it as his  reverence the Cadi declares, that they are to go to the palace of your  Queen, who, with the rest of the unbelievers, worships these idols? As  for wisdom, these figures will not teach you to make any better knives,  or scissors, or chintzes, and it is in the making of these things that  the English show their wisdom.\"    6. Such was the view very generally taken of Layard's work by both Turks  and Arabs, from the Pasha down to the humblest digger in his band of  laborers, and he seldom felt called upon to play the missionary of  science, knowing as he did that all such efforts would be but wasted  breath. This want of intellectual sympathy did not prevent the best  understanding from existing between himself and these rangers of the  desert. The primitive life which he led amongst them for so many months,  the kindly hospitality which he invariably experienced at their hands  during the excursions made and the visits he paid to different Bedouin  tribes in the intervals of recreation which he was compelled to allow  himself from time to time--these are among the most pleasurable memories  of those wonderful, dreamlike years. He lingers on them lovingly and  retraces them through many a page of both his books[C]--pages which, for  their picturesque vividness, must be perused with delight even by such  as are but slightly interested in the discovery of buried palaces and  winged bulls. One longs to have been with him through some of those  peerless evenings when, after a long day's work, he sat before his cabin  in the cool starlight, watching the dances with which those  indefatigable Arabs, men and women, solaced themselves deep into the  night, while the encampment was lively with the hum of voices, and the  fires lit to prepare the simple meal. One longs to have shared in some  of those brisk rides across plains so thickly enamelled with flowers,  that it seemed a patchwork of many colors, and \"the dogs, as they  returned from hunting, issued from the long grass dyed red, yellow, or  blue, according to the flowers through which they had last forced their  way,\"--the joy of the Arab's soul, which made the chief, Layard's  friend, continually exclaim, \"rioting in the luxuriant herbage and  scented air, as his mare waded through the flowers:--'What delight has  God given us equal to this? It is the only thing worth living for. What  do the dwellers in cities know of true happiness? They never have seen  grass or flowers! May God have pity on them!'\" How glorious to watch the  face of the desert changing its colors almost from day to day, white  succeeding to pale straw color, red to white, blue to red, lilac to  blue, and bright gold to that, according to the flowers with which it  decked itself! Out of sight stretches the gorgeous carpet, dotted with  the black camel's-hair tents of the Arabs, enlivened with flocks of  sheep and camels, and whole studs of horses of noble breed which are  brought out from Mosul and left to graze at liberty, in the days of  healthy breezes and fragrant pastures.    7. So much for spring. A beautiful, a perfect season, but unfortunately  as brief as it is lovely, and too soon succeeded by the terrible heat  and long drought of summer, which sometimes set in so suddenly as hardly  to give the few villagers time to gather in their crops. Chaldea or  Lower Mesopotamia is in this respect even worse off than the higher  plains of Assyria. A temperature of 120 deg. in the shade is no unusual  occurrence in Baghdad; true, it can be reduced to 100 deg. in the cellars  of the houses by carefully excluding the faintest ray of light, and it is  there that the inhabitants mostly spend their days in summer. The  oppression is such that Europeans are entirely unmanned and unfitted for  any kind of activity. \"Camels sicken, and birds are so distressed by the  high temperature, that they sit in the date-trees about Baghdad, with  their mouths open, panting for fresh air.\"[D]    8. But the most frightful feature of a Mesopotamian summer is the  frequent and violent sand-storms, during which travellers, in addition  to all the dangers offered by snow-storms--being buried alive and losing  their way--are exposed to that of suffocation not only from the  furnace-like heat of the desert-wind, but from the impalpable sand,  which is whirled and driven before it, and fills the eyes, mouth and  nostrils of horse and rider. The three miles' ride from Layard's  encampment to the mound of Nimrud must have been something more than  pleasant morning exercise in such a season, and though the deep trenches  and wells afforded a comparatively cool and delightful retreat, he soon  found that fever was the price to be paid for the indulgence, and was  repeatedly laid up with it. \"The verdure of the plain,\" he says in one  place, \"had perished almost in a day. Hot winds, coming from the desert,  had burnt up and carried away the shrubs; flights of locusts, darkening  the air, had destroyed the few patches of cultivation, and had completed  the havoc commenced by the heat of the sun.... Violent whirlwinds  occasionally swept over the face of the country. They could be seen as  they advanced from the desert, carrying along with them clouds of dust  and sand. Almost utter darkness prevailed during their passage, which  lasted generally about an hour, and nothing could resist their fury. On  returning home one afternoon after a tempest of the kind, I found no  traces of my dwellings; they had been completely carried away. Ponderous  wooden frame-works had been borne over the bank and hurled some hundred  yards distant; the tents had disappeared, and my furniture was scattered  over the plain.\"    9. Fortunately it would not require much labor to restore the wooden  frames to their proper place and reconstruct the reed-plaited,  mud-plastered walls as well as the roof composed of reeds and  boughs--such being the sumptuous residences of which Layard shared the  largest with various domestic animals, from whose immediate  companionship he was saved by a thin partition, the other hovels being  devoted to the wives, children and poultry of his host, to his own  servants and different household uses. But the time came when not even  this accommodation, poor as it was, could be enjoyed with any degree of  comfort. When the summer heat set in in earnest, the huts became  uninhabitable from their closeness and the vermin with which they  swarmed, while a canvas tent, though far preferable in the way of  airiness and cleanliness, did not afford sufficient shelter.    10. \"In this dilemma,\" says Layard, \"I ordered a recess to be cut into  the bank of the river where it rose perpendicularly from the water's  edge. By screening the front with reeds and boughs of trees, and  covering the whole with similar materials, a small room was formed. I  was much troubled, however, with scorpions and other reptiles, which  issued from the earth forming the walls of my apartment; and later in  the summer by the gnats and sandflies which hovered on a calm night over  the river.\" It is difficult to decide between the respective merits of  this novel summer retreat and of the winter dwelling, ambitiously  constructed of mud bricks dried in the sun, and roofed with solid wooden  beams. This imposing residence, in which Layard spent the last months of  his first winter in Assyria, would have been sufficient protection  against wind and weather, after it had been duly coated with mud.  Unfortunately a heavy shower fell before it was quite completed, and so  saturated the bricks that they did not dry again before the following  spring. \"The consequence was,\" he pleasantly remarks, \"that the only  verdure on which my eyes were permitted to feast before my return to  Europe, was furnished by my own property--the walls in the interior of  the rooms being continually"]]]
