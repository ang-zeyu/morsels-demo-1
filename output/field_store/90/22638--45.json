Since many entirely innocent young  girls to-day suffer from disease, incurred either through hereditary  or accidental infection, a would-be husband may be said to be quite as  much entitled to protection as his bride-to-be. Prohibitive physical  defects are also discovered in this connection.                                       CHAPTER VIII                         SEX IN THE MARRIAGE RELATION                                   THE WIFE      Girls marry, in the final analysis, because love for the male is an  innate natural principle of the female nature. At its best this love  is pure and chaste. The good woman realizes that its first purpose is  not mere carnal pleasure. It is a special avowal of the wife's  relations to her husband, and its natural as well as moral end is the  establishment of the family on the basis of a healthy progeny.                                  BEFORE MARRIAGE    The wife-to-be, like her prospective husband, will be well advised to  ask for a medical health certificate. No man, no matter how good his  reputation may be, should marry (on his own account as well as that of  the girl) without thorough examination by a physician. The  consequences of venereal infection administered to unborn children by  their parents are too horrible to allow of any risk being taken.  Another bit of advice, which cannot be too highly commended, is that  the prospective husband and wife, before they marry, have a plain talk  with each other regarding individual sexual peculiarities and needs. A  heart-to-heart talk of this kind would be apt to prevent great  disappointments and incompatibilities which otherwise may become  permanent.                             THE WIFE AND HER POSITION    The natural instinct of a man is to seek his mate. On her he depends  for an orderly and lawful indulgence of his sex demands. The greatest  longevity and best health are to be found among happily married  fathers and mothers. No young woman should marry without a full  knowledge of her sex duties to her husband. And she should never  consummate the marriage vow grudgingly.                                CHILDBIRTH HYGIENE    Childbirth is the natural consequence of marriage. Its processes have  already been explained in Chapter II of this book. There are, however,  some hygienic facts in connection with it which should be noted. Once  pregnancy is established, as soon as the fact is suspected, the  mother-to-be should look on the little embryo as already a member of  the family. Every act of each parent should now be performed (at least  to some degree) with reference to the forthcoming infant. The mother's  thoughts should be directed to it as much as possible. Mentally she  should read literature of a lofty and ennobling character. The theory  is that this serves a good purpose in producing a more perfect,  healthy and intelligent child. Physically, she should take plenty of  active exercise during gestation. Active exercise does not, of course,  mean violent exercise. And she should use a \"Health Lift.\" During  this time she should subsist as far as possible on a farinaceous  diet, fruits and vegetables. The foods should be plainly cooked,  without spices. If all else is as it should be, the birth of the child  at the end of the customary nine months will be attended by  comparatively little pain and danger.                      HOW OFTEN SHOULD CHILDBIRTH TAKE PLACE?    It is most important that the childbearing wife and mother have a long  period of rest between births. At least one year should separate a  birth and the conception following it. This means that about two years  should elapse between two births. If this rule be followed, the wife  will retain her health, and her children will also be healthy. It is  far better to give birth to seven children, who will live and be  healthy, than to bear fourteen, of whom seven are likely to die, while  the numerous successive births wear out and age the unfortunate  mother.                              MATRIMONIAL ADJUSTMENT    The above paragraph deals with one detail of what might be called  \"matrimonial adjustment.\" This adjustment or compromise is a feature  of all successful marriages. The individual cravings of husband and  wife must be reconciled by mutual good will and forbearance if they  are to be happy. Attention should be paid in particular to not  allowing habit, \"the worst foe of married happiness,\" to become too  well established in the home, and to cultivate that love and affection  which survives the decline of the sexual faculties.                                THE IDEAL MARRIAGE    The ideal marriage is the one in which affection combines to bring  happiness to both partners in a sane union of sex and soul. As one  commentator has rather unhappily expressed it: \"When married the  _battle_ for one united and harmonious life really begins!\" It is,  indeed, but too often a _battle_! Forbearance, consideration and  respect must be the foundation on which the ideal married state is  built. The husband should realize that his wife's love for him induces  her to allow privileges of a personal nature which her innate chastity  and timidity might otherwise refuse. In return, he should accept these  privileges with consideration. He should, in particular, on his  wedding night, take care not to shock his young bride's sensibilities.  He may easily give her a shock from which she will not recover for  years, and lead her to form an antipathy against the very act which is  \"the bond and seal of a truly happy married life.\"                                   BIRTH CONTROL    Material changes have taken place in the birth-rate of a number of  countries during the past fifteen or twenty years which cannot be  attributed to purely economic causes. They do not seem to depend on  such things as trade, employment and prices; but on the spread of an  idea or influence whose tendency must be deplored, that of \"birth  control,\" a phrase much heard in these days.    The fact that a decline in human fertility and a falling birth rate  are most noticeable in the relatively prosperous countries is a proof  that it does not proceed from economic causes; but is due rather to  the spread of the doctrine that it is permissible to restrict or  control birth. In such countries as the United States, England and  Australasia, where the standards of human comfort and living are  notoriously high, the decline in the birth rate has been most  noticeable. On the other hand, we find perhaps the greatest decline in  the birth rate in France, a country where the general well-being  probably reaches a lower depth in the community than in any other part  of Europe. A comparison of the birth rates of France and of Ireland,  for example, offer a valuable illustration of the point under  consideration. In France, more than half the women who have reached  the age of nubility are married; in Ireland, generally speaking, less  than a third. In both countries the crude birth rate is far below that  in other European lands. Yet the fertility of the Irish wife exceeded  that of her French compeer by 44 per cent in 1880, and by no less than  84 per cent in 1900. And since that time the prolificity of the Irish  mother has so increased that she is now, approximately speaking,  inferior only to the Dutch or Finnish mother in this respect.    In general, in any country where we find a diminished prolificity a  falling off of childbirth _unaccompanied_ by a decrease in the number  of marriages occurring at the reproductive ages, we may attribute this  decrease to _voluntary restriction of childbearing_ on the part of the  married, or in other words, to the prevalence of \"birth control.\"  This incidentally, is not a theoretical statement, but one supported  by the almost unanimous medical opinion in all countries. Everywhere  and especially here in our own United States, we find evidence of the  extensive employ of \"birth control\" measures to prevent that normal  development of family life which underlies the vigor and racial power  of every nation. These preventive measures which arbitrarily control  human birth had long been in use in France with results which,  especially since the war, have been frequently and publicly deplored  in the press, and have led the French Government to offer substantial  rewards to encourage the propagation of large families. From France  the preventive practices of \"birth control\" had spread, after 1870,  over nearly all the countries of western Europe, to England and to the  United States; though they are not as much apparent in those countries  where the Roman Church has a strong hold on the people.    As a general thing, the practice of thus unnaturally limiting  families--\"unnaturally\" since the custom of \"birth control\" derives  from no natural, physical law--prevails, in the first instance, among  the well-to-do, who should rather be the first to set the example of  protest against it by having the families they are so much better able  to support and educate than those less favored with the world's goods.  If the evil of voluntary control of human birth were restricted to a  privileged class, say one of wealth, the harm done would, perhaps, not  be so great. But, unfortunately, in the course of time it filters  down as a \"gospel of comfort\"--erroneous term!--to those whose  resources are less. They accept and practice this invidious system of  prevention and gradually the entire community is more or less  affected.    The whole system of \"birth control\" is opposed to natural, human and  religious law. Nature, in none of her manifestations, introduces  anything which may tend to prevent her great reason for being--the  propagation of the species. Birth as the natural sequence of mating is  her solemn and invariable law. It is in birth and rebirth that nature  renews herself and all the life of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23691"],[0,"Archeological Expedition to Arizona in 1895 (#7)"],[1,"to the  side of the cliff. On the lateral wall of this chamber, at about the  height of the head, a row of small holes had been drilled into the  solid wall. These holes (_d_, _d_, _d_) are almost too small for the  insertion of roof beams, and were probably made for pegs on which to  rest a beam for hanging blankets and other textile fabrics when not in  use. The roof of the cave was the natural rock, and showed over its  whole surface marks of a pecking implement.    The left chamber is 6 feet 6 inches broad, and from one corner,  opposite the doorway, a low passageway leads into a circular chamber,  6 feet in diameter, with its floor below the platform of the lateral  room. Between the chamber, on the left of the entrance, and the open  air, the wall of solid rock is broken by a slit-like crevice, which  allows the light to enter, and no doubt served as a window. A recess,  the floor of which is elevated, on a platform opposite the doorway, is  5 feet broad, and has a small circular depression in one corner. The  floor and upraise of this recess is plastered with adobe, which in  several places is smooth and well made.    In comparing the remaining cavate dwellings of this series with that  described, we find every degree of complication in the arrangement of  rooms, from a simple cave, or irregular hole in the side of the cliff,  to squared chambers with lateral rooms. The room _I_,[16] for  instance, is rectangular, 6 feet long by 3 feet wide, with an entrance  the same width as that of the room itself.    In room _III_, however, the external opening is very small, and there  is a low, narrow ledge, or platform, opposite the doorway. There is  likewise in this room a small shelf in the left-hand wall. In _IV_  there is a raised platform on two adjacent sides of the square room,  and the doorway is an irregular orifice broken through the wall to the  open air.    Room _IV_ is a subterranean chamber, most of the floor of which is  littered with large fragments of rock which have fallen from the roof.  It has numerous small recesses in the wall resembling cubby-holes  where household utensils of various kinds were undoubtedly formerly  kept. This room is instructive, in that the entrance is partially  closed by two walls of masonry, which do not join. The stones are  laid in adobe in which fragments of pottery were detected. These  unjoined walls leave a doorway which is thus flanked on each side by  stone masonry, recalling in every particular the well-known walls of  cliff houses. Here, in fact, we have so close a resemblance to the  masonry of true cliff houses that we can hardly doubt that the  excavators of the cavate dwellings were, in reality, people similar to  those who built the cliff houses of Verde valley.    Room _VIII_ is a simple cave hewn out of the rock, with a chamber  behind it, entered by a passageway made of masonry, which partially  fills a larger opening. The doorway through this masonry is small  below, but broadens above in much the same manner as some of the  doorways in Tusayan of today.    Continuing along the left bank of the river, from the row of cavate  rooms, just described, on the first mesa, we round a promontory and  enter a small canyon,[17] which is perforated on each side with  numerous other cavate dwellings, large and small, all of the same  general character as the type described. Here, likewise, are small  external openings which evidently communicated with subterranean  chambers, but many of them are so elevated that access to them from  the floor of the canyon or from the cliff above is not possible. A  marked feature of the whole series is the existence here and there of  small, often inaccessible, stone cists of masonry plastered to the  side of the rocky cliff like swallows' nests.    All of these cists which are accessible had been opened and plundered  before my visit, but there yet remain a few which are still intact and  would repay examination and study. Similar walled-up cists are  likewise found, as we shall see later, in the cliff-houses of the  Red-rock country, hence are not confined to the Verde system of ruins.    Cavate dwellings similar to those here described are reported to exist  in the canyons of upper Salado, Gala, and Zuni rivers, and we may with  reason suspect that the distribution[18] of cavate dwellings is as  wide as that of the pueblos themselves, the sole requisite being a  soft tufaceous rock, capable of being easily worked by people with  stone implements. In none of the different regions in which they exist  is there any probability that these caves were made by people  different in culture from pueblo or cliff dwellers. They are much more  likely to have been permanent than temporary habitations of the same  culture stock of Indians who availed themselves of rock shelters  wherever the nature of the cliff permitted excavation in its walls.    That the cavate lodges are simple \"horticultural outlooks\" is an  important suggestion, but one might question whether they were  conveniently placed for that purpose. So far as overlooking the  opposite plain (which had undoubtedly been cultivated in ancient  times) is concerned, the position of some of them may be regarded good  for that purpose, but certainly not so commanding as that of the hill  or mesa above, where well-marked ruins still exist.    The position of the cavate dwellings is a disadvantageous one to reach  any cultivated fields if defenders were necessary. When the Tusayan  Indian today moves to his _kisi_ or summer brush house shelter he  practically camps in his corn or near it, in easy reach to drive away  crows, or build wind-breaks to shelter the tender sprouts; but to go  to their cornfields the inhabitants of the cavate dwellings I have  described were forced to cross a river before the farm was reached.  That these cavate dwellings were lookouts none can deny, but I incline  to a belief that this does not tell the whole story if we limit them  to such use. It is not wholly clear to me that they were not likewise  an asylum for refuge, possibly not inhabited continuously, but a very  welcome retreat when the agriculturist was sorely pressed by enemies.  Following the analogy of a Hopi custom of building temporary booths  near their fields, may we not suppose that the former inhabitants of  Verde valley may have erected similar shelters in their cornfields  during summer months, retiring to the cavate dwellings and the mesa  tops in winter? All available evidence would indicate that the cavate  dwellings were permanent habitations.[19]    There are several square ruins on top of the mesa above the cavate  dwellings. The walls of these were massive, but they are now very much  broken down, and the adobe plastering is so eroded from the masonry  that I regard them of considerable antiquity. They do not differ from  other similar ruins, so common elsewhere in New Mexico and Arizona,  and are identical with others in the Verde region. I visited several  of these ruins, but made no excavations in them, nor added any new  data to our knowledge of this type of aboriginal buildings. The  pottery picked up on the surface resembles that of the ruins of the  Little Colorado and Gila.    The dwellings which I have mentioned above are said[20] to be  duplicated at many other points in the watershed of the Verde, and  many undescribed ruins of this nature were reported to me by ranchmen.  I do not regard them as older than the adjacent ruins on the mesa  above or the plains below them, much less as productions of people of  different stages of culture, for everything about them suggests  contemporaneous occupancy.    From what little I saw of the village sites on the Verde I believe  that Mindeleff is correct in considering that these ruins represent  a comparatively late period of pueblo architecture. The character  of the cliff houses of the Red-rocks shows no very great antiquity of  occupancy. While it is not possible to give any approximate date when  they were inhabited, their general appearance indicates that they are  not more than two centuries old. There is, however, no reference to  them in the early Spanish history of the Southwest.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XCIII    BOWLDER WITH PICTOGRAPHS NEAR WOOD'S RANCH]    Few pictographs were found in the immediate neighborhood of the cavate  dwellings; indeed the rock in their vicinity is too soft to preserve  for any considerable time any great number of these rock etchings.  Examples of ancient paleography were, however, discovered a short  distance higher up the river on malpais rock, which is harder and less  rapidly eroded. A half-buried bowlder (plate XCIII) near Wood's ranch  was found to be covered with the well-known spirals with zigzag  attachments, horned animals resembling antelopes, growing corn, rain  clouds, and similar figures. These pictographs occur on a black,  superficial layer of lava rock, or upon lighter stone with a malpais  layer, which had been pecked through, showing a lighter color beneath.  There is little doubt that many examples of aboriginal pictography  exist in this neighborhood, which would reward exploration with  interesting data. The Verde pictographs can not be distinguished, so  far as designs are concerned, from many found elsewhere in Colorado,  Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona.    An instructive pictograph, different from any which I have elsewhere  seen, was discovered on the upturned side of a bowlder not far from  Hance's ranch, near the road from Camp Verde to the cavate dwellings.  The bowlder upon which they occur lies on top of a low hill, to the  left of the road, near the river. It consists of a rectangular network  of lines, with attached key extensions, crooks, and triangles, all  pecked in the surface. This daedalus of lines arises from grooves,  which originate in two small, rounded depressions in the rock, near"]]]
