The warlike spirit among the women, consistent with ages of barbarism,  when every thing is impetuous because nothing is fixed, and when all  excess is the excess of force, continued in Europe upwards of four  hundred years, showing itself from time to time, and always in the  middle of convulsions, or on the eve of great revolutions.    But there were eras and countries, in which that spirit appeared with  particular lustre. Such were the displays it made in the fifteenth and  sixteenth centuries in Hungary, and in the Islands of the Archipelago  and the Mediterranean, when they were invaded by the Turks.    Every thing conspired to animate the women of those countries with an  exalted courage; the prevailing spirit of the foregoing ages; the terror  which the name of the Turks inspired; the still more dreadful  apprehensions of an unknown enemy; the difference of _dress_, which has  a stronger _effect_ than is commonly supposed on the imagination of a  people; the difference of religion, which produced a kind of sacred  horror; the striking difference of manners; and above all, the  confinement of the female sex, which presented to the women of Europe  nothing but the frightful ideas of servitude and a master; the groans of  honor, the tears of beauty in the embrace of barbarism, and the double  tyranny of love and pride!    The contemplation of these objects, accordingly, roused in the hearts of  the women a resolute courage to defend themselves; nay, sometimes even a  courage of enthusiasm, which hurled itself against the enemy.--That  courage, too, was augmented, by the promises of a religion, which  offered eternal happiness in exchange for the sufferings of a moment.    It is not therefore surprising, that when three beautiful women of the  isle of Cyprus were led prisoners to Selim, to be secluded in the  seraglio, one of them, preferring death to such a condition, conceived  the project of setting fire to the magazine; and after having  communicated her design to the rest, put it in execution.    The year following, a city of Cyprus being besieged by the Turks, the  women ran in crowds, mingling themselves with the soldiers, and,  fighting gallantly in the breach, were the means of saving their  country.    Under Mahomet II. a girl of the isle of Lemnos, armed with the sword and  shield of her father, who had fallen in battle, opposed the Turks, when  they had forced a gate, and chased them to the shore.    In the two celebrated sieges of Rhodes and Malta, the women, seconding  the zeal of the knights, discovered upon all occasions the greatest  intrepidity; not only that impetuous and temporary impulse which  despises death, but that cool and deliberate fortitude which can support  the continued hardships, the toils, and the miseries of war.      OTHER PARTICULARS RESPECTING FEMALES DURING THE AGE OF CHIVALRY.    When a man had said any thing that reflected dishonor on a woman, or  accused her of a crime, she was not obliged to fight him to prove her  innocence: the combat would have been unequal. But she might choose a  champion to fight in her cause, or expose himself to the horrid trial,  in order to clear her reputation. Such champions were generally selected  from her lovers or friends. But if she fixed upon any other, so high was  the spirit of martial glory, and so eager the thirst of defending the  weak and helpless sex, that we meet with no instance of a champion ever  having refused to fight for, or undergo whatever custom required, in  defence of the lady who had honored him with the appointment.    To the motives already mentioned, we may add another. He who had  refused, must inevitably have been branded with the name of coward: and,  so despicable was the condition of a coward, in those times of general  heroism, that death itself appeared the more preferable choice. Nay,  such was the rage of fighting for women, that it became customary for  those who could not be honored with the decision of their real quarrels,  to create fictitious ones concerning them, in order to create also a  necessity of fighting.    Nor was fighting for the ladies confined to single combatants. Crowds of  gallants entered the lists against each other. Even kings called out  their subjects, to shew their love for their mistresses, by cutting the  throats of their neighbors, who had not in the least offended.    In the fourteenth century, when the Countess of Blois and the widow of  Mountford were at war against each other, a conference was agreed to, on  pretence of settling a peace, but in reality to appoint a combat.  Instead of negotiating, they soon challenged each other; and Beaumanoir,  who was at the head of the Britons, publicly declared that they fought  for no other motive, than to see, by the victory, who had the fairest  mistress.    In the fifteenth century, we find an anecdote of this kind still more  extraordinary. John, duke de Bourbonnois, published a declaration, that  he would go over to England, with sixteen knights, and there fight it  out, in order to avoid idleness, and merit the good graces of his  mistress.    James IV. of Scotland, having, in all tournaments, professed himself  knight to queen Anne of France, she summoned him to prove himself her  true and valorous champion, by taking the field in her defence, against  his brother-in-law, Henry VIII. of England. He obeyed the romantic  mandate; and the two nations bled to feed the vanity of a woman.    Warriors, when ready to engage, invoked the aid of their mistresses, as  poets do that of the Muses. If they fought valiantly, it reflected honor  on the Dulcineas they adored; but if they turned their backs on their  enemies, the poor ladies were dishonored forever.    Love, was at that time, the most prevailing motive to fighting. The  famous Gaston de Foix, who commanded the French troops at the battle of  Ravenna, took advantage of this foible of his army. He rode from rank to  rank, calling his officers by name, and even some of his private men,  recommending to them their country, their honor, and, above all, to shew  what they could do for their mistresses.    The women of those ages, the reader may imagine, were certainly more  completely happy than in any other period of the world. This, however,  was not in reality the case.    Custom, which governs all things with the most absolute sway, had,  through a long succession of years, given her sanction to such combats  as were undertaken, either to defend the innocence, or display the  beauty of women. Custom, therefore, either obliged a man to fight for a  woman who desired him, or marked the refusal with infamy and disgrace.  But custom did not oblige him, in every other part of his conduct, to  behave to this woman, or to the sex in general, with that respect and  politeness which have happily distinguished the character of more modern  times.    The same man who would have encountered giants, or gigantic  difficulties, \"when a lady was in the case,\" had but little idea of  adding to her happiness, by supplying her with the comforts and  elegancies of life. And, had she asked him to stoop, and ease her of a  part of that domestic slavery which, almost in every country, falls to  the lot of women, he would have thought himself quite affronted.    But besides, men had nothing else, in those ages, than that kind of  romantic gallantry to recommend them. Ignorant of letters, arts, and  sciences, and every thing that refines human nature, they were, in every  thing where gallantry was not concerned, rough and unpolished in their  manners and behavior. Their time was spent in drinking, war, gallantry,  and idleness. In their hours of relaxation, they were but little in  company with their women; and when they were, the indelicacies of the  carousal, or the cruelties of the field, were almost the only subjects  they had to talk of.    From the subversion of the Roman empire, to the fourteenth or fifteenth  century, women spent most of their time alone. They were almost entire  strangers to the joys of social life. They seldom went abroad, but to be  spectators of such public diversions and amusements as the fashion of  the times countenanced. Francis I. was the first monarch who introduced  them on public days to court.    Before his time, nothing was to be seen at any of the courts of Europe,  but long bearded politicians, plotting the destruction of the rights and  liberties of mankind; and warriors clad in complete armor, ready to put  their plots in execution.    In the eighth century, so slavish was the condition of women on the one  hand, and so much was beauty coveted on the other, that, for about two  hundred years, the kings of Austria were obliged to pay a tribute to the  Moors, of one hundred beautiful virgins per annum.    In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, elegance had scarcely any  existence, and even cleanliness was hardly considered as laudable. The  use of linen was not known; and the most delicate of the fair sex wore  woollen shifts.    In the time of Henry VIII. the peers of the realm carried their wives  behind them on horseback when they went to London; and, in the same  manner, took them back to their country seats, with hoods of waxed linen  over their heads, and wrapped in mantles of cloth, to secure them from  the cold.    There was one misfortune of a singular nature, to which women were  liable in those days: they were in perpetual danger of being accused of  witchcraft, and suffering all the cruelties and indignities of a mob,  instigated by superstition and directed by enthusiasm; or of being  condemned by laws, which were at once a disgrace to humanity and to  sense. Even the bloom of youth and beauty could not secure them from  torture and from death. But when age and wrinkles attacked a woman, if  any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2612"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 3 (#7)"],[1," had reason to hate him, affirmed that he had obtained  his place by bullying the Lords of the Treasury, and particularly by  threatening that, if his just claims were disregarded, he would be the  death of Hampden. [31]    Some weeks elapsed before all the arrangements which have been mentioned  were publicly announced: and meanwhile many important events had taken  place. As soon as the new Privy Councillors had been sworn in, it was  necessary to submit to them a grave and pressing question. Could the  Convention now assembled be turned into a Parliament? The Whigs, who had  a decided majority in the Lower House, were all for the affirmative.  The Tories, who knew that, within the last month, the public feeling had  undergone a considerable change, and who hoped that a general election  would add to their strength, were for the negative. They maintained  that to the existence of a Parliament royal writs were indispensably  necessary. The Convention had not been summoned by such writs: the  original defect could not now be supplied: the Houses were therefore  mere clubs of private men, and ought instantly to disperse.    It was answered that the royal writ was mere matter of form, and that to  expose the substance of our laws and liberties to serious hazard for the  sake of a form would be the most senseless superstition. Wherever the  Sovereign, the Peers spiritual and temporal, and the Representatives  freely chosen by the constituent bodies of the realm were met together,  there was the essence of a Parliament. Such a Parliament was now  in being; and what could be more absurd than to dissolve it at a  conjuncture when every hour was precious, when numerous important  subjects required immediate legislation, and when dangers, only to be  averted by the combined efforts of King, Lords, and Commons, menaced  the State? A Jacobite indeed might consistently refuse to recognise the  Convention as a Parliament. For he held that it had from the beginning  been an unlawful assembly, that all its resolutions were nullities,  and that the Sovereigns whom it had set up were usurpers. But with what  consistency could any man, who maintained that a new Parliament ought to  be immediately called by writs under the great seal of William and Mary,  question the authority which had placed William and Mary on the throne?  Those who held that William was rightful King must necessarily hold that  the body from which he derived his right was itself a rightful Great  Council of the Realm. Those who, though not holding him to be rightful  King, conceived that they might lawfully swear allegiance to him as King  in fact, might surely, on the same principle, acknowledge the Convention  as a Parliament in fact. It was plain that the Convention was the  fountainhead from which the authority of all future Parliaments must be  derived, and that on the validity of the votes of the Convention must  depend the validity of every future statute. And how could the  stream rise higher than the source? Was it not absurd to say that the  Convention was supreme in the state, and yet a nullity; a legislature  for the highest of all purposes, and yet no legislature for the  humblest purposes; competent to declare the throne vacant, to change  the succession, to fix the landmarks of the constitution, and yet not  competent to pass the most trivial Act for the repairing of a pier or  the building of a parish church?    These arguments would have had considerable weight, even if every  precedent had been on the other side. But in truth our history afforded  only one precedent which was at all in point; and that precedent  was decisive in favour of the doctrine that royal writs are not  indispensably necessary to the existence of a Parliament. No royal writ  had summoned the Convention which recalled Charles the Second. Yet  that Convention had, after his Restoration, continued to sit and to  legislate, had settled the revenue, had passed an Act of amnesty, had  abolished the feudal tenures. These proceedings had been sanctioned by  authority of which no party in the state could speak without reverence.  Hale had borne a considerable share in them, and had always maintained  that they were strictly legal. Clarendon, little as he was inclined to  favour any doctrine derogatory to the rights of the Crown, or to the  dignity of that seal of which he was keeper, had declared that, since  God had, at a most critical conjuncture, given the nation a good  Parliament, it would be the height of folly to look for technical flaws  in the instrument by which that Parliament was called together. Would  it be pretended by any Tory that the Convention of 1660 had a more  respectable origin than the Convention of 1689? Was not a letter written  by the first Prince of the Blood, at the request of the whole peerage,  and of hundreds of gentlemen who had represented counties and towns, at  least as good a warrant as a vote of the Rump?    Weaker reasons than these would have satisfied the Whigs who formed  the majority of the Privy Council. The King therefore, on the fifth  day after he had been proclaimed, went with royal state to the House of  Lords, and took his seat on the throne. The Commons were called in; and  he, with many gracious expressions, reminded his hearers of the perilous  situation of the country, and exhorted them to take such steps as might  prevent unnecessary delay in the transaction of public business. His  speech was received by the gentlemen who crowded the bar with the deep  hum by which our ancestors were wont to indicate approbation, and which  was often heard in places more sacred than the Chamber of the Peers.  [32] As soon as he had retired, a Bill declaring the Convention a  Parliament was laid on the table of the Lords, and rapidly passed by  them. In the Commons the debates were warm. The House resolved itself  into a Committee; and so great was the excitement that, when the  authority of the Speaker was withdrawn, it was hardly possible to  preserve order. Sharp personalities were exchanged. The phrase, \"hear  him,\" a phrase which had originally been used only to silence  irregular noises, and to remind members of the duty of attending to the  discussion, had, during some years, been gradually becoming what it  now is; that is to say, a cry indicative, according to the tone, of  admiration, acquiescence, indignation, or derision. On this occasion,  the Whigs vociferated \"Hear, hear,\" so tumultuously that the Tories  complained of unfair usage. Seymour, the leader of the minority,  declared that there could be no freedom of debate while such clamour was  tolerated. Some old Whig members were provoked into reminding him that  the same clamour had occasionally been heard when he presided, and had  not then been repressed. Yet, eager and angry as both sides were, the  speeches on both sides indicated that profound reverence for law and  prescription which has long been characteristic of Englishmen, and  which, though it runs sometimes into pedantry and sometimes into  superstition, is not without its advantages. Even at that momentous  crisis, when the nation was still in the ferment of a revolution, our  public men talked long and seriously about all the circumstances of the  deposition of Edward the Second and of the deposition of Richard  the Second, and anxiously inquired whether the assembly which, with  Archbishop Lanfranc at its head, set aside Robert of Normandy, and put  William Rufus on the throne, did or did not afterwards continue to act  as the legislature of the realm. Much was said about the history  of writs; much about the etymology of the word Parliament. It is  remarkable, that the orator who took the most statesmanlike view of the  subject was old Maynard. In the civil conflicts of fifty eventful years  he had learned that questions affecting the highest interests of the  commonwealth were not to be decided by verbal cavils and by scraps of  Law French and Law Latin; and, being by universal acknowledgment the  most subtle and the most learned of English jurists, he could express  what he felt without the risk of being accused of ignorance and  presumption. He scornfully thrust aside as frivolous and out of place  all that blackletter learning, which some men, far less versed in such  matters than himself, had introduced into the discussion. \"We are,\"  he said, \"at this moment out of the beaten path. If therefore we are  determined to move only in that path, we cannot move at all. A man in  a revolution resolving to do nothing which is not strictly according to  established form resembles a man who has lost himself in the wilderness,  and who stands crying 'Where is the king's highway? I will walk nowhere  but on the king's highway.' In a wilderness a man should take the track  which will carry him home. In a revolution we must have recourse to  the highest law, the safety of the state.\" Another veteran Roundhead,  Colonel Birch, took the same side, and argued with great force and  keenness from the precedent of 1660. Seymour and his supporters were  beaten in the Committee, and did not venture to divide the House on the  Report. The Bill passed rapidly, and received the royal assent on the  tenth day after the accession of William and Mary. [33]    The law which turned the Convention into a Parliament contained a clause  providing that no person should, after the first of March, sit or vote  in either House without taking the oaths to the new King and Queen. This  enactment produced great agitation throughout society. The adherents of  the exiled dynasty hoped and confidently predicted that the recusants  would be numerous. The minority in both Houses, it was said, would be  true to the cause of hereditary monarchy. There might be here and there  a traitor; but the great body of those who had voted for a Regency would  be firm. Only two Bishops at most would recognise the usurpers. Seymour  would retire from public"]]]
