I have            a favorite recipe, however, something of which I            am very fond and which I might give to you. I got            it out of the newspapers and it is as follows:              Spread one or two rashers of lean bacon on a            baking tin, cover it thickly with slices of            cheese, and sprinkle a little mustard and paprika            over it. Bake it in a slow oven for half an hour            and serve with slices of dry toast.              Now that is a particularly tasty dish if it is            well done. I never did it, but somebody must be            able to do it who could do it well.                                 Faithfully yours,                                          ANNA H. SHAW.    [Illustration]      Daube    Brown a thick slice from a round of beef in a hot pan and season  carefully, adding water to make a pan gravy; add also a pint of tomato  juice and onion juice to taste; cover and simmer gently for at least an  hour and a half; turn the meat frequently, keeping the gravy in  sufficient quantity to insure that the meat shall be thoroughly moist  and thoroughly seasoned.    When served, it should be, if carefully done, very tender. The gravy may  be thickened or not, according to individual taste.                                                         MRS. SAM'L SEMPLE.    [Illustration]      Liver a la Creole    Take a fine calf liver. Skin well and cut in thick slices. Season with  salt and pepper. Fry in deep fat and drain.    Chop fine two tablespoons parsley. Melt two tablespoons butter, toss in  parsley and pour at once over liver and serve.      Chicken Croquettes              1 pound of chicken            3 teaspoons chopped parsley            1 1/2 cups cream            1 small onion            1/4 pound butter            1/4 pound bread crumbs            season to taste            1 pinch of paprika    Grind meat twice. Boil the onion with the cream and strain the onion  out. Let cool and pour over crumbs. Add parsley and butter, and make a  stiff mixture. Now add seasoning.    Mix all together by beating in the meat. If too thick add a little milk  and form into croquettes, and put in ice box.    When cool dip in beaten egg and then in crackers or bread crumbs. Fry in  deep fat.      Nuts as A Substitute for Meat    Although many are trying to eliminate so much meat from menus on account  of its soaring cost, the person who performs hard labor must have in its  place something which contains the chief constituents of meat, protein  and fats, or the body will not respond to the demands made upon it  because of lowered vitality from lack of food elements needed.  Scientific analyses have proven that nuts contain more food value to the  pound than almost any other food product known. Ten cent's worth of  peanuts, for example, at 7 cents a pound will furnish more than twice  the protein and six times more energy than could be obtained by the same  outlay for a porterhouse steak at 25 cents a pound.    One reason for the tardy appreciation of the nutritive value of nuts is  their reputation of indigestibility. The discomfort from eating them is  often due to insufficient mastication and to the fact that they are  usually eaten when not needed, as after a hearty meal or late at night,  whereas, being so concentrated, they should constitute an integral part  of the menu, rather than supplement an already abundant meal, says the  Philadelphia Ledger. They should be used in connection with more bulky  carbohydrate foods, such as vegetables, fruits, bread, crackers, etc.;  too concentrated nutriment is often the cause of digestive disturbance,  for a certain bulkiness is essential to normal assimilation.      Pecan Nut Loaf              1 cup hot boiled rice            1 cup pecan nut meat (finely chopped)            1 cup cracker crumbs            1 egg            1 cup milk            1 1/4 teaspoons salt            pepper to taste            1 teaspoon melted butter    Mix rice, nut meats, cracker crumbs; then add egg well beaten, the milk,  salt and pepper.    Turn into buttered bread pan; pour over butter, cover and bake in a  moderate oven 1 hour.    Put on hot platter and pour around same this sauce:    Cook 3 tablespoons butter with slice of onion and a few pimentos,  stirring constantly. Add 3 tablespoons flour; stir, pour in gradually  1 1/2 cups milk.    Season and strain.                \"I am in earnest. I will not equivocate--I will            not excuse--I will not retreat a single inch--AND            I WILL BE HEARD.\"                                             WM. LLOYD GARRISON.    [Illustration]      Nut Hash    Nut hash is a good breakfast dish. Chop fine cold boiled potatoes and  any other vegetable which is on hand and put into buttered frying pan,  heat quickly and thoroughly, salt to taste, and just before removing  from the fire stir in lightly a large spoonful of peanut meal for each  person to be served. To prepare the meal at home, procure raw nuts,  shell them and put in the oven just long enough to loosen the brown  skin; rub these off and put the nuts through the grinder adjusted to  make meal rather than an oily mixture. This put in glass jars, and kept  in a cool place will be good for weeks. It may too, be used for  thickening soups or sauces, or may be added in small quantities to  breakfast muffins and griddle-cakes.    Potato soup, cream of pea, corn or asparagus and bean soup may be made  after the ordinary recipes, omitting the butter and flour and adding  four tablespoons of peanut meal.      Nut Turkey    Nut turkey for Thanksgiving instead of the national bird, made by mixing  one quart of sifted dry bread crumbs with one pint of chopped English  walnuts--any other kind of nuts will go--and one cupful of peanuts,  simply washed and dried, and adding a level teaspoon of sage, two of  salt, a tablespoon of chopped parsley, two raw eggs, not beaten, and  sufficient water to bind the mass together. Then form into the shape of  a turkey, with pieces of macaroni to form the leg bones. Brush with a  little butter and bake an hour in a slow oven and serve with drawn  butter sauce.    A dinner roast made of nuts and cheese contains the elements of meat.  Cook two tablespoons of chopped onion in a tablespoon of butter and a  little water until it is tender, then mix with it one cupful each of  grated cheese, chopped English walnuts and bread crumbs, salt and pepper  to taste and the juice of half a lemon; moisten with water, using that  in which the onion has been cooked; put into a shallow baking dish and  brown in the oven.    Hickory nut loaf is another dish which can take the place of meat at  dinner. Mix two cups of rolled oats, a cupful each of celery and milk,  two cups of bread crumbs and two eggs, season and shape, then bake 20  minutes. Serve with a gravy made like other gravy, with the addition of  a teaspoon of rolled nuts.      Nut Scrapple    On a crisp winter morning a dish of nut scrapple is very appetizing and  just as nutritious as that made of pork. To make it, take two cupfuls of  cornmeal, one of hominy and a tablespoon of salt and cook in a double  boiler, with just enough boiling water until it is of the consistency of  frying. While still hot add two cupfuls of nut meats which had been put  through the chopper; pour into buttered pan and use like other scrapple.    Peanut omelet is a delicious way to serve nuts. Make a cream sauce with  one tablespoon of butter, two tablespoons of flour and three-quarters of  a cupful of flour and three-quarters of a cupful of milk poured in  slowly. Take from the fire, season, add three-quarters of a cupful of  ground peanuts and pour the mixture on the lightly beaten yolks of three  eggs. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites, pour into a hot baking dish and  bake for 20 minutes.      Nut Roast              3 eggs (beaten with egg beater)            2 cups English Walnut meats            milk to moisten it            4 cups of bread crumbs (grated)            1 small tablespoon butter            pinch salt.    1 1/2 cups of walnut meats will do. 1/4 lb. of the meats is 1 1/2 cups.  A 1/4 lb. of the meats equals 1/2 lb. in the shells and the labor of  shelling is saved.    Melt butter and pour over mixture, salt, then add enough milk to  moisten, so as to form the shape of a loaf of bread. Too little milk  will cause the loaf to separate, likewise, too much will make it mushy.  Chop walnuts exceedingly fine. Bake between 20 to 30 minutes in buttered  bread pan or baking dish. A small slice goes very far as it is solid and  rich. Serve with hot tomato sauce.    This makes a delicious luncheon dish, served with peas and a nice  salad.      Oatmeal Nut Loaf    Oatmeal nut loaf can be served cold in place of meat for Sunday night  tea. Put two cups of water in a sauce pan; when boiling add a cupful of  oatmeal, stirring until thick; then stir in a cupful of peanuts that  have been twice through the grinder, two tablespoons of salt, half a  teaspoon of butter, and pack into a tin bucket with a tight fitting lid  and steam for two hours; slice down when cold. This will keep several  days if left in the covered tin and kept in a cool place. A delicious  sandwich filling can be made from chopped raisins and nuts mixed with a  little orange or lemon juice. Cooked prunes may be used instead of  raisins.                Rastus: \"So you wife am one of dem Suffragettes?

The Tongan belief that, after death, the  human Atua more readily distinguishes good from evil, runs parallel with  the old Israelitic conception of Elohim expressed in Genesis, \"Ye shall  be as Elohim, knowing good from evil.\" They further agreed with the old  Israelites, that \"all rewards for virtue and punishments for vice happen  to men in this world only, and come immediately from the gods\" (vol. ii.  p. 100). Moreover, they were of opinion that though the gods approve of  some kinds of virtue, are displeased with some kinds of vice, and, to a  certain extent, protect or forsake their worshippers according to  their moral conduct, yet neglect to pay due respect to the deities, and  forgetfulness to keep them in good humour, might be visited with even  worse consequences than moral delinquency. And those who will carefully  study the so-called \"Mosaic code\" contained in the books of Exodus,  Leviticus, and Numbers, will see that, though Jahveh's prohibitions of  certain forms of immorality are strict and sweeping, his wrath is quite  as strongly kindled against infractions of ritual ordinances. Accidental  homicide may go unpunished, and reparation may be made for wilful theft.  On the other hand, Nadab and Abihu, who \"offered strange fire before  Jahveh, which he had not commanded them,\" were swiftly devoured by  Jahveh's fire; he who sacrificed anywhere except at the allotted place  was to be \"cut off from his people\"; so was he who ate blood; and the  details of the upholstery of the Tabernacle, of the millinery of the  priests' vestments, and of the cabinet work of the ark, can plead direct  authority from Jahveh, no less than moral commands.    Amongst the Tongans, the sacrifices were regarded as gifts of food and  drink offered to the divine Atuas, just as the articles deposited by the  graves of the recently dead were meant as food for Atuas of lower rank.  A kava root was a constant form of offering all over Polynesia. In the  excellent work of the Rev. George Turner, entitled _Nineteen Years in  Polynesia_ (p. 241), I find it said of the Samoans (near neighbours of  the Tongans):--       _The offerings_ were principally cooked food. As in ancient     Greece so in Samoa, the first cup was in honour of the god.     It was either poured out on the ground or _waved_ towards     the heavens, reminding us again of the Mosaic ceremonies.     The chiefs all drank a portion out of the same cup, according to     rank; and after that, the food brought as an offering was     divided and eaten '_there before the Lord._'    In Tonga, when they consulted a god who had a priest, the latter, as  representative of the god, had the first cup; but if the god, like  Ta-li-y-Tooboo, had no priest, then the chief place was left vacant, and  was supposed to be occupied by the god himself. When the first cup of  kava was filled, the mataboole who acted as master of the ceremonies  said, \"Give it to your god,\" and it was offered, though only as a matter  of form. In Tonga and Samoa there were many sacred places or _morais,_  with houses of the ordinary construction, but which served as temples in  consequence of being dedicated to various gods; and there were altars  on which the sacrifices were offered; nevertheless there were few or  no images. Mariner mentions none in Tonga, and the Samoans seem to have  been regarded as no better than atheists by other Polynesians because  they had none. It does not appear that either of these peoples had  images even of their family or ancestral gods.    In Tahiti and the adjacent islands, Moerenhout (t. i. p. 471) makes the  very interesting observation, not only that idols were often absent,  but that, where they existed, the images of the gods served merely as  depositories for the proper representatives of the divinity. Each of  these was called a _maro aurou,_ and was a kind of girdle artistically  adorned with red, yellow, blue, and black feathers--the red feathers  being especially important--which were consecrated and kept as sacred  objects within the idols. They were worn by great personages on solemn  occasions, and conferred upon their wearers a sacred and almost divine  character. There is no distinct evidence that the _maro aurou_ was  supposed to have any special efficacy in divination, but one cannot fail  to see a certain parallelism between this holy girdle, which endowed its  wearer with a particular sanctity, and the ephod.    According to the Rev. R. Taylor, the New Zealanders formerly used the  word _karakia_ (now employed for \"prayer\") to signify a \"spell, charm,  or incantation,\" and the utterance of these karakias constituted the  chief part of their cult. In the south, the officiating priest had a  small image, \"about eighteen inches long, resembling a peg with a  carved head,\" which reminds one of the form commonly attributed to the  teraphim.    \"The priest first bandaged a fillet of red parrot feathers under the  god's chin, which was called his pahau or beard; this bandage was made  of a certain kind of sennet, which was tied on in a peculiar way. When  this was done it was taken possession of by the Atua, whose spirit  entered it. The priest then either held it in the hand and vibrated it  in the air whilst the powerful karakia was repeated, or he tied a piece  of string (formed of the centre of a flax leaf) round the neck of the  image and stuck it in the ground. He sat at a little distance from it,  leaning against a tuahu, a short stone pillar stuck in the ground in a  slanting position and, holding the string in his hand, he gave the god a  jerk to arrest his attention, lest he should be otherwise engaged, like  Baal of old, either hunting, fishing, or sleeping, and therefore must  be awaked.... The god is supposed to make use of the priest's tongue in  giving a reply. Image-worship appears to have been confined to one part  of the island. The Atua was supposed only to enter the image for the  occasion. The natives declare they did not worship the image itself, but  only the Atua it represented, and that the image was merely used as a  way of approaching him.\" [22]    This is the excuse for image-worship which the more intelligent  idolaters make all the world over; but it is more interesting to observe  that, in the present case, we seem to have the equivalents of divination  by teraphim, with the aid of something like an ephod (which, however, is  used to sanctify the image and not the priest) mixed up together. Many  Hebrew archaeologists have supposed that the term \"ephod\" is sometimes  used for an image (particularly in the case of Gideon's ephod), and the  story of Micah, in the book of Judges, shows that images were, at any  rate, employed in close association with the ephod. If the pulling of  the string to call the attention of the god seems as absurd to us as  it appears to have done to the worthy missionary, who tells us of the  practice, it should be recollected that the high priest of Jahveh was  ordered to wear a garment fringed with golden bells.         And it shall be upon Aaron to minister; and the sound thereof     shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before     Jahveh, and when he cometh out, that he die not (Exod.     xxviii. 35).    An escape from the obvious conclusion suggested by this passage has  been sought in the supposition that these bells rang for the sake of  the worshippers, as at the elevation of the host in the Roman Catholic  ritual; but then why should the priest be threatened with the well-known  penalty for inadvisedly beholding the divinity?    In truth, the intermediate step between the Maori practice and that of  the old Israelites is furnished by the Kami temples in Japan. These are  provided with bells which the worshippers who present themselves ring,  in order to call the attention of the ancestor-god to their presence.  Grant the fundamental assumption of the essentially human character of  the spirit, whether Atua, Kami, or Elohim, and all these practices are  equally rational.    The sacrifices to the gods in Tonga, and elsewhere in Polynesia, were  ordinarily social gatherings, in which the god, either in his own person  or in that of his priestly representative, was supposed to take part.  These sacrifices were offered on every occasion of importance, and even  the daily meals were prefaced by oblations and libations of food and  drink, exactly answering to those offered by the old Romans to their  manes, penates, and lares. The sacrifices had no moral significance,  but were the necessary result of the theory that the god was either a  deified ghost of an ancestor or chief, or, at any rate, a being of like  nature to these. If one wanted to get anything out of him, therefore,  the first step was to put him in good humour by gifts; and if one  desired to escape his wrath, which might be excited by the most trifling  neglect or unintentional disrespect, the great thing was to pacify  him by costly presents. King Finow appears to have been somewhat of a  freethinker (to the great horror of his subjects), and it was only his  untimely death which prevented him from dealing with the priest of a  god, who had not returned a favourable answer to his supplications,  as Saul dealt with the priests of the sanctuary of Jahveh at Nob.  Nevertheless, Finow showed his practical belief in the gods during the  sickness of a daughter, to whom he was fondly attached, in a"]]]
