In a free college (and the New-York Free Academy is, in all respects,  more justly to be considered a college than are most of the schools  which confer academical \"honors\"), in a free college, of which the  professors are responsible only to a judicious board of directors,  examinations for admissions and for advancements will be rigid and  impartial, the administration will be vigilant and firm, the reckless  who will not and the imbecile who cannot acquire a good education, will  be dismissed for more congenial pursuits, the rich and the poor will be  upon an equality, and only desert will be honorably distinguished.    The New-York Free Academy is eminently fortunate in its officers. HORACE  WEBSTER, LL. D., is, in all respects, admirably fitted for his position  as its President. He perfectly understands the indispensableness of  thorough organization, and absolute and watchful discipline. Dr. Webster  is a native of Vermont, and is of that family which, in various  departments, has furnished the country some of its most illustrious  names. At an early age, he became a student of the Military Academy, and  so has himself experience of the advantages of that system which he  advocates, and illustrates in his own administration. He graduated with  distinction, and it is properly mentioned as an indication of his  standing at West Point that, while he was a cadet of the first class, he  was selected by the government of the Academy to be temporarily himself  an instructor. In 1818 he joined the army, as a lieutenant, and after  passing one year with his regiment, of which the late General Taylor was  at that time the Major, he was elected Assistant Professor of  Mathematics in the Military Academy, and returned to fulfil for six  years, with constantly increasing reputation, both for scientific  abilities and for personal character, the duties of that office, which  it scarcely need be said are more difficult at West Point than in any  other school in America. Among the distinguished gentlemen who were  associated with him in teaching or as students during this period, were  General Worth, Colonel Bliss, Colonel Thayer, Colonel Mansfield, and  Professors Alexander D. Bache, LL. D., Charles Davies, LL. D., E. C.  Ross, LL. D., and John Torrey, LL. D. Resigning his commission, he was  in 1825 made Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in Geneva  College, and he filled this place twenty-three years, leaving it in  1848, to accept the Presidency of the New York Free Academy. We conceive  that nothing could have invested this school with a higher claim to  respect, or challenged for it a larger degree of confidence, than the  selection of a man of such experience, capacities, and reputation, to be  its chief officer; and for the class of persons likely to come under his  instruction, no course of study could be more judicious, no training  more admirably adapted, than may be expected from one who has been so  long and so successfully engaged in preparing men for the most difficult  and important offices. His attainments needed no illustration, and his  administrative abilities have been amply vindicated by his government of  the Free Academy.    Candidates for admission to the Free Academy must have passed at least  one year in the public schools, and they are examined in the common  English studies. The standards for admission are not so high as the  colleges demand, because the period of instruction is longer. We cannot  enter into any particular statement of the courses of study, but it  will be interesting if we indicate their character very briefly, and  describe the chief teachers. Edward C. Ross, LL. D., the Professor of  Mathematics, is, like Dr. Webster, a graduate of the Military Academy,  and was many years a successful teacher in that institution and in  Kenyon College. He is assisted by G. B. Docherty, A. M., who was  formerly the Principal of the Flushing Institute. The course embraces  all the studies necessary for the best accomplishment in engineering,  and indeed is as thorough and complete as that pursued at West Point,  with the modifications appropriate to the prospective pursuits of the  pupils. Theodore Irving, A. M., is Professor of History and  Belles-Lettres, assisted by Edward C. Marshall, A. M., and G. W.  Huntsman, A. M. These gentlemen have experience, and we believe their  system of instruction is in some respects original and in every way very  excellent. Mr. Irving is a kinsman of \"Geoffrey Crayon,\" and himself  master of a pleasing and classical style. Oliver Wolcott Gibbs, A. M.,  M. D., Professor of Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Mineralogy, and  Geology, is one of the best practical chemists in this country, having  completed his own education under the celebrated Liebig, in Germany, and  since in many ways evinced such capacities in this department, as made  his selection for the place he occupies almost a matter of course. John  J. Owen, D. D., whose scholarship is exhibited in his ably edited series  of the classical authors of these languages, is Professor of Greek and  Latin, and we neither agree with nor have much respect for those who  deprecate the attention demanded in the Academy for such studies. The  French, Spanish and German languages are taught by Professors Roemer,  Morales, and Glaubensklee, all of whom are known to the public for such  talents as are necessary in their positions. Mr. Paul P. Duggan, a  painter whose works adorn many of our best collections in art, is  Professor of Drawing.    The Free Academy will fulfil the reasonable expectations of its  founders. It is admirably designed, and its appointments and  administration have thus far been judicious. We lack yet a University:  there is no school in America deserving this title; all our colleges  should be regarded as _gymnasia_, sifting the classes of the common  schools and preparing their more advanced and ingenious pupils for such  an institution; and the Free Academy may be accepted as a model by which  they can be reshaped for their less ambitious but more appropriate  duties. This is a subject ably and properly treated in Professor  Tappan's recent volume on Education, (published by Mr. Putnam,) to which  we beg attention.    The whole number of students now attending the Free Academy is three  hundred and twenty-nine, of whom one hundred and five were admitted at  the last examination, in February. The number for whom the building is  designed is about six hundred.          Authors and Books.      A book which we cannot too highly recommend is the _Briefe ueber  Humboldt's Kosmos_ (Letters on Humboldt's Cosmos), published at Leipzic,  in two octavo volumes, from the pens of Professor COTTA and Professor  SCHALLER. It is intended to serve as a commentary upon that work, which  it is well worthy to accompany. Without attempting an exhaustive  treatise on the details of the various topics touched on by Humboldt,  the writers have expanded some of the leading points of his work into  scientific essays, whose practical utility is none the smaller for an  elegant and attractive style, and a genial enthusiasm, of which Humboldt  need not be ashamed. The first volume, by Professor Cotta, contains  forty letters on the following themes: The enjoyment of nature; matter  and forces, growth and existence; natural philosophy; the fixed stars,  their parallaxes, groups, movements, nebulae; double stars, structure of  the universe, resisting medium; the solar system; the laws of motion,  Kepler and Newton; density of the heavenly bodies; our moon, its orbit,  no atmosphere, no water; comets; meteors, and meteoric stones; form of  the earth; magnetism; volcanic activity; gas-springs; geysers; internal  structure of the earth; history of organisms, their first origin, and  developments; the surface, its forms, and their influence on animated  life; the gradual rising and sinking of the surface in Sweden; the  tides; circulation of water on the earth--springs, cold, warm, mineral,  artesian--rivers, seas, ocean currents, evaporation and condensation;  glaciers; the atmosphere, climate, weather, winds, storm-clouds; organic  life on the earth, its nature, differences, origin of the differences,  original production, creation, first appearance; man, his origin, races,  forms, phrenology, &c. These letters offer, as we have already said, in  a pleasing and attractive form, a condensed and comprehensive view of  what is now known with reference to the sciences treated. The letter  upon Man is especially interesting. Professor Cotta belongs to those who  think the human race to be \"the gradual perfection, through thousands of  generations,\" of a lower order of creatures. \"The human individual,\" he  says, \"even now, in the embryonic state, passes through the condition of  various sorts of animals. The most eminent anatomists have shown that  before birth we for a time resemble a polypal animal, then for a time a  fish, next a reptile, till at last appear the characteristics of a  mammalia. This is a fact which bears strongly in favor of our view. The  genesis and development of the entire species seem to be here condensed  in the growth of the individual.\" But while setting forth this peculiar  view, Professor Cotta, with true German comprehensiveness, takes care to  give a fair statement of opposing doctrines, and evinces nothing like a  narrow dogmatism. The second volume, like the second volume of the  Cosmos, is that which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24923"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Vol. I. (#7)"],[1,"the line of their march from the north  reclaimed, as we have seen, at least two N. American species of Canidae.    Turning to the Old World, some European dogs closely resemble the wolf;  thus the shepherd dog of the plains of Hungary is white or reddish-brown,  has a sharp nose, short, erect ears, shaggy coat, and bushy tail, and so  much resembles a wolf that Mr. Paget, who gives this description, says he  has known a Hungarian mistake a wolf for one of his own dogs. Jeitteles,  also, remarks on the close similarity of the Hungarian dog and wolf.  Shepherd dogs in Italy must anciently have closely resembled wolves, for  Columella (vii. 12) advises that white dogs be kept, adding, \"pastor album  probat, ne pro lupo canem feriat.\" Several accounts have been given of dogs  and wolves crossing naturally; and Pliny asserts that the Gauls tied their  female dogs in the woods that they might cross with wolves.[23] The  European wolf differs slightly from that of North America, and has been  ranked by many naturalists as a distinct species. The common wolf of India  is also by some esteemed as a third species, and here again we find a  marked resemblance between the pariah dogs of certain districts of India  and the Indian wolf.[24]    With respect to Jackals, Isidore Geoffroy Saint Hilaire[25] says that not  one constant difference can be pointed out between their structure and that  of the smaller races of dogs. They agree closely in habits: jackals, when  tamed and called by their {25} master, wag their tails, crouch, and throw  themselves on their backs; they smell at the tails of dogs, and void their  urine sideways.[26] A number of excellent naturalists, from the time of  Gueldenstaedt to that of Ehrenberg, Hemprich, and Cretzschmar, have expressed  themselves in the strongest terms with respect to the resemblance of the  half-domestic dogs of Asia and Egypt to jackals. M. Nordmann, for instance,  says, \"Les chiens d'Awhasie ressemblent etonnamment a des chacals.\"  Ehrenberg[27] asserts that the domestic dogs of Lower Egypt, and certain  mummied dogs, have for their wild type a species of wolf (_C. lupaster_) of  the country; whereas the domestic dogs of Nubia and certain other mummied  dogs have the closest relation to a wild species of the same country, viz.  _C. sabbar_, which is only a form of the common jackal. Pallas asserts that  jackals and dogs sometimes naturally cross in the East; and a case is on  record in Algeria.[28] The greater number of naturalists divide the jackals  of Asia and Africa into several species, but some few rank them all as one.    I may add that the domestic dogs on the coast of Guinea are fox-like  animals, and are dumb.[29] On the east coast of Africa, between lat. 4 deg. and  6 deg. south, and about ten days' journey in the interior, a semi-domestic dog,  as the Rev. S. Erhardt informs me, is kept, which the natives assert is  derived from a similar wild animal. Lichtenstein[30] says that the dogs of  the Bosjemans present a striking resemblance even in colour (excepting the  black stripe down the back) with the _C. mesomelas_ of South Africa. Mr. E.  Layard informs me that he has seen a Caffre dog which closely resembled an  Esquimaux dog. In Australia the Dingo is both domesticated and wild; though  this animal may have been introduced aboriginally by man, yet it must be  considered as almost an endemic form, for its remains have been found in a  similar state of preservation and associated with {26} extinct mammals, so  that its introduction must have been ancient.[31]    From this resemblance in several countries of the half-domesticated dogs to  the wild species still living there,--from the facility with which they can  often be crossed together,--from even half-tamed animals being so much  valued by savages,--and from the other circumstances previously remarked on  which favour their domestication, it is highly probable that the domestic  dogs of the world have descended from two good species of wolf (viz. _C.  lupus_ and _C. latrans_), and from two or three other doubtful species of  wolves (namely, the European, Indian, and North African forms); from at  least one or two South American canine species; from several races or  species of the jackal; and perhaps from one or more extinct species. Those  authors who attribute great influence to the action of climate by itself  may thus account for the resemblance of the domesticated dogs and native  animals in the same countries; but I know of no facts supporting the belief  in so powerful an action of climate.    It cannot be objected to the view of several canine species having been  anciently domesticated, that these animals are tamed with difficulty: facts  have been already given on this head, but I may add that the young of the  _Canis primaevus_ of India were tamed by Mr. Hodgson,[32] and became as  sensible to caresses, and manifested as much intelligence, as any sporting  dog of the same age. There is not much difference, as we have already shown  and shall immediately further see, in habits between the domestic dogs of  the North American Indians and the wolves of that country, or between the  Eastern pariah dogs and jackals, or between the dogs which have run wild in  various countries and the several natural species of the family. The habit  of barking, however, which is almost universal with domesticated {27} dogs,  and which does not characterise a single natural species of the family,  seems an exception; but this habit is soon lost and soon reacquired. The  case of the wild dogs on the island of Juan Fernandez having become dumb  has often been quoted, and there is reason to believe[33] that the dumbness  ensued in the course of thirty-three years; on the other hand, dogs taken  from this island by Ulloa slowly reacquired the habit of barking. The  Mackenzie-river dogs, of the _Canis latrans_ type, when brought to England,  never learned to bark properly; but one born in the Zoological Gardens[34]  \"made his voice sound as loudly as any other dog of the same age and size.\"  According to Professor Nillson,[35] a wolf-whelp reared by a bitch barks.  I. Geoffroy Saint Hilaire exhibited a jackal which barked with the same  tone as any common dog.[36] An interesting account has been given by Mr. G.  Clarke[37] of some dogs run wild on Juan de Nova, in the Indian Ocean;  \"they had entirely lost the faculty of barking; they had no inclination for  the company of other dogs, nor did they acquire their voice,\" during a  captivity of several months. On the island they \"congregate in vast packs,  and catch sea-birds with as much address as foxes could display.\" The feral  dogs of La Plata have not become dumb; they are of large size, hunt single  or in packs, and burrow holes for their young.[38] In these habits the  feral dogs of La Plata resemble wolves and jackals; both of which hunt  either singly or in packs, and burrow holes.[39] These feral dogs have not  become uniform in colour on Juan Fernandez, Juan de Nova, or La Plata.[40]  In Cuba the feral dogs are described by Poeppig as nearly all  mouse-coloured, with short ears and light-blue eyes. {28} In St. Domingo,  Col. Ham. Smith says[41] that the feral dogs are very large, like  greyhounds, of a uniform pale blue-ash, with small ears, and large  light-brown eyes. Even the wild Dingo, though so anciently naturalised in  Australia, \"varies considerably in colour,\" as I am informed by Mr. P. P.  King: a half-bred Dingo reared in England[42] showed signs of wishing to  burrow.        From the several foregoing facts we see that reversion in the feral      state gives no indication of the colour or size of the aboriginal      parent-species. One fact, however, with respect to the colouring of      domestic dogs, I at one time hoped might have thrown some light on      their origin; and it is worth giving, as showing how colouring follows      laws, even in so anciently and thoroughly domesticated an animal as the      dog. Black dogs with tan-coloured feet, whatever breed they may belong      to, almost invariably have a tan-coloured spot on the upper and inner      corners of each eye, and their lips are generally thus coloured. I have      seen only two exceptions to this rule, namely, in a spaniel and      terrier. Dogs of a light-brown colour often have a lighter,      yellowish-brown spot over the eyes; sometimes the spot is white, and in      a mongrel terrier the spot was black. Mr. Waring kindly examined for me      a stud of fifteen greyhounds in Suffolk: eleven of them were black, or      black and white, or brindled, and these had no eye-spots; but three      were red and one slaty-blue, and these four had dark-coloured spots      over their eyes. Although the spots thus sometimes differ in colour,      they strongly tend to be tan-coloured; this is proved by my having seen      four spaniels, a setter, two Yorkshire shepherd dogs, a large mongrel,      and some fox-hounds, coloured black and white, with not a trace of      tan-colour, excepting the spots over the eyes, and sometimes a little      on the feet. These latter cases, and many others, show plainly that the      colour of the feet and the eye-spots are in some way correlated. I have      noticed, in various breeds, every gradation, from the whole face being      tan-coloured, to a complete ring round the eyes, to a minute spot over      the inner and upper corners. The spots occur in various sub-breeds of      terriers and spaniels; in setters; in hounds of various kinds,      including the turnspit-like German badger-hound; in shepherd dogs; in a      mongrel, of which neither parent had the spots; in one pure bulldog,      though the spots were in this case almost white; and in      greyhounds,--but true black-and-tan greyhounds are excessively rare;      nevertheless I have been assured by Mr. Warwick, that one ran at the      Caledonian Champion meeting of April, 1860, and was \"mar"]]]
