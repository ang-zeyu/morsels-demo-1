Toward evening one day, while the stevedores were busy handling wood, we  went ashore and visited an Eskimo family in their hut. It was built on  the high river bank among the trees, quite near the steamer's landing.  On the roof of the hut, there lay, stretched on sticks to dry, a large  brown bear skin. Near by we saw the head of a freshly killed moose, with  the hoofs of the animal still bloody.    [Illustration: YUKON STEAMER \"HANNAH.\"]    As we stooped to enter the low door of the cabin, we felt the warmth  from the fire in the little Yukon stove which was placed in the corner  of the room. Next to this was a rude table, on which lay a quarter of  moose meat, looking more or less tempting to travelers living on canned  goods.    A bed stood in one corner, upon which two or three little children were  playing, and upon a pile of rags and skins on the floor sat an old  Eskimo woman, wrinkled and brown. These were her children and  grandchildren, and she was spending her life on the floor of the cabin,  watching the little ones play around her, for she was paralyzed.    There were no chairs in the cabin, and but few rude utensils and  playthings. A box or tin can, which had contained provisions, was now  and then utilized.    After a few moments with the Eskimos, we backed out into the open air  again, for the atmosphere of the hut was peculiar, and not altogether  agreeable to our southern olfactories. It reminded us of Mrs. Peary's  description of native smells in Greenland.    The short path back to our steamer lay through a poplar grove, and  under our feet was spread a carpet of brown and yellow leaves, which, in  the cool night air, smelled ripe and woodsy.    Next came Fort Hamlin, where we again saw some of Uncle Sam's boys, and  where we trudged out through the soft light snow and took some kodak  views.    Rampart City was reached in the early evening. One long row of houses  upon the south bank of the Yukon, near the mouth of the Big Minook Creek  constitutes the town. Here empty the Little Minook, Alder, Hunter, and  many other gold-bearing creeks, and a bustling town sprung up only to be  almost depopulated during the Nome excitement.    By this time several inches of snow had fallen, and the ground was  freezing. We managed here to climb the slippery steps of the log store  building in the dusk and buy a pound of ordinary candy, for which we  paid one dollar.    Again we were in deep water. This time so very smooth that the hills,  peaks, trees and islands were all mirrored on its surface, and very  beautiful.    The days were now quite short. About five in the afternoon the electric  lights were turned on through the steamer, fresh coal again piled on the  fires, and we reminded ourselves how comfortably we were traveling.    Then the dinner bell rang, and we sat down to dinner. Some attempt at  decoration had been made, for tall glasses stood in the centre of the  tables filled with ripe grasses and pretty autumn leaves, but, strange  to relate, we were more interested in the contents of our soup plates  and what was to follow. The cold and bracing air during our short walks  on deck had given us all famous appetites, and we relished everything.    After hot soup with crackers, we ate of fresh fish, three kinds of  canned meats, baked or boiled potatoes, with one other kind of  vegetable, canned tomatoes, corn or beans. Side dishes consisted of  pickles, olives, cheese, sardines, canned fruits, fancy crackers or  biscuits, and afterward came pudding and pie. These last were made from  various canned fruits, and with the rice, sago or tapioca pudding,  formed most enjoyable desserts. On Sunday nuts and raisins or apples  were added to the menu.    If we ate with keen appetites, we were not too much occupied to take  note of the passengers around us. Nearly opposite sat a beautiful woman  with a profusion of auburn hair piled high on her head. She was  fashionably dressed in black silk or satin, and her white fingers were  loaded with costly rings. As she handed a dish to the man beside her,  her diamonds and other gems sparkled brightly. Her companion, much  older, had a hard and villainous face. A heavy frown of displeasure  habitually rested upon his brow, and his glance was shifting and  evasive. He was a professional gambler, kept his game running  continually, and was going to Nome.    At the end of the table sat a tall and pleasant mannered young  Englishman, with blue eyes and ruddy cheeks. He represented mining  interests in the Klondyke amounting to millions, and was on his way to  London. He was fond of wine, and consorted chiefly with those who were  fast bringing him down to their level.    There was the girl with pretty black eyes, lady-like movements, low  voice, and exquisite toilettes. A blue-eyed, pretty little blonde, with  infantile complexion, small hands and feet, and wearing a tailor-made  suit attracted considerable attention. She was fond of cigarettes and  smoked many times a day, though she only looked \"sweet sixteen.\" They  were both dance-house girls.    There was a young and handsome Englishman in the triggest of dude  toggery, but having a squaw wife and three children, as well as older  men at the head of similar broods.    The long tables were spread two or three times at each meal, as several  hundred people were to be fed.    A different class, and a worst one if possible, was met with at these  late meals. Do you see that short, fat woman over there with the bleared  eyes, and the neck of a prize fighter? She is a Dawson saloon keeper,  and is now on her way to Nome.    But there were a number of people on the steamer not properly  belonging to this set, and after supper a few usually gathered in one  corner to listen to each other's experiences in the far Northwest. Some  were tales of hardship, sickness and death; some of hair-breadth escapes  from the jaws of an Arctic winter, or from shipwreck. One told of  having, two years before, paid $175 for five sacks of flour in the  Klondyke; selling the same, a few days later, for $500. Stories of rich  strikes were related; how one man, while drunk, was persuaded by his  associates to trade a valuable claim for one apparently worthless; his  indescribable feelings the next day and until he had prospected the  so-called worthless claim, when it proved ten times richer than the  first one.    [Illustration: FELLOW TRAVELERS.]    A little middle-aged Norwegian woman told her story with great gusto.  She had sailed from Seattle two years before with Mayor Woods'  expedition, getting as far as a point on the Yukon River two hundred  miles below Rampart City. Here the low water prevented their going  farther. She, in company with others, made her way to Rampart as best  she could, rested and \"outfitted\" for a trip to Dawson over the ice.  Finally, with sleds and provisions, eight dogs and four men, she  started. It was a journey of about eight hundred miles. Before leaving  Rampart she experimented with fur sleeping bags, and finally made one in  which she could sleep comfortably on the ice and snow. Rice and tea were  their staple articles of diet, being more quickly prepared in hasty  camps at night, and being found most nourishing. After a perilous trip  of thirty-five days in the dead of winter, they reached Dawson in good  shape, two days ahead of a party of men with whom a wager had been made.  With these, and similar stories, we whiled away the long evening hours  by the fire. Many short stops were made along the river. A few little  settlements were passed during the night. At Holy Cross and Russian  Mission we saw flourishing Catholic schools for the natives.    The Yukon was now getting wider and wider, the water was shallow and  more shallow, then suddenly we felt a heavy jar. The big stern wheel  refused to move,--we were stuck fast on a sand-bar! Here we remained all  day, dreading a hard freeze which was liable to settle down upon us at  any time, fixing our boat and us in the ice indefinitely. But we were  now in the Aphoon, or eastern mouth of the Yukon, and near enough to  Behring Sea to get the benefit of the tides; so that in the early  evening we again heard the thud of the big machines,--the steamer  quivered,--the stern wheel again revolved,--we had entered the Behring  Sea!    By four o'clock next morning we were in St. Michael Bay, having covered  the sixty miles from the mouth of the river during the night. Snow was  falling heavily through which we saw the lights of the harbor, and a  number of vessels at anchor. By daylight we counted eleven ships and  two revenue cutters lying under the lee of the island.    Breakfast was served on board, and an hour later we went ashore. We now  sought the steamer company's hotel, and had no difficulty in getting  good rooms and seats at table; for we were still in their care, having  bought through tickets to San Francisco. Here we were to wait for the  ocean steamer \"Bertha,\" which was now nearly due from that place, and we  anxiously watched the weather signs hoping all would be favorable, and  that she would very soon put in her appearance.    Our hotel was a new frame building of about forty rooms, lighted by  electricity, having large halls, pleasant double parlors overlooking the  bay, with a good view of incoming ships from the north. Just across the  street stood an old block house or fort containing the funny little  cannon used by the Russians over a hundred years ago. The antiquated  lock on the door, the hundreds of bullet holes in the outer walls, were  all quaintly interesting.    Half a mile south were stores, a hotel, another large company's dock,  and in good weather we tramped over there or north the same distance to  the headquarters of a third company. These three were small settlements  by themselves, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22420"],[0,"The Book of Nature Myths (#7)"],[1,"  and said to herself, \"How sorrowful they look! I wish I knew what  troubles them. The stars and I are never sad, and I do not see why men  should be troubled.\" She listened closely, and she heard the people say,  \"How happy we should be if death never came to us. Death is always  before us.\"    The path of the moon lies across the sky, and she could not leave it to  go to the earth, but she called the white rabbit and said, \"Rabbit,  should you be afraid to go down to the earth?\"    \"No,\" answered the rabbit, \"I am not afraid.\"    \"The people on the earth are troubled because death is before them. Now  will you go to them and whisper, 'The moon dies every night. You can see  it go down into the darkness, but when another night comes, then the  moon rises again,'--can you remember to tell them that?\"    \"Yes,\" said the rabbit, \"I will remember.\"    \"Say this,\" said the moon: \"'The moon dies, but the moon rises again,  and so will you.'\"    The rabbit was so glad to go to the earth that he danced and leaped and  sprang and frolicked, but when he tried to tell the people what the moon  had said, he could not remember, and he said, \"The moon says that she  dies and will not rise again, and so you will die and will not rise  again.\"    The moon saw that the people were still troubled, and she called the  rabbit and asked what he had said to them.    \"I said that as you die and do not rise, so they too will die and not  rise,\" said the rabbit.    \"You did not try to remember, and you must be punished,\" said the moon,  and she fired an arrow tipped with flint at the rabbit.    The arrow struck the rabbit's lip and split it. From that time every  rabbit has had a split lip. The rabbit was afraid of the moon, and he  was afraid of the people on the earth. He had been brave before, but now  he is the most timid of animals, for he is afraid of everything and  everybody.          WHY THE PEETWEET CRIES FOR RAIN.      \"Come to me, every bird that flies,\" said the Great Father. \"There is  work to be done that only my birds can do.\"    The birds were happy that they could do something to please the Great  Father, for they remembered how good he had always been to them. They  flew to him eagerly to ask what they should do for him. \"O Great  Father,\" they sang all together, \"tell us what we can do for you.\"    \"The waters that I have made know not where to go,\" said the Father.  \"Some should go to the seas, some should go to the lakes in the hollows  among the mountains, and some should make rivers that will dance over  the rocks and through the fields on their way to the sea.\"    \"And can even as small a bird as I show them where to go?\" asked the  sparrow eagerly.    \"Yes,\" said the Father, \"even my little humming-bird can help me.\"    Every bird that flies had come to the Father, but the peetweet had come  last because he was lazy.    \"I do not really wish to fly all over the earth,\" said he, \"to show the  waters where to go.\"    \"Oh, I wish I were a bird,\" said a butterfly. \"I should be so glad to do  something for the Father.\"    But the peetweet went on, \"I should think the lakes could find their way  into the hollows of the mountains by themselves.\"    The Father heard the lazy peetweet, and he said, \"Do you not wish to  show the waters where to go?\"    \"They never showed me where to go,\" said the lazy bird. \"I am not  thirsty. Let whoever is thirsty and needs the water help the lakes and  rivers.\"    The other birds all stood still in wonder. \"He will be punished,\" they  whispered.    \"Yes, he must be punished,\" said the Father sadly. Then said he to the  lazy peetweet, \"Never again shall you drink of the water that is in  river or lake. When you are thirsty, you must look for a hollow in the  rock where the rain has fallen, and there only shall you drink.\"    That is why the peetweet flies over river and lake, but ever cries  eagerly, \"Peet-weet, peet-weet!\" for that is his word for \"Rain, rain!\"          WHY THE BEAR HAS A SHORT TAIL.      One cold morning when the fox was coming up the road with some fish, he  met the bear.    \"Good-morning, Mr. Fox,\" said the bear.    \"Good-morning, Mr. Bear,\" said the fox. \"The morning is brighter because  I have met you.\"    \"Those are very good fish, Mr. Fox,\" said the bear. \"I have not eaten  such fish for many a day. Where do you find them?\"    \"I have been fishing, Mr. Bear,\" answered the fox.    \"If I could catch such fish as those, I should like to go fishing, but I  do not know how to fish.\"    \"It would be very easy for you to learn, Mr. Bear,\" said the fox. \"You  are so big and strong that you can do anything.\"    \"Will you teach me, Mr. Fox?\" asked the bear.    \"I would not tell everybody, but you are such a good friend that I will  teach you. Come to this pond, and I will show you how to fish through  the ice.\"    So the fox and the bear went to the frozen pond, and the fox showed the  bear how to make a hole in the ice.    \"That is easy for you,\" said the fox, \"but many an animal could not have  made that hole. Now comes the secret. You must put your tail down into  the water and keep it there. That is not easy, and not every animal  could do it, for the water is very cold; but you are a learned animal,  Mr. Bear, and you know that the secret of catching fish is to keep your  tail in the water a long time. Then when you pull it up, you will pull  with it as many fish as I have.\"    The bear put his tail down into the water, and the fox went away. The  sun rose high in the heavens, and still the bear sat with his tail  through the hole in the ice. Sunset came, but still the bear sat with  his tail through the hole in the ice, for he thought, \"When an animal is  really learned, he will not fear a little cold.\"    It began to be dark, and the bear said, \"Now I will pull the fish out of  the water. How good they will be!\" He pulled and pulled, but not a fish  came out. Worse than that, not all of his tail came out, for the end of  it was frozen fast to the ice.    [Illustration]    He went slowly down the road, growling angrily, \"I wish I could find  that fox;\" but the cunning fox was curled up in his warm nest, and  whenever he thought of the bear he laughed.          WHY THE WREN FLIES CLOSE TO THE EARTH.      One day when the birds were all together, one of them said, \"I have been  watching men, and I saw that they had a king. Let us too have a king.\"    \"Why?\" asked the others.    \"Oh, I do not know, but men have one.\"    \"Which bird shall it be? How shall we choose a king?\"    \"Let us choose the bird that flies farthest,\" said one.    \"No, the bird that flies most swiftly.\"    \"The most beautiful bird.\"    \"The bird that sings best.\"    \"The strongest bird.\"    The owl sat a little way off on a great oak-tree. He said nothing, but  he looked so wise that all the birds cried, \"Let us ask the owl to  choose for us.\"    \"The bird that flies highest should be our king,\" said the owl with a  wiser look than before, and the others said, \"Yes, we will choose the  bird that flies highest.\"    The wren is very small, but she cried even more eagerly than the others,  \"Let us choose the bird that flies highest,\" for she said to herself,  \"They think the owl is wise, but I am wiser than he, and I know which  bird can fly highest.\"    Then the birds tried their wings. They flew high, high up above the  earth, but one by one they had to come back to their homes. It was soon  seen which could fly highest, for when all the others had come back,  there was the eagle rising higher and higher.    \"The eagle is our king,\" cried the birds on the earth, and the eagle  gave a loud cry of happiness. But look! A little bird had been hidden in  the feathers on the eagle's back, and when the eagle had gone as high as  he could, the wren flew up from his back still higher.    \"Now which bird is king?\" cried the wren. \"The one that flew highest  should be king, and I flew highest.\"    The eagle was angry, but not a word did he say, and the two birds came  down to the earth together.    \"I am the king,\" said the wren, \"for I flew higher than the eagle.\" The  other birds did not know which of the two to choose. At last they went  to the oak-tree and asked the owl. He looked to the east, the west, the  south, and the north, and then he said, \"The wren did not fly at all,  for she was carried on the eagle's back. The eagle is king, for he not  only flew highest, but carried the wren on his back.\"    \"Good, good!\" cried the other birds. \"The owl is the wisest bird that  flies. We will do as he says, and the eagle shall be our king.\" The wren  crept away. She thought she was wise before, but now she is really wise,  for she always flies close to the earth, and never tries to do what she  cannot.          WHY THE HOOFS OF THE DEER ARE SPLIT.      The manito of the Indians taught them how to do many things. He told  them how to build wigwams, and how to hunt and to fish. He showed them  how to make jars in which to keep food and water. When little children  came to be with them, it was the manito who said, \"See, this is the way  to make soft, warm cradles for the babies.\"    The good spirit often comes down from his happy home in the sky to watch  the Indians at their work. When each man does as well as he can, the  manito is pleased, but if an Indian is lazy or wicked, the spirit is  angry, and the Indian is always punished in one way or another.    One day when the manito was walking in the forest, he said to himself,  \"Everything is good and happy. The green leaves are whispering merrily  together, the waves are lapping on the shore and laughing, the squirrels  are chattering and laying up their food for winter. Everything loves  me, and the colors of the flowers are brighter when I lay my hand upon  them.\"    Then the manito heard a strange sound. \"I have not often heard that,\"  said he. \"I do not like it. Some one in the forest has wicked thoughts  in his heart.\"    Beside a great rock he saw a "]]]
