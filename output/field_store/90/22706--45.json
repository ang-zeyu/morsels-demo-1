I'm rather interested, and like other  people's views.\"    \"You're not super-sensitive, I hope,\" he remarked, \"because some of  your fellows seem to be awfully touchy.\"    \"Many Australians are; I'm not, now go on.\"    \"Well, I like your men for their wonderful physique.  They are as tough  as the oldest soldiers.  But they're not very respectful, you know.  I  mean, they don't salute; they stalk past with an air of equality and  even contempt.  That's a bad sign in a soldier.\"    \"Yes?\" said Sybil, daintily lighting a neat cigarette and settling down  in her cosy chair.    \"The officers, I hear, are excellent leaders, but, somehow, they don't  quite look the part--sort of mixed, don't you know.  Somehow, their  build and clothes don't give them that distinctive touch which is the  hall-mark of the British officer.  I suppose it's really a question of  breeding.  They say in England it takes five generations to turn out a  gentleman.  Americans seem the same as Australians.  In fact, I've read  that all young and democratic countries are alike.  Don't misunderstand  me, I'm not saying they are _not_ gentlemen.  The life, I suppose,  knocks off the fine points.\"    \"I see,\" said Sybil, turning her face towards him.  \"Then your  conception of a leader is a thin-waisted, well-corseted man, all hair  wash and side--a most perfect and arrogant dandy.  I can't believe that  the tailor, manicurist and barber produce the leader.  And you say that  our boys have not the fine touch about them.  Do you think that really  counts in war?  I think a Tommy wants a man to lead him whether he  looks a Caesar or Bill Sikes.  You really infer that the Australian  blood is coarse and unrefined.  Is that so, Mr. Jones?\"    \"Not exactly.  But look over there.  See these two Australian officers.  They seem ungainly in their clothes, and, apparently, feel awkward and  ill at ease in this show.  They don't respect the polite conventions of  Society, and would turn the place into a sort of cowboy saloon if left  alone.\"    \"What nonsense, Mr. Jones.  And if I didn't feel that there was a hope  of you knowing us better, I would leave you.  What I think you are  suffering from is the conservatism of the Britisher, a truly appalling  defect, as well as a lack of perception.  I grant you that our  Australian tailors are absolutely the limit in turning out a man.  Still, I believe a man can die as gallantly in a flour sack as in a  Bond Street khaki suit.  You say they seem ill at ease, and don't  lounge in their chairs as if to the manner born.  You don't realise  that these men are men of action.  Their life is spent in a hustling  way.  They are workers, not idlers.  Anything suggestive of luxurious  ease is interpreted by them as effeminate.\"    Her companion made as though to speak.  But the girl went on:    \"Now, look here, Mr. Jones, I'll lay an even bet with you that they'll  ride, jump and slice the lemon better than any of your troops in Cairo.  They're practical people, not dreamers who worry about etiquette and  the fine points.  Now just you take a good look at their faces.  You'll  note that they're bronzed, strong, with a cleft in the chin, and a  jaw-bone which speaks volumes.  In fact, their whole make-up suggests a  sort of rude strength, which can face the rough and tumble of life.  They get that from their fathers, who, like my dear old dad, were the  pioneers of Australia.  These men landed poor and had to fight drought,  aborigines, bushrangers, misfortune after misfortune.  They were up  against it all the time.  They built their houses from the trees, dug  their wells, fenced their land, scraped their pennies to get the  shillings to buy their stock.  In the midst of success, disease often  struck them bare.  Yet they stuck to it.  Gradually the hard times  passed away, and to-day many are wealthy.  My dad is one.  I'm not  proud of his money, but I am proud of the grit and courage that has  made him rich.  These are just the qualities that the soldier must  have.\"    \"Oh, certainly,\" interjected Jones, fascinated by the radiant glow on  the animated features of this most charming girl.  His logic was being  battered to death.  He felt his position weakening.  It began to dawn  on him that he was a conservative Britisher, who had simply been  uttering the parrot talk of hide-bound Tories.  \"You know, Miss Graham,  you're beginning to make me feel that I should go to Australia.\"    \"If we were there now I would just whisk you away in my car and show  you the Bush.  I do love to convince people, especially folks from the  old land.  Then, Mr. Jones, you would see how free, how charming life  is in the Bush.  We have all got beautiful homes, plenty of horses,  motors, even electric light on some of the stations.  In fact, I know  of one old squatter who can produce a butler and footmen in breeches.  You can have joy rides on motors, picnics miles from civilisation, and  dances with the jolliest band of girls and boys I've seen.  Everything  is natural, all is delightful.  I love Australia.  I'm awfully proud of  it.  And I'm proud of those boys over there and all the others who have  come to help the old land.  Don't judge them by trivial things, Mr.  Jones.  If they're unconventional, and not good at saluting, they'll  stick to any man who can lead them through.  In fact, they can fight  just as the Tommies did at Waterloo and Mons.\"    \"Well,\" said Jones with a gasp, \"you're an absolute revelation.  I have  never quite met your type before.\"    \"I'm different--Australian, eh?\"    \"And very nice too.  That's honey, as you call it.  But I have said it  and you needn't protest,\" he said with boyish enthusiasm.  \"Do you  think the girls would be kind to me if I went to Australia?\"    \"They'd spoil you; they spoil all Englishmen.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because they like them.  They don't pick holes in them as you pick  holes in us.\"    \"I'm sorry, really I'm sorry.  I had no intention to offend.\"    \"You're a good fellow spoiled, as Jack Gordon said.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Mr. Jones, secretly pleased.    \"You know, Mr. Jones, I know a most charming Englishman.  He was our  Jackaroo.  A public school man, he landed at our door and asked for a  job.  He had a glass eye and insisted on wearing that and a white  indiarubber collar when working round the show.  They ragged him, but  he stood it all.  When they went too far he simply took off his jacket  and punched them soft.  No matter what dirty job he got, he did it and  never whined.  He had no airs, and never trumpeted his family lineage  or his school.  He was just a dear, lovable English gentleman, who'd  been a bit foolish at home.  He is here in the Australian contingent;  in fact, he's coming to see me to-night.  Ah! here he is,\" she  gleefully exclaimed, as a tall, well-built soldier, with a monocle,  casually stepped on to the veranda.  \"Come and be introduced?\"    \"What!  To a Tommy,\" said the surprised subaltern.    \"Yes--and a _gentleman_,\" Sybil emphasised.    \"Hallo, dear boy!\"    \"Well, Sybil, what a surprise when I got your wire.\"    \"Let me introduce Mr. Jones of the Yeomanry--Private Dufair.\"    Claud solemnly saluted.  There was a twinkle in his eye as the  surprised subaltern started back, exclaiming, \"What--Claud Dufair?  You  were at Rugby with me!\"    \"The same, sir,\" said Claud, standing rigidly to attention, full of  suppressed mirth.    \"Well, shake, old boy!  How the devil are you?  And, Tommy or no Tommy,  you must have a bottle of fizz with me to-morrow night.  Now, I'm not  going to spoil sport.  I've had an awful wigging from Miss Graham.\"    \"My fiancee,\" interjected Claud.    \"Lucky dog--put me down as your next-of-kin when you make your will.  Good night.\"    \"Good night,\" said the happy couple, passing on to the shade of the  palms, where they renewed that love which is mightier than the sword.          CHAPTER VI    THE WISDOM OF \"K\"    It was a sweltering heat--a day to drink squash and be on a cool  veranda.  But war has no respect for feelings or conditions, so the  Australian, New Zealander, and Lancashire men had to hoof it across the  sun-baked desert.  The troops were divided into three columns, each  striking for a different point.  They were bent on a combined scheme in  which the \"General Idea,\" \"Special Idea,\" and other vague military  terms figured large.    \"Ain't the heat hellish?  My nose is feeling like a banana, and my  shirt's glued to my back!  Wish I had joined the Camel Corps or Donkey  Brigade.  Gravel crushing's no good to me,\" growled Bill, changing his  rifle for the hundredth time.    \"We're suffering for the sins of our predecessors,\" remarked Claud,  shifting his eyeglass to look at the Pyramids.    \"How's that?\"    \"In South Africa the Australians went any old way.  They fought well,  but, as Roberts said, they lacked discipline.  That's why you and I are  here.  They're going to grind the insubordination out of us.  They'll  march us and sweat us to death.  'Trouble maketh a strong man, Pain  maketh a true man,' so some old wag has said.\"    \"Wish ould Kitchener had me thirst, an' this ould pack on his back,\"  growled Doolan.    \"Ay, an' these damnt moskeetes are ay chowin' ma face off,\" said Sandy.    \"Couldn't we have been trained in Australia instead of this confounded  hole?\" added Bill, who was in a nasty mood that day.    \"Too many pubs, too many ma's, and too many politicians about for  that,\" Claud answered.  \"Besides, Kitchener's a smart fellow.  He knows  his job.  We're here to keep these bally niggers in order, and, at the  same time, train for war.  You can't push it on to 'K'; he's too mighty  quick for you an' me.\"    \"But when the blazes are we goin' to the war?

No words were spoken, for  none were necessary. All knew that they would not return until they  had found the man for whom they were looking, even if the chase led  to Canada. They did not ask Buck for any of the particulars, for the  foreman was not in the humor to talk, and all, save Hopalong, whose  curiosity was always on edge, recognized only two facts and cared for  nothing else: Johnny had been ambushed and they were going to get the  one who was responsible.    They did not even conjecture as to who it might be, because the trail  would lead them to the man himself, and it mattered nothing who or what  he was--there was only one course to take with an assassin. So they said  nothing, but rode on with squared jaws and set lips, the seven ponies  breast to breast in a close arc.    Soon they came to an arroyo which they took at a leap. As they  approached it they saw signs in the dust which told them that a body had  lain there huddled up; and there were brown spots on the baked alkali.  The trail they followed was now single, Buck having ridden along the  bank of the arroyo when hunting for Johnny, for whom he had orders. This  trail was very irregular, as if the horse had wandered at will. Suddenly  they came upon five tracks, all pointing one way, and four of these  turned abruptly and disappeared in the northwest. Half a mile beyond the  point of separation was a chaparral, which was an important factor to  them.    Each man knew just what had taken place as if he had been an eyewitness,  for the trail was plain. The assassins had waited in the chaparral for  Johnny to pass, probably having seen him riding that way. When he had  passed and his back had been turned to them they had fired and wounded  him severely at the first volley, for Johnny was of the stuff that  fights back and his revolvers had showed full chambers and clean barrels  when Red had examined them in the bunk house. Then they had given chase  for a short distance and, from some inexplicable motive, probably fear,  they had turned and ridden off without knowing how bad he was hit. It  was this trail that led to the northwest, and it was this trail that  they followed without pausing.    When they had covered fifty miles they sighted the Cross Bar O ranch  where they hoped to secure fresh mounts. As they rode up to the ranch  house the owner, Bud Wallace, came around the corner and saw them.     \"Hullo, boys! What deviltry are yu up to now?\" he asked.  Buck  leaped from his mount, followed by the others, and shoved his sombrero  back on his head as he started to remove the saddle.    \"We're trailin' a bunch of murderers. They ambushed Johnny an' blame  near killed him. I stopped here to get fresh cayuses.\"    \"Yu did right!\" replied Wallace heartily. Then raising his voice he  shouted to some of his men who were near the corral to bring up the  seven best horses they could rope. Then he told the cook to bring out  plenty of food and drink.    \"I got four punchers what ain't doin' nothin' but eat,\" he suggested.    \"Much obliged, Wallace, but there's only four of 'em, an' we'd rather  get 'em ourselves--Johnny'ud feel better,\" replied Buck, throwing his  saddle on the horse that was led up to him.    \"How's yore cartridges--got plenty?\" Persisted Wallace.    \"Two hundred apiece,\" responded Buck, springing into his saddle and  riding off. \"So long,\" he called.    \"So long, an' plug blazes out of them,\" shouted Wallace as the dust  swept over him.    At five in the afternoon they forded the Black River at a point where it  crossed the state line from New Mexico, and at dusk camped at the base  of the Guadalupe Mountains. At daybreak they took up the chase, grim and  merciless, and shortly afterward they passed the smoldering remains of  a camp fire, showing that the pursued had been in a great hurry, for it  should have been put out and masked. At noon they left the mountains to  the rear and sighted the Barred Horeshoe, which they approached.    The owner of the ranch saw them coming, and from their appearance  surmised that something was wrong.    \"What is it?\" He shouted. \"Rustlers?\"    \"Nope. Murderers. I wants to swap cayuses quick,\" answered Buck.    \"There they are. Th' boys just brought 'em in. Anything else I can let  yu have?\"    \"Nope,\" shouted Buck as they galloped off.    \"Somebody's goin' to get plugged full of holes,\" murmured the ranch  owner as he watched them kicking up the dust in huge clouds.    After they had forded a tributary of the Rio Penasco near the Sacramento  Mountains and had surmounted the opposite bank, Hopalong spurred his  horse to the top of a hummock and swept the plain with Pete's field  glasses, which he had borrowed for the occasion, and returned to the  rest, who had kept on without slacking the pace. As he took up his  former position he grunted, \"War-whoops,\" and unslung his rifle, an  example followed by the others.    The ponies were now running at top speed, and as they shot over a rise  their riders saw their quarry a mile and a half in advance. One of the  Indians looked back and discharged his rifle in defiance, and it now  became a race worthy of the name--Death fled from Death. The fresher  mounts of the cowboys steadily cut down the distance and, as the rifles  of the pursuers began to speak, the hard-pressed Indians made for the  smaller of two knolls, the plain leading to the larger one being too  heavily strewn with bowlders to permit speed.    As the fugitives settled down behind the rocks which fringed the edge of  their elevation a shot from one of them disabled Billy's arm, but had no  other effect than to increase the score to be settled. The pursuers  rode behind a rise and dismounted, from where, leaving their mounts  protected, they scattered out to surround the knoll.    Hopalong, true to his curiosity, finally turned up on the highest point  of the other knoll, a spur of the range in the west, for he always  wanted to see all he could. Skinny, due to his fighting instinct,  settled one hundred yards to the north and on the same spur. Buck lay  hidden behind an enormous bowlder eight hundred yards to the northeast  of Skinny, and the same distance southeast of Buck was Red Connors, who  was crawling up the bed of an arroyo. Billy, nursing his arm, lay in  front of the horses, and Pete, from his position between Billy and  Hopalong, was crawling from rock to rock in an endeavor to get near  enough to use his Colts, his favorite and most effective weapons.  Intermittent puffs of smoke arising from a point between Skinny and Buck  showed where Lanky Smith was improving each shining hour.    There had been no directions given, each man choosing his own position,  yet each was of strategic worth. Billy protected the horses, Hopalong  and Skinny swept the knoll with a plunging fire, and Lanky and Buck lay  in the course the besieged would most likely take if they tried a dash.  Off to the east Red barred them from creeping down the arroyo, and from  where Pete was he could creep up to within sixty yards if he chose the  right rocks. The ranges varied from four hundred yards for Buck to sixty  for Pete, and the others averaged close to three hundred, which allowed  very good shooting on both sides.    Hopalong and Skinny gradually moved nearer to each other for  companionship, and as the former raised his head to see what the others  were doing he received a graze on the ear.    \"Wow!\" he yelled, rubbing the tingling member.    Two puffs of smoke floated up from the knoll, and Skinny swore.    \"Where'd he get yu, Fat?\" asked Hopalong.    \"G'wan, don't get funny, son,\" replied Skinny.      Jets of smoke arose from the north and east, where Buck and Red were  stationed, and Pete was half way to the knoll. So far he hadn't been hit  as he dodged in and out, and, emboldened by his luck, he made a run of  five yards and his sombrero was shot from his head. Another dash and his  empty holster was ripped from its support. As he crouched behind a rock  he heard a yell from Hopalong, and saw that interested individual waving  his sombrero to cheer him on. An angry pang! from the knoll caused that  enthusiastic rooter to drop for safety.    \"Locoed son-of-a-gun,\" complained Pete. \"He'll shore git potted.\" Then  he glanced at Billy, who was the center of several successive spurts of  dust.    \"How's business, Billy?\" he called pleasantly.    \"Oh, they'll git me yet,\" responded the pessimist. \"Yu needn't git  anxious. If that off buck wasn't so green he'd 'a' had me long ago.\"    \"Ya-hoo! Pete! Oh, Pete!\" called Hopalong, sticking his head out at one  side and grinning as the wondering object of his hail craned his neck to  see what the matter was.    \"Huh?\" grunted Pete, and then remembering the distance he shouted,  \"What's th' matter?\"    \"Got any cigarettes?\" asked Hopalong.    \"Yu poor sheep!\" said Pete, and turning back to work he drove a .45 into  a yellow moccasin.    Hopalong began to itch and he saw that he was near an ant hill. Then the  cactus at his right boomed out mournfully and a hole appeared in it. He  fired at the smoke and a yell informed him that he had made a hit.  \"Go 'way!\" he complained as a green fly buzzed past his nose. Then he  scratched each leg with the foot of the other and squirmed incessantly,  kicking out with both feet at once. A warning metallic whir-r-r! on his  left caused to yank them in again, and turning his head quickly he the  pleasure of lopping off the head of a rattlesnake with his Colt's.    \"Glad yu wasn't a copperhead,\" he exclaimed. \"Somebody had ought 'a'  shot that fool Noah. Blast the ants!\" He drowned with a jet of tobacco  juice a Gila monster that was staring at him and took a savage delight  in its frantic efforts to bury itself.    Soon he heard Skinny swear and he sung out: \"What's the matter, Skinny?  Git plugged again?\"    \"Naw, bugs--ain't they mean?\" Plaintively asked his"]]]
