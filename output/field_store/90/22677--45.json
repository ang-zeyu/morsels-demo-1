The giant, glad to get rid of him at any cost, agreed, and, loading  himself with gold and silver and precious stones, he set out with the  boy towards his home. When they reached the outskirts of the farms  they saw a herd of cattle, and the giant began to tremble.    \"What sort of beasts are these?\" he asked.    \"They are my father's cows,\" replied Ashpot, \"and you had better put  down your burden and run back to your mountain, or they may bite you.\"    The giant was only too happy to get away, so, depositing his load,  which was as big as a small hill, he made off, and left the boy to  carry his treasure home by himself.    So enormous was the amount of the valuables that it was six years  before Ashpot succeeded in removing everything from the field where  the giant had set it down; but he and all his relations were rich  people for the rest of their lives.            CHAPTER VIII    THE HARDANGER FJORD      All that is grand, all that is beautiful, will be found in the  Hardanger--the \"Smiling Hardanger,\" as the Norwegians themselves call  it; and even if an English visitor went nowhere else, he would have  seen typical Norwegian scenery of every possible kind.    The easiest way to go there is from Bergen, and most people bent  on a tour in Norway make a start either from Christiania or from  Bergen. Bergen itself claims to be the most beautiful town in the  country, and it really is a lovely spot, with its old wooden houses  all around the harbour, full of picturesque shipping, and with its  amphitheatre of bold mountains rising upwards almost from the centre  of the town. But Bergen has its drawbacks, and the principal one is  that it rains every day, or nearly every day.    To reach the Hardanger from Bergen, and to go from one end of the fjord  to the other, you take a passage in one of the comfortable little  local steamers, and you begin your journey early in the morning. It  is a very pleasant way of travelling, as you sit on deck all day and  enjoy the scenery, and only go down to the saloon at meal-times. If  you do not wish to go all the way to the very end of the fjord,  there are numbers of pretty little places where you can break your  journey. But if you like you can travel throughout the day and finish  up late at night at Odda, or at Vik-i-Eidfjord, each of which is at  the head of a branch of the Hardanger Fjord.    Let us take our tickets right through to Eidfjord, make a good long  day of it, and see what there is to be seen. For some little time  after leaving the harbour we see nothing of great interest, only a few  graceful-looking barges in full sail, reminding us of the pictures of  the old Viking ships, and flocks of seagulls fluttering and screaming  round the stern of our boat. Then the steamer begins to pick its way  through the scattered islands, some of which are mere barren granite  rocks, others partially cultivated, and with neat little farmsteads  lying snug in the valleys.    So we go on for an hour or two, occasionally stopping off a small group  of farms, to land, perhaps, a farmer returning from the Bergen market,  or a girl coming home from her situation in the town. Presently we  come alongside a pier under an overhanging cliff, and we see the  name of the place written up on a board, just like the name of a  railway-station. This is Godoesund, a favourite holiday haunt of  the Bergen people. It is not a town or even a village, but just a  chalet-like hotel of two or three buildings, standing on the side  of a fir-clad hill, in the midst of a fairyland of creeks and wooded  islets--as pretty a spot as one could wish to see.    Now we are nearing the Hardanger Fjord; we pass through the narrow  straits known as the Loeksund, and we enter the fjord. Glorious and  ever-changing views open out before us, as hour after hour the steamer  passes from one small station to another, dropping a mail-bag, and  perhaps a passenger or two. We pass farms lying close to the shore,  the wooden houses being in many cases painted red or white, and thus  forming a brilliant contrast to the blue-black mountains and dark  green forests which rise up behind them. We see every now and then  a clean white wooden church, and, away up on the mountain-sides we  can discern tiny specks, which, we are told, are the saeter dwellings.    Sometimes the steamer is out in the middle of the fjord, which, in  parts, is five miles or more in width, but at other times we find  ourselves close in to a rocky precipice, and wondering how it will  be possible to avoid grounding. Above us the mountain-side rises  perpendicularly to a height of, it may be, 3,000 or 4,000 feet;  and, looking down into the clear water, we can see that it is ever  so deep. As a matter of fact, the chart tells us that hereabouts it  is a little more than 2,000 feet in depth.    Soon we reach the bay in which is Rosendal, where one could spend  a very pleasant week or so, with trout fishing to be had in the  streams and lakes, and mountain walks up to the edge of the great  Folgefond snowfield. The steamer calls for a few minutes, and then  goes on up the beautiful little branch fjord known as the Mauranger,  at the extremity of which lies Sundal.    The scenery here is delightful, and especially so at the spot where  the Bondhus Valley is seen stretching down to the fjord. Half-way  up the valley a round-topped mountain appears to bar the way, and  farther off a blue-grey glacier--the Bondhus Brae--is seen falling  from the white snowfield, and choking the head of the vale.    Those who have the mind to do so can wander up to the glacier, sleep  the night at a saeter, and on the following day hire a sleigh, and  career for miles over the vast field of perpetual snow, right across  the headland to Odda. And great is the joy of plunging suddenly,  on a hot August day, into the depths of winter.    But our steamer does not stay here long--only long enough to put some  Norwegian passengers on shore, and take fresh ones on board. This  occupies some time, however, for Norse people, and especially the  ladies, refuse to be hurried. It is amusing to watch them starting  on their travels. All their friends come to see them off, although  it is quite possible that the traveller is only going to the next  station on the fjord, not a dozen miles away. Each friend bears  some small package--a pot of cranberry jam, a basket of apples or  cherries, a bag of cakes, or something of that kind. The gaily-painted  wooden trunks and the _tiners_ are stowed away on board; and then the  \"farvels\" commence, with kisses and handshakes, and pats on the back,  and many last words until the bell rings for the steamer's departure,  when a lady passenger suddenly discovers that she has left something  behind. The wildest confusion follows, and away run all the friends to  fetch it from the house, returning just in time. Then the good-byes  begin again, and as the steamer finally departs, everyone shouts,  \"Farvel! farvel! farvel!\" frequently and rapidly; hats are raised,  and handkerchiefs continue waving until the boat can no longer be seen.    Returning down the Mauranger Fjord we steam out across the main  fjord, and early in the afternoon call at several small places on the  northern shore--Bakke, Vikingnaes, Nordheimsund--each with its spruce  hotel, enticing the traveller to loiter and explore the country in  the neighbourhood. A little later we enter the Fiksensund, a narrow  branch fjord, and a wonder of wonders. For a distance of seven miles  it wends its way amongst the mountains. In places the precipitous  hillsides are within a hundred yards of each other, and in no part is  this extraordinary fjord-arm a third of a mile in width. For thousands  of feet sheer out of the water rise the bold walls of granite, with  here and there a ledge thickly wooded with fir and birch. It looks as  if the mountains had been torn asunder to admit the sea, and local  legends say that a spiteful giantess did this and many other nasty  things in the giant age. Half-way up the fjord the steamer fires a  gun, so that the passengers may hear the echo, and the sound comes  back time after time from every nook and cranny. At the end is Botnen,  with a road running away north to other farms, and eventually to the  railway from Bergen to Vossevangen.    Again we return to the main fjord, and before long enter the  Gravensfjord, wherein lies Eide, a kind of junction of the  steamer-routes, and a very touristy place, as there is a good  driving-road to Voss. The Bergen steamer continues its way up  the Soerfjord to Odda, which is reached late at night; but we,  who are bound for Eidfjord, change into a small branch steamer,  and are soon rounding a mighty headland, and, if there is any wind,  getting a tossing for a few minutes, the fjord just here being wide  and open. The head of a seal may occasionally be seen bobbing up  and down, and large flocks of duck are always swimming about at a  respectful distance from the steamer. And what a view we have across  the expanse of water! The never-ending mountains stretch away one  behind the other, to be crowned in the distance by the dazzling white  snowfield, lighted up by the fast sinking sun.    And when the sun goes down the scenery, as we steam on, changes  each moment. In the twilight the granite cliffs stand out black and  uninviting, and the country looks cold and grey. It may be that  we are tired of the long journey, for with the growing darkness  comes the feeling that something to eat and bed would be pleasant  things. Then the steamer's whistle makes us spring to our feet, and,  peering ahead, we see lights on the Vik jetty and in the hotel close  by. In a few minutes we are in Naesheim's comfortable dining-room,  enjoying our well-deserved supper after a day of days on Norway's  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24681"],[0,"Opportunities in Engineering (#7)"],[1," He goes to the one acknowledged  authority in this line, and in doing so but follows a sane inner  dictation.    And that is consulting work. The individual of money who would launch  into manufacturing, knowing nothing of manufacturing, will, after  deciding as to which branch of manufacturing he wishes to follow,  enlist the services of a consulting engineer big by reputation in this  branch. The capitalist may wish to enter the paper-manufacturing field.  Straightway he will put himself in touch with a consulting engineer  whose specialty is paper-manufacturing plants, and, having informed this  man as to the amount of money he is willing to spend on the venture,  together with the location where he wishes, within certain prescribed  limitations, to have his plant stand, may withdraw from the thing, if he  choose, until the plant is built and in operation. The consulting  engineer has done the rest. He has gone out upon location, seeking sites  with an eye to economy both of power and transportation; he has  supervised the design of the plant and the location in the plant of the  necessary machinery; has enlisted the service of a builder whose task it  is to follow these plans from foundation to roof in the work of actual  construction. For this work the consulting engineer receives a fee,  usually based upon a percentage of the cost, and then turns to other  clients--waiting in his outer office--who would enlist his services in a  similar capacity.    The consulting engineer has other sources of revenue. Like the lawyer,  he is frequently retained by traction and lighting interests to guard  the rights of these interests, service for which he receives payment by  the year. His testimony is valued in matters of litigation, sometimes  patent infringements, sometimes municipal warfare between corporations,  but always of a highly specialized nature. He is an authority, and when  I have said that I have said all. His retainer fees are large; his work  is exact; he is a man looked up to by those in the profession following  a general practice. He has his office, and retains a staff of engineers,  usually young engineers just out of college, who, like himself at one  time, are on their way upward in the game. He is rarely a young man;  generally is a man of wide reading; is a man respected in his community  not for what he knows as an engineer, but for the standard of living  which he is able to set by virtue of his income. Besides the sources of  revenue which are his, and as I have set forth above, he is sought by  technical editors to contribute to magazines powerful in his field, and  this is a pleasurable source of income to any man in any walk of life.  The consulting engineer is a man to be admired and emulated by all  engineering students.    As to the time in life when an engineer feels qualified to enter upon  consulting work, that is something which must come to him from within.  Usually the engineer knows that he has become a factor in his chosen  branch or specialty when he finds himself becoming more and more sought  in an advisory capacity among his fellows. He can judge that he has  become an authority in his work by the simple process of comparing  himself and his work with others and the work of these others in the  field. If he finds that he is designing a better plant or automatic  machine, or more economically operated mine or more serviceable lighting  station than his neighbor, and, together with this knowledge, perceives  also that capitalists are beating a deeper path to his door than to the  doors of his competitors--to warp an Emersonian phrase--then the  handwriting on the wall should be clear to him--to quote the Bible.  Having sufficient capital to carry him through a year or two of personal  venturing in the consulting field, he will open an office and insert his  professional card in the journals in his field--and fly to it. If he be  a man of righteous parts, he will succeed as a consulting engineer--and  can go no higher in the profession.    The game is certainly worth the candle.          VIII    THE ENGINEER IN CIVIC AFFAIRS      Much has been written of late of the engineer as a citizen--of his civic  responsibilities, of his relation to legislation, to administration, to  public opinion, and the like. It is timely writing. The engineer is  about due for active participation in civic affairs other than a yearly  visit to the polls to register his vote. He has not done much more than  this since his inception. His work alone has sufficed, for him, at  least, though the time is past when he can bury himself in his  professional work and, in the vernacular, get away with it. Men of the  stamp of Herbert Hoover have demonstrated the very great need for men of  scientific training in public affairs. Such places heretofore have been  filled with business men and lawyers. These men served and served well.  But since administration of public affairs to-day is largely a matter of  formulation and execution of engineering projects, it is assuredly the  duty of engineers to take an active part in these public affairs.    Exact knowledge, which in a manner of speaking is synonymous with the  engineer, is needed in high places in our nation. Men of technical  education and training have demonstrated their fitness as servants of  the people in the few instances where such men have taken over the reins  of administration in certain specified branches of our government.  Trained to think in terms of figures and the relation of these figures  to life, engineers readily perceive the true and the untrue in matters  of legislation and administration, though as a body they have never  exerted themselves to an expression of their opinions on matters coming  properly under the head of public opinion. Engineers have felt that they  have not had the time. Or, having the time, that the public at large,  chiefly owing to the engineer's self-imposed isolation, would not  understand a voice from this direction, and so engineers have kept  silent. The day has arrived, however, when this silence on the part of  engineers must be broken.    The World War has been an awakening in this as in other directions.  Lawyers and politicians have successfully dominated our government from  its beginning, with a single beautiful exception in George Washington at  one end and another admirable exception in Woodrow Wilson at the other.  Washington was a civil engineer, and Wilson, while trained as a lawyer,  was an educator. In between these two men there may have fallen a  scattering of others who were not lawyers or politicians; the writer is  not sure. Of one thing he is sure, however, and that is that engineers  in the future will dominate politics to the betterment of the nation as  a whole. For engineers are idealists--otherwise they would never have  entered upon an engineering career--and idealism has come, as it were,  into its own again. The man of vision of a wholesome aspect, the man who  can so completely forget himself in his work of service as to engage in  tasks whose merits nobody save himself and those pursuing like tasks can  or will understand--which is pre-eminently the engineer--is the one man  best fitted to administrate in public affairs. More important still than  this statement is the fact that the world at large is beginning to  realize the truth of it. Engineers as a body stand poised upon the rim  of big things. Nor will they as a body stoop to the petty in politics,  once they are fairly well launched in active participation of civic  affairs. Neither their training nor their outlook, based upon their  training, will permit it. For engineers, more than any other group of  professional men, are given to \"see true.\" And seeing true, being, as it  is, the essence of a full life, is what is needed in our public  administrators.    Engineers in the past who have become more or less prominent in the  public eye--and there are some who have--have demonstrated their ability  to see things as they are. Westinghouse was the first man in this  country to foresee the coming of the half-holiday Saturday as an  innovation that promised general adoption. He granted it to all his  employees at a time when lesser industrial captains believed him to be  at least \"queer.\" Ford set the pace for a minimum rate of five dollars a  day in his plant, and lesser captains still frown upon him for having  perpetrated this \"evil.\" Edison, among other things, has told of the  importance of loose clothing--loose shoes and collars and hats--to a man  who would enjoy good health. The list is not long, but the insight of  those who form this short list cannot but be recognized. What these men  have said and done concerning matters freely apart from the subject of  engineering reveals them as members of a fraternity well qualified to  lead public opinion rather than to follow it, as has been the province  of engineers in the past. Each when he has spoken or entered upon action  having the public welfare in mind has pronounced or demonstrated a truth  which fairly crackled with sanity.    Engineers belong in civic affairs. The world of humanity needs men of  their stamp in high places. Humanity needs men in control of state and  national affairs who would hold the interests of humanity sacred.  Engineers are such men. Not that engineers more than any other  professional men are sprouting wings--not that. But engineers do see  things in their true light--cannot see them in any other light than the  one imposed by the law of mathematics, which is that two and two make  four, never five or three--and this involuntarily would admit of  decisions and grant graces from the point of view of absolute truth,  which is, of course, the point of view of humanity--the greatest good  for the greatest number. With such men occupying high places in the  nation's affairs, the world of men and mankind would leap forward  ethically and"]]]
