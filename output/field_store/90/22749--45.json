At the time when Louis XIV was meditating the Revocation of the Edict of  Nantes he felt that the services of such a man would be invaluable to  him, so about 1632, Abbe Duchayla was recalled from India, and a year  later was sent to Mende, with the titles of Arch-priest of the Cevennes  and Inspector of Missions.    Soon the abbe, who had been so much persecuted, became a persecutor,  showing himself as insensible to the sufferings of others as he had been  inflexible under his own. His apprenticeship to torture stood him in  such good stead that he became an inventor, and not only did he enrich  the torture chamber by importing from India several scientifically  constructed machines, hitherto unknown in Europe, but he also designed  many others. People told with terror of reeds cut in the form of  whistles which the abbe pitilessly forced under the nails of malignants;  of iron pincers for tearing out their beards, eyelashes, and eyebrows;  of wicks steeped in oil and wound round the fingers of a victim's hands,  and then set on fire so as to form a pair of five-flamed candelabra; of  a case turning on a pivot in which a man who refused to be converted was  sometimes shut up, the case being then made to revolve rapidly till the  victim lost consciousness; and lastly of fetters used when taking  prisoners from one town to another, and brought to such perfection, that  when they were on the prisoner could neither stand nor sit.    Even the most fervent panegyrists of Abbe Duchayla spoke of him with  bated breath, and, when he himself looked into his own heart and  recalled how often he had applied to the body the power to bind and  loose which God had only given him over the soul, he was seized with  strange tremors, and falling on his knees with folded hands and bowed  head he remained for hours wrapt in thought, so motionless that were it  not for the drops of sweat which stood on his brow he might have been  taken for a marble statue of prayer over a tomb.    Moreover, this priest by virtue of the powers with which he was  invested, and feeling that he had the authority of M. de Baville,  intendant of Languedoc, and M. de Broglie, commander of the troops,  behind him, had done other terrible things.    He had separated children from father and mother, and had shut them up  in religious houses, where they had been subjected to such severe  chastisement, by way of making them do penance for the heresy of their  parents, that many of them died under it.    He had forced his way into the chamber of the dying, not to bring  consolation but menaces; and bending over the bed, as if to keep back  the Angel of Death, he had repeated the words of the terrible decree  which provided that in case of the death of a Huguenot without  conversion, his memory should be persecuted, and his body, denied  Christian burial, should be drawn on hurdles out of the city, and cast  on a dungheap.    Lastly, when with pious love children tried to shield their parents in  the death-agony from his threats, or dead from his justice, by carrying  them, dead or dying, to some refuge in which they might hope to draw  their last breath in peace or to obtain Christian burial, he declared  that anyone who should open his door hospitably to such disobedience was  a traitor to religion, although among the heathen such pity would have  been deemed worthy of an altar.    Such was the man raised up to punish, who went on his way, preceded by  terror, accompanied by torture, and followed by death, through a country  already exhausted by long and bloody oppression, and where at every step  he trod on half repressed religious hate, which like a volcano was ever  ready to burst out afresh, but always prepared for martyrdom. Nothing  held him back, and years ago he had had his grave hollowed out in the  church of St. Germain, choosing that church for his last long sleep  because it had been built by Pope Urban IV when he was bishop of Mende.    Abbe Duchayla extended his visitation over six months, during which  every day was marked by tortures and executions: several prophets were  burnt at the stake; Francoise de Brez, she who had preached that the  Host contained a more venomous poison than a basilisk's head, was  hanged; and Laquoite, who had been confined in the citadel of  Montpellier, was on the point of being broken on the wheel, when on the  eve of his execution his cell was found empty. No one could ever  discover how he escaped, and consequently his reputation rose higher  than ever, it being currently believed that, led by the Holy Spirit as  St. Peter by the angel, he had passed through the guards invisible to  all, leaving his fetters behind.    This incomprehensible escape redoubled the severity of the Arch-priest,  till at last the prophets, feeling that their only chance of safety lay  in getting rid of him, began to preach against him as Antichrist, and  advocate his death. The abbe was warned of this, but nothing could abate  his zeal. In France as in India, martyrdom was his longed-for goal, and  with head erect and unfaltering step he \"pressed toward the mark.\"    At last, on the evening of the 24th of July, two hundred conspirators  met in a wood on the top of a hill which overlooked the bridge of  Montvert, near which was the Arch-priest's residence. Their leader was a  man named Laporte, a native of Alais, who had become a master-blacksmith  in the pass of Deze. He was accompanied by an inspired man, a former  wool-carder, born at Magistavols, Esprit Seguier by name. This man was,  after Laquoite, the most highly regarded of the twenty or thirty  prophets who were at that moment going up and down the Cevennes in every  direction. The whole party was armed with scythes, halberts, and swords;  a few had even pistols and guns.    On the stroke of ten, the hour fixed for their departure, they all knelt  down and with uncovered heads began praying as fervently as if they were  about to perform some act most pleasing to God, and their prayers ended,  they marched down the hill to the town, singing psalms, and shouting  between the verses to the townspeople to keep within their homes, and  not to look out of door or window on pain of death.    The abbe was in his oratory when he heard the mingled singing and  shouting, and at the same moment a servant entered in great alarm,  despite the strict regulation of the Arch-priest that he was never to be  interrupted at his prayers. This man announced that a body of fanatics  was coming down the hill, but the abbe felt convinced that it was only  an unorganised crowd which was going to try and carry off six prisoners,  at that moment in the 'ceps.' [ A terrible kind of stocks--a beam split  in two, no notches being made for the legs: the victim's legs were  placed between the two pieces of wood, which were then, by means of a  vice at each end, brought gradually together. Translators Note.]    These prisoners were three young men and three girls in men's clothes,  who had been seized just as they were about to emigrate. As the abbe was  always protected by a guard of soldiers, he sent for the officer in  command and ordered him to march against, the fanatics and disperse  them. But the officer was spared the trouble of obeying, for the  fanatics were already at hand. On reaching the gate of the courtyard he  heard them outside, and perceived that they were making ready to burst  it in. Judging of their numbers by the sound of their voices, he  considered that far from attacking them, he would have enough to do in  preparing for defence, consequently he bolted and barred the gate on the  inside, and hastily erected a barricade under an arch leading to the  apartments of the abbe. Just as these preparations were complete, Esprit  Seguier caught sight of a heavy beam of wood lying in a ditch; this was  raised by a dozen men and used as a battering-ram to force in the gate,  which soon showed a breach. Thus encouraged, the workers, cheered by the  chants of their comrades, soon got the gate off the hinges, and thus the  outside court was taken. The crowd then loudly demanded the release of  the prisoners, using dire threats.    The commanding officer sent to ask the abbe what he was to do; the abbe  replied that he was to fire on the conspirators. This imprudent order  was carried out; one of the fanatics was killed on the spot, and two  wounded men mingled their groans with the songs and threats of their  comrades.    The barricade was next attacked, some using axes, others darting their  swords and halberts through the crevices and killing those behind; as  for those who had firearms, they climbed on the shoulders of the others,  and having fired at those below, saved themselves by tumbling down  again. At the head of the besiegers were Laporte and Esprit Seguier, one  of whom had a father to avenge and the other a son, both of whom had  been done to death by the abbe. They were not the only ones of the party  who were fired by the desire of vengeance; twelve or fifteen others were  in the same position.    The abbe in his room listened to the noise of the struggle, and finding  matters growing serious, he gathered his household round him, and making  them kneel down, he told them to make their confession, that he might,  by giving them absolution, prepare them for appearing before God. The  sacred words had just been pronounced when the rioters drew near, having  carried the barricade, and driven the soldiers to take refuge in a hall  on the ground floor just under the Arch-priest's room.    But suddenly, the assault was stayed, some of the men going to surround  the house, others setting out on a search for the prisoners. These were  easily found, for judging by what they could hear that their brethren  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2744"],[0,"Mary Stuart (#7)"],[1,"ne,\" said he, showing Darnley his bloody dagger before  putting it back in its sheath, \"for here is the proof that I have well  earned it\". The servant obeyed, and Ruthven drained his glass with as  much calmness as if he had just performed the most innocent act.    \"My lord,\" the queen then said, taking a step towards him, \"it may be  that as I am a woman, in spite of my desire and my will, I never find an  opportunity to repay you what you are doing to me; but,\" she added,  energetically striking her womb with her hand, \"he whom I bear there,  and whose life you should have respected, since you respect my Majesty  so little, will one day revenge me for all these insults\". Then, with a  gesture at once superb and threatening, she withdrew by Darnley's door,  which she closed behind her.    At that moment a great noise was heard in the queen's room. Huntly,  Athol, and Bothwell, who, we are soon about to see, play such an  important part in the sequel of this history, were supping together in  another hall of the palace, when suddenly they had heard outcries and  the clash of arms, so that they had run with all speed. When Athol, who  came first, without knowing whose it was, struck against the dead body  of Rizzio, which was stretched at the top of the staircase, they  believed, seeing someone assassinated, that the lives of the king and  queen were threatened, and they had drawn their swords to force the door  that Morton was guarding. But directly Darnley understood what was going  on, he darted from the cabinet, followed by Ruthven, and showing himself  to the newcomers--    \"My lords,\" he said, \"the persons of the queen and myself are safe, and  nothing has occurred here but by our orders. Withdraw, then; you will  know more about it in time. As to him,\" he added, holding up Rizzio's  head by the hair, whilst the bastard of Douglas lit up the face with a  torch so that it could be recognised, \"you see who it is, and whether it  is worth your while to get into trouble for him\".    And in fact, as soon as Huntly, Athol, and Bothwell had recognised the  musician-minister, they sheathed their swords, and, having saluted the  king, went away.    Mary had gone away with a single thought in her heart, vengeance. But  she understood that she could not revenge herself at one and the same  time on her husband and his companions: she set to work, then, with all  the charms of her wit and beauty to detach the King from his  accomplices. It was not a difficult task: when that brutal rage which  often carried Darnley beyond all bounds was spent, he was frightened  himself at the crime he had committed, and while the assassins,  assembled by Murray, were resolving that he should have that greatly  desired crown matrimonial, Darnley, as fickle as he was violent, and as  cowardly as he was cruel, in Mary's very room, before the scarcely dried  blood, made another compact, in which he engaged to deliver up his  accomplices. Indeed, three days after the event that we have just  related, the murderers learned a strange piece of news--that Darnley and  Mary, accompanied by Lord Seyton, had escaped together from Holyrood  Palace. Three days later still, a proclamation appeared, signed by Mary  and dated from Dunbar, which summoned round the queen, in her own name  and the king's, all the Scottish lords and barons, including those who  had been compromised in the affair of the \"run in every sense,\" to whom  she not only granted full and complete pardon, but also restored her  entire confidence. In this way she separated Murray's cause from that of  Morton and the other assassins, who, in their turn, seeing that there  was no longer any safety for them in Scotland, fled to England, where  all the queen's enemies were always certain to find a warm welcome, in  spite of the good relations which reigned in appearance between Mary and  Elizabeth. As to Bothwell, who had wanted to oppose the assassination,  he was appointed Warden of all the Marches of the Kingdom.    Unfortunately for her honour, Mary, always more the woman than the  queen, while, on the contrary, Elizabeth was always more the queen than  the woman, had no sooner regained her power than her first royal act was  to exhume Rizzio, who had been quietly buried on the threshold of the  chapel nearest Holyrood Palace, and to have him removed to the  burial-place of the Scottish kings, compromising herself still more by  the honours she paid him dead than by the favour she had granted him  living.    Such an imprudent demonstration naturally led to fresh quarrels between  Mary and Darnley: these quarrels were the more bitter that, as one can  well understand, the reconciliation between the husband and wife, at  least on the latter's side, had never been anything but a pretence; so  that, feeling herself in a stronger position still on account of her  pregnancy, she restrained herself no longer, and, leaving Darnley, she  went from Dunbar to Edinburgh Castle, where on June 19th, 1566, three  months after the assassination of Rizzio, she gave birth to a son who  afterwards became James VI.          CHAPTER III      Directly she was delivered, Mary sent for James Melville, her usual  envoy to Elizabeth, and charged him to convey this news to the Queen of  England, and to beg her to be godmother to the royal child at the same  time. On arriving in London, Melville immediately presented himself at  the palace; but as there was a court ball, he could not see the queen,  and contented himself with making known the reason for his journey to  the minister Cecil, and with begging him to ask his mistress for an  audience next day. Elizabeth was dancing in a quadrille at the moment  when Cecil, approaching her, said in a low voice, \"Queen Mary of  Scotland has just given birth to a son\". At these words she grew  frightfully pale, and, looking about her with a bewildered air, and as  if she were about to faint, she leaned against an arm-chair; then, soon,  not being able to stand upright, she sat down, threw back her head, and  plunged into a mournful reverie. Then one of the ladies of her court,  breaking through the circle which had formed round the queen, approached  her, ill at ease, and asked her of what she was thinking so sadly. \"Ah!  madam,\" Elizabeth replied impatiently, \"do you not know that Mary Stuart  has given birth to a son, while I am but a barren stock, who will die  without offspring?\"    Yet Elizabeth was too good a politician, in spite of her liability to be  carried away by a first impulse, to compromise herself by a longer  display of her grief. The ball was not discontinued on that account, and  the interrupted quadrille was resumed and finished.    The next day, Melville had his audience. Elizabeth received him to  perfection, assuring him of all the pleasure that the news he brought  had caused her, and which, she said, had cured her of a complaint from  which she had suffered for a fortnight. Melville replied that his  mistress had hastened to acquaint her with her joy, knowing that she had  no better friend; but he added that this joy had nearly cost Mary her  life, so grievous had been her confinement. As he was returning to this  point for the third time, with the object of still further increasing  the queen of England's dislike to marriage--    \"Be easy, Melville,\" Elizabeth answered him; \"you need not insist upon  it. I shall never marry; my kingdom takes the place of a husband for me,  and my subjects are my children. When I am dead, I wish graven on my  tombstone: 'Here lies Elizabeth, who reigned so many years, and who died  a virgin.'\"    Melville availed himself of this opportunity to remind Elizabeth of the  desire she had shown to see Mary, three or four years before; but  Elizabeth said, besides her country's affairs, which necessitated her  presence in the heart of her possessions, she did not care, after all  she had heard said of her rival's beauty, to expose herself to a  comparison disadvantageous to her pride. She contented herself, then,  with choosing as her proxy the Earl of Bedford, who set out with several  other noblemen for Stirling Castle, where the young prince was  christened with great pomp, and received the name of Charles James.    It was remarked that Darnley did not appear at this ceremony, and that  his absence seemed to scandalise greatly the queen of England's envoy.  On the contrary, James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, had the most important  place there.    This was because, since the evening when Bothwell, at Mary's cries, had  run to oppose the murder of Rizzio, he had made great way in the queen's  favour; to her party he himself appeared to be really attached, to the  exclusion of the two others, the king's and the Earl of Murray's.  Bothwell was already thirty-five years old, head of the powerful family  of Hepburn, which had great influence in East Lothian and the county of  Berwick; for the rest, violent, rough, given to every kind of  debauchery, and capable of anything to satisfy an ambition that he did  not even give himself the trouble to hide. In his youth he had been  reputed courageous, but for long he had had no serious opportunity to  draw the sword.    If the king's authority had been shaken by Rizzio's influence, it was  entirely upset by Bothwell's. The great nobles, following the  favourite's example, no longer rose in the presence of Darnley, and  ceased little by little to treat him as their equal: his retinue was cut  down, his silver plate taken from him, and some officers who remained  about him made him buy their services with the most bitter vexations. As  for the queen, she no longer even took the trouble to conceal her  dislike for him, avoiding him without consideration, to such a degree  that one day when she had gone with Bothwell to Alway, she left there  again immediately, because Darnley came to join her. The king, however,  still had patience; but a fresh imprudence of Mary's at last"]]]
