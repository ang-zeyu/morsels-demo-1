THE EARLY HISTORY OF ATHENS, DOWN TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DEMOCRACY BY  CLISTHENES, B.C. 510.    Sparta was the only state in Greece which continued to retain the  kingly form of government during the brilliant period of Grecian  history.  In all other parts of Greece royalty had been abolished at as  early age, and various forms of republican government established in  its stead.  The abolition of royalty was first followed by an Oligarchy  or the government of the Few. Democracy, or the government of the Many,  was of later growth. It was not from the people that the oligarchies  received their first and greatest blow.  They were generally overthrown  by the usurpers, to whom the Greeks gave the name of TYRANTS.  [The  Greek word Tyrant does not correspond in meaning to the same word in  the English language.  It signifies simply an irresponsible ruler, and  may, therefore, be more correctly rendered by the term Despot.]    The rise of the Tyrants seems to have taken place about the same time  in a large number of the Greek cities.  In most cases they belonged to  the nobles, and they generally became masters of the state by espousing  the cause of the commonalty, and using the strength of the people to  put down the oligarchy by force.  At first they were popular with the  general body of the citizens, who were glad to see the humiliation of  their former masters. But discontent soon began to arise; the tyrant  had recourse to violence to quell disaffection; and the government  became in reality a tyranny in the modern sense of the word.    Many of the tyrants in Greece were put down by the Lacedaemonians.  The  Spartan government was essentially an oligarchy, and the Spartans were  always ready to lend their powerful aid in favour of the government of  the Few.  Hence they took an active part in the overthrow of the  despots, with the intention of establishing the ancient oligarchy in  their place. But this rarely happened; and they found it impossible in  most cases to reinstate the former body of nobles in their ancient  privileges.  The latter, it is true, attempted to regain them and were  supported in their attempts by Sparta.  Hence arose a new struggle.  The first contest after the abolition of royalty was between oligarchy  and the despot, the next was between oligarchy and democracy.    The history of Athens affords the most striking illustration of the  different revolutions of which we have been speaking.    Little is known of Athens before the age of Solon.  Its legendary tales  are few, its historical facts still fewer.  Cecrops, the first ruler of  Attica, is said to have divided the country into twelve districts,  which are represented as independent communities, each governed by a  separate king.  They were afterwards united into a single state, having  Athens as its capital and the seat of government.  At what time this  important union was effected cannot be determined; but it is ascribed  to Theseus, as the national hero of the Athenian people.    A few generations after Theseus, the Dorians are said to have invaded  Attica.  An oracle declared that they would be victorious if they  spared the life of the Athenian King; whereupon Codrus, who then  reigned at Athens, resolved to sacrifice himself for the welfare of his  country.  Accordingly he went into the invaders' camp in disguise,  provoked a quarrel with one of the Dorian soldiers and was killed by  the latter.  Upon learning the death of the Athenian king, the Dorians  retired from Attica without striking a blow:  and the Athenians, from  respect to the memory of Codrus, abolished the title of king, and  substituted for it that of Archon or Ruler.  The office, however, was  held for life, and was confined to the family of Codrus.  His son Medon  was the first archon, and he was followed in the dignity by eleven  members of the family in succession.  But soon after the accession  Alcmaeon, the thirteenth in descent from Medon, another change was  introduced, and the duration of the archonship was limited to ten years  (B.C. 752).  The dignity was still confined to the descendants of  Medon; but in the time of Hippomenes (B.C. 714) this restriction was  removed, and the office was thrown open to all the nobles in the state.  In B.C. 683 a still more important change took place.  The archonship  was now made annual, and its duties were distributed among nine  persons, all of whom bore the title.  The last of the decennial archons  was Eryxias, the first of the nine annual archons Creon.    Such is the legendary account of the change of government at Athens,  from royalty to an oligarchy.  It appears to have taken place peaceably  and gradually, as in most other Greek states. The whole political power  was vested in the nobles; from them the nine annual archons were taken,  and to them alone these magistrates were responsible.  The people, or  general body of freemen, had no share in the government.    The Athenian nobles were called EUPATRIDAE, the two other classes in  the state being the GEOMORI or husbandmen, and DEMIURGI or artisans.  This arrangement is ascribed to Theseus; but there was another division  of the people of still greater antiquity.  As the Dorians were divided  into three tribes, so the Ionians were usually distributed into four  tribes.  The latter division also existed among the Athenians, who were  Ionians, and it continued in full vigour down to the great revolution  of Clisthenes (B.C. 509).  These tribes were distinguished by the names  of GELEONTES (or TELEONTES) \"cultivators,\" HOPLETES \"warriors,\"  AEGICORES \"goat-herds,\" and ARGADES \"artisans.\"  Each tribe contained  three Phratriae, each Phratry thirty Gentes, and each Gens thirty heads  of families.    The first date in Athenian history on which certain reliance can be  placed is the institution of annual archons, in the year 683 B.C.  The  duties of the government were distributed among the nine archons in the  following manner.  The first was called THE ARCHON by way of  pre-eminence, and sometimes the Archon Eponymus, because the year was  distinguished by his name.  The second archon was called THE BASILEUS  or THE KING, because he represented the king in his capacity as  high-priest of the nation.  The third archon bore the title of THE  POLEMARCH, or Commander-in-chief and was, down to the time of  Clisthenes, the commander of the troops.  The remaining six had the  common title of THESMOTHETAE, or Legislators.  Their duties seem to  have been almost exclusively judicial.    The government of the Eupatrids was oppressive; and the discontent of  the people at length became so serious, that Draco was appointed in 624  B.C. to draw up a written code of laws. They were marked by extreme  severity.  He affixed the penalty of death to all crimes alike; to  petty thefts, for instance, as well as to sacrilege and murder.  Hence  they were said to have been written not in ink but in blood; and we are  told that he justified this extreme harshness by saying that small  offences deserved death, and that he knew no severer punishment for  great ones.    The legislation of Draco failed to calm the prevailing discontent.  The  people gained nothing by the written code, except a more perfect  knowledge of its severity; and civil dissensions prevailed as  extensively as before.  The general dissatisfaction with the government  was favourable to revolutionary projects; and accordingly, twelve years  after Draco's legislation (B.C. 612), Cylon, one of the nobles,  conceived the design of depriving his brother Eupatrids of their power,  and making himself tyrant of Athens.  Having collected a considerable  force, he seized the Acropolis; but he did not meet with support from  the great mass of the people, and he soon found himself closely  blockaded by the forces of the Eupatrids.  Cylon and his brother made  their escape, but the remainder of his associates, hard pressed by  hunger, abandoned the defence of the walls, and took refuge at the  altar of Athena (Minerva).  They were induced by the archon Megacles,  one of the illustrious family of the Alcmaeonidae, to quit the altar on  the promise that their lives should be spared; but directly they had  left the temple they were put to death, and some of them were murdered  even at the altar of the Eumenides or Furies.    The conspiracy thus failed; but its suppression was attended with a  long train of melancholy consequences.  The whole family of the  Alcmaeonidae was believed to have become tainted by the daring act of  sacrilege committed by Megacles; and the friends and partisans of the  murdered conspirators were not slow in demanding vengeance upon the  accursed race.  Thus a new element of discord was introduced into the  state, In the midst of these dissensions there was one man who enjoyed  a distinguished reputation at Athens, and to whom his fellow citizens  looked up as the only person in the state who could deliver them from  their political and social dissensions, and secure them from such  misfortunes for the future.  This man was Solon, the son of  Execestides, and a descendant of Codrus.  He had travelled through many  parts of Greece and Asia, and had formed acquaintance with many of the  most eminent men of his time.  On his return to his native country he  distinguished himself by recovering the island of Salamis, which had  revolted to Megara (B.C. 600).  Three years afterwards he persuaded the  Alcmaeonidae to submit their case to the judgment of three hundred  Eupatridae, by whom they were adjudged guilty of sacrilege, and were  expelled from Attica.  The banishment of the guilty race did not,  however, deliver the Athenians from their religious fears.  A  pestilential disease with which they were visited was regarded as an  unerring sign of the divine wrath.  Upon the advice of the Delphic  oracle, they invited the celebrated Cretan prophet and sage,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20967"],[0,"A Guide to Peterborough Cathedral (#7)"],[1,"ieces.    \"Then the souldiers entered the quire, and their first business was to  tear in pieces all the common prayer books that could be found. The  great bible indeed, that lay upon a brass eagle for reading the  lessons, had the good hap to escape with the loss only of the  apocrypha.    \"Next they break down all the seats, stalls and wainscots that was  behind them, being adorned with several historical passages out of the  old testament, a latin distich being in each seat to declare the story.  Whilst they were thus employed, they happened to find a great parchment  book, behind the ceiling, with some twenty pieces of gold laid there,  by a person a little before.--This encourages the souldiers in their  work, and makes them the more eager in breaking down all the rest of  the wainscot. The book was called 'Swapham,' and was afterwards  redeemed by a person belonging to the minster for ten shillings.[19]    \"There was also a great brass candlestick hanging in the middle of the  quire, containing a dozen and a half of lights, with another bow  candlestick about the brass eagle. These both were broke in pieces, and  most of the brass carried away and sold.    \"A well disposed person standing by and seeing the souldiers make such  spoil speaks to an officer, desiring him to restrain them; who  answered, '_See how these poor people are concerned to see their  idols pulled down_.'    \"When they had thus defaced and spoiled the quire, they made up next to  the east end of the church, and there break and cut in pieces, and  afterwards burn the rails that were about the communion table. The  table itself was thrown down, the table cloth taken away, with two fair  books in velvet covers; the one a bible, the other a common prayer  book, with a silver basin gilt, and a pair of silver candlesticks  beside. But upon request made to Colonel Hubbert, the books, bason, and  all else, save the candlesticks, were restored again.    \"Not long after, on the 13th day of July, 1643, Captain Barton and  Captain Hope, two martial ministers of Nottingham or Darbyshire, coming  to Peterburgh, break open the vestry, and take away a fair crimson  satten table cloth, and several other things, that had escaped the  former souldiers hands.    \"Now behind the communion table there stood a curious piece of  stone-work, admired much by strangers and travellers: a stately skreen  it was, well wrought, painted and gilt, which rose up as high almost as  the roof of the church, in a row of three lofty spires, with other  lesser spires growing out of each of them. This now had no imagery work  upon it, or any thing else that might justly give offence, and yet  because it bore the name of the high altar,[20] was pulled all down with  ropes, lay'd low and level with the ground.    \"Over this place, in the roof of the church, in a large oval yet to be  seen, was the picture of Our Saviour seated on a throne; one hand  erect, and holding a globe in the other, attended with the four  evangelists, and saints on each side, with crowns in their hands,  intended, I suppose, for a representation of Our Saviour's coming to  judgment. Some of the company espying this, cry out and say, 'Lo, this  is the God these people bow and cringe unto; this is the idol they  worship and adore.' Hereupon several souldiers charged their muskets,  (amongst whom one Daniel Wood, of Captain Roper's company was the  chief) and discharge them at it: and by the many shots they made, at  length do quite deface and spoil [the] picture.    \"The odiousness of this act gave occasion (I suppose) to a common fame,  very rife at that time, and whence _Mercurius Rusticus_ might have his  relation, viz.:--that divine vengeance had signally seized on some of  the principal actors; that one was struck blind upon the place; by a  rebound of his bullet; that another dyed mad a little after, neither of  which I can certainly attest. For, though I have made it my business to  enquire of this, I could never find any other judgment befal them then,  but that of a mad blind zeal, wherewith these persons were certainly  possest.    \"Then they rob and rifle the tombs, and violate the monuments of the  dead. And where should they first begin, but with those of the two  queens, who had been there interr'd: the one on the north side, the  other on the south side of the church, both near unto the altar. First  then they demolished Queen Katherin's tomb, Henry the Eighth his  repudiated wife: they break down the rails that enclosed the place, and  take away the black velvet pall which covered the herse,--overthrow the  herse itself, displaced the gravestone that lay over her body, and have  left nothing now remaining of that tomb, but only a monument of their  own shame and villany. The like they had certainly done to the Queen of  Scots, but that her herse and pall were removed with her body to  Westminster by King James the First, when he came to the crown. But  what did remain they served in like manner; that is, her royal arms and  escutcheons, which hung upon a pillar, near the place where she had  been interr'd [which] were most rudely pulled down, defaced and torn.    \"In the north isle of the church there was a stately tomb in memory of  Bishop Dove, who had been thirty years bishop of the place. He lay  there in portraicture in his episcopal robes, on a large bed under a  fair table of black marble, with a library of books about him. These  men that were such enemies to the name and office of a bishop, and much  more to his person, hack and hew the poor innocent statue in pieces,  and soon destroy'd all the tomb. So that in a short space, all that  fair and curious monument was buried in its own rubbish and ruines.    \"The like they do to two other monuments standing in that isle; the one  the tomb of Mr. Worm, the other of Dr. Angier, who had been prebendary  of that church.    \"In a place then called the new building, and since converted to a  library, there was a fair monument, which Sir Humphrey Orm (to save his  heir that charge and trouble), thought fit to erect in his own life  time, where he and his lady, his son and wife and all their children,  were lively represented in statues, under which were certain English  verses written:--        _\"Mistake not, reader, I thee crave,_      _This is an altar not a grave,_      _Where fire raked up in ashes lyes,_      _And hearts are made the sacrifice, &c._    \"Which two words, altar and sacrifice, 'tis said, did so provoke and  kindle the zealots indignation, that they resolve to make the tomb  itself a sacrifice: and with axes, poleaxes, and hammers, destroy and  break down all that curious monument, save only two pilasters still  remaining, which shew and testifie the elegancy of the rest of the  work. Thus it hapned, that the good old knight who was a constant  frequenter of Gods publick service, three times a day, outlived his own  monument, and lived to see himself carried in effigie on a souldiers  back, to the publick market-place, there to be sported withall, a crew  of souldiers going before in procession, some with surplices, some with  organ pipes, to make up the solemnity.    \"When they had thus demolished the chief monuments, at length the very  gravestones and marbles on the floor did not escape their sacrilegious  hands. For where there was any thing on them of sculptures or  inscriptions in brass, these they force and tear off. So that whereas  there were many fair pieces of this kind before, as that of abbot  William of Ramsey, whose large marble gravestone was plated over with  brass, and several others the like, there is not any such now in all  the church to be seen; though most of the inscriptions that were upon  them are preserved in this book.    \"One thing, indeed, I must needs clear the souldiers of, which  _Mercurius Rusticus_ upon misinformation charges them with, viz.:--That  they took away the bell clappers and sold them, with the brass they  plucked off from the tombs. The mistake was this: the neighbourhood  being continually disturbed with the souldiers jangling and ringing the  bells auker, as though there had been a scare-fire, (though there was  no other, but what they themselves had made,) some of the inhabitants  by night took away the clappers and hid them in the roof of the church,  on purpose only to free their ears from that confused noise; which gave  occasion to such as did not know it, to think the souldiers had stolen  them away.    \"Having thus done their work on the floor below, they are now at  leasure to look up to the windows above, which would have entertained  any persons else with great delight and satisfaction, but only such  zealots as these, whose eyes were so dazzled, that they thought they  saw popery in every picture and piece of painted glass.    \"Now the windows of this church were very fair, and had much curiosity  of workmanship in them, being adorned and beautified with several  historical passages out of scripture, and ecclesiastical story; such  were those in the body of the church, in the isles, in the new  building, and elsewhere. But the cloister windows were most famed of  all for their great art and pleasing variety. One side of the  quadrangle containing the history of the Old Testament; another, that  of the new; a third, a history from the first foundation of the  Monastery of King Peada to the restoring of it by King Edgar; a fourth,  all the kings of England downwards from the first Saxon king. All which  notwithstanding were most shamefully broken and destroyed.\"    [But little remains to be seen of these famous cloisters beyond the  mouldings of arches imposed in rough walls on each side. The five  recesses in the south wall were partly the lavatories used by the Monks  before entering the refectory by the richly cut door in the corner.]    _\"Every window had at the bottom the explanation of the history thus  in verse:_--        _First Window._        COL. 1.
