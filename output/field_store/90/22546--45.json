[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],[0,"The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#7)"],[1,"you to work in chains in the quarries with the  other slaves.--Go, let your Sovereign know my intention as speedily as  may be.\"    Lest the reader should be surprised to hear of any consul being thus  cavalierly treated, it may be well to explain that the barbarians, who  were thus unworthily honoured in being recognised by the European powers  at all, were grossly ignorant of the usages of civilised nations, and of  the sacred character in which the persons and families of consuls are  held.  The Deys of Algiers were constantly in the habit of threatening  the consuls themselves with flagellation and death, in order to obtain  what they desired from their respective governments, and sometimes even  carried their threats into execution--as an instance of which we may  cite the well-authenticated fact that when the French Admiral Duquesne  bombarded Algiers, the consul and twenty-two other Frenchmen were sent  out to the fleet in small pieces--blown from the mouths of cannon!  True, this was in the year 1683, but up to the very end of their bloody  and ferocious domination, the Deys maintained their character for  ignorance and barbarity--evidence of which shall be given in the sequel  of our tale.    When Don Pedro had been thus ignominiously dismissed, Sidi Hassan was  sent for by the Dey.  This man was one of the most turbulent characters  in the city, and the Dey thought it his wisest policy to secure his  friendship if possible by mingling kindness with severity.  In the event  of this course failing, he comforted himself with the reflection that it  would not be difficult to get rid of him by the simple, and too  frequently used, process of strangulation.  The knowledge that Hassan  was a favourite among the Turkish troops prevented his at once adopting  the latter method.    He was all urbanity and smiles, therefore, when the pirate captain  obeyed his summons.  He thanked him for the two pretty slave-girls he  had brought in, commended him for his success in taking prizes, and  added that he had appointed him to fill the office of attendant  janissary upon the British consul.    Up to this point Sidi Hassan had listened with satisfaction, but the  appointment just offered seemed to him so contemptible that he had  difficulty in dissembling his feelings.  The knowledge, however, that  his despotic master held his life in his hand, induced him to bow and  smile, as if with gratitude.    \"And now,\" said the Dey, \"I have a commission for you.  Go to the  British consul, tell him of your appointment, and present him with my  compliments and with the eldest slave-girl and her infant as a gift from  me.  Paulina is her name, is it not?\"    \"Yes, your highness--Paulina Ruffini, and the sister's name is Angela  Diego.\"    \"Good.  Angela you may keep to yourself,\" continued the Dey, as coolly  as if he had been talking of a silver snuff-box.    Hassan again bowed and smiled, and again had to constrain his  countenance to express gratification, though he was not a little  disgusted with Achmet's indifference to the captive girls.    Leaving the palace in a state of high indignation, he resolved to sell  Angela in the public market, although by so doing he could not hope to  gain so much as would have been the case were he to have disposed of her  by private bargain.  Thus, with strange perversity, does an angry man  often stand in the way of his own interests.    We need scarcely say that, when their fate was announced to the unhappy  sisters, they were plunged into a state of wild grief, clung to each  other's necks, and refused to be separated.    Little did Sidi Hassan care for their grief.  He tore them asunder,  locked Paulina up with her infant, and led the weeping Angela to the  slave-market, which was in the immediate neighbourhood of one of the  largest mosques of the city.    This mosque, named Djama Djedid, still stands, under the name of the  Mosquee de la Pecherie, one of the most conspicuous and picturesque  buildings in Algiers.  It was built in the seventeenth century by a  Genoese architect, a slave, who, unfortunately for himself built it in  the form of a cross, for which he was put to death by the reigning Dey.  In front of the northern door of this mosque the narrow streets of the  city gave place to a square, in which was held the market for Christian  slaves.    Here might be seen natives of almost every country--men and women and  children of all ages and complexions, civilised and uncivilised, gentle  and simple--exposed for sale; while turbaned Turks, Moors in broad-cloth  burnouses and gay vestments, Jews in dark costume, Arabs from the  desert, and men of nondescript garments and character, moved about,  criticising, examining, buying, and selling.    Just as Sidi Hassan reached the market, a gang of Christian slaves were  halted near the door of the mosque.  It was evening.  They had been  toiling all day at the stone-quarries in the mountains, and were now on  their way, weary, ragged, and foot-sore, to the Bagnio, or prison, in  which were housed the public slaves--those not sold to private  individuals, but retained by government and set to labour on the public  works.    A few of these slaves wore ponderous chains as a punishment for having  been unruly--the others were unshackled.  Among them stood our  unfortunate friends Francisco Rimini and his sons Lucien and Mariano--  but ah! how changed!  Only two days had elapsed since their arrival, yet  their nearest friends might have failed to recognise them, so  dishevelled were they, and their faces so covered with dust and  perspiration.  For their own garments had been substituted ragged shirts  and loose Turkish drawers reaching to below the knee.  Old straw hats  covered their heads, but their lower limbs and feet were naked; where  not stained by blood and dust, the fairness of their skins showed how  little they had been used to such exposure.  Lucien's countenance wore  an expression of hopeless despair; that of his father, which was wont to  look so bluff and hearty, now betrayed feelings of the tenderest pity,  as if he had forgotten his own sufferings in those of his children.  Mariano, on the contrary, looked so stubborn and wicked that no one  could have believed it possible he had ever been a gay, kindly,  light-hearted youth!  Poor fellow! his high spirit had been severely  tried that day, but evidently not tamed, though the blood on the back of  his shirt showed that his drivers had made vigorous attempts to subdue  him.  During the heat of the day Lucien had grown faint from toil and  hunger, and had received a cruel lash from one of their guardians.  This  had roused Mariano.  He had sprung to avenge the blow, had been seized  by three powerful men, lashed until he became insensible, and, on  recovering, had been forced to continue his toil of carrying stones  until not only all the strength, but apparently all the spirit, was  taken out of him.    From this condition he was reviving slightly when he reached the  market-place, and, as his strength returned, the firm pressure of his  lips and contraction of his brows increased.    The slave-drivers were not slow to observe this, and two of them took  the precaution to stand near him.  It was at this critical moment that  the poor youth suddenly beheld Angela Diego led into the market--more  interesting and beautiful than ever in her sorrow--to be sold as a  slave.    Mariano had been deeply touched by the sorrow and sad fate of the  sisters when he first saw them on board the pirate-vessel.  At this  sight of the younger sister, prudence, which had retained but a slight  hold of him during the day, lost command altogether.  In a burst of  uncontrollable indignation he sent one of his guards crashing through  the open doorway of the mosque, drove the other against the corner of a  neighbouring house, rushed towards Sidi Hassan, and delivered on the  bridge of that hero's nose a blow that instantly laid him flat on the  ground.  At the same moment he was seized by a dozen guards, thrown  down, bound, and carried off to the whipping-house, where he was  bastinadoed until he felt as if bones and flesh, were one mass of  tingling jelly.  In this state, almost incapable of standing or walking,  he was carried to the Bagnio, and thrown in among the other prisoners.    While Mariano was being conveyed away, Sidi Hassan arose in a  half-stupefied condition from the ground.  Fortunately he was ignorant  of who had knocked him down, and why he had been so treated, or he might  have vented his wrath on poor Angela.    Just at that moment he was accosted by Bacri the Jew--a convenient butt  on whom to relieve himself; for the despised Israelites were treated  with greater indignity in Algiers at that time than perhaps in any other  part of the earth.    \"Dog,\" said he fiercely, \"hast thou not business enough of thine own in  fleecing men, that thou shouldst interfere with me?\"    \"Dog though I may be,\" returned Bacri, with gravity, but without a touch  of injured feeling, \"I do not forget that I promised you four thousand  dollars to spare the Christians, and it is that which induces me to  intrude on you now.\"    \"Humph!\" ejaculated Hassan, somewhat mollified; \"I verily believe that  thou hast some interested and selfish motive at the bottom.  However,  that business is thine, not mine.\"    \"Whether my motive be interested or not you are well able to judge,\"  returned Bacri gently, \"for the slaves are poor and helpless; they are  also Christians, and you know well that the Jews have no love for the  Christians; in which respect it seems to me that they bear some  resemblance to the men of other creeds.\"    Sidi Hassan felt that there was an intended sarcasm in the last remark,  but the thought of the dollars induced him to waive further discussion.    \"Do you wish to sell the girl?\" said Bacri in a casual way, as though it  had just occurred to him.    \"Ay, but I must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21699"],[0,"The Rover of the Andes: A Tale of Adventure on South America (#7)"],[1,"r's wrong an' de oder  say de one's say not right.  Bof say das a big lie so at it dey goes  hammer an' tongs to prove--ha! ha! to prove dey's bof right.  Oh my!\"    Here the negro opened his cavernous jaws and gave vent to another  explosion of shrill laughter.    \"What fools dey is!\"    \"Then you think it is only fools who fight, Quashy?\"    \"Ob coorse, massa.  Don' you see, if dey wasn't fools dey wouldn't  fight; 'cause fightin' can't prove nuffin', an' it can't do nuffin',  'cep' waste life an' money.  No doubt,\" added the negro, with a  meditative gaze at the ground, \"when rubbers come at a feller he's boun'  to fight, for why? he can't help it; or when Red Injin savages--\"    \"Have a care, Quashy, what you say about Indians.  I've warned you once  already.\"    \"O massa!\" said the poor black, with a look of almost superhuman  penitence, \"I beg your pard'n.  I's quite forgit to remimber.  I was  just agwine to say that there _is_ times when you _mus'_ fight.  But  isn't Chili Christ'n, an' isn't P'roo Christ'n?  I don' bleeve in  Christ'ns what cut each oder's t'roats to prove dey's right.  Howsever,  das noting.  What I's agwine to say is--dars a lot o' white livers on  bof sides, an' dese dey runs away, takes to de mountains and becomes  rubbers.  But dey's not all bad alike, dough none of em's good.  You's  heer'd ob Conrad ob de Mountains, massa?\"    \"Yes, Pedro mentioned his name.  He seems to be a celebrated bandit.\"    \"Well, I's not sure.  Some peepil say he's not a rubber at all, but a  good sort o' feller as goes mad sometimes.  He's bery kind to women an'  child'n, but he's bery awrful.\"    \"That's a strange character.  How do you know he's so very awful,  Quashy?\"    \"Because I seed 'im, massa.\"    \"Indeed, where?\"    \"On de plains ob Proo, massa,\" replied the negro, with that  self-satisfied clearing of the throat which was usually the prelude to a  long story.    \"Come now, Quashy,\" said Lawrence, with a laugh, \"don't be too  long-winded, and don't exaggerate.\"    \"Don't ex-what-gerate, massa?\"    \"Exaggerate.\"    \"What's dat, massa?\"    \"Never mind, Quashy--go on.\"    With a genial and highly exaggerated smile, the negro proceeded:--    \"Well, as I was agwine to say, I see dis man, Conrad ob de Mountains, on  de plains ob Proo.  I's in de Proo camp at de time, attendin' on you's  fadder, an' de army ob Chili was in front ob us on de slopes ob de  hills, agwine to go in for a fight wid us.  De sojers of Proo wasn't  bery keen for fightin'.  I could see dat, but their gin'ral screwed 'em  up to de pint, an' dey was all ready, when all of a sudden, we sees a  pris'ner brought in by four sojers.  Dey seem so 'fraid ob him dey  darn't touch him, tho' he was unarmed.  Two walked behind him, an' two  walked in front ob 'im, all wid dere baynets pintin' at 'im, ready to  skewer 'im all round if he was try to run.  But, poor chap, he walk wid  his head down, bery sad-like--nebber t'inkin' ob runnin'.  So dey druv'  'im up to our gin'ral.  I was in a crowd o' tall fellers, an' de  pris'ner had his back to me, so I not seed his face well.  `Das Conrad  ob de Mountains dey've cotched,' says a feller near me.  `Listen!'  We  all listen'd so quiet you could hear a 'skito sneeze.  `What's you'  name?' asks de gin'ral, ridin' close up to Conrad on his splendid  war-hoss--a child ob one ob de war-hosses as come ober wid Pizarro from  Spain.  `My name's Pumpkin,' answers de pris'ner.  `Das a lie!' says de  gin'ral.  `No's not,' says Conrad, lookin' up, as I could see by de back  ob his head.  `What side you b'longs to, raskil?'  `To no side,  gin'ral.'  `Whar you come fro'?'  `Fro' de mountains, gin'r'l.'  `Whar  you go to?'  `Ober de mountains, gin'ral.'  I could see by de way de  fedders in de gin'ral's hat shake dat he's gittin' in a wax at de cool  imprence ob de pris'ner, but he 'strain hisself, an' spoke sarkmustic.  `Senhor Pumpkin,' says he, `you are Conrad ob de Mountains,'--('cause he  guess who he was by dat time); `how you prepose to go ober de  mountains?'  `Dis way!' says Conrad, an', nixt momint, up goes de  gin'ral's leg, down goes his head an' fedders on de ground, and Conrad  sits in de saddle afore you can wink.  All round de baynets was charge,  but dey haul up jist in time not to skewer one anoder, for de horse  shotted out fro' between dem all, an' away straight to de Chili lines,  whar dere was a great cheerin', for dey t'ought it was a deserter.  When  Conrad came up, he trotted quietly troo de ranks, till he got near to  whar de Chili commander stood wid his hofficers, wonderin' who he was.  As he couldn't 'spec' to git no furder, he rides quietly up to a  hofficer, takes de sword out ob his hand afore he understand what he  wants, den, diggin' de spurs into de big war-hoss, off he goes wid a  yell like a Red Inj--oh!  I's mean like a--a buff'lo bull.  Out comes de  swords.  Dey close all round 'im.  I no see him by dat time.  He too fur  off; but a friend ob mine was near, an' he say dat Conrad swing de long  sword so quick, an' de sun was shinin' so clar, dat it look like a  circle ob fire all round him.  Down dey hoed on ebery side.  Off goed a  head here, an arm dere.  One trooper cut troo at de waist, an' fall'd  off, but de legs stick on.  Anoder splitted right down fro' de helmet,  so as one half fall on one side, an' de odour half fall--\"    \"Come now, Quashy,\" interrupted Lawrence, with a laugh, \"you  exaggerate.\"    \"What! you call _dat_ exaggerate, massa?  Den Conrad exaggerate about  ten more afore he cut his way troo an' 'scaped to de hills.  Oh, he's an  awrful man!\"    \"Truly he must be very awful, if all you relate of him be true,\" said  Lawrence; \"and I sincerely trust that if we fall in with him we may find  him friendly.  Now, I shall ride forward, and ask Pedro if we are far  from our halting-place.\"    This abrupt change of subject was usually understood by the amiable  negro to mean that our hero--whom he persisted in regarding as his  master--had had enough of his conversation at that time, so he reined  back his mule, while Lawrence pushed forward.    To his question Pedro replied that he expected to reach the next  sleeping-place very soon.    \"It will not be as luxurious as the last,\" he said; \"but, doubtless, one  who has traversed the mountains of Scotland is prepared to rough it in  South America.\"    \"You speak as if you were yourself somewhat acquainted with the Scottish  mountains.\"    \"So I am, senhor,\" replied the guide.  \"I had clambered up Ben Nevis  while I was yet a little boy.\"    \"Surely you are not a Scot?\" said Lawrence, with a quick glance.    \"No, I am not a Scot, senhor.  To have travelled in a country does not  render one a native, else might I claim England, Ireland, and  Switzerland as my native lands.  See, yonder lies the little farm where  I hope to put up for the night.\"    He pointed as he spoke to the head of the glen or valley, which was  somewhat narrower and more gloomy than the vales through which they had  ridden in the earlier part of the day.  Since crossing the first  cordillera on the Pacific side of the Andes they had, indeed, traversed  a great variety of country.  In some places the land was rocky and  comparatively barren.  In others, where the peculiar form of the  mountains sheltered the table-lands, the country was fertile, and  numerous farms dotted the landscape, but as they ascended higher on the  main chain the farms became fewer, until they finally disappeared, and  an occasional hut, with a mere patch of cultivated ground, was all that  remained in the vast solitudes to tell of the presence of man.    It was to one of these huts that Pedro now directed his companion's  attention.    \"A most suitable place for the abode of banditti,\" remarked Lawrence, as  they advanced up the winding path.    \"And many a time do the bandits lodge there,\" returned Pedro.  \"Of  course, robbers of the Andes do not go about with placards on their  backs announcing their profession to all the world, and, as long as they  behave themselves, farmers are bound to regard them as honest men.\"    \"You said, if I heard rightly,\" observed Lawrence, \"that you had  formerly met with the rascal whom we let off the other day.\"    \"Yes, I know him well.  One of the worst men in the land.  I'm almost  sorry we did not shoot him, but I never could take human life in cold  blood, even when that life had been forfeited over and over again.  However, he's sure to get his deserts sooner or later.\"    \"Then he is not Conrad of the Mountains whom you mentioned to me  lately?\"    \"No, Conrad is a very different stamp of man--though he has not too much  to boast of in the way of character if all that's said of him be true.  The man we let go is a gaucho of the Pampas named Cruz.  He delights in  war, and has fought in the armies of Chili, Peru, and the Argentine  Confederation without much regard to the cause of quarrel.  In fact,  wherever fighting is going on Cruz is sure to be there.  Lately he has  taken to the mountains, and now fights for his own hand.\"    \"And the other poor fellow who went over the precipice,\" asked Lawrence,  \"did you know him?\"    \"I knew him slightly.  Antonio is his name, I think, but he is a villain  of no note--an inferior bandit, though quite equal to his captain, no  doubt, in selfishness and cruelty.\"    On arriving at the hut or small farm at the head of the valley, they  found its owner, a burly, good-humoured Creole, alone with his mother,  an old woman whose shrivelled-up appearance suggested the idea of a  mummy partially thawed into life.  She was busy cooking over a small  fire, the smoke of which seemed congenial to her--judging from the  frequency with which she thrust her old head into it while inspecting  the contents of an iron pot.    There was plenty of room for them, the host said, with an air of  profound respect for Pedro, whom he saluted as an old acquaintance.  The  house had been full two days"]]]
