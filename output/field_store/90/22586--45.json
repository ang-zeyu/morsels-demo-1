I thought him a trifle visionary, but charming all the same, and  well-mannered; besides he had some fortune, and I thought that once  married poetizing would not prevent him from seeking out some good  appointment which would set us quite at ease.    [Illustration: p089-100]    [Illustration: p090-101]    He, too at that time seemed to find me to his taste. When he came to see  me at my aunt's in the country, he could not find words enough to admire  the order and arrangement of our little house, kept like a convent, \"It  is so quaint!\" he used to say. He would laugh and call me all sorts of  names taken from the poems and romances he had read. That shocked me a  little I confess; I should have liked him to be more serious. But it  was not until we were married and settled in Paris, that I felt all the  difference of our two natures.    I had dreamed of a little home kept scrupulously bright and clean;  instead of which, he began at once to encumber our apartment with  useless old-fashioned furniture, covered with dust, and with faded  tapestries, old as the hills. In everything it was the same. Would you  believe that he obliged me to put away in the attic a sweetly  pretty Empire clock, which had come to me from my aunt, and some  splendidly-framed pictures given me by my school friends. He thought  them hideous. I am still wondering why? For after all, his study was one  mass of lumber, of old smoky pictures; statuettes I blushed to look at,  chipped antiquities of all kinds, good for nothing; vases that would not  hold water, odd cups, chandeliers covered with verdigris.    [Illustration: p094-105]    By the side of my beautiful rosewood piano, he had put another, a little  shabby thing with all the polish off, half-the notes wanting, and so  old and worn that one could hardly hear it. I began to think: \"Good  gracious! is an artist then, really a little mad? Does he only care for  useless things, and despise all that is useful?\"    When I saw his friends', the society he received, it was still worse.  Men with long hair, great beards, scarcely combed, badly dressed, who  did not hesitate to smoke in my presence, while to listen to them made  me quite uncomfortable, so widely opposed were their ideas to mine. They  used long words, fine phrases, nothing natural, nothing simple. Then  with all this, not a notion of ordinary civilities: you might ask them  to dinner twenty times running, and there would be never a call, never  a return of any kind. Not even a card or a bonbon on New Year's day.  Nothing. Some of these gentry were married and brought their wives to  see us. You should have seen the style of these persons! For every day  wear, superb toilettes such as thank heaven, I would wear at no time!  And so ill-arranged, without order or method. Hair loose, skirts  trailing, and such a bold display of their talents! There were some who  sang like actresses, played the piano like professors, all talked on  every subject just like men. I ask you, is this reasonable?    Ought serious women once married to think of anything but the care of  their household? This is what I tried to make my husband understand,  when he was vexed at seeing me give up my music. Music is all very well  when one is a little girl and has nothing better to do. But candidly,  I should consider myself very ridiculous if I sat down every day to the  piano.    [Illustration: p098-109]    Oh! I am quite aware that his great complaint against me is that I  wished to draw him from the strange society I considered so dangerous  for him. \"You have driven away all my friends?\" he often used to say  reproachfully. Yes, I did do so, and I don't regret it. Those creatures  would have ended by driving him crazy. After leaving them, he would  often spend the night in making rhymes and in marching up and down and  talking aloud. As if he were not already sufficiently eccentric and  original in himself without being excited by others! What caprices, what  whims have I not put up with! Suddenly one morning, he would appear in  my room: \"Quick, get your hat--we are off to the country.\" Then one  must leave everything, sewing, household affairs, take a carriage, go  by rail, spend a mint of money! And I, who only thought of economy! For  after all, it is not with fifteen thousand francs (six hundred pounds)  a year that one can be counted rich in Paris or make any provision for  one's children. At first he used to laugh at my observations, and try  to make me laugh; then when he saw how firmly I was resolved to remain  serious, he found fault with my simplicity and my taste for home. Am  I to blame because I detest theatres and concerts, and those artistic  soirees to which he wished to drag me, and where he met his old  acquaintances, a lot of scatterbrains, dissipated and Bohemian?    At one time, I thought he was becoming more reasonable. I had managed to  with-draw him from his good-for-nothing circle of friends, and to gather  round us a society of sensible people, well-settled in life, who might  be of use to us. But no! Monsieur was bored. He was always bored,  from morning till night. At our little soirees, where I was careful to  arrange a whist table and a tea table, all as it should be, he would  appear with such a face! in such a temper! When we were alone, it was  just the same. Nevertheless, I was full of little attentions. I used to  say to him: \"Read me something of what you are doing.\" He recited to me  verses, tirades, of which I understood nothing, but I put on an air of  interest, and here and there made some little remark, which by the way,  inevitably had the knack of annoying him. In a year, working night and  day, he could only make of all his rhymes, one single volume which never  sold, I said to him: \"Ah! you see,\" just in a reasoning spirit, to bring  him to something more comprehensible, more remunerative, He got into a  frightful rage, and afterwards sank into a state of gloomy depression  which made me very unhappy. My friends advised me as well as they could:  \"You see, my dear, it is the ennui and bad temper of an unoccupied man.  If he worked a little more, he would not be so gloomy.\"    Then I set to work, and all my belongings too, to seek him an  appointment, I moved heaven and earth, I made I don't know how many  visits to the wives of government officials, heads of departments; I  even penetrated into a minister's office. It was a surprise I reserved  for him, I said to my-self: \"We shall see whether he will be pleased  this time,\" At length, the day when I received his nomination in a  lovely envelope with five big seals, I carried it myself to his table,  half wild with joy. It was provision for the future, comfort, self  content, the tranquillity of regular work. Do you know what he did? He  said: \"He would never forgive me.\" After which he tore the minister's  letter into a thousand pieces, and rushed out, banging the doors. Oh!  these artists, poor unsettled brains taking life all the wrong way! What  could be done with such a man? I should have liked to talk to him, to  reason with him. In vain. Those were indeed right, who had said to me:  \"He is a madman.\" Of what use moreover to talk to him? We do not  speak the same language. He would not understand me, any more than I  understand him. And now, here we must sit and look at each other. I see  hatred in his glance, and yet I have true affection for him. It is very  painful.         *   *   *   *   *      A MISUNDERSTANDING -- THE HUSBAND'S VERSION.    I had thought of everything, taken all my precautions. I would not have  a Parisian, because Parisian women alarm me. I would not have a rich  wife because she might be too exacting and extravagant. I also  dreaded family ties, that terrible network of homely affections, which  monopolizes, imprisons, dwarfs and stifles. My wife was the realization  of my fondest dreams. I said to myself: \"She will owe me everything.\"    [Illustration: p091-102]    What pleasure to educate this simple mind to the contemplation of  beauty, to initiate this pure soul to my enthusiasms and hopes, to give  life, in short, to this statue! The fact is she had the air of a  statue, with her great serious calm eyes, her regular Greek profile, her  features, which although rather too marked and severe, were softened by  the rose-tinted bloom of youth and the shadow of the waving hair. Added  to all this was a faint provincial accent that was my especial joy, an  accent to which with closed eyes, I listened as a recollection of happy  childhood, the echo of a tranquil life in some far away, utterly unknown  nook. And to think that now, this accent has become unbearable to me!  But in those days, I had faith. I loved, I was happy, and disposed to  be still more so. Full of ardour for my work, I had as soon as I was  married begun a new poem, and in the evening I read to her the verses  of the day. I wished to make her enter completely into my existence. The  first time or two, she said to me: \"Very pretty,\" and I was grateful  to her for this childish approbation, hoping that in time she would  comprehend better what was the very breath of my life.    Poor creature! How I must have bored her! After having read her my  verses, I explained them to her, seeking in her beautiful astonished  eyes the hoped-for gleam of light, ever fancying I should surprise it.    [Illustration: p095-106]    I obliged her to give me her opinion and I passed over all that was  foolish to retain only what a chance inspiration might contain of good.  I so longed to make of her my true help mate, the real artist's wife!  But no! She could not understand. In vain did I read to her the great  poets, choosing the strongest, the tenderest,--the golden rhymes of the  love poems fell upon her ear as coldly and tediously as a hailstorm.

But  the eight others who were wounded, two of them mortally, owed their  unfortunate condition to the altogether unnecessary and ill-advised  attempt by Col. Sutherland to shell the bridge which was being held by  his own troops. He had the panicky idea that the Red Guards were coming  or going to come across that bridge and ordered the shrapnel which cut  up the platoon of \"M\" Company with its hail of lead instead of the Reds  who had halted 700 yards away and themselves were shelling the bridge  but to no effect. Not only that but when Col. Sutherland was informed  that his artillery was getting his own troops, he first asked on one  telephone for another quart of whisky and later called up his artillery  officer and ordered the deadly fire to lengthen range. This was observed  by an American soldier, Ernest Roleau, at Verst 466, who acted as  interpreter and orderly in Sutherland's headquarters that day.    The British officer sadly retired to his Blue Car headquarters at Verst  466, thinking the Reds would surely recapture the bridge. But Major  Nichols in command at field headquarters at Verst 461 thought  differently. When the order came over the wire for him to withdraw his  Americans from the bridge, this infantry reserve officer whose  previously most desperate battle, outside of a melee between the Bulls  and Bears on Wall Street, had been to mashie nib out of a double  bunkered trap on the Detroit Country Club golf course, as usual with  him, took \"plenty of sand.\" He shoved the order to one side till he  heard from the officer at the front and then requested a countermanding  order. He made use of the veteran Alliez's counsel. And for two dubious  nights and days with \"M\" and \"I\" Companies he held on to the scant three  miles of advance which had been paid for so dearly. And the Reds never  did get back the important bridge.    Now it was evident that the Bolshevik rear-guard action was not to be  scared out. It was bent on regaining its ground. During these last  September days of supposed converging drive in three columns on  Plesetskaya our widely separated forces had all met with stiff  resistance and been worsted in action. The Bolshevik had earned our  respect as a fighter. More fighting units were hurried up. Our \"A\" Force  Command began careful reconnaissance and plans of advance. American  officers and doughboys had their first experiences, of the many  experiences to follow, of taking out Russian guides and from their own  observations and the crude old maps and from doubtful hearsay to piece  together a workable military sketch of the densely forested area.    Artillery actions and patrol actions were almost daily diet till, with  the advance two weeks later on October thirteenth, the offensive  movement started again. This time French and Americans closely  co-operated. The Reds evidently had some inkling of it, for on the  morning when the amalgamated \"M\"-\"Boyer\" force entered the woods, inside  fifteen minutes the long, thin column of horizon blue and olive drab was  under shrapnel fire of the Bolo. With careful march this force gained  the flank and rear of the enemy at Verst 455, and camped in a hollow  square, munched on hardtack and slept on their arms in the cold rain.  Lieut. Stoner, Capt. Boyer, the irrepressible French fun-maker, Capt.  Moore and Lieut. Giffels slept on the same patch of wet moss with the  same log for a pillow, unregardful of the TNT in the Engineer officer's  pocket, which was for use the next morning in blowing the enemy's  armored train.    At last 5:00 a. m. comes but it is still dark and foggy. Men stretch  their cold and cramped limbs after the interminable night. No smokes. No  eats. In ten minutes of whispering the columns are under way. The  leading platoon gets out of our reach. Delay while we get a new guide  lets them get on ahead of the other platoons. Too bad. It spoils the  plan. The main part of the attacking forces can not press forward fast  enough to catch up. The engineers will be too late to blow the track in  rear of the Bolo train.    The Red Guard listening posts and his big tower on the flank now stand  him in good stead. He sees the little platoon of Franco-Americans  approaching in line, and sends out a superior force to meet the attack.  Ten minutes of stiff fire fight ensues during which the other attacking  platoons strive to get up to their positions in rear and rear flank. But  our comrades are evidently out-numbered and being worsted. We must  spring our attack to save them.    Oh, those bugles! Who ever heard of a half mile charge? And such a  melee. Firing and yelling and tooting like ten thousand the main party  goes in. What would the first \"old man\" of the 339th, our beloved  Colonel John W. Craig, have said at sight of that confused swarm of  soldiers heading straight for the Bolo positions. Lucky for us the Bolo  does not hold his fire till we swarm out of the woods. As it is in his  panic he blazes away into the woods pointblank with his artillery  mounted on the trains and with his machine guns, two of which only are  on ground positions. And his excited aim is characteristically high,  Slavo Bogga. We surge in. He jumps to his troop trains, tries to cover  his withdrawal by the two machine guns, and gets away, but with hundreds  of casualties from our fire that we pour into the moving trains.  Marvellous luck, we have monkeyed with a buzz saw and suffered only  slight casualties, one American killed and four wounded. Two French  wounded.    The surprise at 455 threw \"the wind\" up the Bolo's back at his forward  positions, 457 and 457-1/2, and Lieuts. Primm and Soyer's amalgamated  French-American attacking party won a quick victory. The armored train  came on through over the precious bridge at Verst 458, the track was  repaired and our artillery came up to 455 and answered the Red armored  train that was shelling us while we consolidated the position. Lieut.  Anselmi's resolute American signal men unmindful of the straggling Bolos  who were working south in the woods along the railroad, \"ran\" the  railway telephone lines back to field headquarters at 458 and  established communications with Major Nichols.    As soon as transportation was open \"I\" Company and Apsche's company of  French moved up and went on through to battle the Reds in the same  afternoon out of their position at Verst 450 where they had rallied and  to advance on the fifteenth to a position at 448, where the Americans  dug in. Trouble with the French battalion was brewing for the British  Command. The poilus had heard of the proposed armistice on the Western  Front. \"La guerre finis,\" they declared, and refused to remain with \"I\"  Company on the line.    So on October sixteenth this company found itself single-handed holding  the advanced position against the counter-attack of the reinforced Reds.  After a severe artillery barrage of the Reds, Captain Winslow pushed  forward to meet the attack of the Bolos and fought a drawn battle with  them in the woods in the afternoon. Both sides dug in. \"I\" Company lost  one killed and four wounded.    Meanwhile \"M\" Company, after one day to reorganize and rest, hurried up  during the afternoon fight and prepared to relieve \"I\" Company. Sleeping  on their arms around the dull-burning fires at 448 between noisy periods  of night exchanges of fire by the Americans and Red Guards, this company  next morning at 6:00 a. m. went through under a rolling barrage of Major  Lee's artillery, which had been able to improve its position during the  night, thanks to the resolute work of Lieut. Giffels and his American  Engineers on the railroad track. Stoner's platoon destroyed the heavy  outpost of Bolos with a sharp fire fight and a charge and swept on, only  halting when he reached a large stream. Beyond this was a half-mile  square clearing with characteristic woodpiles and station and woodmen's  houses, occupied by a heavy force of six hundred Red Guards, themselves  preparing for attack on the Americans. Here Captain Moore timed his  three platoons and Lieut. Spitler's machine guns for a rush on three  sides with intent to gain a foothold at least within the clearing. The  very impetuosity of the doughboy's noisy attack struck panic into the  poorly led Bolsheviks and they won an easy victory, having possession of  the position inside half an hour. The Reds were routed and pursued  beyond the objectives set by Col. Sutherland. And the old company horse  shoe again worked. Though many men had their clothes riddled not a man  was scratched.    The position was consolidated. An hour after the engagement two sections  of the French Company that had sulked the preceding day came smilingly  up and helped fortify the flanks. Their beloved old battalion commander,  Major Alabernarde, had shamed them out of their mutinous conduct and  they were satisfied again to help their much admired American comrades  in this strange, faraway side show of the great world war.    One or two interesting reminiscences here crowd in. It was during the  charge on 445 that Lieut. Stoner missed a dugout door by a foot with his  hand grenade and his tender heart near froze with horror an hour  afterward when he came back from pursuit of the Reds to find that with  the one Bolo soldier in the dugout were cowering twenty-seven women and  children, one eight days old. The red-whiskered old Bolo soldier had a  hand grenade in his pocket and Sergeant Dundon nearly shook his yellow  teeth loose trying to make him reply to questions in English. And the  poor varlet nearly expired with terror later in the day when Lieut. Riis  of the American Embassy stood him up with his back against a shack.  \"Comrades, have mercy on me! My wife and my children,\" he begged as he  fell on his knees before the click of the camera."]]]
