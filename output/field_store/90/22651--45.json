How  such an irregularity had crept in amongst the uniforms of the college  Miss Cavendish could not comprehend; it must form the subject of an  after enquiry, and in the meantime, stilling with a reproachful glance  a faint whisper in her vicinity, she joined in the singing of a psalm  with her usual clear intonation. When the service was over, however,  and the girls began to file away in orderly line, she spoke a few,  rapid words to a monitress, who at once passed quickly out by a side  door.    As the extraordinary green hat made its appearance in the quadrangle it  was greeted with quite a buzz of excitement by the girls assembled  outside. Only a few of them, comparatively, knew Honor by sight, and  the rest were asking who she was, and to which house she belonged. The  common feeling was distinctly unfavourable. Apart from the unseemliness  of such an exhibition in a sacred place, new girls were not expected to  make themselves conspicuous, or to introduce innovations; either was  considered an impertinence on their part: so the general verdict was  that Honor had done a dreadful thing, and public opinion was dead  against her. She, however, held up her head as proudly as though her  absurd hat had been the latest creation from Bond Street.    \"It's a tribute to my native land!\" she said airily, in response to a  chorus of questions. \"Sorry you don't like it, but it's my first  attempt at hat-trimming, and I flattered myself it wasn't bad for a  beginner. St. Patrick for ever! I made up my mind before I started that  I'd keep up the credit of the shamrock on this side of the water, and  I've done my best. Hurrah for old Ireland!\" Then, as if her feelings  were absolutely too much for her, she took her skirt in her hands, and  began to dance an old-fashioned Kerry hornpipe, humming a lively Irish  tune to supply the music.    The girls stared in amazement at the mad performance. \"She's showing  off!\" declared some, but others laughed, and watched with a kind of  fascination, for the dance was striking and original, and the movements  were unusually graceful.    Honor's triumph, however, was short-lived. Vivian Holmes forced her way  through the crowd, and, laying her hand on the shoulder of the  obstreperous new-comer, told her to report herself at once in Miss  Cavendish's study. The lookers-on scuttled away to their classes  without being told; they were half-ashamed of having taken so much  notice of a new girl. Lettice Talbot, turning round, caught a glimpse  of Honor walking blithely away, with a jaunty smile on her face.    \"As if a visit to the head mistress meant nothing at all!\" she gasped.    \"She'll soon find out her mistake,\" replied Ruth Latimer grimly. \"Miss  Cavendish can reduce one to a quaking jelly when she feels inclined.\"    Honor was in one of her wildest, most reckless moods, and the prospect  of a passage of arms with the principal of the College was as the call  of battle to a knight of old. In her conflicts with her governesses at  home she had invariably come off best, and it pleased her to think she  had now the opportunity of trying her will in opposition to that of the  ruler of this little kingdom.    Miss Cavendish's study was a beautiful and unusual room. It was built  in accordance with an old-world design, and in shape resembled an  ancient chapter-house. The richly carved chimney-piece, the dark  panelling of the walls, and the straight-backed oak chairs helped to  carry out the prevailing note of mediaevalism, which was further  enhanced by a large, stained-glass window, filled with figures of  saints, that faced the doorway. To enter was like going into the peace  and serenity of some old cathedral, and, notwithstanding her defiant  frame of mind, a feeling of something akin to reverence crept over  Honor as she crossed the threshold. Her impressionable Celtic  temperament could not fail to be influenced by outward surroundings:  she had a great love of the beautiful, and this room satisfied her  aesthetic tastes.    [Illustration: AN INTERVIEW WITH MISS CAVENDISH]    The head mistress was standing beside the hearth, which, though devoid  of fire at this season of the year, was piled up with newly cut logs.  In her long, clinging black dress, the light from the halo of St.  Aldwyth in the window falling on her regular Greek features, and  touching with a ruddier gleam the pale gold of her rippling hair, Miss  Cavendish looked an imposing and commanding figure. Born of a good  family, the daughter of a high dignitary of the Church, she was by  nature a student, and after a brilliant career at Girton she had for a  time devoted herself to scientific research, arousing much interest by  her clever articles in various periodicals; but feeling that her true  vocation was teaching, she had turned her attention to education, and,  gaining a reputation in the scholastic world, had in course of time  been elected as the principal of Chessington College, a post which she  filled with dignity, and greatly to the satisfaction of both governors  and parents. Not a remarkably tender woman, she was perhaps more  respected than loved by her pupils; but she had great powers of  administration, and managed to impress upon her girls a strict sense of  duty and responsibility, a love of work, a fine perception of honour,  and a desire to keep up the high tone and prestige of the school.    She turned her clear, cold blue eyes on Honor, as the latter entered  the room, with a scrutinizing gaze, so comprehensive and so full of  authority that, despite her intention of showing a bold front, the girl  involuntarily quailed.    \"Come here, Honor Fitzgerald,\" began Miss Cavendish, in a calm,  measured tone. \"I wish you to explain to me why you have taken it upon  yourself to alter the costume which, you are well aware, is obligatory  for all attending the College.\"    \"I can't wear orange,\" replied Honor, plucking up her courage for the  battle; \"it's against my principles.\"    \"There are right principles and wrong principles; we will decide  presently to which class yours belong. On what grounds do you raise  your objection?\"    \"I'm Irish,\" said Honor briefly, \"so I prefer green.\"    \"That is no reason. We have many nationalities here, and do you imagine  that every girl can be permitted to carry out her individual taste?  Tell me why you suppose such a rule was framed.\"    \"I don't know,\" returned Honor rebelliously.    \"Then you must think, for I require an answer.\"    Honor stared at the fireplace, at the bookcase, with its richly bound  volumes; at the window, where the red robe of St. Hilary made such a  glorious spot of colour; at the table, covered with books and papers;  and finally her glance went back to the head mistress, whose eyes were  still fixed on her with that steady, embarrassing gaze.    \"Was it to make everybody look alike?\" she replied at last, almost as  if the words were dragged from her lips.    \"Exactly! Then, to return to my original question, why, knowing this  fact, did you presume to break the rule?\"    Honor was again silent. Somehow her intended bravery seemed to desert  her.    \"I met your father, Major Fitzgerald, yesterday,\" continued Miss  Cavendish. \"I understand that he held a command in the Royal Munster  Fusiliers, and did splendid service in the Boer War. Kindly tell me  what explanation he would have given to his general if he had appeared  at church parade minus his uniform.\"    \"Oh, but he wouldn't have done that!\" exclaimed Honor in horror.    \"Why not?\"    \"Why! because he is a soldier. How could he? The uniform is part of the  service.\"    \"And what is the first duty of a soldier?\"    \"To obey orders,\" answered Honor, with a spark of apprehension in her  eyes.    \"You are right. Now, what would happen to a regiment if each  individual, instead of obeying his superior officer, were to follow his  own inclinations?\"    \"It would go to pieces.\"    \"And what occurs when a soldier commits any breach of regulations?\"    \"He is court-martialled and punished.\"    \"Is that just?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But why?\"    \"Oh, because--because--it's the Army, and they must! There couldn't be  any discipline without.\"    \"Exactly! You are an officer's daughter, and you evidently appreciate  the vast importance of good discipline. Now, we are a little army here.  Every girl, as a member of this community, is bound to preserve its  rules, which have been wisely framed, and deserve to be faithfully  kept. You have been guilty of a very grave breach of our regulations,  and by your own showing you merit punishment. Do you consider this to  be just?\"    \"Yes,\" returned Honor, meeting the head mistress's look firmly.    \"We have an esprit de corps at the College,\" continued Miss Cavendish,  \"which makes each girl anxious to keep up the credit and prestige of  the school. When you have been here a short time, and have learnt the  tone of the place, I believe and trust that you will be truly ashamed  of the remembrance of your appearance in chapel this morning. It is for  this reason I shall not punish you, though you have yourself  acknowledged that punishment would be only an act of justice. As for  the matter of principle to which you referred, so far from advancing  the good fame of your country, you were bringing it into disrepute. If  you imagine it was a particularly patriotic deed to flaunt the shamrock  in a wrong place you are much mistaken. We have had Irish girls here  before, and I have always been able to rely upon them for the  maintenance of our high standard. You may go now, Honor, and remove  that foolish trimming from your hat; and remember that, as you have  been christened 'Honor', I shall expect you to live up to your name.\"    Honor left the room more subdued than she would have cared to  acknowledge. The calm, well-balanced arguments had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24062"],[0,"A History of the United States (#7)"],[1,"Massachusetts very decidedly taking the lead. The taxed tea, on its  arrival in Boston harbour, was seized and flung into the sea. A wise  Government would have withdrawn when it was obvious that the enforcement  of the taxes would cost far more than the taxes themselves were worth,  the more so as they had already been so whittled down by concessions as  to be worth practically nothing, and it is likely enough that the  generally prudent and politic aristocrats who then directed the action  of England would have reverted to the Rockingham policy had not the King  made up his unfortunate German mind to the coercion and humiliation of  the discontented colonists. It is true that the British Crown had long  lost its power of independent action, and that George III. had failed in  his youthful attempts to recapture it. Against the oligarchy combined he  was helpless; but his preference for one group of oligarchs over another  was still an asset, and he let it clearly be understood that such  influence as he possessed would be exercised unreservedly in favour of  any group that would undertake to punish the American rebels. He found  in Lord North a Minister willing, though not without considerable  misgivings, to forward his policy and able to secure for it a majority  in Parliament. And from that moment the battle between the Home  Government and the colonists was joined.    The character and progress of that battle will best be grasped if we  mark down certain decisive incidents which determine its course. The  first of these was the celebrated \"Boston Tea Party\" referred to above.  It was the first act of overt resistance, and it was followed on the  English side by the first dispatch of an armed force--grossly inadequate  for its purpose--to America, and on the American by the rapid arming and  drilling of the local militias not yet avowedly against the Crown, but  obviously with the ultimate intention of resisting the royal authority  should it be pushed too far.    The next turning-point is the decision of the British Government early  in 1774 to revoke the Charter of Massachusetts. It is the chief event of  the period during which war is preparing, and it leads directly to all  that follows. For it raised a new controversy which could not be  resolved by the old legal arguments, good or bad. Hitherto the colonists  had relied upon their interpretation of existing charters, while the  Government contented itself with putting forward a different  interpretation. But the new action of that Government shifted the ground  of debate from the question of the interpretation of the charters to  that of the ultimate source of their authority. The Ministers said in  effect, \"You pretend that this document concedes to you the right of  immunity from taxation. We deny it: but at any rate, it was a free gift  from the British Crown, and whatever rights you enjoy under it you enjoy  during His Majesty's pleasure. Since you insist on misinterpreting it,  we will withdraw it, as we are perfectly entitled to do, and we will  grant you a new charter about the terms of which no such doubts can  arise.\"    It was a very direct and very fundamental challenge, and it inevitably  produced two effects--the one immediate, the other somewhat deferred.  Its practical first-fruit was the Continental Congress. Its ultimate but  unmistakably logical consequence was the Declaration of Independence.    America was unified on the instant, for every colony felt the knife at  its throat. In September a Congress met, attended by the representatives  of eleven colonies. Peyton Randolph, presiding, struck the note of the  moment with a phrase: \"I am not a Virginian, but an American.\" Under  Virginian leadership the Congress vigorously backed Massachusetts, and  in October a \"Declaration of Colonial Right\" had been issued by the  authority of all the colonies represented there.    The British Ministers seem to have been incomprehensibly blind to the  seriousness of the situation. Since they were pledged not to concede  what the colonists demanded, it was essential that they should at once  summon all the forces at their command to crush what was already an  incipient and most menacing rebellion. They did nothing of the sort.  They slightly strengthened the totally inadequate garrison which would  soon have to face a whole people in arms, and they issued a foolish  proclamation merely provocative and backed by no power that could  enforce it, forbidding the meeting of Continental Congresses in the  future. That was in January. In April the skirmishes of Lexington and  Concord had shown how hopelessly insufficient was their military force  to meet even local sporadic and unorganized revolts. In May the second  Continental Congress met, and in July appeared by its authority a  general call to arms addressed to the whole population of America.    Up to this point the colonists, if rebellious in their practical  attitude, had been strictly constitutional in their avowed aims. In the  \"Declaration of Colonial Right\" of 1774, and even in the appeal to arms  of 1775, all suggestion of breaking away from the Empire was repudiated.  But now that the sword was virtually drawn there were practical  considerations which made the most prudent of the rebels consider  whether it would not be wiser to take the final step, and frankly  repudiate the British Sovereignty altogether. For one thing, by the laws  of England, and indeed of all civilized nations, the man who took part  in an armed insurrection against the head of the State committed  treason, and the punishment for treason was death. Men who levied war on  the King's forces while still acknowledging him as their lawful ruler  were really inviting the Government to hang them as soon as it could  catch them. It might be more difficult for the British Government to  treat as criminals soldiers who were fighting under the orders of an  organized _de facto_ government, which at any rate declared itself to be  that of an independent nation. Again, foreign aid, which would not be  given for the purpose of reforming the internal administration of  British dominions, might well be forthcoming if it were a question of  dismembering those dominions. These considerations were just and carried  no little weight; yet it is doubtful if they would have been strong  enough to prevail against the sentiments and traditions which still  bound the colonies to the mother country had not the attack on the  charters forced the controversy back to first principles, and so opened  the door of history to the man who was to provide America with a creed  and to convert the controversy from a legal to something like a  religious quarrel.    Old Peyton Randolph, who had so largely guided the deliberations of the  first Continental Congress, was at the last moment prevented by  ill-health from attending the second. His place in the Virginian  Delegation was taken by Thomas Jefferson.    Jefferson was not yet thirty when he took his seat in the Continental  Congress, but he was already a notable figure in his native State. He  belonged by birth to the slave-holding gentry of the South, though not  to the richest and most exclusive section of that class. Physically he  was long limbed and loose jointed, but muscular, with a strong ugly face  and red hair. He was adept at the physical exercises which the  Southerners cultivated most assiduously, a bold and tireless rider who  could spend days in the saddle without fatigue, and a crack shot even  among Virginians. In pursuit of the arts and especially of music he was  equally eager, and his restless intelligence was keenly intrigued by the  new wonders that physical science was beginning to reveal to men;  mocking allusions to his interest in the habits of horned frogs will be  found in American pasquinades of two generations. He had sat in the  Virginian House of Burgesses and had taken a prominent part in the  resistance of that body to the royal demands. As a speaker, however, he  was never highly successful, and a just knowledge of his own  limitations, combined perhaps with a temperamental dislike, generally  led him to rely on his pen rather than his tongue in public debate. For  as a writer he had a command of a pure, lucid and noble English  unequalled in his generation and equalled by Corbett alone.    But for history the most important thing about the man is his creed. It  was the creed of a man in the forefront of his age, an age when French  thinkers were busy drawing from the heritage of Latin civilizations  those fundamental principles of old Rome which custom and the  corruptions of time had overgrown. The gospel of the new age had already  been written: it had brought to the just mind of Jefferson a conviction  which he was to communicate to all his countrymen, and through them to  the new nation which the sword was creating. The Declaration of  Independence is the foundation stone of the American Republic, and the  Declaration of Independence in its essential part is but an incomparable  translation and compression of the _Contrat Social_. The aid which  France brought to America did not begin when a French fleet sailed into  Chesapeake Bay. It began when, perhaps years before the first whisper of  discontent, Thomas Jefferson sat down in his Virginian study to read the  latest work of the ingenious M. Rousseau.    For now the time was rife for such intellectual leadership as Jefferson,  armed by Rousseau, could supply. The challenge flung down by the British  Government in the matter of the Charter of Massachusetts was to be taken  up. The argument that whatever rights Americans might have they derived  from Royal Charters was to be answered by one who held that their  \"inalienable rights\" were derived from a primordial charter granted not  by King George but by his Maker.    The second Continental Congress, after many hesitations, determined at  length upon a"]]]
