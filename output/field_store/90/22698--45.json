Though her Fellow be never so agreeable, she can pick his  Pocket as coolly, as if money were her only Pleasure. Now that is a  Command of the Passions uncommon in a Woman!    _Jenny._ I never go to the Tavern with a Man, but in the View of  Business. I have other Hours, and other sort of Men for my Pleasure. But  had I your Address, Madam--    _Macheath._ Have done with your Compliments, Ladies; and drink about:  You are not so fond of me, _Jenny_, as you use to be.    _Jenny._ 'Tis not convenient, Sir, to shew my Fondness among so many  Rivals. 'Tis your own Choice, and not the Warmth of my Inclination that  will determine you.      AIR XXIII. All in a misty Morning, &c.

Then One he singles from the Crew,      And cheers the happy Hen;    With how do you do, and how do you do,      And how do you do again.    _Macheath._ Ah _Jenny!_ thou art a dear Slut.    _Jenny._ A Man of Courage should never put any thing to the Risk but his  Life. These are the Tools of a Man of Honour. Cards and Dice are only  fit for cowardly Cheats, who prey upon their Friends.        [She takes up his Pistol. _Tawdry_ takes up the other.    _Tawdry._ This, Sir, is fitter for your Hand. Besides your Loss of  Money, 'tis a Loss to the Ladies. Gaming takes you off from Women. How  fond could I be of you! but before Company 'tis ill bred.    _Macheath._ Wanton Hussies!    _Jenny._ I must and will have a Kiss to give my Wine a Zest.        [They take him about the Neck and make signs to _Peachum_ and      Constables, who rush in upon him.    _Peachum._ I seize you, Sir, as my Prisoner.    _Macheath._ Was this well done, _Jenny_? --Women are Decoy Ducks; who  can trust them! Beasts, Jades, Jilts, Harpies, Furies, Whores!    _Peachum._ Your Case, Mr. _Macheath_, is not particular. The greatest  Heroes have been ruin'd by Women. But, to do them Justice, I must own  they are a pretty sort of Creatures, if we could trust them. You must  now, Sir, take your Leave of the Ladies, and if they have a mind to make  you a Visit, they will be sure to find you at home. This Gentleman,  Ladies, lodges in _Newgate_. Constables, wait upon the Captain to his  Lodgings.      AIR XXIV. When first I laid Siege to my _Chloris_, &c.

[Exit _Macheath_, guarded with _Peachum and Constables_.    _Mrs. Vixen._ Look ye, Mrs. _Jenny_, though Mr. _Peachum_ may have made  a private Bargain with you and _Suky Tawdry_ for betraying the Captain,  as we were all assisting, we ought all to share alike.    _Mrs. Coaxer._ I think Mr. _Peachum_, after so long an Acquaintance,  might have trusted me as well as _Jenny Diver_.    _Mrs. Slammekin._ I am sure at least three Men of his hanging, and in a  Year's time too (if he did me Justice) should be set down to my Account.    _Trull._ Mrs. _Slammekin_, that is not fair. For you know one of them  was taken in Bed with me.    _Jenny._ As far as a Bowl of Punch or a Treat, I believe Mrs. _Suky_  will join with me. --As for any thing else, Ladies, you cannot in  Conscience expect it.    _Mrs. Slammekin._ Dear Madam--    _Trull._ I would not for the World--    _Mrs. Slammekin._ 'Tis impossible for me--    _Trull._ As I hope to be sav'd, Madam--    _Mrs. Slammekin._ Nay, then I must stay here all Night--    _Trull._ Since you command me.

You have not been a Lodger of  mine this Year and half. You know the Custom, Sir. Garnish, Captain,  Garnish. Hand me down those Fetters there.    _Macheath._ Those, Mr. _Lockit_, seem to be the heaviest of the whole  Set. With your Leave, I should like the further Pair better.    _Lockit._ Look ye, Captain, we know what is fittest for our Prisoners.  When a Gentleman uses me with Civility, I always do the best I can to  please him. --Hand them down I say. --We have them of all Prices, from  one Guinea to ten, and 'tis fitting every Gentleman should please  himself.    _Macheath._ I understand you, Sir. [Gives Money.] The Fees here are so  many, and so exorbitant, that few Fortunes can bear the Expence of  getting off handsomly, or of dying like a Gentleman.    _Lockit._ Those, I see, will fit the Captain better-- Take down the  further Pair. Do but examine them, Sir. --Never was better work. --How  genteely they are made! --They will fit as easy as a Glove, and the  nicest Man in _England_ might not be asham'd to wear them. [He puts on  the Chains.] If I had the best Gentleman in the Land in my Custody I  could not equip him more handsomly. And so, Sir-- I now leave you to  your private Meditations.

Does not Man in Marriage itself promise  a hundred things that he never means to perform? Do all we can, Women  will believe us; for they look upon a Promise as an Excuse for following  their own Inclinations. --But here comes _Lucy_, and I cannot get from  her. --Wou'd I were deaf!      Enter _Lucy_.    _Lucy._ You base Man you, --how can you look me in the Face after what  hath passed between us? --See here, perfidious Wretch, how I am forc'd  to bear about the Load of Infamy you have laid upon me-- O _Macheath_!  thou hast robb'd me of my Quiet-- to see thee tortur'd would give me  Pleasure.

From a Man of Honour, his Word is as good as his Bond.    _Lucy._ 'Tis the Pleasure of all you fine Men to insult the Women you  have ruin'd.      AIR XXVII. 'Twas when the Sea was roaring, &c.

And so you think I know nothing of the  Affair of Miss _Polly Peachum_. --I could tear thy Eyes out!    _Macheath._ Sure, _Lucy_, you can't be such a Fool as to be jealous of  _Polly_!    _Lucy._ Are you not married to her, you Brute, you.    _Macheath._ Married! Very good. The Wench gives it out only to vex thee,  and to ruin me in thy good Opinion. 'Tis true, I go to the House; I chat  with the Girl, I kiss her, I say a thousand things to her (as all  Gentlemen do) that mean nothing, to divert myself; and now the silly  Jade hath set it about that I am married to her, to let me know what she  would be at. Indeed, my dear _Lucy_, these violent Passions may be of  ill consequence to a Woman in your Condition.    _Lucy._ Come, come, Captain, for all your Assurance, you know that Miss  _Polly_ hath put it out of your Power to do me the Justice you  promis'd me.    _Macheath._ A jealous Woman believes every thing her Passion suggests.  To convince you of my Sincerity, if we can find the Ordinary, I shall  have no Scruples of making you my Wife; and I know the Consequence of  having two at a time.    _Lucy._ That you are only to be hang'd, and so get rid of them both.    _Macheath._ I am ready, my dear _Lucy_, to give you Satisfaction-- if  you think there is any in Marriage. --What can a Man of Honour say more?    _Lucy._ So then, it seems, you are not married to Miss _Polly_.    _Macheath._ You know, _Lucy_, the Girl is prodigiously conceited. No Man  can say a civil thing to her, but (like other fine Ladies) her Vanity  makes her think he's her own for ever and ever.      AIR XXVIII. The Sun had loos'd his weary Teams, &c.

The  warm summer breeze wafted up to him the hum of the people as they  talked, blaming him for his actions. \"But why blame me?\" says the  irresistible youth, stretching himself at full length in the  sunshine. \"It was the gods that made me as I am: blame them, if you  will!\" And he gave a sigh of satisfaction, \"Hi!\"    The music carries the story well. The swing of the last six bars  suggests his shrug of irresponsibility.    [Music: SONG OF THE INDIAN COQUET.    _Omaha._    Harmonized by PROF. J.C. FILLMORE.

Early in the century there lived an Omaha Indian, a tall and comely  man, gifted with a fine voice and a good memory, and who was greatly  admired by the men and women of the tribe. Although genial with every  one, he was reserved; and none knew all that had transpired in his  life or that occupied his thoughts. He was a prosperous man. His lodge  was well supplied, for his skill as a hunter was equal to his valour  as a warrior.    Years passed; and here and there a silver thread glistened in his  black hair, the furrows deepened in his handsome face, and more and  more his thoughts seemed to dwell on the past. One day he was heard  singing a love-song of his own composition, and gossip became busy as  to what this song might mean. His actions threw no light on the  mystery. He was the same kind husband and father, the same diligent  provider, and he sought no new companionship. Nevertheless, at every  dawn he went upon the hill near his lodge; and, while the morning star  hung like a jewel in the east, he sang the melody carrying the  words,--         \"With the dawn I seek thee!\"    [Music: THE OLD MAN'S LOVE SONG.    _Omaha._    Harmonized by PROF. J.C. FILLMORE.    Ha he ha ha he ha he ha we dhe ha dha e ha dhoe,  Um-ba e-don ha-i-don, hu-wi-ne ha, ho e ho wa dho he dhe,  I ha, ha he ho, ho he ho, he ha we dhe dhoe.  Un-ba i-don ha-i-don, hu-wi ne ha, ho e ho ne dho he.]    The young men caught the tune, and sang it as they wooed the maidens;  and the old man smiled as he heard them. \"Yes, they are right,\" he  said. \"It is a love-song.\"    He grew to be a very old man, an old man with a love-song, until it  was only when the warm days came that he could slowly climb the hill  at dawn, and, alone with the breezes and birds, greet the new day with  his song, that both kept and revealed his secret,--the secret of a  love, like the radiant bow, spanning the whole horizon of his life. At  last a time came when his voice was no longer heard.    The tender cadences of his song, fraught with human hope and human  feeling, still linger, and to-day awaken echoes across the barriers of  time and race.          STORY OF THE WE-TO'_N_ SONG.      Many Indian tribes believed it possible for one person to affect  another through the power of the will. This belief gave rise to  peculiar customs and to a class of songs called, in the Omaha tongue,  We'-to_n_, composed and sung by women for the sole purpose of exerting  this power for the benefit of absent warriors.    Unless the village was attacked, women did not take active part in  war. When the men went forth on a long journey to meet the enemy, the  women remained at home, attending to domestic duties. Their thoughts,  however, were with the absent ones; and, under the incentive of the  belief in will power, they would gather in groups at the lodge of the  Leader of the war party, and in the hearing of his family would sing a  We'-to_n_ song, which should carry strength to the far-away warriors  and help them to win the battle.    The words of these songs do not reveal the purpose for which they were  sung, it being one of the peculiarities of the Indian never to  expatiate upon that which to him is apparent. The gathering of the  women at the lodge of the Leader of the war party, the united action  in singing a song never used but for one purpose, made any explanatory  words seem unnecessary. The distinctive mission of the song was to  reach the absent man, who, far from home, was suffering hardship and  facing danger. Upon him the singers fixed their thoughts, and to him  sent strength by their power of will. The words always referred to the  difficulties that confronted the warrior, and promised him success and  victory. They were not addressed to any visible audience.    The We'-to_n_ song here given was composed by a Dakota woman.           *       *       *       *       *    Many years ago a large party of warriors were out on a dangerous  expedition for the purpose of recapturing some property stolen by an  implacable enemy. There seemed little hope for their safe return, and  great apprehension was felt in many a tent. One evening, as the moon  rose, round and clear, over the wide rolling prairie, a group of women  moved in single file to the lodge of the Leader of the war party, upon  whom rested the responsibility of the expedition.    The tent stood dark against the evening sky, revealing the anxiety  within, which had let the blazing fire die to smouldering embers. At  the door the women paused, and across the stillness of the night they  sent forth this song, fraught with their united determination to  compel victory for the absent men.    \"All the tribes shall hear of you,\" they sang. \"Put forth your  strength. Truly this shall come to pass.\"    Out of the silent tent emerged the Leader's wife, bearing in her arms  gifts in acknowledgment of sympathy given and of succour sent.           *       *       *       *       *    And, as the women sang, \"truly it came to pass.\" In due time the men  returned triumphant, after many hair-breadth escapes, with not one of  their number missing.

There is no dalliance in this Pawnee love-song. It has no words, but  the music tells the story,--the insistent call of the lover to the  maiden to fly with him, the wide sweep of the prairie, the race for  cover, and the dauntless daring that won the girl from rival  pursuers.    [Music: LOVE SONG.    _Pawnee._    Transcribed by E.S. TRACY.]          A WARRIOR'S STORY AND SONG.      The Mi'-ka-thi songs are sung by warriors as they leave the village on  their way to battle. They all originate in some personal experience,  and both story and song are handed down with care and precision.           *       *       *       *       *    A Ponka war party once camped near the enemy. The usual sentinels had  been stationed, with special injunctions to be vigilant, that the camp  might not be discovered and surprised. Among those assigned to duty as  sentinel that night was a young man ambitious to win preferment and  honour in the tribe. His career was yet all to make, and he was on the  alert for opportunity to distinguish himself.    There was no moon, and only the keenest eye could discern any distant  object in the darkness. The silence was unbroken save by the  occasional cry of the wolf, the creaking of a cricket, or the rustle  of a passing breeze.    The young man, intently on the watch, scanned the country from right  to left, searching through the dimness for any moving thing; but all  was motionless beneath, while overhead the stars moved slowly through  the heavens, as the night wore on.    At a little distance from the watcher was a clump of trees. Upon this  he kept a steady eye, only turning now and then to sweep the horizon.  Once, as his eye returned to the trees, he beheld a shadow unnoticed  before. It moved; and, without waiting to see more, he sped  noiselessly as an arrow to wake the Leader and report that he had seen  the enemy creeping toward the sleeping warriors.    The Leader, an old and experienced man, made no reply, but rose  quickly and silently, and taking his bow in his hand, motioned the  sentinel to lead the way.    With rapid, muffled steps, they reached the place where the young man  had stood when he had seen the moving shadow. The Leader looked  intently in the indicated direction, bent his ear to the ground and  listened, then rose and looked again.    A faint gleam of light in the east gave sign of the approach of day,  as the Leader stepped cautiously toward the group of trees, followed  by the young warrior, whose heart beat high with hope that the time  had at last come for him to show his valour and win a war honour. A  greyish hue was spreading over the land as they neared the place. The  young man's eyes sought among the trees the hidden enemy, but the  Leader paused and addressed the youth:--    \"Was it here that you saw the enemy?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Look on the ground and tell me what you see?\"    Surprised at the words, yet obedient, he turned his scrutiny from the  trees to the grass upon which they stood, and detected there the  traces of the feet of an animal. As he gazed silently at the tracks,  absorbed in his thoughts, the dawn came slowly on. The Leader was the  first to speak:--    \"I had seen a wolf pass here when I was going the rounds of the camp,  and when you reported to me I had but just returned to my bed. I arose  and came with you, to be quite sure that we had both looked in the  same direction and had seen the same thing. A warrior must learn to  distinguish a man from a wolf, even in the darkness of midnight.\"    The youth heard the words in silence. At last he said, \"A warrior has  much to learn; and it is well if, while he learns, he brings no  trouble to his friends.\" Then, standing beside the veteran Leader, in  the light of the coming day, he suddenly broke into song, voicing  there on "]]]
