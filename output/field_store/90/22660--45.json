That was the kind of a man he had been a week ago. What was he  now--to-night--here in this waste corner of the world with the light  from a kitchen window blazing on him as though it were the flashing  splendor streaming through the barred portals of paradise? Was it  possible that he, John Benton Marche, could be actually in love--in love  with the daughter of his own game warden--with a girl who served him at  supper in apron and gingham, who served him further in hip boots and  ragged jacket--this modern Rosalind of the marshes, as fresh and  innocent, as modest and ardent, as she of the Arden glades?    The kitchen door opened, and Molly Herold came down the steps and  straight toward him, unthinkingly, almost instinctively, laying her  hands in his as he met her under the leafless China tree in the yard.    \"I was longer than usual to-night,\" she said, \"trying to soften my hands  with that cold cream you so kindly sent for.\" She lifted them in the  starlight with a little laugh. \"They're a trifle better, I think,\" she  said, \"but they're always in water, you know, either there,\" she glanced  around at the kitchen, \"or yonder with the decoys. But thank you all the  same,\" she added brightly. \"Are you going to have another delightful  talk, now?\"    \"Do you care to?\"    \"Of course. The idea of my not caring to talk to you,\" she said,  laughing at the absurdity. \"Shall we go into the sitting room, or walk  in the starlight? There are no snakes out, yet,\" she assured him,  \"though if this weather holds, the moccasins will come out.\"    \"We'll walk down to the shore,\" he said.    \"One moment, then.\" She turned and sped to the house, reappearing, after  a few minutes, wearing her ragged shooting coat.    \"Is your father comfortable?\" he asked.    \"Yes, thank you.\"    \"Do you think he might want you?\"    \"No. Jim sleeps next to him, and he is preparing for bed, now.\" She  smiled. \"What a darling my brother is, isn't he, Mr. Marche?\"    \"He's a fine boy.\"    They moved on together, down the rutted lane, between dismantled fences  and ragged, leafless hedges. She was lithe and light and sure footed,  but once or twice, as they skirted puddles, he supported her; and the  touch of his hand on her body almost unnerved him. Never had he dreamed  that contact with any woman could so thrill, so exquisitely shock. And  every instant he was falling deeper and deeper in love with her. He knew  it--realized it--made no effort to avoid it, fight it off, control it.  It was only his speech and manner that he held desperately under bit and  curb, letting his heart go to everlasting smash and his reason run riot.  And what on earth would be the end he could not imagine, for he was  leaving for the North in the morning, and he had not yet told her.    As they came out upon the shore, the dory loomed up, beached, a dark  silhouette against the starlit water. She laid her hands on the stern  and vaulted lightly to her perch, sliding along to make room for Marche.    From far away in the sound came the confused murmur of wild fowl  feeding. Except for that, and the ceaseless monotone of the outer sea,  there was no sound, not even the lap of water against the bow.    Marche, who had been leaning forward, head bent as though watching the  water, turned to the girl abruptly. \"I want to do something for--Jim,\"  he said.    The girl looked up at him, not understanding.    \"Will your father let me?\"    \"I don't know what you mean.\"    \"I mean that I want to send him to a good school--a good boys' school in  the North.\"    She caught her breath, was silent for a moment, then, amazed: \"_Would_  you do that? Oh, I've wished for it--dreamed of it! But--how can you?  You are so kind--so good to us--but how could we--accept?\"    \"That's why I want to see your father.\"    \"For _that_! Was it really for that, Mr. Marche?\"    \"Yes--partly.\" He swallowed and looked the other way, for the girl's  excited face was very near his own as she bent forward to search his  eyes for the least change of expression--bent nearer as though to  reassure herself that he meant it seriously. For an instant her soft  breath made the night air fragrant; he felt it, faint and fresh on his  cheek, and turned sharply, biting his lips lest he lose all  self-control.    \"Could you and your father spare him?\" he asked carelessly.    \"Oh, if you only would give him that chance!\" she cried. \"But--tell  me--_how_ can we accept such a thing of you? Is it possible?\"    \"Would _you_ accept it?\" he asked, turning toward her.    The question startled her. She looked at him, striving to think clearly,  trying to see this offered miracle through calm, impartial eyes.    \"I--I would do anything--almost--for Jim,\" she said. \"I'd have no pride  left, if his chances lay in the balance. But men--my father--may be  different.\"    He said slowly: \"Suppose I offered the same chance to you?\"    \"What!\" she said crisply.    \"Suppose I offered you a college finishing, Miss Herold. Would you  accept?\"    She slowly grew scarlet under his gaze. \"That would be insulting,\" she  said, in a low voice.    \"Why, when only kindness is meant--as I mean it for Jim?\"    \"It is not the same. I am a grown woman capable of caring for myself.  Such an offer, however kindly meant, could only hurt me, humiliate  me--and--I thought you found me companionable as I am. Friends do not  offer to better each other--in such a way.\"    \"I have not offered it to you, Miss Herold.\"    She looked up, still flushed and brilliant eyed; then her face changed  softly. \"I know it. I was foolishly sensitive. I know you couldn't offer  such a thing to me. But I wish I knew whether we could accept for Jim.  He is such a darling--so intelligent and perfectly crazy for an  education. I've saved a little--that's why I wanted you to hire me for  your bayman. You see I don't spend anything on myself,\" she added, with  a blush.    Marche was fighting hard for self-restraint; he was young and romantic,  and his heart was very full. \"What I'd like to do,\" he said, \"would be  to send Jim to some first-rate school until he is ready for college.  Then I'd like to see him through college, and, if he cared for it, start  him with me in business.\"    \"Oh,\" she cried softly, \"is it possible! Is there--can any man really do  such heavenly things? Have you any idea what you are saying? Do you  realize what you are doing to me--with every word you utter?\"    \"What am I doing to--to you?\" he asked unsteadily.    \"Making me your slave,\" she said, in a low voice, thrilling with  generous passion. \"Even for the thought--even if father will not  accept--what you have said to me to-night has put me in your debt  forever. Truly--truly, I know what friendship is, now.\"    She clasped her hands tightly and said something else, sweetly  incoherent; and, in the starlight, Marche saw the tears sparkling on her  lashes.    With that he sprang nervously to the shore and began to tramp up and  down the shingle, his mind in a whirl, every sense, common or the  contrary, clamoring for finality--urging him to tell her the truth--tell  her that he loved her, that he wanted her--her alone, out of all the  world of women--that it was for love and for her, and for love of her,  that he offered anything, did anything, thought anything now under the  high stars or under the circling sun.    And now, as he tramped savagely to and fro, he realized that he had  begun wrong; that he should have told her he loved her first of all, and  then acted, not promised.    Would she look on his offer scornfully, now? Would she see, in what he  asked of her, a bribe desired for the offer he had made in her brother's  behalf? She did not love him. How could she, in a week? Never had there  been even a hint of sentiment between them. What would she think--this  young girl, so tranquilly confident in her friendship for him--what  would she think of him and his love? He knew there was nothing  mercenary or material in her character; he knew she was young, sweet  tempered, reticent concerning herself, clean hearted, and proud. How  could he come blundering through the boundaries of her friendship with  such an avowal, at a moment's notice?    He returned slowly to the boat and stood looking up at her; and he saw  that she was smiling down at him in the starlight.    \"Why did you start off so abruptly and tramp up and down?\" she asked.    He looked up at her. \"Shall we walk back, now?\" he said.    She extended her hands to him, and he swung her to the beach. For a  moment he retained her hands; she looked at him, smiling, thrilling with  all that he had said, meeting his eyes frankly and tenderly.    \"You are like some glorious magic prince to me,\" she said, \"appearing  among us here to win our hearts with a word.\"    \"Have I won yours with what I have said?\"    \"Mine? Oh, don't you know it? Do you think--even if it doesn't come  true--that I can ever forget what you have wished to do for Jim?\"    Still holding her hands, he lifted them, joined her fingers, and laid  his lips to them. She bent her head and caught her breath in surprise.    \"I am going North to-morrow,\" he said.    For a moment she did not comprehend his words. Then, a trifle dazed, she  looked up at him. \"To-morrow?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Are you coming back?\"    \"Perhaps--next year.\"    \"_Next--year!_\"    \"Do you--find it--a long time?\"    Her straight brows bent inward a little, the startled gray eyes became  clear and steady. \"Of course I knew that you must go--some time. But I  had no idea that it would be so soon. Somehow, I have thought of you as  being--here----\"    \"Do you care?\"    Her honest eyes widened. \"Care?\" she repeated.    \"Yes. How greatly do you care?\"    The straight brows contracted still more as she stood considering  him--so close that the fresh and subtle youth of her freshened the night  again with its faint perfume."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2439"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 2 (#7)"],[1," get a good seat was willing to lose it. Nevertheless, to  the dismay of the ministers, many persons on whose votes the court had  absolutely depended were seen moving towards the door. Among them was  Charles Fox, Paymaster of the Forces, and son of Sir Stephen Fox, Clerk  of the Green Cloth. The Paymaster had been induced by his friends to  absent himself during part of the discussion. But his anxiety had become  insupportable. He come down to the Speaker's chamber, heard part of  the debate, withdrew, and, after hesitating for an hour or two between  conscience and five thousand pounds a year, took a manly resolution and  rushed into the House just in time to vote. Two officers of the army,  Colonel John Darcy, son of the Lord Conyers, and Captain James Kendall,  withdrew to the lobby. Middleton went down to the bar and expostulated  warmly with them. He particularly addressed himself to Kendall, a needy  retainer of the court, who had, in obedience to the royal mandate, been  sent to Parliament by a packed corporation in Cornwall, and who had  recently obtained a grant of a hundred head of rebels sentenced to  transportation. \"Sir,\" said Middleton, \"have not you a troop of horse in  His Majesty's service?\" \"Yes, my Lord,\" answered Kendall: \"but my elder  brother is just dead, and has left me seven hundred a year.\"    When the tellers had done their office it appeared that the Ayes were  one hundred and eighty-two, and the Noes one and eighty-three. In that  House of Commons which had been brought together by the unscrupulous use  of chicanery, of corruption, and of violence, in that House of Commons  of which James had said that more than eleven twelfths of the members  were such as he would himself have nominated, the court had sustained a  defeat on a vital question. [21]    In consequence of this vote the expressions which the King had used  respecting the test were, on the thirteenth of November, taken into  consideration. It was resolved, after much discussion, that an address  should be presented to him, reminding him that he could not legally  continue to employ officers who refused to qualify, and pressing him to  give such directions as might quiet the apprehensions and jealousies of  his people. [22]    A motion was then made that the Lords should be requested to join in the  address. Whether this motion was honestly made by the opposition, in  the hope that the concurrence of the peers would add weight to the  remonstrance, or artfully made by the courtiers, in the hope that a  breach between the Houses might be the consequence, it is now impossible  to discover. The proposition was rejected. [23]    The House then resolved itself into a committee, for the purpose of  considering the amount of supply to be granted. The King wanted fourteen  hundred thousand pounds: but the ministers saw that it would be vain to  ask for so large a sum. The Chancellor of the Exchequer mentioned twelve  hundred thousand pounds. The chiefs of the opposition replied that to  vote for such a grant would be to vote for the permanence of the present  military establishment: they were disposed to give only so much as might  suffice to keep the regular troops on foot till the militia could be  remodelled and they therefore proposed four hundred thousand pounds.  The courtiers exclaimed against this motion as unworthy of the House and  disrespectful to the King: but they were manfully encountered. One of  the western members, John Windham, who sate for Salisbury, especially  distinguished himself. He had always, he said, looked with dread and  aversion on standing armies; and recent experience had strengthened  those feelings. He then ventured to touch on a theme which had hitherto  been studiously avoided. He described the desolation of the western  counties. The people, he said, were weary of the oppression of the  troops, weary of free quarters, of depredations, of still fouler crimes  which the law called felonies, but for which, when perpetrated by this  class of felons, no redress could be obtained. The King's servants had  indeed told the House that excellent rules had been laid down for the  government of the army; but none could venture to say that these rules  had been observed. What, then, was the inevitable inference? Did not the  contrast between the paternal injunctions issued from the throne and the  insupportable tyranny of the soldiers prove that the army was even now  too strong for the prince as well as for the people? The Commons might  surely, with perfect consistency, while they reposed entire confidence  in the intentions of His Majesty, refuse to make any addition to a force  which it was clear that His Majesty could not manage.    The motion that the sum to be granted should not exceed four hundred  thousand pounds, was lost by twelve votes. This victory of the ministers  was little better than a defeat. The leaders of the country party,  nothing disheartened, retreated a little, made another stand, and  proposed the sum of seven hundred thousand pounds. The committee divided  again, and the courtiers were beaten by two hundred and twelve votes to  one hundred and seventy. [24]    On the following day the Commons went in procession to Whitehall with  their address on the subject of the test. The King received them on  his throne. The address was drawn up in respectful and affectionate  language; for the great majority of those who had voted for it were  zealously and even superstitiously loyal, and had readily agreed to  insert some complimentary phrases, and to omit every word which the  courtiers thought offensive. The answer of James was a cold and sullen  reprimand. He declared himself greatly displeased and amazed that the  Commons should have profited so little by the admonition which he had  given them. \"But,\" said he, \"however you may proceed on your part, I  will be very steady in all the promises which I have made to you.\" [25]    The Commons reassembled in their chamber, discontented, yet somewhat  overawed. To most of them the King was still an object of filial  reverence. Three more years filled with injuries, and with insults more  galling than injuries, were scarcely sufficient to dissolve the ties  which bound the Cavalier gentry to the throne.    The Speaker repeated the substance of the King's reply. There was, for  some time, a solemn stillness; then the order of the day was read  in regular course; and the House went into committee on the bill for  remodelling the militia.    In a few hours, however, the spirit of the opposition revived. When,  at the close of the day, the Speaker resumed the chair, Wharton, the  boldest and most active of the Whigs, proposed that a time should be  appointed for taking His Majesty's answer into consideration. John Coke,  member for Derby, though a noted Tory, seconded Wharton. \"I hope,\" he  said, \"that we are all Englishmen, and that we shall not be frightened  from our duty by a few high words.\"    It was manfully, but not wisely, spoken. The whole House was in a  tempest. \"Take down his words,\" \"To the bar,\" \"To the Tower,\" resounded  from every side. Those who were most lenient proposed that the offender  should be reprimanded: but the ministers vehemently insisted that he  should be sent to prison. The House might pardon, they said, offences  committed against itself, but had no right to pardon an insult offered  to the crown. Coke was sent to the Tower. The indiscretion of one  man had deranged the whole system of tactics which had been so ably  concerted by the chiefs of the opposition. It was in vain that, at that  moment, Edward Seymour attempted to rally his followers, exhorted  them to fix a day for discussing the King's answer, and expressed his  confidence that the discussion would be conducted with the respect due  from subjects to the sovereign. The members were so much cowed by the  royal displeasure, and so much incensed by the rudeness of Coke, that it  would not have been safe to divide. [26]    The House adjourned; and the ministers flattered themselves that the  spirit of opposition was quelled. But on the morrow, the nineteenth of  November, new and alarming symptoms appeared. The time had arrived for  taking into consideration the petitions which had been presented from  all parts of England against the late elections. When, on the first  meeting of the Parliament, Seymour had complained of the force and fraud  by which the government had prevented the sense of constituent bodies  from being fairly taken, he had found no seconder. But many who had then  flinched from his side had subsequently taken heart, and, with Sir John  Lowther, member for Cumberland, at their head, had, before the recess,  suggested that there ought to be an enquiry into the abuses which had  so much excited the public mind. The House was now in a much more angry  temper; and many voices were boldly raised in menace and accusation. The  ministers were told that the nation expected, and should have, signal  redress. Meanwhile it was dexterously intimated that the best atonement  which a gentleman who had been brought into the House by irregular means  could make to the public was to use his ill acquired power in defence  of the religion and liberties of his country. No member who, in that  crisis, did his duty had anything to fear. It might be necessary to  unseat him; but the whole influence of the opposition should be employed  to procure his reelection. [27]    On the same day it became clear that the spirit of opposition had spread  from the Commons to the Lords, and even to the episcopal bench. William  Cavendish, Earl of Devonshire, took the lead in the Upper House; and he  was well qualified to do so. In wealth and influence he was second to  none of the English nobles; and the general voice designated him as the  finest gentleman of his time. His magnificence, his taste, his talents,  his classical learning, his high spirit, the grace and"]]]
