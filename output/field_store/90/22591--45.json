If the Legislature can  disfranchise at pleasure, it may soon confine all the votes to a small  number of partisans, and establish an aristocracy or an oligarchy; if  it may banish at discretion, without hearing or trial, no man can be  safe. The name of liberty applied to such a government would be a  mockery of common sense.\"[22]    [Footnote 22: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 3, p. 450.]    The differences between Congress and the Legislature respecting the  collection of duties also brought Clinton and Hamilton into conflict.  As early as 1776 Hamilton had considered the question whether Congress  ought not to collect its own taxes by its own agents,[23] and, when a  member of Congress in 1783, he urged it[24] as one of the cardinal  features of an adequate federal system. In 1787 he was a member of the  Legislature. Here he insisted upon having the federal revenue system  adopted by the State. His argument was an extended exposition of the  facts which made such action important.[25] Under the lead of Clinton,  however, New York was willing to surrender the money, but not the  power of collection to Congress.    [Footnote 23: _Republic_, Vol. 1, p. 122.]    [Footnote 24: _Madison Papers_, Vol. 1, pp. 288, 291, 380.]    [Footnote 25: _Works_, Vol. 2, p. 16.]    Meantime, the pitiable condition to which the Confederation had come,  accented the need of a stronger central government. To this end  Clinton and Hamilton seemed for several years to be working in  harmony. In 1780 Clinton had presented to the Legislature the \"defect  of power\" in the Confederation, and, in 1781, John Sloss Hobart and  Egbert Benson, representing New York at a convention in Hartford,  urged the recommendation empowering Congress to apportion taxes among  the States in the ratio of their total population. The next year,  Hamilton, although not a member of the Legislature, persuaded it to  adopt resolutions written by him, declaring that the powers of the  central government should be extended, and that it should be  authorised to provide revenue for itself. To this end \"it would be  advisable,\" continued the resolutions, \"to propose to Congress to  recommend, and to each State to adopt, the measure of assembling a  general convention of the States, specially authorised to revise and  amend the Constitution.\" To Washington's farewell letter, appealing  for a stronger central government, Governor Clinton sent a cordial  response, and in transmitting the address to the Legislature in 1784,  he recommended attention \"to every measure which has a tendency to  cement the Union, and to give to the national councils that energy  which may be necessary for the general welfare.\"[26]    [Footnote 26: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 1, p. 277.]    Nevertheless, Clinton was not always candid. His official  communications read like the utterances of a friend; but his  influence, as disclosed in the acts of 1783 and 1786, reserving to the  State the sole power of levying and collecting duties, clearly  indicate that while he loved his country in a matter-of-fact sort of  way, it meant a country divided, a country of thirteen States each  berating the other, a country of trade barriers and commercial  resentments, a country of more importance to New York and to Clinton  than to other Commonwealths which had made equal sacrifices.    Thus matters drifted until New York and other middle Atlantic States  discovered that it was impossible under the impotent Articles of  Confederation to regulate commerce in waters bordered by two or more  States. Even when New York and New Jersey could agree, Pennsylvania,  on the other side of New Jersey, was likely to withhold its consent.  Friction of a similar character existed between Maryland and Virginia,  North Carolina and Virginia, and Maryland and Pennsylvania. This  compelled Congress to call the convention, to which commissioners from  New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia, assembled  at Annapolis in 1786, to consider the trade and commerce of the United  States, and to suggest measures for the action of Congress. Hamilton  and Egbert Benson were members of this body, the former of whom wrote  the address, afterward adopted, which declared the federal government  inefficient, and proposed a convention to revise the Articles of  Confederation,[27] in order to render them adequate to the exigencies  of the Union. This was the resolution unanimously adopted by the New  York Legislature in 1782, but to the surprise of Hamilton and the  friends of a stronger government, the Legislature now disapproved such  a convention. The idea did not please George Clinton. As Hamilton  summed up the opposition, it meant disinclination to taxation, fear of  the enforcement of debts, democratic jealousy of important officials,  and the influence of foreign powers.[28]    [Footnote 27: _Journal of Congress_, Vol. 12, p. 12.]    [Footnote 28: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 1, p. 401.]    In 1787, however, the Legislature adopted a joint resolution  instructing members of Congress from the State to urge that a  convention be held to amend the Articles of Confederation, and, when  Congress issued the call,[29] Robert Yates, John Lansing, Jr., and  Alexander Hamilton were elected delegates \"for the sole purpose of  revising the Articles of Confederation, and reporting to Congress and  the several Legislatures such alterations as shall, when agreed to by  Congress and confirmed by the several States, render the Federal  Constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the  preservation of the Union.\" Hamilton's election to this convention was  cited as proof of Clinton's disposition to treat fairly the opponents  of state supremacy, since it was well understood that his presence at  Philadelphia would add the ablest and most ultra exponent of a strong,  central government. It was certainly in Clinton's power to defeat  Hamilton as he did John Jay, but his liberality carried a high  check-rein, for Robert Yates and John Lansing were selected to  overcome Hamilton's vote.    [Footnote 29: In _Madison Papers_, Vol. 2, Introductory to Debates of  1787, is a history of previous steps toward union.]    Clinton's first choice for a delegate was Yates, whose criticism of  the work of the convention manifests hostility to a Union. He seemed  to have little conception of what would satisfy the real needs of a  strong government, preferring the vague doctrines of the old Whigs in  the early days of revolution. Lansing was clearer, and, perhaps, less  extreme in his views; but he wanted nothing more than an amendment of  the existing Confederation, known as the New Jersey plan.[30] The  moment, therefore, that a majority favoured the Virginia plan which  contemplated a national government with an executive, legislature,  and judiciary of its own, Lansing and Yates, regarding it a violation  of their instructions, and with the approval of Governor Clinton,  withdrew[31] from the convention and refused to sign the Constitution  after its adoption.[32]    [Footnote 30: \"After an amendment of the first, so as to declare that  'the government of the United States ought to consist of a supreme  legislative, judiciary, and executive,' Lansing moved a declaration  'that the powers of legislation be vested in the United States  Congress.' He stated that if the Jersey plan was not adopted, it would  produce the mischiefs they were convened to obviate. That the  principles of that system were an equality of representation, and  dependence of the members of Congress on the States. That as long as  state distinctions exist, state prejudices would operate, whether the  election be by the States or the people. If there was no interest to  oppress, there was no need of an apportionment. What would be the  effect of the other plan? Virginia would have sixteen, Delaware one  representative. Will the general government have leisure to examine  the state laws? Will it have the necessary information? Will the  States agree to surrender? Let us meet public opinion, and hope the  progress of sentiment will make future arrangements. He would like the  system of his colleague (Hamilton) if it could be established, but it  was a system without example.\"--_Hamilton's MSS. notes_, Vol. 6, p.  77. Lansing's motion was negatived by six to four States, Maryland  being divided.]    [Footnote 31: Yates and Lansing retired finally from the convention on  July 10.]    [Footnote 32: \"That they acted in accordance with Clinton was proved  by his deportment at this time. Unreserved declarations were made by  him, that no good was to be expected from the appointment or  deliberations of this body; that the country would be thrown into  confusion by the measure. Hamilton said 'Clinton was not a man  governed in ordinary cases by sudden impulses; though of an irritable  temper, when not under the immediate influence of irritation, he was  circumspect and guarded, and seldom acted or spoke without  premeditation or design.' When the Governor made such declarations,  therefore, Hamilton feared that Clinton's conduct would induce the  confusion he so confidently and openly predicted, and to exhibit it  before the public in all its deformity, Hamilton published a pointed  animadversion, charging these declarations upon him, and avowing a  readiness to substantiate them.\"--John C. Hamilton, _Life of Alexander  Hamilton_, Vol. 2, p. 528.]    Hamilton doubted if Madison's plan was strong enough to secure the  object in view. He suggested a scheme continuing a President and  Senate during good behaviour, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22594"],[0,"Colonial Records of Virginia (#7)"],[1,"do obtaine unto  themselves by just means a certaine number of the natives' children to  be educated by them in true religion and civile course of life--of  w^{ch} children the most towardly boyes in witt & graces of nature to be  brought up by them in the first elements of litterature, so[218] to be  fitted for the Colledge intended for them that from thence they may be  sente[219] to that worke of conversion.
