Sec. 10. The _modern_ Masters run over with Negligence their Instructions  in all Sorts of _Recitatives_, because in these Days the Study of  Expression is looked upon as unnecessary, or despised as _ancient_: And  yet they must needs see every Day, that besides the indispensable  Necessity of knowing how to sing them, These even teach how to act. If  they will not believe it, let them observe, without flattering  themselves, if among their Pupils they can show an Actor of equal Merit  with _Cortona_ in the Tender;[48] of Baron _Balarini_ in the Imperious;  or other famous Actors that at present appear, tho' I name them not;  having determined in these Observations, not to mention any that are  living, in whatsoever Degree of Perfection they be, though I esteem them  as they deserve.    Sec. 11. A Master, that disregards _Recitative_, probably does not  understand the Words, and then, how can he ever instruct a Scholar in  Expression, which is the Soul of vocal Performance, and without which it  is impossible to sing well? Poor _Gentlemen Masters_ who direct and  instruct Beginners, without reflecting on the utter Destruction you  bring on the Science, in undermining the principal Foundations of it! If  you know not that the _Recitatives_, especially in the vulgar or known  Language, require those Instructions relative to the Force of the Words,  I would advise you to renounce the Name, and Office of _Masters_, to  those who can maintain them; your Scholars will otherwise be made a  Sacrifice to Ignorance, and not knowing how to distinguish the Lively  from the Pathetick, or the Vehement from the Tender, it will be no  wonder if you see them stupid on the Stage, and senseless in a Chamber.  To speak my Mind freely, yours and their Faults are unpardonable; it is  insufferable to be any longer tormented in the Theatres with  _Recitatives_, sung in the Stile of a Choir of _Capuchin_ Friars.    Sec. 12. The reason, however, of not giving more expression to the  _Recitative_, in the manner of those called _Antients_, does not always  proceed from the Incapacity of the Master, or the Negligence of the  Singer, but from the little Knowledge of the _modern_ Composers (we must  except some of Merit) who set it in so unnatural a Taste, that it is not  to be taught, acted or sung. In Justification of the Master and the  Singer let Reason decide. To blame the Composer, the same Reason forbids  me entering into a Matter too high for my low Understanding, and wisely  bids me consider the little Insight I can boast of, barely sufficient  for a Singer, or to write plain Counterpoint. But when I consider I have  undertaken in these Observations, to procure diverse Advantages to  vocal Performers, should I not speak of a Composition, a Subject so  necessary, I should be guilty of a double Fault. My Doubts in this  Perplexity are resolved by the Reflection, that _Recitatives_ have no  Relation to Counterpoint. If That be so, what Professor knows not, that  many theatrical _Recitatives_ would be excellent if they were not  confused one with another; if they could be learned by Heart; if they  were not deficient in respect of adapting the Musick to the Words; if  they did not frighten those who sing them, and hear them, with unnatural  Skips; if they did not offend the Ear and Rules with the worst  Modulations; if they did not disgust a good Taste with a perpetual  Sameness; if, with their cruel Turns and Changes of Keys, they did not  pierce one to the Heart; and, finally, if the Periods were not crippled  by them who know neither Point nor Comma? I am astonished that such as  these do not, for their Improvement, endeavour to imitate the  _Recitatives_ of those Authors, who represent in them a lively image of  Nature, by Sounds which of themselves express the Sense, as much as the  very Words. But to what Purpose do I show this Concern about it? Can I  expect that these Reasons, with all their Evidences, will be found good,  when, even in regard to Musick, Reason itself is no more in the _Mode_?  Custom has great Power. She arbitrarily releases her Followers from the  Observance of the true Rules, and obliges them to no other Study than  that of the _Ritornello's_, and will not let them uselessly employ their  precious Time in the Application to _Recitative_, which, according to  her Precepts, are the work of the Pen, not of the Mind. If it be  Negligence or Ignorance, I know not; but I know very well, that the  Singers do not find their Account in it.    Sec. 13. Much more might still be[49] said on the Compositions of  _Recitative_ in general, by reason of that tedious chanting that offends  the Ear, with a thousand broken Cadences in every Opera, which Custom  has established, though they are without Taste or Art. To reform them  all, would be worse than the Disease; the introducing every time a final  Cadence would be wrong: But if in these two Extremes a Remedy were  necessary I should think, that among an hundred broken Cadences, ten of  them, briefly terminated on Points that conclude a Period, would not be  ill employed. The Learned, however, do not declare themselves upon it,  and from their Silence I must hold myself condemned.    Sec. 14. I return to the Master, only to put him in Mind, that his Duty is  to teach Musick; and if the Scholar, before he gets out of his Hands,  does not sing readily and at Sight, the Innocent is injured without  Remedy from the Guilty.    Sec. 15. If after these Instructions, the Master does really find himself  capable of communicating to his Scholar Things of greater Moment, and  what may concern his farther Progress, he ought immediately to initiate  him in the Study of Church-Airs, in which he must lay aside all the  theatrical effeminate Manner, and sing in a manly Stile; for which  Purpose he will provide him with different natural and easy _Motets_[50]  grand and genteel, mix'd with the Lively and the Pathetick, adapted to  the Ability he has discovered in him, and by frequent Lessons make him  become perfect in them with Readiness and Spirit. At the same time he  must be careful that the Words be well pronounced, and perfectly  understood; that the _Recitatives_ be expressed with Strength, and  supported without Affectation; that in the Airs he be not wanting in  Time, and in introducing some Graces of good Taste; and, above all,  that the final Cadences of the _Motets_ be performed with Divisions  distinct, swift, and in Tune. After this he will teach him that Manner,  the Taste of _Cantata's_ requires, in order, by this Exercise, to  discover the Difference between one Stile and another. If, after this,  the Master is satisfied with his Scholar's Improvement, yet let him not  think to make him sing in Publick, before he has the Opinion of such  Persons, who know more of singing than of flattering; because, they not  only will chuse such Compositions proper to do him Honour and Credit,  but also will correct in him those Defects and Errors, which out of  Oversight or Ignorance the Master had not perceived or corrected.    Sec. 16. If Masters did consider, that from our first appearing in the Face  of the World, depends our acquiring Fame and Courage, they would not so  blindly expose their Pupils to the Danger of falling at the first Step.    Sec. 17. But if the Master's Knowledge extends no farther than the  foregoing Rules, then ought he in conscience to desist, and to recommend  the Scholar to better Instructions. However, before the Scholar arrives  at this, it will not be quite unnecessary to discourse with him in the  following Chapters, and if his Age permits him not to understand me,  those, who have the Care of him, may.          CHAP. VI.    _Observations for a Student._      Before entering on the extensive and difficult Study of the _Florid_, or  _figured Song_, it is necessary to consult the Scholar's Genius; for if  Inclination opposes, it is impossible to force it, and when That  incites, the Scholar proceeds with Ease and Pleasure.    Sec. 2. Supposing, then, that the Scholar is earnestly desirous of becoming  a Master in so agreable a Profession, and being fully instructed in  these tiresome Rudiments, besides many others that may have slipt my  weak Memory; after a strict Care of his Morals, he should give the rest  of his Attention to the Study of singing in Perfection, that by this  Means he may be so happy as to join the most noble Qualities of the Soul  to the Excellencies of his Art.    Sec. 3. He that studies Singing must consider that Praise or Disgrace  depends very much on his Voice which if he has a Mind to preserve he  must abstain from all Manner of Disorders, and all violent Diversions.    Sec. 4. Let him be able to read perfectly, that he may not be put to Shame  for so scandalous an Ignorance. Oh, how many are there, who had need to  learn the Alphabet!    Sec. 5. In case the Master knows not how to correct the Faults in  Pronunciation, let the Scholar endeavour to learn the best by some other  Means; because the not being born[51] in _Tuscany_, will not excuse the  Singer's Imperfection.    Sec. 6. Let him likewise very carefully endeavour to correct all other  Faults that the Negligence of his Master may have passed over.    Sec. 7.

Bull Run itself was a considerable  obstacle, having fairly high banks and running along the Confederate  front like the ditch of a fortress. Three miles in rear stood Manassas  Junction on a moderate plateau intersected by several creeks. The  most important of these creeks, Young's Branch, joined Bull Run on  the extreme left, near the Stone Bridge and Warrenton turnpike,  after flowing through the little valley between the Henry Hill  and Matthews Hill. Three miles in front, across Bull Run, stood  Centreville, the Federal camp and field base during the battle.    Sunday, July 21, 1861, was a beautiful midsummer day. Both armies  were stirring soon after dawn. But a miscarriage of orders delayed  the Confederate offensive so much that the initiative of attack passed  to the Federals, who advanced against the Stone Bridge shortly after  six. This attack, however, though made by a whole division against a  single small brigade, was immediately recognized as a mere feint  when, two hours later, Evans, commanding the Confederate brigade,  saw dense clouds of dust rising above the woods on his left front,  where the road crossed Sudley Springs, nearly two miles beyond his  own left. Perceiving that this new development must be a regular  attempt to turn the whole Confederate left by crossing Bull Run, he  sent back word to Beauregard, posted some men to hold the Stone  Bridge, and marched the rest to crown the Matthews Hill, facing  Sudley Springs a mile away. Meanwhile four of \"Joe\" Johnston's five  Shenandoah brigades--Bee's, Bartow's, Bonham's, and Jackson's--had  been coming over from the right reserve to strengthen Evans at the  Bridge. As the great Federal turning movement developed against the  Confederate left these brigades followed Evans and were themselves  followed by other troops, till the real battle raged not along Bull  Run but across the Matthews Hill and Henry Hill.    Forming the new front at right angles to the old, so as to attack  and defend the Confederate left on the Matthews and Henry Hills,  caused much confusion on both sides; but more on the Federal, as  the Confederates knew the ground better. By eleven Bee had reached  Evans and sent word back to hurry Bartow on. But the Federals,  having double numbers and a great preponderance in guns, soon drove  the Confederates off the Matthews Hill. As the Confederates recrossed  Young's Branch and climbed the Henry Hill the regular artillery of  the Federals limbered up smartly, galloped across the Matthews  Hill, and from its nearer slope plied the retreating Confederates  on the opposite slope with admirably served shell. Under this fire  the raw Confederates ran in confusion, while their uncovered guns  galloped back to find a new position.    [Illustration: _GENERAL T. J. (STONEWALL) JACKSON_  Photograph. In the collection of L. C. Handy, Washington.]    \"Curse them for deserting the guns,\" snapped Imboden, whose battery  came face to face with Jackson's brigade. \"I'll support you,\" said  Jackson, \"unlimber right here.\" At the same time, half-past eleven,  Bee galloped up on his foaming charger, saying, \"General, they're  beating us back.\" \"Then, Sir,\" said Jackson, \"we'll give them the  bayonet\"; and his lips shut tight as a vice.    Bee then went back behind the Henry Hill, where his broken brigade  was trying to rally, and, pointing toward the crest with his sword,  shouted in a voice of thunder: \"Rally behind the Virginians! Look!  There's Jackson standing like a stone wall!\" From that one cry  of battle Stonewall Jackson got his name.    While the rest of the Shenandoahs were rallying, in rear of Jackson,  Beauregard and Johnston came up, followed by two batteries. Miles  behind them, all the men that could be spared from the fords were  coming too. But the Federals on the Matthews Hill were still in  more than double numbers; and they enjoyed the priceless advantage  of having some regulars among them. If the Federal division at the  Stone Bridge had only pushed home its attack at this favorable  moment the Confederates must have been defeated. But the division  again fumbled about to little purpose; and for the second time  McDowell's admirable plan was spoilt.    It was now past noon on that sweltering midsummer day; and there  was a welcome lull for the rallying Confederates while the Federals  were coming down the Matthews Hill, struggling across the swamps  and thickets of Young's Branch, and climbing the Henry Hill. Within  another hour the opposing forces were at close grips again, and  the Federals, flushed with success and steadied by the regulars,  seemed certain to succeed.    Imboden has vividly described his meeting Jackson at this time.  \"The fight was just then hot enough to make him feel well. His  eyes fairly blazed. He had a way of throwing up his left hand with  the open palm towards the person he was addressing; and, as he told  me to go, he made this gesture. The air was full of flying missiles,  and as he spoke he jerked down his hand, and I saw that blood was  streaming from it. I exclaimed, 'General, you are wounded.' 'Only  a scratch--a mere scratch,' he replied; and, binding it hastily  with a handkerchief, he galloped away along his line.\"    Five hundred yards apart the opposing cannon thundered, while the  musketry of the long lines of infantry swelled the deafening roar.  Suddenly two Federal batteries of regulars dashed forward to even  shorter range, covered by two battalions on their flank. But the  gaudy Zouaves of the outer battalion lost formation in their advance;  whereupon \"Jeb\" Stuart, with only a hundred and fifty horsemen,  swooped down and smashed them to pieces by a daring charge. Then,  just as the scattered white turbans went wildly bobbing about,  into the midst of the inner battalion, out rushed the Thirty-third  Virginians, straight at the guns. The battery officers held their  fire, uncertain in the smoke whether the newcomers were friend or  foe, till a deadly volley struck home at less than eighty yards.  Down went the gunners to a man; down went the teams to a horse;  and off ran the Zouaves and the other supporting battalion,  helter-skelter for the rear.    But other Federals were still full of fight and in superior numbers.  They came on with great gallantry, considering they were raw troops  who were now without the comfort of the guns. Once more a Federal  victory seemed secure; and if the infantry had only pressed on  (not piecemeal, by disjoined battalions, but by brigades) without  letting the Confederates recover from one blow before another struck  them, the day would have certainly been theirs. Moreover, they  would have inflicted not simply a defeat but a severe disaster  on their enemy, who would have been caught in flank by the troops  at the Stone Bridge; for these troops, however dilatory, must have  known what to do with a broken and flying Confederate flank right  under their very eyes. Premonitory symptoms of such a flight were  not wanting. Confederate wounded, stragglers, and skulkers were  making for the rear; and the rallied brigades were again in disorder,  with Bee and Bartow, two first-rate brigadiers, just killed, and  other seniors wounded. Another ominous sign was the limbering up  of Confederate guns to cover the expected retreat from the Henry  Hill.    But on its reverse slope lay Jackson's Shenandoahs, three thousand  strong, and by far the best drilled and disciplined brigade that  either side had yet produced--apart, of course, from regulars.  Jackson had ridden up and down before them, calm as they had ever  seen him on parade, quietly saying, \"Steady, men, steady! All's  well.\" In this way he had held them straining at the leash for  hours. Now, at last, their time had come. Riding out to the center  of his line he gave his final orders: \"Reserve your fire till they  come within fifty yards. Then fire and give them the bayonet; and yell  like furies when you charge!\" Five minutes later, as the triumphant  Federals topped the crest, the long gray line rose up, stood fast,  fired one crashing point-blank volley, and immediately charged home  with the first of those wild, high rebel yells that rang throughout  the war. The stricken and astounded Federal front caved in, turned  round, and fled. At the same instant the last of the Shenandoahs--Kirby  Smith's brigade, detrained just in the nick of time--charged the  wavering flank. Then, like the first quiver of an avalanche, a  tremor shook the whole massed Federals one moment on that fatal  hill: the next, like a loosened cliff, they began the landslide  down.    There, in the valley, along Young's Branch, McDowell established  his last line of battle, based on the firm rock of the regulars.  But by this time the Confederates had brought up troops from the  whole length of their line; the balance of numbers was at last in  their favor; and nothing could stay the Federal recoil. Lack of  drill and discipline soon changed this recoil into a disorderly  retreat. There was no panic; but most of the military units dissolved  into a mere mob whose heart was set on getting back to Washington in  any way left open. The regulars and a few formed bodies in reserve  did their best to stem the stream. But all in vain.    One mile short of Centreville there was a sudden upset and consequent  block on the bridge across Cub Run. Then the stream of men retreating,  mixed with clogging masses of panic-struck civilians, became a  torrent.      Bull Run was only a special-constable affair on a gigantic scale.  The losses were comparatively small--3553 killed and wounded on both  sides put together: not ten per cent of the less than forty thousand  who actually fought. Moreover, the side that won the battle lost  the war. And yet Bull Run had many points of very great importance.  In spite of all shortcomings it "]]]
