The scarlet colour of each of these prisoners seems at present to be  inexplicable, and makes these statements still more marvellous.    Professor Bell, in his admirable work on British Quadrupeds speaks of a  long-eared bat which fed from the hand; and if an insect were held  between the lips, it would settle on its master's cheek, and take the  fly from his mouth with great quietness. So accustomed was it to this,  that it would seek his lips when he made a buzzing noise. It folded its  beautiful ears under its arm when it went to sleep, and also during  hibernation. Its cry was acute and shrill, becoming more clear and  piercing when disturbed. It is most frequently seen in towns and  villages. This instance of taming to a certain extent might, perhaps, be  more frequently repeated, if bats were objects of more general  interest.          MOLES.      There is a tribe of animals constantly around our country habitations,  of underground and nocturnal habits, some of which become torpid in  winter. All are timid and unobtrusive, and yet have great influence upon  our welfare; for they check the rapid increase of those worms and  insects which live and breed beneath the soil, and would destroy the  crops which are necessary to our existence. There are certain and  constant characters in their formation, which bring them all under one  group, called Insectivora, or Insect-eating Mammalia, by naturalists;  but among them are smaller groups of individuals, with peculiar  characters, adapted to their different habits.    The mole is an instance of one of these minor groups; which, with one  exception, has a portion of sight in spite of its reputation for being  blind. Its smell and hearing, however, are so acute, that they make up  for the deficiency in the other sense, a highly developed organ for  which, would be very much in the way of an animal which makes its  habitation within the earth, and which rarely comes to the surface in  the day time. Its fore-feet are largest, and powerful muscles enable it  to dig up the soil and roots which oppose the formation of its  galleries, and which are thrown up as they become loosened. The nose,  or snout, is furnished with a bone at the end, with which it pierces the  earth, and in one genus this bone has twenty-two small, cartilaginous  points attached to it, which can be extended into a star. A vein lies  behind the ear of all, the smallest puncture of which causes instant  death.    The food of moles chiefly consists of worms, and the larvae, or grubs of  insects, of which they eat enormous quantities. They are extremely  voracious, and the slightest privation of food drives them to frenzy, or  kills them. They will all eat flesh, and when shut up in a cage without  nourishment, have been known to devour each other. There is a remarkable  instance of a mole, when in confinement, having a viper and a toad given  to it, both of which it killed and devoured. All squeeze out the earthy  matter which is inside worms, before eating them, which they do with the  most eager rapidity. In June and July, they prowl upon the surface of  the ground, generally at night, but they have been seen by day, and this  is the time in which they indulge in fleshy food, for then they catch  small birds, mice, frogs, lizards, and snails; but although when in  confinement one was known to eat a toad, they generally refuse these  reptiles, probably from the acrid humour which exudes from their skin.  They, on these occasions of open marauding, are often caught and  devoured in their turn by owls at night, and dogs by day. They have a  remarkable power of eating the roots of the colchicum, or meadow  saffron, which takes such powerful effect on other animals, and which  they probably swallow for the sake of the larvae or worms upon them. Such  is their antipathy to garlic, that a few cloves put into their runs,  will cause their destruction.    A French naturalist, of the name of Henri Lecourt, devoted a great part  of his life to the study of the habits and structure of moles, and he  tells us, that they will run as fast as a horse will gallop. By his  observations he rendered essential service to a large district in  France, for he discovered that numbers of moles had undermined the banks  of a canal, and that, unless means were taken to prevent the  catastrophe, these banks would give way, and inundation would ensue. By  his ingenious contrivances and accurate knowledge of their habits, he  contrived to extirpate them before the occurrence of further mischief.  Moles, however, are said to be excellent drainers of land, and Mr. Hogg,  the Ettrick Shepherd, used to declare, that if a hundred men and horses  were employed to dress a pasture farm of 1,500 or 2,000 acres, they  would not do it as effectually as moles would do if left to themselves.    The late Earl of Derby possessed a small deserted island, in the Loch of  Clunie, 180 yards from the main land, and as proof that moles swim well,  a number of them crossed the water, and took possession of this place.  They are said to be dragged, as beavers are, by their companions, who  lay hold of their tail, and pull them along while they lie on their  backs, embracing a quantity of soil dug out in forming their runs. The  fur of the mole is very short, fine, and close, and is as smooth and  soft as Genoa velvet.    Moles display a high degree of instinct in the skilful construction of  their subterranean fortresses. Their site is not indicated by those  little mounds of loose earth, which we see raised up at night, and which  mark their hunting excursions, but under a hillock reared by themselves,  and protected by a wall, bank, or roots of a tree. The earth is well  worked, so as to make it compact and hard, and galleries are formed  which communicate with each other. A circular gallery is placed at the  upper part of the mound, and five descending passages lead from this to  a gallery below, which is of larger circumference. Within this lower  gallery is a chamber, which communicates with the upper gallery by three  descending tunnels. This chamber is, as it were, the citadel of the  mole, in which it sleeps.    A principal gallery goes from the lower gallery, in a direct line to the  utmost extent of the ground through which the mole hunts, and from the  bottom of this dormitory is another, which descends farther into the  earth, and joins this great or principal road. Eight or nine other  tunnels run round the hillock at irregular distances, leading from the  lower gallery, through which the mole hunts its prey, and which it  constantly enlarges. During this process it throws up the hillocks which  betray its vicinity to us. The great road is of various depths,  according to the quality of the soil in which it is excavated; it is  generally five or six inches below the surface, but if carried under a  stream, or pathway, it will be occasionally sunk a foot and a half. If  the hillock be very extensive there will be several high-roads, and they  will serve for several moles, but they never trespass on each other's  hunting grounds. If they happen to meet in a road, one is obliged to  retreat, or they have a battle, in which the weakest always comes off  the worst. In a barren soil, the searching galleries are the most  numerous, and those made in winter are the deepest, because the worms  penetrate beyond the line of frost, and the mole is as active in winter  as in warm weather.    The females have a separate chamber made for them, in which they bring  forth their young. This is situated at some distance from the citadel,  and placed where three or four galleries intersect each other. There  they have a bed made of dry grass, or fibres of roots, and four or five  young are born at the same time, which begin to get their own food when  they are half grown.    Like all voracious animals, moles require a large quantity of water,  consequently their run, or fortress, generally communicates with a ditch  or pond. Should these dry up, or the situation be without such  resources, the little architect sinks perpendicular wells, which retain  the water as it drains from the soil.    Moles shift their quarters according to circumstances, and as they swim  well, they migrate across rivers; and in sudden inundations are able,  not to save themselves alone, but their young, to which they are much  attached. The stratagem and caution which they practise in order to  secure a bird are highly curious: they approach without seeming to do  so, but as soon as they are within reach of their prey, they rush upon  it, tear open its body, thrust their snout into the intestines, and  revel in their sanguinary feast. They then sleep for three or four  hours, and awake with renewed appetite.    All mole-catchers will bear testimony to the rapid movements and  consequent difficulty of catching these animals. I have watched a  gardener stand for half an hour by one of the little hillocks of loose  earth, which, from its movement, showed that the mole was there at work,  and remain motionless, spade in hand, and when he saw the earth shake,  dash his weapon into the heap. The mere uplifting of his arm was  sufficient, and before the spade could reach the ground the mole was  gone. He could scarcely reckon on securing his victim once out of  twenty efforts.    No moles are found in the north of Scotland, or in Ireland, which some  attribute to soil and climate; but they exist in other parts of Europe  under similar circumstances.          HEDGEHOGS.      Hedgehogs form one of the small groups of insect-eating mammalia, and  are remarkable for being also able to eat those substances which are  destructive to others; for instance, they "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21986"],[0,"The Dash for Khartoum: A Tale of the Nile Expedition (#7)"],[1,"\"    \"I went head-foremost into a hedge,\" Rupert laughed. \"My foot slipped in  the mud just as I was taking off, and I took a regular header into it.\"    \"And what is the matter with your hand, Wordsworth?\"    \"A beast of a dog bit me. We were going across a field, and the brute  came out from a farmhouse. My wind had gone, and I happened to be last  and he made at me. Some fool has written in a book that if you keep your  eyes fixed upon a dog he will never bite you. I fixed my eye on him like  a gimlet but it did not act, and he came right at me and sprang at me  and knocked me down and got my hand in his mouth, and I don't know what  would have happened if Skinner hadn't pulled a stick out of the hedge,  and rushed back and hit him such a lick across the back that he went off  yelping. Then the farmer let fly with a double-barrelled gun from his  garden; but luckily we were pretty well out of reach, though two or  three shots hit Scudamore on the cheek and ear and pretty nearly drew  blood. He wanted to go back to fight the farmer, but as the fellow would  have reloaded by the time he got there, and there was the dog into the  bargain, we lugged him off.\"    \"Quite an adventurous afternoon,\" Easton said in a tone of cordial  admiration, which elicited a growl from Skinner.    \"You wish you had been with us, don't you?\" he said, with what was meant  to be a sneer.    \"No, rackets was quite hard work enough for me; and I don't see much fun  in either taking a header into a hedge, being bitten by a farmer's dog,  or being peppered by the man himself. Still, no doubt these things are  pleasant for those who like them. What has become of Templar?\"    \"He fell into a ditch,\" Wordsworth said; \"and he just was in a state. He  had to go up to the matron for a change of clothes. He will be here in a  minute, I expect.\"    \"Quite a catalogue of adventures. If I had known beforehand that there  was going to be so much excitement I might have been tempted to go with  you. I am afraid, Mossop, I have kept you out of quite a good thing.\"    \"There, shut up Easton!\" Pinkerton said, for he saw that Skinner was at  the point of explosion; \"let us have peace and quiet this first night.  You have got the best of it, there is no doubt. Skinner would admit  that.\"    \"No I wouldn't,\" Skinner interrupted.    \"Never mind whether you would or not, Skinner, it clearly is so. Now,  let us change the conversation. For my part I cannot make out why one  fellow cannot enjoy football and that sort of thing, and another like to  lie on his back in the shade, without squabbling over it. If Skinner  had his own way he would never sit quiet a minute, if Easton had his he  would never exert himself to walk across the room. It is a matter of  taste. I like half and half, but I do not want to interfere with either  of your fancies. Now, it is about time to set to work. I expect there  are a good many holiday tasks not perfect.\"    There was a chorus of assent, and the senior boys went off to their  private studies, and the juniors to the large study, where they worked  under the eye of the house-master.    Skinner's mournful anticipations as to the effect of the want of weight  in the football team were speedily verified. The trial matches were  almost all lost, the team being fairly borne down by the superior weight  of their opponents. There was general exasperation at these disasters,  for River-Smith's House had for some years stood high, and to be beaten  in match after match was trying indeed. Skinner took the matter terribly  to heart, and was in a chronic state of disgust and fury. As Easton  observed to Edgar Clinton:    \"Skinner is becoming positively dangerous. He is like a Scotch terrier  with a sore ear, and snaps at every one who comes near him.\"    \"Still it is annoying,\" Edgar, who thoroughly sympathized with Skinner,  said.    \"Well, yes, it is annoying. I am annoyed myself, and it takes a good  deal to annoy me. I think we ought to do some thing.\"    \"Well, it seems to me that we have been doing all we can,\" Edgar said.  \"I am sure you have, for it was only yesterday Skinner was holding you  up as an example to some of us. He said, 'You ought all to be ashamed of  yourselves. Why, look at that lazy beggar Easton, he works as hard as  the whole lot of you put together. If it was not for him I should say we  had better chuck it altogether.'\"    \"I observe that Skinner has been a little more civil to me lately,\"  Easton said. \"Yes, I do my best. I object to the whole thing, but if  one does play one does not like being beaten. I think we had better have  a talk over the matter together.\"    \"But we are always talking over the matter,\" Edgar objected. \"All the  fellows who had a chance of turning out well have been tried, and I am  sure we play up well together. Every one says that we are beaten just  because we cannot stand their rushes.\"    That afternoon the house was badly beaten by the Greenites in the trial  match, and as there was a special rivalry between Green's and  River-Smith's the disgust not only of the members of the team but of the  whole house was very great. Seven of the seniors met after tea in  Skinner's study to discuss the situation.    \"I don't see any thing to be done,\" Skinner said, after various possible  changes in the team had been discussed; \"it is not play we want, it is  weight. The Greenites must average at least a stone and a half heavier  than we do. I have nothing to say against the playing. We simply cannot  stand against them; we go down like nine-pins. No, I suppose we shall  lose every match this season. But I don't see any use in talking any  more about it. I suppose no one has anything further to suggest.\"    \"Well, yes, I have a few words to say,\" Easton, who had been sitting on  the table and had hitherto not opened his lips, remarked in a quiet  voice.    \"Well, say away.\"    \"It seems to me,\" Easton went on without paying any regard to the  snappishness of Skinner's tone, \"that though we cannot make ourselves  any heavier, weight is not after all the only thing. I think we might  make up for it by last. When fellows are going to row a race they don't  content themselves with practice, they set to and train hard. It seems  to me that if we were to go into strict training and get ourselves  thoroughly fit, it ought to make a lot of difference. We might lose  goals in the first half of the play, but if we were in good training we  ought to get a pull in the second half. By playing up all we knew at  first, and pumping them as much as possible, training ought to tell. I  know, Skinner, you always said we ought to keep ourselves in good  condition; but I mean more than that, I mean strict training--getting up  early and going for a three or four mile run every morning, taking  another run in the afternoon, cutting off pudding and all that sort of  thing, and going in for it heart and soul. It is no use training unless  one does a thing thoroughly.\"    \"Well, one could but try,\" Skinner said. \"There is no reason why one  shouldn't train for football just as one does for rowing or running. You  are the last fellow I should have expected to hear such a proposal from,  Easton, but if you are ready to do it I am sure every one else will be.\"    There was a cordial exclamation of assent from the others.    \"Well, of course it will be a horrible nuisance,\" Easton said  regretfully; \"but if one does go in for a thing of this sort it seems to  me that it must be done thoroughly. And besides, it is very annoying  just at the ticklish point of a game, when you would give anything to be  able to catch the fellow ahead of you with the ball, to find that your  lungs have given out, and that you haven't a cupful of wind left.\"    \"I believe, Easton, that you are a downright humbug,\" Scudamore said;  \"and that while you pretend to hate anything like exertion, you are just  as fond of it as Skinner is.\"    \"Well, at any rate,\" Skinner broke in, \"we will try Easton's suggestion.  From to-night the team shall go into strict training. I will see  River-Smith now and get leave for us to go out at six o'clock every  morning. We will settle about the afternoon work afterwards. Of course  pudding must be given up, and there must be no buying cakes or things of  that sort. New bread and potatoes must be given up, and we must all  agree never to touch anything to drink between meals. We will try the  thing thoroughly. It will be a month before we play our next match with  Green's. If we can but beat them I do not care so much about the  others. There are two or three houses we should have no chance with if  we were to train as fine as a university eight.\"    The rest of the team were at once informed of the determination that had  been arrived at. Had it emanated only from Skinner several of the  members might have protested against the hardship of going into training  for football, but the fact that Easton had proposed it weighed with them  all. If he was ready to take such trouble over the matter no one else  could reasonably object, and the consequence was that, although not  without a good deal of grumbling at being got up before daylight, the  whole team turned out in their flannels and two thick jerseys punctually  at six o'clock.    \"Here is an egg and half cupful of milk for each of you,\" Skinner said  as they gathered below. \"Look sharp and beat up your egg with the milk.  Here is a mouthful of biscuit for each. River-Smith said he did not like  our going out without taking something before we started, and Cornish,  who rowed in the trials at Cambridge, told me that egg and milk was the  best thing to take.\"    Five minutes later, comforted by the egg and milk, the party started.    \"We don't want to go at racing speed,\" Skinner said; \"merely a good  steady trot to make the lungs play. We don't want to pull ourselves down  in weight. I don't think, after the last month's work, we have any fat  among us."]]]
