We call this seemingly unnatural creature the Cowbird, probably because  it is often seen feeding in pastures {57} among cattle, where it  captures many insects disturbed into activity by the movements of the  browsing animals.    The Cowbird lays its eggs in the nests of various other birds,  distributing them about the neighbourhood.  Here they are left to be  hatched and the young to be reared by the foster parents.  Cowbird's  eggs have been found in the nests of nearly one hundred species of  birds, and nearly always the nest of some smaller bird is chosen.  Despite this fact the Cowbird's eggs are often first to hatch.  The  young grow rapidly and, being strong and aggressive, not only secure  the lion's share of the food, but frequently crowd the young of the  rightful owner out of the nest to perish on the ground beneath.    As soon as the young leave the nest the greedy Cowbird follows the  little mother about the thickets, shouting loudly for food.  Its fierce  clamour drowns the weaker cries of the legitimate young, which I have  reason to believe even then often die for lack {58} of nourishment.  So  insistent is the young Cowbird and so persistently does it pursue the  foster parent that it is well cared for and invariably thrives.  It is  no uncommon sight, during the days of June and July, to see a worn,  bedraggled Song Sparrow {59} working desperately in a frantic effort to  feed one or more great hulking Cowbirds twice its size.  It is little  wonder that discerning people are not fond of the Cowbird.  Even the  birds seem to regard it as an outcast from avian society, and rarely  associate with it on friendly terms.  This is the only species of North  American birds that exhibits such depravity.    [Illustration: The Greedy Young Cowbird]    All other birds display great willingness to attend to their home  duties, and often give evidence of keen delight while so engaged.  One  of the most exquisite and dainty forms of bird life found in the United  States is the little Blue-gray Gnatcatcher.  When occupied in building  the nest, which is usually saddled on the limb of some forest tree, the  birds call to each other constantly; and even after the eggs are laid  there is no attempt to restrain their expressions of happiness.  Unlike  the Crow and Jay, that sometimes appropriate the nests of other birds,  these little creatures have no sins to answer for to their neighbours.  One of the most pleasing sights I {60} have witnessed was a male  Gnatcatcher that had relieved his mate at the nest.  He was sitting on  the eggs and, with head thrown back, sang with all his might,  apparently unconscious of the evil which such gaiety might bring upon  his household.          {61}    CHAPTER IV    THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS    There is something fascinating about the word migration.  It sends our  minds back to the dim stories of tribal movements carved on the rocks  by men who wrought in the dawn of history.  We wonder at the compelling  force that drove our ancestors through the forests of northern Germany,  or caused the Aztecs to cross the Mexican deserts.  It calls to  something in our blood, for even the most stolid must at times hearken  to the Pied Piper and with Kipling feel that \"On the other side the  world we're overdue.\"    Man is not alone the possessor of the migrating passion.  Menhaden, in  vast schools, sweep along our Atlantic Coast in their season.  From  unknown regions of the ocean herring and salmon return to {62} the  streams of their nativity when the spirit of migration sweeps over the  shoals into the abysmal depths.  There are butterflies that in  companies rise from mud puddles beside the road and go dancing away to  the South in autumn.  The caribou, in long streams, come southward over  the barrens of Labrador when the word is passed, and even squirrels,  over extended regions, have been known to migrate en masse for hundreds  of miles.  There is, however, no phase of the life of birds which is  quite so distinctive.  The extent and duration of their migrations are  among the most wonderful phenomena of the natural world.    Ornithologists have gathered much information regarding their coming  and going, but knowledge on many of the points involved is incomplete.  It is only of recent years that the nest of the Solitary Sandpiper has  been found, and yet this is a very common bird in the eastern United  States in certain seasons.  Where is the scientist who can yet tell us  in what country the common Chimney Swift {63} passes the winter, or  over what stretches of sea and land the Arctic Tern passes when  journeying between its summer home in the Arctic seas and its winter  abode in the Antarctic wastes?  The main fact, however, that the great  majority of birds of the Northern Hemisphere go south in autumn and  return in spring, is well known.    _Moulting._--By the time the young are able to care for themselves the  plumage of the hard-working parents is worn and frayed and a new suit  of feathers becomes necessary.  They do not acquire this all at once.  The feathers drop out gradually from the various feather tracts over  the body, and their places are at once taken by a new growth.  While  this is going on the birds are less in evidence than at other times.  They keep out of sight and few song notes are heard.  Perhaps there is  some irritation and unpleasantness connected with moulting which causes  a dejection of spirit.    With swimming water birds the wing quills disappear nearly all at once  and the birds are unable {64} for a short time to fly; but being at  home in the water, where they secure their food, they are not left in  the helpless, even desperate, condition in which a land bird would find  itself if unable to fly.  In a few cases birds begin to migrate before  this moulting takes place, but with the great majority the moult is  complete before they leave their summer homes.    _Why Birds Migrate._--Why birds migrate we can only conjecture.  Without doubt the growing scarcity of food in autumn is the controlling  factor with many of them; and this would seem to be an excellent reason  for leaving the region of their summer sojourn.  Cold weather alone  would not drive all of them southward, else why do many small birds  pass the winter in northern latitudes where severe climatic conditions  prevail?  Should we assume the failing food supply to be the sole cause  of migration, we would find ourselves at fault when we came to consider  that birds leave the tropic regions in spring, when food is still  exceedingly abundant, and journey northward thousands of miles to their  former summer haunts.    [Illustration: Young robins quarreling at their bath.  Photographed in  the yard of Mrs. Granville Pike, North Yakima, Washington]    {65}    There is a theory held by many naturalists that the migrating instinct  dates back to the glacial period.  According to this theory North  America was inhabited originally by non-migrating birds.  Then the  great Arctic ice-cap began to move southward and the birds were forced  to flee before it or starve.  Now and then during the subsequent period  the ice receded and the birds returned, only to be driven again before  the next onrush of the Ice King.  Thus during these centuries of  alternate advance and retreat of the continental glacier, the birds  acquired a habit, which later became an instinct, of retreating  southward upon the approach of cold weather and coming back again when  the ice and snow showed indications of passing away.    _The Gathering Flocks._--To the bird student there is keen delight in  watching for the first spring arrivals and noting their departure with  the dying year.  It is usually in August that we first observe an  unwonted restlessness on the part of our birds which tells us that they  have begun to hear the call of the {66} South.  The Blackbirds assemble  in flocks and drift aimlessly about the fields.  Every evening for  weeks they will collect a chattering multitude in the trees of some  lawn, or in those skirting a village street, and there at times cause  great annoyance to their human neighbours.    Across the Hudson River from New York, in the Hackensack marshes,  behind the Palisades, clouds of Swallows collect in the late summer  evenings, and for many days one may see them from the car windows as  they glide through the upper air or swarm to roost among the rushes.  These Swallows and the Blackbirds are getting together before starting  on their fall migration.    In Greensboro, North Carolina, there is a small grove of trees  clustered about the courthouse which is a very busy place during the  nights of summer.  Here, before the first of July, Purple Martins begin  to collect of an evening.  In companies of hundreds and thousands, they  whirl about over the tops of the houses, alight in the trees, and then  almost {67} immediately dash upward and away again.  Not till dark do  they finally settle to roost.  Until late at night a great chorus of  voices may be heard among the branches.  The multitude increases daily  for six or eight weeks, additions, in the form of new family groups,  constantly augmenting their numbers.  Some time in September the  migration call reaches the Martins, and, yielding to its spell, they at  once depart toward their winter home in tropical South America.    _The Usual Movement._--Many of our smaller birds, such as Warblers and  Vireos, do not possess a strong flocking instinct, but, nevertheless,  they may be seen associated in numbers during the season of the  northern and southern movements.  Such birds migrate chiefly at night  and have been observed through telescopes at high altitudes.  Such  observations are made by pointing the telescope at the disk of the full  moon on clear nights.
