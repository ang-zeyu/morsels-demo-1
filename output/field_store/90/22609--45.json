I daresay it did as much good as his pills. Very often the mother  believed that it was not really sickness that was troubling her child,  but that a ghost was coming and hurting him; so when his cries showed  that the ghost was in the room, the mother would rise up, shaking all  over, I daresay, and would repeat the verse that she had been taught  would drive ghosts away:        \"Comest thou to kiss this child? I suffer thee not to kiss him;       Comest thou to quiet him? I suffer thee not to quiet him;       Comest thou to harm him? I suffer thee not to harm him;       Comest thou to take him away? I suffer thee not to take him away.\"    When little Tahuti has got over his baby aches, and escaped the ghosts,  he begins to run about and play. He and his sister are not bothered to  any great extent with dressing in the mornings. They are very particular  about washing, but as Egypt is so hot, clothes are not needed very much,  and so the little boy and girl play about with nothing at all on their  little brown bodies except, perhaps, a narrow girdle, or even a single  thread tied round the waist. They have their toys just like you. Tahuti  has got a wonderful man, who, when you pull a string, works a roller up  and down upon a board, just like a baker rolling out dough, and besides  he has a crocodile that moves its jaws. His sister has dolls: a fine  Egyptian lady and a frizzy-haired, black-faced Nubian girl. Sometimes  they play together at ninepins, rolling the ball through a little gate.    For about four years this would go on, as long as Tahuti was what the  Egyptians called \"a wise little one.\" Then, when he was four years old,  the time came when he had to become \"a writer in the house of books,\"  which is what the Egyptians called a school-boy; so little Tahuti set  off for school, still wearing no more clothes than the thread tied round  his waist, and with his black hair plaited up into a long thick lock,  which hung down over his right ear. The first thing that he had to learn  was how to read and write, and this was no easy task, for Egyptian  writing, though it is very beautiful when well done, is rather difficult  to master, all the more as there were two different styles which had to  be learned if a boy was going to become a man of learning. I don't  suppose that you think your old copy-books of much importance when you  are done with them; but the curious thing is that among all the books  that have come down to us from ancient Egypt, there are far more old  copy-books than any others, and these books, with the teachers'  corrections written on the margins, and rough sketches scratched in here  and there among the writing, have proved most valuable in telling us  what the Egyptians learned, and what they liked to read; for a great  deal of the writing consisted in the copying out of wise words of the  men of former days, and sometimes of stories of old times.    These old copy-books can speak to us in one way, but if they could speak  in another, I daresay they would tell us of many weary hours in school,  and of many floggings and tears; for the Egyptian school-master  believed with all his heart in the cane, and used it with great vigour  and as often as he could. Little Tahuti used to look forward to his  daily flogging, much as he did to his lunch in the middle of the day,  when his careful mother regularly brought him three rolls of bread and  two jugs of beer. \"A boy's ears,\" his master used to say, \"are on his  back, and he hears when he is beaten.\" One of the former pupils at his  school writing to his teacher, and recalling his school-days, says: \"I  was with thee since I was brought up as a child; thou didst beat my  back, and thine instructions went into my ear.\" Sometimes the boys, if  they were stubborn, got punishments even worse than the cane. Another  boy, in a letter to his old master, says: \"Thou hast made me buckle to  since the time that I was one of thy pupils. I spent my time in the  lock-up, and was sentenced to three months, and bound in the temple.\" I  am afraid our schoolboys would think the old Egyptian teachers rather  more severe than the masters with whom they have to do nowadays.    Lesson-time occupied about half the day, and when it came to an end the  boys all ran out of the school, shouting for joy. That custom has not  changed much, anyway, in all these hundreds of years. I don't think they  had any home lessons to do, and so, perhaps, their school-time was not  quite so bad as we might imagine from the rough punishments they used to  get.    When Tahuti grew a little older, and had fairly mastered the rudiments  of writing, his teacher set him to write out copies of different  passages from the best known Egyptian books, partly to keep up his  hand-writing, and partly to teach him to know good Egyptian and to use  correct language. Sometimes it was a piece of a religious book that he  was set to copy, sometimes a poem, sometimes a fairy-tale. For the  Egyptians were very fond of fairy-tales, and later on, perhaps, we may  hear some of their stories, the oldest fairy-stories in the world. But  generally the piece that was chosen was one which would not only  exercise the boy's hand, and teach him a good style, but would also help  to teach him good manners, and fill his mind with right ideas. Very  often Tahuti's teacher would dictate to him a passage from the wise  advice which a great King of long ago left to his son, the Crown Prince,  or from some other book of the same kind. And sometimes the exercises  would be in the form of letters which the master and his pupils wrote as  though they had been friends far away from one another. Tahuti's  letters, you may be sure, were full of wisdom and of good resolutions,  and I dare say he was just about as fond of writing them as you are of  writing the letters that your teacher sometimes sets as a task for you.    When it came to Arithmetic, Tahuti was so far lucky that the number of  rules he had to learn was very few. His master taught him addition and  subtraction, and a very slow and clumsy form of multiplication; but he  could not teach him division, for the very simple reason that he did not  properly understand it himself. Enough of mensuration was taught him to  enable him to find out, though rather roughly, what was the size of a  field, and how much corn would go into a granary of any particular size.  And when he had learned these things, his elementary education was  pretty well over.    [Illustration: Plate 7  NAVE OF THE TEMPLE AT KARNAK. _Pages_ 75, 76]    Of course a great deal would depend on the profession he was going to  follow. If he was going to be only a common scribe, his education  would go no farther; for the work he would have to do would need no  greater learning than reading, writing, and arithmetic. If he was going  to be an officer in the army, he entered as a cadet in a military school  which was attached to the royal stables. But if he was going to be a  priest, he had to join one of the colleges which belonged to the  different temples of the gods, and there, like Moses, he was instructed  in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was taught all the strange ideas  which they had about the gods, and the life after death, and the  wonderful worlds, above and below, where the souls of men lived after  they had finished their lives on earth.    But, whether his schooling was carried on to what we should call a  University training or not, there was one thing that Tahuti was taught  with the utmost care, and that was to be very respectful to those who  were older than himself, never to sit down while an older person was  standing in the room, and always to be very careful in his manners.  Chief of the older people to whom he had to show respect were his  parents, and above all, his mother, for the Egyptians reverenced their  mothers more than anyone else in the world. Here is a little scrap of  advice that a wise old Egyptian once left to his son: \"Thou shalt never  forget what thy mother has done for thee. She bare thee, and nourished  thee in all manner of ways. She nursed thee for three years. She brought  thee up, and when thou didst enter the school, and wast instructed in  the writings, she came daily to thy master with bread and beer from her  house. If thou forgettest her, she might blame thee; she might lift up  her hands to God, and He would hear her complaint.\" Children nowadays  might do a great deal worse than remember these wise words of the  oldest book in the world.    But you are not to think that the Egyptian children's life was all  teaching and prim behaviour. When Tahuti got his holidays, he would  sometimes go out with his father and mother and sister on a fishing or  fowling expedition. If they were going fishing, the little papyrus skiff  was launched, and the party paddled away, armed with long thin spears,  which had two prongs at the point. Drifting over the quiet shallow  waters of the marshy lakes, they could see the fish swimming beneath  them, and launch their spears at them. Sometimes, if he was lucky,  Tahuti's father would pierce a fish with either prong of the spear, and  then there was great excitement.    But still more interesting was the fowling among the marshes. The spears  were laid aside on this kind of expedition, and instead, Tahuti and his  father were armed with curved throw-sticks, shaped something like an  Australian boomerang. But, besides the throw-sticks, they had with them  a rather unusual helper. When people go shooting nowadays, they take  dogs with them to retrieve the game. Well, the Egyptians had different  kinds of dogs, too, which they used for hunting; but when they went  fowling they took with them a cat which was trained to catch the wounded  birds and bring them to her master. The little skiff was paddled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22816"],[0,"The Adventures of Buster Bear (#7)"],[1," But  it was only for a second, and then he was scurrying off as fast as a  frightened Squirrel could. Buster Bear watched him and grinned.    \"I didn't catch him that time,\" he growled, \"but I guess I gave him a  good fright and taught him a lesson.\"          XVII    BUSTER BEAR GOES BERRYING      Buster Bear is a great hand to talk to himself when he thinks no one is  around to overhear. It's a habit. However, it isn't a bad habit unless  it is carried too far. Any habit becomes bad, if it is carried too far.  Suppose you had a secret, a real secret, something that nobody else knew  and that you didn't want anybody else to know. And suppose you had the  habit of talking to yourself. You might, without thinking, you know,  tell that secret out loud to yourself, and some one might, just might  happen to overhear! Then there wouldn't be any secret. That is the way  that a habit which isn't bad in itself can become bad when it is  carried too far.    Now Buster Bear had lived by himself in the Great Woods so long that  this habit of talking to himself had grown and grown. He did it just to  keep from being lonesome. Of course, when he came down to the Green  Forest to live, he brought all his habits with him. That is one thing  about habits,--you always take them with you wherever you go. So Buster  brought this habit of talking to himself down to the Green Forest, where  he had many more neighbors than he had in the Great Woods.    \"Let me see, let me see, what is there to tempt my appetite?\" said  Buster in his deep, grumbly-rumbly voice. \"I find my appetite isn't what  it ought to be. I need a change. Yes, Sir, I need a change. There is  something I ought to have at this time of year, and I haven't got it.  There is something that I used to have and don't have now. Ha! I know! I  need some fresh fruit. That's it--fresh fruit! It must be about berry  time now, and I'd forgotten all about it. My, my, my, how good some  berries would taste! Now if I were back up there in the Great Woods I  could have all I could eat. Um-m-m-m! Makes my mouth water just to think  of it. There ought to be some up in the Old Pasture. There ought to be a  lot of 'em up there. If I wasn't afraid that some one would see me, I'd  go up there.\"    Buster sighed. Then he sighed again. The more he thought about those  berries he felt sure were growing in the Old Pasture, the more he wanted  some. It seemed to him that never in all his life had he wanted berries  as he did now. He wandered about uneasily. He was hungry--hungry for  berries and nothing else. By and by he began talking to himself again.    \"If I wasn't afraid of being seen, I'd go up to the Old Pasture this  very minute. Seems as if I could taste those berries.\" He licked his  lips hungrily as he spoke. Then his face brightened. \"I know what I'll  do! I'll go up there at the very first peep of day to-morrow. I can eat  all I want and get back to the Green Forest before there is any danger  that Farmer Brown's boy or any one else I'm afraid of will see me.  That's just what I'll do. My, I wish to-morrow morning would hurry up  and come.\"    Now though Buster didn't know it, some one had been listening, and that  some one was none other than Sammy Jay. When at last Buster lay down  for a nap, Sammy flew away, chuckling to himself. \"I believe I'll visit  the Old Pasture to-morrow morning myself,\" thought he. \"I have an idea  that something interesting may happen if Buster doesn't change his  mind.\"    Sammy was on the lookout very early the next morning. The first Jolly  Little Sunbeams had only reached the Green Meadows and had not started  to creep into the Green Forest, when he saw a big, dark form steal out  of the Green Forest where it joins the Old Pasture. It moved very  swiftly and silently, as if in a great hurry. Sammy knew who it was: it  was Buster Bear, and he was going berrying. Sammy waited a little until  he could see better. Then he too started for the Old Pasture.          XVIII    SOMEBODY ELSE GOES BERRYING      Isn't it funny how two people will often think of the same thing at the  same time, and neither one know that the other is thinking of it? That  is just what happened the day that Buster Bear first thought of going  berrying. While he was walking around in the Green Forest, talking to  himself about how hungry he was for some berries and how sure he was  that there must be some up in the Old Pasture, some one else was  thinking about berries and about the Old Pasture too.    \"Will you make me a berry pie if I will get the berries to-morrow?\"  asked Farmer Brown's boy of his mother.    Of course Mrs. Brown promised that she would, and so that night Farmer  Brown's boy went to bed very early that he might get up early in the  morning, and all night long he dreamed of berries and berry pies. He was  awake even before jolly, round, red Mr. Sun thought it was time to get  up, and he was all ready to start for the Old Pasture when the first  Jolly Little Sunbeams came dancing across the Green Meadows. He carried  a big tin pail, and in the bottom of it, wrapped up in a piece of paper,  was a lunch, for he meant to stay until he filled that pail, if it took  all day.    Now the Old Pasture is very large. It lies at the foot of the Big  Mountain, and even extends a little way up on the Big Mountain. There is  room in it for many people to pick berries all day without even seeing  each other, unless they roam about a great deal. You see, the bushes  grow very thick there, and you cannot see very far in any direction.  Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had climbed a little way up in the sky by the  time Farmer Brown's boy reached the Old Pasture, and was smiling down on  all the Great World, and all the Great World seemed to be smiling back.  Farmer Brown's boy started to whistle, and then he stopped.    \"If I whistle,\" thought he, \"everybody will know just where I am, and  will keep out of sight, and I never can get acquainted with folks if  they keep out of sight.\"    You see, Farmer Brown's boy was just beginning to understand something  that Peter Rabbit and the other little people of the Green Meadows and  the Green Forest learned almost as soon as they learned to walk,--that  if you don't want to be seen, you mustn't be heard. So he didn't  whistle as he felt like doing, and he tried not to make a bit of noise  as he followed an old cow-path towards a place where he knew the berries  grew thick and oh, so big, and all the time he kept his eyes wide open,  and he kept his ears open too.    That is how he happened to hear a little cry, a very faint little cry.  If he had been whistling, he wouldn't have heard it at all. He stopped  to listen. He never had heard a cry just like it before. At first he  couldn't make out just what it was or where it came from. But one thing  he was sure of, and that was that it was a cry of fright. He stood  perfectly still and listened with all his might. There it was  again--\"Help! Help! Help\"--and it was very faint and sounded terribly  frightened. He waited a minute or two, but heard nothing more. Then he  put down his pail and began a hurried look here, there, and everywhere.  He was sure that it had come from somewhere on the ground, so he peered  behind bushes and peeped behind logs and stones, and then just as he had  about given up hope of finding where it came from, he went around a  little turn in the old cow-path, and there right in front of him was  little Mr. Gartersnake, and what do you think he was doing? Well, I  don't like to tell you, but he was trying to swallow one of the children  of Stickytoes the Tree Toad. Of course Farmer Brown's Boy didn't let  him. He made little Mr. Gartersnake set Master Stickytoes free and held  Mr. Gartersnake until Master Stickytoes was safely out of reach.          XIX    BUSTER BEAR HAS A FINE TIME      Buster Bear was having the finest time he had had since he came down  from the Great Woods to live in the Green Forest. To be sure, he wasn't  in the Green Forest now, but he wasn't far from it. He was in the Old  Pasture, one edge of which touches one edge of the Green Forest. And  where do you think he was, in the Old Pasture? Why, right in the middle  of the biggest patch of the biggest blueberries he ever had seen in all  his life! Now if there is any one thing that Buster Bear had rather have  above another, it is all the berries he can eat, unless it be honey.  Nothing can quite equal honey in Buster's mind. But next to honey give  him berries. He isn't particular what kind of berries. Raspberries,  blackberries, or blueberries, either kind, will make him perfectly  happy.    \"Um-m-m, my, my, but these are good!\" he mumbled in his deep  grumbly-rumbly voice, as he sat on his haunches stripping off the  berries greedily. His little eyes twinkled with enjoyment, and he didn't  mind at all if now and then he got leaves, and some green berries in his  mouth with the big ripe berries. He didn't try to get them out. Oh, my,  no! He just chomped them all up together and patted his stomach from  sheer delight. Now Buster had reached the Old Pasture just as jolly,  round, red Mr. Sun had crept out of bed, and he had fully made up his  mind that he would be back in the Green Forest before Mr. Sun had  climbed very far up in the blue, blue sky. You see, big as he is and  strong as he is, Buster Bear is very shy and bashful, and he has no  desire to meet Farmer Brown, or Farmer Brown's boy, or any other of  those two-legged creatures called men. It seems funny but he actually is  afraid of them. And he had a feeling that he was a great deal more  likely to meet one of them in the Old Pasture than deep in the Green  Forest.    So when he started to look for berries, he made up his mind that he  would eat what he could in a great hurry and get back to the Green  Forest before Farmer Brown's boy was more than out of bed. But when he  found those berries he was so hungry that he forgot his"]]]
