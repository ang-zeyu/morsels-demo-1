As  to the reason why the figure has this member larger than is natural and  moves it, though it moves no other part of the body, about this there is  a sacred story told. Now I think that Melampus the son of Amytheon was  not without knowledge of these rites of sacrifice, but was acquainted  with them: for Melampus is he who first set forth to the Hellenes the  name of Dionysos and the manner of sacrifice and the procession of the  _phallos_. Strictly speaking indeed, he when he made it known did not  take in the whole, but those wise men who came after him made it known  more at large. Melampus then is he who taught of the _phallos_ which is  carried in procession for Dionysos, and from him the Hellenes learnt to  do that which they do. I say then that Melampus being a man of ability  contrived for himself an art of divination, and having learnt from Egypt  he taught the Hellenes many things, and among them those that concern  Dionysos, making changes in some few points of them: for I shall not say  that that which is done in worship of the god in Egypt came accidentally  to be the same with that which is done among the Hellenes, for then  these rites would have been in character with the Hellenic worship and  not lately brought in; nor certainly shall I say that the Egyptians took  from the Hellenes either this or any other customary observance: matters  concerning Dionysos from Cadmos the Tyrian and from those who came with  him from Phenicia to the land which we now call Boeotia.    Moreover the naming of almost all the gods has come to Hellas from  Egypt: for that it has come from the Barbarians I find by inquiry is  true, and I am of opinion that most probably it has come from Egypt,  because, except in the case of Poseidon and the Dioscuroi (in accordance  with that which I have said before), and also of Hera and Hestia and  Themis and the Charites and Nereids, the Egyptians say themselves: but  as for the gods whose names they profess that they do not know, these I  think received their naming from the Pelasgians, except Poiseidon;  but about this god the Hellenes learnt from the Libyans, for no people  except the Libyans have had the name of Poseidon from the first and have  paid honour to this god always. Nor, it may be added, have the Egyptians  any custom of worshipping heroes. These observances then, and others  besides these which I shall mention, the Hellenes have adopted from  the Egyptians; but to make, as they do the images of Hermes with  the _phallos_ they have learnt not from the Egyptians but from the  Pelasgians, the custom having been received by the Athenians first of  all the Hellenes and from these by the rest; for just at the time when  the Athenians were beginning to rank among the Hellenes, the Pelasgians  became dwellers with them in their land, and from this very cause it was  that they began to be counted as Hellenes. Whosoever has been initiated  in the mysteries of the Cabeiroi, which the Samothrakians perform having  received them from the Pelasgians, that man knows the meaning of my  speech; for these very Pelasgians who became dwellers with the Athenians  used to dwell before that time in Samothrake, and from them the  Samothrakians received their mysteries. So then the Athenians were the  first of the Hellenes who made the images of Hermes with the _phallos_,  having learnt from the Pelasgians; and the Pelasgians told a sacred  story about it, which is set forth in the mysteries in Samothrake. Now  the Pelasgians formerly were wont to make all their sacrifices calling  upon the gods in prayer, as I know from that which I heard at Dodona,  but they gave no title or name to any of them, for they had not yet  heard any, but they called them gods from some such notion as this,  that they had set in order all things and so had the distribution of  everything. Afterwards when much time had elapsed, they learnt from  Egypt the names of the gods, all except Dionysos, for his name they  learnt long afterwards; and after a time the Pelasgians consulted the  Oracle at Dodona about the names, for this prophetic seat is accounted  to be the most ancient of the Oracles which are among the Hellenes,  and at that time it was the only one. So when the Pelasgians asked the  Oracle at Dodona whether they should adopt the names which had come from  the Barbarians, the Oracle in reply bade them make use of the names.  From this time they sacrificed using the names of the gods, and from the  Pelasgians the Hellenes afterwards received them: but when the several  gods had their birth, or whether they all were from the beginning, and  of what form they are, they did not learn till yesterday, as it were, or  the day before: for Hesiod and Homer I suppose were four hundred years  before my time and not more, and these are they who made a theogony for  the Hellenes and gave the titles to the gods and distributed to them  honours and arts, and set forth their forms: but the poets who are said  to have been before these men were really in my opinion after them. Of  these things the first are said by the priestesses of Dodona, and the  latter things, those namely which have regard to Hesiod and Homer, by  myself.    As regards the Oracles both that among the Hellenes and that in Libya,  the Egyptians tell the following tale. The priests of the Theban Zeus  told me that two women in the service of the temple had been carried  away from Thebes by Phenicians, and that they had heard that one of them  had been sold to go into Libya and the other to the Hellenes; and these  women, they said, were they who first founded the prophetic seats among  the nations which have been named: and when I inquired whence they knew  so perfectly of this tale which they told, they said in reply that a  great search had been made by the priests after these women, and that  they had not been able to find them, but they had heard afterwards this  tale about them which they were telling. This I heard from the priests  at Thebes, and what follows is said by the prophetesses of Dodona. They  say that two black doves flew from Thebes in Egypt, and came one of them  to Libya and the other to their land. And this latter settled upon an  oak-tree and spoke with human voice, saying that it was necessary that  a prophetic seat of Zeus should be established in that place; and they  supposed that that was of the gods which was announced to them, and made  one accordingly: and the dove which went away to the Libyans, they say,  bade the Libyans make an Oracle of Ammon; and this also is of Zeus. The  priestesses of Dodona told me these things, of whom the eldest was named  Promeneia, the next after her Timarete, and the youngest Nicandra;  and the other people of Dodona who were engaged about the temple gave  accounts agreeing with theirs. I however have an opinion about the  matter as follows:--If the Phenicians did in truth carry away the  consecrated women and sold one of them into Libya and the other into  Hellas, I suppose that in the country now called Hellas, which was  formerly called Pelasgia, this woman was sold into the land of the  Thesprotians; and then being a slave there she set up a sanctuary of  Zeus under a real oak-tree; as indeed it was natural that being an  attendant of the sanctuary of Zeus at Thebes, she should there, in the  place to which she had come, have a memory of him; and after this, when  she got understanding of the Hellenic tongue, she established an Oracle,  and she reported, I suppose, that her sister had been sold in Libya by  the same Phenicians by whom she herself had been sold. Moreover, I think  that the women were called doves by the people of Dodona for the reason  that they were barbarians and because it seemed to them that they  uttered voice like birds; but after a time (they say) the dove spoke  with human voice, that is when the woman began to speak so that they  could understand; but so long as she spoke a Barbarian tongue she seemed  to them to be uttering voice like a bird: for if it had been really a  dove, how could it speak with human voice? And in saying that the  dove was black, they indicate that the woman was Egyptian. The ways of  delivering oracles too at Thebes in Egypt and at Dodona closely resemble  each other, as it happens, and also the method of divination by victims  has come from Egypt.    Moreover, it is true also that the Egyptians were the first of men who  made solemn assemblies and processions and approaches to the temples,  and from them the Hellenes have learnt them, and my evidence for this  is that the Egyptian celebrations of these have been held from a very  ancient time, whereas the Hellenic were introduced but lately. The  Egyptians hold their solemn assemblies not once in the year but often,  especially and with the greatest zeal and devotion at the city of  Bubastis for Artemis, and next at Busiris for Isis; for in this  last-named city there is a very great temple of Isis, and this city  stands in the middle of the Delta of Egypt; now Isis is in the tongue of  the Hellenes Demeter: thirdly, they have a solemn assembly at the city  of Sais for Athene, fourthly at Heliopolis for the Sun (Helios), fifthly  at the city of Buto in honour of Leto, and sixthly at the city of  Papremis for Ares. Now, when they are coming to the city of Bubastis  they do as follows:--they sail men and women together, and a great  multitude of each sex in every boat; and some of the women have rattles  and rattle with them, while some of the men play the flute during the  whole time of the voyage, and the rest, both women and men, sing and  clap their hands; and when as they sail they come opposite to any city  on the way they bring the boat to land, and some of the women continue  to do as I have said, others cry aloud and jeer at the women in that  city, some dance, and some stand up and pull up their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],[0,"Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#7)"],[1,"ceased, as those nearest became conscious of the  fact that their pursuit by the great beast had ceased.    Soon after passing the end of the Doctor's wall, the elephant, now fully  at liberty, found itself by the tall, well-clipped mingled  hawthorn-and-privet hedge that enclosed the lawn-like, verdant  cricket-field, at the far side of which there was a grand row of old  elms which brought back to the escaped animal memories of Indian forests  and pendant boughs covered with fresh green leaves that could be torn  down and eaten; and, stopping short in the rapid pace which it had  pursued, swinging its massive head from side to side, it once more  turned itself \"half-right,\" as if upon a pivot, stared at the tall green  hedge for a few moments, and then, curling its trunk right backwards  over its neck, it uttered another trumpeting note which was no longer  angry, but sounded cracked and partook of the nature of a squeak.  Then  it did not charge the hedge, but just walked through it; and as soon as  its great circular feet began to feel the soft, yielding grass into  which they sank, for the ground was moist, the great brute began to  twitch its tail in the most absurd way, squeak with delight, and indulge  in the most clumsily ridiculous gambol ever executed by monster ten feet  high.    It was for all the world such a dance, magnified, as a fat, chubby  little Shetland pony would display when, freed from bit, bridle, or  halter, it was turned out to grass.  And now, as the elephant began  careering right across the cricket-field in the direction of the row of  elms, there was a shout of dismay from the row occupying the forms; and,  headed by Mr Morris, a retreat was made to a place of safety, that  being represented by the doors opening on to the playground--Mr Morris,  the mathematical master, charged as he was with his long study of  Euclid, evidently considering it to be his duty for the benefit of his  pupils to describe a straight line.    But he was soon distanced by the boys, whose wind was much better.  The  last, as if he considered it his duty to protect the rear, was the  Doctor himself, looking exceedingly red in the face and breathing very  hard.  But, truth to tell, he--not being either a general, admiral, or  even captain of a vessel of war--was not influenced by any brave  intention to leave the field or vessel only after the last of his men.  The Doctor's proceedings were caused by inability to keep up.    But he was not the last.  The sight of an elephant cantering across  country, or in its customary shuffling gait, was nothing new to Singh  and Glyn.  Experience gained in more than one hunt, and in a land where  these mammoth-like creatures are beasts of burden, as well as perhaps a  feeling that if they did happen to be pursued youth and activity would  enable them to get out of the brute's way, caused the two boys to stand  fast alone upon the last form, thoroughly enjoying the acts of the  performer, and wondering what he would do next.    \"Oh, Glyn,\" cried Singh, clapping his hands as hard as he could, \"and I  was grumbling!  Why, this is a procession!  I haven't seen anything like  this since we left home.\"    \"No,\" panted Glyn, who was as excited as his companion.  \"Why, it's like  old Rajah Jamjar, as we used to call him, on the rampage.  Here come the  men,\" he continued.--\"Hi!  I say, the Doctor won't like you breaking  through his hedge,\" he shouted, though his words were not heard.--\"He's  broken a way for them, though.\"    \"Here,\" shouted Singh, with his hands to his mouth, \"you mustn't go  after that elephant with whips.  He's raging, and if you go near he'll  turn upon you perhaps, and kill you.\"    But the men could not hear his words, and, each with his big carter's  whip, they followed slowly across the field, unheeded by the elephant,  and evidently without the slightest intention of overtaking the  fugitive.    The great brute turned neither to the right nor left, but stopped as  soon as he reached the row of elms, beyond which were the garden and  grounds of the most important resident in Plymborough, a very wealthy  retired merchant, who took great pride in his estate, and whose orchard  annually displayed a vast abundance of red and gold temptations of the  kind beloved by boys in other counties as well as sunny Devon.    It was pleasant and shady beneath the elms, and a faintly heard grunt of  satisfaction came to the two boys' ears as they saw the great fugitive  reach up, twist its indiarubber-like trunk, and gather together a bunch  of twigs, which it snapped off, and then, reversing its elastic organ,  stood tucking them into its peculiarly moist mouth.    \"Oh, he's quiet and tame enough,\" said Glyn.    \"No, he isn't,\" cried Singh; \"he's in a fury.\"    \"But it's a regular tame one,\" said Glyn.  \"I dare say they might walk  up and drive it in now.  I'll go and help them if you will.\"    \"Well,\" said Singh, slowly and thoughtfully, \"I don't know.  It's a  strange elephant; he's been scared, and I saw as he passed that he was  in a temper; but I dare say we know as much about elephants as they do.\"    \"Yes, let's go.\"    But as they were speaking, and the elephant stood refreshing itself with  another bunch of green leaves, it appeared to catch sight of the group  of drivers, who, whip-armed, had now stopped together to consult in the  middle of the field, where they were being joined by a fat,  chuffy-looking little man, who was hurrying to them, hat in one hand,  yellow silk pocket-handkerchief in the other, with which he kept on  dabbing his very smooth and shiny white bald head.    The elephant was evidently watching, and had recognised this white shiny  head, for he raised his trunk and let fall the twigs, blew a defiant  blast upon his natural trumpet, and, wheeling round once more, did not  charge, but made a crashing sound as he walked right through the  park-palings which divided the two estates, where beneath the trees a  green hedge would not grow.    As the elephant disappeared in the next field, only a glimpse being  obtained of it through the one panel of the split oak fence, every one  seemed to recover his departed courage.  The men, now joined by the  bald-headed personage, who was really the proprietor of the great show,  began to follow the fugitive to the boundary of the Doctor's grounds.    The two boys sprang off the form and ran to join them, while away to the  right, bodies began to appear from the Doctor's premises where heads  only had been seen; and chief amongst these was Mr Morris, the  mathematical master, who, influenced by his conscience, and reminded of  the fact that he had gone on drawing that line very straight till he  reached the shelter of the house, an act which he felt must have rather  lowered his reputation for bravery amongst the boys, now came out a few  yards into the playground; and, as the boys began to gather round him,  he moved on again a little way, making a point of keeping himself  nearest to the danger, if any danger there were, but not going so far as  to preclude an easy retreat.    Now, in naval law, during an action there is a tradition that the safest  place for a sailor, and where he is least likely to be hit, is the hole  through which a cannon-ball or shell has crashed into the ship.  Possibly, being a mathematician, Mr Morris may have calculated the  possibilities against the elephant that had marched through that piece  of fence coming back through it again.  And so it was that as the  Doctor's grounds were clear, the enemy having departed, he followed  farther and farther out into the cricket-field, and then headed a  cluster of the first-form boys who, unknown to the Doctor, were making  for the broken fence.  The fact that they soon saw the elephant's  pursuers pass through, and with them the bald-headed man, with their  fellow-pupils Glyn and Singh on each side leading, had doubtless  something to do with the forward movement.    Slegge, too, was the biggest and loudest there.  He was looking very  white, almost as white as Ramball's bald head, but he said it was all a  \"jolly lark;\" and then for want of something else to say to express how  he was enjoying himself, he made the same remark again, and then laughed  aloud.  But it was the same sort of laugh as would be uttered by the  victim of a practical joke who has suddenly sat down upon a tin-tack or  a pin.    Mr Morris, too, grew braver and braver, and he smiled a ghastly smile  which rather distorted his features as he addressed his pupils.    \"Come along, boys,\" he said.  \"This is a holiday indeed.  We are going  to search for the unknown quantity.  An elephant hunt in the Doctor's  grounds!  It is quite a novelty.\"    \"But it isn't in the Doctor's grounds now, sir,\" said Burney.    This was meant to be facetious; but it turned Mr Morris's smile into a  glare, and brought down upon the boy's head a rebuke from Slegge.    \"Here, don't you be so fast, youngster,\" cried the latter, with the  wisdom of a sage in his stern look.  \"Just remember whom you are talking  to, if you please.\"  Then, to curry favour with the master, \"I beg your  pardon, Mr Morris, would this be an Indian or an African elephant?\"    \"Well, Mr Slegge,\" said the mathematical master, with his ghastly smile  coming back, \"now if this were a question of a surd in a compound  equation I should be happy to tell you; but as soon as the captive is  taken again, and the `lark,' as you call it, is over, I should recommend  you to ask Mr Rampson.  He'll tell you, and give you some information  as well respecting the Carthaginian army and the elephants with their  towers that they marched against the Romans.  My mathematical studies  take up all my brain-power, and I never venture upon another master's  ground.  By the way, who are those boys that we just saw walk through  that fence with the show-people?  Trespassers, of course.  We don't want  any of the town boys"]]]
