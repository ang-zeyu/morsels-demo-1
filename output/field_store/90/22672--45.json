Dying, he cursed me and my crew, and doomed us not to die and not to  live, until we should lay our heads upon the earth.    \"The Dervise expired, and we cast him overboard, laughing at his  menaces; that same night, however, were his words fulfilled. One  portion of my crew rose against me; with terrible courage the struggle  continued, until my supporters fell, and I myself was nailed to the  mast. The mutineers, however, also sank under their wounds, and soon  my ship was but one vast grave. My eyes also closed, my breath  stopped--I thought I was dying. But it was only a torpor which held me  chained: the following night, at the same hour in which we had cast  the Dervise into the sea, I awoke, together with all my comrades;  life returned, but we could do and say nothing but what had been done  and said on that fatal night. Thus we sailed for fifty years, neither  living nor dying, for how could we reach the land? With mad joy we  ever dashed along, with full sails, before the storm, for we hoped at  last to be wrecked upon some cliff, and to compose our weary heads to  rest upon the bottom of the sea; but in this we never succeeded. Now I  shall die! Once again, unknown preserver, accept my thanks, and if  treasures can reward thee, then take my ship in token of my  gratitude.\"    With these words the Captain let his head drop, and expired. Like his  companions, he immediately fell to dust. We collected this in a little  vessel, and buried it on the shore: and I took workmen from the city  to put the ship in good condition. After I had exchanged, with great  advantage, the wares I had on board for others, I hired a crew, richly  rewarded my friend Muley, and set sail for my fatherland. I took a  circuitous route, in the course of which I landed at several islands  and countries, to bring my goods to market. The Prophet blessed my  undertaking. After several years I ran into Balsora, twice as rich as  the dying Captain had made me. My fellow-citizens were amazed at my  wealth and good fortune, and would believe nothing else but that I had  found the diamond-valley of the far-famed traveller Sinbad. I left  them to their belief; henceforth must the young folks of Balsora, when  they have scarcely arrived at their eighteenth year, go forth into the  world, like me, to seek their fortunes. I, however, live in peace and  tranquillity, and every five years make a journey to Mecca, to thank  the Lord for his protection, in that holy place, and to entreat for  the Captain and his crew, that He will admit them into Paradise.    [Illustration]           *       *       *       *       *    The march of the Caravan proceeded the next day without hinderance,  and when they halted, Selim the Stranger began thus to speak to Muley,  the youngest of the merchants:    \"You are, indeed, the youngest of us, nevertheless you are always in  fine spirits, and, to a certainty, know for us, some right merry  story. Out with it then, that it may refresh us after the heat of the  day.\"    \"I might easily tell you something,\" answered Muley, \"which would  amuse you, nevertheless modesty becomes youth in all things; therefore  must my older companions have the precedence. Zaleukos is ever so  grave and reserved; should not he tell us what has made his life so  serious? Perhaps we could assuage his grief, if such he have; for  gladly would we serve a brother, even if he belong to another creed.\"    The person alluded to was a Grecian merchant of middle age, handsome  and strongly built, but very serious. Although he was an unbeliever,  (that is, no Mussulman,) still his companions were much attached to  him, for his whole conduct had inspired them with respect and  confidence. He had only one hand, and some of his companions  conjectured that, perhaps, this loss gave so grave a tone to his  character. Zaleukos thus answered Muley's friendly request:    \"I am much honored by your confidence: grief have I none, at least  none from which, even with your best wishes, you can relieve me.  Nevertheless, since Muley appears to blame me for my seriousness, I  will relate to you something which will justify me when I am more  grave than others. You see that I have lost my left hand; this came  not to me at my birth, but I lost it in the most unhappy days of my  life. Whether I bear the fault thereof, whether I am wrong to be more  serious than my condition in life would seem to make me, you must  decide, when I have told you the STORY OF THE HEWN-OFF HAND.\"          [Illustration]    THE STORY OF THE HEWN OFF HAND.      I was born in Constantinople; my father was a Dragoman of the Ottoman  Porte, and carried on, besides, a tolerably lucrative trade in  essences and silk goods. He gave me a good education, since he partly  superintended it himself, and partly had me instructed by one of our  priests. At first, he intended that I should one day take charge of  his business: but since I displayed greater capacity than he expected,  with the advice of his friends, he resolved that I should study  medicine; for a physician, if he only knows more than a common quack,  can make his fortune in Constantinople.    Many Frenchmen were in the habit of coming to our house, and one of  them prevailed upon my father to let me go to the city of Paris, in  his fatherland, where one could learn the profession gratuitously, and  with the best advantages: he himself would take me with him, at his  own expense, when he returned. My father, who in his youth had also  been a traveller, consented, and the Frenchman told me to hold myself  in readiness in three months. I was beside myself with delight to see  foreign lands, and could not wait for the moment in which we should  embark. At last the stranger had finished his business, and was ready  to start.    On the evening preceding our voyage, my father conducted me into his  sleeping apartment; there I saw fine garments and weapons lying on the  table; but what most attracted my eye was a large pile of gold, for I  had never before seen so much together. My father embraced me, and  said,    \"See, my son, I have provided thee with garments for thy journey.  These weapons are thine; they are those which thy grandfather hung  upon me, when I went forth into foreign lands. I know thou canst wield  them; but use them not, unless thou art attacked; then, however, lay  on with right good-will. My wealth is not great; see! I have divided  it into three parts: one is thine; one shall be for my support, and  spare money in case of necessity; the third shall be sacred and  untouched by me, it may serve thee in the hour of need.\" Thus spoke my  old father, while tears hung in his eyes, perhaps from a presentiment,  for I have never seen him since.    Our voyage was favorable; we soon reached the land of the Franks, and  six days' journey brought us to the large city, Paris. Here my French  friend hired me a room, and advised me to be prudent in spending my  money, which amounted to two thousand thalers. In this city I lived  three years, and learned all that a well-educated physician should  know. I would be speaking falsely, however, if I said that I was very  happy, for the customs of the people pleased me not; moreover, I had  but few good friends among them, but these were young men of  nobility.    The longing after my native land at length became irresistible; during  the whole time I had heard nothing from my father, and I therefore  seized a favorable opportunity to return home. There was going an  embassy from France to the Supreme Porte: I agreed to join the train  of the ambassador as surgeon, and soon arrived once more at Stamboul.    My father's dwelling, however, I found closed, and the neighbors,  astonished at seeing me, said that my father had been dead for two  months. The priest, who had instructed me in youth, brought me the  key. Alone and forsaken, I entered the desolate house. I found all as  my father had left it; but the gold which he promised to leave to me,  was missing. I inquired of the priest respecting it, and he bowed and  said:    \"Your father died like a holy man, for he left his gold to the  Church!\"    This was incomprehensible to me; nevertheless, what could I do? I had  no proofs against the priest, and could only congratulate myself that  he had not also looked upon the house, and wares of my father, in the  light of a legacy. This was the first misfortune that met me; but after  this came one upon another. My reputation as a physician would not  extend itself, because I was ashamed to play the quack; above all, I  missed the recommendation of my father, who had introduced me to the  richest and most respectable families; but now they thought no more of  the poor Zaleukos. Moreover, the wares of my father found no sale, for  his customers had been scattered at his death, and new ones came only  after a long time. One day, as I was reflecting sorrowfully upon my  situation, it occurred to me that in France I had often seen countrymen  of mine, who travelled through the land, and exposed their goods at the  market-places of the cities: I recollected that people gladly purchased  of them, because they came from foreign lands; and that by such a  trade, one could make a hundred-fold. My resolution was forthwith  taken; I sold my paternal dwelling, gave a portion of the money  obtained thereby to a tried friend to preserve for me, and with the  remainder purchased such articles as were rare in France,--shawls,  silken goods, ointments, and oils; for these I hired a place upon a  vessel, and thus began my second voyage to France. It appeared as if  fortune became favorable to me, the moment I had the Straits of the  Dardanelles upon my back. Our voyage was short and prosperous. I  travelled through the cities of France, large and small, and found, in  all, ready purchasers for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24598"],[0,"A Modern History, From the Time of Luther to the Fall of Napoleon (#7)"],[1,"olastics, and even from those  celebrated words of Christ to Peter--\"Thou art Peter, and on this rock  will I build my church,\" &c. Luther took higher and bolder ground,  denied the infallibility of councils, and appealed to Scripture as the  ultimate authority. Eck had probably the advantage over his  antagonist, so far as dialectics were concerned, being a more able  disputant; but Luther set at defiance mere scholastic logic, and  appealed to an authority which dialectics could not reach. The victory  was claimed by both parties; but the result was, that Luther no longer  acknowledged the authority of the Roman church, and acknowledged none  but the Scriptures.    [Sidenote: The Rights of Private Judgment.]    The Leipsic disputation was the grand intellectual contest of the  Reformation, and developed its great idea--the only great principle,  around which all sects and parties among the Protestants rally. This  is the idea, that _the Scriptures are the only ultimate grounds of  authority in religion, and that, moreover, every man has a right to  interpret them for himself_. The rights of private judgment--that  religion is a matter between the individual soul and God, and that  every man is answerable to his own conscience alone how he interprets  Scripture--these constitute the great Protestant platform. Different  sects have different views respecting justification, but all profess  to trace them to the Scriptures. Luther's views were similar to those  of St. Augustine--that \"man could be justified by faith alone,\" which  was _his_ great theological doctrine--a doctrine adopted by many who  never left the communion of the Church of Rome, before and since his  day, and a doctrine which characterized the early reformers, Zwingle,  Calvin, Knox, Cranmer, and the Puritans generally. It is as absurd to  say that Luther's animating principle in religion was not this  doctrine, as it is unphilosophical to make the reformation consist  merely in its recognition. After Luther's convictions were settled on  this point, and he had generally and openly declared them, the main  contest of his life was against the papacy, which he viewed as the  predicted Antichrist--the \"scarlet mother of abominations.\" It is not  the object of the writer of this History to defend or oppose Luther's  views, or argue any cause whatever, but simply to place facts in their  true light, which is, to state them candidly.    Although the Leipsic controversy brought out the great principle of  the Reformation, Luther's views, both respecting the true doctrines  and polity of the church, were not, on all points, yet developed, and  were only gradually unfolded, as he gained knowledge and light. It was  no trifling matter, even to deny the supremacy of the Roman church in  matters of faith. He was thus placed in the position of Huss and  Jerome, and other reformers, who had been destroyed, with scarcely an  exception. He thus was brought in direct conflict with the pope, with  the great dignitaries of the church, with the universities, and with  the whole scholastic literature. He had to expect the violent  opposition and vengeance of the pope, of the monks, of the great  ecclesiastical dignitaries, of the most distinguished scholars, and of  those secular princes who were friendly to Rome. He had none to  protect him but a prince of the empire, powerful, indeed, and wise,  but old and wavering. There were but few to uphold and defend him--the  satirical Erasmus, who was called a second Lucian, the feeble  Staupitz, the fanatical Carlstadt, and the inexperienced Melancthon.  The worldly-minded, the learned, the powerful, and the conservative  classes were his natural enemies. But he had reason and Scripture on  his side, and he appealed to their great and final verdict. He had  singular faith in the power of truth, and the gracious protection of  God Almighty. Reposing on the greatness of his cause, and the  providence of the omnipotent Protector, he was ready to defy all the  arts, and theories, and malice of man. His weapon was truth. For truth  he fought, and for truth he was ready to die. The sophistries of the  schools he despised; they had distorted and mystified the truth. And  he knew them well, for he had been trained in the severest dialectics  of his time, and, though he despised them, he knew how to use them.  The simple word of God, directed to the reason and conscience of men,  seemed alone worthy of his regard.    [Sidenote: Luther's Elements of Greatness.]    But, beside Scripture and unperverted reason, he had another element  of power. He was master of the sympathies and passions of the people.  His father was a toiling miner. His grandfather was a peasant. He had  been trained to penury; he had associated with the poor; he was a man  of the people; he was their natural friend. He saw and lamented their  burdens, and rose up for their deliverance. And the people  distinguished their true friend, from their false friends. They saw  the sincerity, earnestness, and labors of the new apostle of liberty,  and believed in him, and made an idol of him. They would protect him,  and honor him, and obey him, and believe what he taught them, for he  was their friend, whom God had raised up to take off their burdens,  and point a way to heaven, without the intercession of priests, or  indulgences, or penance. Their friend was to expose the corruptions of  the clergy, and to give battle to the great arch enemy who built St.  Peter's Church from their hard-earned pittances. A spirit from heaven  enlightened those to whom Luther preached, and they rallied around his  standard, and swore never to separate, until the great enemies of the  poor and the oppressed were rendered powerless. And their sympathies  were needed, and best services, too; for the great man of the age--the  incarnated spirit of liberty--was in danger.    [Sidenote: Excommunication of Luther.]    The pope, hitherto mild, persuasive, and undecided, now arose in the  majesty of his mighty name, and, as the successor of St. Peter, hurled  those weapons which had been thunderbolts in the hands of the  Gregories and the Innocents. From his papal throne, and with all the  solemnity of God's appointed vicegerent, he denounced the daring monk  of Wittemberg, and sentenced him to the wrath of God, and to the  penalty of eternal fire. Luther was excommunicated by a papal bull,  and his writings were condemned as heretical and damnable.    This was a dreadful sentence. Few had ever resisted it successfully,  even monarchs themselves. Excommunication was still a fearful weapon,  and used only in desperate circumstances. It was used only as the last  resort; for frequency would destroy its power. In the middle ages,  this weapon was omnipotent; and the middle ages had but just passed  away. No one could stand before that awful anathema which consigned  him to the wrath of incensed and implacable Deity. Much as some  professed to despise the sentence, still, when inflicted, it could not  be borne, especially if accompanied with an interdict. Children were  left unburied. The churches were closed. The rites of religion were  suspended. A funereal shade was spread over society. The fears of hell  haunted every imagination. No reason was strong enough to resist the  sentence. No arm was sufficiently powerful to remove the curse. It  hung over a guilty land. It doomed the unhappy offender, who was  cursed, wherever he went, and in whatever work he was engaged.    But Luther was strong enough to resist it, and to despise it. He saw  it was an imposition, which only barbarous and ignorant ages had  permitted. Moreover, he perceived that there was now no alternative  but victory or death; that, in the great contest in which he was  engaged, retreat was infamy. Nor did he wish to retreat. He was  fighting for oppressed humanity, and death even, in such a cause, was  glory. He understood fully the nature and the consequence of the  struggle. He perceived the greatness of the odds against him, in a  worldly point of view. No man but a Luther would have been equal to  it; no man, before him, ever had successfully rebelled against the  pope. It is only in view of this circumstance, that his intrepidity  can be appreciated.    What did the Saxon monk do, when the papal bull was published? He  assembled the professors and students of the university, declared his  solemn protest against the pope as Antichrist, and marched in  procession to the gates of the Castle of Wittemberg, and there made a  bonfire, and cast into it the bull which condemned him, the canon law,  and some writings of the schoolmen, and then reentered the city,  breathing defiance against the whole power of the pope, glowing in the  consciousness that the battle had commenced, to last as long as life,  and perfectly secure that the victory would finally be on the side of  truth. This was in 1520, on the 10th of December.    The attention of the whole nation was necessarily drawn to this open  resistance; and the sympathy of the free thinking, the earnest, and  the religious, was expressed for him. Never was popular interest more  absorbing, in respect to his opinions, his fortunes, and his fate. The  spirit of innovation became contagious, and pervaded the German mind.  It demanded the serious attention of the emperor himself.    [Sidenote: The Diet of Worms.]    A great Diet of the empire was convened at Worms, and thither Luther  was summoned by the temporal power. He had a safe-conduct, which even  so powerful a prince as Charles V. durst not violate. In April, 1521,  the reformer appeared before the collected dignitaries of the German  empire, both spiritual and temporal, and was called upon to recant his  opinions as heretical in the eyes of the church, and dangerous to the  peace of the empire. Before the most august assembly in the world,  without a trace of embarrassment, he made his defence, and refused to  recant. \"Unle"]]]
