The dogs, trained to hunt  the kangaroo, were at first serviceable to the natives, but they often  increased the destruction by their spontaneous ravening. It is observed  by a writer of 1827, that forty or fifty would be found within short  distances, run down by the dogs, and left to rot.    Thus the food, on which the people depended for subsistence, was  diminished, and the temptation to rob the settlers was regularly  augmented at every return. Sir George Arthur, in his letter to the  Secretary of State in 1828, notices this topic as a complaint of the  natives against the intrusion of the whites, and seems to admit its  truth; but three years after, he affirms that game was still abundant in  the districts appointed for the tribes. It is, however, to be observed,  that he wrote when the blacks, as a people, were dead; and when the high  value of labor had withdrawn many from the chase; and that he implies a  local, rather than a pervading abundance. As the natives passed through  the settled districts to the sea shore, if numerous, their requirements  would be great; but, by scattering themselves abroad, to obtain a  sufficiency, their dangers would increase, and every evening they would  muster fewer than in the morning.[11]    Among the causes of enmity, referred to by writers of every period, the  abduction of the women by sealers and others, is noticed the earliest,  and continued to the last. The sealers were, chiefly, either convicts  whose sentences had expired, or such as contrived to escape. In the  islands of the Straits, they indulged the boundless license of their  passions, blending the professions of the petty pirate and the  fisherman. A chain of rocks enabled them to rove to a considerable  distance, picking up the refuse of the sea, and feeding on the aquatic  birds which frequented the islets in great abundance. Many, however,  perished, with the frail boats to which they committed their lives.  Their first stage was known as \"Clarke's Island;\" from thence they made  \"Preservation Island:\" a succession of rocks formed land marks in their  course to New Holland, from which many found their way to Kangaroo  Island, the Ultima Thule of their geography. In these places, they  engaged in sealing; the produce of which they sold to the small craft  trading among them, for guns, spirits, and tobacco. When the season was  over, they retired to the interior, and passed their days in alternate  slumber and intoxication.    So secure were some of these retreats, that they justified the  apprehension, that formidable pirates would be trained up in their  lawless and licentious communities. They were perpetually disturbed by  violence. One old man spent thirteen years on an island, alone. He  cultivated a plot of ground, and sold the produce to the boats which  floated about. Several times robbed of his crops and clothing, by these  contemptible spoilers, he, at last, was compelled to renounce his rude  independence. In King's Island, families sat down; but Colonel Arthur,  sensible of the great danger of these associations, sent the harbour  master to the Straits, who arrested absconders, and released native  women from slavery.    By these men, the black women and female children were captured in  excursions to this island, and were liable to the ill-treatment, which  might be expected from men who regarded them with passion and contempt.  They were employed as slaves on some islands, to strip the mutton bird,  and in whatever irksome labor was within their capacity. It is said that  one man (Harrison), had fourteen women in his service, whom he flogged  with military severity, and some of whom he put to death.    Boatswain, an aged woman, stolen in her youth, related the manner of her  abduction. She was induced to enter a boat, without suspicion of the  design, when her captors rowed away, and confined her on an island in  the Straits. She told her treatment, in broken English and expressive  pantomime; first spreading forth her hands, as if fastened to the wall;  then, with loud cries, gradually becoming fainter, she fell down into a  pretended swoon: thus describing the mode and severity of her torture.    These men acquired an extraordinary dominion over the fears of the  women, sufficient to induce them to dissemble in the presence of  strangers. Backhouse relates, that two girls, Jumbo and Jackey,  pretended, while in the company of their masters, either by silence, or  feigned anger, to resent the proposal to take them away; but when they  were assured that their liberty would be protected, they embraced it  with joy.    Jeffreys, whose narrative is tinged with romance, depicts the fondness  and contentment of the women in lively colors. Glad to escape the  tyranny of their countrymen, they displayed to these amiable white men,  warm, though jealous, affection;--whose occasional absence they  regretted, and for whose speedy return they invoked some imaginary deity  in plaintive melodies! It is not improbable, that they were sensible of  kindness, but it is very certain that this was not their ordinary lot.  Unanimous testimony permits no doubt that they experienced the severity,  which men of low intellect, and of fierce and capricious passions,  inflict on women of an inferior race.    The sealers, when they came to the main land, rarely brought their  captives: they were in danger of losing them. Their fickleness or  revenge, was sometimes fatal: in 1824, a party, engaged in an expedition  to entice the girls of a tribe, took with them one who had a half-caste  infant, and sent her on shore as a decoy. She returned, bringing  promises from her countrywomen to appear the following day; but at that  time the blacks descended in great force, and all the adventurers,  except one, were slain.    The sealers, by the names they gave the women, which were rarely  feminine, and were sometimes ludicrously absurd, indicated the notions  which prevailed. However slight their apparent importance, it has been  justly observed, they betray the low civilisation of the persons who  invented, and the degraded condition of those who bore them.    The intercourse of the stockmen was generally confined to the periods of  migration: sometimes with the connivance, at others, the express consent  of the men; but the detention was often compulsory. Dr. Ross found a  stock-keeper seated on a fallen tree, exhausted with hunger. He had  chained a woman to a log, \"to tame her;\" but she escaped, with his only  shirt, which he had bestowed in his fondness. For five hours he had  pursued her, catching glimpses of his shirt through the breaks of the  forest: at last, this signal disappeared; and having lost his way for  two days, he was in danger of starvation.    Such were the various causes, which combined first to alarm, and then to  goad into madness, this unhappy people. They were troublesome, and were  repelled. Wantonly wounded and shot down, they retaliated. Fresh wrongs  produced their kind: at length, every white man was a _guerilla_, and  every black an assassin. The original temper of both parties was  changed. Dread detestation and treachery embittered every mind: even the  humane yielded to the general sentiment. It became a question, which  race should perish, and every man's verdict was in favor of his own.    From this, however, it is not to be inferred, that the natives were  originally treacherous and cruel. It was stated by the Aborigines'  Committee, in the middle of the conflict, that such dispositions were  the substratum of their character, which, though disguised, only waited  for time and opportunity. The colonists in general, at last, believed  them to delight in blood, by an innate cruelty of temper--to find  pleasure in the terrors they excited, and the convulsive agonies of the  dying; but the records of mankind are full of such moral  transformations. The Indians of America, we are informed by Dr. Dwight,  became corrupt, to a degree \"enormous and dreadful: full of malice,  cruelty, and murders.\" But he himself, elsewhere remarks, that within  his observation white men, commonly sober, moral, and orderly, on  joining a mob, lost every one of these qualities; and, in a few hours of  excitement, exhibited more vice than he had witnessed for years. The  causes of degeneracy are not examined, when its mischief is suffered.  Sir George Arthur, in his despatches, asserted that the natives were,  and had been, \"a most treacherous race,\"--a view, which the Committee  adopted: these opinions were afterwards greatly modified; nor would it  be just to admit their truth, without stronger evidence than history  affords. Among the aborigines, some were distinguished for ferocity:  such was a woman who led on the Big River tribe, and who was called by  Mr. Robinson, the \"Amazon.\" A few were guilty of the crimes imputed to  the race: and who were often their oppressors, rather than their  avengers.    Though individuals, undoubtedly, displayed the vices imputed, who will  condemn the natural disposition of a people for actions committed at  lone intervals, by solitary assassins and marauders? The English alone  could preserve a record of the past, and after a careful examination no  other conclusion is possible, than that whoever continued acts of  ferocity and cruelty, the impulse and the example were European.    Dr. Ross, arriving in 1822, passed into the interior, and settled on a  farm. He was soon visited by the natives, whom he entertained with the  consideration due to their ignorance and their rights. They had kindled  their fires in perilous contiguity, and the flames threatened to destroy  his crops. He pointed out his danger, and they instantly combined to  extinguish the flame, and transferred their temporary resting place to a  spot, from which no harm could be communicated. Dr. Ross stood by, and  watched their cookery, and they offered him a part of their food: he  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22885"],[0,"Hindu Gods And Heroes (#7)"],[1," this period to expound the rules and mystic  significance of the Brahmanic ceremonies, give us varying accounts of  his origin, some of them saying that he arose through one or more  intermediate stages from non-existence (TB. II. ii. 9, 1-10, SB. VI.  i. 1, 1-5), others deriving him indirectly from the primitive waters  (SB. XI. i. 6, 1), others tracing his origin back to the still more  impersonal and abstract Brahma (Samav. B. I. 1-3, Gop. B. I. i. 4).  All these are attempts to express in the form of myth the idea of an  impersonal Principle of Creation as arising from a still more abstract  first principle. We have seen the poets of the Rig-veda gradually  moving towards the idea of a unity of godhead; in Prajapati this goal  is attained, but unfortunately it is attained by sacrificing almost  all that is truly divine in godhead. The conception of Prajapati that  we find in the Brahmanas is also expressed in some of the latest hymns  of the Rig-veda. Among these is the famous Purusha-sukta (RV. X. 90),  which throws a peculiar light on the character of Prajapati. It is in  praise of a primitive Purusha or Man, who is, of course, the same as  Prajapati; in some mysterious manner this Purusha is sacrificed, and  from the various parts of his body arise the various parts of the  world. The idea conveyed by this is that the universe came into  existence by the operation of the mystic laws revealed in the  Brahmanic rituals, and is maintained in its natural order by the same  means. The Brahmanas do not indeed often assert on their own authority  that Prajapati was himself sacrificed in order to produce the world,  and in fact they usually give other accounts of the creation; but as  their authors live in a rarefied atmosphere of mystical allegory in  which fact and fancy are completely confused with one another and  consistency ceases to have any meaning, none of them would have  difficulty in accepting the Rigvedic statement that he was sacrificed.  Hence they tell us on the one hand that Prajapati has created the  world from a blind will for generation or increase, producing from  each of his limbs some class of beings corresponding to it (e.g. MS.  IV. vi. 3), or copulating with the earth, atmosphere, sky, and speech  (SB. VI. i. 2, 1), or that he brought it into existence indirectly by  entering with the Triple Science or mystic lore of the three Vedas  into the primeval waters and thence forming an egg from which was  hatched the personal Demiurge Brahma, who actually created the world  (SB. VI. i. 1, 10); and on the other hand they relate that he created  sacrifice and performed it, making of himself a victim in order that  the gods, his offspring, might perform the rites for their own  benefit, forming an image of himself to be the sacrifice, by which he  redeemed himself from the gods (SB. XI. i. 8, 2-4; cf. AB. VII. 19,  KB. XIII. 1, SB. III. ii. 1, 11), and that after creation he ascended  to heaven (SB. X. ii. 2, 1). The thought that lies underneath these  bewildering flights of fancy is one of mystic pantheism: all created  existence has arisen by emanation from the one Creative Principle,  Prajapati, and in essence is one with Prajapati; Prajapati is an  impersonal being, a creative force, in which are embodied the laws of  Brahmanic ritual, which acts only in these laws, and which is above  the moral influences that affect humanity; and the whole of created  nature, animate and inanimate, is controlled in every process of its  being by these laws, and by the priest who possesses the knowledge of  them. Thus there lies a profound significance in the title of \"gods on  earth\" which the Brahmans have assumed.    When we speak of sacrifice in India, we must clear our minds of the  ideas which we have formed from reading the Bible. The Mosaic  conception of sacrifice was that of a religious ceremony denoting a  moral relation between a personal God and His worshippers: in the  sin-offerings and trespass-offerings was symbolised a reconciliation  between man and his God who was angered by man's conscious or  unconscious breach of the laws which had been imposed upon him for  his spiritual welfare, while meat-offerings and peace-offerings  typified the worshipper's sense of gratitude for the Divine love and  wisdom that guarded him. Of such relations there is to be found in the  Brahmanas no trace. If we may use a modern figure of speech, they  conceive the universe of gods, men, and lower creatures as a single  immense electric battery, and the sacrifice as a process of charging  this battery with ever fresh electricity. The sacrifice is a process,  at once material and mystic, which preserves the order of nature as  established by the prototypic sacrifice performed by Prajapati. The  gods became divine and immortal through sacrifice (TS. VI. iii. 4, 7,  VI. iii. 10, 2, VII. iv. 2, 1, SB. I. vi. 2, 1, MS. III. ix. 4, AB.  VI. i. 1, etc.); and they live on the gifts of earth, as mankind lives  on the gifts of heaven (TS. III. ii. 9, 7, SB. I. ii. 5, 24). The  sacrifice is thus the life-principle, the soul, of all gods and all  beings (SB. VIII. vi. 1, 10, IX. iii. 2, 7, XIV. iii. 2, 1); or, what  amounts to the same thing, the Triple Science or the knowledge of the  ceremonies of the Three Vedas is their essence (SB. X. iv. 2, 21). As  Prajapati created the primeval sacrifice, and as the gods by following  this rule obtained their divinity, so man should seek to follow their  example and by means of sacrifice rise to godhead and immortality. As  one Brahmana puts it, the sacrifice leads the way to heaven; it is  followed by the _dakshina_, or fee paid by the sacrificer to the  sacrificant priests, which of course materially strengthens the  efficacy of the sacrifice; and third comes the sacrificer, holding  fast to the _dakshina_. This ascent of heaven is symbolised in the  ceremony called _durohana_, or \"hard mounting\" (AB. IV. 20, 21, KB.  XXV. 7), and it is ensured by the rite of _diksha_, or consecration,  in which the sacrificer is symbolically represented as passing through  a new conception, gestation, and birth, by which he is supposed to  obtain two bodies. One of these bodies is immortal and spiritual; the  other is mortal and material, and is assigned as a victim to all the  gods. He then ransoms his material body from the obligation of being  sacrificed, as did Prajapati, and thus ranks literally as a \"god on  earth,\" with the certainty of becoming in due course a god in heaven.    When the student on reading the Brahmanas finds them full of  interminable ceremonial rules with equally interminable commentaries  interpreting them by wildest analogies as symbolical of details of  myths or of laws of nature and hence as conferring mystic powers,  besides all kinds of myths, some forcibly dragged into the  interpretation of the ritual because of some imaginary point of  resemblance, others invented or recast on purpose to justify some  detail of ceremony, and when moreover he observes that many of these  myths and some of the rites are brutally and filthily obscene, and  that hardly any of them show the least moral feeling, he may be  excused for thinking the Brahmanas to be the work of madmen. But there  is some method in their madness. However strangely they may express  them, they have definite and strictly logical ideas about the  sacrificial ritual and its cosmic function. It is more difficult to  defend them against the charge of want of morality. It must be  admitted that their supreme Being, Prajapati, is in the main lines of  his character utterly impersonal, and where incidentally he shows any  human feelings they are as a rule far from creditable to him. He  created the universe from mechanical instinct or blind desire, and  committed or tried to commit incest with his daughter (the accounts  are various). He has begotten both the gods and the demons, _devas_  and _asuras_, who are constantly at war with one another. The gods,  who are embodiments of \"truth\" (that is to say, correct knowledge of  the law of ritual), have been often in great danger of being  overwhelmed by the demons, who embody \"untruth,\" and they have been  saved by Prajapati; but he has done this not from any sense of right,  but merely from blind will or favour, for he can hardly distinguish  one party from the other. The gods themselves, in spite of being of  \"truth,\" are sadly frail. Dozens of myths charge them with falsehood,  hatred, lust, greed, and jealousy, and only the stress of the danger  threatening them from their adversaries the demons has induced them to  organise themselves into an ordered kingdom under the sovereignty of  Indra, who has been anointed by Prajapati. True, many of the offensive  features in this mythology and ritual are survivals from a very  ancient past, a pre-historic time in which morals were conspicuously  absent from religion; the priesthood has forgotten very little, and as  a rule has only added new rituals and new interpretations to this  legacy from the days of old. Nevertheless it must be confessed that  there is a tone of ritualistic professionalism in the Brahmanas that  is unpleasing; the priesthood are consciously superior to nature, God,  and morals by virtue of their \"Triple Science,\" and they constantly  emphasise this claim. It is difficult for us to realise that these are  the same men who have created the Brahmanic culture of India, which,  however we may criticise it from the Western point of view, is  essentially a gentle life, a field in which moral feeling and  intellectual effort have born abundance of goodly fruit. Yet if we  look more closely we shall see that even these ritualists, besotted as  they may seem to be with their orgies of priestcraft, are not wholly  untouched by the better spirit of their race. Extremes of sanctity,  whether it be ritualistic or anti-ritualistic sanctity, always tend in  India--and in other countries as well--to produce"]]]
