They treated him well, and he made known to them that he was going back  to his village, his friends and people, whereupon the two white-headed  old men very heartily wished him a good journey and abundance of  comfort in seeing his friends once more. They even arose, old and infirm  as they were, and tottering with exceeding difficulty to the door, were  at great pains to point out to him the exact course he should take; and  they called his attention to the circumstance that it was much shorter  and more direct than he would have taken himself. Ah! what merry  deceivers were these two old men with very white heads.    Grasshopper, with blessings showered on him until he was fairly out of  sight, set forth with good heart. He thought he heard loud laughter  resounding after him in the direction of the lodge of the two old men;  but it could not have been the two old men, for they were, certainly,  too old to laugh.    He walked briskly all day, and at night he had the satisfaction of  reaching a lodge in all respects like that which he had left in the  morning. There were two fine old men, and his treatment was in every  particular the same, even down to the parting blessing and the laughter  that followed him as he went his way.    After walking the third day, and coming to a lodge the same as before,  he was satisfied from the bearings of the course he had taken that he  had been journeying in a circle, and by a notch which he had cut in the  door-post that these were the same two old men, all along; and that,  despite their innocent faces and their very white heads, they had been  playing him a sorry trick.    \"Who are you,\" said Grasshopper, \"to treat me so? Come forth, I say.\"    They were compelled to obey his summons, lest, in his anger, he should  take their lives; and they appeared on the outside of the lodge.    \"We must have a little trial of speed, now,\" said Grasshopper.    \"A race?\" they asked. \"We are very old; we can not run.\"    \"We will see,\" said Grasshopper; whereupon he set them out upon the  road, and then he gave them a gentle push, which put them in motion.  Then he pushed them again--harder--harder--until they got under fine  headway, when he gave each of them an astounding shock with his foot,  and off they flew at a great rate, round and round the course; and such  was the magic virtue of the foot of Grasshopper, that no object once set  agoing by it could by any possibility stop; so that, for aught we know  to the contrary, the two innocent, white-headed, merry old men, are  trotting with all their might and main around the circle in which they  beguiled Grasshopper, to this day.    Continuing his journey, Grasshopper, although his head was warm and  buzzing with all sorts of schemes, did not know exactly what to do until  he came to a big lake. He mounted a high hill to try and see to the  other side, but he could not. He then made a canoe, and sailed forth.  The water was very clear--a transparent blue--and he saw that it  abounded with fish of a rare and delicate complexion. This circumstance  inspired him with a wish to return to his village, and to bring his  people to live near this beautiful lake.    Toward evening, coming to a woody island, he encamped and ate the fish  he had speared, and they proved to be as comforting to the stomach as  they were pleasing to the eye. The next day Grasshopper returned to the  main land, and as he wandered along the shore he espied at a distance  the celebrated giant, Manabozho, who is a bitter enemy of Grasshopper,  and loses no opportunity to stop him on his journeyings and to thwart  his plans.    At first it occurred to Grasshopper to have a trial of wits with the  giant, but, on second thoughts, he said to himself, \"I am in a hurry  now; I will see him another time.\"    With no further mischief than raising a great whirlwind of dust, which  caused Manabozho to rub his eyes severely, Grasshopper quietly slipped  out of the way; and he made good speed withal, for in much less time  than you could count half the stars in the sky of a winter night, he had  reached home.    His return was welcomed with a great hubbub of feasting and songs; and  he had scarcely set foot in the village before he had invitations to  take pot-luck at different lodges, which would have lasted him the rest  of his natural life. Pipe-bearer, who had some time before given up the  cares of a ruler, and fallen back upon his native place, fairly danced  with joy at the sight of Grasshopper, who, not to be outdone, dandled  him affectionately in his arms, by casting him up and down in the air  half a mile or so, till little Pipe-bearer had no breath left in his  body to say that he was happy to see Grasshopper home again.    Grasshopper gave the village folks a lively account of his adventures,  and when he came to the blue lake and the abundant fish, he dwelt upon  their charms with such effect that they agreed, with one voice, that it  must be a glorious place to live in, and if he would show them the way  they would shift camp and settle there at once.    He not only showed them the way, but bringing his wonderful strength and  speed of foot to bear, in less than half a day he had transported the  whole village, with its children, women, tents, and implements of war,  to the new water-side.    Here, for a time, Grasshopper appeared to be content, until one day a  message came for him in the shape of a bear, who said that their king  wished to see him immediately at his village. Grasshopper was ready in  an instant; and mounting upon the messenger's back, off he ran. Toward  evening they climbed a high mountain, and came to a cave where the  bear-king lived. He was a very large person; and puffing with fat and a  sense of his own importance, he made Grasshopper welcome by inviting him  in to his lodge.    As soon as it was proper, he spoke, and said that he had sent for him on  hearing that he was the chief who was moving a large party toward his  hunting-grounds.    \"You must know,\" said the bear-king with a terrible growl, \"that you  have no right there, and I wish you would leave the country with your  party, or else the strongest force will take possession. Take notice.\"    \"Very well,\" replied Grasshopper, going toward the door, for he  suspected that the king of the bears was preparing to give him a hug.  \"So be it.\"    He wished to gain time, and to consult his people; for he had seen as he  came along that the bears were gathering in great force on the side of  the mountain. He also made known to the bear-king that he would go back  that night that his people might be put in immediate possession of his  royal behest.    The bear-king replied that Grasshopper might do as he pleased, but that  one of his young men was at his command; and, jumping nimbly on his  back, Grasshopper rode home.    He assembled the people, and ordered the bear's head off, to be hung  outside of the village, that the bear-spies, who were lurking in the  neighborhood, might see it and carry the news to their chief.    The next morning, by break of day, Grasshopper had all of his young  warriors under arms and ready for a fight. About the middle of the  afternoon the bear war-party came in sight, led on by the pursy king,  and making a tremendous noise. They advanced on their hind-legs, and  made a very imposing display of their teeth and eyeballs.    The bear-chief himself came forward, and with a majestic wave of his  right hand, said that he did not wish to shed the blood of the young  warriors; but that if Grasshopper, who appeared to be the head of the  war-party, consented, they two would have a race, and the winner should  kill the losing chief, and all his young men should be servants to the  other.    Grasshopper agreed, of course--how little Pipe-bearer, who stood by,  grinned as they came to terms!--and they started to run before the whole  company of warriors who stood in a circle looking on.    At first there was a prospect that Grasshopper would be badly beaten;  for although he kept crowding the great fat bear-king till the sweat  trickled from his shaggy ears, he never seemed to be able to push past  him. By and by, Grasshopper, going through a number of the most  extraordinary maneuvers in the world, raised about the great fat  bear-king such eddies and whirlwinds with the sand, and so danced about,  before and after him, that he at last got fairly bewildered, and cried  out for them to come and take him off. Out of sight before him in  reaching the goal, Grasshopper only waited for the bear-king to come up,  when he drove an arrow straight through him, and ordered them to take  the body away and make it ready for supper; as he was getting hungry.    He then directed all of the other bears to fall to and help prepare the  feast; for in fulfillment of the agreement they had become servants.  With many wry faces the bears, although bound to act becomingly in their  new character, according to the forfeit, served up the body of their  late royal master; and in doing this they fell, either by accident or  design, into many curious mistakes.    [Illustration: THE BEAR SERVANTS. Page 59.]    When the feast came to be served up, and they were summoned to be in  attendance, one of them, a sprightly young fellow of an inquisitive turn  of mind, was found upon the roof of the lodge, with his head half way  down the smoke-hole, with a view to learn what they were to have for  dinner. Another, a middle-aged bear with very long arms, who was put in  charge of the children in the character of nurse, squeezed three or four  of the most promising young papooses to death, while the mothers were  outside to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2225"],[0,"\"Captains Courageous\": A Story of the Grand Banks (#7)"],[1,".  A couple of lines, with very heavy leads and double cod-hooks, all  neatly coiled on square reels, were stuck in their place by the gunwale.    \"Where's the sail and mast?\" said Harvey, for his hands were beginning  to blister.    Dan chuckled. \"Ye don't sail fishin'-dories much. Ye pull; but ye  needn't pull so hard. Don't you wish you owned her?\"    \"Well, I guess my father might give me one or two if I asked 'em,\"  Harvey replied. He had been too busy to think much of his family till  then.    \"That's so. I forgot your dad's a millionaire. You don't act millionary  any, naow. But a dory an' craft an' gear\"--Dan spoke as though she were  a whale-boat \"costs a heap. Think your dad 'u'd give you one fer--fer a  pet like?\"    \"Shouldn't wonder. It would be 'most the only thing I haven't stuck him  for yet.\"    \"Must be an expensive kinder kid to home. Don't slitheroo thet way,  Harve. Short's the trick, because no sea's ever dead still, an' the  swells'll--\"    Crack! The loom of the oar kicked Harvey under the chin and knocked him  backward.    \"That was what I was goin' to say. I hed to learn too, but I wasn't  more than eight years old when I got my schoolin'.\"    Harvey regained his seat with aching jaws and a frown.    \"No good gettin' mad at things, dad says. It's our own fault ef we  can't handle 'em, he says. Le's try here. Manuel'll give us the water.\"    The \"Portugee\" was rocking fully a mile away, but when Dan up-ended an  oar he waved his left arm three times.    \"Thirty fathom,\" said Dan, stringing a salt clam on to the hook. \"Over  with the dough-boys. Bait same's I do, Harve, an' don't snarl your  reel.\"    Dan's line was out long before Harvey had mastered the mystery of  baiting and heaving out the leads. The dory drifted along easily. It  was not worth while to anchor till they were sure of good ground.    \"Here we come!\" Dan shouted, and a shower of spray rattled on Harvey's  shoulders as a big cod flapped and kicked alongside. \"Muckle, Harvey,  muckle! Under your hand! Quick!\"    Evidently \"muckle\" could not be the dinner-horn, so Harvey passed over  the maul, and Dan scientifically stunned the fish before he pulled it  inboard, and wrenched out the hook with the short wooden stick he  called a \"gob-stick.\" Then Harvey felt a tug, and pulled up zealously.    \"Why, these are strawberries!\" he shouted. \"Look!\"    The hook had fouled among a bunch of strawberries, red on one side and  white on the other--perfect reproductions of the land fruit, except  that there were no leaves, and the stem was all pipy and slimy.    \"Don't tech 'em! Slat 'em off. Don't--\"    The warning came too late. Harvey had picked them from the hook, and  was admiring them.    \"Ouch!\" he cried, for his fingers throbbed as though he had grasped  many nettles.    \"Naow ye know what strawberry-bottom means. Nothin' 'cep' fish should  be teched with the naked fingers, dad says. Slat 'em off ag'in' the  gunnel, an' bait up, Harve. Lookin' won't help any. It's all in the  wages.\"    Harvey smiled at the thought of his ten and a half dollars a month, and  wondered what his mother would say if she could see him hanging over  the edge of a fishing-dory in mid-ocean. She suffered agonies whenever  he went out on Saranac Lake; and, by the way, Harvey remembered  distinctly that he used to laugh at her anxieties. Suddenly the line  flashed through his hand, stinging even through the \"flippers,\" the  woolen circlets supposed to protect it.    \"He's a logy. Give him room accordin' to his strength,\" cried Dan.  \"I'll help ye.\"    \"No, you won't,\" Harvey snapped, as he hung on to the line. \"It's my  first fish. Is--is it a whale?\"    \"Halibut, mebbe.\" Dan peered down into the water alongside, and  flourished the big \"muckle,\" ready for all chances. Something white and  oval flickered and fluttered through the green. \"I'll lay my wage an'  share he's over a hundred. Are you so everlastin' anxious to land him  alone?\" Harvey's knuckles were raw and bleeding where they had been  banged against the gunwale; his face was purple-blue between excitement  and exertion; he dripped with sweat, and was half blinded from staring  at the circling sunlit ripples about the swiftly moving line. The boys  were tired long ere the halibut, who took charge of them and the dory  for the next twenty minutes. But the big flat fish was gaffed and  hauled in at last.    \"Beginner's luck,\" said Dan, wiping his forehead. \"He's all of a  hundred.\"    Harvey looked at the huge grey-and-mottled creature with unspeakable  pride. He had seen halibut many times on marble slabs ashore, but it  had never occurred to him to ask how they came inland. Now he knew; and  every inch of his body ached with fatigue.    \"Ef dad was along,\" said Dan, hauling up, \"he'd read the signs plain's  print. The fish are runnin' smaller an' smaller, an' you've took baout  as logy a halibut's we're apt to find this trip. Yesterday's catch--did  ye notice it?--was all big fish an' no halibut. Dad he'd read them  signs right off. Dad says everythin' on the Banks is signs, an' can be  read wrong er right. Dad's deeper'n the Whale-hole.\"    Even as he spoke some one fired a pistol on the \"We're Here\", and a  potato-basket was run up in the fore-rigging.    \"What did I say, naow? That's the call fer the whole crowd. Dad's onter  something, er he'd never break fishin' this time o' day. Reel up,  Harve, an' we'll pull back.\"    They were to windward of the schooner, just ready to flirt the dory  over the still sea, when sounds of woe half a mile off led them to  Penn, who was careering around a fixed point, for all the world like a  gigantic water-bug. The little man backed away and came down again with  enormous energy, but at the end of each manoeuvre his dory swung round  and snubbed herself on her rope.    \"We'll hey to help him, else he'll root an' seed here,\" said Dan.    \"What's the matter?\" said Harvey. This was a new world, where he could  not lay down the law to his elders, but had to ask questions humbly.  And the sea was horribly big and unexcited.    \"Anchor's fouled. Penn's always losing 'em. Lost two this trip  a'ready,--on sandy bottom, too,--an' dad says next one he loses, sure's  fish-in', he'll give him the kelleg. That 'u'd break Penn's heart.\"    \"What's a 'kelleg'?\" said Harvey, who had a vague idea it might be some  kind of marine torture, like keel-hauling in the story-books.    \"Big stone instid of an anchor. You kin see a kelleg ridin' in the bows  fur's you can see a dory, an' all the fleet knows what it means. They'd  guy him dreadful. Penn couldn't stand that no more'n a dog with a  dipper to his tail. He's so everlastin' sensitive. Hello, Penn! Stuck  again? Don't try any more o' your patents. Come up on her, and keep  your rodin' straight up an' down.\"    \"It doesn't move,\" said the little man, panting. \"It doesn't move at  all, and indeed I tried everything.\"    \"What's all this hurrah's-nest for'ard?\" said Dan, pointing to a wild  tangle of spare oars and dory-roding, all matted together by the hand of  inexperience.    \"Oh, that,\" said Penn, proudly, \"is a Spanish windlass. Mr. Salters  showed me how to make it; but even that doesn't move her.\"    Dan bent low over the gunwale to hide a smile, twitched once or twice  on the roding, and, behold, the anchor drew at once.    \"Haul up, Penn,\" he said, laughing, \"er she 'll git stuck again.\"    They left him regarding the weed-hung flukes of the little anchor with  big, pathetic blue eyes, and thanking them profusely.    \"Oh, say, while I think of it, Harve,\" said Dan, when they were out of  ear-shot, \"Penn ain't quite all caulked. He ain't nowise dangerous, but  his mind's give out. See?\"    \"Is that so, or is it one of your father's judgments?\" Harvey asked, as  he bent to his oars. He felt he was learning to handle them more easily.    \"Dad ain't mistook this time. Penn's a sure'nuff loony. No, he ain't  thet, exactly, so much ez a harmless ijjit. It was this way (you're  rowin' quite so, Harve), an' I tell you 'cause it's right you orter  know. He was a Moravian preacher once. Jacob Boller wuz his name, dad  told me, an' he lived with his wife an' four children somewheres out  Pennsylvania way. Well, Penn he took his folks along to a Moravian  meetin',--camp-meetin', most like,--an' they stayed over jest one night  in Johnstown. You've heered talk o' Johnstown?\"    Harvey considered. \"Yes, I have. But I don't know why. It sticks in my  head same as Ashtabula.\"    \"Both was big accidents--thet's why, Harve. Well, that one single night  Penn and his folks was to the hotel Johnstown was wiped out. 'Dam bu'st  an' flooded her, an' the houses struck adrift an' bumped into each  other an' sunk. I've seen the pictures, an' they're dretful. Penn he  saw his folk drowned all 'n a heap 'fore he rightly knew what was  comin'. His mind give out from that on. He mistrusted somethin' hed  happened up to Johnstown, but for the poor life of him he couldn't  remember what, an' he jest drifted araound smilin' an' wonderin'. He  didn't know what he was, nor yit what he hed bin, an' thet way he run  ag'in' Uncle Salters, who was visitin' 'n Allegheny City. Ha'af my  mother's folks they live scattered inside o' Pennsylvania, an' Uncle  Salters he visits araound winters. Uncle Salters he kinder adopted  Penn, well knowin' what his trouble wuz; an' he brought him East, an'  he give him work on his farm.\"    \"Why, I heard him calling Penn a farmer last night when the boats  bumped. Is your Uncle Salters a farmer?\"    \"Farmer!\" shouted Dan. \"There ain't water enough 'tween here an'  Hatt'rus to wash the furrer-mould off'n his boots. He's Jest  everlastin' farmer. Why, Harve, I've seen thet man hitch up a bucket,  long towards sundown, an' set twiddlin' the spigot to the scuttle-butt  same's ef 'twuz a cow's bag. He's thet much farmer. Well, Penn an' he  they ran the farm--up Exeter way, 'twuz. Uncle Salters he sold it this  spring to"]]]
