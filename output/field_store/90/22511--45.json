The best example of true yellow in a pigment, tending neither to red nor  blue, is furnished by _Aureolin_, alluded to in the last chapter. The  secondary and tertiary colours, having all duplex relations, may  incline without default to either of their relatives.    _Transparency_ is an essential property of all glazing pigments, and  adds greatly to the value of dark or shading colours; indeed it is the  prime quality upon which depth and darkness depend, as whiteness, or  light, does upon opacity or reflecting power. _Opacity_ is, therefore,  the antagonist of transparency, and qualifies pigments to cover in  dead-colouring, or solid painting, as well as to combine with  transparent colours in forming tints; and hence it is that  semi-transparent pigments are suited in a mean degree both for dead  colouring and for finishing. As excellencies, therefore, transparency  and opacity are relative only--the first being as indispensable to shade  in all its gradations, as the latter is to light. With regard to  transparent and opaque colours generally, it is worthy of attention in  the practice of the oil-painter, that the best effects of the former are  produced when they are used with a resinous varnish; as opaque pigments  are best employed in oil, and the two become united with best effect in  a mixture of these vehicles. The natural and artificial powers, or depth  and brilliancy, of every colour lie within the extremes of black and  white; hence it follows that the most powerful effects of transparent  colours are obtained by glazing them over black and white. As, however,  few transparent pigments have sufficient body, or tinging power for  this, it is often necessary to glaze them over tints, or deep opaque  colours of the required hues. There is a charm in transparent colours  which frequently leads to an undue use thereof in glazing; but glazing,  scumbling, and their combined process must be employed with discretion,  according to the objects and effects of a picture.    _Working well_ is a quality which depends principally upon fineness of  texture, and what is called _body_ in colours; yet every pigment has its  peculiarities in respect to working both in water and oil, and these  must become matter of every artist's special experience. Some of the  best pigments are most difficult of management, while some ineligible  colours are rich in body and free in working. Accidental circumstances,  however, may influence all pigments in these respects, according to the  painter's particular mode of operation, and his vehicle; upon the  affinities of colours with which depend their general faculties of  working--such as keeping their place, crispness or setting up, and  drying well. These latter, with other properties and accidents of  pigments, will be particularly considered in treating of their  individual characters; but it may be remarked that crispness or setting  up, as well as keeping their place and form in which they are applied,  are contrary to the nature of many pigments, and depend in painting with  them upon a gelatinous mixture of their vehicle. For example, mastic  and other resinous varnishes impart this texture to oils which have been  rendered drying by the acetate, or sugar of lead:--simple water, also  albumen, and animal jelly made of glue and isinglass, give the same  quality to oils and colours; and bees-wax has a similar effect in pure  oils. Whitelac varnish, and other spirit varnishes, rubbed into the  colours on the palette likewise enable them to keep their place very  effectually in most instances. This is important, because glazing cannot  be performed except with a vehicle which keeps its place, or with  pigments which lend this property to the vehicle, as some lakes and  transparent colours do.    _Fineness of texture_ is produced by extreme grinding and levigation.  Pigments ground in water in the state of a thick paste, are miscible in  oil and dry therein firmly; and in case of utility or necessity, any  water-colour in cake, being rubbed off thick in water may be diffused in  oil, the gum acting as a medium of union between the two. Thus, pigments  which cannot otherwise be employed in oil, or varnish, may be forced  into the service and add to the resources of the oil-painter, care being  taken to use the palette-knife, if of steel, with caution.    _Desiccation or drying._ The well-known additions of the acetate, or  sugar of lead, litharge, and sulphate of zinc, either mechanically  ground, or in solution, for light colours; and japanner's gold size, or  oils boiled upon litharge, for lakes; or, in some cases, manganese and  verdigris for dark colours, are resorted to when the pigments or  vehicles are not sufficiently good dryers alone. It would be well if  lead and copper could be banished from the list of siccatives  altogether: assuredly, no artist with any regard for the permanent  texture of his work should employ them except in extreme cases, and in  the smallest possible quantity. The best of pigments may be ruined by  their injudicious use, and obtain a character for fugacity which they in  no way deserve. It requires attention that an excess of dryer renders  oil saponaceous, is inimical to drying, and is otherwise injurious. Some  colours dry badly from not being sufficiently edulcorated or washed.  Sulphate of zinc, as a siccative, is less powerful than acetate of lead,  but is far preferable in a chemical sense. It is supposed erroneously to  set the colours running; which is not positively the case, though it  will not retain those disposed to move, because it wants the property  the acetate of lead possesses, of gelatinizing the mixture of oil and  varnish. These two dryers should not be employed together, since they  counteract and decompose each other, forming two new substances--acetate  of zinc, which is a bad siccative, and sulphate of lead, which is  insoluble and opaque. The inexperienced ought here to be guarded against  the highly improper practice of some artists, who strew their pictures  while wet with acetate of lead, or use that substance in some other  mode, without grinding or solution; which, though it may promote present  drying, will ultimately effloresce on the surface of the work, throw off  the colour in sandy spots, and expose the paintings to peculiar risk  from the damaging influence of impure air.    It is not always that ill drying is to be attributed to the pigments or  vehicles, the states of the weather and atmosphere have great influence  thereon. The direct rays of the sun are powerfully active in rendering  oils and colours siccative, and were probably resorted to before dryers  were--not always wisely--added to oils, particularly in the warm climate  of Italy. The ground may also advance or retard drying, because some  pigments united by mixing or glazing, become either more or less  siccative by their conjunction. Many other accidental circumstances may  likewise affect drying; and among these none is to be more guarded  against by the artist than the presence of soap and alkali, too often  left in the washing of his brushes, and which, besides other bad  results, decompose and are decomposed by acetate of lead and most  siccatives. In such cases desiccation is retarded, streaks and patches  are formed on the painting, and the odium of ill drying falls upon some  unlucky pigment. To free brushes from this disadvantage, they should be  cleansed with linseed oil and turpentine. Dryers should be added to  colours only at the time of using them, because they exercise their  drying property while chemically combining with the oils employed,  during which the latter become thick or fatten. Too much of the  siccative will, as before noticed, often retard drying.    The various affinities of pigments occasion each to have its more or  less appropriate dryer; and it would be a matter of useful experience if  the habits of every colour in this respect were ascertained. It is  probable that siccatives of less power generally than the compounds of  lead and copper might come into use in particular cases, such as the  oxides of manganese, to which umber and the Cappagh browns owe their  drying quality.    To other good attributes of pigments, it would be well if we could in  all cases add the property of being _innoxious_. As this, however,  cannot be, and colours are by no means to be sacrificed on that account,  cleanliness and avoiding the habit of putting the brush unnecessarily to  the mouth, so common in water-painting, are sufficient guards against  any possibly pernicious effects from the use of any pigment. No colour  which is not imbibed by the stomach will in the slightest degree injure  the health of the artist.            PART III.           *       *       *       *       *    ON COLOURS AND PIGMENTS INDIVIDUALLY.          CHAPTER VI.    ON COLOURS AND PIGMENTS INDIVIDUALLY.      Having briefly discussed the relations and attributes of colours and  pigments generally, we come to their powers and properties  individually--a subject pregnant with materials and of unlimited  connexions, every substance in nature and art possessing colour, the  first quality of pigments.    With regard to _colours_ individually, it is a general law of their  relations, confirmed by nature and the impressions of sense, that those  colours which lie nearest in nature to light have their greatest beauty  in their lightest tints: and that those which tend similarly towards  shade are most beautiful in their greatest depth or fulness, a rule of  course applying to black and white particularly. Thus, the most  beautiful yellow, like white, is that which is lightest and most vivid;  blue is most beautiful when deep and rich; while red is of greatest  beauty when of intermediate depth, or somewhat inclined to light;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20916"],[0,"The Arabian Nights: Their Best-known Tales (#7)"],[1,"all perished. If  you persist in your design, you may make the experiment. You will be  fortunate if it succeeds, but I would advise you not to expose yourself  to the danger.\"    \"My good father,\" replied the princess, \"I am sure my precaution will  succeed, and am resolved to try the experiment. Nothing remains for me  but to know which way I must go, and I conjure you not to deny me that  information.\" The dervish exhorted her again to consider well what she  was going to do; but finding her resolute, he took out a bowl, and  presenting it to her, said: \"Take this bowl, mount your horse again, and  when you have thrown it before you, follow it through all its windings,  till it stops at the bottom of the mountain; there alight and ascend the  hill. Go, you know the rest.\"    After the princess had thanked the dervish, and taken her leave of him,  she mounted her horse, threw the bowl before her, and followed it till  it stopped at the foot of the mountain.    She then alighted, stopped her ears with cotton, and after she had well  examined the path leading to the summit began with a moderate pace and  walked up with intrepidity. She heard the voices and perceived the great  service the cotton was to her. The higher she went, the louder and more  numerous the voices seemed, but they were not capable of making any  impression upon her. She heard a great many affronting speeches and  raillery very disagreeable to a woman, which she only laughed at. \"I  mind not,\" said she to herself, \"all that can be said, were it worse; I  only laugh at them and shall pursue my way.\" At last, she climbed so  high that she could perceive the cage and the Bird which endeavoured, in  company with the voices, to frighten her, crying in a thundering tone,  notwithstanding the smallness of its size: \"Retire, fool, and approach  no nearer.\"    The princess, encouraged by this sight, redoubled her speed, and by  effort gained the summit of the mountain, where the ground was level;  then running directly to the cage and clapping her hand upon it, cried:  \"Bird, I have you, and you shall not escape me.\"    While Periezade was pulling the cotton out of her ears the Bird said to  her: \"Heroic princess, be not angry with me for joining with those who  exerted themselves to preserve my liberty. Though in a cage, I was  content with my condition; but since I am destined to be a slave, I  would rather be yours than any other person's, since you have obtained  me so courageously. From this instant, I swear entire submission to all  your commands. I know who you are. You do not; but the time will come  when I shall do you essential service, for which I hope you will think  yourself obliged to me. As a proof of my sincerity, tell me what you  desire and I am ready to obey you.\"    The princess's joy was the more inexpressible, because the conquest she  had made had cost her the lives of two beloved brothers, and given her  more trouble and danger than she could have imagined. \"Bird,\" said she,  \"it was my intention to have told you that I wish for many things which  are of importance, but I am overjoyed that you have shown your goodwill  and prevented me. I have been told that there is not far off a Golden  Water, the property of which is very wonderful; before all things, I ask  you to tell me where it is.\" The Bird showed her the place, which was  just by, and she went and filled a little silver flagon which she had  brought with her. She returned at once and said: \"Bird, this is not  enough; I want also the Singing Tree; tell me where it is.\" \"Turn  about,\" said the Bird, \"and you will see behind you a wood where you  will find the tree.\" The princess went into the wood, and by the  harmonious concert she heard, soon knew the tree among many others, but  it was very large and high. She came back again and said: \"Bird, I have  found the Singing Tree, but I can neither pull it up by the roots nor  carry it.\" The Bird replied: \"It is not necessary that you should take  it up; it will be sufficient to break off a branch and carry it to plant  in your garden; it will take root as soon as it is put into the earth,  and in a little time will grow to as fine a tree as that you have seen.\"    When the princess had obtained possession of the three things for which  she had conceived so great a desire, she said again: \"Bird, what you  have yet done for me is not sufficient. You have been the cause of the  death of my two brothers, who must be among the black stones I saw as I  ascended the mountain. I wish to take the princes home with me.\"    The Bird seemed reluctant to satisfy the princess in this point, and  indeed made some difficulty to comply. \"Bird,\" said the princess,  \"remember you told me that you were my slave. You are so; and your life  is in my disposal.\" \"That I cannot deny,\" answered the bird; \"but  although what you now ask is more difficult than all the rest, yet I  will do it for you. Cast your eyes around,\" added he, \"and look if you  can see a little pitcher.\" \"I see it already,\" said the princess. \"Take  it then,\" said he, \"and as you descend the mountain, sprinkle a little  of the water that is in it upon every black stone.\"    The princess took up the pitcher accordingly, carried with her the cage  and Bird, the flagon of Golden Water, and the branch of the Singing  Tree, and as she descended the mountain, threw a little of the water on  every black stone, which was changed immediately into a man; and as she  did not miss one stone, all the horses, both of her brothers and of the  other gentlemen, resumed their natural forms also. She instantly  recognised Bahman and Perviz, as they did her, and ran to embrace her.  She returned their embraces and expressed her amazement. \"What do you  here, my dear brothers?\" said she, and they told her they had been  asleep. \"Yes,\" replied she, \"and if it had not been for me, perhaps you  might have slept till the day of judgment. Do not you remember that you  came to fetch the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree, and the Golden Water,  and did not you see, as you came along, the place covered with black  stones? Look and see if there be any now. The gentlemen and their horses  who surround us, and you yourselves, were these black stones. If you  desire to know how this wonder was performed,\" continued she, showing  the pitcher, which she set down at the foot of the mountain, \"it was  done by virtue of the water which was in this pitcher, with which I  sprinkled every stone. After I had made the Talking Bird (which you see  in this cage) my slave, by his directions I found out the Singing Tree,  a branch of which I have now in my hand; and the Golden Water, with  which this flagon is filled; but being still unwilling to return without  taking you with me, I constrained the Bird, by the power I had over him,  to afford me the means. He told me where to find this pitcher, and the  use I was to make of it.\"    The Princes Bahman and Perviz learned by this relation the obligation  they had to their sister, as did all the other gentlemen, who expressed  to her that, far from envying her happiness in the conquest she had  made, and which they all had aspired to, they thought they could not  better express their gratitude for restoring them to life again, than by  declaring themselves her slaves, and that they were ready to obey her in  whatever she should command.    \"Gentlemen,\" replied the princess, \"if you had given any attention to my  words, you might have observed that I had no other intention in what I  have done than to recover my brothers; therefore, if you have received  any benefit, you owe me no obligation, and I have no further share  in your compliment than your politeness toward me, for which I return  you my thanks. In other respects, I regard each of you as quite as free  as you were before your misfortunes, and I rejoice with you at the  happiness which has accrued to you by my means. Let us, however, stay no  longer in a place where we have nothing to detain us, but mount our  horses and return to our respective homes.\"    [Illustration]    _It will be sufficient to break off a branch and carry it to plant in  your garden._    The princess took her horse, which stood in the place where she had left  him. Before she mounted, Prince Bahman desired her to give him the cage  to carry. \"Brother,\" replied the princess, \"the Bird is my slave and I  will carry him myself; if you will take the pains to carry the branch of  the Singing Tree, there it is; only hold the cage while I get on  horseback.\" When she had mounted her horse, and Prince Bahman had given  her the cage, she turned about and said to Prince Perviz: \"I leave the  flagon of Golden Water to your care, if it will not be too much trouble  for you to carry it,\" and Prince Perviz accordingly took charge of it  with pleasure.    When Bahman, Perviz, and all the gentlemen had mounted their horses, the  princess waited for some of them to lead the way. The two princes paid  that compliment to the gentlemen, and they again to the princess, who,  finding that none of them would accept the honour, but that it was  reserved for her, addressed herself to them and said: \"Gentlemen, I  expect that some of you should lead the way;\" to which one who was  nearest to her, in the name of the rest, replied: \"Madam, were we  ignorant of the respect due to your sex, yet after what you have done  for us there is no deference we would not willingly pay you,  notwithstanding your modesty; we entreat you no longer to deprive us of  the happiness of following you.\"    \"Gentlemen,\" said the princess, \"I do not deserve the honour you do me,  and accept it only because you desire it.\" At the same time she led the  way, and the two princes and the gentlemen followed.    This illustrious company called upon the dervish as they passed, to  thank him for his reception and wholesome advice, which they had all  found to be sincere. He was dead, however;"]]]
