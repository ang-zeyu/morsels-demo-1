[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22605"],[0,"Book-Lovers, Bibliomaniacs and Book Clubs (#7)"],[1," agent declares to have been  placed in his hands to dispose of as quickly as possible, regardless  of cost. No widow's cruse, apparently, could be more unfailing in its  supply than this 'private library.' While annoying, the device of a  '---- Society,' though manifestly designed to confuse the public mind  and trade on the reputation of this Club, can scarcely deceive our  members or even the book-loving public. It, nevertheless, is an  annoyance, and the more vexatious because scarcely calling for other  remedy than exposure.    \"It is possible, however, that harm to the good name of the Club may  be wrought through the advertisement, in an English newspaper, to  which my attention has been drawn, of a so-called '---- Society of  Great Britain,' which is declared to have been recently formed in  conjunction with the '---- Society of the United States,' which is  described as having been established in 1884, and to have occupied its  own Club House since 1888, and to have published handsomely printed  books for sale exclusively to the members. It is announced, however,  that the '---- Society of Great Britain,' although intending to act in  conjunction with the American society, 'will work upon somewhat  different lines, at any rate at first.' It may well be that this  cleverly deceptive advertisement will require some attention from us,  either directly or through members resident abroad.    \"This, however, seems to be the only fly in our ointment, and we may  congratulate ourselves that there is nothing more serious to disturb  our enjoyment of the anniversary which we now celebrate.\"    Another and more palpable fraud has been perpetrated in copying the  name of The Bibliophile Society, but with a slight prefix, just enough  to afford a loop-hole through which to escape legal prosecution. Not  enough, however, to enable the public to distinguish between the  spurious and the genuine, and even the members themselves have  sometimes been deceived by unscrupulous agents representing their  wares as the regular productions of the valid society. The audacious  promoters of this so-called Society had the boldness not only to  pilfer the name of the legitimate society, but also the name of its  president, which was ostentatiously printed upon their letter heads,  together with the name of Dr. Richard Garnett. Both of these gentlemen  have recently published their denunciations through the columns of the  press, and protested vigorously against this unauthorized use of their  names.    The _modus operandi_ of this pestiferous concern is to send numbered  \"complimentary certificates\" throughout the country to persons whose  names are obtainable from directories, and when acknowledgment cards  are received from those who deign to accept the exalted compliment,  they are forthwith called upon, usually by some \"officer\" of the  Society,--sometimes the \"President,\" but usually the \"Treasurer,\"  \"Secretary,\" or \"Registrar.\"    Some time ago I was honored by a call from one of these circumventive  \"Treasurers,\" but happened to be conveniently busy at the time, and so  made an appointment with him to meet me at my office the next day.  Meanwhile, I prepared to have his statements reduced to writing by a  stenographer, anticipating that it might be necessary to refresh my  memory upon certain passages that I might fail to remember verbatim.  The following is the substance of the \"canvass\" as taken by the  stenographer in an adjoining room, the door of which was wide open:--    \"I am the Treasurer of the ---- Society, with headquarters in  London. By a special grant from the English Government, we have  recently been permitted to extend our membership into this country,  and three hundred life members are to be admitted under this  enlargement of our constitutional privileges. It may interest you,  first, to know something of the origin of this Society. It was  organized in London about three hundred years ago by the Duke of  Roxburghe [who was not born until more than a hundred years later],  and was originally composed of about thirty members of the royal  family. The original charter limited the membership to fifty members,  and in less than a month the limit was reached. Through the powerful  influence of the royal family the Society had easy access to all the  great repositories of unpublished manuscripts, and the most valuable  and interesting of them were selected for publication. These  publications became so enormously valuable that it stimulated a desire  on the part of others to join the Society, and particularly, some of  the nobility of France and Germany. It was decided to increase the  membership to three hundred, and to take in a few members from France,  Germany, Italy, and Russia. The Society thrived for about a thousand  years [this is either a stenographic error, or else he meant to say a  hundred]; then there was a period of inactivity, and later on it was  revived again, and the membership limit increased to five hundred.  Last year we obtained permission to again increase the membership by  taking in three hundred prominent people in America. I am over here to  arrange for three vice-presidents,--two for the East and one for the  West. I have a special commission to ask you to become one of the  honorary vice-presidents and to offer you a life membership for less  than half the regular fee, viz., $225.00; the usual fee for life  membership is $500.00, but you get it for $225.00 on account of acting  as our honorary vice-president for this territory. Of course you would  have no regular duties to perform. You would sign all the membership  certificates in your district, and in case of the death of any member,  you would have the privilege of naming his successor.    \"The Society issues every year a volume giving all the price  currents for the year, and keeps the members posted on the advance or  decline in the value of all important publications. We also give you  in confidence the ratings of various publishers, and print reports to  members exposing all the frauds in the book business. Upon payment of  the fee of $225.00, you receive all of this material free, for the  balance of your life, and in addition all of the Society's regular  publications, including the present one, consisting of ---- volumes  [here he produced the customary specimen sheets]. You see this one  work alone is worth the full amount you pay for life membership [here  occurred a \"special offer\" of some sort, given in a low monotone which  the stenographer was unable to hear; and I must confess that I was so  stupefied by this astounding fabrication that I myself have not the  faintest recollection of what this \"special offer\" consisted]. We are  very anxious to have your name as our honorary vice-president here,  because you will not only be an honor to the Society, but the Society  will be an honor to you.\"    Here my Treasurer friend produced a regular form of subscription  contract for a set of books; but it contained no clause about life  membership, or any other membership, and included no promise of  anything further than the delivery of the books.    The honor of such a vice-presidency being thrust upon me was indeed a  thrilling sensation, and the story was told in a fluent, cohesive, and  logical manner; so well, in fact, that had I not known in advance that  it was purely imaginary from beginning to end, I could scarcely have  avoided giving it full acceptance. But I had heard of the story  before, and although partially prepared, it staggered me surprisingly.  I afterwards learned that every one else canvassed by my interviewer  was equally offered one of the \"three vice-presidencies.\"    There appears to be no defense for book clubs against these bogus  impersonations. The injured club, or society, can sustain no claim for  any special damage, because, as not offering its publications in the  open market, it actually suffers no ascertainable loss of patronage.  The principal damage results to those who are thus victimized in  permitting themselves to be deluded into the belief that they are  acquiring the valid editions of reputable clubs. When club  publications come into the open market they are usually picked up with  avidity by collectors, and they have thus grown into very general  favor among book-lovers. Indeed, the high esteem in which they have  come to be regarded offers a productive field for a few crafty  publishers to ply their wily designs in. The audacity of these  schemers carries them to such incredible measures that they sometimes  buy sheet-stock from reputable publishing houses, change the name of  the edition, and deliberately manufacture new titles on which they  print the name of some book club or society. These counterfeits are  sold to the unsuspecting book-buyer, who often imagines he has landed  a prize. Later, he is likely to become disillusioned. There can be no  doubt that the contemptible practice of thus mutilating and garbling  books should be defined as a felony and made punishable by fine or  imprisonment. Book-buyers, however, can in a measure help the  situation and protect themselves by not dealing with such people; they  should particularly remember that creditable book clubs _never_ employ  soliciting agents, and rarely, if ever, offer their publications for  sale outside of the membership. Any one, therefore, representing  himself as an authorized agent of a book club may usually be branded  as an impostor. Most book clubs print only such number of copies of  each publication as are subscribed and paid for by members in advance,  and the funds thus advanced are used to pay the cost of the edition.    Notwithstanding the evils referred to, the book club is with us to  stay, and the very fact that it is continually pestered by these  hangers-on is conclusive proof of its potency and usefulness; features  which insure its secure foundation in the community.    Very few people "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22606"],[0,"The Booklover and His Books (#7)"],[1,"sing, but still  earlier in the dimensions of the book itself--the most modern and  profitable instance of using the east wind for a filler.    But at this point a new element is introduced, the public library. The  ordinary buyer carries home the distended book, and after he and his  family have read it, he cares not if it falls to pieces after the next  reading. Neither does he care if it takes up thrice the room that it  should, for he no longer gives it room. But the public library, under  the existing inflationism, must not only pay too much for its popular  books; it must also house them at a needless outlay, and must very early  duplicate a serious percentage of their first cost in rebinding them. So  burdensome has this last item become that our libraries are consenting  to pay a slightly larger first cost in order to avoid the necessity of  rebinding; and enterprising publishers, following the lead of a more  enterprising bookbinder, are beginning to cater to this library demand,  which some day, let us hope, may dominate the entire publishing world  for all books worth preserving, and may extend to all the elements of  the book.    But fortunately there is here and there the uncommercial publisher and  now and then an uncommercial mood in the ordinary publisher. To these we  owe a small but important body of work of which no previous age need  have been ashamed. Of these books we may almost say that they would be  books if there were nothing in them. They have come into being by a  happy conjunction of qualified publisher and appreciative buyers. They  show what most books may be and what all books will strive to be if ever  the majority of book buyers come to know what a good book is. This  brings us finally to the book of to-morrow, what we hope it will be and  how we can make it so.    The book of to-morrow, the book as it ought to be, will be both better  and cheaper than the book of to-day. It can afford to be cheaper, for it  will have a large and appreciative public, and for the same reason it  will have to be better. The question of supreme importance now, if this  public is ever to exist, is: How to educate our book buyers. The answer  is not easy, for our book buyers do not realize that they are untrained,  and, even if they realized it, the task of training them in the  knowledge and love of the well-made book would be difficult. But we can  do at least three things: agitate--proclaim the existence of a lore to  be acquired, an ignorance and its practices to be eschewed;  illustrate--show the good book and the bad together, and set forth,  point by point, why the good is superior; last and most important, we  must vindicate--back up our words by our deeds, support the publisher  who gives the world good books, and leave to starvation or reform the  publisher who clings to the old unworthy methods of incapacity or fraud.  Even now, if every enlightened booklover in America would carry out this  plan as a matter of duty merely where he could do so without  inconvenience, nothing less than a revolution would be upon us, and we  should have the Book of To-morrow while it is still To-day.          A CONSTRUCTIVE CRITIC OF THE BOOK      At the meeting of the British librarians at Cambridge in 1882 a bomb was  thrown into the camp of the book producers in the form of the question:  Who spoils our new English books? In the explosion which followed,  everybody within range was hit, from \"the uncritical consumer\" to \"the  untrained manufacturer.\" This dangerous question was asked and answered  by Henry Stevens of Vermont, who, as a London bookseller, had for nearly  forty years handled the products of the press new and old, had numbered  among his patrons such critical booklovers as John Carter Brown and  James Lenox, and had been honored with the personal friendship of  William Pickering the publisher and Charles Whittingham the printer. He  had therefore enjoyed abundant opportunity for qualifying himself to  know whereof he spoke. If his words were severe, he stood ready to  justify them with an exhibit of sixty contemporary books which he set  before his hearers.[2]    The truth is, however unwilling his victims may have been to admit it,  that his attack was only too well timed. The men of creative power, who  had ennobled English book production during the second quarter of the  nineteenth century, had passed away, and books were being thrown  together instead of being designed as formerly. The tradition of  excellence in English bookmaking still held sway over the public, and,  as their books sold, most producers saw no reason to disturb themselves.  What to them was progress in other lands, or the claims of a future that  could not be enforced? But after Mr. Stevens's attack they could at  least no longer plead ignorance of their faults. It is certain that an  improvement soon began, which culminated in the present great era of  book design throughout the English world. If the famous bookseller's  address were not the cause of the change, it at least marked a turning  point, and it deserves to be studied as one of the historic documents of  modern printing. It is more than this, however; it is a piece of  creative criticism, and though teaching not by example but by  contraries, it forms one of the best existing brief compends of what a  well-made book must be.    The critic of books as they were made a generation ago begins with the  assertion of a truth that cannot be too often repeated: \"The manufacture  of a beautiful and durable book costs little if anything more than that  of a clumsy and unsightly one.\" He adds that once a handsome book and a  new English book were synonymous terms, but that now the production of  really fine books is becoming one of England's lost arts. He indulges in  a fling at \"the efforts of certain recent printers to retrieve this  decadence by throwing on to the already overburdened trade several big,  heavy, and voluminous works of standard authors termed 'editions de  luxe.'\" He assures his hearers that his judgments were not formed on the  spur of the moment, but were based partly on long personal  observations--Stevens was the author of that widely influential piece of  selective bibliography, \"My English Library,\" London, 1853--and on the  results of the international exhibitions since 1851, especially those  of Vienna (1874), Philadelphia (1876), and Paris (1878), in the last of  which he was a juror. His conclusion is \"that the present new English,  Scotch, and Irish books, of a given size and price, are not of the  average quality of high art and skill in manufacture that is found in  some other countries.\" He reminds his hearers that \"it is no excuse to  say that the rapidity of production has been largely increased. That  amounts merely to confessing that we are now consuming two bad books in  the place of one good one.\"    Mr. Stevens now comes to the direct question: Who spoils our new English  books? He answers it by naming not less than ten parties concerned: (1)  the author, (2) the publisher, (3) the printer, (4) the reader, (5) the  compositor, (6) the pressman or machinist, (7) the papermaker, (8) the  ink maker, (9) the bookbinder, and (10), last but not least, the  consumer. There is no question of honesty or dishonesty, he says, but  there is a painful lack of harmony, the bungling work of one or the  clumsy manipulation of another often defeating the combined excellence  of all the rest. The cure he foresees in the establishment of a school  of typography, in which every disciple of these ten tribes shall study a  recognized grammar of book manufacture based on the authority of the  best examples.    He now returns to the charge and pays his respects to each member of the  \"ten tribes\" in turn. The author's offense is found to consist largely  of ignorant meddling. The publisher is too often ignorant, fussy,  unskilled, pedantic, shiftless, and money-seeking, willing to make books  unsightly if their cheapness will sell them. The printer is the  scapegoat, and many books are spoiled in spite of his efforts, while he  gets all the blame. But he is apt to have faults of his own, the worst  of which is a failure in the careful design of the books intrusted to  him. \"It was not so,\" says Mr. Stevens, \"with our good old friends  William Pickering and Charles Whittingham, publisher and printer,  working for many years harmoniously together. It was their custom, as  both used repeatedly to tell us, to each first sit upon every new book  and painfully hammer out in his own mind its ideal form and proportions.  Then two Sundays at least were required to compare notes in the little  summer house in Mr. Whittingham's garden at Chiswick, or in the  after-dinner sanctuary, to settle the shape and dress of their  forthcoming 'friend of man.' It was amusing as well as instructive to  see each of them, when they met, pull from his bulging side pocket  well-worn title-pages and sample leaves for discussion and  consideration. When they agreed, perfection was at hand, and the 'copy'  went forward to the compositors, but not till then. The results, to this  day, are seen in all the books bearing the imprint of William Pickering,  nearly all of which bear also evidence that they came from the 'Chiswick  Press.'\"    The reader, Mr. Stevens holds to be, under the printer, the real man of  responsibility; but he too is often hampered by want of plan and due  knowledge of the proportions of the book that he is handling. He also  should go to the school of typography, and the readers of different  offices should learn to agree. The compositor is pronounced \"a little  person of great consequence.\" His moral responsibility is not great, but  too much is often thrust upon him; in fact he is, in many cases, the  real maker of the book. \"He ought to have a chance at the school of  typography, and be better instructed in his own business, and be taught  not to assume"]]]
