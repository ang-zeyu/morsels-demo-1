Then a rat squealed again, near at hand. Oh yes, they were everywhere,  ever since Monsieur Gautier rented the left wing of the house to store  grain in; and they were _so_ tame and _so_ large that Madame was obliged  to keep miou-miou in her bedroom every night.    That decided our book-hunter. Enthusiasm can be carried too far. Even the  possibilities of a rich trover would not compensate for having rats  running about one's bed at night. Moreover the vermin would surely have  gnawed, if not devoured, any copies of the 'Pastissier' that might have  been lying about, even if these were innocent of bacon-grease stains. And  so consoling himself, he took another 'petit verre' and departed, casting  more than one regretful glance backwards at the old Lion d'Or.    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Apparently there is only one copy of Upton's work in the United  States at present--that which was formerly in the Huth Library. It was  purchased at Sotheby's in July, 1920, by a well-known New York dealer,  Mr. G. D. Smith, for ten guineas, the writer of these lines being the  underbidder. Mr. Smith had sent \"an unlimited commission\" to secure it.  An announcement in _The Bookman's Journal_ (1920) asking for information  respecting other copies elicited but one response.    Since writing the above, the author has secured the splendid presentation  copy given by Upton's editor (Bysshe) to the great Parliamentary leader,  Sir Humphrey Mackworth, of Neath, in Glamorganshire. It had remained at  Glen Uske until the dispersal of the Mackworth Library in 1920.    [2] No. 16096. See page 164.    [3] Possibly the title was _Nigromanser_, from _niger_, black, and  _manser_, a bastard.    [4] The perfect copy was purchased by Mr. Pierpont Morgan at the sale of  the Hoe Library, in 1911, for L8,560. It formed originally one of the  twenty-two Caxtons which were dispersed in 1698 with the library of Dr.  Francis Bernard, Physician to King James the Second, when it realised two  and tenpence! It became the property of the great Robert Harley, Earl of  Oxford, and was acquired later by the Countess of Jersey for two and a  half guineas. Passing thus into the Osterley Park collection, it was  purchased, when that library was sold in 1885, by Bernard Quaritch for  L1,950, becoming the property, the same year, of Mrs. Abby E. Pope, of  Brooklyn, U.S.A.    [5] By Edward More of Hambledon, Bucks.    [6] Mr. E. G. Duff.

[9] Alas for romance! Truth compels me to add that as the Great Fire  swept across this very court, the existing house must date at earliest  from King Charles' reign. But the site and tradition as to its former  owner may well be true.    [10] _The Courtier_, by Baldassare Castiglione, was first printed at  Venice in 1528, folio. This letter was written by the fearless churchman,  then of Wolsey's household, on the great Cardinal's 'last lingering  journey north.' There is, perhaps, a certain significance in his wish to  study a volume which treats of the art of living in courts, and of  becoming useful and agreeable to princes, for he was shortly to transfer  his services to a royal master.    [11] At the sale of Baron Seilliere's books in 1887, a copy of this  prototype of the Elzevier volume, printed at Paris 'chez Jean Gaillard,'  1653, brought only L6, 10s. It was described as 'a beautiful copy, red  morocco, super extra, gilt edges, by Petit.' It is exceedingly rare,  but--it is not an Elzevier.    [12] A recent (1920) catalogue offers a copy for thirty-five shillings.    [13] I confess that I do, but then I am hopelessly out of date, or I  shouldn't be fond of Elzeviers.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER II    THE LIBRARY          'Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:      Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,      He to his studie goes.'--SPENSER.      WHAT magic there is for the book-lover in that word 'library'! Does it  not instantly conjure up a vision of happy solitude, a peaceful seclusion  where we may lie hidden from our fellow-creatures, an absence of idle  chatter to distract our thoughts, and countless books about us on either  hand? No man with any pretensions to learning can possibly fail to be  impressed when he enters an ancient library, older perhaps by generations  than the art of printing itself.        'With awe, around these silent walks I tread,       These are the lasting mansions of the dead:       \"The dead!\" methinks a thousand tongues reply,       \"These are the tombs of such as cannot die!\"       Crowned with eternal fame, they sit sublime,       And laugh at all the little strife of time.'    They are delicious retreats, abodes of seasoned thought and peaceful  meditation, these ancient homes of books. 'I no sooner come into the  library,' wrote Heinz, that great literary counsellor of the Elzeviers,  'than I bolt the door, excluding Lust, Ambition, Avarice, and all such  vices, whose nurse is Idleness, the mother of Ignorance and Melancholy.  In the very lap of Eternity, among so many divine souls, I take my seat  with so lofty a spirit and sweet content, that I pity all great men and  rich to whom this happiness is unknown.'    Happy indeed are those days when the book-lover has been accorded the  freedom of some ancient library. A delicious feeling of tranquillity  pervades him as he selects some nook and settles himself to read.  Presently the mood takes him to explore, and he wanders about from case  to case, now taking down some plump folio and glancing at the title-page  and type, now counting the engravings of another and collating it in his  mind, now comparing the condition of a third with the copy which he has  at home, now searching through the text of some small duodecimo to see  whether it contains the usual blanks or colophon. But presently he will  chance upon some tome whose appeal is irresistible. So he retires with it  to his nook, and is soon absorbed once more with that tranquillity which  is better than great riches.    Dearly, however, though we may treasure the benefits and conveniences  which these libraries of ancient foundation afford, for most of us there  is another library that is nearer to our hearts; that cosy chamber with  which we are accustomed to associate warmth, comfort, soft chairs and  footrests, a wide writing-table that we may pile high with books, with  scribbling-paper, foolscap and marking-slips in plenty. In short, a room  so far removed from earthly cares and noise, that the dim occasional  sounds of the outside world serve but to accentuate our absolute  possession of ease. Here we may labour undisturbed though surrounded by a  thousand friends. Or, if the mood take us, we may abandon ourselves to  idle meditation        'Where glowing embers through the room       Teach light to counterfeit a gloom,'    and, lying back at our ease, may gaze contentedly upon the faithful  companions of our crowded solitude, gathering inspiration from their  silent sympathy.    Each to his taste. Whether we be student, book-hunter, librarian, or  precentor,[14] no earthly abode can be compared with that garden of our  choice wherein we labour so contentedly. It may be a small room in our  own house, it may be an ancient university or college library, but it is  all one: it is a library, that haven of refuge from our worldly cares,  where troubles are forgotten and sorrows lightened by the gently  persuasive experience of the wise men that have gone before us.    But, mark you, it must be literally removed from cares and noise, for it  is impossible to study at all deeply while exposed to interruption. How  terribly most of us have suffered from this form of mental torture, for  it is little else! What trains of lucid thought, what word-pictures have  been destroyed by thoughtless breakings of the chain of sequence! 'I have  never known persons who exposed themselves for years to constant  interruption who did not muddle away their intellects by it at last,'  wrote Miss Florence Nightingale. Hamerton, quoting her, is equally  emphatic upon this point.    'If,' he writes, 'you are reading in the daytime in a house where there  are women and children, or where people can fasten upon you for pottering  details of business, you may be sure that you will _not_ be able to get  to the end of the passage without in some way or other being rudely  awakened from your dream, and suddenly brought back into the common  world. The loss intellectually is greater than any one who had not  suffered from it could imagine. People think that an interruption is  merely the unhooking of an electric chain, and that the current will  flow, when the chain is hooked on again, just as it did before. To the  intellectual and imaginative student an interruption is not that; it is  the destruction of a picture.'    Who has not suffered from the idle chatter, or even worse--the lowered  voice, that often assails the ear when working in our larger public  libraries? Some innocent-looking individual will be reading quietly some  paces away, so quietly and decorously in fact that one's heart goes out  to him as a sympathetic fellow-bookman. Then enters some one whom he  knows. In a flash he becomes a fiend incarnate. A word or two of greeting  spoken in an ordinary voice one would pardon; but a long conversation is  carried on in a monotonous forced undertone, terrible in its intensity.  It is impossible to read so long as the conversation lasts, and murder  surges in one's heart.

Provence.          I.    THE CATHEDRALS OF THE SEA.      [Sidenote: Marseilles.]    Perhaps a Phoenician settlement, certainly a Carthaginian mart, later a  Grecian city, and in the final years of the pagan era possessed by the  Romans, no city of France has had more diverse influences of antique  civilisation than Marseilles, none responded more proudly to its ancient  opportunities; and not only was it commercially wealthy and renowned,  but so rich in schools that it was called \"another, a new Athens.\" It  was also the port of an adventurous people, who founded Nice, Antibes,  la Ciotat, and Agde, and explored a part of Africa and Northern Europe;  and at the fall of the Roman Empire it became, by very virtue of its  riches and safe harbour, the envy and the prey of a succession of  barbaric and \"infidel\" invaders. In the Middle Ages it had all the  vicissitudes of wars and sieges to which a great city could be  subjected. It had a Viscount, and from very early days, a Bishop; it was  at one time part of the Kingdom of Arles; and later it recognised the  suzerainty of the Counts of Provence. When these lords were warring or  crusading, it took advantage of their absence or their troubles and  governed itself through its Consuls; became a Provencal Republic after  the type of the Italian cities and other towns of the Mediterranean  country; treated with the Italian Republics on terms of perfect  equality; and although finally annexed to France by the wily Louis of  the Madonnas, its people were continually haunted by memories of their  former independence, and not only struggled for municipal rights and  liberties, but took sides for or against the most powerful monarchs of  continental history as if they had been a resourceful country rather  than a city. It succored the League, defied Henry IV and Richelieu; and  treating Kings in trouble as cavalierly as declining Counts, Marseilles  tried at the death of Henry III to secede from France and recover its  autonomy under a Consul, Charles de Cazaulx. Promptly defeated, it still  continued to think independently, and struggle, as best it might, for  freedom of administration; and although from the time of Pompey to that  of Louis XIV it has had an ineradicable tendency to stand against the  government, it has survived the results of all its contumacies, its  plagues, wars, and sieges, and the destructiveness of its phase of the  Revolution, when it had a Terror of its own. Notwithstanding modern  rivals in the Mediterranean, Marseilles is to-day one of the largest and  most prosperous of French cities. Built in amphitheatre around the bay,  it is beautiful in general view, its streets bustle with commercial  activity, and its vast docks swarm with workmen. The storms of the past  have gone over Marseilles as the storms of nature over its sea, have  been as passionate, and have left as little trace. Instead of Temples,  Forum, and Arena, there are the Palais de Longchamps, the Palais de  Justice, and the Christian Arch of Triumph. Instead of the muddy and  unhealthy alley-ways of Mediaevalism, there are broad streets and wide  boulevards, and in spite of its antiquity Marseilles is a city of  to-day, in monuments, aspect, spirit, and even in class distinction.  \"Here,\" writes Edmond About, \"are only two categories of people, those  who have made a fortune and those who are trying to make one, and the  principal inhabitants are parvenus in the most honourable sense of the  word.\"    [Illustration: _Entrevaux._    People gather around the mail-coach as it makes its daily halt before  the drawbridge.]    [Illustration: THE NEW CATHEDRAL.--MARSEILLES.]    \"In the most honourable sense of the word,\" the Cathedral of Marseilles  is also typical of the city, \"parvenue.\" Its first stone was placed by  Prince Louis Napoleon in 1852, and as the modern has overgrown the  classic and mediaeval greatness of Marseilles, so the new \"Majeure\" has  eclipsed, if it has not yet entirely replaced, the old Cathedral; and  except the stern Abbey-church of Saint-Victor, an almost solitary relic  of true mediaeval greatness, it is the finest church of the city.    The new Cathedral and the old stand side by side; the one strong and  whole, the other partly torn down, scarred and maimed as a veteran who  has survived many wars. Even in its ruin, it is an interesting type of  the maritime Provencal church, but so pitiably overshadowed by its  successor that the charm of its situation is quite lost, and few will  linger to study its three small naves, the defaced fresco of the dome,  or even the little chapel of Saint-Lazare, all white marble and carving  and small statues, scarcely more than a shallow niche in the wall, but  daintily proportioned, and a charming creation of the Renaissance. Fewer  still of those who pause to study what remains of the old \"Majeure,\"  will stay to reconstruct it as it used to be, and realise that it had  its day of glory no less real than that of the new church which replaces  it. In its stead, Saint-Martin's, and Saint-Cannat's sometimes called  \"the Preachers,\" have been temporarily used for the Bishop's services.  But now that the greater church, the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin  Mary, has been practically completed, it has assumed, once and for all,  the greater rank, and a Cathedral of Marseilles still stands on its  terrace in full view of the sea. Tradition has it that a Temple of Baal  once stood on this site and later, a Temple to Diana; that Lazarus came  in the I century, converted the pagan Marseillais and built a Christian  Cathedral here. A more critical tradition says that Saint Victor first  came as missionary, Bishop, and builder. All these vague memories of  conversion, more or less accurate, all the legends of an humble and  struggling Christianity, seem buried by this huge modern mass. It is not  a church struggling and militant, but the Church Established and  Triumphant. It is a vast building over four hundred and fifty feet long,  preceded by two domed towers. Its transepts are surmounted at the  crossing by a huge dome whose circumference is nearly two hundred feet,  a smaller one over each transept arm, and others above the apsidal  chapels. The exterior is built with alternate layers of green Florentine  stone and the white stone of Fontvieille; and the style of the church,  variously called French Romanesque, Byzantine, and Neo-Byzantine, is  very oriental in its general effect.    An arcade between the two towers forms a porch, the entrance to the  interior whose central nave stretches out in great spaciousness. The  lateral naves, in contrast, are exceedingly narrow and have high  galleries supported by large monolithic columns. These naves are  prolonged into an ambulatory, each of whose chapels, in consonance with  the Cathedral's colossal proportions, is as large as many a church. The  building stone of the interior is grey and pink, with white marble used  decoratively for capitals and bases; and these combinations of tints  which would seem almost too delicate, too effeminate, for so large a  building, are made rich and effective by their very mass, the gigantic  sizes which the plan exacts. All that artistic conception could produce  has been added to complete an interior that is entirely oriental in its  luxury of ornamentation, half-oriental in style, and without that sober  majesty which is an inherent characteristic of the most elaborate styles  native to Western Christianity. Under the gilded dome is a rich  baldaquined High Altar, and through the whole church there is a  magnificence of mosaics, of mural paintings, and of stained glass that  is sumptuous. Mosaics line the arches of the nave and the pendentives,  and form the flooring; and in the midst of this richness of colour the  grey pillars rise, one after the other in long, shadowy perspective,  like the trees of a stately grove.    In planning this new Provencal Cathedral its architects did not attempt  to reproduce, either exactly or in greater perfection, any maritime type  which its situation on the Mediterranean might have suggested, nor were  they inspired by any of the models of the native style; and perhaps, to  the captious mind, its most serious defect is that its building has  destroyed not only an actual portion of the old Majeure, but an historic  interest which might well have been preserved by a wise restoration or  an harmonious re-building. And yet, with the large Palace of the  Archbishop on the Port de la Joliette near-by, the statue of a devoted  and loving Bishop in the open square, and the majestic Cathedral of  Sainte-Marie-Majeure itself, the episcopacy of Marseilles has all the  outward and visible signs of strength and glory and power.      [Sidenote: Toulon.]    Toulon, although a foundation of the Romans, owes its rank to-day to  Henry IV, to Richelieu, and to Louis XIV's busy architect, Vauban. It is  the \"Gibraltar of France,\" a bright, bustling, modern city.  Sainte-Marie-Majeure, one of its oldest ecclesiastical names, is a title  which belonged to churches of both the XI and XII centuries; but in the  feats of architectural gymnastics to which their remains have been  subjected, and in the wars and vicissitudes of Provence, these buildings  have long since disappeared.    A few stones still exist of the XI century structure, void of form or  architectural significance, and the ancient name of Sainte-Marie-Majeure  now protects a Cathedral built in the most depressing style of the  industrious Philistines of the XVII and XVIII centuries. It is not a  Provencal nor a truly \"maritime\" church, it is not a fortress nor a  defence, nor a work of any architectural beauty. It has blatancy, size,  pretension,--a profusion of rich incongruities; and although"]]]
