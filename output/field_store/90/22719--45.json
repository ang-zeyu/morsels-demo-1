As has been said, in this valley these handsome  sparrows were quite plentiful; but when, toward evening, I clambered  over a ridge, and descended into the valley of Moraine Lake, several  hundred feet lower than the Seven Lakes valley, what was my surprise to  find not a white-crown there! The next day I trudged up to the Seven  Lakes, and found the white-crowns quite abundant in the copses, as they  had been farther up the hollow on the previous day; and, besides, in a  boggy place about two miles below Moraine Lake there were several pairs,  and I was fortunate enough to find a nest. Strange--was it not?--that  these birds should avoid the copsy swamps near Moraine Lake, and yet  select for breeding homes the valleys both above and below it. Perhaps  the valley of Moraine Lake is a little too secluded and shut in by the  towering mountains on three sides, the other places being more open and  sunshiny.    The upper valley was the summer home of that musician _par excellence_  of the Rockies, the green-tailed towhee, and he sang most divinely,  pouring out his                                     \"full heart      In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.\"    Having elsewhere described his minstrelsy and habits with more or less  fulness, I need give him only this passing reference here. A little bird  with which I here first made acquaintance was an elegant species known  as Audubon's warbler, which may be regarded as the western  representative of the myrtle warbler of the East. The two birds are  almost counterparts. Indeed, at first I mistook the Audubon for the  myrtle. The former has a yellow throat, while the latter's throat is  white.    In all the upper mountain valleys, and on the steep slopes of the  western as well as the eastern side of the Divide, I had the Audubon  warblers often at my elbow. In summer they make their homes at an  altitude of seven to eleven thousand feet, and are partial to pine  timber; indeed, I think I never found them elsewhere, save occasionally  among the quaking asps. I learned to distinguish Audubon's chanson from  those of his fellow-minstrels. It is not much of a song--a rather weak  little trill, with a kind of drawl in the vocalization that forms its  diagnostic feature. The persistency with which it is repeated on the  solitary pine-clad mountain sides constitutes its principal charm.    The winter haunts of Audubon's warblers are farther south than Colorado,  mostly in Mexico and Guatemala, although a few of them remain in the  sheltered mountain valleys of the western part of the United States.  Early in May they appear on the plains of eastern Colorado, where they  are known only as migrants. Here a double movement presently takes  place--what might be called a longitudinal and a vertical migration--one  division of the warbler army sweeping north to their breeding grounds in  Canada, and the other wheeling westward and ascending to the alpine  heights among the mountains, where they find the subartic conditions  that are congenial to their natures without travelling so great a  distance. Here they build their nests in the pine or spruce trees, rear  their families, and as autumn approaches, descend to the plains, tarry  there a week or two, then hie to their winter homes in the South.    One of the most gorgeous tenants of this valley was Wilson's warbler.[3]  It wears a dainty little cap that is jet black, bordered in front and  below with golden yellow, while the upper parts are rich olive and the  lower parts bright yellow. These warblers were quite abundant, and were  evidently partial to the thickets covering the boggy portions of the  vale. While Audubon's warblers kept themselves for the most part among  the pines on the slopes and acclivities, the little black-caps preferred  the lower ground. Their songs were not brilliant performances, though  rather pleasing, being short, jerky trills, somewhat lower in the scale  than those of the well-known summer warbler.        [3] Mr. Aiken says, \"The Rocky Mountain representative of Wilson's      warbler is an intermediate form, nearest the Pacific coast bird      which is distinguished as the pileolated warbler.\"    While I was stalking about in the low, boggy part of the hollow, my  attention was attracted by an odd little song that came rolling down  from the pines on the mountain side. At length, time was found to go to  the place whence the song came. What could the gay little minstrel be?  Somewhere I had heard such minstrelsy--but where? There were runs in it  that bore some resemblance to certain strains of the Carolina wren's  vigorous lays, but this songster's voice was of a finer quality and had  less volume than that of the Carolina. The little bird was found  flitting among the pines, and continued to sing his gay little ballad  with as much vigor as before. Indeed, my presence seemed to inspire him  to redouble his efforts and to sing with more snap and challenge. He  acted somewhat like a wren, but was smaller than any species of that  family with which I was acquainted, and no part of his plumage was  barred with brown and white.    Now the midget in feathers leaped up the alternating branches of a pine,  and now he flew down and fluttered amid the chaos of dead logs and  boughs on the ground, all the while rolling his ditty from his limber  tongue. Beginning with an exceedingly fine whistle, which could not  be heard far away, he descanted in sounds that it is impossible to  convey in syllables. The best literation of his song that I was  able to make was the following: \"Tse-e-ek, tse-e-ek, tse-e-e-ek,  cholly-cholly-cholly, che-che-che, pur-tie, pur-tie, pur-tie!\" the  _pur-tie_ accented strongly on the second syllable and the whole  performance closing with an interrogative inflection.    For a long time I watched the little acrobat, but could not settle his  identity. Some hours later, while stalking along the other side of the  valley, I heard the song duplicated; this time the singer elevated his  crest feathers, and at once I recognized him; he was the ruby-crowned  kinglet, of course, of course! It was a shame not to identify him at  first sight. In Ohio I had often heard his song during the migrating  season, and now remembered it well; but never dreaming that the  ruby-crown would be found in these alpine districts, I was completely  thrown off my reckoning on hearing his quaint melodies.    [Illustration: _Ruby-Crowned Kinglet_    \"_The singer elevated his crest feathers_\"]    The ruby-crowned kinglet migrates to these heights in the spring and  rears his brood at an elevation of from nine thousand feet to the  timber-line, building a nest far up in a pine tree; whereas his eastern  kindred hie to the northern part of the United States and beyond, to  find summer homes and suitable breeding grounds. Within their chosen  boundaries the rubies are very plentiful in the Rockies, their quaint  rondeaus tumbling down from every pine-clad acclivity. In October they  descend to the plains, and in the latter part of the month hurry off to  a more southerly clime.    The birds were most abundant in the upper part of the valley, keeping  close to the precipitous heights of the Peak. It was a long walk down to  the mountaineer's cabin, and I had reason to be glad for not having  undertaken to find it the evening before, as I should certainly have  lost my way in the darkness. No one was at home now, but through the  screen door I could see a canary in a cage. Not a very inviting place to  spend the night, I reflected, and I crossed the valley, climbed a steep  ridge, following a slightly used wagon road, and trudged down the other  side into what I afterwards found was the valley of Moraine Lake, one of  the crystal sheets of water that are seen from the summit of Pike's Peak  sparkling in the sunshine. While climbing the ridge, I saw my first  mountain chickadee, capering about in the trees. He called like the  familiar black-cap, and his behavior was much like that bird's. As will  be seen in another chapter, I afterwards heard the mountain chickadee's  song on the western side of the range, and found it to be quite unlike  the minor strain of our pleasant black-cap of the East.    On the mountain side forming the descent to Moraine Lake a flock of  Clark's nutcrackers were flying about in the pine woods, giving  expression to their feelings in a great variety of calls, some of them  quite strident. A little junco came in sight by the side of the trail,  and hopped about on the ground, and I was surprised to note a reddish  patch ornamenting the centre of his back. Afterwards I learned that it  was the gray-headed junco, which is distinctly a western species,  breeding among the mountains of Colorado. Thrashing about among some  dead boles, and making a great to-do, were a pair of small woodpeckers,  which closely resembled the well-known downies of our eastern  longitudes. I suppose them to have been their western representatives,  which are known, according to Mr. Aiken and Professor Cooke, as  Batchelder's woodpecker. Near the same place I saw a second pair of  mountain bluebirds, flitting about somewhat nervously, and uttering a  gentle sigh at intervals; but as evening was now rapidly approaching, I  felt the need of finding lodging for the night, and could not stop to  hunt for their nest.    Faring down the mountain side to the lake, I circled around its lower  end until I came to the cottage of the family who have the care of the  reservoirs that supply the three towns at the foot of the mountains  with water fresh from the snow-fields. Here, to my intense relief, I was  able to secure lodging and board as long as I desired to remain.    I enjoyed the generous hospitality offered me for two nights and  considerably more than one day.

CHAPTER III.         _Galileo announces his discoveries in Enigmas--Discovers the       Crescent of Venus--the Ring of Saturn--the Spots on the       Sun--Similar Observations made in England by Harriot--Claims of       Fabricius and Scheiner to the discovery of the Solar       Spots--Galileo's Letters to Velser on the claims of Scheiner--His       residence at the Villa of Salviati--Composes his work on Floating       Bodies, which involves him in new controversies._      The great success which attended the first telescopic observations of  Galileo, induced him to apply his best instruments to the other planets  of our system. The attempts which had been made to deprive him of the  honour of some of his discoveries, combined, probably, with a desire to  repeat his observations with better telescopes, led him to announce his  discoveries under the veil of an enigma, and to invite astronomers to  declare, within a given time, if they had observed any new phenomena in  the heavens.    Before the close of 1610, Galileo excited the curiosity of astronomers  by the publication of his first enigma. Kepler and others tried in vain  to decipher it; but in consequence of the Emperor Rodolph requesting a  solution of the puzzle, Galileo sent him the following clue:--         \"Altissimam planetam tergeminam observavi.\"         I have observed that the most remote planet is triple.    In explaining more fully the nature of his observation, Galileo remarked  that Saturn was not a single star, but three together, nearly touching  one another. He described them as having no relative motion, and as  having the form of three o's, namely, oOo, the central one being larger  than those on each side of it.    Although Galileo had announced that nothing new appeared in the other  planets, yet he soon communicated to the world another discovery of no  slight interest. The enigmatical letters in which it was concealed  formed the following sentence:--         \"Cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater Amorum.\"         Venus rivals the phases of the moon.    Hitherto, Galileo had observed Venus when her disc was largely  illuminated; but having directed his telescope to her when she was not  far removed from the sun, he saw her in the form of a crescent,  resembling exactly the moon at the same elongation. He continued to  observe her night after night, during the whole time that she could be  seen in the course of her revolution round the sun, and he found that  she exhibited the very same phases which resulted from her motion round  that luminary.    Galileo had long contemplated a visit to the metropolis of Italy, and he  accordingly carried his intentions into effect in the early part of the  year 1611. Here he was received with that distinction which was due to  his great talents and his extended reputation. Princes, Cardinals, and  Prelates hastened to do him honour; and even those who discredited his  discoveries, and dreaded their results, vied with the true friends of  science in their anxiety to see the intellectual wonder of the age.    In order to show the new celestial phenomena to his friends at Rome,  Galileo took with him his best telescope; and as he had discovered the  spots on the sun's surface in October or November 1610, or even  earlier,[16] he had the gratification of exhibiting them to his admiring  disciples. He accordingly erected his telescope in the Quirinal garden,  belonging to Cardinal Bandini; and in April 1611 he shewed them to his  friends in many of their most interesting variations. From their change  of position on the sun's disc, Galileo at first inferred, either that  the sun revolved about an axis, or that other planets, like Venus and  Mercury, revolved so near the sun as to appear like black spots when  they were opposite to his disc. Upon continuing his observations,  however, he saw reason to abandon this hasty opinion. He found that the  spots must be in contact with the surface of the sun,--that their  figures were irregular,--that they had different degrees of  darkness,--that one spot would often divide itself into three or  four,--that three or four spots would often unite themselves into  one,--and that all the spots revolved regularly with the sun, which  appeared to complete its revolution in about twenty-eight days.         [16] Professor Rigaud is of opinion that Galileo had discovered the       solar spots at an earlier period than eighteen months before May       1612.    Previous to the invention of the telescope, spots had been more than  once seen on the sun's disc with the unassisted eye. But even if these  were of the same character as those which Galileo and others observed,  we cannot consider them as anticipations of their discovery by the  telescope. As the telescope was now in the possession of several  astronomers, Galileo began to have many rivals in discovery; but  notwithstanding the claims of Harriot, Fabricius, and Scheiner, it is  now placed beyond the reach of doubt that he was the first discoverer of  the solar spots. From the communication which I received in 1822 from  the late Dr Robertson, of Oxford,[17] it appeared that Thomas Harriot  had observed the solar spots on the 8th of December 1610; but his  manuscripts, in Lord Egremont's possession,[18] incontestably prove that  his regular observations on the spots did not commence till December 1,  1611, although he had seen the spots at the date above mentioned, and  that they were continued till the 18th of January 1613. The  observations which he has recorded are 199 in number, and the accounts  of them are accompanied with rough drawings representing the number,  position, and magnitude of the spots.[19] In the observation of Harriot,  made on the 8th December 1610, before he knew of Galileo's discovery, he  saw three spots on the sun, which he has represented in a diagram. The  sun was then 7 deg. or 8 deg. high, and there was a frost and a mist, which no  doubt acted as a darkening glass. Harriot does not apply the name of  spots to what he noticed in this observation, and he does not enumerate  it among the 199 observations above mentioned. Professor Rigaud[20]  considers it \"a misapplication of terms to call such an observation a  discovery;\" but, with all the respect which we feel for the candour of  this remark, we are disposed to confer on Harriot the merit of an  original discoverer of the spots on the sun.         [17] See page 40.         [18] These interesting MSS. I have had the good fortune of seeing       in the possession of my much valued friend, the late Professor       Rigaud of Oxford.

Another candidate for the honour of discovering the spots of the sun,  was John Fabricius, who undoubtedly saw them previous to June 1611. The  dedication of the work[21] in which he has recorded his observation,  bears the date of the 13th of June 1611; and it is obvious, from the  work itself, that he had seen the spots about the end of the year 1610;  but as there is no proof that he saw them before October, we are  compelled to assign the priority of the discovery to the Italian  astronomer.         [21] Joh. Fabricii Phrysii de Maculis in Sole observatis, et       apparente earum cum Sole conversione, Narratio. Wittemb. 1611.    The claim of Scheiner, professor of mathematics at Ingolstadt, is more  intimately connected with the history of Galileo. This learned  astronomer having, early in 1611, turned his telescope to the sun,  necessarily discovered the spots which at that time covered his disc.  Light flying clouds happened, at the time, to weaken the intensity of  his light, so that he was able to show the spots to his pupils. These  observations were not published till January 1612; and they appeared in  the form of three letters, addressed to Mark Velser, one of the  magistrates of Augsburg, under the signature of _Appelles post Tabulam_.  Scheiner, who, many years afterwards, published an elaborate work on  the subject, adopted the same idea which had at first occurred to  Galileo--that the spots were the dark sides of planets revolving round  and near the sun.[22]         [22] It does not appear from the history of solar observations at       what time, and by whom, coloured glasses were first introduced for       permitting the eye to look at the sun with impunity. Fabricius was       obviously quite ignorant of the use of coloured glasses. He       observed the sun when he was in the horizon, and when his       brilliancy was impaired by the interposition of thin clouds and       floating vapours; and he advises those who may repeat his       observations to admit at first to the eye a small portion of the       sun's light, till it is gradually accustomed to its full splendour.       When the sun's altitude became considerable, Fabricius gave up his       observations, which he often continued so long that he was scarcely       able, for two days together, to see objects with their usual       distinctness. Fabricius speaks of observing the sun by admitting       his rays through a small _hole_ into a dark room, and receiving his       image on paper; but he says nothing about a lens or a telescope       being applied to the hole; and he does not say that he saw the       spots of the sun in this way. Harriot also viewed the solar spots       when the sun was near the horizon, or was visible through \"thick       layer and thin cloudes,\" or through thin mist. On December 21,       1611, at a quarter past 2 P.M., he observed the spots when the sky       was perfectly clear, but his \"sight was after dim for an houre.\"         Scheiner, in his \"Appelles post Tabulam,\" describes four different       ways of viewing the spots; one of"]]]
