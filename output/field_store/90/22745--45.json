This penalty was afterwards  altered to twenty pounds a month, but those were exempted who did not  obstinately refuse. The penalty on all above sixteen who neglected to go  for a month was abjuration of the realm; and to return to the realm  thereafter was felony. And two-thirds of the rent of the offender's  lands might also be seized till he conformed.    An ordinance of Edward III., in 1336, prohibited any man having more  than two courses at any meal. Each mess was to have only two sorts of  victuals, and it was prescribed how far one could mix sauce with his  pottage, except on feast days, when three courses, at most, were  allowable.    The Licinian law limited the quantity of meat to be used. The Orcian law  limited the expense of a private entertainment and the number of guests.  And for like reasons, the censors degraded a senator because ten pounds  weight of silver plate was found in his house. Julius Caesar was almost  as good a reformer as our modern Puritans. He restrained certain classes  from using litters, embroidered robes and jewels; limited the extent of  feasts; enabled bailiffs to break into the houses of rich citizens and  snatch the forbidden meats from off the tables. And we are told that the  markets swarmed with informers, who profited by proving the guilt of all  who bought and sold there. So in Carthage a law was passed to restrain  the exorbitant expenses of marriage feasts, it having been found that  the great Hanno took occasion of his daughter's marriage to feast and  corrupt the Senate and the populace, and gained them over to his  designs.    The Vhennic Court established by Charlemagne in Westphalia put every  Saxon to death who broke his fast during Lent. James II. of Arragon, in  1234, ordained that his subjects should not have more than two dishes,  and each dressed in one way only, unless it was game of his own killing.    The Statute of Diet of 1363 enjoined that servants of lords should have  once a day flesh or fish, and remnants of milk, butter and cheese; and  above all, ploughmen were to eat moderately. And the proclamations of  Edward IV. and Henry VIII. used to restrain excess in eating and  drinking. All previous statutes as to abstaining from meat and fasting  were repealed in the time of Edward VI. by new enactments, and in order  that fishermen might live, all persons were bound under penalty to eat  fish on Fridays or Saturdays, or in Lent, the old and the sick excepted.  The penalty in Queen Elizabeth's time was no less than three pounds or  three months' imprisonment, but at the same time added that whoever  preached or taught that eating of fish was necessary for the saving of  the soul of man, or was the service of God, was to be punished as a  spreader of false news. And care was taken to announce that the eating  of fish was enforced not out of superstition, but solely out of respect  to the increase of fishermen and mariners. The exemption of the sick  from these penalties was abolished by James I., and justices were  authorized to enter victualing houses and search and forfeit the meat  found there. All these preposterous enactments were swept away in the  reign of Victoria.    Of all the petty subjects threatening the cognizance of the law, none  seems to have given more trouble to the ancient and mediaeval  legislatures than that of dress. * * * Yet views of morality, of  repressing luxury and vice, of benefiting manufacturers, of keeping all  degrees of mankind in their proper places, have induced the legislature  to interfere, where interference, in order to be thorough, would require  to be as endless as it would be objectless.    Solon prohibited women from going out of the town with more than three  dresses. Zaleucus is said to have invented an ingenious method of  circuitously putting down what he thought bad habits, namely, by  prohibiting things with an exception, so that the exception should, in  the guise of an exemption, really carry out the sting and operate as a  deterrent. Thus he forbade a woman to have more than one maid, unless  she was drunk; he forbade her to wear jewels or embroidered robes, or go  abroad at night, except she was a prostitute; he forbade all but panders  to wear gold rings or fine cloth. And it was said that he succeeded  admirably in his legislation. The Spartans had such a contempt for  cowards that those who fled in battle were compelled to wear a low  dress of patches and shape, and, moreover, to wear a long beard half  shaved, so that any one meeting them might give them a stroke. The  Oppian law of Rome restricted women in their dress and extravagance, and  the Roman knights had the privilege of wearing a gold ring. The ancient  Babylonians held it to be indecent to wear a walking stick without an  apple, a rose, or an eagle engraved on the top of it. The first Inca of  Peru is said to have made himself popular by allowing his people to wear  ear-rings--a distinction formerly confined to the royal family. By the  code of China, the dress of the people was subject to minute regulation,  and any transgression was punished by fifty blows of the bamboo. And he  who omitted to go into mourning on the death of a relation, or laid it  aside too soon, was similarly punished. Don Edward of Portugal, in 1434,  passed a law to suppress luxury in dress and diet, and with his nobles  set an example. In Florence a like law was passed in 1471. And in  Venice, laws regulating nearly all the expenses of families, in table,  clothes, gaming and traveling. A law of the Muscovites obliged the  people to crop their beards and shorten their clothes. In Zurich a law  prohibited all except strangers to use carriages, and in Basle no  citizen or inhabitant was allowed to have a servant behind his carriage.  About 1292, Philip the Fair, of France, by edict, ordered how many suits  of clothes, and at what price, and how many dishes at table should be  allowed, and that no woman should keep a cur.    The Irish laws regulated the dress, and even its colors, according to  the rank and station of the wearer. And the Brehon laws forbade men to  wear brooches so long as to project and be dangerous to those passing  near. In Scotland, a statute enacted that women should not come to Kirk  or market with their faces covered, and that they should dress according  to their estate. In the City of London, in the thirteenth century, women  were not allowed to wear, in the highway or the market, a hood furred  with other than lamb-skin or rabbit-skin. In the Middle Ages, it was not  infrequent to compel prostitutes to wear a particular dress, so that  they might not be mistaken for other women. And this was the law in the  City of London, as appears from records of 1351 and 1382.    The views and objects of English legislators as to the general subject  of dress, however preposterous in our eyes, were grave and serious  enough. They were so confident of their ground that it was recited that  \"wearing inordinate and excessive apparel was a displeasure to God, was  an impoverishing of the realm and enriching other strange realms and  countries, to the final destruction of the husbandry of the realm, and  leading to robberies.\"    The Statute of Diet and Apparel in 1363, and the later statutes,  minutely fixed the proper dress for all classes according to their  estate, and the price they were to pay; handicraftsmen were not to wear  clothes above forty shillings, and their families were not to wear silk  or velvet. And so with gentlemen and esquires, merchants, knights and  clergy, according to graduations. Ploughmen were to wear a blanket and a  linen girdle. No female belonging to the family of a servant in  husbandry was to wear a girdle garnished with silver. Every person  beneath a lord was to wear a jacket reaching to his knees, and none but  a lord was to wear pikes to his shoes exceeding two inches. (1463.)  Nobody but a member of the royal family was to wear cloth of gold or  purple silk, and none under a knight to wear velvet, damask or satin, or  foreign wool, or fur of sable. It is true, notwithstanding all these  restrictions, that a license of the king enabled the licensee to wear  anything. For one whose income was under twenty pounds, to wear silk in  his night-cap was to incur three months' imprisonment or a fine of ten  pounds a day. And all above the age of six, except ladies and gentlemen,  were bound to wear on the Sabbath day a cap of knitted wool. These  statutes of apparel were not repealed till the reign of James I.    Sometimes, though rarely, a legislature has gone the length of suddenly  compelling an entire change of dress among a people, for reasons at the  time thought urgent.    In China a law was passed to compel the Tartars to wear Chinese clothes,  and to compel the Chinese to cut their hair, with a view to unite the  two races. And it was said there were many who preferred martyrdom to  obedience.    So late as 1746, a statute was passed to punish with six months'  imprisonment, and on a second offense with seven years' transportation,  the Scottish Highlanders, men or boys, who wore their national costume  or a tartan plaid, it being conceived to be closely associated with a  rebellious disposition. After thirty-six years the statute was repealed.  While the act was in force it was evaded by people carrying their  clothes in a bag over their shoulders. The prohibition was hateful to  all, as impeding their agility in scaling the craggy steeps of their  native fastnesses. In 1748 the punishment assigned by the act of 1746  was changed into compulsory service in the army.    Plato says it is one of the unwritten laws of nature that a man shall  not go naked into the market-place or wear woman's clothes. The Mosaic  law forbade men to wear women's clothes, which was thought to be a mode  of discountenancing the Assyrian rites of Venus. The early"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/273"],[0,"The Smalcald Articles (#7)"],[1," body and blood of Christ, and are  given and received not only by the godly, but also by wicked  Christians.    And that not only one form is to be given. [For] we do not  need that high art [specious wisdom] which is to teach us that  under the one form there is as much as under both, as the  sophists and the Council of Constance teach. For even if it  were true that there is as much under one as under both, yet  the one form only is not the entire ordinance and institution  [made] ordained and commanded by Christ. And we especially  condemn and in God's name execrate those who not only omit  both forms but also quite autocratically [tyrannically]  prohibit, condemn, and blaspheme them as heresy, and so exalt  themselves against and above Christ, our Lord and God  [opposing and placing themselves ahead of Christ], etc.    As regards transubstantiation, we care nothing about the  sophistical subtlety by which they teach that bread and wine  leave or lose their own natural substance, and that there  remain only the appearance and color of bread, and not true  bread. For it is in perfect agreement with Holy Scriptures  that there is, and remains, bread, as Paul himself calls it,  1 Cor. 10, 16: The bread which we break. And 1 Cor. 11, 28:  Let him so eat of that bread.      VII. Of the Keys.    The keys are an office and power given by Christ to the Church  for binding and loosing sin, not only the gross and well-known  sins, but also the subtle, hidden, which are known only to  God, as it is written in Ps. 19, 13: Who can understand his  errors? And in Rom. 7, 25 St. Paul himself complains that with  the flesh he serves the law of sin. For it is not in our  power, but belongs to God alone, to judge which, how great,  and how many the sins are, as it is written in Ps. 143, 2:  Enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight  shall no man living be justified. And Paul, 1 Cor. 4, 4, says:  For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified.    VIII. Of Confession.    Since Absolution or the Power of the Keys is also an aid and  consolation against sin and a bad conscience, ordained by  Christ [Himself] in the Gospel, Confession or Absolution ought  by no means to be abolished in the Church, especially on  account of [tender and] timid consciences and on account of  the untrained [and capricious] young people, in order that  they may be examined, and instructed in the Christian  doctrine.    But the enumeration of sins ought to be free to every one, as  to what he wishes to enumerate or not to enumerate. For as  long as we are in the flesh, we shall not lie when we say: \"I  am a poor man [I acknowledge that I am a miserable sinner],  full of sin.\" Rom. 7, 23: I see another law in my members,  etc. For since private absolution originates in the Office of  the Keys, it should not be despised [neglected], but greatly  and highly esteemed [of the greatest worth], as [also] all  other offices of the Christian Church.    And in those things which concern the spoken, outward Word, we  must firmly hold that God grants His Spirit or grace to no  one, except through or with the preceding outward Word, in  order that we may [thus] be protected against the enthusiasts,  i.e., spirits who boast that they have the Spirit without and  before the Word, and accordingly judge Scripture or the spoken  Word, and explain and stretch it at their pleasure, as Muenzer  did, and many still do at the present day, who wish to be  acute judges between the Spirit and the letter, and yet know  not what they say or declare. For [indeed] the Papacy also is  nothing but sheer enthusiasm, by which the Pope boasts that  all rights exist in the shrine of his heart, and whatever he  decides and commands with [in] his church is spirit and right,  even though it is above and contrary to Scripture and the  spoken Word.    All this is the old devil and old serpent, who also converted  Adam and Eve into enthusiasts, and led them from the outward  Word of God to spiritualizing and self-conceit, and  nevertheless he accomplished this through other outward words.  Just as also our enthusiasts [at the present day] condemn the  outward Word, and nevertheless they themselves are not silent,  but they fill the world with their pratings and writings, as  though, indeed, the Spirit could not come through the writings  and spoken word of the apostles, but [first] through their  writings and words he must come. Why [then] do not they also  omit their own sermons and writings, until the Spirit Himself  come to men, without their writings and before them, as they  boast that Me has come into them without the preaching of the  Scriptures? But of these matters there is not time now to  dispute at greater length; we have elsewhere sufficiently  urged this subject.    For even those who believe before Baptism, or become believing  in Baptism, believe through the preceding outward Word, as the  adults, who have come to reason, must first have heard: He  that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, even though  they are at first unbelieving, and receive the Spirit and  Baptism ten years afterwards. Cornelius, Acts 10, 1 ff., had  heard long before among the Jews of the coming Messiah,  through whom he was righteous before God, and in such faith  his prayers and alms were acceptable to God (as Luke calls him  devout and God-fearing), and without such preceding Word and  hearing could not have believed or been righteous. But St.  Peter had to reveal to him that the Messiah (in whom, as one  that was to come, he had hitherto believed) now had come, lest  his faith concerning the coming Messiah hold him captive among  the hardened and unbelieving Jews, but know that he was now to  be saved by the present Messiah, and must not, with the  [rabble of the] Jews deny nor persecute Him.    In a word, enthusiasm inheres in Adam and his children from  the beginning [from the first fall] to the end of the world,  [its poison] having been implanted and infused into them by  the old dragon, and is the origin, power [life], and strength  of all heresy, especially of that of the Papacy and Mahomet.  Therefore we ought and must constantly maintain this point,  that God does not wish to deal with us otherwise than through  the spoken Word and the Sacraments. It is the devil himself  whatsoever is extolled as Spirit without the Word and  Sacraments. For God wished to appear even to Moses through the  burning bush and spoken Word; and no prophet neither Elijah  nor Elisha, received the Spirit without the Ten Commandments  [or spoken Word]. Neither was John the Baptist conceived  without the preceding word of Gabriel, nor did he leap in his  mother's womb without the voice of Mary. And Peter says,  2. Ep. 1, 21: The prophecy came not by the will of man; but  holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.  Without the outward Word, however, they were not holy, much  less would the Holy Ghost have moved them to speak when they  still were unholy [or profane]; for they were holy, says he,  since the Holy Ghost spake through them.    IX. Of Excommunication.    The greater excommunication, as the Pope calls it, we regard  only as a civil penalty, and it does not concern us ministers  of the Church. But the lesser, that is, the true Christian  excommunication, consists in this, that manifest and obstinate  sinners are not admitted to the Sacrament and other communion  of the Church until they amend their lives and avoid sin. And  ministers ought not to mingle secular punishments with this  ecclesiastical punishment, or excommunication.    X. Of Ordination and the Call.    If the bishops would be true bishops [would rightly discharge  their office], and would devote themselves to the Church and  the Gospel, it might be granted to them for the sake of love  and unity, but not from necessity, to ordain and confirm us  and our preachers; omitting, however, all comedies and  spectacular display [deceptions, absurdities, and appearances]  of unchristian [heathenish] parade and pomp. But because they  neither are, nor wish to be, true bishops, but worldly lords  and princes, who will neither preach, nor teach, nor baptize,  nor administer the Lord's Supper, nor perform any work or  office of the Church, and, moreover, persecute and condemn  those who discharge these functions, having been called to do  so, the Church ought not on their account to remain without  ministers [to be forsaken by or deprived of ministers].    Therefore, as the ancient examples of the Church and the  Fathers teach us, we ourselves will and ought to ordain  suitable persons to this office; and, even according to their  own laws, they have not the right to forbid or prevent us. For  their laws say that those ordained even by heretics should be  declared [truly] ordained and stay ordained [and that such  ordination must not be changed], as St. Jerome writes of the  Church at Alexandria, that at first it was governed in common  by priests and preachers, without bishops.    XI. Of the Marriage of Priests.    To prohibit marriage, and to burden the divine order of  priests with perpetual celibacy, they have had neither  authority nor right [they have done out of malice, without any  honest reason], but have acted like antichristian, tyrannical,  desperate scoundrels [have performed the work of antichrist,  of tyrants and the worst knaves], and have thereby caused all  kinds of horrible, abominable, innumerable sins of unchastity  [depraved lusts], in which they still wallow. Now, as little  as we or they have been given the power to make a woman out of  a man or a man out of a woman, or to nullify either sex, so  little have they had the power to [sunder and] separate such  creatures of God, or to forbid them from living [and  cohabiting] honestly in marriage with one another. Therefore  we are unwilling to assent to their abominable celibacy, nor  will we [even] tolerate it, but we wish to have"]]]
