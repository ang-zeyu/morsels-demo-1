It is sometimes valuable to have enough imagination to unlearn as well  as to learn. I would ask the reader to forget his reading and everything  that he learnt at school, and consider the English monarchy as it would  then appear to him. Let him suppose that his acquaintance with the  ancient kings has only come to him as it came to most men in simpler  times, from nursery tales, from the names of places, from the  dedications of churches and charities, from the tales in the tavern, and  the tombs in the churchyard. Let us suppose such a person going upon  some open and ordinary English way, such as the Thames valley to  Windsor, or visiting some old seats of culture, such as Oxford or  Cambridge. One of the first things, for instance, he would find would  be Eton, a place transformed, indeed, by modern aristocracy, but still  enjoying its mediaeval wealth and remembering its mediaeval origin. If he  asked about that origin, it is probable that even a public schoolboy  would know enough history to tell him that it was founded by Henry VI.  If he went to Cambridge and looked with his own eyes for the college  chapel which artistically towers above all others like a cathedral, he  would probably ask about it, and be told it was King's College. If he  asked which king, he would again be told Henry VI. If he then went into  the library and looked up Henry VI. in an encyclopaedia, he would find  that the legendary giant, who had left these gigantic works behind him,  was in history an almost invisible pigmy. Amid the varying and  contending numbers of a great national quarrel, he is the only cipher.  The contending factions carry him about like a bale of goods. His  desires do not seem to be even ascertained, far less satisfied. And yet  his real desires are satisfied in stone and marble, in oak and gold, and  remain through all the maddest revolutions of modern England, while all  the ambitions of those who dictated to him have gone away like dust upon  the wind.    Edward the Confessor, like Henry VI., was not only an invalid but almost  an idiot. It is said that he was wan like an albino, and that the awe  men had of him was partly that which is felt for a monster of mental  deficiency. His Christian charity was of the kind that borders on  anarchism, and the stories about him recall the Christian fools in the  great anarchic novels of Russia. Thus he is reported to have covered the  retreat of a common thief upon the naked plea that the thief needed  things more than he did. Such a story is in strange contrast to the  claims made for other kings, that theft was impossible in their  dominions. Yet the two types of king are afterwards praised by the same  people; and the really arresting fact is that the incompetent king is  praised the more highly of the two. And exactly as in the case of the  last Lancastrian, we find that the praise has really a very practical  meaning in the long run. When we turn from the destructive to the  constructive side of the Middle Ages we find that the village idiot is  the inspiration of cities and civic systems. We find his seal upon the  sacred foundations of Westminster Abbey. We find the Norman victors in  the hour of victory bowing before his very ghost. In the Tapestry of  Bayeux, woven by Norman hands to justify the Norman cause and glorify  the Norman triumph, nothing is claimed for the Conqueror beyond his  conquest and the plain personal tale that excuses it, and the story  abruptly ends with the breaking of the Saxon line at Battle. But over  the bier of the decrepit zany, who died without striking a blow, over  this and this alone, is shown a hand coming out of heaven, and declaring  the true approval of the power that rules the world.    The Confessor, therefore, is a paradox in many ways, and in none more  than in the false reputation of the \"English\" of that day. As I have  indicated, there is some unreality in talking about the Anglo-Saxon at  all. The Anglo-Saxon is a mythical and straddling giant, who has  presumably left one footprint in England and the other in Saxony. But  there was a community, or rather group of communities, living in Britain  before the Conquest under what we call Saxon names, and of a blood  probably more Germanic and certainly less French than the same  communities after the Conquest. And they have a modern reputation which  is exactly the reverse of their real one. The value of the Anglo-Saxon  is exaggerated, and yet his virtues are ignored. Our Anglo-Saxon blood  is supposed to be the practical part of us; but as a fact the  Anglo-Saxons were more hopelessly unpractical than any Celt. Their  racial influence is supposed to be healthy, or, what many think the same  thing, heathen. But as a fact these \"Teutons\" were the mystics. The  Anglo-Saxons did one thing, and one thing only, thoroughly well, as they  were fitted to do it thoroughly well. They christened England. Indeed,  they christened it before it was born. The one thing the Angles  obviously and certainly could not manage to do was to become English.  But they did become Christians, and indeed showed a particular  disposition to become monks. Moderns who talk vaguely of them as our  hardy ancestors never do justice to the real good they did us, by thus  opening our history, as it were, with the fable of an age of innocence,  and beginning all our chronicles, as so many chronicles began, with the  golden initial of a saint. By becoming monks they served us in many very  valuable and special capacities, but not notably, perhaps, in the  capacity of ancestors.    Along the northern coast of France, where the Confessor had passed his  early life, lay the lands of one of the most powerful of the French  king's vassals, the Duke of Normandy. He and his people, who constitute  one of the most picturesque and curious elements in European history,  are confused for most of us by irrelevant controversies which would have  been entirely unintelligible to them. The worst of these is the inane  fiction which gives the name of Norman to the English aristocracy during  its great period of the last three hundred years. Tennyson informed a  lady of the name of Vere de Vere that simple faith was more valuable  than Norman blood. But the historical student who can believe in Lady  Clara as the possessor of the Norman blood must be himself a large  possessor of the simple faith. As a matter of fact, as we shall see also  when we come to the political scheme of the Normans, the notion is the  negation of their real importance in history. The fashionable fancy  misses what was best in the Normans, exactly as we have found it missing  what was best in the Saxons. One does not know whether to thank the  Normans more for appearing or for disappearing. Few philanthropists  ever became so rapidly anonymous. It is the great glory of the Norman  adventurer that he threw himself heartily into his chance position; and  had faith not only in his comrades, but in his subjects, and even in his  enemies. He was loyal to the kingdom he had not yet made. Thus the  Norman Bruce becomes a Scot; thus the descendant of the Norman Strongbow  becomes an Irishman. No men less than Normans can be conceived as  remaining as a superior caste until the present time. But this alien and  adventurous loyalty in the Norman, which appears in these other national  histories, appears most strongly of all in the history we have here to  follow. The Duke of Normandy does become a real King of England; his  claim through the Confessor, his election by the Council, even his  symbolic handfuls of the soil of Sussex, these are not altogether empty  forms. And though both phrases would be inaccurate, it is very much  nearer the truth to call William the first of the English than to call  Harold the last of them.    An indeterminate debate touching the dim races that mixed without record  in that dim epoch, has made much of the fact that the Norman edges of  France, like the East Anglian edges of England, were deeply penetrated  by the Norse invasions of the ninth century; and that the ducal house of  Normandy, with what other families we know not, can be traced back to a  Scandinavian seed. The unquestionable power of captaincy and creative  legislation which belonged to the Normans, whoever they were, may be  connected reasonably enough with some infusion of fresh blood. But if  the racial theorists press the point to a comparison of races, it can  obviously only be answered by a study of the two types in separation.  And it must surely be manifest that more civilizing power has since been  shown by the French when untouched by Scandinavian blood than by the  Scandinavians when untouched by French blood. As much fighting (and more  ruling) was done by the Crusaders who were never Vikings as by the  Vikings who were never Crusaders. But in truth there is no need of such  invidious analysis; we may willingly allow a real value to the  Scandinavian contribution to the French as to the English nationality,  so long as we firmly understand the ultimate historic fact that the  duchy of Normandy was about as Scandinavian as the town of Norwich. But  the debate has another danger, in that it tends to exaggerate even the  personal importance of the Norman. Many as were his talents as a master,  he is in history the servant of other and wider things. The landing of  Lanfranc is perhaps more of a date than the landing of William. And  Lanfranc was an Italian--like Julius Caesar. The Norman is not in history  a mere wall, the rather brutal boundary of a mere empire. The Norman is  a gate. He is like one of those gates which still remain as he made  them, with round arch and rude pattern and stout supporting columns; and  what entered by that gate was civilization. William of Falaise has in  history a title much higher than that of Duke of Normandy or King of  England. He was what Julius Caesar was, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/209"],[0,"The Turn of the Screw (#7)"],[1,"nt; then I brought out: \"Go to  church. Goodbye. I must watch.\"    Slowly she faced me again. \"Do you fear for them?\"    We met in another long look. \"Don't YOU?\" Instead of answering she came  nearer to the window and, for a minute, applied her face to the glass.  \"You see how he could see,\" I meanwhile went on.    She didn't move. \"How long was he here?\"    \"Till I came out. I came to meet him.\"    Mrs. Grose at last turned round, and there was still more in her face.  \"_I_ couldn't have come out.\"    \"Neither could I!\" I laughed again. \"But I did come. I have my duty.\"    \"So have I mine,\" she replied; after which she added: \"What is he like?\"    \"I've been dying to tell you. But he's like nobody.\"    \"Nobody?\" she echoed.    \"He has no hat.\" Then seeing in her face that she already, in this, with  a deeper dismay, found a touch of picture, I quickly added stroke to  stroke. \"He has red hair, very red, close-curling, and a pale face, long  in shape, with straight, good features and little, rather queer whiskers  that are as red as his hair. His eyebrows are, somehow, darker; they  look particularly arched and as if they might move a good deal. His eyes  are sharp, strange--awfully; but I only know clearly that they're rather  small and very fixed. His mouth's wide, and his lips are thin, and  except for his little whiskers he's quite clean-shaven. He gives me a  sort of sense of looking like an actor.\"    \"An actor!\" It was impossible to resemble one less, at least, than Mrs.  Grose at that moment.    \"I've never seen one, but so I suppose them. He's tall, active, erect,\"  I continued, \"but never--no, never!--a gentleman.\"    My companion's face had blanched as I went on; her round eyes started  and her mild mouth gaped. \"A gentleman?\" she gasped, confounded,  stupefied: \"a gentleman HE?\"    \"You know him then?\"    She visibly tried to hold herself. \"But he IS handsome?\"    I saw the way to help her. \"Remarkably!\"    \"And dressed--?\"    \"In somebody's clothes.\" \"They're smart, but they're not his own.\"    She broke into a breathless affirmative groan: \"They're the master's!\"    I caught it up. \"You DO know him?\"    She faltered but a second. \"Quint!\" she cried.    \"Quint?\"    \"Peter Quint--his own man, his valet, when he was here!\"    \"When the master was?\"    Gaping still, but meeting me, she pieced it all together. \"He never wore  his hat, but he did wear--well, there were waistcoats missed. They were  both here--last year. Then the master went, and Quint was alone.\"    I followed, but halting a little. \"Alone?\"    \"Alone with US.\" Then, as from a deeper depth, \"In charge,\" she added.    \"And what became of him?\"    She hung fire so long that I was still more mystified. \"He went, too,\"  she brought out at last.    \"Went where?\"    Her expression, at this, became extraordinary. \"God knows where! He  died.\"    \"Died?\" I almost shrieked.    She seemed fairly to square herself, plant herself more firmly to utter  the wonder of it. \"Yes. Mr. Quint is dead.\"          VI      It took of course more than that particular passage to place us together  in presence of what we had now to live with as we could--my dreadful  liability to impressions of the order so vividly exemplified, and my  companion's knowledge, henceforth--a knowledge half consternation and  half compassion--of that liability. There had been, this evening, after  the revelation left me, for an hour, so prostrate--there had been, for  either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of tears  and vows, of prayers and promises, a climax to the series of mutual  challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our retreating  together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there to have  everything out. The result of our having everything out was simply to  reduce our situation to the last rigor of its elements. She herself had  seen nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and nobody in the house but  the governess was in the governess's plight; yet she accepted without  directly impugning my sanity the truth as I gave it to her, and ended by  showing me, on this ground, an awestricken tenderness, an expression  of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of which the very  breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of human charities.    What was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we  thought we might bear things together; and I was not even sure that,  in spite of her exemption, it was she who had the best of the burden. I  knew at this hour, I think, as well as I knew later, what I was capable  of meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly  sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so  compromising a contract. I was queer company enough--quite as queer as  the company I received; but as I trace over what we went through I see  how much common ground we must have found in the one idea that, by good  fortune, COULD steady us. It was the idea, the second movement, that led  me straight out, as I may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. I could  take the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs. Grose could join me.  Perfectly can I recall now the particular way strength came to me before  we separated for the night. We had gone over and over every feature of  what I had seen.    \"He was looking for someone else, you say--someone who was not you?\"    \"He was looking for little Miles.\" A portentous clearness now possessed  me. \"THAT'S whom he was looking for.\"    \"But how do you know?\"    \"I know, I know, I know!\" My exaltation grew. \"And YOU know, my dear!\"    She didn't deny this, but I required, I felt, not even so much telling  as that. She resumed in a moment, at any rate: \"What if HE should see  him?\"    \"Little Miles? That's what he wants!\"    She looked immensely scared again. \"The child?\"    \"Heaven forbid! The man. He wants to appear to THEM.\" That he might was  an awful conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at bay; which,  moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in practically  proving. I had an absolute certainty that I should see again what I  had already seen, but something within me said that by offering myself  bravely as the sole subject of such experience, by accepting, by  inviting, by surmounting it all, I should serve as an expiatory victim  and guard the tranquility of my companions. The children, in especial,  I should thus fence about and absolutely save. I recall one of the last  things I said that night to Mrs. Grose.    \"It does strike me that my pupils have never mentioned--\"    She looked at me hard as I musingly pulled up. \"His having been here and  the time they were with him?\"    \"The time they were with him, and his name, his presence, his history,  in any way.\"    \"Oh, the little lady doesn't remember. She never heard or knew.\"    \"The circumstances of his death?\" I thought with some intensity.  \"Perhaps not. But Miles would remember--Miles would know.\"    \"Ah, don't try him!\" broke from Mrs. Grose.    I returned her the look she had given me. \"Don't be afraid.\" I continued  to think. \"It IS rather odd.\"    \"That he has never spoken of him?\"    \"Never by the least allusion. And you tell me they were 'great  friends'?\"    \"Oh, it wasn't HIM!\" Mrs. Grose with emphasis declared. \"It was Quint's  own fancy. To play with him, I mean--to spoil him.\" She paused a moment;  then she added: \"Quint was much too free.\"    This gave me, straight from my vision of his face--SUCH a face!--a  sudden sickness of disgust. \"Too free with MY boy?\"    \"Too free with everyone!\"    I forbore, for the moment, to analyze this description further than by  the reflection that a part of it applied to several of the members of  the household, of the half-dozen maids and men who were still of our  small colony. But there was everything, for our apprehension, in the  lucky fact that no discomfortable legend, no perturbation of scullions,  had ever, within anyone's memory attached to the kind old place. It had  neither bad name nor ill fame, and Mrs. Grose, most apparently, only  desired to cling to me and to quake in silence. I even put her, the very  last thing of all, to the test. It was when, at midnight, she had her  hand on the schoolroom door to take leave. \"I have it from you then--for  it's of great importance--that he was definitely and admittedly bad?\"    \"Oh, not admittedly. _I_ knew it--but the master didn't.\"    \"And you never told him?\"    \"Well, he didn't like tale-bearing--he hated complaints. He was terribly  short with anything of that kind, and if people were all right to HIM--\"    \"He wouldn't be bothered with more?\" This squared well enough with my  impressions of him: he was not a trouble-loving gentleman, nor so very  particular perhaps about some of the company HE kept. All the same, I  pressed my interlocutress. \"I promise you _I_ would have told!\"    She felt my discrimination. \"I daresay I was wrong. But, really, I was  afraid.\"    \"Afraid of what?\"    \"Of things that man could do. Quint was so clever--he was so deep.\"    I took this in still more than, probably, I showed. \"You weren't afraid  of anything else? Not of his effect--?\"    \"His effect?\" she repeated with a face of anguish and waiting while I  faltered.    \"On innocent little precious lives. They were in your charge.\"    \"No, they were not in mine!\" she roundly and distressfully returned.  \"The master believed in him and placed him here because he was supposed  not to be well and the country air so good for him. So he had everything  to say. Yes\"--she let me have it--\"even about THEM.\"    \"Them--that creature?\" I had to smother a kind of howl. \"And you could  bear it!\"    \"No. I couldn't--and I can't now!\" And the poor woman burst into tears.    A rigid control, from the next day, was, as I have said, to follow them;  yet how often and how passionately, for a week, we came back together  to the subject! Much as we had discussed it"]]]
