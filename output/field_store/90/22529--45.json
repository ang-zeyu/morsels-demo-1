At his taking off and landing     I could see his scarlet nostril and his mighty ribs expanding,     And the Ace stretched out in earnest and we held him stride for stride.       But the pace was so terrific that they soon ran out their tether --     They were rolling in their gallop, they were fairly blown and beat --     But they both were game as pebbles -- neither one would show the feather.     And we rushed them at the fences, and they cleared them both together,     Nearly every time they clouted, but they somehow kept their feet.       Then the last jump rose before us, and they faced it game as ever --     We were both at spur and whipcord, fetching blood at every bound --     And above the people's cheering and the cries of 'Ace' and 'Quiver',     I could hear the trainer shouting, 'One more run for Snowy River.'     Then we struck the jump together and came smashing to the ground.       Well, the Quiver ran to blazes, but the Ace stood still and waited,     Stood and waited like a statue while I scrambled on his back.     There was no one next or near me for the field was fairly slated,     So I cantered home a winner with my shoulder dislocated,     While the man that rode the Quiver followed limping down the track.       And he shook my hand and told me that in all his days he never     Met a man who rode more gamely, and our last set to was prime,     And we wired them on Monaro how we chanced to beat the Quiver.     And they sent us back an answer, 'Good old sort from Snowy River:     Send us word each race you start in and we'll back you every time.'          The Amateur Rider           _HIM_ going to ride for us!  _HIM_ --       with the pants and the eyeglass and all.     Amateur! don't he just look it -- it's twenty to one on a fall.     Boss must be gone off his head to be sending our steeplechase crack     Out over fences like these with an object like that on his back.       Ride!  Don't tell _ME_ he can ride.       With his pants just as loose as balloons,     How can he sit on his horse? and his spurs like a pair of harpoons;     Ought to be under the Dog Act, he ought, and be kept off the course.     Fall! why, he'd fall off a cart, let alone off a steeplechase horse.           .   .   .   .   .       Yessir! the 'orse is all ready -- I wish you'd have rode him before;     Nothing like knowing your 'orse, sir, and this chap's a terror to bore;     Battleaxe always could pull, and he rushes his fences like fun --     Stands off his jump twenty feet, and then springs like a shot from a gun.       Oh, he can jump 'em all right, sir, you make no mistake, 'e's a toff;     Clouts 'em in earnest, too, sometimes,       you mind that he don't clout you off --     Don't seem to mind how he hits 'em, his shins is as hard as a nail,     Sometimes you'll see the fence shake       and the splinters fly up from the rail.       All you can do is to hold him and just let him jump as he likes,     Give him his head at the fences, and hang on like death if he strikes;     Don't let him run himself out -- you can lie third or fourth in the race --     Until you clear the stone wall, and from that you can put on the pace.       Fell at that wall once, he did, and it gave him a regular spread,     Ever since that time he flies it -- he'll stop if you pull at his head,     Just let him race -- you can trust him --       he'll take first-class care he don't fall,     And I think that's the lot -- but remember,       _HE MUST HAVE HIS HEAD AT THE WALL_.           .   .   .   .   .       Well, he's down safe as far as the start,       and he seems to sit on pretty neat,     Only his baggified breeches would ruinate anyone's seat --     They're away -- here they come -- the first fence,       and he's head over heels for a crown!     Good for the new chum, he's over, and two of the others are down!       Now for the treble, my hearty -- By Jove, he can ride, after all;     Whoop, that's your sort -- let him fly them!       He hasn't much fear of a fall.     Who in the world would have thought it?  And aren't they just going a pace?     Little Recruit in the lead there will make it a stoutly-run race.       Lord!  But they're racing in earnest -- and down goes Recruit on his head,     Rolling clean over his boy -- it's a miracle if he ain't dead.     Battleaxe, Battleaxe, yet!  By the Lord, he's got most of 'em beat --     Ho! did you see how he struck, and the swell never moved in his seat?       Second time round, and, by Jingo! he's holding his lead of 'em well;     Hark to him clouting the timber!  It don't seem to trouble the swell.     Now for the wall -- let him rush it.  A thirty-foot leap, I declare --     Never a shift in his seat, and he's racing for home like a hare.       What's that that's chasing him -- Rataplan -- regular demon to stay!     Sit down and ride for your life now!       Oh, good, that's the style -- come away!     Rataplan's certain to beat you, unless you can give him the slip;     Sit down and rub in the whalebone now -- give him the spurs and the whip!       Battleaxe, Battleaxe, yet -- and it's Battleaxe wins for a crown;     Look at him rushing the fences, he wants to bring t'other chap down.     Rataplan never will catch him if only he keeps on his pins;     Now! the last fence! and he's over it!  Battleaxe, Battleaxe wins!           .   .   .   .   .       Well, sir, you rode him just perfect --       I knew from the first you could ride.     Some of the chaps said you couldn't, an' I says just like this a' one side:     Mark me, I says, that's a tradesman -- the saddle is where he was bred.     Weight! you're all right, sir, and thank you;       and them was the words that I said.          On Kiley's Run           The roving breezes come and go                    On Kiley's Run,     The sleepy river murmurs low,     And far away one dimly sees     Beyond the stretch of forest trees --     Beyond the foothills dusk and dun --     The ranges sleeping in the sun                    On Kiley's Run.       'Tis many years since first I came                    To Kiley's Run,     More years than I would care to name     Since I, a stripling, used to ride     For miles and miles at Kiley's side,     The while in stirring tones he told     The stories of the days of old                    On Kiley's Run.       I see the old bush homestead now                    On Kiley's Run,     Just nestled down beneath the brow     Of one small ridge above the sweep     Of river-flat, where willows weep     And jasmine flowers and roses bloom,     The air was laden with perfume                    On Kiley's Run.       We lived the good old station life                    On Kiley's Run,     With little thought of care or strife.     Old Kiley seldom used to roam,     He liked to make the Run his home,     The swagman never turned away     With empty hand at close of day                    From Kiley's Run.       We kept a racehorse now and then                    On Kiley's Run,     And neighb'ring stations brought their men     To meetings where the sport was free,     And dainty ladies came to see     Their champions ride; with laugh and song     The old house rang the whole night long                    On Kiley's Run.       The station hands were friends I wot                    On Kiley's Run,     A reckless, merry-hearted lot --     All splendid riders, and they knew     The 'boss' was kindness through and through.     Old Kiley always stood their friend,     And so they served him to the end                    On Kiley's Run.       But droughts and losses came apace                    To Kiley's Run,     Till ruin stared him in the face;     He toiled and toiled while lived the light,     He dreamed of overdrafts at night:     At length, because he could not pay,     His bankers took the stock away                    From Kiley's Run.       Old Kiley stood and saw them go                    From Kiley's Run.     The well-bred cattle marching slow;     His stockmen, mates for many a day,     They wrung his hand and went away.     Too old to make another start,     Old Kiley died -- of broken heart,                    On Kiley's Run.           .   .   .   .   .       The owner lives in England now                    Of Kiley's Run.     He knows a racehorse from a cow;     But that is all he knows of stock:     His chiefest care is how to dock     Expenses, and he sends from town     To cut the shearers' wages down                    On Kiley's Run.       There are no neighbours anywhere                    Near Kiley's Run.     The hospitable homes are bare,     The gardens gone; for no pretence     Must hinder cutting down expense:     The homestead that we held so dear     Contains a half-paid overseer                    On Kiley's Run.       All life and sport and hope have died                    On Kiley's Run.     No longer there the stockmen ride;     For sour-faced boundary riders creep     On mongrel horses after sheep,     Through ranges where, at racing speed,     Old Kiley used to 'wheel the lead'                    On Kiley's Run.       There runs a lane for thirty miles                    Through Kiley's Run.     On either side the herbage smiles,     But wretched trav'lling sheep must pass     Without a drink or blade of grass     Thro' that long lane of death and shame:     The weary drovers curse the name                    Of Kiley's Run.       The name itself is changed of late                    Of Kiley's Run.     They call it 'Chandos Park Estate'.     The lonely swagman through the dark     Must hump his swag past Chandos Park.     The name is English, don't you see,     The old name sweeter sounds to me                    Of 'Kiley's Run'.       I cannot guess what fate will bring                    To Kiley's Run --     For chances come and changes ring --     I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21300"],[0,"Cowboy Songs, and Other Frontier Ballads (#7)"],[1,"hell.          DAN TAYLOR        Dan Taylor is a rollicking cuss,    A frisky son of a gun,    He loves to court the maidens    And he savies how it's done.      He used to be a cowboy    And they say he wasn't slow,    He could ride the bucking bronco    And swing the long lasso.      He could catch a maverick by the head    Or heel him on the fly,    He could pick up his front ones    Whenever he chose to try.      He used to ride most anything;    Now he seldom will.    He says they cut some caper in the air    Of which he's got his fill.      He is done and quit the business,    Settled down to quiet life,    And he's hunting for some maiden    Who will be his little wife,--      One who will wash and patch his britches    And feed the setting hen,    Milk old Blue and Brindy,    And tend to baby Ben.      Then he'll build a cozy cottage    And furnish it complete,    He'll decorate the walls inside    With pictures new and sweet.      He will leave off riding broncos    And be a different man;    He will do his best to please his wife    In every way he can.      Then together in double harness    They will trot along down the line,    Until death shall call them over    To a bright and sunny clime.

WHEN WORK IS DONE THIS FALL        A group of jolly cowboys, discussing plans at ease,    Says one, \"I'll tell you something, boys, if you will listen, please.    I am an old cow-puncher and here I'm dressed in rags,    And I used to be a tough one and take on great big jags.      \"But I've got a home, boys, a good one, you all know,    Although I have not seen it since long, long ago.    I'm going back to Dixie once more to see them all;    Yes, I'm going to see my mother when the work's all done this fall.      \"After the round-ups are over and after the shipping is done,    I am going right straight home, boys, ere all my money is gone.    I have changed my ways, boys, no more will I fall;    And I am going home, boys, when work is done this fall.      \"When I left home, boys, my mother for me cried,    Begged me not to go, boys, for me she would have died;    My mother's heart is breaking, breaking for me, that's all,    And with God's help I'll see her when the work's all done this fall.\"      That very night this cowboy went out to stand his guard;    The night was dark and cloudy and storming very hard;    The cattle they got frightened and rushed in wild stampede,    The cowboy tried to head them, riding at full speed.      While riding in the darkness so loudly did he shout,    Trying his best to head them and turn the herd about,    His saddle horse did stumble and on him did fall,    The poor boy won't see his mother when the work's all done this fall.      His body was so mangled the boys all thought him dead,    They picked him up so gently and laid him on a bed;    He opened wide his blue eyes and looking all around    He motioned to his comrades to sit near him on the ground.      \"Boys, send mother my wages, the wages I have earned,    For I'm afraid, boys, my last steer I have turned.    I'm going to a new range, I hear my Master's call,    And I'll not see my mother when the work's all done this fall.      \"Fred, you take my saddle; George, you take my bed;    Bill, you take my pistol after I am dead,    And think of me kindly when you look upon them all,    For I'll not see my mother when work is done this fall.\"      Poor Charlie was buried at sunrise, no tombstone at his head,    Nothing but a little board and this is what it said,    \"Charlie died at daybreak, he died from a fall,    And he'll not see his mother when the work's all done this fall.\"          SIOUX INDIANS        I'll sing you a song, though it may be a sad one,    Of trials and troubles and where they first begun;    I left my dear kindred, my friends, and my home,    Across the wild deserts and mountains to roam.      I crossed the Missouri and joined a large train    Which bore us over mountain and valley and plain;    And often of evenings out hunting we'd go    To shoot the fleet antelope and wild buffalo.      We heard of Sioux Indians all out on the plains    A-killing poor drivers and burning their trains,--    A-killing poor drivers with arrows and bow,    When captured by Indians no mercy they show.      We traveled three weeks till we came to the Platte    And pitched out our tents at the end of the flat,    We spread down our blankets on the green grassy ground,    While our horses and mules were grazing around.      While taking refreshment we heard a low yell,    The whoop of Sioux Indians coming up from the dell;    We sprang to our rifles with a flash in each eye,    \"Boys,\" says our brave leader, \"we'll fight till we die.\"      They made a bold dash and came near to our train    And the arrows fell around us like hail and like rain,    But with our long rifles we fed them cold lead    Till many a brave warrior around us lay dead.      We shot their bold chief at the head of his band.    He died like a warrior with a gun in his hand.    When they saw their bold chief lying dead in his gore,    They whooped and they yelled and we saw them no more.      With our small band,--there were just twenty-four,--    And the Sioux Indians there were five hundred or more,--    We fought them with courage; we spoke not a word,    Till the end of the battle was all that was heard.      We hitched up our horses and we started our train;    Three more bloody battles this trip on the plain;    And in our last battle three of our brave boys fell,    And we left them to rest in a green, shady dell.          THE OLD CHISHOLM TRAIL        Come along, boys, and listen to my tale,    I'll tell you of my troubles on the old Chisholm trail.          Coma ti yi youpy, youpy ya, youpy ya,        Coma ti yi youpy, youpy ya.      I started up the trail October twenty-third,    I started up the trail with the 2-U herd.      Oh, a ten dollar hoss and a forty dollar saddle,--    And I'm goin' to punchin' Texas cattle.      I woke up one morning on the old Chisholm trail,    Rope in my hand and a cow by the tail.      I'm up in the mornin' afore daylight    And afore I sleep the moon shines bright.      Old Ben Bolt was a blamed good boss,    But he'd go to see the girls on a sore-backed hoss.      Old Ben Bolt was a fine old man    And you'd know there was whiskey wherever he'd land.      My hoss throwed me off at the creek called Mud,    My hoss throwed me off round the 2-U herd.      Last time I saw him he was going cross the level    A-kicking up his heels and a-running like the devil.      It's cloudy in the West, a-looking like rain,    And my damned old slicker's in the wagon again.      Crippled my hoss, I don't know how,    Ropin' at the horns of a 2-U cow.      We hit Caldwell and we hit her on the fly,    We bedded down the cattle on the hill close by.      No chaps, no slicker, and it's pouring down rain,    And I swear, by god, I'll never night-herd again.      Feet in the stirrups and seat in the saddle,    I hung and rattled with them long-horn cattle.      Last night I was on guard and the leader broke the ranks,    I hit my horse down the shoulders and I spurred him in the flanks.      The wind commenced to blow, and the rain began to fall,    Hit looked, by grab, like we was goin' to loss 'em all.      I jumped in the saddle and grabbed holt the horn,    Best blamed cow-puncher ever was born.      I popped my foot in the stirrup and gave a little yell,    The tail cattle broke and the leaders went to hell.      I don't give a damn if they never do stop;    I'll ride as long as an eight-day clock.      Foot in the stirrup and hand on the horn,    Best damned cowboy ever was born.      I herded and I hollered and I done very well,    Till the boss said, \"Boys, just let 'em go to hell.\"      Stray in the herd and the boss said kill it,    So I shot him in the rump with the handle of the skillet.      We rounded 'em up and put 'em on the cars,    And that was the last of the old Two Bars.      Oh it's bacon and beans most every day,--    I'd as soon be a-eatin' prairie hay.      I'm on my best horse and I'm goin' at a run,    I'm the quickest shootin' cowboy that ever pulled a gun.      I went to the wagon to get my roll,    To come back to Texas, dad-burn my soul.      I went to the boss to draw my roll,    He had it figgered out I was nine dollars in the hole.      I'll sell my outfit just as soon as I can,    I won't punch cattle for no damned man.      Goin' back to town to draw my money,    Goin' back home to see my honey.      With my knees in the saddle and my seat in the sky,    I'll quit punching cows in the sweet by and by.

JACK DONAHOO        Come, all you bold, undaunted men,    You outlaws of the day,    It's time to beware of the ball and chain    And also slavery.    Attention pay to what I say,    And verily if you do,    I will relate you the actual fate    Of bold Jack Donahoo.      He had scarcely landed, as I tell you,    Upon Australia's shore,    Than he became a real highwayman,    As he had been before.    There was Underwood and Mackerman,    And Wade and Westley too,    These were the four associates    Of bold Jack Donahoo.      Jack Donahoo, who was so brave,    Rode out that afternoon,    Knowing not that the pain of death    Would overtake him soon.    So quickly then the horse police    From Sidney came to view;    \"Begone from here, you cowardly dogs,\"    Says bold Jack Donahoo.      The captain and the sergeant "]]]
