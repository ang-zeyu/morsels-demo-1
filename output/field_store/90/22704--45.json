Their own education was not neglected. Twice daily lectures were given  in the saloon--usually in the presence of the Brigadier. Lecturers were  detailed in turn and the subjects were varied. On the whole the lectures  were good. A few fell short of what was required, but usually the  discussion which followed such effort made up for any defect in the  lecture itself. Occasional flashes of unconscious humour often saved the  indifferent performer from boring his audience.    Duties absorbed a platoon or more daily. Guards had to be found to  provide sentries to give the alarm in case of fire, accident, or  collision. Police were detailed to see that the orders designed to  prevent outbreaks of fire or disease were observed. Sweepers and  swabbers cleaned down the decks twice in every 24 hours. Stable picquets  looked after the horse deck. Mess orderlies saw to the drawing of  rations, serving of meals, and cleansing of mess utensils. On entering  the tropics the ship's captain asked for volunteers for work in the coal  bunkers. His crew was hard pressed. These volunteers were forthcoming  and for their services received extra pay.    Within a few hours of leaving Fremantle no less than seven stowaways  were found. The first discovered was a small lad, dressed in the uniform  of the military cadets, who said his age was 17 years. He gave his name  and address as Herbert Hamilton, of Midland Junction, and, when brought  before the C.O., manfully expressed his desire to serve in the army. By  means of the wireless telegraph his parents were communicated with and  their consent to his enlistment obtained. As the Battalion was already  at full strength, Hamilton was taken on the roll of the Queensland  infantry. For a time the Brigadier took him under his personal care, but  after Gallipoli he joined his unit and did good service with it  throughout the remainder of the war. The balance of the stowaways were  men from Blackboy Camp. One or two had been discharged from service  there and merely wanted to \"get away.\" They were given work in the ship.  The others were anxious to serve and, after examination, were also taken  on by the 26th Battalion. In addition to stowaways four men had been  taken on board who belonged to the 27th Battalion and had failed to  re-embark on the departure of the \"Geelong\" from Fremantle.    After the first few days the routine of the ship went very smoothly.  Eight N.C.Os., appointed Troop Deck Sergeants, were responsible for the  cleanliness and order of their respective quarters. Satisfactory results  were thus obtained. Competition in regard to the best kept mess was  keen. Utensils were polished like silver and arranged in designs that  often displayed much originality on the part of the mess orderlies. \"A\"  Company gained especial credit in this respect.    Discipline remained good, the only offences being minor ones. The food  provided was, now and then, a cause for complaint. In the first place  the scale laid down by the Imperial authorities was inadequate to  satisfy the appetites of a meat-eating race like the Australians.  Secondly, the method of cooking showed lack of knowledge on the part of  the ship's staff and was not economical. Add to these two factors the  want of experience on the part of the mess orderlies in equally dividing  up the food supplied them--then the occurrence of the complaints can be  easily understood.    The living quarters in the ship were well ventilated--additional  draughts of air being ensured by the free use of wind-sails and chutes.  This, and the regular exercise daily, together with the anticipation of  the life and work ahead, kept all ranks in good health and spirits.  Measles and influenza appeared a few days after the commencement of the  voyage and claimed 40 or 50 victims, but no serious results ensued. One  bugler contracted pneumonia, but was well on the way towards  convalescence before Suez was reached. A single mental case came under  notice, necessitating the placing of the subject under close observation  until he could be handed over to the care of the authorities at the port  of disembarkation. All ranks were inoculated against smallpox and  typhoid. Many of them developed \"arms\" and temperatures as a result and  were decidedly unwell for a few days.    In the tropics 50 per cent. of the troops were provided with deck  accommodation for sleeping purposes. The heat when nearing Aden, and  during the passage of the Red Sea, was intense, but all ranks bore it  well. As far as was possible the dress was adapted to the climatic  conditions--special precautions being taken to guard against sunstroke.  Unfortunately, one of the ship's crew succumbed. He was buried at sea,  the ship laying-to whilst the burial service was read by the chaplain. A  collection afterwards taken up on behalf of the widow was generously  contributed to and realised over L50.    One chaplain only had been allotted to the troops on the transport. This  was the Rev. J. H. Neild, of the Methodist denomination. He conducted  service twice daily on Sundays and spent many hours on the decks at  other times. He was particularly earnest in his endeavours to help, and  his efforts were universally appreciated. Very great regret was  expressed by all who had come in contact with him when, shortly after  reaching Egypt, his health became so impaired as to necessitate his  return to Australia.    [Illustration: H.M's AUSTRALIAN TRANSPORT A11 (\"ASCANIUS.\")  _Photo. lent by Mr. E. L. Mitchell, Perth._]    On so crowded a transport it was difficult to arrange satisfactorily for  amusements. However, the best possible was done under the circumstances.  Sports meetings were held once or twice a week. In most of the  competitions the Western Australians showed up well. The keenest  interest was displayed in the inter-unit tug-of-war, the final of  which was won, after an exciting struggle, by the team from \"D\" Company.  In boxing, the honours went to the Queenslanders of the 17th A.A.S.C.,  who produced several very good performers of medium and heavy weights.  Much laughter was engendered when, after the tea hour, the tyros donned  the gloves with one another. Several concerts were arranged and held on  or near the well-decks. Perhaps the most popular singer was the youthful  stowaway. The regimental band, conducted by Sergt. W. T. Hocking,  assisted at these functions. Endeavours had been made to form this  before leaving Blackboy Hill, but time permitted of little being done  beyond collecting a certain number of instruments. Once on the ship all  men who could play were invited to attend practice. Thus a nucleus was  formed. By the time that Suez was reached good progress had been made  and the band was in a promising condition. In Egypt, however, and later  in France, bands were not encouraged--having to be more or less shelved.  In 1917 their true value began to be understood, and every facility was  given to form and maintain such organisations.    For the individual of certain tastes other diversions existed beyond  attendance at concerts and athletic competitions. Card games were  played--\"bridge\" being the first favourite, but \"poker\" also having a  large following. Gambling was forbidden by the regulations.  Nevertheless, the usual veteran of other wars was found on board who was  prepared to initiate all who were tempted into _some_ of the mysteries  of \"banker\" or \"crown and anchor.\" This individual, however, met  discouragement from the ship's police who, whenever opportunity offered,  seized and confiscated his plant. \"Two-up\" and \"House\" were not then so  popular as they became a few months later.    For mascots, the friends of the Battalion had sent on board two or three  of the ring-necked parakeets, generally known as \"Twenty-eights.\" These  were made pets of during the voyage, but had either died or escaped  before its end.    An Australian Imperial Force Canteen was established on board. This  supplied pipes, tobacco, cigarettes, sweets, non-alcoholic drinks, and a  variety of other odds and ends, which could be purchased. The ship was  \"dry\"--that is, no spirits, wines, or beer were supposed to be available  to other than the ship's crew. This arrangement was in accordance with  the policy of the Australian Government and obtained on all sea  transports. Whilst the usual stimulant was thus missed by many who were  accustomed to it, on the whole the system in force did more good than  harm and was a considerable aid to the preservation of order and  comfort. So far as could be observed, the rule was strictly adhered to  on the \"Ascanius\"; nevertheless, the Commanding Officer, during his  morning inspections of the ship, was more than once heard to comment on  the absorbent capacity of the crew, as evidenced by the number of empty  ale and stout bottles cleared from their quarters.    In all that was done for the comfort and welfare of the troops, great  assistance was rendered by the Master of the ship and his officers.  Perhaps the Chief Officer was more concerned in protecting the interests  of his owners than of giving much latitude to the men who were in  transit. At times in early morn, and again late at night, his voice  could be heard in altercation with some unfortunate Australian, who had  surreptitiously made his bed in a forbidden area, or had violated some  other rule of the ship. He and his myrmidons were suspected of undue  zeal in impounding and placing in the ship's store any hammock, blanket,  or mess utensil, whose owner had momentarily left them unguarded on deck  or in some other open space. Later on, the articles so impounded were  shown as shortages in the ship's stores returned by the troops and had  to be paid for from the Battalion's funds. That Chief"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25428"],[0,"Anecdotes of Animals (#7)"],[1,"A gentleman who had taken an active part in the rebellion of 1715, after  the battle of Preston escaped into the West Highlands, where a lady, a  near relative, gave him a hiding-place. A faithful servant conducted him  to the mouth of a cave and gave him an abundant store of food. The  fugitive crept in at a low opening, dragging his stores along. When he  reached a wider and higher place, he found some obstacle before him. He  drew his dirk, but unwilling to strike, lest he might take the life of a  companion in hiding, he stooped down, and found a goat with her kid  stretched on the ground. He soon saw that the animal was in great pain,  and feeling her body and limbs, found that her leg was broken. He bound  it up with his garter, and offered her a share of the bread beside him;  but she put out her tongue, as if to tell him that her mouth was parched  with thirst. He gave her water, which she drank readily, and then ate  some bread. After midnight he ventured out of the cave. All was still.  He plucked an armful of grass and cut some tender twigs, which the goat  accepted with signs of great joy and thankfulness. The prisoner took a  great deal of comfort in having a living creature in his dungeon, and he  caressed and fed her tenderly. The man who was trusted to bring him  supplies fell sick; and when another tried to enter the cavern, the goat  furiously opposed him, presenting her horns in all directions, till the  fugitive, hearing a disturbance, came forward. The new attendant gave  the watchword, and so the prisoner knew he was all right. He spoke to  the goat, and she obeyed him, and allowed the servant to enter. The  gentleman was sure that had a band of soldiers attacked the cavern, his  grateful patient would have died in his defense.    [Illustration]          XLVII    FOX CHASING      During a fox hunt, Reynard, being hard pressed, had to take refuge up  the chimney of a hot house. He was followed by one of the hounds, who,  passing through a flue nearly fifty feet in length, came out at the top  of the chimney, but in some way missed Reynard in its dark recesses. By  this time a number of people were collected at the top of the chimney.  They let down a terrier, who, holding fast by his brush, soon drove him  out.    [Illustration]          XLVIII    THE RIGHTS OF HOSPITALITY      A native Moor who went to hunt the lion, having gone far into the  forest, happened to meet with two lion's cubs that came to caress him.  The hunter stopped with the little animals, and waiting for the coming  of the father or mother, took out his breakfast and gave them a part.  The lioness arrived unseen by the huntsman, so that he had not time, or  perhaps wanted the courage to take his gun. After having for some time  looked at the man that was thus feasting her young, the lioness went  away, and soon afterward returned, bearing with her a sheep, which she  laid at the huntsman's feet.    The Moor, thus become one of the family, took this occasion of making a  good meal, skinned the sheep, made a fire, and then roasted a part,  giving the entrails to the young. The lion in his turn came also; and,  as if respecting the rights of hospitality, he showed no tokens whatever  of ferocity. Their guest the next day, having finished his provisions,  returned, and resolved never more to kill any of those animals, the  noble generosity of which he had so fully proven. He stroked and  caressed the cubs at taking leave of them, and the mother and father  went with him till he was safely out of the forest.    [Illustration]          XLIX    A SLY COUPLE      A gentleman in the county of Stirling kept a greyhound and a pointer,  and being fond of coursing, the pointer was accustomed to find the  hares, and the greyhound to catch them. When the season was over, it was  found that the dogs were in the habit of going out by themselves, and  killing hares for their own amusement. To prevent this, a large iron  ring was fastened to the pointer's neck by a leather collar, and allowed  to hang down so as to prevent the dog from running or jumping over  ditches and dykes. The animals, however, continued to stroll out into  the fields together; and one day the gentleman, suspecting that they  were up to some sort of mischief, decided to watch them. To his  surprise, he found that the moment when they thought no one was looking  at them, the greyhound took up the iron ring in his mouth, and carrying  it, they set off to the hills, and began to search for hares as usual.  They were followed, and it was discovered that whenever the pointer  scented the hare, the ring was dropped, and the greyhound stood ready to  pounce upon the poor little creature the moment the other drove her from  her form, but that he always came back to help his friend after he had  caught his prey.    [Illustration]          L    OSTRICH RIDING      A gentleman tells how, during the time he was living at Podor, a French  factory on the banks of the river Niger, there were two ostriches,  though young, of gigantic size, which afforded him a very remarkable  sight. \"They were,\" he says, \"so tame that two little blacks mounted  both together on the back of the largest. No sooner did he feel their  weight, than he began to run as fast as possible, and carried them  several times round the village, as it was impossible to stop him  otherwise than by putting something in the path. This sight pleased me  so much, that I was anxious to have it repeated, and to try their  strength, directed a full-grown negro to mount the smaller and the two  boys the larger. This burden did not seem at all too much for their  strength. At first they went at a fairly sharp trot, but when they  became heated a little, they expanded their wings as though to catch the  wind, and moved with such fleetness that they scarcely seemed to touch  the ground. Most people have, at one time or another, seen a partridge  run; and therefore know that there is no man whatever able to keep up  with it; and it is easy to imagine, that if this bird had a longer step,  its speed would be much greater. The ostrich moves much like the  partridge, with this advantage; and I am satisfied that those I am  speaking of, would have distanced the fleetest racehorses that were ever  bred in England. It is true they would not hold out as long as a horse;  but they would undoubtedly go over a given space in less time. I have  often seen this performance, and it gives one an idea of the wonderful  strength of an ostrich, and shows of what use it might be, did we but  know how to break and manage it as we do a horse.\"    [Illustration]          LI    RETRIBUTION      A fawn that was drinking in a park, was suddenly pounced upon by one of  the swans, that pulled the animal into the water, and held it under till  it was drowned. This cruel deed was noticed by the other deer in the  park, and did not go long unrevenged; for shortly after this the very  swan, which had never till this time been molested by the deer, was  singled out when on land one day, and furiously attacked by the herd,  which closed around the cruel swan, and soon killed it.    [Illustration]          LII    AN ELEPHANT'S REVENGE      Persons who have the care of elephants have often noticed that they know  very well when any one is making fun of them, and that they very often  revenge themselves when they have an opportunity. A painter wished to  draw an elephant in the menagerie at Paris, and wanted to get the animal  in a ridiculous attitude, which was with his trunk lifted up and his  mouth open.    To make the elephant keep this position, an attendant threw fruit and  nuts into the open mouth, but sometimes he only pretended to throw them.  This made the animal very angry, and as if knowing that the painter  rather than his servant was the one to blame, he finally turned to him  and dashed a quantity of water from his trunk over the paper on which  the painter was sketching his portrait.    [Illustration]          LIII    STRANGE PLAYMATES      A little girl about three years of age was noticed for a number of days  going a considerable distance from the house with a piece of bread her  mother had given her. This attracted the attention of the mother, who  asked the father to follow the child, and find out what she did with the  bread. On coming to the child, he found her busy at work feeding several  snakes of the species of rattlesnakes called yellow heads. He quickly  took her away, went to the house for his gun, and returning, killed two  of them at one shot, and another a few days afterward. The child called  these snakes as you would call chickens, and when her father told her if  she let them come so near her, they would bite her, she replied, \"No,  they won't bite. They only eat the bread I give them.\"    [Illustration]          LIV    HONORS TO THE LIVING AND THE DEAD      The people of Athens, when they had finished the temple, called  _Hecatompedon_, set at liberty the beasts of burden that had been  chiefly engaged in that work, allowing them to pasture at large, free  from all further service. It is said that one of these animals afterward  came of its own accord to work, and putting itself at the head of the  laboring cattle, marched before them to the citadel. The people were  pleased with this action, and said that the animal should be kept at  public expense as long as it lived. Many people have shown particular  marks of regard in burying animals which they have cherished and been  fond of. The graves of Cimon's mares, with which he thrice conquered at  the Olympic games, are still to be seen near his own tomb. Xanthippus,  whose dog swam by the side of his galley to Salamis, when the Athenians  were forced to abandon their city, afterward buried it with great pomp  upon a promontory, which to this day is called the _Dog's Grave_. In  Pliny, we have an amusing account of a superb funeral ceremony, which  took place"]]]
