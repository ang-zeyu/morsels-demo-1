But as regards those  studies which are intended to open the way to professions essentially  bold and masculine in character, we do not see how it is within the  bounds of possibility for young women to move onward in that direction  without losing some of their most precious womanly  prerogatives--without, in short, unsexing themselves.    The really critical point with regard to the present position of women  in America is the question of work and wages. Here the pocket of man is  touched. And the pocket is the most sensitive point with many men, not  only in America, but all the world over. There can be no doubt whatever  that women are now driven away from certain occupations, to which they  are well adapted, by the selfishness of some men. And in many  departments where they are day-laborers for commercial firms they are  inadequately paid, and compelled to provide food, lodging, fuel, and  light out of scanty wages. Yes, we have here one of the few real  grievances of which American women have a just right to complain. But  even here--even where the pocket is directly touched, we still believe  that women may obtain full justice in the end, by pursuing the right  course. Only let the reality of the grievance be clearly proved, and  redress will follow, ere long. Providence has the power of bringing  good out of evil; and therefore we believe that the movement now going  on will here, at least, show some lasting results for good. The \"Song  of the Shirt\" shall, we trust, ere long become an obsolete lay in our  country. Our women, twenty years hence, shall be better paid in some of  their old fields of labor; and new openings, appropriate to their  abilities, mental and physical, shall also be made for them. And here  they are much more likely to succeed without the suffrage than with it.  It is not by general law-making that they can better themselves in  these particulars. Individual fitness for this or that branch of work  is what is required for success. And if, by thorough preparation, women  can discharge this or that task, not essentially masculine in its  requirements, as well as men, they may rest assured that in the end  their wages will be the same as those of their fathers and brothers in  the same field of work.    And how is it with our homes--how fares it with American women in the  family circle? To all right-minded women the duties connected with home  are most imperative, most precious, most blessed of all, partaking as  they do of the spirit of religious duty. To women this class of duties  is by choice, and by necessity, much more absorbing than it is to men.  It is the especial field of activity to which Providence has called  them; for which their Maker has qualified them by peculiar adaptation  of body and mind. To the great majority of American women these duties  are especially absorbing, owing to the difficulty of procuring paid  subordinates, well qualified for the tasks they undertake. The task of  positive labor, and the task of close supervision, are both  particularly burdensome to American wives and mothers. Thus far, or at  least until very recently, those duties of wife and mother have been  generally performed conscientiously. The heart of every worthy American  woman is in her home. That home, with its manifold interests, is  especially under her government. The good order, the convenience, the  comfort, the pleasantness, the whole economy of the house, in short,  depend in a very great measure on her. The food of the family is  prepared by her, either directly or by close supervision. The clothing  of the family passes through her hands or under her eye. The health of  the family is included within the same tender, watchful, loving  oversight. The education of the children is chiefly directed by her--in  many families almost exclusively so. Whether for evil or for good, by  careless neglect or by patient, thoughtful, prayerful guidance, she  marks out their future course. This is even too much the case. American  fathers love their children fondly; no fathers more affectionate than  they are; they pet their children; they toil ceaselessly for them; but  their education they leave almost entirely to the mother. It may be  said, with perfect truth, that in the great majority of American  families the educational influences come chiefly from the mother; they  are tacitly made over to her as a matter of course. The father has too  often very little to do with them. His work lies abroad, in the world  of business or politics, where all his time and attention are fully  absorbed. In this way the American mother rules the very heart of her  family. If at all worthy she has great influence with her husband; she  has great influence over her daughters; and as regards her sons, there  are too many cases in which hers is the only influence for good to  which they yield. Is there so little of true elevation and dignity in  this position that American women should be in such hot haste to  abandon it for a position as yet wholly untried, entirely theoretical  and visionary?    It will be said that all women are not married, that all wives are not  mothers, that there are childless widows and many single women in the  country. Quite true, but in a rapid sketch one looks at the chief  features only; and home life, with its varied duties, is, of course,  the principal point in every Christian country. The picture is  essentially correct, without touching on lesser details. We pause here  to observe also that almost every single woman has a home somewhere.  She makes a home for herself, or she is ingrafted on the home of  others, and wherever she may be--even in that wretched kind of  existence, boarding-house life--she may, if she choose, carry something  of the home spirit with her. In fact, every true woman instinctively  does so, whatever be the roof that covers her head. She thinks for  others, she plans for others, she serves others, she loves and  cherishes others, she unconsciously throws something of the web of home  feeling and home action over those near her, and over the dwelling she  inhabits. She carries the spirit of home and its duties into the niche  allotted to her--a niche with which she is generally far more contented  than the world at large believes--a niche which is never so narrow but  that it provides abundant material for varied work--often very pleasant  work too. Let it be understood, once for all, that the champions of  widows and single women are very much given to talking and writing  absurdly on this point. Their premises are often wholly false. They  often fancy discontent and disappointment and inaction where those  elements have no existence. Certainly it is not in the least worth  while to risk a tremendous social revolution in behalf of this minority  of the sex. Every widow and single woman can, if she choose, already  find abundance of the most noble occupation for heart, mind, body, and  soul. Carry the vote into her niche, she certainly will be none the  happier or more truly respectable for that bit of paper. It is also an  error to suppose that among the claimants for suffrage single women are  the most numerous or the most clamorous. The great majority of the  leaders in this movement appear to be married women.    A word more on the subject of home life, as one in which the interests  of the whole sex are most closely involved. It is clear that those  interests are manifold, highly important to the welfare of the race,  unceasing in their recurrence, urgent and imperative in their nature,  requiring for their successful development such devotion of time,  labor, strength, thought, feeling, that they must necessarily leave but  little leisure to the person who faithfully discharges them. The  comfort, health, peace, temper, recreation, general welfare,  intellectual, moral, and religious training of a family make up,  indeed, a charge of the very highest dignity, and one which must tax to  the utmost every faculty of the individual to whom it is intrusted. The  commander of a regiment at the head of his men, the member of Congress  in his seat, the judge on his bench, scarcely holds a position so  important, so truly honorable, as that of the intelligent, devoted,  faithful American wife and mother, wisely governing her household. And  what are the interests of the merchant, the manufacturer, the banker,  the broker, the speculator, the selfish politician, when compared with  those confided to the Christian wife and mother? They are too often  simply contemptible--a wretched, feverish, maddening struggle to pile  up lucre, which is any thing but clean. Where is the superior merit of  such a life, that we should hanker after it, when placed beside that of  the loving, unselfish, Christian wife and mother--the wife, standing at  her husband's side, to cheer, to aid, to strengthen, to console, to  counsel, amidst the trials of life; the mother, patiently, painfully,  and prayerfully cultivating every higher faculty of her children for  worthy action through time and eternity? Which of these positions has  the most of true elevation connected with it?    And then, again, let as look at the present position of American women  in society. In its best aspects social life may be said to be the  natural outgrowth of the Christian home. It is something far better  than the world, than Vanity Fair, than the Court of Mammon, where all  selfish passions meet and parade in deceptive masquerade. It is the  selfish element in human nature which pervades what we call the world;  self-indulgence, enjoyment, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye,  the pride of life, receive, in that arena, their full development.  Society, on the contrary, in its highest meaning, becomes the practical  development of the second great commandment, loving and serving our  neighbor.
