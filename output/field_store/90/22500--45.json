JOHNNY BOKER    This popular shanty was sometimes used for bunting-up a sail, but more  usually for 'sweating-up.' Although I have allowed the last note its  full musical value, it was not prolonged in this manner aboard ship.  As it coincided with the pull, it usually sounded more like a staccato  grunt.      28. HAUL AWAY, JOE    The major version of this shanty (which appears in Part II) was more  general in the last days of the sailing ship; but this minor version  (certainly the most beautiful of them) is the one which I used to hear  on the Tyne. The oldest of my sailor relatives never sang any other.  This inclines me to the belief that it is the earlier version. The  verses extemporized to this shanty were endless, but those concerning  the Nigger Girl and King Louis never seem to have been omitted. As in  No. 27, I have allowed the last note its full musical value, but  aboard ship it was sung in the same manner as No. 27.      29. WE'LL HAUL THE BOWLIN'    This was the most popular shanty for 'sweating-up.' There are many  variants of it. The present version I learnt from Capt. John Runciman.  In this shanty no attempt was ever made to sing the last word. It was  always shouted.      30. PADDY DOYLE'S BOOTS    This shanty differs from all others, as (_a_) it was sung _tutti_  throughout; (_b_) it had only one verse, which was sung over and over  again; and (_c_) it was used for one operation and one operation only,  viz. bunting up the foresail or mainsail in furling. In this operation  the canvas of the sail was folded intensively until it formed a smooth  conical bundle. This was called a bunt, and a strong collective effort  (at the word 'boots') was required to get it on to the yard.    Although the same verse was sung over and over again, very  occasionally a different text would be substituted, which was treated  in the same manner. Capt. Whall gives two alternatives, which were  sometimes used:         'We'll all drink brandy and gin,'    and--         'We'll all shave under the chin.'    Mr. Morley Roberts also told me that a variant in his ship was--         'We'll all throw dirt at the cook.'          THE SHANTY BOOK.    PART I.

Vol. 1 (of 2) (#7)"],[1,"had said  that man should not live by bread alone, but by ye Word of God. He would  of himselfe select ye most pathetic psalms, and chapters out of Job, to  reade to his mayde during his sicknesse, telling her when she pitied  him, that all God's children must suffer affliction. He declaim'd  against ye vanities of the world before he had seene any...... How  thankfully would he receive admonition, how soone be reconciled! how  indifferent, yet continually chereful! He would give grave advice to his  Brother John, beare with his impertinencies, and say he was but a  child!' Even allowing for Evelyn's tendency to exaggeration, this is  surely one of the very saddest stories about a child of tender years,  reared in a wrong manner, that has ever been written in the English  language. This loss was no doubt the occasion of his writing his fourth  work, _The Golden Book of St. John Chrysostom, concerning the Education  of Children. Translated out of the Greek_, which was published in  September, 1658. A further relief from grief was also found in the  translation of _The French Gardiner: instructing how to cultivate all  sorts of Fruit-trees and Herbs for the Garden; together with directions  to dry and conserve them in their natural; six times printed in France  and once in Holland. An accomplished piece, first written by N. de  Bonnefons, and now transplanted into English by Philocepos_.    It must have gratified his royalist feelings when, on 22 Oct. 1658, he  'saw ye superb funerall of ye Protector.' He remarks that 'it was the  joyfullest funerall I ever saw, for there were none that cried but dogs,  which the soldiers hooted away with a barbarous noise, drinking and  taking tobacco in the streets as they went.' Not long after this, on 25  April 1659, he notices 'a wonderfull and suddaine change in ye face of  ye publiq: ye new Protector Richard slighted, several pretenders and  parties strive for the government: all anarchy and confusion; Lord have  mercy on us!' For six months things drifted on, till on 11 Oct. 'the  Armie now turn'd out the Parliament. We had now no government in the  nation; all in confusion; no magistrate either own'd or pretended, but  ye soldiers, and they not agreed. God almighty have mercy on and settle  us!'    Evelyn apparently now thought the time ripe for him to venture; hence,  during 1659, he published _A Character of England as it was lately  presented in a Letter to a Noble Man of France_, and also _An Apology  for the Royal Party, written in a Letter to a person of the late Council  of State, by a Lover of Peace and of his Country. With a Touch at the  Pretended \"Plea for the Army_.\" Of the latter he remarks in his Diary:  'Nov. 7th. was publish'd my bold \"Apoligie for the King\" in this time of  danger, when it was capital to speake or write in favour of him. It was  twice printed, so universaly it took.' Encouraged by the success of this  work, he began to intrigue with Colonel Morley, Lieutenant of the Tower,  and Fay, Governor of Portsmouth, in the interest of the exiled Charles;  but Morley shrank from declaring for the King, and General Monk  returning from Scotland to London, broke down the gates of the city,  'marches to White-hall, dissipates that nest of robbers, and convenes  the old Parliament, the Rump Parliament (so called as retaining some few  rotten members of ye other) being dissolv'd; and for joy whereoff were  many thousands of rumps roasted publiqly in ye streets at the bonfires  this night, with ringing of bells and universal jubilee. This was the  first good omen.'    From the February till the April following thereon Evelyn was confined  to bed with ague and its after effects, but found strength to write and  publish a pamphlet, _The late News from Brussels unmasked, and His  Majesty vindicated from the base calumny and scandal therein fixed on  him_, 'in defence of his Majesty, against a wicked forg'd paper,  pretended to be sent from Bruxells to defame his Majesties person and  vertues, and render him odious, now when everybody was in hope and  expectation of the General and Parliament recalling him, and  establishing ye government on its antient and right basis.' Early in May  came the tidings that the King's application for restoration had been  accepted and acknowledged by the Parliament 'after a most bloudy and  unreasonable rebellion of neare 20 years,' and before the end of the  month Evelyn was an eye-witness of the triumphal entry of the new king  into his capital. '29th. This day his Majestie Charles the Second came  to London after a sad and long exile and calamitous suffering both of  the King and Church, being 17 years. This was also his birthday, and  with a triumph of above 20,000 horse and foote, brandishing their swords  and shouting with inexpressible joy; the wayes strew'd with flowers, the  bells ringing, the streets hung with tapissry, fountaines running with  wine; the Maior, Aldermen, and all the Companies in their liveries,  chaines of gold, and banners; Lords and Nobles clad in cloth of silver,  gold, and velvet; the windowes and balconies all set with ladies;  trumpets, music, and myriads of people flocking, even so far as from  Rochester, so as they were seven houres in passing the citty, even from  2 in ye afternoone till 9 at night. I stood in the Strand and beheld it,  and bless'd God. And all this was don without one drop of bloud shed,  and by that very army which rebell'd against him; but it was ye Lord's  doing, for such a restoration was never mention'd in any history antient  or modern, since the returne of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity;  nor so joyfull a day and so bright ever seene in this nation, this  hapning when to expect or effect it was past all human policy.'    Despite his dilettantism and dabbling in science, philosophy and  letters, Evelyn had for years past felt the desirability of having some  sort of fixed employment. Previous to this, during 1659, he had  communicated to the Hon. Robert Boyle, son of the Earl of Cork, a scheme  for founding a philosophic and mathematical college or fraternity, and  had even arranged with his wife that they should live asunder, in two  separate apartments. The Restoration, however, put a stop to this  scheme, which then evolved itself, soon afterwards, into the foundation  of the Royal Society, Boyle and Evelyn being two of the most prominent  original Fellows.      V    _Evelyn's Career after the Restoration. (1660-1685)._    Evelyn was about forty years of age when the Restoration changed the  whole prospects of his still long life. He had been a devoted Royalist,  though it can not be denied that his zeal in this respect was ever  tempered with a vast amount of caution and prudence. In addition to what  interest he had earned by his own actions, he had the far more powerful  influence of his father-in-law who had, like Charles himself, been  exiled for nineteen years. Mrs. Evelyn was promised the appointment of  lady of the jewels to the future Queen, which she never received; and  Evelyn might have had the honour of knighthood of the Bath, but declined  it. He was present at the Coronation in Westminster Abbey on St.  George's Day, 1661, and had prepared and printed a _Panegyric_ poem on  the occasion, a screed of bombastic doggerel in fulsome praise of the  King. He was a frequent visitor at the Court, and loved to sun himself  in the royal presence. One of the finest examples of this feature of  Evelyn's character is his _Fumifugium_, published in 1661, which will be  more particularly referred to later on, a work which marks the real  commencement of his literary career.    In 1661, also, Evelyn wrote a pamphlet entitled _Tyrannus or the Mode_,  an invective against 'our so much affecting the French' in dress, and he  was pleased with the idea that afterwards, in 1666, a change in costume  then adopted by the King and court was due to this cause. He, too,  donned and went to office in 'the vest and surcoat and tunic as 'twas  call'd, after his Majesty had brought the whole Court to it. It was a  comely and manly habit, too good to hold, it being impossible for us in  good earnest to leave ye Monsieurs vanities long.'    At length employment, at first unpaid, in the public service fell to  Evelyn in May, 1662, when along with 'divers gentlemen of quality,' he  was appointed one of the Commissioners 'for reforming the buildings,  wayes, streetes, and incumbrances, and regulating the hackney coaches in  the Citty of London.' About this same time he was also on the Commission  appointed 'about Charitable uses, and particularly to enquire how the  Citty had dispos'd of the revenues of Gressham College,' and in the  original grant of the Charter of the Royal Society he was nominated by  the King to be on its Council. Among the other Commissions upon which he  shortly sat were those on Sewers, and on the regulation of the Mint at  the Tower; but it was not till 27 Oct. 1664 that he received a paid  appointment as one of the four Commissioners for the care of the sick  and wounded prisoners to be made in the war declared against Holland.  For this the remuneration was 'a Salary L1,200 a year amongst us,  besides extraordinaries for our care and attention in time of station,  each of us being appointed to a particular district, mine falling out to  be Kent and Sussex.'    Before this, however, an event had occurred which must have given  intense gratification to Evelyn, when on 30th April, 1663, 'Came his  Majesty to honour my poore villa with his presence, viewing the gardens  and even every roome of the house, and was pleas'd to take a small  refreshment. There were with him the Duke of Richmond, E. of St. Albans,  Lord Lauderdale, and several persons of Quality.'    The year 1664 was a busy one for Evelyn, as he then brought out his two  great masterpieces _Sylva_ and the _Kalendarium Hortense_, of which more  anon, as well as the translation of a"]]]
