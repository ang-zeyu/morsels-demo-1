We enter into God's unity when we are united to His  Spirit, because then we have the same Spirit that He has; and we are  multiplied outwardly, as regards His dispositions, without leaving the  unity.    So that, as God acts infinitely, and we are of one spirit with Him, we  act much more than we could do by our own action. We must suffer  ourselves to be guided by Wisdom. This \"Wisdom\" is more moving than any  motion (Wisdom of Solomon vii. 24). Let us, then, remain in dependence  upon His action, and our action will be vigorous indeed.    \"All things were made by (the Word); and without Him was not anything  made that was made\" (John i. 3). God, in creating us, created us in His  image, after His likeness (Gen. i. 26). He gave to us the Spirit of the  Word by the breath of life (Gen. ii. 7), which He breathed into us when  we were created in the image of God, by the participation of the life of  the Word, who is the image of His Father. Now this life is one, simple,  pure, intimate, and fruitful.    The devil having disfigured this beautiful image, it became necessary  that this same Word, whose breath had been breathed into us at our  creation, should come to restore it. It was necessary that it should be  He, because He is the image of the Father; and a defaced image cannot be  repaired by its own action, but by the action of him who seeks to  restore it. Our _action_ then should be, to _put ourselves_ into a  position to suffer the action of God, and to allow the Word to retrace  His image in us. An image, if it could move, would by its movement  prevent the sculptor's perfecting it. Every movement of our own hinders  the work of the Heavenly Sculptor, and produces false features.    We must then remain silent, and only move as He moves us. Jesus Christ  has _life in Himself_ (John v. 26), and He must communicate life to all  who live.    That this action is the most noble cannot be denied. Things are only of  value as the principle in which they originate is noble, grand, and  elevated. Actions committed by a divine principle are _divine actions_;  whereas the actions of the creature, however good they may appear, are  _human actions_ or at best they are virtuous actions, if they are done  with the help of grace.    Jesus says that He has life in Himself; all other beings have but a  borrowed life, but the Word has life in Himself; and as He is  communicative, He desires to communicate this life to men. We must then  give place to this life, that it may flow in us, which can only be done  by evacuation, and the loss of the life of Adam and of our own action,  as St Paul assures us: \"If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature:  old things are passed away; behold all things are become new\" (2 Cor. v.  17). This can only be brought about by the death of ourselves and of our  own action, that the action of God may be substituted for it. We do not  profess, then, to be without action, but only to act in dependence upon  the Spirit of God, suffering His action to take the place of our own.  Jesus shows us this in the gospel. Martha did good things, but because  she did them of her own spirit, Christ reproved her for them. The spirit  of man is turbulent and boisterous; therefore it does little, though it  appears to do much. \"Martha, Martha,\" said Jesus, \"thou art careful and  troubled about many things; but one thing is needful; and Mary hath  chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her\" (Luke x.  41, 42).    What had she chosen, this Magdalene? Peace, tranquillity, and repose.  She apparently ceased to act, that she might be moved by the Spirit of  God; she ceased to live, that Christ might live in her.    This is why it is so necessary to renounce ourselves and all our own  works to follow Jesus; for we cannot follow Him unless we are animated  with His Spirit. In order that the Spirit of Christ may dwell in us, our  own spirit must give place to Him. \"He that is joined to the Lord,\" says  St Paul, \"is one spirit\" (1 Cor. vi. 17). \"It is good for me to draw  near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord God\" (Ps. lxxiii. 28). What  is this \"drawing near\"? It is the beginning of union.    Union has its beginning, its continuation, its completion, and its  consummation. The commencement of union is an inclination towards God.  When the soul is converted in the manner I have described, it has an  inclination to its centre, and a strong tendency to union: this tendency  is the commencement. Then it adheres, which happens when it approaches  nearer to God; then it is united to Him, and finally becomes one with  Him--that is, it becomes one spirit with Him; and it is then that this  spirit, which proceeded from God, returns to Him as its end.    It is, then, necessary that we should enter this way, which is the  divine motion, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. St Paul says, \"If any man  have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His\" (Rom. viii. 9). To be  Christ's, then, we must suffer ourselves to be filled with His Spirit,  and emptied of our own: our hearts must be evacuated. St Paul, in the  same place, proves to us the necessity of this divine motion: he says,  \"As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God\"  (Rom. viii. 14).    The divinely-imparted Spirit is the Spirit of divine sonship; therefore,  the same apostle continues, \"Ye have not received the spirit of bondage  again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we  cry, Abba, Father\" (Rom. viii. 15). This spirit is no other than the  Spirit of Christ, by whom we participate in His Sonship; and this  \"Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the sons of  God.\"    As soon as the soul leaves itself to be moved by the Spirit of God, it  experiences the witness of this divine sonship; and this witness serves  the more to increase its joy, as it makes it know _that it is called to  the liberty of the sons of God_, and that the spirit it has received is  not a spirit of bondage, but of liberty.    The Spirit of the divine motion is so necessary for all things, that  Paul founds this necessity upon our ignorance of the things that we ask  for. \"The Spirit,\" he says, \"helpeth our infirmities; for we know not  what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh  intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.\" This is  conclusive: if we do not know what to pray for, nor how to ask as we  ought for what is necessary for us, and if it is needful that the Spirit  who is in us, to whose motion we abandon ourselves, should ask it for  us, ought we not to leave Him to do it? He does it \"with groanings which  cannot be uttered.\"    This Spirit is the Spirit of the Word, who is always heard, as He says  Himself: \"I know that Thou hearest me always\" (John xi. 42). If we leave  it to the Spirit within us to ask and to pray, we shall always be  answered. Why so? O great apostle, mystic teacher, so deeply taught in  the inner life! teach us why. \"It is,\" he adds, \"because He that  searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because He  maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God;\" that  is to say, this Spirit only asks that which it is God's will to give. It  is God's will that we should be saved and that we should be perfect. He  asks, then, for all that is necessary to our perfection. Why, after  this, should we be burdened with superfluous cares, and be wearied in  the greatness of our way, without ever saying, There is no hope in  ourselves, and therefore resting in God? God Himself invites us to cast  all our care upon Him, and He complains, in inconceivable goodness, that  we employ our strength, our riches, and our treasure, in countless  exterior things, although there is so little joy to be found in them  all. \"Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread, and your  labour for that which satisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and  eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness\"  (Isa. lv. 2).    Oh, if it were known what happiness there is in thus hearkening unto  God, and how the soul is strengthened by it! All flesh must be silent  before the Lord (see Zech. ii. 13). All self-effort must cease when He  appears. In order still further to induce us to abandon ourselves to Him  without reserve, God assures us that we need fear nothing from such  abandonment, because He has a special individual care over each of us.  He says, \"Can a woman forget her sucking-child, that she should not have  compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, she may forget, yet will I not  forget thee\" (Isa. xlix. 15). Ah, words full of consolation! Who on  hearing them can fear to abandon himself utterly to the guidance of  God?          CHAPTER XVII.    DISTINCTION BETWEEN EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR ACTIONS--THOSE OF THE SOUL IN  THIS CONDITION ARE INTERIOR, BUT HABITUAL, CONTINUED, DIRECT, PROFOUND,  SIMPLE, AND IMPERCEPTIBLE--BEING A CONTINUAL SINKING IN THE OCEAN OF  DIVINITY--SIMILITUDE OF A VESSEL--HOW TO ACT IN THE ABSENCE OF SENSIBLE  SUPPORTS.      The actions of men are either exterior or interior. The _exterior_ are  those which appear outwardly, and have a sensible object, possessing  neither good nor evil qualities, excepting as they receive them from the  interior principle in which they originate. It is not of these that I  intend to speak, but only of interior actions, which are those actions  of the soul by which it _applies itself_ inwardly to some object, or  _turns away_ from some other.    When, being applied to God, I desire to commit an action of a different  nature from those which He would prompt, I turn away from God, and I  turn towards created things more or less according to the strength or  weakness of my action. If, being turned towards the creature, I wish to  return to God, I must commit the action of turning away from the  creature, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25"],[0,"The 1991 CIA World Factbook (#7)"],[1,"expenditures: $857 million, 1.8% of GDP (1991)  _%_  _@_American Samoa  (territory of the US)  _*_Geography  _#_Total area: 199 km2; land area: 199 km2      _#_Comparative area: slightly larger than Washington, DC      _#_Land boundaries: none      _#_Coastline: 116 km      _#_Maritime claims:    Contiguous zone: 12 nm;    Continental shelf: 200 m (depth);    Exclusive economic zone: 200 nm;    Territorial sea: 12 nm      _#_Climate: tropical marine, moderated by southeast trade winds;  annual rainfall averages 124 inches; rainy season from November to April,  dry season from May to October; little seasonal temperature variation      _#_Terrain: five volcanic islands with rugged peaks and limited  coastal plains, two coral atolls      _#_Natural resources: pumice and pumicite      _#_Land use: arable land 10%; permanent crops 5%; meadows and  pastures 0%; forest and woodland 75%; other 10%      _#_Environment: typhoons common from December to March      _#_Note: Pago Pago has one of the best natural deepwater harbors in  the South Pacific Ocean, sheltered by shape from rough seas and protected  by peripheral mountains from high winds; strategic location about  3,700 km south-southwest of Honolulu in the South Pacific Ocean about  halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand      _*_People  _#_Population: 43,052 (July 1991), growth rate 2.9% (1991)      _#_Birth rate: 41 births/1,000 population (1991)      _#_Death rate: 4 deaths/1,000 population (1991)      _#_Net migration rate: - 8 immigrants/1,000 population (1991)      _#_Infant mortality rate: 11 deaths/1,000 live births (1991)      _#_Life expectancy at birth: 69 years male, 74 years female (1991)      _#_Total fertility rate: 5.4 children born/woman (1991)      _#_Nationality: noun--American Samoan(s); adjective--American Samoan      _#_Ethnic divisions: Samoan (Polynesian) 90%, Caucasian 2%, Tongan  2%, other 6%      _#_Religion: Christian Congregationalist 50%, Roman Catholic 20%,  Protestant denominations and other 30%      _#_Language: Samoan (closely related to Hawaiian and other Polynesian  languages) and English; most people are bilingual      _#_Literacy: 97% (male 97%, female 97%) age 15 and over can  read and write (1980)      _#_Labor force: 11,145; government 48%, tuna canneries 33%, other  19% (1986 est.)      _#_Organized labor: NA      _#_Note: about 65,000 American Samoans live in the States of  California and Washington and 20,000 in Hawaii      _*_Government  _#_Long-form name: Territory of American Samoa      _#_Type: unincorporated and unorganized territory of the US      _#_Capital: Pago Pago      _#_Administrative divisions: none (territory of the US)      _#_Independence: none (territory of the US)      _#_Constitution: ratified 1966, in effect 1967      _#_National holiday: Flag Day, 17 April (1900)      _#_Executive branch: President of the US, governor, lieutenant  governor      _#_Legislative branch: bicameral Legislative Assembly (Fono) consists  of an upper house or Senate and a lower house or House of Representatives      _#_Judicial branch: High Court      _#_Leaders:    Chief of State--President George BUSH (since 20 January 1989);  Vice President Dan QUAYLE (since 20 January 1989);    Head of Government--Governor Peter Tali COLEMAN (since 20  January 1989);  Lieutenant Governor Galea'i POUMELE (since NA 1989)      _#_Suffrage: universal at age 18; indigenous inhabitants are US  nationals, not US citizens      _#_Elections:    Governor--last held 7 November 1988 (next to be held November  1992); results--Peter T.
