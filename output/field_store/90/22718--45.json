I therefore hastily shut them both into one room, and went  out into the fields!    When in the course of an hour's time I came home again, each dog was  reposing in a corner--the image of peace; there was no further fracas,  and there has never been any trouble since. Later on, indeed, both  became good friends, and often played together, but it was a risky  experiment and grim forebodings had beset me on that walk! But having  occasion to apply the same cure in another case, I met with the same  success again.          BEGINNING THE TUITION.      Lola had been four days with me--accompanying me through the house, and  about the farm, at first on a lead, but soon without. Her extreme  animation verged on wildness; I was struck with her elastic temperament  and her constant attentiveness, and it seemed to me that this dog would  hardly be able to sit still for five minutes. She already knew \"yes,\"  and \"no,\" and in my joy at possessing a dog able to answer me, I put so  many questions to her that I began to be afraid I might do her some  injury. I was, in fact, so afraid, so in doubt as to my understanding,  and so alive to my responsibilities in the matter, that I often wished  I had not accepted the dog at all. I did not even know whether I could  \"teach\"--much less whether I could \"teach a dog,\" whom, moreover, no  hereditary \"urge\" would induce to attend school once she knew that this  would mean having to work and be attentive!    Doubts as to whether the dog understood me; in what way she understood  me; what sort of creature a dog really was--whether she could \"think,\"  \"feel,\" or even whether she was capable of hearing in the same way as  we hear; able to see in the same way that we see with our eyes; whether  she already possessed some cognition of the human language, and whether  this possessed any meaning for her? For all at once I _knew_ that I  _knew nothing_. That I had not even the least idea as to the best  manner to assume, whether I ought to be gentle or strict--these are but  a few of the difficulties I found myself beset by. I was, in short,  almost in despair. How could I presume to form an opinion, supposing  that, merely to my own shortcomings, the animal remained an animal,  that is--in as far as I was concerned--an \"animal\" in the same sense  that all creatures have been, since time immemorial--according to man's  opinion? How should I dare to attempt to add my contribution to man's  store of knowledge in so weighty a matter without as much as knowing  whether I possessed the requisite patience--a genuine gift for  imparting tuition, and a sufficient measure of devotion? Above all, how  could I have been so foolhardy as to have undertaken to make my  investigations in connexion with a descendant of Rolf's! Indeed, my  only excuse could be my intense love of knowledge, my reverence and  high regard for science. Science--whose temple we may enter only when  filled with intensest Will, and with pure Truthfulness vowed to the  furtherance of her Service--be the results sweet or bitter, fraught  with success or failure, easy or difficult, new, or along the well-worn  paths. It was in _this_ sense that I sought to adventure--was bound to  venture, for the die was cast. It was, therefore, with all the powers I  could bring to my aid that I decided to embark on my quest--no matter  what the attendant results might force me to acknowledge. I would  disregard no test that might prove a contribution towards the solving  of this new question.    Vowed to these responsibilities I sat down opposite to my dog and  began. Said I to myself: She knows that she has to rap with her paws,  and that rapping _twice_ or _three_ times does not mean the same thing;  she knows, therefore, that the difference between these numbers of raps  has some meaning. I then began to count to her on my fingers--at first  from one to five and then back, finally taking the numbers irregularly  and then holding up as many fingers as composed the number in question.  To my surprise the dog was quiet and attentive, and I therefore soon  continued to count up to ten. In order to enforce this lesson more I  placed a row of small lumps of sugar in front of her, counting them as  I did so--for it seemed to me that these might draw her attention more  to the _numbers_. And I also rewarded her from time to time with a  little bit for having sat so still. Then, holding up four fingers, I  ventured with the question: \"How many fingers do I show? Rap out the  number!\" And to my joy she rapped \"4!\" Yet, thinking this might have  been accidental, I held up five and said: \"Rap out this number!\" and  taking hold of her paw this time in order to make her tap her answer on  the palm of my hand. After this I ceased my questions, for it seemed  impossible that she should have comprehended so readily, but I went on  just repeating the numbers to her. On the following day I also only  counted, and then began questioning again, for I could not understand  why she refused to look at my hands any more, and was continually  yawning. Therefore, without holding out my hands, I asked her: \"How  many make six?\" At which she gave six raps. I could hardly believe it,  so I asked her: \"four?\" and she replied with four raps. I asked for  five, and she answered correctly. I was now confident that she did  understand; but what mystified me was the celerity with which her  answers were given, for allowing even that she had understood, this  swiftness seemed incomprehensible, and I decided to form no opinion  until I had tested her with higher numbers, and should be in a position  to discount the possibility of accident.    On the third day--after the preliminary counting--I got as far as ten  by means of questions, and ten seemed for some days to be the limit  set--calling on me to halt, as it were. This notion led me to teach the  dog addition first so as by this means to get over the simple questions  as to the numbers, which were always given correctly.    All this I found quite easy to do, either using my fingers or using  lumps of sugar for my purpose; I was at the same time careful to speak  very distinctly and to use as few complicated phrases as possible. I  would say, for instance, \"Look here! two fingers and two fingers are  1--2--3--4 fingers!\" But soon she ceased to follow with her eyes, so  that I became disheartened and thought I had gone ahead too rapidly,  or, had not roused sufficient interest; not waiting for the  psychological moment, but seeking to handle the sensitive mechanism of  a sentient creature too roughly. Yet--surely this could not be so, for,  after all, I was but tentatively trying, and, indeed it was open to me  \"to try\"--even if without confidence! I then said: \"How much is two and  five?\" doing so without illustrating the question with my fingers, and  the dog rapped seven! I felt a warm thrill of delight, yet I controlled  my joy and proceeded with my questions, although at that moment I said  to myself: \"A living creature has given you a conscious answer!\"    We now continued: \"1 and 3?\" Answer: \"4.\" \"2 and 6?\" Answer: \"8.\" This  seemed to me enough for one day, and I allowed her to scamper off with  a reward for her diligence; then I sat and meditated on my experience.  The fact was evident: the dog had understood me--I had seen it in her  eyes. She had reflected first and had then tapped the palm of my hand  with unwavering certainty. I had seen the process and had felt it. Now,  it is not wise to be guided by one's feelings alone--our judgment  should be unbiased, and so I decided to test these facts according to  reason and in every conceivable way. Yet, no one having once  experienced what I had, could ever forget the sensation, for it was  like the dawning of some great truth, rising suddenly before one's  eyes--clear and immense. It appeared to me as some beautiful gift of  life, and I was seized with a feeling of reverence for all that may yet  lie undiscovered. For this new light of which I had caught the first  flash, as though reflected in some bright crystal such as I might hold  in my hand--how I yearned to transmit it--to pass this gift--this  joy--on to others as soon as the veil should have further lifted and  the horizon have become wider. And, before passing on again to the  practical and scientific side of these investigations, I should like to  say that where we have to do with warm, pulsating life, feeling too has  its rights, and must go hand-in-hand with reason. For it is feeling,  love and patience that must first penetrate the _subject-matter_,  while to reason is assigned the studying, the weighing and the proving  along the path pursued by the creative, seeking spirit of man. Such is  man: how humble by comparison is the animal! Yet should our love  henceforth assign to it its own place--as well as its own rights--as  our lowlier companion in the work of life.    Soon I ventured beyond ten. For lack of any more fingers I got a  counting frame, such as small children use at school, and the red and  white wire-strung balls assisted me to explain my meaning as plainly as  I could. I had forgotten the exact manner in which such lessons had  been given me, but I hoped for the best! Indeed, \"logic\" was part and  parcel of every step taken during this course of instruction. Never  having taught before, I was desperately anxious to give a logical--a  reasonable--explanation of everything to this other being respecting  those things which were quite clear to me. Those, too, who saw the dog  was learning something new, also felt that she seemed to arrive at what  I explained to her with great rapidity and by exercising thought; that,  moreover, she understood the matter as I understood it, and all were  convinced that there could be no doubt but that she _did think_.    I asked her, \"14,\" \"12,\" \"15\"?

The writer of a most readable article on the acclimatisation of animals  in the _Edinburgh Review_,[9] gives an amusing recital of the arrival of  a chimpanzee at the Zoological Gardens. It was related to him by the  late Mr Mitchell, who was long the active secretary of the society, and  who did much to improve the Gardens. \"One damp November evening, just  before dusk, there arrived a French traveller from Senegal, with a  companion closely muffled up in a burnoose at his side. On going, at his  earnest request, to speak to him at the gate, he communicated to me the  interesting fact that the stranger in the burnoose was a young chim, who  had resided in his family in Senegal for some twelve months, and who had  accompanied him to England. The animal was in perfect health; but from  the state of the atmosphere required good lodging, and more tender care  than could be found in a hotel. He proposed to sell his friend. I was  hard; did not like pulmonic property[10] at that period of the year,  having already two of the race in moderate health, but could not refrain  from an offer of hospitality during Chim's residence in London. Chim was  to go to Paris if I did not buy him. So we carried him, burnoose and  all, into the house where the lady chims were, and liberated him in the  doorway. They had taken tea, and were beginning to think of their early  couch. When the Senegal Adonis caught sight of them, he assumed a jaunty  air and advanced with politeness, as if to offer them the last news from  Africa. A yell of surprise burst from each chimpanzella as they  successively recognised the unexpected arrival. One would have supposed  that all the Billingsgate of Chimpanzeedom rolled from the voluble  tongues of these unsophisticated and hitherto unimpressible young  ladies; but probably their gesticulations, their shrill exclamations,  their shrinkings, their threats, were but well-mannered expressions of  welcome to a countryman thus abruptly revealed in the foreign land of  their captivity. Sir Chim advanced undaunted, and with the composure of  a high-caste pongo; if he had had a hat he would have doffed it  incontinently, as it was, he only slid out of his burnoose and ascended  into the apartment which adjoined his countrywomen with agile grace, and  then, through the transparent separation, he took a closer view. Juliana  yelled afresh. Paquita crossed her hands, and sat silently with face  about three quarters averted. Sir Chim uttered what may have been a  tranquillising phrase, expressive of the great happiness he felt on thus  being suddenly restored to the presence of kinswomen in the moment of  his deepest bereavement. Juliana calmed. Paquita diminished her angle of  aversion, and then Sir Chim, advancing quite close to the division,  began what appeared to be a recollection of a minuet. He executed  marvellous gestures with a precision and aplomb which were quite  enchanting, and when at last he broke out into a quick movement with  loud smacking stamps, the ladies were completely carried away, and gave  him all attention. Friendship was established, refreshments were served,  notwithstanding the previous tea, and everybody was apparently  satisfied, especially the stranger. Upon asking the Senegal proprietor  what the dance meant, he told me that the animal had voluntarily taken  to that imitation of his slaves, who used to dance every evening in the  courtyard.\"    So far Mr Mitchell's narrative; the reviewer relates how a chimpanzee,  placed for a short time in the society of the children of his owner in  this country, not only throve in an extraordinary manner, was perfectly  docile and good-tempered, but learnt to imitate them. When the eldest  little boy wished to tease his playfellow, he used, childlike, to make  faces at him. Chim soon outdid him, and one of the funniest things  imaginable was to see him blown at and blowing in return; his  protrusible lips converted themselves into a trumpet-shaped instrument,  which reminded one immediately of some of the devils of Albert Duerer, or  those incredible forms which the old painters used to delight in piling  together in their temptations of Saint Anthony.      LADY ANNE BARNARD PLEADS FOR THE BABOONS.    Lady Anne Barnard, whose name as the writer of \"Auld Robin Gray\" is  familiar to every one who knows that most pathetic ballad, spent five  years with her husband at the Cape (1797-1802). Her journal letters to  her sisters are most amusing, and full of interesting observations.[11]  After describing \"Musquito-hunting\" with her husband, she writes:--\"In  return, I endeavoured to effect a treaty of peace for the baboons, who  are apt to come down from the mountain in little troops to pillage our  garden of the fruit with which the trees are loaded. I told him he would  be worse than Don Carlos if he refused the children of the sun and the  soil the use of what had descended from ouran-outang to ouran-outang;  but, alas! I could not succeed. He had pledged himself to the  gardener,[12] to the slaves, and all the dogs, not to baulk them of  their sport; so he shot a superb man-of-the-mountain one morning, who  was marauding, and electrified himself the same moment, so shocked was  he at the groan given by the poor creature as he limped off the ground.  I do not think I shall hear of another falling a sacrifice to Barnard's  gun; they come too near the human race\" (p. 408).    In another letter she says (p. 391), \"The best way to get rid of them is  to catch one, whip him, and turn him loose; he skips off chattering to  his comrades, and is extremely angry, but none of them return the season  this is done. I have given orders, however, that there may be no  whipping.\"      S. BISSET AND HIS TRAINED MONKEYS.    We have elsewhere referred to S. Bisset as a trainer of animals. Among  the earliest of his trials, this Scotchman took two monkeys as pupils.  One of these he taught to dance and tumble on the rope, whilst the other  held a candle with one paw for his companion, and with the other played  a barrel organ. These animals he also instructed to play several  fanciful tricks, such as drinking to the company, riding and tumbling  upon a horse's back, and going through several regular dances with a  dog. The horse and dog referred to, were the first animals on which this  ingenious person tried his skill. Although Bisset lived in the last  century, few persons seem to have surpassed him in his power of teaching  the lower animals. We have seen a man in Charlotte Square, in 1865, make  a new-world monkey go through a series of tricks, ringing a bell, firing  a pea-gun, and such like. Poor Jacko was to be pitied. His want of heart  in his labours was very evident. Poor fellow, no time for reflection was  allowed him. Like some of the masters in the Old High School,--such  cruelty dates back more than thirty years,--a ferule, or a pair of tawse  kept Jacko to his work. It was play to the onlookers, but no sport to  master Cebus. Had he possessed memory and reflection, how his thoughts  must have wandered from Edinburgh to the forests of the Amazon!      LORD BYRON'S PETS.    Beside horses and dogs, the poet Byron, like his own Don Juan, had a  kind of inclination, or weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,  _live animals_.    Captain Medwin records, in one of his conversations, that the poet  remarked that it was troublesome to travel about with so much live and  dead stock as he did, and adds--\"I don't like to leave behind me any of  my pets, that have been accumulating since I came on the Continent. One  cannot trust to strangers to take care of them. You will see at the  farmer's some of my pea-fowls _en pension_. Fletcher tells me that they  are almost as bad fellow-travellers as the monkey, which I will show  you.\" Here he led the way to a room where he played with and caressed  the creature for some time. He afterwards bought another monkey in Pisa,  because he saw it ill-used.[13]    Lord Byron's travelling equipage to Pisa in the autumn of 1821,  consisted, _inter caetera_, of nine horses, a monkey, a bull-dog, and a  mastiff, two cats, three pea-fowls, and some hens.[14]      THE ETTRICK SHEPHERD'S MONKEY.    (_From the \"Noctes Ambrosianae,\" Dec. 1825._[15])    _Shepherd._ I wish that you but saw my monkey, Mr North. He would make  you hop the twig in a guffaw. I ha'e got a pole erected for him, o'  about some 150 feet high, on a knowe ahint Mount Benger; and the way the  cretur rins up to the knob, looking ower the shouther o' him, and  twisting his tail roun' the pole for fear o' playin' thud on the grun',  is comical past a' endurance.    _North._ Think you, James, that he is a link?    _Shepherd._ A link in creation? Not he, indeed. He is merely a monkey.  Only to see him on his observatory, beholding the sunrise! or weeping,  like a Laker, at the beauty o' the moon and stars!    _North._ Is he a bit of a poet?    _Shepherd._ Gin he could but speak and write, there can be nae manner o'  doubt that he would be a gran' poet. Safe us! what een in the head o'  him! Wee, clear, red, fiery, watery, malignant-lookin een, fu' o'  inspiration.    _Tickler._ You should have him stuffed.    _Shepherd._ Stuffed, man! say, rather, embalmed. But he's no likely to  dee for years to come--indeed, the cretur's engaged to be married;  although he's no in the secret himsel yet. The bawns are published.    _Tickler._ Why really, James, marriage I think ought to be simply a  civil contract.    _Shepherd._ A civil contract! I wuss it was. But, oh! Mr Tickler, to see  the cretur sittin wi' a pen in 's hand, and pipe in 's mouth, jotting  down a sonnet, or odd, or lyrical ballad! Sometimes I put that black  velvet cap ye gied me on"]]]
