They had been hospitably received and adopted into the tribe.  In requital for their entertainment, they offered to betray the Indians  if Vasco Nunez, the new governor, would condone their past offenses.  They filled the minds of the Spaniards, alike covetous and hungry, with  stories of great treasures and what was equally valuable, abundant  provisions, in Coreta's village.    Balboa immediately consented.  The act of treachery was consummated and  the chief captured.  All that, of course, was very bad, but the  difference between Balboa and the men of his time is seen in his after  conduct.  Instead of putting the unfortunate chieftain to death and  taking his people for slaves, Balboa released him.  The reason he  released him was because of a woman--a woman who enters vitally into  the subsequent history of Vasco Nunez, and indeed of the whole of South  America.  This was the beautiful daughter of the chief.  Anxious to  propitiate his captor, Careta offered Balboa this flower of the family  {37} to wife.  Balboa saw her, loved her and took her to himself.  They  were married in accordance with the Indian custom; which, of course,  was not considered in the least degree binding by the Spaniards of that  time.  But it is to Balboa's credit that he remained faithful to this  Indian girl.  Indeed, if he had not been so much attached to her it is  probable that he might have lived to do even greater things than he did.    In his excursions throughout the Isthmus, Balboa had met a chief called  Comagre.  As everywhere, the first desire of the Spanish was gold.  The  metal had no commercial value to the Indians.  They used it simply to  make ornaments, and when it was not taken from them by force, they were  cheerfully willing to exchange it for beads, trinkets, hawks' bells,  and any other petty trifles.  Comagre was the father of a numerous  family of stalwart sons.  The oldest, observing the Spaniards brawling  and fighting--\"brabbling,\" Peter Martyr calls it--about the division of  gold, with an astonishing degree of intrepidity knocked over the scales  at last and dashed the stuff on the ground in contempt.  He made amends  for his action by telling them of a country where gold, like Falstaff's  reasons, was as plenty as blackberries.  Incidentally he gave them the  news that Darien was an isthmus, and that the other side was swept by a  vaster sea than that which washed its eastern shore.    These tidings inspired Balboa and his men.  They talked long and  earnestly with the Indians and fully satisfied themselves of the  existence of a great sea and of a far-off country abounding in treasure  on the other side.  Could it be that mysterious Cipango of Marco Polo,  search for which had been the object of Columbus's voyage?  The way  there was discussed and the {38} difficulties of the journey estimated,  and it was finally decided that at least one thousand Spaniards would  be required safely to cross the Isthmus.    Balboa had sent an account of this conversation to Spain, asking for  the one thousand men.  The account reached there long before Pedrarias  sailed, and to it, in fact, was largely due the extensive expedition.  Now when Balboa learned from Zamudio of what was intended toward him in  Spain, he determined to undertake the discovery himself.  He set forth  from Antigua the 1st of September, 1513, with a hundred and ninety  chosen men, accompanied by a pack of bloodhounds, very useful in  fighting savages, and a train of Indian slaves.  Francisco Pizarro was  his second in command.  All this in lieu of the one thousand Spaniards  for which he had asked, which was not thought to be too great a number.    The difficulties to be overcome were almost incredible.  The expedition  had to fight its way through tribes of warlike and ferocious  mountaineers.  If it was not to be dogged by a trail of pestilent  hatreds, the antagonisms evoked by its advance must be composed in  every Indian village or tribe before it progressed farther.  Aside from  these things, the topographical difficulties were immense.  The  Spaniards were armour-clad, as usual, and heavily burdened.  Their way  led through thick and overgrown and pathless jungles or across lofty  and broken mountain-ranges, which could be surmounted only after the  most exhausting labor.  The distance as the crow flies, was short, less  than fifty miles, but nearly a month elapsed before they approached the  end of their journey.    Balboa's enthusiasm and courage had surmounted every obstacle.  He made  friends with the chiefs {39} through whose territories he passed, if  they were willing to be friends.  If they chose to be enemies, he  fought them, he conquered them and then made friends with them then.  Such a singular mixture of courage, adroitness and statesmanship was he  that everywhere he prevailed by one method or another.  Finally, in the  territory of a chief named Quarequa, he reached the foot of the  mountain range from the summit of which his guides advised him that he  could see the object of his expedition.    There were but sixty-seven men capable of ascending that mountain.  The  toil and hardship of the journey had incapacitated the others.  Next to  Balboa, among the sixty-seven, was Francisco Pizarro.  Early on the  morning of the 25th of September, 1513, the little company began the  ascent of the Sierra.  It was still morning when they surmounted it and  reached the top.  Before them rose a little cone, or crest, which hid  the view toward the south.  \"There,\" said the guides, \"from the top of  yon rock, you can see the ocean.\"  Bidding his men halt where they  were, Vasco Nunez went forward alone and surmounted the little  elevation.    A magnificent prospect was embraced in his view.  The tree-clad  mountains sloped gently away from his feet, and on the far horizon  glittered a line of silver which attested the accuracy of the claim of  the Indians as to the existence of a great sea on the other side of  what he knew now to be an isthmus.  Balboa named the body of water that  he could see far away, flashing in the sunlight of that bright morning,  \"the Sea of the South,\" or \"the South Sea.\" [2]    Drawing his sword, he took possession of it in the {40} name of Castile  and Leon.  Then he summoned his soldiers.  Pizarro in the lead they  were soon assembled at his side.  In silent awe they gazed, as if they  were looking upon a vision.  Finally some one broke into the words of a  chant, and on that peak in Darien those men sang the \"Te Deum Laudamus.\"    [Illustration: \"He Took Possession of the Sea in the Name of Castile  and Leon\"]    Somehow the dramatic quality of that supreme moment in the life of  Balboa has impressed itself upon the minds of the successive  generations that have read of it since that day.  It stands as one of  the great episodes of history.  That little band of ragged,  weather-beaten, hard-bitten soldiers, under the leadership of the most  lovable and gallant of the Spaniards of his time, on that lonely  mountain peak rising above the almost limitless sea of trackless  verdure, gazing upon the great ocean whose waters extended before them  for thousands and thousands of miles, attracts the attention and fires  the imagination.    Your truly great man may disguise his imaginative qualities from the  unthinking public eye, but his greatness is in proportion to his  imagination.  Balboa, with the centuries behind him, shading his eye  and staring at the water:      ----Dipt into the future far as human eye could see,    Saw the visions of the world, and all the wonder that would be.      He saw Peru with its riches; he saw fabled Cathay; he saw the uttermost  isles of the distant sea.  His imagination took the wings of the  morning and soared over worlds and countries that no one but he had  ever dreamed of, all to be the fiefs of the King of Castile.  It is  interesting to note that it must have been to Balboa, of all men, that  some adequate idea of the real size of the earth first came.    {41}    Well, they gazed their fill; then, with much toil, they cut down trees,  dragged them to the top of the mountain and erected a huge cross which  they stayed by piles of stones.  Then they went down the mountain-side  and sought the beach.  It was no easy task to find it, either.  It was  not until some days had passed that one of the several parties broke  through the jungle and stood upon the shore.  When they were all  assembled, the tide was at low ebb.  A long space of muddy beach lay  between them and the water.  They sat down under the trees and waited  until the tide was at flood, and then, on the 29th of September, with a  banner displaying the Virgin and Child above the arms of Spain in one  hand and with drawn sword in the other, Balboa marched solemnly into  the rolling surf that broke about his waist and took formal possession  of the ocean, and all the shores, wheresoever they might be, which were  washed by its waters, for Ferdinand of Aragon, and his daughter Joanna  of Castile, and their successors in Spain.  Truly a prodigious claim,  but one which for a time Spain came perilously near establishing and  maintaining.[3]      [Illustration: \"He Threw the Sacred Volume to the Ground in a Violent  Rage\"]    Before they left the shore they found some canoes and voyaged over to a  little island in the bay, which they called San Miguel, since it was  that saint's day, and where they were nearly all swept away by the  rising tide.  They went back to Antigua by another route, somewhat less  difficult, fighting and making peace as before, and amassing treasure  the while.  Great was the joy of the colonists who had been left  behind, when Balboa and his men rejoined them.  {42} Those who had  stayed behind shared equally with those who had gone.

It was, he told himself, absurd to take so  keen an interest in a person whom he had not seen for more than ten  minutes, and who a week before was a perfect stranger. But somehow the  girl had made a deeper impression upon him than he had realised. This  man, who had spent his life in the investigation of crime and in the  study of criminals, had found little time to interest himself in  womanhood, and Odette Rider had been a revelation to him.    \"I happen to know there was a quarrel. I also know the cause,\" he said,  and related briefly the circumstances under which he himself had met  Thornton Lyne. \"What have you against her?\" he said, with an assumption  of carelessness which he did not feel.    \"Nothing definite,\" said the Commissioner. \"Her principal accuser is the  man Stay. Even he did not accuse her directly, but he hinted that she was  responsible, in some way which he did not particularise, for Thornton  Lyne's death. I thought it curious that he should know anything about  this girl, but I am inclined to think that Thornton Lyne made this man  his confidant.\"    \"What about the man?\" asked Tarling. \"Can he account for his movements  last night and early this morning?\"    \"His statement,\" replied the Commissioner, \"is that he saw Mr. Lyne at  his flat at nine o'clock, and that Mr. Lyne gave him five pounds in the  presence of Lyne's butler. He said he left the flat and went to his  lodgings in Lambeth, where he went to bed very early. All the evidence we  have been able to collect supports his statement. We have interviewed  Lyne's butler, and his account agrees with Stay's. Stay left at five  minutes past nine, and at twenty-five minutes to ten--exactly half an  hour later--Lyne himself left the house, driving his two-seater. He was  alone, and told the butler he was going to his club.\"    \"How was he dressed?\" asked Tarling.    \"That is rather important,\" nodded the Commissioner. \"For he was  in evening dress until nine o'clock--in fact, until after Stay had  gone--when he changed into the kit in which he was found dead.\"    Tarling pursed his lips.    \"He'd hardly change from evening into day dress to go to his club,\" he  said.    He left Scotland Yard a little while after this, a much puzzled man. His  first call was at the flat in Edgware Road which Odette Rider occupied.  She was not at home, and the hall porter told him that she had been away  since the afternoon of the previous day. Her letters were to be sent on  to Hertford. He had the address, because it was his business to intercept  the postman and send forward the letters.    \"Hillington Grove, Hertford.\"    Tarling was worried. There was really no reason why he should be, he told  himself, but he was undoubtedly worried. And he was disappointed too. He  felt that, if he could have seen the girl and spoken with her for a few  minutes, he could have completely disassociated her from any suspicion  which might attach. In fact, that she was away from home, that she had  \"disappeared\" from her flat on the eve of the murder, would be quite  enough, as he knew, to set the official policeman nosing on her trail.    \"Do you know whether Miss Rider has friends at Hertford?\" he asked the  porter.    \"Oh, yes, sir,\" said the man nodding. \"Miss Rider's mother lives there.\"    Tarling was going, when the man detained him with a remark which switched  his mind back to the murder and filled him with a momentary sense of  hopeless dismay.    \"I'm rather glad Miss Rider didn't happen to be in last night, sir,\" he  said. \"Some of the tenants upstairs were making complaints.\"    \"Complaints about what?\" asked Tarling, and the man hesitated.    \"I suppose you're a friend of the young lady's, aren't you?\" and Tarling  nodded.    \"Well, it only shows you,\" said the porter confidentially, \"how people  are very often blamed for something they did not do. The tenant in the  next flat is a bit crotchety; he's a musician, and rather deaf. If he  hadn't been deaf, he wouldn't have said that Miss Rider was the cause of  his being wakened up. I suppose it was something that happened outside.\"    \"What did he hear?\" asked Tarling quickly, and the porter laughed.    \"Well, sir, he thought he heard a shot, and a scream like a woman's. It  woke him up. I should have thought he had dreamt it, but another tenant,  who also lives in the basement, heard the same sound, and the rum thing  was they both thought it was in Miss Rider's flat.\"    \"What time was this?\"    \"They say about midnight, sir,\" said the porter; \"but, of course, it  couldn't have happened, because Miss Rider had not been in, and the flat  was empty.\"    Here was a disconcerting piece of news for Tarling to carry with him on  his railway journey to Hertford. He was determined to see the girl and  put her on her guard, and though he realised that it was not exactly his  duty to put a suspected criminal upon her guard, and that his conduct  was, to say the least of it, irregular, such did not trouble him very  much.    He had taken his ticket and was making his way to the platform when he  espied a familiar figure hurrying as from a train which had just come in,  and apparently the man saw Tarling even before Tarling had recognised  him, for he turned abruptly aside and would have disappeared into the  press of people had not the detective overtaken him.    \"Hullo, Mr. Milburgh!\" he said. \"Your name is Milburgh, if I remember  aright?\"    The manager of Lyne's Store turned, rubbing his hands, his habitual smile  upon his face.    \"Why, to be sure,\" he said genially, \"it's Mr. Tarling, the detective  gentleman. What sad news this is, Mr. Tarling! How dreadful for everybody  concerned!\"    \"I suppose it has meant an upset at the Stores, this terrible happening?\"    \"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Milburgh in a shocked voice. \"Of course we closed  the Store for the day. It is dreadful--the most dreadful thing within my  experience. Is anybody suspected, sir?\" he asked.    Tarling shook his head.    \"It is a most mysterious circumstance, Mr. Milburgh,\" he said. And then:  \"May I ask if any provision had been made to carry on the business in the  event of Mr. Lyne's sudden death?\"    Again Milburgh hesitated, and seemed reluctant to reply.    \"I am, of course, in control,\" he said, \"as I was when Mr. Lyne took his  trip around the world. I have received authority also from Mr. Lyne's  solicitors to continue the direction of the business until the Court  appoints a trustee.\"    Tarling eyed him narrowly.    \"What effect has this murder had upon you personally?\" he asked bluntly.  \"Does it enhance or depreciate your position?\"    Milburgh smiled.    \"Unhappily,\" he said, \"it enhances my position, because it gives me a  greater authority and a greater responsibility. I would that the occasion  had never arisen, Mr. Tarling.\"    \"I'm sure you do,\" said Tarling dryly, remembering Lyne's accusations  against the other's probity.    After a few commonplaces the men parted.    Milburgh! On the journey to Hertford Tarling analysed that urbane man,  and found him deficient in certain essential qualities; weighed him and  found him wanting in elements which should certainly form part of the  equipment of a trustworthy man.    At Hertford he jumped into a cab and gave the address.    \"Hillington Grove, sir? That's about two miles out,\" said the cabman.  \"It's Mrs. Rider you want?\"    Tarling nodded.    \"You ain't come with the young lady she was expecting?\" said the driver    \"No,\" replied Tarling in surprise.    \"I was told to keep my eyes open for a young lady,\" explained the cabman  vaguely.    A further surprise awaited the detective. He expected to discover that  Hillington Grove was a small suburban house bearing a grandiose title.  He was amazed when the cabman turned through a pair of impressive gates,  and drove up a wide drive of some considerable length, turning eventually  on to a gravelled space before a large mansion. It was hardly the kind of  home he would have expected for the parent of a cashier at Lyne's Store,  and his surprise was increased when the door was opened by a footman.    He was ushered into a drawing-room, beautifully and artistically  furnished. He began to think that some mistake had been made, and was  framing an apology to the mistress of the house, when the door opened and  a lady entered.    Her age was nearer forty than thirty, but she was still a beautiful woman  and carried herself with the air of a grand dame. She was graciousness  itself to the visitor, but Tarling thought he detected a note of anxiety  both in her mien and in her voice.    \"I'm afraid there's some mistake,\" he began. \"I have probably found the  wrong Mrs. Rider--I wanted to see Miss Odette Rider.\"    The lady nodded.    \"That is my daughter,\" she said. \"Have you any news of her? I am quite  worried about her.\"    \"Worried about her?\" said Tarling quickly. \"Why, what has happened? Isn't  she here?\"    \"Here?\" said Mrs. Rider, wide-eyed. \"Of course she is not.\"    \"But hasn't she been here?\" asked Tarling. \"Didn't she arrive here two  nights ago?\"    Mrs. Rider shook her head.    \"My daughter has not been,\" she replied. \"But she promised to come and  spend a few days with me, and last night I received a telegram--wait a  moment, I will get it for you.\"    She was gone a few moments and came back with a little buff form, which  she handed to the detective. He looked and read:         \"My visit cancelled. Do not write to me at flat. I will communicate       with you when I reach my destination.\"    The telegram had been handed in at the General Post Office, London, and  was dated nine o'clock--three hours, according to expert opinion, before  the murder was committed!          CHAPTER VII    THE WOMAN IN THE CASE      \"May I keep this telegram?\" asked Tarling.    The woman nodded. He saw that she was nervous, ill at ease and worried.    \"I can't quite understand why Odette should not come,\" she said."]]]
