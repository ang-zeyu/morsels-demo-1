They soon learned the  boundaries of this unfenced Park, and, as every one knows, they show a  different nature within its sacred limits. They no longer shun the face of  man, they neither fear nor attack him, and they are even more tolerant of  one another in this land of refuge.    Peace and plenty are the sum of earthly good; so, finding them here, the  wild creatures crowd into the Park from the surrounding country in numbers  not elsewhere to be seen.        [Illustration]    The Bears are especially numerous about the Fountain Hotel. In the woods, a  quarter of a mile away, is a smooth open place where the steward of the  hotel has all the broken and waste food put out daily for the Bears, and  the man whose work it is has become the Steward of the Bears' Banquet. Each  day it is spread, and each year there are more Bears to partake of it. It  is a common thing now to see a dozen Bears feasting there at one time. They  are of all kinds--Black, Brown, Cinnamon, Grizzly, Silvertip, Roachbacks,  big and small, families and rangers, from all parts of the vast surrounding  country. All seem to realize that in the Park no violence is allowed, and  the most ferocious of them have here put on a new behavior. Although  scores of Bears roam about this choice resort, and sometimes quarrel among  themselves, not one of them has ever yet harmed a man.        [Illustration]    Year after year they have come and gone. The passing travellers see them.  The men of the hotel know many of them well. They know that they show up  each summer during the short season when the hotel is in use, and that they  disappear again, no man knowing whence they come or whither they go.        [Illustration]    One day the owner of the Palette Ranch came through the Park. During his  stay at the Fountain Hotel, he went to the Bear Banquet Hall at high  meal-tide. There were several Blackbears feasting, but they made way for a  huge Silvertip Grizzly that came about sundown.        [Illustration]    \"That,\" said the man who was acting as guide, \"is the biggest Grizzly in  the Park; but he is a peaceable sort, or Lud knows what'd happen.\"    \"That!\" said the ranchman, in astonishment, as the Grizzly came hulking  nearer, and loomed up like a load of hay among the piney pillars of the  Banquet Hall. \"That! If that is not Meteetsee Wahb, I never saw a Bear in  my life! Why, that is the worst Grizzly that ever rolled a log in the Big  Horn Basin.\"    \"It ain't possible,\" said the other, \"for he's here every summer, July and  August, an' I reckon he don't live so far away.\"        [Illustration]    \"Well, that settles it,\" said the ranchman; \"July and August is just the  time we miss him on the range; and you can see for yourself that he is a  little lame behind and has lost a claw of his left front foot. Now I know  where he puts in his summers; but I did not suppose that the old reprobate  would know enough to behave himself away from home.\"    The big Grizzly became very well known during the successive hotel seasons.  Once only did he really behave ill, and that was the first season he  appeared, before he fully knew the ways of the Park.        [Illustration]    He wandered over to the hotel, one day, and in at the front door. In the  hall he reared up his eight feet of stature as the guests fled in terror;  then he went into the clerk's office. The man said: \"All right; if you need  this office more than I do, you can have it,\" and leaping over the counter,  locked himself in the telegraph-office to wire the superintendent of the  Park: \"Old Grizzly in the office now, seems to want to run hotel; may we  shoot?\"    The reply came: \"No shooting allowed in Park; use the hose.\" Which they  did, and, wholly taken by surprise, the Bear leaped over the counter too,  and ambled out the back way, with a heavy _thud-thudding_ of his feet, and  a rattling of his claws on the floor. He passed through the kitchen as he  went, and, picking up a quarter of beef, took it along.    This was the only time he was known to do ill, though on one occasion he  was led into a breach of the peace by another Bear. This was a large  she-Blackbear and a noted mischief-maker. She had a wretched, sickly cub  that she was very proud of--so proud that she went out of her way to seek  trouble on his behalf. And he, like all spoiled children, was the cause of  much bad feeling. She was so big and fierce that she could bully all the  other Blackbears, but when she tried to drive off old Wahb she received a  pat from his paw that sent her tumbling like a football. He followed her  up, and would have killed her, for she had broken the peace of the Park,  but she escaped by climbing a tree, from the top of which her miserable  little cub was apprehensively squealing at the pitch of his voice. So the  affair was ended; in future the Blackbear kept out of Wahb's way, and he  won the reputation of being a peaceable, well-behaved Bear. Most persons  believed that he came from some remote mountains where were neither guns  nor traps to make him sullen and revengeful.        [Illustration]              III      Every one knows that a Bitter-root Grizzly is a bad Bear. The Bitter-root  Range is the roughest part of the mountains. The ground is everywhere cut  up with deep ravines and overgrown with dense and tangled underbrush.    It is an impossible country for horses, and difficult for gunners, and  there is any amount of good Bear-pasture. So there are plenty of Bears and  plenty of trappers.        [Illustration]    The Roachbacks, as the Bitter-root Grizzlies are called, are a cunning and  desperate race. An old Roachback knows more about traps than half a dozen  ordinary trappers; he knows more about plants and roots than a whole  college of botanists. He can tell to a certainty just when and where to  find each kind of grub and worm, and he knows by a whiff whether the hunter  on his trail a mile away is working with guns, poison, dogs, traps, or all  of them together. And he has one general rule, which is an endless puzzle  to the hunter: \"Whatever you decide to do, do it quickly and follow it  right up.\" So when a trapper and a Roachback meet, the Bear at once makes  up his mind to run away as hard as he can, or to rush at the man and fight  to a finish.    The Grizzlies of the Bad Lands did not do this: they used to stand on their  dignity and growl like a thunder-storm, and so gave the hunters a chance to  play their deadly lightning; and lightning is worse than thunder any day.  Men can get used to growls that rumble along the ground and up one's legs  to the little house where one's courage lives; but Bears cannot get used to  45-90 soft-nosed bullets, and that is why the Grizzlies of the Bad Lands  were all killed off.    So the hunters have learned that they never know what a Roachback will do;  but they do know that he is going to be quick about it.    Altogether these Bitter-root Grizzlies have solved very well the problem of  life, in spite of white men, and are therefore increasing in their own wild  mountains.    Of course a range will hold only so many Bears, and the increase is crowded  out; so that when that slim young Bald-faced Roachback found he could not  hold the range he wanted, he went out perforce to seek his fortune in the  world.        [Illustration]    He was not a big Bear, or he would not have been crowded out; but he had  been trained in a good school, so that he was cunning enough to get on very  well elsewhere. How he wandered down to the Salmon River Mountains and did  not like them; how he traveled till he got among the barbwire fences of the  Snake Plains and of course could not stay there; how a mere chance turned  him from going eastward to the Park, where he might have rested; how he  made for the Snake River Mountains and found more hunters than berries; how  he crossed into the Tetons and looked down with disgust on the teeming man  colony of Jackson's Hole, does not belong to this history of Wahb. But when  Baldy Roachback crossed the Gros Ventre Range and over the Wind River  Divide to the head of the Graybull, he does come into the story, just as he  did into the country and the life of the Meteetsee Grizzly.    The Roachback had not found a man-sign since he left Jackson's Hole, and  here he was in a land of plenty of food. He feasted on all the delicacies  of the season, and enjoyed the easy, brushless country till he came on one  of Wahb's sign-posts.    \"Trespassers beware!\" it said in the plainest manner. The Roachback reared  up against it.    \"Thunder! what a Bear!\" The nose-mark was a head and neck above Baldy's  highest reach. Now, a simple Bear would have gone quietly away after this  discovery; but Baldy felt that the mountains owed him a living, and here  was a good one if he could keep out of the way of the big fellow. He nosed  about the place, kept a sharp lookout for the present owner, and went on  feeding wherever he ran across a good thing.        [Illustration]    A step or two from this ominous tree was an old pine stump. In the  Bitter-roots there are often mice-nests under such stumps, and Baldy jerked  it over to see. There was nothing. The stump rolled over against the  sign-post. Baldy had not yet made up his mind about it; but a new notion  came into his cunning brain. He turned his head on this side, then on  that. He looked at the stump, then at the sign, with his little pig-like  eyes. Then he deliberately stood up on the pine root, with his back to the  tree, and put his mark away up, a head at least above that of Wahb. He  rubbed his back long and hard, and he sought some mud to smear his head and  shoulders, then came back and made the mark so big, so strong, and so high,  and emphasized it with such claw-gashes in the bark, that it could be read  only in one way--a challenge to the present claimant from some monstrous  invader, who was ready, nay"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2503"],[0,"Myths and Legends of California and the Old Southwest (#7)"],[1,"he was so tired  he laid down the sack and peeped into it. He cut only a tiny hole, but  at once the Star People flew out and filled the heavens everywhere.    Then Utset and all the people came, and after Turkey passed, the door  was closed with a great rock so that the waters from below could not  follow them.    Then Utset looked for the sack with the Star People. She found it nearly  empty and could not tell where the stars had gone. The little beetle sat  by, very much frightened and very sad. But Utset was angry and said,  \"You are bad and disobedient. From this time forth, you shall be blind.\"  That is the reason the scarabaeus has no eyes, so the old ones say.    But the little fellow had saved a few of the stars by grasping the sack  and holding it fast. Utset placed these in the heavens. In one group she  placed seven--the great bear. In another, three. In another group she  placed the Pleiades, and threw the others far off into the sky.          The Flood and the Theft of Fire  Tolowa (Del Norte Co., Cal.)    Along time ago there came a great rain. It lasted a long time and the  water kept rising till all the valleys were submerged, and the Indian  tribes fled to the high lands. But the water rose, and though the  Indians fled to the highest point, all were swept away and drowned-all  but one man and one woman. They reached the very highest peak and were  saved. These two Indians ate the fish from the waters around them.    Then the waters subsided. All the game was gone, and all the animals.  But the children of these two Indians, when they died, became the  spirits of deer and bear and insects, and so the animals and insects  came back to the earth again.    The Indians had no fire. The flood had put out all the fires in the  world. They looked at the moon and wished they could secure fire from  it. Then the Spider Indians and the Snake Indians formed a plan to steal  fire. The Spiders wove a very light balloon, and fastened it by a long  rope to the earth. Then they climbed into the balloon and started for  the moon. But the Indians of the Moon were suspicious of the Earth  Indians. The Spiders said, \"We came to gamble.\" The Moon Indians were  much pleased and all the Spider Indians began to gamble with them. They  sat by the fire.    Then the Snake Indians sent a man to climb up the long rope from the  earth to the moon. He climbed the rope, and darted through the fire  before the Moon Indians understood what he had done. Then he slid down  the rope to earth again. As soon as he touched the earth he travelled  over the rocks, the trees, and the dry sticks lying upon the ground,  giving fire to each. Everything he touched contained fire. So the world  became bright again, as it was before the flood.    When the Spider Indians came down to earth again, they were immediately  put to death, for the tribes were afraid the Moon Indians might want  revenge.          Legend of the Flood in Sacramento Valley  Maidu (near Sacramento Valley, Cal.)    Long, long ago the Indians living in Sacramento Valley were happy.  Suddenly there came the swift sound of rushing waters, and the valley  became like Big Waters, which no man can measure. The Indians fled, but  many slept beneath the waves. Also the frogs and the salmon pursued them  and they ate many Indians. Only two who fled into the foothills escaped.  To these two, Great Man gave many children, and many tribes arose. But  one great chief ruled all the nation. The chief went out upon a wide  knoll overlooking Big Waters, and he knew that the plains of his people  were beneath the waves. Nine sleeps he lay on the knoll, thinking  thoughts of these great waters. Nine sleeps he lay without food, and his  mind was thinking always of one thing: How did this deep water cover the  plains of the world?    At the end of nine sleeps he was changed. He was not like himself. No  arrow could wound him. He was like Great Man for no Indian could slay  him. Then he spoke to Great Man and commanded him to banish the waters  from the plains of his ancestors. Great Man tore a hole in the mountain  side, so that the waters on the plains flowed into Big Waters. Thus the  Sacramento River was formed.          The Fable of the Animals  Karok (near Klamath River,. Cal.)    A great many hundred snows ago, Kareya, sitting on the Sacred Stool,  created the world. First, he made the fishes in the Big Water, then the  animals on the green land, and last of all, Man! But at first the  animals were all alike in power. No one knew which animals should be  food for others, and which should be food for man. Then Kareya ordered  them all to meet in one place, that Man might give each his rank and his  power. So the animals all met together one evening, when the sun was  set, to wait overnight for the coming of Man on the next morning. Kareya  also commanded Man to make bows and arrows, as many as there were  animals, and to give the longest one to the animal which was to have the  most power, and the shortest to the one which should have least power.  So he did, and after nine sleeps his work was ended, and the bows and  arrows which he had made were very many.    Now the animals, being all together, went to sleep, so they might be  ready to meet Man on the next morning. But Coyote was exceedingly  cunning--he was cunning above all the beasts. Coyote wanted the longest  bow and the greatest power, so he could have all the other animals for  his meat. He decided to stay awake all night, so that he would be first  to meet Man in the morning. So he laughed to himself and stretched his  nose out on his paw and pretended to sleep. About midnight he began to  be sleepy. He had to walk around the camp and scratch his eyes to keep  them open. He grew more sleepy, so that he had to skip and jump about to  keep awake. But he made so much noise, he awakened some of the other  animals. When the morning star came up, he was too sleepy to keep his  eyes open any longer. So he took two little sticks, and sharpened them  at the ends, and propped open his eyelids. Then he felt safe. He watched  the morning star, with his nose stretched along his paws, and fell  asleep. The sharp sticks pinned his eyelids fast together.    The morning star rose rapidly into the sky. The birds began to sing. The  animals woke up and stretched themselves, but still Coyote lay fast  asleep. When the sun rose, the animals went to meet Man. He gave the  longest bow to Cougar, so he had greatest power; the second longest he  gave to Bear; others he gave to the other animals, giving all but the  last to Frog. But the shortest one was left. Man cried out, \"What animal  have I missed?\" Then the animals began to look about and found Coyote  fast asleep, with his eyelids pinned together. All the animals began to  laugh, and they jumped upon Coyote and danced upon him. Then they led  him to Man, still blinded, and Man pulled out the sharp sticks and gave  him the shortest bow of all. It would hardly shoot an arrow farther than  a foot. All the animals laughed.    But Man took pity on Coyote, because he was now weaker even than Frog.  So at his request, Kareya gave him cunning, ten times more than before,  so that he was cunning above all the animals of the wood. Therefore  Coyote was friendly to Man and his children, and did many things for  them.          Coyote and Sun  Pai Ute (near Kern River, Cal.)    Along time ago, Coyote wanted to go to the sun. He asked Pokoh, Old Man,  to show him the trail. Coyote went straight out on this trail and he  travelled it all day. But Sun went round so that Coyote came back at  night to the place from which he started in the morning.    The next morning, Coyote asked Pokoh to show him the trail. Pokoh showed  him, and Coyote travelled all day and came back at night to the same  place again.    But the third day, Coyote started early and went out on the trail to the  edge of the world and sat down on the hole where the sun came up. While  waiting for the sun he pointed with his bow and arrow at different  places and pretended to shoot. He also pretended not to see the sun.  When Sun came up, he told Coyote to get out of his way. Coyote told him  to go around; that it was his trail. But Sun came up under him and he  had to hitch forward a little. After Sun came up a little farther, it  began to get hot on Coyote's shoulder, so he spit on his paw and rubbed  his shoulder. Then he wanted to ride up with the sun. Sun said, \"Oh, no\";  but Coyote insisted. So Coyote climbed up on Sun, and Sun started up the  trail in the sky. The trail was marked off into steps like a ladder. As  Sun went up he counted \"one, two, three,\" and so on. By and by Coyote  became very thirsty, and he asked Sun for a drink of water. Sun gave him  an acorn-cup full. Coyote asked him why he had no more. About noontime,  Coyote became very impatient. It was very hot. Sun told him to shut his  eyes. Coyote shut them, but opened them again. He kept opening and  shutting them all the afternoon. At night, when Sun came down, Coyote  took hold of a tree. Then he clambered off Sun and climbed down to the  earth.          The Course of the Sun  Sia (New Mexico)    Sussistinnako, the spider, said to the sun, \"My son, you will ascend and  pass over the world above. You will go from north to south. Return and  tell me what you think of it.\"    The sun said, on his return, \"Mother, I did as you bade me, and I did  not like the road.\"    Spider told him to ascend and pass over the world from west to the east.  On his return, the sun said,    \"It may be good for some, mother, but I did not like it.\"    Spider said, \"You will again ascend and pass over the straight road from  the east to the west. Return and tell me what you think of it.\"    That night the sun said, \"I am much contented. I like that road much.\"    Sussistinnako said, \"My son, you will ascend each day and pass over the  world from east to west.\"    Upon each day's journey"]]]
