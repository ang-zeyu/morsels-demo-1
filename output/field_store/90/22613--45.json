I asked a question: 'What will Browne like for breakfast,  Drayton?'    'If he's come back to his civilized tastes, you'd better open  that tin of sausages,' he said. 'You've got some squish, too,  haven't you? Don't give him that bush-tea of yours!'    I was up long before Drayton. I had secured Browne's confidences  before the sun had been risen an hour. 'I've had a sort of  miserable ague,' he said. 'A cold and hot fever has been plaguing  me. Some part of this last night has been savagely horrible. But  I've sweated pounds of my weight away, and my fever's gone.  Strange, isn't it?'    'Quite ordinary in this part of Africa,' I said, sharply and  minimizingly. I handed him a shirt, and he doffed his drenched  one. He did not tell me any more just then. His eyes watched me  in a dazed, miserable way. I asked him to excuse me, and went off  with Johannes to my service. When I came back his eyes were  clearer, they had less of their look of wan-hope.    'Sinister country, this Africa,' he said. 'I was infatuated with  her yesterday. Today I can't understand just what the attraction  was. Her desolate moors seemed to make me drunk. See how she's  served me! I never felt quite so sick as I've done most of this  last day and night. Just before I woke it seemed to me I saw them  in my dreams tens and twenties of her victims; men she's charmed  and led on and on, and demoralized, ruined, killed and buried,  and helped down-hill the way of the bottomless pit. I am better  now; but I'm shaken. How thankful I'll be if only I get out of  her, and can only stop thinking about her after that.'    I listened with grave attention. Then I gave him some bread and  sausages, and he ate away ravenously. How ever many cups of tea  did he drink afterwards?'    The above was all the avowal that Browne made to me. I do not  think that he said nearly as much to Drayton as he did to me.  Drayton plied me with questions that night, and I told him too  much, to my regret.    Months afterwards a copy of an undergraduate paper, containing a  fantasia on the events that I have recorded, reached me. It  comprised much African coloring and some little humor. I wonder  if it reached Browne or Mrs. Browne?    We got Browne home in little over a day. He hurried on,  oftentimes when we wanted to rest. He seemed as anxious to emerge  from the African desert as he had been to explore the deeps of  it. He looked rakish and wretched as he bumped about upon his  mule. His face was livid, and his black beard, that he used to  cut so formally, desperately out of trim. His eyes were strangely  bloodshot.    We reached home safely with our prize by noon on Saturday.  Browne, as I have said, was all for getting on fast, and when we  once started, his stubborn mount went well. It was won to  emulation by the willingness of our ponies, I imagine.    Mrs. Browne was delighted at her Gerald's return. Yet I think it  must have taken some months to restore her confidence in his  sanity. She had had a sore shock. Drayton and I, indeed, were  both discreet in our brief narratives of what had really  happened. But I was heedless enough to forget Johannes. I did not  caution him in time. So Mrs. Browne gathered rather a bizarre  account from him while we were at church on Sunday evening. It is  to her credit that, despite her thrift, she gave the boy a whole  gold sovereign.    The three travelers left by the slow down-train on the Monday  morning. I went to the station with them. I saw Drayton into a  smoking-carriage, and climbed in and sat with him. There was  still ten minutes' grace allowed us.    'Where's Browne, and where's Mrs. Browne?' I asked.    'Along there, ever so far!' he said; 'with Professor Ayres and  the Misses Ayres, and all sorts of good company. But, hullo! Look  there!'    Browne was coming up the platform towards the bookstall, looking  forlorn and sad.    'Ah! what can ail thee, wretched wight, Alone and palely  loitering?' murmured Drayton. 'It's a bad job for me, Jerry's  getting off-color like this. How's he going to train men for  Firsts next June, when he's gone in himself?'    'Oh. he'll pick up as soon as he gets out of Africa, never fear.'  I reassured him.    Browne loitered up to the stall and amassed two month-old English  magazines. Then he stood by the stall, looking on to the  distances near and far behind it. Our feverish contact had not  spoilt much of the landscape there as yet. Beyond a few railway  sheds showed some bushes, as it were, of wild cherry-blossom,  flaunting a true white under the sky's true blue. Spring colors  dressed the woodland behind them red and bronze, and also the two  famous colors of Faeryland. Behind that, again, the view was  spread out widely diverse, certain blue hills standing up very  delicately. Meanwhile in the near foreground some Kaffir herds  helped the picture not a little. They were driving their flock  between the white-blossomed bushes.    Browne stood a long while and watched that landscape. I would  have given something to have read his face all the while, but his  back was turned to us.    At last he began to pace up and down by the bookstall. Then he  stood to gaze again, scouring, as it seemed, the far distance  with eyes straining their utmost. Our eyes followed his.    Did not some ironstone kopjes rise up dimly to the north there?    Assuredly Browne saw those blue peaks and ridges, and remembered  them.    'Do you remember them?' I asked Drayton.    'Don't I just?' he said.    He began again in his chanting chorus tone: he was reading and  transposing from a pocket copy of Theocritus.    'They all call thee a \"gipsy,\" gracious Africa, and \"lean\" and  \"sunburnt,\" 'tis only I that call thee \"honey-pale.\" Yea, and the  violet is swart, and swart the lettered hyacinth, but yet these  flowers are chosen the first in garlands. . . . Ah, gracious  Africa, thy feet are fashioned like carven ivory, thy voice is  drowsy sweet, and thy ways, I cannot tell of them.'    The engine whistled. Browne roused himself to my intense relief,  and climbed into the train.    'Good-bye,' I called to him as they steamed away.    'Au revoir,' he called back to me.        THE SCENTED TOWN (A TRIPPER'S TALE)        It is now more than two years since I was invalided out of my  country parish one bitter March, and sent on a southern voyage. I  had ten weeks to recruit in, and I passed by the Mediterranean to  the eastern coast of Africa. It was hard to tear myself away from  Zanzibar, but at last I went on southward and struck up into the  wilder country of the central tableland. I meant to take the rail  for Cape Town when my time should be up.    It happened in Easter week that I camped out disconsolately, and  rose anxiously, having lost my way overnight. I had spent Easter  Day in a cathedral, or pro-cathedral, town, and was now on my way  to a certain mission. I had hoped to make it that last night  the third night of the journey but had somehow missed it in the  dark after a big effort. There seemed to be no native village  near, and no passers-by. My carriers were strangers to that  neighborhood, and I was afraid of going far past the house in  benighted wanderings, so I bent my resolution and lay down. I  rose just before the sun did. It was April and the dews were very  heavy.    From a rocky hill above me the baboons were barking. Just below  us was a fair stream with a rich grove of native trees on the  further bank. Some native gardens showed on the slope above. The  white path wound through them, then away among boulders, some of  them very big ones. While I watched the stream I saw a white body  of mist mounting up. Just at that moment the sun showed. As I  looked on the sacred sight I saw somebody coming down the path.  It was the man whose mission station I had been looking for. He  was coming through the long grass in a hurry. Soon he splashed  through the drift. After that he caught sight of me, and rushed  up to our camp, glowing. It was Leonard Reeve. He looked much the  same as he did that day in London three years before--dark, pale,  slight, earnest. I had been to his sendoff and gone down to  Victoria Docks with him. I had written to tell him; I was most  likely coming his way after Easter. He seemed ever so glad to see  me.    'But where were you off to?' I said.    'It's only a mile on that I'm going,' he answered. 'There's a  little chapel on that hill over there with some native villages  near by. I want to have an Easter service there.'    'Let me come,' said I. 'You can be back to breakfast here, can't  you, when we've done?'    He said he could. Even as he nodded I felt a little anxious when  I remembered that we had no meat of any sort left. I took Jack,  my head carrier, aside and asked him to do what he could while we  were gone. Couldn't he buy some eggs for salt, or do something  useful in the way of foraging? He said three words in kitchen  Kaffir that sounded hopeful.    Then I went on with my chill, damp little friend. One of the  coldest ways surely of taking a bath is to tramp through the long  grass (it is very long in that country) when it is drenched with  dew or rain. However it is all right if you are sturdy and in  good heart, and keep going a stirring pace, and never sit down  till you are dry again. My companion did not seem very buoyant,  though he made no complaint and trudged on without flagging. We  had a glorious service in a quaint church of wattles and earth  and grass on a hill-top. One way it looked over a great spread of  village gardens I think there were at least three villages in  sight. The other way it looked on some well-wooded uplands that  the eastern sun lighted tenderly. There were only a few people in  church at the end of the rite, though a great crowd was there at  the outset, and the 'Kyrie' and first two hymns raised the hill  echoes.

The next Argument (continues _Carneades_) that I shall urge against  _Themistius's_ Opinion shall be this, That as there are divers Bodies  whose _Analysis_ by Fire cannot reduce them into so many Heterogeneous  Substances or Ingregredients [Transcriber's Note: Ingredients] as  four, so there are others which may be reduc'd into more, as the Blood  (and divers other parts) of Men and other Animals, which yield when  analyz'd five distinct Substances, Phlegme, Spirit, Oyle, Salt and  Earth, as Experience has shewn us in distilling Mans Blood,  Harts-Horns, and divers other Bodies that belonging to the  Animal-Kingdom abound with not uneasily sequestrable Salt.

THE    SCEPTICAL CHYMIST.    _The First Part._      I am (sayes _Carneades_) so unwilling to deny _Eleutherius_ any thing,  that though, before the rest of the Company I am resolv'd to make good  the part I have undertaken of a Sceptick; yet I shall readily, since  you will have it so, lay aside for a while the Person of an Adversary  to the Peripateticks and Chymists; and before I acquaint you with my  Objections against their Opinions, acknowledge to you what may be  (whether truly or not) tollerably enough added, in favour of a certain  number of Principles of mixt Bodies, to that grand and known Argument  from the _Analysis_ of compound Bodies, which I may possibly  hereafter be able to confute.    And that you may the more easily Examine, and the better Judge of what  I have to say, I shall cast it into a pretty number of distinct  Propositions, to which I shall not premise any thing; because I take  it for granted, that you need not be advertis'd, that much of what I  am to deliver, whether for or against a determinate number of  Ingredients of mix'd Bodies, may be indifferently apply'd to the four  Peripatetick Elements, and the three Chymical Principles, though  divers of my Objections will more peculiarly belong to these last  nam'd, because the Chymical _Hypothesis_ seeming to be much more  countenanc'd by Experience then the other, it will be expedient to  insist chiefly upon the disproving of that; especially since most of  the Arguments that are imploy'd against it, may, by a little  variation, be made to conclude, at least as strongly against the less  plausible, _Aristotelian_ Doctrine.    To proceed then to my Propositions, I shall begin with this. That    [Sidenote: Propos. I.]    _It seems not absurd to conceive that at the first Production of mixt  Bodies, the Universal Matter whereof they among other Parts of the  Universe consisted, was actually divided into little Particles of  several sizes and shapes variously mov'd._    This (sayes _Carneades_) I suppose you will easily enough allow. For  besides that which happens in the Generation, Corruption, Nutrition,  and wasting of Bodies, that which we discover partly by our  _Microscopes_ of the extream littlenesse of even the scarce sensible  parts of Concretes; and partly by the Chymical Resolutions of mixt  Bodies, and by divers other Operations of Spagyrical Fires upon them,  seems sufficiently to manifest their consisting of parts very minute  and of differing Figures. And that there does also intervene a various  local Motion of such small Bodies, will scarce be denied; whether we  chuse to grant the Origine of Concretions assign'd by _Epicurus_, or  that related by _Moses_. For the first, as you well know, supposes not  only all mixt Bodies, but all others to be produc'd by the various  and casual occursions of Atomes, moving themselves to and fro by an  internal Principle in the Immense or rather Infinite _Vacuum_. And as  for the inspir'd Historian, He, informing us that the great and Wise  Author of Things did not immediately create Plants, Beasts, Birds, &c.  but produc'd them out of those portions of the pre-existent, though  created, Matter, that he calls Water and Earth, allows us to conceive,  that the constituent Particles whereof these new Concretes were to  consist, were variously moved in order to their being connected into  the Bodies they were, by their various Coalitions and Textures, to  compose.    But (continues _Carneades_) presuming that the first Proposition needs  not be longer insisted on, I will pass on to the second, and tell you  that    [Sidenote: Propos. II.]    _Neither is it impossible that of these minute Particles divers of the  smallest and neighbouring ones were here and there associated into  minute Masses or Clusters, and did by their Coalitions constitute  great store of such little primary Concretions or Masses as were not  easily dissipable into such Particles as compos'd them._    To what may be deduc'd, in favour of this Assertion, from the Nature  of the Thing it self, I will add something out of Experience, which  though I have not known it used to such a purpose, seems to me more  fairly to make out that there May be Elementary Bodies, then the more  questionable Experiments of Peripateticks and Chymists prove that  there Are such. I consider then that Gold will mix and be colliquated  not only with Silver, Copper, Tin and Lead, but with Antimony,  _Regulus Martis_ and many other Minerals, with which it will compose  Bodies very differing both from Gold, and the other Ingredients of the  resulting Concretes. And the same Gold will also by common _Aqua  Regis_, and (I speak it knowingly) by divers other _Menstruums_ be  reduc'd into a seeming Liquor, in so much that the Corpuscles of Gold  will, with those of the _Menstruum_, pass through Cap-Paper, and with  them also coagulate into a Crystalline Salt. And I have further try'd,  that with a small quantity of a certain Saline Substance I prepar'd,  I can easily enough sublime Gold into the form of red Crystalls of a  considerable length; and many other wayes may Gold be disguis'd, and  help to constitute Bodies of very differing Natures both from It and  from one another, and neverthelesse be afterward reduc'd to the  self-same Numerical, Yellow, Fixt, Ponderous and Malleable Gold it was  before its commixture. Nor is it only the fixedst of Metals, but the  most fugitive, that I may employ in favour of our Proposition: for  Quicksilver will with divers Metals compose an _Amalgam_, with divers  _Menstruums_ it seems to be turn'd into a Liquor, with _Aqua fortis_  will be brought into either a red or white Powder or precipitate, with  Oyl of Vitriol into a pale Yellow one, with Sulphur it will compose a  blood-red and volatile Cinaber, with some Saline Bodies it will ascend  in form of a Salt which will be dissoluble in water; with _Regulus_ of  Antimony and Silver I have seen it sublim'd into a kinde of Crystals,  with another Mixture I reduc'd it into a malleable Body, into a hard  and brittle Substance by another: And some there are who affirm, that  by proper Additaments they can reduce Quicksilver into Oyl, nay into  Glass, to mention no more. And yet out of all these exotick Compounds,  we may recover the very same running Mercury that was the main  Ingredient of them, and was so disguis'd in them. Now the Reason  (proceeds _Carneades_) that I have represented these things concerning  Gold and Quicksilver, is, That it may not appear absurd to conceive,  that such little primary Masses or Clusters, as our Proposition  mentions, may remain undissipated, notwithstanding their entring into  the composition of various Concretions, since the Corpuscle of Gold  and Mercury, though they be not primary Concretions of the most minute  Particles or matter, but confessedly mixt Bodies, are able to concurre  plentifully to the composition of several very differing Bodies,  without losing their own Nature or Texture, or having their cohaesion  violated by the divorce of their associated parts or Ingredients.    Give me leave to add (sayes _Eleutherius_) on this occasion, to what  you now observ'd, that as confidently as some Chymists, and other  modern Innovators in Philosophy are wont to object against the  Peripateticks, That from the mixture of their four Elements there  could arise but an inconsiderable variety of compound Bodies; yet if  the _Aristotelians_ were but half as well vers'd in the works of  Nature as they are in the Writings of their Master, the propos'd  Objection would not so calmly triumph, as for want of Experiments they  are fain to suffer it to do. For if we assigne to the Corpuscles,  whereof each Element consists, a peculiar size and shape, it may  easily enough be manifested, That such differingly figur'd Corpuscles  may be mingled in such various Proportions, and may be connected so  many several wayes, that an almost incredible number of variously  qualified Concretes may be compos'd of them. Especially since the  Corpuscles of one Element may barely, by being associated among  themselves, make up little Masses of differing size and figure from  their constituent parts: and since also to the strict union of such  minute Bodies there seems oftentimes nothing requisite, besides the  bare Contact of a great part of their Surfaces. And how great a  variety of _Phaenomena_ the same matter, without the addition of any  other, and only several ways dispos'd or contexed, is able to exhibit,  may partly appear by the multitude of differing Engins which by the  contrivances of skilful Mechanitians, and the dexterity of expert  Workmen, may be made of Iron alone.
