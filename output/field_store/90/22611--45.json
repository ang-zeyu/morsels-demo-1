[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22832"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Canterbury [2nd ed.] (#7)"],[1,"above that  of all other ages is the skill which it displays in the use of towers of  different heights, breaking the dull straight line of the roof and  carrying the eye gradually up to the loftiest point of the building.  Canterbury presents an excellent example of the beauty of this  subordination of lower towers to the chief; we invite the visitor, when  looking at the exterior, to compare it mentally, on the one hand, with the  dull severity of the roof line of a Greek temple, and on the other, to  take a fair example of modern so-called Gothic, with the ugly straight  line of the Houses of Parliament, as seen from the Lambeth Embankment,  broken only by the two stark and stiff erections at each end. The two  towers at the west end of Canterbury were not always uniform. At the  northern corner an old Norman tower formerly uplifted a leaden spire one  hundred feet high. This rather anomalous arrangement must have had a  decidedly lopsided effect, and it is probable that the appearance of the  cathedral was changed very much for the better when the spire, which had  been taken down in 1705, was replaced by Mr. Austin in 1840, by a tower  uniform with the southernmost tower, called the Chicele or Oxford steeple:  this tower was completed by Prior Goldstone, who, during his tenure of  office from 1449-68, also built the Lady Chapel. On its south side stands  the porch, with a remarkable central niche, which formerly contained a  representation of Becket's martyrdom. The figures of the Archbishop's  assassins now no longer remain; but their place has been filled up with  figures of various worthies who have lived under the shadow of the  cathedral. Dean Alford suggested, about 1863, that the many vacant niches  should be peopled in this manner, and since then the work has proceeded  steadily. The western towers are built each of six stages: each of the two  upper tiers contains two two-light windows, while below there is a large  four-light window uniform with the windows of the aisles. The base tier is  ornamented with rich panelling. The parapet is battlemented and the angles  are finished with fine double pinnacles. At the west end there is a large  window of seven lights, with three transoms. The gable contains a window  of very curious shape, filled with intricate tracery. The space above the  aisle windows is ornamented with quatrefoiled squares, and the clerestory  is pierced by windows of three lights. In the main transept there is a  fine perpendicular window of eight lights; the choir, or south-east  transept, has a Norman front, with arcades, and a large round window; also  an arcaded west turret surmounted by a short spire. Beyond this, the line  is again broken by the projection of St. Anselm's so-called Tower; this  chapel hardly merits such a title, unless we adopt the theory that it, and  the corresponding building on the north side, were at one time a good deal  more lofty, but lost their upper portions at the time of the great fire.  The end of the cathedral has a rather untidy appearance, owing to the fact  that the exterior of the corona was never completed. On the northern side  the building is so closely interwoven with the cloister and monastic  buildings that it can only be considered in conjunction with them. The  length of the cathedral is 514 feet, the height of the central tower 235  feet, and that of the western towers 130 feet.    The chief interest of ancient buildings to the ordinary observer, as apart  from the architectural specialist, is the fact that they are after all the  most authentic documents in our possession from which we can gain any  insight into the lives and modes of thought of our ancestors. To tell us  how ordinary men lived and busied themselves is beneath the dignity of  history. As Carlyle says: \"The thing I want to see is not Redbook Lists,  and Court Calendars, and Parliamentary Registers, but the _Life of Man_ in  England: what men did, thought, suffered, enjoyed; ... Mournful, in truth,  is it to behold what the business 'called History' in these so enlightened  and illuminated times, still continues to be. Can you gather from it, read  till your eyes go out, any dimmest shadow of an answer to that great  question: How men lived and had their being; were it but economically, as,  what wages they got, and what they bought with these? Unhappily they  cannot.... History, as it stands all bound up in gilt volumes, is but a  shade more instructive than the wooden volumes of a backgammon-board.\"  Most of us have felt, at one time or another, the truth of these words,  though it is only fair to add that the fault lies not so much at the door  of the modern historian as of our ancestors themselves, who were too busy  with fighting and revelling to leave any but the most meagre account of  their own lives behind them; so that \"Redbook Lists and Parliamentary  Registers\" are all that the veracious chronicler, who will not let his  imagination run riot, can find to put before us. But happily, in the  wildest days of the Middle Ages, there were found some peace-loving souls  who preferred to drone away their lives in quiet meditation behind the  walls of the great monasteries, undisturbed by the clash of swords. Some  outlet had to be found for their innate energies and their intense  religious enthusiasm; missionary zeal had not yet been invented, and the  writing of books would have seemed to them a waste of good parchment, for  in their eyes the Scriptures and the Aristotelian writings supplied all  the food that the most voracious intellect could crave for. So they  applied all their genius--and it is probable that the flower of the  European race, as far as intelligence and culture are concerned, was  gathered in those days into the Church--and all the ecstatic fervour of  their religious devotion, the strength of which men of these latter days  can hardly realize, to the construction of beautiful buildings for the  worship of God. They have written a history in stone, from which a  thoughtful student can supply much that is left out by the dry-as-dust  annalists, for it is not only the history, but the actual result and  expression, of the lives of the most gifted men of the Middle Ages.    If we would read this history aright it is necessary that we should look  at it as far as possible, as it was originally published. If the old  binding has been torn off, and the volume hedged in by a crowd of modern  literature, we must try to put these aside and consider the book as it was  first issued; in other words, to drop metaphor altogether, in considering  a building like Canterbury Cathedral, we must forget the busy little  country town, with its crowded streets and noisy railway stations, though,  from one point of view, the contrast that they present is agreeable and  valuable, and try to conceive the church as it once stood, the centre of a  harmonious group of monastic buildings.    The founder of the monastic system in the West was the famous Benedict of  Nursia, who had adapted the strict code of St. Basil, mitigating its  severity, and making it more in accordance with the climate, manners,  and general circumstances of Western peoples. His code was described by  Gregory the Great as \"excellent in its discretion, lucid in its  expression\"--_discretione praecipuam sermone luculentam_. He founded the  monasteries of Montecassino and Subiaco in the beginning of the sixth  century. In the ninth and tenth centuries--the worst period of the Dark  Ages--corruption and laxity pervaded society in general, and the  Benedictine monasteries especially. At the end of this deplorable epoch  many efforts were made in the direction of reform. Gregory the Great  himself was a member of the Benedictine brotherhood; so also was  Augustine, who founded the great monastery of Christ Church. The venerable  Bede relates that \"when Augustine, the first Archbishop of Canterbury,  assumed the episcopal throne in that royal city, he recovered therein,  by the king's assistance, a church which, as he was told, had been  constructed by the original labour of Roman believers. This church he  consecrated in the name of the Saviour, our God and Lord Jesus Christ, and  there he established an habitation for himself and all his successors.\"  This was the Basilica-Church, mentioned in an earlier part of this work,  an imitation of the original Basilica of St. Peter at Rome. Augustine's  monastery was handsomely endowed. A large stretch of country was given to  the monks, and they were the first who brought the soil into cultivation,  and built churches and preached in them. \"The monks,\" says Bede, \"were the  principal of those who came to the work of preaching.\" In the city itself  there were thirty-two \"mansurae\" or mansions, held by the clergy, rendering  35_s._ a year, and a mill worth 5_s._ per annum. Augustine's monastery  lived and prospered--though, as we shall see, it did not escape the  general corruption of the eighth and ninth centuries--until the time of  the Norman invasion. In 1067 a fire destroyed the Saxon cathedral and the  greater part of the monastic buildings. But the year 1070 marks an epoch  in the history of the monastery, for it was then that William the  Conqueror having deposed Stigand, the Saxon Primate, invited Lanfranc, the  Abbot of Caen, to accept the vacant see. He \"being overcome by the will of  God as much as by the apostolic authority, passed over into England, and,  not forgetful of the object for which he had come, directed all his  endeavours to the correction of the manners of his people, and settling  the state of the Church. And first he laboured to renew the church of  Canterbury ... and built also necessary offices for the use of the monks;  and (which is very remarkable) he caused to be brought over the sea in  swift sailing vessels squared stones from Caen in order to build with. He  also built a house for his own dwelling near the church, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#7)"],[1,"loft, was to win, for one that  returns to his neighborhood merely, without immediately reporting at  home, is of little use as a letter-carrier.    The Homing Pigeon used to be called the Carrier because it carried  messages, but here I found that name restricted to the show bird, the  creature with absurdly developed wattles; the one that carries the  messages is now called the Homer, or Homing Pigeon--the bird that  always comes home. These Pigeons are not of any special color, nor have  they any of the fancy adornments of the kind that figure in Bird shows.  They are not bred for style, but for speed and for their mental gifts.  They must be true to their home, able to return to it without fail. The  sense of direction is now believed to be located in the bony labyrinth  of the ear. There is no creature with finer sense of locality and  direction than a good Homer, and the only visible proofs of it are the  great bulge on each side of the head over the ears, and the superb  wings that complete his equipment to obey the noble impulse of  home-love. Now the mental and physical equipments of the last lot of  young birds were to be put to test.    Although there were plenty of witnesses, I thought it best to close all  but one of the pigeon-doors and stand ready to shut that behind the  first arrival.    I shall never forget the sensations of that day. I had been warned:  \"They start at 12; they should be here at 12:30; but look out, they  come like a whirlwind. You hardly see them till they're in.\"    We were ranged along the inside of the loft, each with an eye to a  crack or a partly closed pigeon-door, anxiously scanning the  southwestern horizon, when one shouted: \"Look out--here they come!\"  Like a white cloud they burst into view, low skimming over the city  roofs, around a great chimney pile, and in two seconds after first  being seen they were back. The flash of white, the rush of pinions,  were all so sudden, so short, that, though preparing, I was unprepared.  I was at the only open door. A whistling arrow of blue shot in, lashed  my face with its pinions, and passed. I had hardly time to drop the  little door, as a yell burst from the men, \"Arnaux! Arnaux! I told you  he would. Oh, he's a darling; only three months old and a winner--he's  a little darling!\" and Arnaux's owner danced, more for joy in his bird  than in the purse he had won.    The men sat or kneeled and watched him in positive reverence as he  gulped a quantity of water, then turned to the food-trough.    \"Look at that eye, those wings, and did you ever see such a breast? Oh,  but he's the real grit!\" so his owner prattled to the silent ones whose  birds had been defeated.    That was the first of Arnaux's exploits. Best of fifty birds from a  good loft, his future was bright with promise.    He was invested with the silver anklet of the Sacred Order of the High  Homer. It bore his number, 2590 C, a number which to-day means much to  all men in the world of the Homing Pigeon.    In that trial flight from Elizabeth only forty birds had returned. It  is usually so. Some were weak and got left behind, some were foolish  and strayed. By this simple process of flight selection the  pigeon-owners keep improving their stock. Of the ten, five were seen no  more, but five returned later that day, not all at once, but straggling  in; the last of the loiterers was a big, lubberly Blue Pigeon. The man  in the loft at the time called: \"Here comes that old sap-headed Blue  that Jakey was betting on. I didn't suppose he would come back, and I  didn't care, neither, for it's my belief he has a streak of Pouter.\"    The Big Blue, also called \"Corner-box\" from the nest where he was  hatched, had shown remarkable vigor from the first. Though all were  about the same age, he had grown faster, was bigger, and incidentally  handsomer, though the fanciers cared little for that. He seemed fully  aware of his importance, and early showed a disposition to bully his  smaller cousins. His owner prophesied great things of him, but Billy,  the stable-man, had grave doubts over the length of his neck, the  bigness of his crop, his carriage, and his over-size. \"A bird can't  make time pushing a bag of wind ahead of him. Them long legs is dead  weight, an' a neck like that ain't got no gimp in it,\" Billy would  grunt disparagingly as he cleaned out the loft of a morning.      II    The training of the birds went on after this at regular times. The  distance from home, of the start, was \"jumped\" twenty-five or thirty  miles farther each day, and its direction changed till the Homers knew  the country for one hundred and fifty miles around New York. The  original fifty birds dwindled to twenty, for the rigid process weeds  out not only the weak and ill-equipped, but those also who may have  temporary ailments or accidents, or who may make the mistake of  over-eating at the start. There were many fine birds in that flight,  broad-breasted, bright-eyed, long-winged creatures, formed for swiftest  flight, for high unconscious emprise, for these were destined to be  messengers in the service of man in times of serious need. Their colors  were mostly white, blue, or brown. They wore no uniform, but each and  all of the chosen remnant had the brilliant eye and the bulging ears of  the finest Homer blood; and, best and choicest of all, nearly always  first among them was little Arnaux. He had not much to distinguish him  when at rest, for now all of the band had the silver anklet, but in the  air it was that Arnaux showed his make, and when the opening of the  hamper gave the order \"Start,\" it was Arnaux that first got under way,  soared to the height deemed needful to exclude all local influence,  divined the road to home, and took it, pausing not for food, drink, or  company.    Notwithstanding Billy's evil forecasts, the Big Blue of the Corner-box  was one of the chosen twenty. Often he was late in returning; he never  was first, and sometimes when he came back hours behind the rest, it  was plain that he was neither hungry nor thirsty, sure signs that he  was a loiterer by the way. Still he had come back; and now he wore on  his ankle, like the rest, the sacred badge and a number from the roll  of possible fame. Billy despised him, set him in poor contrast with  Arnaux, but his owner would reply: \"Give him a chance;'soon ripe, soon  rotten,' an' I always notice the best bird is the slowest to show up at  first.\"    Before a year little Arnaux had made a record. The hardest of all work  is over the sea, for there is no chance of aid from landmarks; and the  hardest of all times at sea is in fog, for then even the sun is blotted  out and there is nothing whatever for guidance. With memory, sight, and  hearing unavailable, the Homer has one thing left, and herein is his  great strength, the inborn sense of direction. There is only one thing  that can destroy this, and that is fear, hence the necessity of a stout  little heart between those noble wings.    Arnaux, with two of his order, in course of training, had been shipped  on an ocean steamer bound for Europe. They were to be released out of  sight of land, but a heavy fog set in and forbade the start. The  steamer took them onward, the intention being to send them back with  the next vessel. When ten hours out the engine broke down, the fog  settled dense over the sea, and the vessel was adrift and helpless as a  log. She could only whistle for assistance, and so far as results were  concerned, the captain might as well have wigwagged. Then the Pigeons  were thought of. Starback, 2592 C, was first selected. A message for  help was written on waterproof paper, rolled up, and lashed to his  tail-feathers on the under side. He was thrown into the air and  disappeared. Half an hour later, a second, the Big Blue Corner-box,  2600 C, was freighted with a letter. He flew up, but almost immediately  returned and alighted on the rigging. He was a picture of pigeon fear;  nothing could induce him to leave the ship. He was so terrorized that  he was easily caught and ignominiously thrust back into the coop.    Now the third was brought out, a small, chunky bird. The shipmen did  not know him, but they noted down from his anklet his name and number,  Arnaux, 2590 C. It meant nothing to them. But the officer who held him  noted that his heart did not beat so wildly as that of the last bird.  The message was taken from the Big Blue. It ran:      10 A.M., Tuesday.    We broke our shaft two hundred and ten miles out from New York; we are  drifting helplessly in the fog. Send out a tug as soon as possible. We  are whistling one long, followed at once by one short, every sixty  seconds.    (Signed)  THE CAPTAIN.      This was rolled up, wrapped in waterproof film, addressed to the  Steamship Company, and lashed to the under side of Arnaux's middle  tail-feather.    When thrown into the air, he circled round the ship, then round again  higher, then again higher in a wider circle, and he was lost to view;  and still higher till quite out of sight and feeling of the ship. Shut  out from the use of all his senses now but one, he gave himself up to  that. Strong in him it was, and untrammelled of that murderous despot  Fear. True as a needle to the Pole went Arnaux now, no hesitation, no  doubts; within one minute of leaving the coop he was speeding straight  as a ray of light for the loft where he was born, the only place on  earth where he could be made content.    That afternoon Billy was on duty when the whistle of fast wings was  heard; a blue Flyer flashed into the loft and made for the  water-trough. He was gulping down mouthful after mouthful, when Billy  gasped: \"Why, Arnaux, it's you, you beauty.\" Then, with the quick habit  of the pigeon-man, he pulled out his watch and marked the time, 2:40  P.M. A glance showed the tie string on the tail. He shut the door and  dropped the catching-net quickly over Arnaux's head. A moment"]]]
