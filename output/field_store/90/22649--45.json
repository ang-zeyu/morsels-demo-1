But this is easily explained: a man intent  upon squaring the circle will see squares in circles wherever he looks,  and sometimes he will find them.    In disputed cases of money claims, the king adhered strictly to  established practice, and consulted persons learned in the law. He  seldom decided a cause on his own judgment, and he showed great temper  and patience in bearing with rough language from irritated plaintiffs  and defendants, from the infirm, and from old men beyond eighty.  That humble petitioners might not be baulked in having access to the  \"fountain of justice,\" he caused an iron box to be suspended by a chain  from the windows of his sleeping apartment. Every morning he ordered  the box to be opened before him, and listened to all the placets at full  length. Even in this simple process he displayed abundant cautiousness.  For, having forgotten what little of the humanities he had mastered in  his youth, he would hand the paper to a secretary whose business it was  to read it out before him; after which operation the man of letters was  sent into an inner room, and the petition was placed in the hands of  a second scribe. Once it so happened by the bungling of the deceitful  kayasths(clerks) that an important difference was found to occur in the  same sheet. So upon strict inquiry one secretary lost his ears and  the other his right hand. After this petitions were rarely if ever  falsified.    The Raja Vikram also lost no time in attacking the cities and towns and  villages of his enemies, but the people rose to a man against him, and  hewing his army to pieces with their weapons, vanquished him. This took  place so often that he despaired of bringing all the earth under the  shadow of his umbrella.    At length on one occasion when near a village he listened to a  conversation of the inhabitants. A woman having baked some cakes was  giving them to her child, who leaving the edges would eat only the  middle. On his asking for another cake, she cried, \"This boy's way is  like Vikram's in his attempt to conquer the world!\" On his inquiring  \"Mother, why, what am I doing; and what has Vikram done?\"    \"Thou, my boy,\" she replied, \"throwing away the outside of the cake  eatest the middle only. Vikram also in his ambition, without subduing  the frontiers before attacking the towns, invades the heart of the  country and lays it waste. On that account, both the townspeople and  others rising, close upon him from the frontiers to the centre, and  destroy his army. That is his folly.\"    Vikram took notice of the woman's words. He strengthened his army and  resumed his attack on the provinces and cities, beginning with the  frontiers, reducing the outer towns and stationing troops in the  intervals. Thus he proceeded regularly with his invasions. After a  respite, adopting the same system and marshalling huge armies, he  reduced in regular course each kingdom and province till he became  monarch of the whole world.    It so happened that one day as Vikram the Brave sat upon the  judgment-seat, a young merchant, by name Mal Deo, who had lately arrived  at Ujjayani with loaded camels and elephants, and with the reputation  of immense wealth, entered the palace court. Having been received with  extreme condescension, he gave into the king's hand a fruit which he had  brought in his own, and then spreading a prayer carpet on the floor he  sat down. Presently, after a quarter of an hour, he arose and went away.  When he had gone the king reflected in his mind: \"Under this disguise,  perhaps, is the very man of whom the giant spoke.\" Suspecting this, he  did not eat the fruit, but calling the master of the household he gave  the present to him, ordering him to keep it in a very careful manner.  The young merchant, however, continued every day to court the honour of  an interview, each time presenting a similar gift.    By chance one morning Raja Vikram went, attended by his ministers, to  see his stables. At this time the young merchant also arrived there, and  in the usual manner placed a fruit in the royal hand. As the king  was thoughtfully tossing it in the air, it accidentally fell from his  fingers to the ground. Then the monkey, who was tethered amongst the  horses to draw calamities from their heads,[34] snatched it up and tore  it to pieces. Whereupon a ruby of such size and water came forth that  the king and his ministers, beholding its brilliancy, gave vent to  expressions of wonder.    Quoth Vikram to the young merchant severely--for his suspicions were now  thoroughly roused--\"Why hast thou given to us all this wealth?\"    \"O great king,\" replied Mal Deo, demurely, \"it is written in the  scriptures (shastra) 'Of Ceremony' that 'we must not go empty-handed  into the presence of the following persons, namely, Rajas, spiritual  teachers, judges, young maidens, and old women whose daughters we would  marry.' But why, O Vikram, cost thou speak of one ruby only, since in  each of the fruits which I have laid at thy feet there is a similar  jewel?\" Having heard this speech, the king said to the master of his  household, \"Bring all the fruits which I have entrusted to thee.\" The  treasurer, on receiving the royal command, immediately brought them,  and having split them, there was found in each one a ruby, one and all  equally perfect in size and water. Raja Vikram beholding such treasures  was excessively pleased. Having sent for a lapidary, he ordered him to  examine the rubies, saying, \"We cannot take anything with us out of this  world. Virtue is a noble quality to possess here below--so tell justly  what is the value of each of these gems.[35]\"    To so moral a speech the lapidary replied, \"Maha-Raja[36]! thou hast  said truly; whoever possesses virtue, possesses everything; virtue  indeed accompanies us always, and is of advantage in both worlds. Hear,  O great king! each gem is perfect in colour, quality and beauty. If I  were to say that the value of each was ten million millions of suvarnas  (gold pieces), even then thou couldst not understand its real worth. In  fact, each ruby would buy one of the seven regions into which the earth  is divided.\"    The king on hearing this was delighted, although his suspicions were  not satisfied; and, having bestowed a robe of honour upon the lapidary,  dismissed him. Thereon, taking the young merchant's hand, he led him  into the palace, seated him upon his own carpet in presence of the  court, and began to say, \"My entire kingdom is not worth one of these  rubies: tell me how it is that thou who buyest and sellest hast given me  such and so many pearls?\"    Mal Deo replied: \"O great king, the speaking of matters like the  following in public is not right; these things--prayers, spells, drugs,  good qualities, household affairs, the eating of forbidden food, and the  evil we may have heard of our neighbour--should not be discussed in full  assembly. Privately I will disclose to thee my wishes. This is the  way of the world; when an affair comes to six ears, it does not remain  secret; if a matter is confided to four ears it may escape further  hearing; and if to two ears even Brahma the Creator does not know it;  how then can any rumour of it come to man?\"    Having heard this speech, Raja Vikram took Mal Deo aside, and began to  ask him, saying, \"O generous man! you have given me so many rubies, and  even for a single day you have not eaten food with me; I am exceedingly  ashamed, tell me what you desire.\"    \"Raja,\" said the young merchant, \"I am not Mal Deo, but Shanta-Shil,[37]  a devotee. I am about to perform spells, incantations and magical rites  on the banks of the river Godavari, in a large smashana, a cemetery  where bodies are burned. By this means the Eight Powers of Nature will  all become mine. This thing I ask of you as alms, that you and the young  prince Dharma Dhwaj will pass one night with me, doing my bidding. By  you remaining near me my incantations will be successful.\"    The valiant Vikram nearly started from his seat at the word cemetery,  but, like a ruler of men, he restrained his face from expressing his  feelings, and he presently replied, \"Good, we will come, tell us on what  day!\"    \"You are to come to me,\" said the devotee, \"armed, but without  followers, on the Monday evening the 14th of the dark half of the month  Bhadra.[38]\" The Raja said: \"Do you go your ways, we will certainly  come.\" In this manner, having received a promise from the king, and  having taken leave, the devotee returned to his house: thence he  repaired to the temple, and having made preparations, and taken all the  necessary things, he went back into the cemetery and sat down to his  ceremonies.    The valiant Vikram, on the other hand, retired into an inner apartment,  to consult his own judgment about an adventure with which, for fear of  ridicule, he was unwilling to acquaint even the most trustworthy of his  ministers.    In due time came the evening moon's day, the 14th of the dark half of  the month Bhadra. As the short twilight fell gloomily on earth, the  warrior king accompanied by his son, with turband-ends tied under their  chins, and with trusty blades tucked under their arms ready for foes,  human, bestial, or devilish, slipped out unseen through the palace  wicket, and took the road leading to the cemetery on the river bank.    Dark and drear was the night. Urged by the furious blast of the  lingering winter-rains, masses of bistre-coloured cloud, like the forms  of unwieldy beasts, rolled heavily over the firmament plain. Whenever  the crescent of the young moon, rising from an horizon sable as the sad  Tamala's hue,[39] glanced upon the wayfarers, it was no brighter than  the fine tip of an elephant's tusk protruding from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24001"],[0,"The Physical Life of Woman: Advice to the Maiden, Wife and Mother (#7)"],[1,"  The once light-hearted girl inclines to reveries; she seeks solitude;  her mother surprises her in causeless tears; her teacher discovers an  unwonted inattention to her studies, a less retentive memory, a  disinclination to mental labor; her father misses her accustomed  playfulness; he, perhaps, is annoyed by her listlessness and inertia.  What does it all mean? What is the matter with the girl?    Mother, teacher, father, it is for you to know the answers to these  questions. You have guarded this girl through years of helpless infancy  and thoughtless childhood. At the peril of her life, and of what is of  more value than life, do not now relax your vigilance.

The  mothers weep, indeed; but little do they realize that it is because they  have neglected to cherish them as was their duty, that the Lord of  Paradise has taken them back unto Himself.      THE COMPLETION OF PUBERTY.    The symptoms increase until at length the system has acquired the  necessary strength, and furnished itself with reserve forces enough to  complete its transformation. Then the monthly flow commences.    In thoroughly healthy girls it continues to recur at regular intervals,  from twenty-five to thirty days apart. This is true of about three out  of four. In others, a long interval, sometimes six months, occurs  between the first and second sickness. If the general health be not _in  the least_ impaired, this need cause no anxiety. Irregularities are  found in the first year or two, which often right themselves afterwards.  But whenever they are associated with the _slightest_ signs of mental or  bodily disorder, they demand instant and intelligent attention.    It used to be supposed that the periods of the monthly sickness were in  some way connected with the phases of the moon. So general is this  belief even yet in France, that a learned Academician not long since  thought it worth while carefully to compare over four thousand  observations, to see whether they did bear any relations to the lunar  phases. It is hardly worth while to add that he found none.    We have known perfectly healthy young women who were ill every sixteen  days, and others in whom a period of thirty-five or thirty-six days  would elapse. The reasons of such differences are not clear. Some  inherited peculiarity of constitution is doubtless at work. Climate is  of primary importance. Travellers in Lapland, and other countries in the  far north, say that the women there are not regulated more frequently  than three or four times a year. Hard labor and a phlegmatic temperament  usually prolong the interval between the periodical illnesses.    An equal diversity prevails in reference to the _length of time_ the  discharge continues. The average of a large number of cases observed in  healthy women, between the ages of fifteen and thirty-five, is four days  and a fraction. In a more general way, we may say from two to six days  is the proper duration. Should it diverge widely from this, then it is  likely some mischief is at work.    In relation to the _amount_ of the discharge, every woman is a law unto  herself. Usually, it is four or five ounces in all. Habits of life are  apt to modify it materially. Here, again, those exposed to prolonged  cold and inured to severe labor escape more easily than their sisters  petted in the lap of luxury. Delicate, feeble, nervous women--those, in  other words, who can least afford the loss of blood--are precisely those  who lose the most. Nature, who is no tender mother, but a stern  step-mother, thus punishes them for disregarding her laws. Soft  couches, indolent ease, highly spiced food; warm rooms, weak  muscles,--these are the infractions of her rules which she revenges with  vigorous, ay, merciless severity.    It is well known, too, that excitement of the emotions, whether of  anger, joy, grief, hatred, or love increases the discharge. Even the  vulgar are aware of this, and, misinterpreting it as half-knowledge  always does, suppose it a sign of stronger animal passions. It bears no  such meaning. But the fact reads us a lesson how important it is to  cultivate a placid mind, free from strong desire or fear, and to hold  all our emotions in the firm leash of reason.    Physicians attach great importance to the _character_ of the discharge.  It should be thin, watery, dark-coloured, and never clot. If it clots,  it is an indication that something is wrong.      THE DANGERS OF PUBERTY.    We have shown that there are constantly individual deviations, quite  consistent with health, from any given standard. They only become  significant of disease when they depart decidedly from the average,  either in the frequency of the illness, its duration, the amount of the  discharge, or the character. More or less pain, more or less prostration  and general disturbances at these epochs, are universal and inevitable.  They are part of the sentence which at the outset He pronounced upon the  woman, when He said unto her, 'I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and  thy conception.' Yet with merciful kindness He has provided means by  which the pain may be greatly lessened, and the sorrow avoided; and  that we may learn and observe these means, their neglect often increases  a hundred-fold the natural suffering.    At this critical period, the seeds of hereditary and constitutional  diseases manifest themselves. They draw fresh malignancy from the new  activity of the system. The first symptoms of tubercular consumption, of  scrofula, of obstinate and disfiguring skin diseases, of hereditary  insanity, of congenital epilepsy, of a hundred terrible maladies, which  from birth have lurked in the child, biding the opportunity of attack,  suddenly spring from their lairs, and hurry her to the grave or the  madhouse. If we ask why so many fair girls of eighteen or twenty are  followed by weeping friends to an early tomb, the answer is, chiefly  from diseases which had their origin at the period of puberty.    It is impossible for us here to rehearse all the minute symptoms, each  almost trifling in itself, which warn the practised physician of the  approach of one of these fearful foes in time to allow him to make a  defence. We can do little more than iterate the warning, that whenever,  at this momentous epoch, any disquieting change appears, be it physical  or mental, let not a day be lost in summoning _skilled_, _competent_  medical advice.    There is, however, a train of symptoms so frequent, so insidious, so  fruitful with agony of mind and body, that we shall mention them  particularly. They illustrate, at once, how all-important is close  observation, and how significant to the wise physician are trifles  seemingly light as air.    If you notice a girl of fourteen or sixteen, who, in walking, always  gives one arm in preference to the other to her companion; if, in  sleeping, she mostly lies on the same side; if, in sitting, she is apt  to prefer a chair with a low back, and throws one arm over its back; if  you perceive that she always sits with one foot a little in advance of  the other; if she, on inquiry, confesses to slight, wandering pains in  one side of her chest,--do not chide her for awkwardness. These are  ominous portents. They mean _spinal disease_, than which a more fearful  malady is hardly known to medicine.    Not less stealthy is the approach of disease of the hip-joint, of white  swelling of the knee, of consumption,--all curable if taken in hand at  the very first, all well-nigh hopeless when they have once unmasked  their real features.    Apart from these general dangers, to which those of thoroughly sound  constitutions are not exposed, there are disorders called functional, to  which all are subject.      GREEN SICKNESS.    When we speak of the 'green sickness,' we mention perhaps the most  common of all, and one of which every mother has heard. Doctors call it  _chlorosis_, which also means _greenness_; for one of its most common  and peculiar symptoms is a pale complexion with a greenish tinge.    It never occurs except at or near the age of puberty, and was long  supposed to be merely an impoverishment of the blood. Now, however, we  have learned that it is a disease of the nervous system, and one very  often confounded by physicians with other complaints.    Its attack is insidious. A distaste for exertion and society, a fitful  appetite, low spirits,--these are all the symptoms noticed at first.  Then, one by one, come palpitation of the heart, an unhealthy  complexion, irregularity, dyspepsia, depraved tastes,--such as a desire  to eat slate-pencil dust, chalk, or clay,--vague pains in body and  limbs, a bad temper; until the girl, after several months, is a peevish,  wretched, troublesome invalid.    Then, if a physician is called in, and gives her iron, and tells her  nothing is the matter, or is himself alarmed, and imagines she has heart  disease or consumption, it is a chance if she does not rapidly sink, out  of mere fright and over-much dosing, into some fatal complaint. Let it  be well understood that chlorosis, though often obstinate and obscure,  is always curable if properly and promptly treated. The remedies must be  addressed to the nervous system, and can be administered with  intelligence only by a competent medical adviser. It can be prevented by  a hygienic mode of life, and, as its most common causes are anxiety,  home-sickness, want of exercise, or overwork at school, nothing is so  salutary in its early stages as a change of air and scene, cheerful  company, a tour to the mountains or some watering-place, and regular  exercise.    Many young women suffer considerable pain during their monthly illness.  This may arise from many different causes, such as, congestion,  inflammation, malformation, or a wrong position of the parts, or  over-sensitive nerves. They can only be successfully treated when "]]]
