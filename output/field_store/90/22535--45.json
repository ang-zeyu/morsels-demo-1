[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21427"],[0,"Comic History of the United States (#7)"],[1,"     The author will now refer to the discovery of the Hudson River and the  town of New York _via_ Fort Lee and the 125th Street Ferry.    New York was afterwards sold for twenty-four dollars,--the whole island.  When I think of this I go into my family gallery, which I also use as a  swear room, and tell those ancestors of mine what I think of them. Where  were they when New York was sold for twenty-four dollars? Were they  having their portraits painted by Landseer, or their deposition taken by  Jeffreys, or having their Little Lord Fauntleroy clothes made?    Do not encourage them to believe that they will escape me in future  years. Some of them died unregenerate, and are now, I am told, in a  country where they may possibly be damned; and I will attend to the  others personally.    Twenty-four dollars for New York! Why, my Croton-water tax on one house  and lot with fifty feet four and one-fourth inches front is fifty-nine  dollars and no questions asked. Why, you can't get a voter for that  now.    Henry--or Hendrik--Hudson was an English navigator, of whose birth and  early history nothing is known definitely, hence his name is never  mentioned in many of the best homes in New York.    In 1607 he made a voyage in search of the Northwest Passage. In one of  his voyages he discovered Cape Cod, and later on the Hudson River.    This was one hundred and seventeen years after Columbus discovered  America; which shows that the discovering business was not pushed as it  should have been by those who had it in charge.    Hudson went up the river as far as Albany, but, finding no one there  whom he knew, he hastened back as far as 209th Street West, and  anchored.    He discovered Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, and made other journeys by  water, though aquatting was then in its infancy. Afterwards his sailors  became mutinous, and set Hendrik and his son, with seven infirm sailors,  afloat.    Ah! Whom have we here? (See next page.)    It is Hendrik Hudson, who discovered the Hudson River.    Here he has just landed at the foot of 209th Street, New York, where he  offered the Indians liquor, but they refused.    How 209th Street has changed!    The artist has been fortunate in getting the expression of the Indians  in the act of refusing. Mr. Hudson's great reputation lies in the fact  that he discovered the river which bears his name; but the thinking mind  will at once regard the discovery of an Indian who does not drink as far  more wonderful.    [Illustration: DISCOVERY OF TEMPERANCE INDIANS.]    Some historians say that this especial delegation was swept away  afterward by a pestilence, whilst others commenting on the incident  maintain that Hudson lied.    It is the only historical question regarding America not fully settled  by this book.    Nothing more was heard of him till he turned up in a thinking part in  \"Rip Van Winkle.\"    Many claims regarding the discovery of various parts of the United  States had been previously made. The Cabots had discovered Labrador, the  Spaniards the southern part of the United States; the Norsemen had  discovered Minneapolis, and Columbus had discovered San Salvador and  gone home to meet a ninety-day note due in Palos for the use of the  Pinta, which he had hired by the hour.    But we are speaking of the discovery of New York.    About this time a solitary horseman might have been seen at West 209th  Street, clothed in a little brief authority, and looking out to the west  as he petulantly spoke in the Tammany dialect, then in the language of  the blank-verse Indian. He began, \"Another day of anxiety has passed,  and yet we have not been discovered! The Great Spirit tells me in the  thunder of the surf and the roaring cataract of the Harlem that within a  week we will be discovered for the first time.\"    As he stands there aboard of his horse, one sees that he is a chief in  every respect and in life's great drama would naturally occupy the  middle of the stage. It was at this moment that Hudson slipped down the  river from Albany past Fort Lee, and, dropping a nickel in the slot at  125th Street, weighed his anchor at that place. As soon as he had landed  and discovered the city, he was approached by the chief, who said, \"We  gates. I am one of the committee to show you our little town. I suppose  you have a power of attorney, of course, for discovering us?\"    \"Yes,\" said Hudson. \"As Columbus used to say when he discovered San  Salvador, 'I do it by the right vested in me by my sovereigns.' 'That  oversizes my pile by a sovereign and a half,' says one of the natives;  and so, if you have not heard it, there is a good thing for one of your  dinner-speeches here.\"    \"Very good,\" said the chief, as they jogged down-town on a swift Sixth  Avenue elevated train towards the wigwams on 14th Street, and going at  the rate of four miles an hour. \"We do not care especially who discovers  us, so long as we hold control of the city organization. How about that,  Hank?\"    \"That will be satisfactory,\" said Mr. Hudson, taking a package of  imported cheese and eating it, so that they could have the car to  themselves.    \"We will take the departments, such as Police, Street-Cleaning, etc.,  etc., etc., while you and Columbus get your pictures on the currency and  have your graves mussed up on anniversaries. We get the two-moment  horses and the country chateaux on the Bronx. Sabe?\"    \"That is, you do not care whose portrait is on the currency,\" said  Hudson, \"so you get the currency.\"    Said the man, \"That is the sense of the meeting.\"    Thus was New York discovered _via_ Albany and Fort Lee, and five minutes  after the two touched glasses, the brim of the schoppin and the  Manhattan cocktail tinkled together, and New York was inaugurated.    Obtaining a gentle and philanthropical gentleman who knew too well the  city by gas-light, they saw the town so thoroughly that nearly every  building in the morning wore a bright red sign which read--      +----------------------+    |   BEWARE OF PAINT.   |    +----------------------+    Regarding the question as to who has the right to claim the priority of  discovery of New York, I unite with one of the ablest historians now  living in stating that I do not know.    Here and there throughout the work of all great historians who are frank  and honest, chapter after chapter of information like this will burst  forth upon the eye of the surprised and delighted reader.    Society at the time of the discovery of the blank-verse Indian of  America was crude. Hudson's arrival, of course, among older citizens  soon called out those who desired his acquaintance, but he noticed that  club life was not what it has since become, especially Indian club life.    [Illustration: CLUB LIFE IN EARLY NEW YORK.]    He found a nation whose regular job was war and whose religion was the  ever-present prayer that they might eat the heart of their enemy plain.    The Indian High School and Young Ladies' Seminary captured by Columbus,  as shown in the pictures of his arrival at home and his presentation to  the royal pair one hundred and seventeen years before this, it is said,  brought a royal flush to the face of King Ferdie, who had been well  brought up.    This can be readily understood when we remember that the Indian wore at  court a court plaster, a parlor-lamp-shade in stormy weather, made of  lawn grass, or a surcingle of front teeth.    They were shown also in all these paintings as graceful and beautiful in  figure; but in those days when the Pocahontas girls went barefooted till  the age of eighty-nine years, chewed tobacco, kept Lent all winter and  then ate a brace of middle-aged men for Easter, the figure must have  been affected by this irregularity of meals.    [Illustration: THE INDIAN GIRL OF STORY.]    [Illustration: THE INDIAN GIRL OF FACT.]    Unless the Pocahontas of the present day has fallen off sadly in her  carriage and beauty, to be saved from death by her, as Smith was, and  feel that she therefore had a claim on him, must have given one nervous  prostration, paresis, and insomnia.    The Indian and the white race never really united or amalgamated outside  of Canada. The Indian has always held aloof from us, and even as late  as Sitting Bull's time that noted cavalry officer said to the author  that the white people who simply came over in the Mayflower could not  marry into his family on that ground. He wanted to know why they _had  to_ come over in the Mayflower.    [Illustration: BILL NYE CONVERSING WITH SITTING BULL.]    \"We were here,\" said the aged warrior, as he stole a bacon-rind which I  used for lubricating my saw, and ate it thoughtfully, \"we were here and  helped Adam 'round up' and brand his animals. We are an old family, and  never did manual labor. We are just as poor and proud and indolent as  those who are of noble blood. We know we are of noble blood because we  have to take sarsaparilla all the time. We claim to come by direct  descent from Job, of whom the inspired writer says,--      \"Old Job he was a fine young lad,        Sing Glory hallelujah.    His heart was good, but his blood was bad,        Sing Glory hallelujah.\"[3]      [Footnote 3: This is a stanza from the works of Dempster Winterbottom  Woodworth, M.D., of Ellsworth, Pierce County, Wisconsin, author of the  \"Diary of Judge Pierce,\" and \"Life and Times of Melancthon  Klingensmith.\" The thanks of the author are also due to Baldy Sowers for  a loaned copy of \"How to Keep up a Pleasing Correspondence without  Conveying Information,\" 8vo, bevelled boards, published by Public  Printer.]          CHAPTER VIII.    THE DUTCH AT NEW AMSTERDAM.      Soon after the discovery of the Hudson, Dutch ships began to visit that  region, to traffic in furs with the Indians. Some huts were erected by  these traders on Manhattan Island in 1613, and a trading-post was  established in 1615. Relics of these times are frequently turned up yet  on Broadway while"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2145"],[0,"Ben-Hur: A tale of the Christ (#7)"],[1,"from the wells, and some leathern bottles. Among the  jars and bottles, rolling upon the stony floor, regardless of the  crowd and cold, often in danger but never hurt, play half a dozen  half-naked children, their brown bodies, jetty eyes, and thick  black hair attesting the blood of Israel. Sometimes, from under  the wimples, the mothers look up, and in the vernacular modestly  bespeak their trade: in the bottles \"honey of grapes,\" in the  jars \"strong drink.\" Their entreaties are usually lost in the  general uproar, and they fare illy against the many competitors:  brawny fellows with bare legs, dirty tunics, and long beards,  going about with bottles lashed to their backs, and shouting  \"Honey of wine! Grapes of En-Gedi!\" When a customer halts one  of them, round comes the bottle, and, upon lifting the thumb  from the nozzle, out into the ready cup gushes the deep-red  blood of the luscious berry.    Scarcely less blatant are the dealers in birds--doves, ducks, and  frequently the singing bulbul, or nightingale, most frequently  pigeons; and buyers, receiving them from the nets, seldom fail  to think of the perilous life of the catchers, bold climbers  of the cliffs; now hanging with hand and foot to the face of  the crag, now swinging in a basket far down the mountain fissure.    Blent with peddlers of jewelry--sharp men cloaked in scarlet  and blue, top-heavy under prodigious white turbans, and fully  conscious of the power there is in the lustre of a ribbon and  the incisive gleam of gold, whether in bracelet or necklace,  or in rings for the finger or the nose--and with peddlers of  household utensils, and with dealers in wearing-apparel, and with  retailers of unguents for anointing the person, and with hucksters  of all articles, fanciful as well as of need, hither and thither,  tugging at halters and ropes, now screaming, now coaxing, toil the  venders of animals--donkeys, horses, calves, sheep, bleating kids,  and awkward camels; animals of every kind except the outlawed swine.  All these are there; not singly, as described, but many times repeated;  not in one place, but everywhere in the market.    Turning from this scene in the lane and court, this glance at  the sellers and their commodities, the reader has need to give  attention, in the next place, to visitors and buyers, for which  the best studies will be found outside the gates, where the  spectacle is quite as varied and animated; indeed, it may be  more so, for there are superadded the effects of tent, booth,  and sook, greater space, larger crowd, more unqualified freedom,  and the glory of the Eastern sunshine.          CHAPTER VII      Let us take our stand by the gate, just out of the edge of the  currents--one flowing in, the other out--and use our eyes and  ears awhile.    In good time! Here come two men of a most noteworthy class.    \"Gods! How cold it is!\" says one of them, a powerful figure in armor;  on his head a brazen helmet, on his body a shining breastplate and  skirts of mail. \"How cold it is! Dost thou remember, my Caius,  that vault in the Comitium at home which the flamens say is the  entrance to the lower world? By Pluto! I could stand there this  morning, long enough at least to get warm again!\"    The party addressed drops the hood of his military cloak, leaving  bare his head and face, and replies, with an ironic smile, \"The  helmets of the legions which conquered Mark Antony were full of  Gallic snow; but thou--ah, my poor friend!--thou hast just come  from Egypt, bringing its summer in thy blood.\"    And with the last word they disappear through the entrance.  Though they had been silent, the armor and the sturdy step  would have published them Roman soldiers.    From the throng a Jew comes next, meager of frame, round-shouldered,  and wearing a coarse brown robe; over his eyes and face, and down  his back, hangs a mat of long, uncombed hair. He is alone. Those who  meet him laugh, if they do not worse; for he is a Nazarite, one of  a despised sect which rejects the books of Moses, devotes itself to  abhorred vows, and goes unshorn while the vows endure.    As we watch his retiring figure, suddenly there is a commotion in  the crowd, a parting quickly to the right and left, with exclamations  sharp and decisive. Then the cause comes--a man, Hebrew in feature  and dress. The mantle of snow-white linen, held to his head by  cords of yellow silk, flows free over his shoulders; his robe  is richly embroidered, a red sash with fringes of gold wraps his  waist several times. His demeanor is calm; he even smiles upon  those who, with such rude haste, make room for him. A leper? No,  he is only a Samaritan. The shrinking crowd, if asked, would say  he is a mongrel--an Assyrian--whose touch of the robe is pollution;  from whom, consequently, an Israelite, though dying, might not  accept life. In fact, the feud is not of blood. When David set  his throne here on Mount Zion, with only Judah to support him,  the ten tribes betook themselves to Shechem, a city much older,  and, at that date, infinitely richer in holy memories. The final  union of the tribes did not settle the dispute thus begun.  The Samaritans clung to their tabernacle on Gerizim, and,  while maintaining its superior sanctity, laughed at the irate  doctors in Jerusalem. Time brought no assuagement of the hate.  Under Herod, conversion to the faith was open to all the world  except the Samaritans; they alone were absolutely and forever  shut out from communion with Jews.    As the Samaritan goes in under the arch of the gate, out come three  men so unlike all whom we have yet seen that they fix our gaze,  whether we will or not. They are of unusual stature and immense  brawn; their eyes are blue, and so fair is their complexion that  the blood shines through the skin like blue pencilling; their hair is  light and short; their heads, small and round, rest squarely upon necks  columnar as the trunks of trees. Woollen tunics, open at the breast,  sleeveless and loosely girt, drape their bodies, leaving bare arms  and legs of such development that they at once suggest the arena;  and when thereto we add their careless, confident, insolent manner,  we cease to wonder that the people give them way, and stop after they  have passed to look at them again. They are gladiators--wrestlers,  runners, boxers, swordsmen; professionals unknown in Judea before  the coming of the Roman; fellows who, what time they are not  in training, may be seen strolling through the king's gardens  or sitting with the guards at the palace gates; or possibly they  are visitors from Caesarea, Sebaste, or Jericho; in which Herod,  more Greek than Jew, and with all a Roman's love of games and  bloody spectacles, has built vast theaters, and now keeps schools  of fighting-men, drawn, as is the custom, from the Gallic provinces  or the Slavic tribes on the Danube.    \"By Bacchus!\" says one of them, drawing his clenched hand to  his shoulder, \"their skulls are not thicker than eggshells.\"    The brutal look which goes with the gesture disgusts us, and we  turn happily to something more pleasant.    Opposite us is a fruit-stand. The proprietor has a bald head,  a long face, and a nose like the beak of a hawk. He sits  upon a carpet spread upon the dust; the wall is at his back;  overhead hangs a scant curtain, around him, within hand's reach  and arranged upon little stools, lie osier boxes full of almonds,  grapes, figs, and pomegranates. To him now comes one at whom we  cannot help looking, though for another reason than that which  fixed our eyes upon the gladiators; he is really beautiful--a  beautiful Greek. Around his temples, holding the waving hair,  is a crown of myrtle, to which still cling the pale flowers and  half ripe berries. His tunic, scarlet in color, is of the softest  woollen fabric; below the girdle of buff leather, which is clasped  in front by a fantastic device of shining gold, the skirt drops to  the knee in folds heavy with embroidery of the same royal metal;  a scarf, also woollen, and of mixed white and yellow, crosses  his throat and falls trailing at his back; his arms and legs,  where exposed, are white as ivory, and of the polish impossible  except by perfect treatment with bath, oil, brushes, and pincers.    The dealer, keeping his seat, bends forward, and throws his hands  up until they meet in front of him, palm downwards and fingers  extended.    \"What hast thou, this morning, O son of Paphos?\" says the young  Greek, looking at the boxes rather than at the Cypriote. \"I am  hungry. What hast thou for breakfast?\"    \"Fruits from the Pedius--genuine--such as the singers of Antioch  take of mornings to restore the waste of their voices,\" the dealer  answers, in a querulous nasal tone.    \"A fig, but not one of thy best, for the singers of Antioch!\" says  the Greek. \"Thou art a worshiper of Aphrodite, and so am I, as the  myrtle I wear proves; therefore I tell thee their voices have the  chill of a Caspian wind. Seest thou this girdle?--a gift of the  mighty Salome--\"    \"The king's sister!\" exclaims the Cypriote, with another salaam.    \"And of royal taste and divine judgment. And why not? She is more  Greek than the king. But--my breakfast! Here is thy money--red  coppers of Cyprus. Give me grapes, and--\"    \"Wilt thou not take the dates also?\"    \"No, I am not an Arab.\"    \"Nor figs?\"    \"That would be to make me a Jew. No, nothing but the grapes.  Never waters mixed so sweetly as the blood of the Greek and  the blood of the grape.\"    The singer in the grimed and seething market, with all his airs  of the court, is a vision not easily shut out of mind by such  as see him; as if for the purpose, however, a person follows  him challenging all our wonder. He comes up the road slowly,  his face towards the ground; at intervals he stops, crosses his  hands upon his breast, lengthens his countenance, and turns his  eyes towards heaven, as if about to break into"]]]
