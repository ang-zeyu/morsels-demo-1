I think it was started by old Jed  Kessler, wasn't it?\"    \"That's the man,\" said Randy.    \"I think I saw those two fellows here in Haven Point,\" continued the  storekeeper. \"They were heavy-set, round-faced men, and each had heavy  black hair and a heavy black beard, just as Kessler described them.  They were here several times. I think they had business at one of the  machine shops, although I'm not certain about that.\"    The Rover boys spoke to several other people of the town and gathered  a little additional information regarding the destruction of the  shell-loading plant, and then reentered their automobile and started  once more for the military academy. With them went Bart White and  Frank Newberry, who had come down to the town directly after the ball  game.    \"It's too bad this affair had to happen just as it did,\" declared Bart  White. \"It kind of takes the shine off of our victory over Hixley  High.\"    \"So it does,\" said Jack. \"But that can't be helped.\"    \"If you put it up to the shell-loading people they would probably have  been willing to postpone the blowing up indefinitely,\" remarked Andy  dryly.    \"I suppose the newspapers here will be full of nothing but this  affair,\" said Fred wistfully; \"and they won't give our game with  Hixley High more than a brief mention.\"    \"Oh, well, what of it?\" cried Randy gaily. \"We walloped 'em, and  that's the main thing.\"    \"Right you are!\" came in a chorus from several of the others.    At one of the street corners, owing to the excitement, there was a  congestion of traffic, and Jack had to bring the car to a stop. As he  did this there was a sudden yell from behind, and then came a slight  bump followed by a jingling of glass.    \"Hi, you! what do you mean by stopping so suddenly?\" yelled an irate  voice from the rear.    \"They've busted one of our headlights!\" added another voice in surly  tones.    Those in the tonneau of the Rovers' automobile looked around quickly.    \"Nappy Martell and Slugger Brown!\" ejaculated Fred in surprise.    \"They must have been following us!\" added Randy quickly.    \"Say, I didn't know those fellows were anywhere around here!\" burst  out Frank Newberry.    \"I thought from what you fellows told us those fellows would steer  clear of this vicinity,\" added Bart White.    By this time Jack and Andy, who were on the front seat, were also  looking back to see what had happened. They beheld a runabout standing  close up to their own car. The collision had not been sufficient to do  any more damage than to break the glass in both of the headlights of  the runabout. They had struck the framework holding an extra shoe on  the rear of the Rovers' car, and for this reason the other automobile  had not suffered any damage whatsoever.    \"You fellows will pay for this damage!\" grumbled Slugger Brown, who  was at the wheel of the runabout.    \"You did it yourself,\" answered Bart White quickly.    \"You fellows had no business to stop so suddenly!\"    \"They did it on purpose!\" burst out Nappy Martell.    As was usual with the youth, he was loudly dressed, wearing a light  checkered suit with a cap to match and a flaming red tie. He looked  somewhat dissipated.    \"I'll attend to this,\" said Jack to his cousins and the others. And  without delay he leaped from the front machine and walked back to the  other.    \"Just see what you've done, Jack Rover!\" began Slugger Brown. But then  the stern look in Jack's face caused him to come to a stop.    \"I'm glad I met you, Brown--and you too, Martell,\" said Jack in a low,  steady voice. \"I was hoping I'd see you before you had a chance to  leave Haven Point.\"    \"Wanted to see us, eh?\" said Slugger; and now a somewhat uneasy look  took possession of his face.    \"Don't let him talk himself out of paying for the damage done,\" put in  Nappy loftily. He was puffing on a cigarette and blew the smoke high  into the air as he spoke.    \"We're not going to pay for any damage done,\" said Jack. \"This little  accident is your own fault, for you had no business to be driving so  close behind our car.\"    \"We'll see about that,\" grumbled Slugger.    \"What I want to talk to you about is another matter,\" went on Jack,  without raising his voice because he did not wish to have any outsider  hear. \"You took the trouble a while ago to stop at Clearwater Hall and  speak to some of the young ladies attending that school.\"    \"Well, what of it? Haven't we got a right to do that if we want to?\"    \"I guess we can speak to our lady friends any time we feel like it,\"  added Nappy.    \"Both of you know very well that none of those young ladies want  anything to do with you,\" continued Jack. \"You've had your warning  before. Now I want you to leave them alone.\"    \"Huh! you talk as if you were our master,\" growled Slugger, an ugly  look coming into his eyes.    \"Never mind how I talk, Brown. You just listen to what I'm saying, and  you mind me. If you don't, you'll get into a whole lot of trouble,  just as sure as you are born.\"    By this time Fred had also left the forward car and was standing  beside Jack.    \"You fellows asked about my sister and about Jack's sister,\" said  Fred. \"Why did you do that?\"    \"That's our business,\" answered Nappy.    \"I know why you did it,\" went on Fred quickly. \"You did it because you  thought you might make some sort of trouble for the girls. I know you!  Jack,\" he continued, turning to his cousin, \"I think the best thing we  can do is to have them both arrested for that affair on Snowshoe  Island.\"    \"You can't bring up those old things--they are past and gone!\" cried  Nappy Martell, his face showing sudden uneasiness. \"Old Barney  Stevenson agreed to let the whole matter drop provided he was allowed  to remain on the island.\"    \"Oh, he's only bluffing, Nappy,\" broke in Slugger. \"They can't do a  thing, and they know it!\"    \"We can and we will unless you leave all the girls at Clearwater Hall  alone,\" declared Jack stoutly. \"Not a one of them wants anything to do  with you.\"    \"How do you know what they want?\"    \"Because they told us.\"    \"I don't believe it, Rover.\"    \"You can suit yourself about that, Brown. But just you remember this:  If you or Martell attempt to do anything in the future to annoy my  relatives or any of our girl friends at that school, I'll see to it  that you are punished, and punished heavily.\"    \"Say, do you know what I think?\" cried Andy, who had come to the rear  of the front car. \"I think we ought to give them both a good licking.\"    \"It might do them both good,\" answered his twin.    \"I don't see how you fellows can show yourselves around here,\"  remarked Frank Newberry. \"After the way you acted at Colby Hall and up  on Snowshoe Island I should think you'd want to keep out of sight.\"    \"What right have you got to butt in here, Frank Newberry?\" cried  Slugger Brown wrathfully.    \"I've got a good deal of right, and you know it, Brown! You and  Martell were a disgrace to Colby Hall, and every cadet at the academy  is aware of that fact. And I, too, know for a fact that none of the  young ladies at Clearwater Hall wants to have anything to do with  you.\"    \"Aw, you fellows make me tired!\" growled Slugger Brown.    By this time a small crowd had collected, anxious to find out how the  damage to the headlights of the runabout was to be settled. Then a  policeman pushed his way forward.    \"Any trouble here?\" he asked.    \"No trouble that I know of,\" answered Jack. \"I stopped my car, and  this fellow came up behind me so suddenly that he smashed his  headlights.\"    \"I see.\" The policeman turned to Slugger Brown. \"Your own fault, was  it?\"    \"It was his fault! He stopped too quickly,\" grumbled Slugger.  \"But--er--I--I--won't make any complaint--at least not--not now,\" he  said lamely. \"I'll take this up later.\"    \"And we'll get what's coming to us--you see if we don't!\" put in Nappy  Martell.    Then Slugger Brown started up the engine of his runabout, backed up a  few feet, and turned out into the roadway. He ran around the nearest  corner and up the road, and was soon out of sight in the distance.          CHAPTER VI    CELEBRATING THE BASEBALL VICTORY      \"He was afraid to make a complaint,\" was Fred's comment.    \"I can't understand why two such fellows should act the way they do,\"  said Bart White. \"They both come from fairly well-to-do families, and  they could be really fine fellows if they wanted to.\"    \"Slugger Brown doesn't come from a very good family--at least as far  as his father is concerned,\" answered Jack. \"Mr. Brown is just as mean  and dishonorable as Slugger. He was at the head of the plot to do poor  Barney Stevenson out of Snowshoe Island.\"    \"Yes, and to my mind Mr. Martell is no better,\" added Randy. \"I've  heard my father talking about him several times. Martell has been in  more than one shady stock transaction down in Wall Street.\"    When the Rover boys arrived at Colby Hall they were immediately  surrounded by a number of their friends, all eager to learn the  particulars of what had occurred in the vicinity of the girls'  boarding school. Of course the others who had come in ahead of them  had already told their stories, but everybody at the military academy  was eager to get all the details possible.    \"It's the worst calamity that ever happened around here,\" said Will  Hendry, the stoutest boy in the school, and who was generally called  Fatty. Hendry had started to leave the school grounds shortly after  the others had gone, but had been stopped by Captain Dale.    \"It looks to me as if it was the work of German sympathizers,\" said  Major Ralph Mason, who was the cadet at the head of the school  battalion. Ralph was the oldest student at the Hall, and one who was  greatly liked by everybody.    \"Ralph, what do you think about our getting into this war in Europe?\"  questioned Randy. During off hours the young officer was always  addressed by the Rovers by his first name, although during"]]]
