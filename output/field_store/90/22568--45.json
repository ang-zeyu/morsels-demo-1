Von Hammer naturally  follows H[=a]jji Khal[=i]fa, and modern writers, like Adm. Jurien de la  Graviere, take the same course. For the period of his life when  Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n was at Constantinople the Turkish writer may be  reasonably preferred; but on all matters concerning the Barbary coast  the Abbot Diego de Haedo, who lived many years in Algiers in the  sixteenth century, was personally acquainted with many of the servants  and followers of Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n (who died in 1546), and published his  _Topographia e historia de Argel_ in 1612, is undoubtedly the best  informed and most trustworthy authority.    [6] Quoted by Morgan, _Hist. of Algiers_, 225.    [7] It is possible that Barba-rossa is but a European corruption of  Baba Ur[=u]j, \"Father Ur[=u]j,\" as his men called him. At all events  Ur[=u]j is the real Barbarossa, though modern writers generally give  the name to his younger brother Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n, who was only called  Barbarossa on account of his kinship to the original.          IV.    THE TAKING OF ALGIERS.    1516-1518.      The new Sultan of J[=i]jil was now called to a much more serious  enterprize than heading his truculent highlanders against a  neighbouring tribe--though it must be admitted that he was always in  his element when fisticuffs were in request. An appeal had come from  Algiers. The Moors there had endured for seven years the embargo of  the Spaniards; they had seen their _fregatas_ rotting before their  eyes, and never dared to mend them; they had viewed many a rich prize  sail by, and never so much as ventured a mile out to sea to look her  over: for there were keen eyes and straight shots in the Penon which  commanded the bay, and King Ferdinand the Catholic held a firm hand  over the tribute which his banished subjects had to pay him for his  condescension in ruining them. Their occupation was gone; they had not  dragged a prize ashore for years; they must rebel or starve. At this  juncture Ferdinand opportunely died (1516), and the Algerine Moors  seized their chance. They stopped the tribute, and called in the aid  of Salim, the neighbouring Arab sheykh, whose clansmen would make the  city safe on the land side. \"But what are they to do with the two  hundred petulant and vexatious Spaniards in the fort, who incessantly  pepper the town with their cannon, and make the houses too hot to hold  them; especially when they are hungry? Little would the gallant Arab  cavalry, with their fine Libyan mares and horses, rich coats-of-mail,  tough targets, well-tempered sabres, and long supple lances, avail  them against the Spanish volleys. And who so proper to redress this  grievance as the invincible Barbarossa, who was master of a naval  force, and wanted not artillery? Had he not been twice to reinstate  the unfortunate King of Buj[=e]ya, and lost a limb in his service?    \"Without the least deliberation Prince Salim despatched a solemn  embassy to J[=i]jil, intreating Barbarossa, in whom he and his people  reposed their entire confidence, to hasten to their assistance. No  message whatever could have been more welcome to the ambitious  Barbarossa than one of this nature. His new-acquired realm brought him  in but a very scanty revenue; nor was he absolute.... He had been  wretchedly baffled at Buj[=e]ya, but hoped for better success at  Algiers, which, likewise, is a place of much greater consequence, and  much more convenient for his purpose, which, as has been said, was to  erect a great monarchy of his own in Barbary.\"[8]    [Illustration: ALGIERS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.    (_Sphere des deux Mondes, 1555._)]    With some six thousand men and sixteen galleots Ur[=u]j set forth by  sea and land to the rescue of Algiers. First he surprised Shersh[=e]l,  a strong position fifteen leagues to the west of Algiers, which had  been occupied by Moors from Granada, and was now commanded by a bold  Turkish Corsair, Kara Hasan, who, emulating his old comrade's success  with the people of J[=i]jil, had induced the Shersh[=e]l rovers to  accept him as their leader. Ur[=u]j had no liking for two Kings of  Brentford, and took off Black Hasan's head as a friendly precaution,  before exposing himself to the perils of another contest with the  Spaniards.    Soon he was at Algiers, hospitably lodged and entertained, he and all  his men, Turks and J[=i]jilis alike, by Sheykh Salim and the people of  the town. There, at the distance of a crossbow-shot, stood the  fortress he had come to reduce, and thither he sent a message offering  a safe conduct to the garrison if they would surrender. The Spanish  captain made reply that \"neither threats nor proffered curtesies  availed aught with men of his kidney,\" and told him to remember  Buj[=e]ya. Upon which Ur[=u]j, more to please his unsuspicious hosts  than with much prospect of success, battered the Penon for twenty days  with his light field-pieces, without making any sensible breach in the  defences.    Meanwhile, the Arabs and Moors who had called him to their aid were  becoming aware of their mistake. Instead of getting rid of their old  enemy the Spaniard, they had imported a second, worse than the first,  and Ur[=u]j soon showed them who was to be master. He and his Turks  treated the ancient Moorish families, who had welcomed them within  their gates, with an insolence that was hard to be borne by  descendants of the Abencerrages and other noble houses of Granada.  Salim, the Arab Sheykh, was the first to feel the despot's power: he  was murdered in his bath--it was said by the Corsair himself. In their  alarm, the Algerines secretly made common cause with the soldiers of  the Penon, and a general rising was planned; but one day at Friday  prayers Barbarossa let the crowded congregation know that their  designs were not unsuspected. Shutting the gates, the Turks bound  their entertainers with the turbans off their heads, and the immediate  decapitation of the ringleaders at the mosque door quelled the spirit  of revolt. Nor was a great Armada, sent by Cardinal Ximenes, and  commanded by Don Diego de Vera, more successful than the Algerine  rebellion. Seven thousand Spaniards were utterly routed by the Turks  and Arabs; and to complete the discomfiture of the Christians a  violent tempest drove their ships ashore, insomuch that this mighty  expedition was all but annihilate.    An adventurer who, with a motley following of untrained bandits and  nomads, could overthrow a Spanish army was a phenomenon which the  Christian States now began to eye with considerable anxiety. From the  possessor of a strong place or two on the coast, he had become nothing  less than the Sultan of Middle Barbary (_Maghrib el-Awsat_). When the  Prince of Tinnis raised the whole country side against him, and a  mighty host was rolling down upon Algiers, Ur[=u]j marched out with  one thousand Turks and five hundred Moors, and never a cannon amongst  them, and smote the enemy hip and thigh, and pursued them into their  own city. The prince of Tinnis took to the mountains, and Ur[=u]j  Barbarossa reigned in his stead (1517). Then Tilims[=a]n fell into his  possession, and save that the Spaniards held Oran and two or three  fortresses, such as the Penon de Alger and Buj[=e]ya, his dominions  coincided with modern Algeria, and marched with the kingdoms of Tunis  and Fez. He was in a position to form alliances with Fez and Morocco.  His galleots were punctilious, moreover, in returning the call of Don  Diego de Vera, and many an expectant merchant in Genoa, or Naples, or  Venice, strained his eyes in vain for the argosy that, thanks to the  Corsair's vigilance, would never again sail proudly into the harbour.    When all this came to the ears of the new King of Spain, afterwards  the Emperor Charles V, he yielded to the prayer of the Marquis de  Comares, Governor of Oran, and despatched ten thousand veterans to  make an end of the Corsairs once and for ever. Ur[=u]j Barbarossa was  then stationed at Tilims[=a]n with only 1,500 men, and when the hosts  of the enemy drew near he made a bolt by night for Algiers, taking his  Turks and his treasure with him. The news soon reached the enemy's  scouts, and the Marquis gave hot pursuit. A river with steep banks lay  in the fugitives' path: could they pass it, they would have the  chances in their favour. Ur[=u]j scattered his jewels and gold behind  him, vainly hoping to delay the greedy Spaniards; but Comares trampled  over everything, and came up with the Turkish rear when but half their  force had crossed the river. Their leader was already safe on the  other side, but the cries of his rear-guard brought him back. The  Corsair was not the man to desert his followers, and without an  instant's hesitation he recrossed the fatal stream and threw himself  into the fray. Hardly a Turk or a Moor escaped from that bloody field.  Facing round, they fought till they dropped; and among them the  vigorous figure of Barbarossa was ever to be seen, laying about him  with his one arm like a lion to the last.    \"Ur[=u]j Barbarossa, according to the testimony of those who remember  him, was, when he died, about forty-four years of age. He was not very  tall of stature, but extremely well set and robust. His hair and beard  perfectly red; his eyes quick, sparkling and lively; his nose aquiline  or Roman; and his complexion between brown and fair. He was a man  excessively bold, resolute, daring, magnanimous, enterprizing,  profusely liberal, and in nowise bloodthirsty, except in the heat of  battle, nor rigorously cruel but when disobeyed He was highly beloved,  feared, and respected, by his soldiers and domestics, and when dead  was by them all in general most bitterly regretted and lamented.

Every morning, as I awoke, I  somehow felt the day coming to me like a new gilt-edged letter, with  some unheard-of news awaiting me on the opening of the envelope. And,  lest I should lose any fragment of it, I would hurry through my toilet  to my chair outside. Every day there was the ebb and flow of the tide on  the Ganges; the various gait of so many different boats; the shifting of  the shadows of the trees from west to east; and, over the fringe of  shade-patches of the woods on the opposite bank, the gush of golden  life-blood through the pierced breast of the evening sky. Some days  would be cloudy from early morning; the opposite woods black; black  shadows moving over the river. Then with a rush would come the  vociferous rain, blotting out the horizon; the dim line of the other  bank taking its leave in tears: the river swelling with suppressed  heavings; and the moist wind making free with the foliage of the trees  overhead.    I felt that out of the bowels of wall, beam and rafter, I had a new  birth into the outside. In making fresh acquaintance with things, the  dingy covering of petty habits seemed to drop off the world. I am sure  that the sugar-cane molasses, which I had with cold _luchis_ for my  breakfast, could not have tasted different from the ambrosia which  _Indra_[15] quaffs in his heaven; for, the immortality is not in the  nectar but in the taster, and thus is missed by those who seek it.    Behind the house was a walled-in enclosure with a tank and a flight of  steps leading into the water from a bathing platform. On one side of the  platform was an immense Jambolan tree, and all round were various fruit  trees, growing in thick clusters, in the shade of which the tank nestled  in its privacy. The veiled beauty of this retired little inner garden  had a wonderful charm for me, so different from the broad expanse of the  river-bank in front. It was like the bride of the house, in the  seclusion of her midday siesta, resting on a many-coloured quilt of her  own embroidering, murmuring low the secrets of her heart. Many a midday  hour did I spend alone under that Jambolan tree dreaming of the fearsome  kingdom of the Yakshas[16] within the depths of the tank.    I had a great curiosity to see a Bengal village. Its clusters of  cottages, its thatched pavilions, its lanes and bathing places, its  games and gatherings, its fields and markets, its life as a whole as I  saw it in imagination, greatly attracted me. Just such a village was  right on the other side of our garden wall, but it was forbidden to us.  We had come out, but not into freedom. We had been in a cage, and were  now on a perch, but the chain was still there.    One morning two of our elders went out for a stroll into the village. I  could not restrain my eagerness any longer, and, slipping out  unperceived, followed them for some distance. As I went along the deeply  shaded lane, with its close thorny _seora_ hedges, by the side of the  tank covered with green water weeds, I rapturously took in picture after  picture. I still remember the man with bare body, engaged in a belated  toilet on the edge of the tank, cleaning his teeth with the chewed end  of a twig. Suddenly my elders became aware of my presence behind them.  \"Get away, get away, go back at once!\" they scolded. They were  scandalised. My feet were bare, I had no scarf or upper-robe over my  tunic, I was not dressed fit to come out; as if it was my fault! I never  owned any socks or superfluous apparel, so not only went back  disappointed for that morning, but had no chance of repairing my  shortcomings and being allowed to come out any other day. However though  the Beyond was thus shut out from behind, in front the Ganges freed me  from all bondage, and my mind, whenever it listed, could embark on the  boats gaily sailing along, and hie away to lands not named in any  geography.    This was forty years ago. Since then I have never set foot again in that  _champak_-shaded villa garden. The same old house and the same old  trees must still be there, but I know it cannot any longer be the  same--for where am I now to get that fresh feeling of wonder which made  it what it was?    We returned to our Jorasanko house in town. And my days were as so many  mouthfuls offered up to be gulped down into the yawning interior of the  Normal School.          (9) _Practising Poetry_      That blue manuscript book was soon filled, like the hive of some insect,  with a network of variously slanting lines and the thick and thin  strokes of letters. The eager pressure of the boy writer soon crumpled  its leaves; and then the edges got frayed, and twisted up claw-like as  if to hold fast the writing within, till at last, down what river  _Baitarani_[17] I know not, its pages were swept away by merciful  oblivion. Anyhow they escaped the pangs of a passage through the  printing press and need fear no birth into this vale of woe.    I cannot claim to have been a passive witness of the spread of my  reputation as a poet. Though Satkari Babu was not a teacher of our class  he was very fond of me. He had written a book on Natural  History--wherein I hope no unkind humorist will try to find a reason for  such fondness. He sent for me one day and asked: \"So you write poetry,  do you?\" I did not conceal the fact. From that time on, he would now and  then ask me to complete a quatrain by adding a couplet of my own to one  given by him.    Gobinda Babu of our school was very dark, and short and fat. He was the  Superintendent. He sat, in his black suit, with his account books, in an  office room on the second storey. We were all afraid of him, for he was  the rod-bearing judge. On one occasion I had escaped from the attentions  of some bullies into his room. The persecutors were five or six older  boys. I had no one to bear witness on my side--except my tears. I won my  case and since then Govinda Babu had a soft corner in his heart for me.    One day he called me into his room during the recess. I went in fear and  trembling but had no sooner stepped before him than he also accosted me  with the question: \"So you write poetry?\" I did not hesitate to make the  admission. He commissioned me to write a poem on some high moral precept  which I do not remember. The amount of condescension and affability  which such a request coming from him implied can only be appreciated by  those who were his pupils. When I finished and handed him the verses  next day, he took me to the highest class and made me stand before the  boys. \"Recite,\" he commanded. And I recited loudly.    The only praiseworthy thing about this moral poem was that it soon got  lost. Its moral effect on that class was far from encouraging--the  sentiment it aroused being not one of regard for its author. Most of  them were certain that it was not my own composition. One said he could  produce the book from which it was copied, but was not pressed to do so;  the process of proving is such a nuisance to those who want to believe.  Finally the number of seekers after poetic fame began to increase  alarmingly; moreover their methods were not those which are recognised  as roads to moral improvement.    Nowadays there is nothing strange in a youngster writing verses. The  glamour of poesy is gone. I remember how the few women who wrote poetry  in those days were looked upon as miraculous creations of the Deity. If  one hears to-day that some young lady does not write poems one feels  sceptical. Poetry now sprouts long before the highest Bengali class is  reached; so that no modern Gobinda Babu would have taken any notice of  the poetic exploit I have recounted.          PART III          (10) _Srikantha Babu_      At this time I was blessed with a hearer the like of whom I shall never  get again. He had so inordinate a capacity for being pleased as to have  utterly disqualified him for the post of critic in any of our monthly  Reviews. The old man was like a perfectly ripe Alfonso mango--not a  trace of acid or coarse fibre in his composition. His tender  clean-shaven face was rounded off by an all-pervading baldness; there  was not the vestige of a tooth to worry the inside of his mouth; and his  big smiling eyes gleamed with a constant delight. When he spoke in his  soft deep voice, his mouth and eyes and hands all spoke likewise. He was  of the old school of Persian culture and knew not a word of English. His  inseparable companions were a hubble-bubble at his left, and a _sitar_  on his lap; and from his throat flowed song unceasing.    Srikantha Babu had no need to wait for a formal introduction, for none  could resist the natural claims of his genial heart. Once he took us to  be photographed with him in some big English photographic studio. There  he so captivated the proprietor with his artless story, in a jumble of  Hindusthani and Bengali, of how he was a poor man, but badly wanted  this particular photograph taken, that the man smilingly allowed him a  reduced rate. Nor did such bargaining sound at all incongruous in that  unbending English establishment, so naive was Srikantha Babu, so  unconscious of any possibility of giving offence. He would sometimes  take me along to a European missionary's house. There, also, with his  playing and singing, his caresses of the missionary's little girl and  his unstinted admiration of the little booted feet of the missionary's  lady, he would enliven the gathering as no one else could have done.  Another behaving so absurdly would have been deemed a bore, but his  transparent simplicity pleased all and drew them to join in his gaiety.    Srikantha Babu was impervious to rudeness or insolence. There was at the  time a singer of some repute retained in our establishment. When the  latter was the worse for liquor he would rail at poor Srikantha Babu's  singing in no very choice terms. This he would bear unflinchingly, with  no"]]]
