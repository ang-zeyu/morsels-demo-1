Within--there are sounds of other years,       Thoughts full of prayer, and solemn harmonies.\"         _The Cathedral._      +The West Front.+    In taking a survey of this noble edifice it is better to commence with  the western front, which, as Mr. Millers observes, on account of its  height and breadth, should be viewed from a competent distance; a good  point of observation may be easily found on the Palace Green. Even in  its present state it must be admired for its impressive though  irregular grandeur, but when the north wing was standing,  corresponding with the south, which remains comparatively  perfect--before the erection of the octagonal story on the Tower, and  the Galilee or portico, which, however beautiful in itself, has no  proper connection with the rest--it must have presented a frontage  exceedingly grand, and inferior to but few others in the kingdom.  Such, we believe, was the original design, but succeeding bishops or  rulers made such alterations and additions as their tastes dictated,  and in the style then prevailing. This may in some measure account for  the alterations of windows and other parts from their original  designs, and the transitions from one style to another, producing  examples partaking of two periods, but not perfect in either.    The stone used in the erection of the Cathedral was brought from  Barnack, near Stamford, and is of a much harder nature than what was  commonly used; it gives proof of great soundness and durability in the  excellent preservation of some of the mouldings. The soft white stone  used for some of the interior decorations is called \"clunch,\" and is  found within a few miles of Ely; it is well adapted for the purposes  to which it is applied, it is easily worked and capable of being  highly finished, but will not bear exposure to the weather. Most of  the pillars with their capitals and bases, as well as many of the  mouldings and ornaments in the Early English portion of the church,  are of Purbeck marble.    The lower portions both of the Tower and wings were built by Bishop  Ridel (1174-1189), and completed as high as the first battlements,  during the episcopate of his successor, Longchamp (1189-1197), who  however, spent none of his money on the fabric; the lower part of this  work is late Norman, but the upper portions show indications of  transition towards the pointed style. The architecture of the Tower is  worthy of attention, as it shews some beautiful specimens of arcading  in bands between rows of windows, all enriched with mouldings of  various kinds; the western face shows three rows of windows, the  others but two, as the lower one would have been hidden by the roof of  the nave and of the wing on each side, these last being originally of  a higher pitch than the remaining one now is. The upper band consists  of circular openings with quatrefoils in the centre, and above that is  a corbel-table. A spire of timber covered with lead was erected on the  Tower about the middle of the thirteenth century, but it was  afterwards removed, and the upper portion of the Tower, in the  Decorated style, was added, and it was again surmounted by a spire.  These additions were found to be injurious, and it became necessary to  strengthen the lower portions of the Tower to support it; nor is it  improbable that the fall of the north-western Transept was in some  degree owing to the great additional weight, or that it was so far  injured as to require removal. The spire was, we believe, finally  removed about the end of the last century.    The octagonal story does not harmonize with the lower portion. There  is a large window with transoms in each of the four principal sides,  the upper portions only being glazed; it is flanked by octagonal  turrets, which rise a little higher than the centre, they are faced  with shallow arcading and connected with the centre portion by small  flying buttresses; in each turret is a winding stair, but only that in  the south-eastern turret is used. In the top of this turret is placed  the clock bell.    The wings of the western Tower formed a second Transept to the church,  and were doubtless perfectly similar; the remaining wing has towers at  the angles; that at the south-west angle is larger than the other,  though they are of equal height, and rise considerably higher than the  wing. Both wing and towers are covered with ranges of arcading one  above another, commencing a few feet from the bottom; the three lowest  tiers are round-headed, the fourth are trefoil-headed, the fifth and  all above are pointed and profusely adorned with mouldings; and the  whole surface is enriched with diaper patterns. The roof was formerly  of a higher pitch, as may be seen by the marks on the Tower.    Some years ago there was a communication by a covered viaduct over the  road, between this Transept and the east wing of the Bishop's Palace,  which enabled him to visit the Cathedral under cover; and the road  over which it passed is still called \"The Gallery.\"    \"Mr. Stewart has pointed out the fact that the Galilee porch is not  parallel to the axis of the Nave, but has a marked inclination to the  north, while the Choir on the other hand (like that of Exeter),  inclines to the south. This doubtless was for a symbolical reason. The  ground plans of churches, by so frequently assuming a cross form,  typify the doctrine of the Atonement--the Choir or Chancel marking the  position of the Saviour's Head, the Transepts His Arms, and the Nave  His Body. By an expansion of this idea the Choir is made to bend  southwards to shew the inclination of the Redeemer's Head upon the  cross; while, as it would seem here the Porch is turned in an opposite  direction to indicate the position of His feet.\"[22]    [Footnote 22: Hewitt's description of Ely Cathedral,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20925"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 1 (#7)"],[1,"Arkansas, past the site of  Little Rock, till at last a river which seems to have been the Washita  was reached. Down this stream de Soto and his decimated force  floated--two hundred and fifty of his men had succumbed to the hardships  and perils of his march--arriving at the junction of the Red with the  Mississippi River on Sunday, April 17, 1542. At this point de Soto  sickened and died, turning over the command to Luis de Moscoso. Burying  their late leader's corpse at night deep in the bosom of the great  river, and constructing themselves boats, the survivors of this  ill-fated expedition, now reduced to three hundred and seventy-two  persons, made the best of their way down the Mississippi to the Gulf,  and along its coast, finally reaching the Spanish town near the mouth of  the Panuco in Mexico.    [Illustration: A Palisaded Indian Town in Alabama.]    [Illustration: Burial of de Soto in the Mississippi at night.]    [1562]    Thus no settlement had as yet been made in Florida by the Spanish. The  first occupation destined to be permanent was brought about through  religious jealousy inspired by the establishment of a French Protestant  (Huguenot) colony in the territory. Ribault, a French captain  commissioned by Charles IX., was put in command of an expedition by that  famous Huguenot, Admiral Coligny, and landed on the coast of Florida, at  the mouth of the St. John's, which he called the River of May. This was  in 1562. The name Carolina, which that section still bears, was given to  a fort at Port Royal, or St. Helena. Ribault returned to France, where  civil war was then raging between the Catholics and the Protestants or  Huguenots. His colony, waiting for promised aid and foolishly making no  attempt to cultivate the soil, soon languished. Dissensions arose, and  an effort was made to return home. Famine having carried off the greater  number, the colony came to an end. In 1564 Coligny sent out Laudonniere,  who built another fort, also named Carolina, on the River of May. Again  misfortunes gathered thickly about the settlers, when Ribault arrived  bringing supplies.    [Illustration: Fort Carolina on the River of May.]    [1565]    [Illustration: Pedro Melendez.]    But Spain claimed this territory, and Pedro Melendez a Spanish soldier,  was in 1565 sent by Philip II. to conquer it from the French, doubly  detested as Protestants. He landed in the harbor and at the mouth of the  river, to both of which he gave the name St. Augustine. Melendez lost no  time in attacking Fort Carolina, which he surprised, putting the  garrison mercilessly to the sword. The destruction of the French colony  was soon after avenged by Dominic de Gourgues, who sailed from France to  punish the enemies of his country. Having accomplished his purpose by  the slaughter of the Spanish garrison he returned home, but the French  Protestants made no further effort to colonize Florida.    Spain claimed the land by right of discovery, but, although maintaining  the feeble settlement at St. Augustine, did next to nothing after this  to explore or civilize this portion of America. The nation that had sent  out Columbus was not destined to be permanently the great power of the  New World. The hap of first landing upon the Antilles, and also the warm  climate and the peaceable nature of the aborigines, led Spain to fix her  settlements in latitudes that were too low for the best health and the  greatest energy. Most of the settlers were of a wretched class,  criminals and adventurers, and they soon mixed largely with the natives.  Spain herself greatly lacked in vigor, partly from national causes,  partly from those obscure general causes which even to this day keep  Latin Europe, in military power and political accomplishments, inferior  to Teutonic or Germanic Europe.    [Illustration: Indians devoured by dogs. From an old print.]    [1570]    Moreover, the Spaniards found their first American conquests too easy,  and the rewards of these too great. This prevented all thought of  developing the country through industry, concentrating expectation  solely upon waiting fortunes, to be had from the natives by the sword or  through forced labor in mines, Their treatment of the aborigines was  nothing short of diabolical. Well has it been said: \"The Spaniards had  sown desolation, havoc, and misery in and around their track. They had  depopulated some of the best peopled of the islands and renewed them  with victims deported from others. They had inflicted upon hundreds of  thousands of the natives all the forms and agonies of fiendish cruelty,  driving them to self-starvation and suicide, as a way of mercy and  release from an utterly wretched existence. They had come to be viewed  by their victims as fiends of hate, malignity, and all dark and cruel  desperation and mercilessness in passion. The hell which they denounced  upon their victims was shorn of its worst terror by the assurance that  these tormentors were not to be there. Las Casas, the noble missionary,  the true soldier of the cross, and the few priests and monks who  sympathized with him, in vain protested against these cruelties.\"    To all these causes we must add the narrow colonial policy of Spain.  Imitating Venice and ancient Carthage instead of Greece, she held her  dependencies under the straitest servitude to herself as conquered  provinces, repressing all political or commercial independence. A  similar restrictive policy, indeed, hampered the colonies of other  nations, but it was nowhere else so irrational or blighting as in  Spanish America.        CHAPTER III.    EXPLORATION AND COLONIZATION BY THE FRENCH AND THE ENGLISH    [1534]    How the French fought for foothold in Florida and were routed by the  Spaniards has just been related. So early as 1504, and possibly much  earlier, before Cabot or Columbus, French sailors were familiar with the  fisheries of Newfoundland. To the Isle of Cape Breton they gave its name  in remembrance of their own Brittany. The attention of the French  Government was thus early directed toward America, and it at length  determined to share in the new discoveries along with the Spanish and  the English.    In 1524 Verrazano, a Florentine navigator, was sent by Francis I. on a  voyage of discovery to the New World. Sighting the shores of America  near the present Wilmington, North Carolina, he explored the coast of  New Jersey, touched land near New York Bay, and anchored a few days in  the harbor of Newport. In this vicinity he came upon an island, which  was probably Block Island. Sailing from here along the coast as far  north as Newfoundland, he named this vast territory New France.    [Illustration: Verrazano, the Florentine Navigator.]    [Illustration: Jacques Cartier. From an old print.]    [1540]    In 1534 Cartier, a noted voyager of St. Malo, coasted along the north of  Newfoundland, passed through the Straits of Belle Isle into the water  now known as St. Lawrence Gulf, and into the mouth of the St. Lawrence  River. Erecting a cross, he took possession of the shores in the name of  the king of France.    In the following year he made a second voyage, going up as far as the  mouth of a small river which the year before he had named St. John's. He  called the waters the Bay of St. Lawrence. Ascending this, he came to a  settlement of the natives near a certain hill, which he called Mont  Royal, now modified into \"Montreal.\" Cartier returned to France in 1536,  only a few of his men having survived the winter.    In 1540 Lord Roberval fitted out a fleet, with Cartier as subordinate.  Cartier sailed at once--his third voyage--Roberval following the next  year. A fort was built near the present site of Quebec. Roberval and  Cartier disagreed and returned to France, leaving the real foundation of  Quebec to be laid by Champlain, much later.    In 1604 De Monts arrived on the coast of Nova Scotia and erected a fort  at the mouth of the St. Croix, New Brunswick. He also made a settlement  on the shore of the present harbor of Annapolis, naming it Port Royal,  and the country around it Acadia. De Monts is famous largely because  under him the Sieur de Champlain, the real father of French colonization  in America, began his illustrious career. He had entered the St.  Lawrence in 1603. In 1608 he founded Quebec, the first permanent colony  of New France. The next year he explored the lake which perpetuates his  name. In 1615 he saw Lake Huron, Le Caron, the Franciscan, preceding him  in this only by a few days. Fired with ardor for discovery, Champlain  joined the Hurons in an attack upon the Iroquois. This led him into what  is now New York State, but whether the Indian camp first attacked by him  was on Onondaga or on Canandaigua Lake is still in debate. These were  but the beginning of Champlain's travels, by which many other Frenchmen,  some as missionaries, some as traders, were inspired to press far out  into the then unknown West. We shall resume the narrative in Chapter VII  of the next period. Champlain died at Quebec in 1635.    Turn back now to Columbus's time. England, destined to dominate the  continent of North America, was also practically the discoverer of the  same. On St. John's day, June 24, 1497, thirteen months and a week  before Columbus saw South America, John Cabot, a Venetian in the service  of King Henry VII., from the deck of the good ship Matthew, of Bristol,  descried land somewhere on the coast either of Labrador or of Nova  Scotia. Cabot, of course, supposed this prima vista of his to belong to  Asia, and expected to reach Cipango next voyage. So late as 1543 Jean  Allefonsce, on reaching New England, took it for the border of Tartary.  Andre Thevet, in 1515, in a pretended voyage to Maine, places Cape  Breton on the west coast of Asia.  This confusion probably explains the  tradition of Norumbega as a great city, and of other populous and  wealthy cities in the newly found land. Men"]]]
