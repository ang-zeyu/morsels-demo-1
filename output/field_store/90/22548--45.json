The quantities employed were 6-1/2 parts of  decorticated castor beans for every 100 parts of oil or fat, and 50 to  60 parts of acetic acid. After stirring until an emulsion is formed, the  mixture is allowed to stand for twenty-four hours, during which  hydrolysis takes place. The temperature is then raised to 70 deg.-80 deg. C.,  which destroys the enzyme, and a 25 per cent. solution of sulphuric  acid, equal in amount to one-fiftieth of the total quantity of fat  originally taken, added to promote separation of the fatty acids. In  this way three layers are formed, the one at the top consisting of the  clear fatty acids, the middle one an emulsion containing portions of the  seeds, fatty acids and glycerine, and the bottom one consisting of the  aqueous glycerine. The intermediate layer is difficult to treat  satisfactorily; it is generally washed twice with water, the washings  being added to glycerine water, and the fatty mixture saponified and the  resultant soap utilised.    The process has been the subject of a considerable amount of  investigation, numerous attempts having been made to actually separate  the active fat-splitting constituent of the seeds, or to obtain it in a  purer and more concentrated form than is furnished by the seeds  themselves. Nicloux (_Comptes Rendus_, 1904, 1112, and _Roy. Soc.  Proc._, 1906, 77 B, 454) has shown that the hydrolytic activity of  castor seeds is due entirely to the cytoplasm, which it is possible to  separate by mechanical means from the aleurone grains and all other  cellular matter. This active substance, which he terms \"lipaseidine,\" is  considered to be not an enzyme, though it acts as such, following the  ordinary laws of enzyme action; its activity is destroyed by contact  with water in the absence of oil. This observer has patented (Eng. Pat.  8,304, 1904) the preparation of an \"extract\" by triturating crushed  castor or other seeds with castor oil, filtering the oily extract, and  subjecting it to centrifugal force. The deposit consists of aleurone and  the active enzymic substance, together with about 80 per cent. of oil,  and one part of it will effect nearly complete hydrolysis of 100 parts  of oil in twenty-four hours. In a subsequent addition to this patent,  the active agent is separated from the aleurone by extraction with  benzene and centrifugal force. By the use of such an extract, the  quantity of albuminoids brought into contact with the fat is reduced to  about 10 per cent. of that in the original seeds, and the middle layer  between the glycerine solution and fatty acids is smaller and can be  saponified directly for the production of curd soap, while the glycerine  solution also is purer.    In a further patent Nicloux (Fr. Pat. 349,213, 1904) states that the use  of an acid medium is unnecessary, and claims that even better results  are obtained by employing a neutral solution of calcium sulphate  containing a small amount of magnesium sulphate, the proportion of salts  not exceeding 0.5 per cent. of the fat, while in yet another patent,  jointly with Urbain (Fr. Pat. 349,942, 1904), it is claimed that the  process is accelerated by the removal of acids from the oil or fat to be  treated, which may be accomplished by either washing first with  acidulated water, then with pure water, or preferably by neutralising  with carbonate of soda and removing the resulting soap.    Lombard (Fr. Pat. 350,179, 1904) claims that acids act as stimulating  agents in the enzymic hydrolysis of oils, and further that a simple  method of obtaining the active product is to triturate oil cake with its  own weight of water, allow the mixture to undergo spontaneous  proteolytic hydrolysis at 40 deg. C. for eight days, and then filter, the  filtrate obtained being used in place of water in the enzymic process.    Hoyer, who has made a large number of experiments in the attempt to  isolate the lipolytic substance from castor seeds, has obtained a  product of great activity, which he terms \"ferment-oil,\" by extracting  the crushed seeds with a solvent for oils.    The Verein Chem. Werke have extended their original patent (addition  dated 11th December, 1905, to Fr. Pat. 328,101, Oct., 1902), which now  covers the use of vegetable ferments in the presence of water and  manganese sulphate or other metallic salt. It is further stated that  acetic acid may be added at the beginning of the operation, or use may  be made of that formed during the process, though in the latter case  hydrolysis is somewhat slower.    Experiments have been carried out by Lewkowitsch and Macleod (_Journ.  Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1903, 68, and _Proc. Roy. Soc._, 1903, 31) with  ferments derived from animal sources, _viz._, lipase from pig's liver,  and steapsin from the pig or ox pancreas. The former, although it has  been shown by Kastle and Loevenhart (_Amer. Chem. Journ._, 1900, 49) to  readily hydrolyse ethyl butyrate, is found to have very little  fat-splitting power, but with steapsin more favourable results have been  obtained, though the yield of fatty acids in this case is considerably  inferior to that given by castor seeds. With cotton-seed oil, 83-86 per  cent. of fatty acids were liberated as a maximum after fifty-six days,  but with lard only 46 per cent. were produced in the same time. Addition  of dilute acid or alkali appeared to exert no influence on the  decomposition of the cotton-seed oil, but in the case of the lard,  dilute alkali seemed at first to promote hydrolysis, though afterwards  to retard it.    Fokin (_Chem. Rev. Fett. u. Harz. Ind._, 1904, 118-120 _et seq._) has  attempted to utilise the pancreatic juice on a technical scale, but the  process proved too slow and too costly to have any practical use.    _Rancidity._--The hydrolysing power of enzymes throws a good deal of  light on the development of rancidity in oils and fats, which is now  generally regarded as due to the oxidation by air in the presence of  light and moisture of the free fatty acids contained by the oil or fat.  It has long been known that whilst recently rendered animal fats are  comparatively free from acidity, freshly prepared vegetable oils  invariably contain small quantities of free fatty acid, and there can be  no doubt that this must be attributed to the action of enzymes contained  in the seeds or fruit from which the oils are expressed, hence the  necessity for separating oils and fats from adhering albuminous matters  as quickly as possible.    _Decomposition of Fats by Bacteria._--Though this subject is not of any  practical interest in the preparation of fatty acids for soap-making, it  may be mentioned, in passing, that some bacteria readily hydrolyse fats.  Schriber (_Arch. f. Hyg._, 41, 328-347) has shown that in the presence  of air many bacteria promote hydrolysis, under favourable conditions as  to temperature and access of oxygen, the process going beyond the simple  splitting up into fatty acid and glycerol, carbon dioxide and water  being formed. Under anaerobic conditions, however, only a slight primary  hydrolysis was found to take place, though according to Rideal (_Journ.  Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1903, 69) there is a distinct increase in the amount  of free fatty acids in a sewage after passage through a septic tank.    Experiments have also been made on this subject by Rahn (_Centralb.  Bakteriol_, 1905, 422), who finds that _Penicillium glaucum_ and other  penicillia have considerable action on fats, attacking the glycerol and  lower fatty acids, though not oleic acid. A motile bacillus, producing  a green fluorescent colouring matter, but not identified, had a marked  hydrolytic action and decomposed oleic acid. The name \"lipobacter\" has  been proposed by De Kruyff for bacteria which hydrolyse fats.    III. _Use of Chemical Reagents._--Among the chief accelerators employed  in the hydrolysis of oils are sulphuric acid and Twitchell's reagent  (benzene- or naphthalene-stearosulphonic acid), while experiments have  also been made with hydrochloric acid (_Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1903,  67) with fairly satisfactory results, and the use of sulphurous acid, or  an alkaline bisulphite as catalyst, has been patented in Germany. To  this class belong also the bases, lime, magnesia, zinc oxide, ammonia,  soda and potash, though these latter substances differ from the former  in that they subsequently combine with the fatty acids liberated to form  soaps.    _Sulphuric Acid._--The hydrolysing action of concentrated sulphuric acid  upon oils and fats has been known since the latter part of the  eighteenth century, but was not applied on a practical scale till 1840  when Gwynne patented a process in which sulphuric acid was used to  liberate the fatty acids, the latter being subsequently purified by  steam distillation. By this method, sulpho-compounds of the glyceride  are first formed, which readily emulsify with water, and, on treatment  with steam, liberate fatty acids, the glycerol remaining partly in the  form of glycero-sulphuric acid. The process has been investigated by  Fremy, Geitel, and more recently by Lewkowitsch (_J. Soc. of Arts_,  \"Cantor Lectures,\" 1904, 795 _et seq._), who has conducted a series of  experiments on the hydrolysis of tallow with 4 per cent. of sulphuric  acid of varying strengths, containing from 58 to 90 per cent. sulphuric  acid, H_{2}SO_{4}. Acid of 60 per cent. or less appears to be  practically useless as a hydrolysing agent, while with 70 per cent. acid  only 47.7 per cent. fatty acids were developed after twenty-two hours'  steaming, and with 80 and 85 per cent. acid, the maximum of 89.9 per  cent. of fatty acids was only reached after fourteen and fifteen hours'  steaming respectively. Using 98 per cent. acid, 93 per cent. of fatty  acids were obtained after nine hours' steaming, and after another seven  hours, only 0.6 per cent. more fatty acids were produced. Further  experiments have shown that dilute sulphuric acid has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21728"],[0,"The Dog Crusoe and his Master (#7)"],[1,"dwelling, there to lie down and  sleep, and dream, perchance, of rambles and gambols with his gigantic  friend.        CHAPTER FIVE.    A MISSION OF PEACE--UNEXPECTED JOYS--DICK AND CRUSOE SET OFF FOR THE  LAND OF THE RED-SKINS, AND MEET WITH ADVENTURES BY THE WAY AS A MATTER  OF COURSE--NIGHT IN THE WILD WOODS.    One day the inhabitants of Mustang Valley were thrown into considerable  excitement by the arrival of an officer of the United States army and a  small escort of cavalry.  They went direct to the block-house, which,  since Major Hope's departure, had become the residence of Joe Blunt--  that worthy having, by general consent, been deemed the fittest man in  the settlement to fill the major's place.    Soon it began to be noised abroad that the strangers had been sent by  Government to endeavour to bring about, if possible, a more friendly  state of feeling between the whites and the Indians, by means of  presents, and promises, and fair speeches.    The party remained all night in the block-house, and ere long it was  reported that Joe Blunt had been requested, and had consented, to be the  leader and chief of a party of three men who should visit the  neighbouring tribes of Indians, to the west and north of the valley, as  Government agents.  Joe's knowledge of two or three different Indian  dialects, and his well-known sagacity, rendered him a most fitting  messenger on such an errand.  It was also whispered that Joe was to have  the choosing of his comrades in this mission, and many were the opinions  expressed and guesses made as to who would be chosen.    That same evening Dick Varley was sitting in his mother's kitchen  cleaning his rifle; his mother was preparing supper and talking quietly  about the obstinacy of a particular hen that had taken to laying her  eggs in places where they could not be found; Fan was coiled up in a  corner sound asleep, and Crusoe was sitting at one side of the fire  looking on at things in general.    \"I wonder,\" remarked Mrs Varley, as she spread the table with a pure  white napkin; \"I wonder what the sodgers are doin' wi' Joe Blunt.\"    As often happens when an individual is mentioned, the worthy referred to  opened the door at that moment and stepped into the room.    \"Good-e'en t'ye, dame,\" said the stout hunter, doffing his cap, and  resting his rifle in a corner, while Dick rose and placed a chair for  him.    \"The same to you, Master Blunt,\" answered the widow; \"you've jist comed  in good time for a cut o' venison.\"    \"Thanks, mistress, I s'pose we're beholden to the silver rifle for  that.\"    \"To the hand that aimed it, rather,\" suggested the widow.    \"Nay, then, say raither to the dog that turned it,\" said Dick Varley.  \"But for Crusoe that buck would ha' bin couched in the woods this  night.\"    \"Oh! if it comes to that,\" retorted Joe, \"I'd lay it to the door o' Fan,  for if she'd niver bin born nother would Crusoe.  But it's good an'  tender meat, whativer ways ye got it.  Howsiver, I've other things to  talk about jist now.  Them sodgers that are eatin' buffalo tongues up at  the block-house as if they'd niver ate meat before, and didn't hope to  eat agin for a twelve-month--\"    \"Ay, what o' them?\" interrupted Mrs Varley; \"I've bin wonderin' what  was their errand.\"    \"Of coorse ye wos, Dame Varley; and I've comed here a' purpis to tell  ye.  They want me to go to the Red-skins to make peace between them and  us; and they've brought a lot o' goods to make them presents withal,--  beads, an' knives, an' lookin'-glasses, an vermilion paint, an'  sich-like, jist as much as'll be a light load for one horse--for, ye  see, nothin' can be done wi' the Red-skins without gifts.\"    \"'Tis a blessed mission,\" said the widow, \"I wish it may succeed.  D'ye  think ye'll go?\"    \"Go? ay, that will I.\"    \"I only wish they'd made the offer to me,\" said Dick with a sigh.    \"An' so they do make the offer, lad.  They've gin me leave to choose the  two men I'm to take with me, and I've comed straight to ask _you_.  Ay  or no, for we must up an' away by break o' day to-morrow.\"    Mrs Varley started.  \"So soon?\" she said, with a look of anxiety.    \"Ay; the Pawnees are at the Yellow Creek jist at this time, but I've  heer'd they're 'bout to break up camp an' away west; so we'll need to  use haste.\"    \"May I go, mother?\" asked Dick, with a look of anxiety.    There was evidently a conflict in the widow's breast, but it quickly  ceased.    \"Yes, my boy,\" she said in her own low, quiet voice, \"an' God go with  ye.  I knew the time must come soon, an' I thank Him that your first  visit to the Red-skins will be on an errand o' peace.  `Blessed are the  peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.'\"    Dick grasped his mother's hand and pressed it to his cheek in silence.  At the same moment Crusoe, seeing that the deeper feelings of his master  were touched, and deeming it his duty to sympathise, rose up and thrust  his nose against him.    \"Ah! pup,\" cried the young man hastily, \"you must go too.  Of course  Crusoe goes, Joe Blunt?\"    \"Hum!  I don't know that.  There's no dependin' on a dog to keep his  tongue quiet in times o' danger.\"    \"Believe me,\" exclaimed Dick, flashing with enthusiasm, \"Crusoe's more  trustworthy than I am myself.  If ye can trust the master yer safe to  trust the pup.\"    \"Well, lad, ye may be right.  We'll take him.\"    \"Thanks, Joe.  And who else goes with us?\"    \"I've bin castin' that in my mind for some time, an' I've fixed to take  Henri.  He's not the safest man in the valley, but he's the truest,  that's a fact.  And now, younker, get yer horse an' rifle ready, and  come to the block-house at daybreak to-morrow.  Good luck to ye,  mistress, till we meet agin.\"    Joe Blunt rose, and taking up his rifle,--without which he scarcely ever  moved a foot from his own door,--left the cottage with rapid strides.    \"My son,\" said Mrs Varley, kissing Dick's cheek as he resumed his seat,  \"put this in the little pocket I made for it in your hunting shirt.\"    She handed him a small pocket Bible.    \"Dear mother,\" he said, as he placed the book carefully within the  breast of his coat, \"the Red-skin that takes that from me must take my  scalp first.  But don't fear for me.  You've often said the Lord would  protect me.  So He will, mother, for sure it's an errand o' peace!\"    \"Ay, that's it, that's it,\" murmured the widow in a half-soliloquy.    Dick Varley spent that night in converse with his mother, and next  morning at daybreak he was at the place of meeting mounted on his sturdy  little horse, with the \"silver rifle\" on his shoulder, and Crusoe by his  side.    \"That's right, lad, that's right.  Nothin' like keepin' yer time,\" said  Joe, as he led out a pack-horse from the gate of the block-house, while  his own charger was held ready saddled by a man named Daniel Brand, who  had been appointed to the charge of the block-house in his absence.    \"Where's Henri?--oh! here he comes,\" exclaimed Dick, as the hunter  referred to came thundering up the slope at a charge, on a horse that  resembled its rider in size, and not a little in clumsiness of  appearance.    \"Ah! mes boy.  Him is a goot one to go,\" cried Henri, remarking Dick's  smile as he pulled up.  \"No hoss on de plain can beat dis one,  surement.\"    \"Now then, Henri, lend a hand to fix this pack, we've no time to  palaver.\"    By this time they were joined by several of the soldiers and a few  hunters who had come to see them start.    \"Remember, Joe,\" cried one, \"if you don't come back in three months  we'll all come out in a band to seek you.\"    \"If we don't come back in less than that time, what's left o' us won't  be worth seekin' for,\" said Joe, tightening the girth of his saddle.    \"Put a bit in yer own mouth, Henri,\" cried another, as the Canadian  arranged his steed's bridle; \"ye'll need it more than yer horse when ye  git 'mong the red reptiles.\"    \"Vraiment, if mon mout' needs one bit yours will need one padlock.\"    \"Now, lads, mount!\" cried Joe Blunt as he vaulted into the saddle.    Dick Varley sprang lightly on his horse, and Henri made a rush at his  steed and hurled his huge frame across its back with a violence that  _ought_ to have brought it to the ground; but the tall, raw-boned,  broad-chested roan was accustomed to the eccentricities of its master,  and stood the shock bravely.  Being appointed to lead the pack-horse,  Henri seized its halter; then the three cavaliers shook their reins,  and, waving their hands to their comrades, they sprang into the woods at  full gallop, and laid their course for the \"far west.\"    For some time they galloped side by side in silence, each occupied with  his own thoughts, Crusoe keeping close beside his master's horse.  The  two elder hunters evidently ruminated on the object of their mission and  the prospects of success, for their countenances were grave and their  eyes cast on the ground.  Dick Varley, too, thought upon the Red-men,  but his musings were deeply tinged with the bright hues of a _first_  adventure.  The mountains, the plains, the Indians, the bears, the  buffaloes, and a thousand other objects, danced wildly before his mind's  eye, and his blood careered through his veins and flushed his forehead  as he thought of what he should see and do, and felt the elastic vigour  of youth respond in sympathy to the light spring of his active little  steed.  He was a lover of nature, too, and his flashing eyes glanced  observantly from side to side as they swept along,--sometimes through  glades of forest trees; sometimes through belts of more open ground and  shrubbery; anon by the margin of a stream, or along the shores of a  little lake, and often over short stretches of flowering prairie-land,--  while the firm, elastic turf sent up a muffled sound from the tramp of  their mettlesome chargers.  It was a scene of wild, luxuriant beauty,  that might almost (one could fancy) have drawn involuntary "]]]
