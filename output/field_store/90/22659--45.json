Looking in between the stones, I  found the carcass of the luckless rat, with its head and neck eaten  away. The mink had made a meal of him.          VI    THE SKUNK      In February a new track appears upon the snow, slender and delicate,  about a third larger than that of the gray squirrel, indicating no haste  or speed, but, on the contrary, denoting the most imperturbable ease and  leisure, the footprints so close together that the trail appears like a  chain of curiously carved links. Sir _Mephitis mephitica_, or, in plain  English, the skunk, has waked up from his six weeks' nap, and come out  into society again. He is a nocturnal traveler, very bold and impudent,  coming quite up to the barn and outbuildings, and sometimes taking up  his quarters for the season under the haymow. There is no such word as  hurry in his dictionary, as you may see by his path upon the snow. He  has a very sneaking, insinuating way, and goes creeping about the fields  and woods, never once in a perceptible degree altering his gait, and, if  a fence crosses his course, steers for a break or opening to avoid  climbing. He is too indolent even to dig his own hole, but appropriates  that of a woodchuck, or hunts out a crevice in the rocks, from which he  extends his rambling in all directions, preferring damp, thawy weather.  He has very little discretion or cunning, and holds a trap in utter  contempt, stepping into it as soon as beside it, relying implicitly for  defense against all forms of danger upon the unsavory punishment he is  capable of inflicting. He is quite indifferent to both man and beast,  and will not hurry himself to get out of the way of either. Walking  through the summer fields at twilight, I have come near stepping upon  him, and was much the more disturbed of the two.    He has a secret to keep and knows it, and is careful not to betray  himself until he can do so with the most telling effect. I have known  him to preserve his serenity even when caught in a steel trap, and look  the very picture of injured innocence, manoeuvring carefully and  deliberately to extricate his foot from the grasp of the naughty jaws.  Do not by any means take pity on him, and lend a helping hand!    How pretty his face and head! How fine and delicate his teeth, like a  weasel's or a cat's! When about a third grown, he looks so well that one  covets him for a pet. My neighbor once captured a young one, which he  kept over a year, and which afforded him much amusement. He named it  Mahomet.    No animal is more cleanly in its habits than he. He is not an awkward  boy who cuts his own face with his whip; and neither his flesh nor his  fur hints the weapon with which he is armed. The most silent creature  known to me, he makes no sound, so far as I have observed, save a  diffuse, impatient noise, like that produced by beating your hand with a  whisk-broom, when the farm-dog has discovered his retreat in the stone  fence. He renders himself obnoxious to the farmer by his partiality for  hens' eggs and young poultry. He is a confirmed epicure, and at  plundering hen-roosts an expert. Not the full-grown fowls are his  victims, but the youngest and most tender. At night Mother Hen receives  under her maternal wings a dozen newly hatched chickens, and with much  pride and satisfaction feels them all safely tucked away in her  feathers. In the morning she is walking about disconsolately, attended  by only two or three of all that pretty brood. What has happened? Where  are they gone? That pickpocket, Sir Mephitis, could solve the mystery.  Quietly has he approached, under cover of darkness, and one by one  relieved her of her precious charge. Look closely, and you will see  their little yellow legs and beaks, or part of a mangled form, lying  about on the ground. Or, before the hen has hatched, he may find her  out, and, by the same sleight of hand, remove every egg, leaving only  the empty blood-stained shells to witness against him. The birds,  especially the ground-builders, suffer in like manner from his  plundering propensities.    [Illustration: SKUNK]    The secretion upon which he relies for defense, and which is the chief  source of his unpopularity, while it affords good reasons against  cultivating him as a pet, and mars his attractiveness as game, is by no  means the greatest indignity that can be offered to a nose. It is a  rank, living smell, and has none of the sickening qualities of disease  or putrefaction. Indeed, I think a good smeller will enjoy its most  refined intensity. It approaches the sublime, and makes the nose tingle.  It is tonic and bracing, and, I can readily believe, has rare medicinal  qualities. I do not recommend its use as eye-water, though an old farmer  assures me it has undoubted virtues when thus applied. Hearing, one  night, a disturbance among his hens, he rushed suddenly out to catch the  thief, when Sir Mephitis, taken by surprise, and no doubt much annoyed  at being interrupted, discharged the vials of his wrath full in the  farmer's face, and with such admirable effect that, for a few moments,  he was completely blinded, and powerless to revenge himself upon the  rogue, who embraced the opportunity to make good his escape; but he  declared that afterwards his eyes felt as if purged by fire, and his  sight was much clearer.    The skunk has perfect confidence in the efficacy of his weapon. Late one  March afternoon in my walk, I saw one coming down through a field toward  the highway. I thought I would intercept him and turn him back. I  advanced to within fifteen or twenty yards of him, and, as he did not  check his course, judged it prudent to check mine. On he came toward me,  with the most jaunty and frolicsome air, waving his tail high above his  head and challenging me to the combat. I retreated and he pursued, till  I finally left him master of the field.          VII    THE FOX      It has been many a long day since I heard a fox bark, but in my youth  among the Catskills I often heard the sound, especially of a still  moonlight night in midwinter. Perhaps it was more a cry than a bark, not  continuous like the baying of a dog, but uttered at intervals. One feels  that the creature is trying to bark, but has not yet learned the trick  of it. But it is a wild, weird sound. I would get up any night to hear  it again. I used to listen for it when a boy, standing in front of my  father's house. Presently I would hear one away up on the shoulder of  the mountain, and I imagined I could almost see him sitting there in his  furs upon the illuminated surface and looking down in my direction. As I  listened, maybe one would answer him from behind the woods in the  valley, a fitting sound amid the ghostly winter hills.    The red fox was the only species that abounded in this locality. On my  way to school in the morning, after a fresh fall of snow, I would see  at many points where he had crossed the road. Here he had leisurely  passed within rifle-range of the house, evidently reconnoitring the  premises with an eye to the hen-roost. That clear, sharp track,--there  was no mistaking it for the clumsy footprint of a little dog. All his  wildness and agility were photographed in it. Here he had taken fright,  or suddenly recollected an engagement, and in long, graceful leaps,  barely touching the fence, had gone careering up the hill as fleet as  the wind.    The usual gait of the fox, unlike that of the dog, is, at night at  least, a walk. On such occasions he is in quest of game and he goes  through the woods and fields in an alert, stealthy manner, stepping  about a foot at a time, and keeping his eyes and ears open.    The wild, buoyant creature, how beautiful he is! I had often seen his  dead carcass, and at a distance had witnessed the hounds drive him  across the upper fields; but the thrill and excitement of meeting him in  his wild freedom in the woods were unknown to me till, one cold winter  day, drawn thither by the baying of a hound, I stood near the summit of  the mountain, waiting a renewal of the sound, that I might determine the  course of the dog and choose my position,--stimulated by the ambition of  all young Nimrods to bag some notable game. Long I waited, and  patiently, till, chilled and benumbed, I was about to turn back, when,  hearing a slight noise, I looked up and beheld a most superb fox, loping  along with inimitable grace and ease, evidently disturbed, but not  pursued by the hound, and so absorbed in his private meditations that he  failed to see me, though I stood transfixed with amazement and  admiration, not ten yards distant. I took his measure at a glance,--a  large male, with dark legs, and massive tail tipped with white,--a most  magnificent creature; but so astonished and fascinated was I by this  sudden appearance and matchless beauty, that not till I had caught the  last glimpse of him, as he disappeared over a knoll, did I awake to my  duty as a sportsman, and realize what an opportunity to distinguish  myself I had unconsciously let slip. I clutched my gun, half angrily, as  if it was to blame, and went home out of humor with myself and all  fox-kind. But I have since thought better of the experience, and  concluded that I bagged the game after all, the best part of it, and  fleeced Reynard of something more valuable than his fur, without his  knowledge.    This is thoroughly a winter sound,--this voice of the hound upon the  mountain,--and one that is music to many ears. The long trumpet-like  bay, heard for a mile or more,--now faintly back to the deep recesses of  the mountain,--now distinct, but still faint, as the hound comes over  some prominent point and the wind favors,--anon entirely lost in the  gully,--then breaking out again much nearer, and growing more and more  pronounced as the dog approaches, till, when he comes around the brow of  the"]]]
