History has preserved the names of some of these Teutonic  _deities_. Veleda, by prophetic inspiration, or by superior genius,  directed the councils of her nation, and for some years  successfully resisted the progress of the imperial arms.[30]  Momentous questions of state or religion were submitted to their  _divine_ judgment, and it is not wonderful if, endowed with  supernatural attributes, they, like other prophets, helped to  fulfil their own predictions. The Britons and Gauls, of the Keltic  race, seem to have resembled the Orientals, rather than the Teutons  or Italians, in their religious systems. Long before the Romans came  in contact with them the magic science is said to have been  developed, and the priests, like those of India or Egypt,  communicated the mysteries only to a privileged few, with  circumstances of profound secrecy. Such was the excellence of the  magic science of the British Druids, that Pliny (_Hist. Nat._  xxx.) was induced to suppose that the Magi of Persia must have  derived their system from Britain. For the most part the Kelts  then, as in the present day, were peculiarly tenacious of a creed  which it was the interest of a priestly caste to preserve. On the  other hand, the looser religion of the Teuton nations, of the  Scandinavians and Germans, could not find much difficulty in  accepting the particular conceptions of the Southern conquerors;  and the sorceric mythology of the Northern barbarians readily  recognised the power of an Erichtho to control the operations of  nature, to prevent or confound the course of the elements,  interrupt the influence of the sun, avert or induce tempests, to  affect the passions of the soul, to fascinate or charm a cruel  mistress, &c., with all the usual necromantic rites. But if they  could acknowledge the characteristics of the Italian Striga,  those nations at the same time retained a proper respect for the  venerated Saga--the German Hexe.      [30] Aurinia was the Latin name of another of these    venerable sagae. Tacitus, _Histor._ iv. 61, and _Germania_,    viii.    Of all the historic peoples of ancient Europe, the Scandinavians  were perhaps most imbued with a persuasion of the efficacy of  magic; a fact which their home and their habits sufficiently  explain. In the Eddas, Odin, the leader of the immigration in the  first century, and the great national lawgiver, is represented as  well versed in the knowledge of that preternatural art; and the  heroes of the Scandinavian legends of the tenth or twelfth  century are especially ambitious of initiation. The Scalds,  like the Brahmins or Druids, were possessed of tremendous  secrets; their _runic_ characters were all powerful charms,  whether against enemies, the injurious effects of an evil eye,  or to soften the resentment of a lover.[31] The Northmen, with  the exception of some nations of Central Europe, like the  Lithuanians, who were not christianised until the thirteenth or  fourteenth century, from their roving habits as well perhaps as  from their remoteness, were among the last peoples of Europe to  abandon their old creed. Urged by poverty and the hopes of  plunder, the pirates of the Baltic long continued to be the  terror of the European coasts; but, without a political status,  they were the common outlaws of Christendom. They were the relics  of a savage life now giving way in Europe to the somewhat more  civilised forms of society, continuing their indiscriminate  depredations with impunity only because of the want of union and  organisation among their neighbours. But they were in a  transitional state: the coasts and countries they had formerly  been content to ravage, they were beginning to find it their  interest to colonise and cultivate. In the new interests and  pursuits of civilisation and commerce, a natural disgust might  have been experienced for the savage traditions of a religion  whose gods and heroes were mostly personifications of war and  rapine, under whose banners they had suffered the hardships, if  they had enjoyed the plunder, of a piratic life. The national  deities from being disregarded, must have come soon to be treated  with undisguised contempt at least by the leaders: while the  common people, serfs, or slaves were still immersed (as much as  in Christian Europe) in a stupid superstition.      [31] The following story exhibits the influence of    witchcraft among the followers of Odin. Towards the end of    the tenth century, the dreaded Jomsburg sea-rovers had set    out on one of their periodical expeditions, and were    devastating with fire and sword the coast of Norway. A    celebrated Norwegian Jarl, Hakon, collected all his forces,    and sailed with a fleet of 150 vessels to encounter the    pirates. Hakon, after trying in vain to break through the    hostile line, retired with his fleet to the coast, and    proceeded to consult a well-known sorceress in whom he had    implicit confidence for any emergency. With some pretended    reluctance the sorceress at length informed him that the    victory could be obtained only by the sacrifice of his son.    Hakon hesitated not to offer up his only son as a    propitiatory sacrifice; after which, returning to his fleet,    and his accustomed post in the front ranks of the battle, he    renewed the engagement. Towards evening the Jomsburg pirates    were overtaken and overwhelmed by a violent storm,    destroying or damaging their ships. They were convinced that    they saw the witch herself seated on the prow of the Jarl's    ships with clouds of missile weapons flying from the tips of    her fingers, each arrow carrying a death-wound. With such of    his followers as had escaped the sorceric encounter, the    pirate-chief made the best of his way from the scene of    destruction, declaring he had made a vow indeed to fight    against men, but not against witches. A narrative not    inconsistent with the reply of a warrior to an inquiry from    the Saint-king Olaf, 'I am neither Christian nor pagan; my    companions and I have no other religion than a just    confidence in our strength, and in the good success which    always attends us in war; and we are of opinion that it is    all that is necessary.'--Mallet's _Northern Antiquities_.    When men's minds are thus universally unsettled and in want--a  want both universal and necessary in states--of some new  divine objects of worship more suited to advanced ideas and  requirements, a system of religion more civilising and rational  than the antiquated one, will be adopted without much difficulty,  especially if it is not too exclusive. Yet the Scandinavians were  unusually tenacious of the forms of their ancestral worship; for  while the Icelanders are said to have received Christianity about  the beginning of the eleventh century, the people of Norway were  not wholly converted until somewhat later. The halls of Valhalla  must have been relinquished with a sigh in exchange for the less  intelligible joys of a tranquil and insensuous paradise. An  ancient Norsk law enjoins that the king and bishop, with all  possible care, make inquiry after those who exercise pagan  practices, employ magic arts, adore the genii of particular  places, of tombs or rivers, who transport themselves by a  diabolical mode of travelling through the air from place to  place. In the extremity of the northern peninsula (amongst  the Laplanders), where the light of science, or indeed of  civilisation, has scarcely yet penetrated, witchcraft remains as  flourishing as in the days of Odin; and the Laplanders at present  are possibly as credulous in this respect as the old Northmen or  the present tribes of Africa and the South Pacific. Before the  introduction of the new religion (it is a curious fact), the  Germans and Scandinavians, as well as the Jews, were acquainted  with the efficacy of the rite of infant baptism. A Norsk  chronicle of the twelfth century, speaking of a Norwegian  nobleman who lived in the reign of Harald Harfraga, relates that  he poured water on the head of his new-born son, and called him  Hakon, after the name of his father. Harald himself had been  baptized in the same way; and it is noted of the infant pagan St.  Olaf that his mother had him baptized as soon as he was born. The  Livonians observed the same ceremony; and a letter sent expressly  by Pope Gregory III. to St. Boniface, the great apostle of the  Germans, directs him how to act in such cases. It is probable,  Mallet conjectures, that all these people might intend by such a  rite to preserve their children from the sorceries and evil  charms which wicked spirits might employ against them at the  instant of their birth. Several nations of Asia and America have  attributed such a power to ablutions of this kind; nor were the  Romans without the custom, though they did not wholly confine it  to new-born infants. A curious magical use of an initiatory and  sacramental rite, ignorantly anticipated, it seems, by the  unilluminated faith of the pagan world.    In reviewing the characteristics of sorcery which prevailed in  the ancient world, it is obvious to compare the superstition as  it existed in the nations of the East and West, of antiquity and  of modern times. These natural or accidental differences are  deducible apparently from the following causes:--(1) The  essential distinction between the demonology of Orientalism--of  Brahminism, Buddhism, Magianism, Judaism, Mohammedanism--and that  of the West, of paganism and of Christianity, founded on their  respective _idealistic_ and _realistic_ tendencies. (2) The  divining or necromantic faculties have been generally regarded in  the East as honourable properties; whereas in the West they have  been degraded into the criminal follies of an infernal compact.  The magical art is a noble cultivated science--a prerogative of  the priestly caste: witchcraft, in its strict sense, was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22829"],[0,"No Animal Food; and Nutrition and Diet; with Vegetable Recipes (#7)"],[1," true carnivora. The gorge of a cat, for  instance, will rise at the smell of a mouse, or a piece of raw flesh,  but not at the aroma of fruit. If a man could take delight in pouncing  upon a bird, tear its still living body apart with his teeth, sucking  the warm blood, one might infer that Nature had provided him with  carnivorous instinct, but the very _thought_ of doing such a thing makes  him shudder. On the other hand, a bunch of luscious grapes makes his  'mouth water,' and even in the absence of hunger he will eat fruit to  gratify taste. A table spread with fruits and nuts and decorated with  flowers is artistic; the same table laden with decaying flesh and blood,  and maybe entrails, is not only inartistic--it is disgusting.    Those who believe in an all-wise Creator can hardly suppose He would  have so made our body as to make it necessary daily to perform acts of  violence that are an outrage to our sympathies, repulsive to our finer  feelings, and brutalising and degrading in every detail. To possess fine  feelings without the means to satisfy them is as bad as to possess  hunger without a stomach. If it be necessary and a part of the Divine  Wisdom that we should degrade ourselves to the level of beasts of prey,  then the humanitarian sentiment and the aesthetic instinct are wrong and  should be displaced by callousness, and the endeavour to cultivate a  feeling of enjoyment in that which to all the organs of sense in a  person of intelligence and religious feeling is ugly and repulsive. But  no normally-minded person can think that this is so. It would be  contrary to all the ethical and aesthetic teachings of every religion,  and antagonistic to the feelings of all who have evolved to the  possession of a conscience and the power to distinguish the beautiful  from the base.    When one accustomed to an omnivorous diet adopts a vegetarian regime, a  steadily growing refinement in taste and smell is experienced. Delicate  and subtle flavours, hitherto unnoticed, especially if the habit of  thorough mastication be practised, soon convince the neophyte that a  vegetarian is by no means denied the pleasure of gustatory enjoyment.  Further, not only are these senses better attuned and refined, but the  mind also undergoes a similar exaltation. Thoreau, the  transcendentalist, wrote: 'I believe that every man who has ever been  earnest to preserve his higher or poetic faculties in the best  condition, has been particularly inclined to abstain from animal food,  and from much food of any kind.'          V    ECONOMICAL CONSIDERATIONS      There is no doubt that the yield of land when utilized for pasturage is  less than what it will produce in the hands of the agriculturist. In a  thickly populated country, such as England, dependent under present  conditions on foreign countries for a large proportion of her food  supply, it is foolish, considering only the political aspects, to employ  the land for raising unnecessary flesh-food, and so be compelled to  apply to foreign markets for the first necessaries of life, when there  is, without doubt, sufficient agricultural land in England to support  the entire population on a vegetable regimen. As just said, a much  larger population can be supported on a given acreage cultivated with  vegetable produce than would be possible were the same land used for  grazing cattle. Lieut. Powell quotes Prof. Francis Newman of University  College, London, as declaring that--         100 acres devoted to sheep-raising will support 42 men: proportion       1.         100 acres devoted to dairy-farming will support 53 men: proportion       1-1/4.         100 acres devoted to wheat will support 250 men: proportion 6.         100 acres devoted to potato will support 683 men: proportion 16.    To produce the same quantity of food yielded by an acre of land  cultivated by the husbandman, three or four acres, or more, would be  required as grazing land to raise cattle for flesh meat.    Another point to note is that agriculture affords employment to a very  much larger number of men than cattle-raising; that is to say, a much  larger number of men are required to raise a given amount of vegetable  food than is required to raise the same amount of flesh food, and so,  were the present common omnivorous customs to give place to  vegetarianism, a very much more numerous peasantry would be required on  the land. This would be physically, economically, morally, better for  the nation. It is obvious that national health would be improved with a  considerably larger proportion of hardy country yeomen. The percentage  of poor and unemployed people in large cities would be reduced, their  labor being required on the soil, where, being in more natural,  salutary, harmonious surroundings the moral element would have better  opportunity for development than when confined in the unhealthy, ugly,  squalid surroundings of a city slum.    It is not generally known that there is often a decided _loss_ of  valuable food-material in feeding animals for food, one authority  stating that it takes nearly 4 lbs. of barley, which is a good wholesome  food, to make 1 lb. of pork, a food that can hardly be considered safe  to eat when we learn that tuberculosis was detected in 6,393 pigs in  Berlin abattoirs in one year.    As to the comparative cost of a vegetarian and omnivorous diet, it is  instructive to learn that it is proverbial in the Western States of  America that a Chinaman can live and support his family in health and  comfort on an allowance which to a meat-eating white man would be  starvation. It is not to be denied that a vegetarian desirous of living  to eat, and having no reason or desire to be economical, could spend  money as extravagantly as a devotee of the flesh-pots having a similar  disposition. But it is significant that the poor of most European  countries are not vegetarians from choice but from necessity. Had they  the means doubtless they would purchase meat, not because of any  instinctive liking for it, but because of that almost universal trait of  human character that causes men to desire to imitate their superiors,  without, in most cases, any due consideration as to whether the supposed  superiors are worthy of the genuflection they get. Were King George or  Kaiser Wilhelm to become vegetarians and advocate the non-flesh diet,  such an occurrence would do far more towards advancing the popularity of  this diet than a thousand lectures from \"mere\" men of science. Carlyle  was not far wrong when he called men \"clothes worshippers.\" The  uneducated and poor imitate the educated and rich, not because they  possess that attitude of mind which owes its existence to a very deep  and subtle emotion and which is expressed in worship and veneration for  power, whether it be power of body, power of rank, power of mind, or  power of wealth. The poor among Western nations are vegetarians because  they cannot afford to buy meat, and this is plain enough proof as to  which dietary is the cheaper.    Perhaps a few straightforward facts on this point may prove interesting.  An ordinary man, weighing 140 lbs. to 170 lbs., under ordinary  conditions, at moderately active work, as an engineer, carpenter, etc.,  could live in comfort and maintain good health on a dietary providing  daily 1 lb. bread (600 to 700 grs. protein); 8 ozs. potatoes (70 grs.  protein); 3 ozs. rice, or barley, or macaroni, or maize meal, etc. (100  grs. protein); 4 ozs. dates, or figs, or prunes, or bananas, etc., and 2  ozs. shelled nuts (130 grs. protein); the cost of which need not exceed  10c. to 15c. per day; or in the case of one leading a more sedentary  life, such as clerical work, these would be slightly reduced and the  cost reduced to 8c. to 12c. per day. For one shilling per day, luxuries,  such as nut butter, sweet-stuffs, and a variety of fruits and vegetables  could be added. It is hardly necessary to point out that the housewife  would be 'hard put to' to make ends meet 'living well' on the ordinary  diet at 25c. per head per day. The writer, weighing 140 lbs., who lives  a moderately active life, enjoys good health, and whose tastes are  simple, finds the cost of a cereal diet comes to 50c. to 75c. per week.    The political economist and reformer finds on investigation, that the  adoption of vegetarianism would be a solution of many of the complex and  baffling questions connected with the material prosperity of the nation.  Here is a remedy for unemployment, drink, slums, disease, and many forms  of vice; a remedy that is within the reach of everyone, and that costs  only the relinquishing of a foolish prejudice and the adoption of a  natural mode of living plus the effort to overcome a vicious habit and  the denial of pleasure derived from the gratification of corrupted  appetite. Nature will soon create a dislike for that which once was a  pleasure, and in compensation will confer a wholesome and beneficent  enjoyment in the partaking of pure and salutary foods. Whether or no the  meat-eating nations will awake to these facts in time to save themselves  from ruin and extinction remains to be seen. Meat-eating has grown side  by side with disease in England during the past seventy years, but there  are now, fortunately, some signs of abatement. The doctors, owing  perhaps to some prescience in the air, some psychical foreboding, are  recommending that less meat be eaten. But whatever the future has in  store, there is nothing more certain than this--that in the adoption of  the vegetable regimen is to be found, if not a complete panacea, at  least a partial remedy, for the political and social ills that our  nation at the present time is afflicted with, and that those of us who  would be true patriots are in duty bound to practise and preach  vegetarianism wheresoever and whensoever we can.
