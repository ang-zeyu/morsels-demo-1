A frontlet of gold and pearls was bound about her  rich red hair, and her robes, of green samite, fell about her as if  they were reeds of the shore.    'What lady is that?' said the king.    'It is the Lady of the Lake,' said Merlin, 'and she comes to you. Now,  therefore, speak fair to her, and ask that she will give you that  sword.'    Then the barge rasped among the reeds where Arthur sat on his horse,  and the lady said:    'Greeting to you, O king!'    'Greeting, fair damsel!' replied Arthur. 'What sword is that which the  arm holdeth above the water? I would it were mine, for I have none.'    'Sir king,' said the lady, 'that sword is mine; but if ye will give me  a gift when I ask it of you, and will swear an oath to give me back the  sword when ye shall be dying, then shall ye have it.'    'By my faith, I will give ye the gift when ye shall desire, and when I  am dying I will truly give back the sword.'    'Then do you step into this barge and row yourself unto the hand and  take from it the sword. And know ye that the name of that sword is  Excalibur, and while you keep the scabbard by your side, ye shall lose  no blood, be ye never so sore wounded.'    So King Arthur and Merlin alighted, tied their horses to two stunted  trees, and went into the barge. The king turned to look to where the  tall green lady had stood but a moment before, and marvelled to see  that she had vanished.    When they came to the sword which the hand held, King Arthur saw that  the water where the hand rose forth was all troubled, and he could see  naught. He took the sword by the handle, and the great fingers of the  hand opened and then sank. So they came afterwards to the land, and  rode on their way to Camelot, and reached it after many days.    When King Arthur entered his hall, and had been welcomed by his  knights, the seneschal brought forth a messenger, who had come from  King Rience of North Wales, and the man with insolent looks uttered  this message:    'My lord, King Rience, hath but now discomfited and overwhelmed seven  kings, and each hath done him homage, and given him for a sign of their  subjection their beard clean cut from their chins. And my lord hath  caused a rich mantle to be hemmed with these kings' beards, and there  yet lacketh one place. Wherefore my lord hath sent me to demand that ye  give him homage and send him thy beard also. Or else he will enter thy  lands, and burn and slay and lay waste, and will not cease until he  hath thy head as well as thy beard.'    'Now this is the most shameful message that any man sent to a king!'  said Arthur, 'and thy king shall rue his villainous words.' Then he  laughed a little grimly. 'Thou seest, fellow, that my beard is full  young yet to make a hem. So take this message back to thy master. If he  will have it, he must wait until I grow older; but yet he shall not  wait long before he sees me, and then shall he lose his head, by the  faith of my body, unless he do homage to me.'    So the messenger departed, and King Arthur set about the ordering of  his army to invade the land of Rience.    Later, on a day when the king sat in council with his barons and  knights, there came a damsel into the hall, richly beseen and of a fair  countenance. She knelt at the feet of the king, and said humbly:    'O king, I crave a boon of ye, and by your promise ye shall grant it  me.'    'Who are ye, damsel?' asked the king.    'My lord, my lady mother hath sent me, and she is the Lady of the  Lake.'    'I remember me,' said Arthur, 'and thou shalt have thy boon.'    Whereat the damsel rose and let her mantle fall, that was richly  furred, and then they saw that she was girded about the waist with a  great sword.    Marvelling, the king asked, 'Damsel, for what cause are ye girded with  that sword?'    'My lord,' said the damsel, in distress and sadness, 'this sword that I  am girded withal, doth me great sorrow and remembrance. For it was the  sword of him I loved most tenderly in all the world, and he hath been  slain by falsest treachery by a foul knight, Sir Garlon, and nevermore  shall I be joyful. But I would that my dear love be avenged by his own  good sword, which my lady mother hath endowed with great enchantment.  And the knight of thine that shall draw this sword shall be he who  shall avenge my dead love. But he must be a clean knight, a good man of  his hands and of his deeds, and without guile or treachery. If I may  find such a knight, he shall deliver me of this sword, out of the  scabbard, and with it do vengeance for me.'    'This is a great marvel,' said King Arthur, 'and while I presume not to  be such a knight as thou sayest, yet for ensample to my knights will I  essay to draw the sword.'    Therewith the king took the scabbard and drew at the sword with all his  strength, but in no wise could he make it come forth.    'Sir,' said the damsel, 'ye need not draw half so hard, for lightly  shall it come into the hands of him who shall draw it.'    Then the king bade all his knights to attempt this feat, and all tried  their best, but it was of no avail.    'Alas!' said the damsel in great sadness. 'And shall my dear love go  unavenged, because there is no knight here who shall achieve this  sword?'    She turned away through the crowd of knights who stood abashed about  her, and went towards the door.    It happened that there was a poor knight in the court of King Arthur,  who had been a prisoner for a year and a day, by reason of his having  slain a kinsman of the king's. His name was Sir Balin the Hardy, and he  was a good man of his hands, though needy. He had been but lately  released from durance, and was standing privily in the hall and saw the  adventure of the damsel with the sword. Whereat his heart rose, both to  do the deed for the sorrowing maid and because of her beauty and  sadness. Yet, being poor and meanly arrayed, he pushed not forward in  the press.    But as the damsel went towards the door, she passed him, and he said:    'Damsel, I pray you of your courtesy to suffer me as well to essay as  these knights, for though I be poorly clothed, my heart seemeth fully  assured that I may draw the sword, and thy sorrow moveth me.'    The damsel lifted her large sad eyes to him, and she saw he was goodly  of form and noble of look, and her heart was stirred.    'Though ye be poor, worthiness and manhood are not in a man's rich  raiment, and therefore,' she said with a sorrowful smile, 'do you essay  the sword also, good knight, and God speed you.'    Balin took the sword by the scabbard, and drew it out easily, and when  he looked upon the sword it pleased him well.    Then had the king and barons great marvel, but some of the knights had  great spite against Balin.    'Truly,' said the damsel, 'this is a passing good knight, and the best  man of ye all, and many marvels shall he achieve. But now, gentle and  courteous knight,' she said, 'give me the sword again.'    'Nay, this sword will I keep,' said Balin.    'Ye are not wise,' said the maiden sorrowfully. 'My lady mother sent  the sword to find which was the knight the most worthy to rid the world  of an evil knight that doeth his foul treacheries and murders by  wizardry, but if ye keep the sword it shall work great bane on you and  on one you love most in this world.'    'I shall take the adventure God shall ordain for me,' said Balin, 'be  it good or ill.'    The damsel looked sadly into his eyes and wept.    'I am passing heavy for your sake,' she said. 'I repent that I have  brought this to you, for I see you lying wounded unto death, and I  shall not be near to comfort you.'    With that the damsel departed in great sorrow.    Anon Balin sent for his horse and armour, and took his leave of King  Arthur, who was almost wroth that he should depart upon a quest that  promised but misfortune. He would have him stay with him in his court,  but Balin would not, and so departed.    For many days, by lonely ways and through forest drives, Sir Balin  fared, seeking for the felon knight Sir Garlon, but nowhere could he  get word of him. At length one night, as he made his way to a hermitage  by the edge of a thick wood, he saw the arms of his younger brother,  Sir Balan, hung upon a thorn before the holy man's door. Just then Sir  Balan came out and saw him, and when he looked on Balin's shield, which  had two crossed swords, he recognised his brother's device, and ran to  him, and they met and kissed each other, and that night they were happy  together, for it had been long since that they had parted; and each  told the other his adventures.    'It seemeth, then, that this King Arthur is a right worshipful lord,'  said Balan, when his brother had told him the adventure of the damsel  and the sword, 'but I doubt me he will not withstand King Rience and  his host. Already that king hath come into this land and is harrying  and burning.'    'That were great pity,' said Balin, 'and I would that I could do some  deed to stay the power of Rience, who is evil-minded and of an arrogant  nature. I would put my life in any danger to win the love of the great  Arthur, and to punish King Rience for his shameful message.'    'Let us go then to-morrow,' said Balan, 'and try our prowess. King  Rience lieth at the siege of the castle Terabil, within ten leagues of  this place.'    'I will well,' said Balin, 'and if we slay King Rience, his people will  go astray and King Arthur shall easily make them yield.'    Next morning early they rode away through the gay woods, drenched with  dew, which sparkled where the sunlight lit upon it. Long and lonely was  the way, until towards the evening they met with a poor old man on  foot, ragged, lame, and dirty, and bearing a great burden. It was in a  narrow ride of the forest, and there was but room for one person to  pass, and though the brothers were making great speed, since they  doubted they had lost their way, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],[0,"Shakespearean Playhouses (#7)"],[1," piece of ground       then inclosed with a pale and next adjoining to the       aforesaid barn, and then or late before that in the       occupation of the said Robert Stoughton; together also with       all the ground and soil lying and being between the said       nether rooms last before expressed, and the aforesaid Great       Barn, and the aforesaid pond; that is to say, extending in       length from the aforesaid pond unto a ditch beyond the brick       wall next the aforesaid Fields.

[Footnote 39: The original lease may be found incorporated in Alleyn  _v._ Street, Coram Rege, 1599-1600, printed in full by Wallace, _The  First London Theatre_, pp. 163-80, and again in Alleyn _v._ Burbage,  Queen's Bench, 1602, Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 267-75. The lease, I  think, was in English not Latin, and hence is more correctly given in  the first document; in the second document the scrivener has  translated it into Latin. The lease is also given in part on page  187.]    [Footnote 40: This part of the property was claimed by the Earl of  Rutland, and was being used by him. For a long time it was the subject  of dispute. Ultimately, it seems, the Earl secured the title, as he  had always had the use of the property. This probably explains why  Burbage did not attempt to erect his playhouse there.]    [Footnote 41: The document by error reads \"brick wall\" but the mistake  is obvious, and the second version of the lease does not repeat the  error. This clause merely means that the ditch, not the brick wall,  constituted the western boundary of the property.]    The lease was formally signed on April 13, 1576, and Burbage entered  into the possession of his property. Since the terms of the lease are  important for an understanding of the subsequent history of the  playhouse, I shall set these forth briefly:    First, the lease was to run for twenty-one years from April 13, 1576,  at an annual rental of L14.    Secondly, Burbage was to spend before the expiration of ten years the  sum of L200 in rebuilding and improving the decayed tenements.    Thirdly, in view of this expenditure of L200, Burbage was to have at  the end of the ten years the right to renew the lease at the same  rental of L14 a year for twenty-one years, thus making the lease good  in all for thirty-one years:         And the said Gyles Alleyn and Sara his wife did thereby       covenant with the said James Burbage that they should and       would at any time within the ten years next ensuing at or       upon the lawful request or demand of the said James Burbage       make or cause to be made to the said James Burbage a new       lease or grant like to the same presents for the term of one       and twenty years more, to begin from the date of making the       same lease, yielding therefor the rent reserved in the       former indenture.[42]    [Footnote 42: Quoted from Burbage _v._ Alleyn, Court of Requests,  1600, Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 182. I have stripped the passage of some  of its legal verbiage.]    Fourthly, it was agreed that at any time before the expiration of the  lease, Burbage might take down and carry away to his own use any  building that in the mean time he might have erected on the vacant  ground for the purpose of a playhouse:         And farther, the said Gyles Alleyn and Sara his wife did       covenant and grant to the said James Burbage that it should       and might be lawful to the said James Burbage (in       consideration of the imploying and bestowing the foresaid       two hundred pounds in forme aforesaid) at any time or times       before the end of the said term of one and twenty years, to       have, take down, and carry away to his own proper use for       ever all such buildings and other things as should be       builded, erected, or set up in or upon the gardens and void       grounds by the said James, either for a theatre or playing       place, or for any other lawful use, without any stop, claim,       let, trouble, or interruption of the said Gyles Alleyn and       Sara his wife.[43]    [Footnote 43: Quoted from Burbage _v._ Alleyn, Court of Requests,  1600, Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 182.]    Protected by these specific terms, Burbage proceeded to the erection  of his playhouse. He must have had faith and abundant courage, for he  was a poor man, quite unequal to the large expenditures called for by  his plans. A person who had known him for many years, deposed in 1592  that \"James Burbage was not at the time of the first beginning of the  building of the premises worth above one hundred marks[44] in all his  substance, for he and this deponent were familiarly acquainted long  before that time and ever since.\"[45] We are not surprised to learn,  therefore, that he was \"constrained to borrow diverse sums of money,\"  and that he actually pawned the lease itself to a money-lender.[46]  Even so, without assistance, we are told, he \"should never be able to  build it, for it would cost five times as much as he was worth.\"    [Footnote 44: That is, about L80.]    [Footnote 45: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 134; cf. p. 153.]    [Footnote 46: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 151. Cuthbert Burbage declared  in 1635: \"The Theatre he built with many hundred pounds taken up at  interest.\" (Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 317.)]    Fortunately he had a wealthy brother-in-law, John Brayne,[47] a London  grocer, described as \"worth five hundred pounds at the least, and by  common fame worth a thousand marks.\"[48] In some way Brayne became  interested in the new venture. Like Burbage, he believed that large  profits would flow from such a novel undertaking; and as a result he  readily agreed to share the expense of erecting and maintaining the  building. Years later members of the Brayne faction asserted that  James Burbage \"induced\" his brother-in-law to venture upon the  enterprise by unfairly representing the great profits to ensue;[49]  but the evidence, I think, shows that Brayne eagerly sought the  partnership. Burbage himself asserted in 1588 that Brayne \"practiced  to obtain some interest therein,\" and presumed \"that he might easily  compass the same by reason that he was natural brother\"; and that he  voluntarily offered to \"bear and pay half the charges of the said  building then bestowed and thereafter to be bestowed\" in order \"that  he might have the moiety[50] of the above named Theatre.\"[51] As a  further inducement, so the Burbages asserted, he promised that \"for  that he had no children,\" the moiety at his death should go to the  children of James Burbage, \"whose advancement he then seemed greatly  to tender.\"    [Footnote 47: The name is often spelled \"Braynes.\"]    [Footnote 48: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 109.]    [Footnote 49: See Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 139 _seq._]    [Footnote 50: That is, half-interest.]    [Footnote 51: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 40.]    Whatever caused Brayne to interest himself in the venture, he quickly  became fired with such hopes of great gain that he not only spent upon  the building all the money he could gather or borrow, but sold his  stock of groceries for L146, disposed of his house for L100, even  pawned his clothes, and put his all into the new structure. The spirit  in which he worked to make the venture a success, and the personal  sacrifices that he and his wife made, fully deserve the quotation  here of two legal depositions bearing on the subject:         This deponent, being servant, in Bucklersbury, aforesaid, to       one Robert Kenningham, grocer, in which street the said John       Brayne dwelled also, and of the same trade, he, the said       Brayne, at the time he joined with the said James Burbage in       the aforesaid lease, was reputed among his neighbors to be       worth one thousand pounds at the least, and that after he       had joined with the said Burbage in the matter of the       building of the said Theatre, he began to slack his own       trade, and gave himself to the building thereof, and the       chief care thereof he took upon him, and hired workmen of       all sorts for that purpose, bought timber and all other       things belonging thereunto, and paid all. So as, in this       deponent's conscience, he bestowed thereupon for his owne       part the sum of one thousand marks at the least, in so much       as his affection was given so greatly to the finishing       thereof, in hope of great wealth and profit during their       lease, that at the last he was driven to sell to this       deponent's father his lease of the house wherein he dwelled       for L100, and to this deponent all such wares as he had left       and all that belonged thereunto remaining in the same, for       the sum of L146 and"]]]
