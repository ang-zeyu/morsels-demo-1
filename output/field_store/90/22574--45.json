Why did he put  so prominently in his demand for ransom the fact that he had taken two  thousand pounds from his victim on the spot? It had no faintest tendency  to evoke the ransom. Quite the other way, in fact. Harrogate's friends  would be far likelier to fear for his fate if they thought the thieves  were poor and desperate. Yet the spoliation on the spot was emphasized  and even put first in the demand. Why should Ezza Montano want so  specially to tell all Europe that he had picked the pocket before he  levied the blackmail?\"    \"I cannot imagine,\" said Muscari, rubbing up his black hair for once  with an unaffected gesture. \"You may think you enlighten me, but you are  leading me deeper in the dark. What may be the third objection to the  King of the Thieves?\" \"The third objection,\" said Father Brown, still  in meditation, \"is this bank we are sitting on. Why does our  brigand-courier call this his chief fortress and the Paradise of  Thieves? It is certainly a soft spot to fall on and a sweet spot to look  at. It is also quite true, as he says, that it is invisible from valley  and peak, and is therefore a hiding-place. But it is not a fortress. It  never could be a fortress. I think it would be the worst fortress in the  world. For it is actually commanded from above by the common high-road  across the mountains--the very place where the police would most  probably pass. Why, five shabby short guns held us helpless here about  half an hour ago. The quarter of a company of any kind of soldiers could  have blown us over the precipice. Whatever is the meaning of this odd  little nook of grass and flowers, it is not an entrenched position. It  is something else; it has some other strange sort of importance; some  value that I do not understand. It is more like an accidental theatre or  a natural green-room; it is like the scene for some romantic comedy; it  is like....\"    As the little priest's words lengthened and lost themselves in a dull  and dreamy sincerity, Muscari, whose animal senses were alert and  impatient, heard a new noise in the mountains. Even for him the sound  was as yet very small and faint; but he could have sworn the evening  breeze bore with it something like the pulsation of horses' hoofs and a  distant hallooing.    At the same moment, and long before the vibration had touched the  less-experienced English ears, Montano the brigand ran up the bank above  them and stood in the broken hedge, steadying himself against a tree and  peering down the road. He was a strange figure as he stood there, for he  had assumed a flapped fantastic hat and swinging baldric and cutlass in  his capacity of bandit king, but the bright prosaic tweed of the courier  showed through in patches all over him.    The next moment he turned his olive, sneering face and made a movement  with his hand. The brigands scattered at the signal, not in confusion,  but in what was evidently a kind of guerrilla discipline. Instead of  occupying the road along the ridge, they sprinkled themselves along the  side of it behind the trees and the hedge, as if watching unseen for an  enemy. The noise beyond grew stronger, beginning to shake the mountain  road, and a voice could be clearly heard calling out orders. The  brigands swayed and huddled, cursing and whispering, and the evening  air was full of little metallic noises as they cocked their pistols, or  loosened their knives, or trailed their scabbards over the stones. Then  the noises from both quarters seemed to meet on the road above; branches  broke, horses neighed, men cried out.    \"A rescue!\" cried Muscari, springing to his feet and waving his hat;  \"the gendarmes are on them! Now for freedom and a blow for it! Now to  be rebels against robbers! Come, don't let us leave everything to  the police; that is so dreadfully modern. Fall on the rear of these  ruffians. The gendarmes are rescuing us; come, friends, let us rescue  the gendarmes!\"    And throwing his hat over the trees, he drew his cutlass once more and  began to escalade the slope up to the road. Frank Harrogate jumped up  and ran across to help him, revolver in hand, but was astounded to hear  himself imperatively recalled by the raucous voice of his father, who  seemed to be in great agitation.    \"I won't have it,\" said the banker in a choking voice; \"I command you  not to interfere.\"    \"But, father,\" said Frank very warmly, \"an Italian gentleman has led the  way. You wouldn't have it said that the English hung back.\"    \"It is useless,\" said the older man, who was trembling violently, \"it is  useless. We must submit to our lot.\"    Father Brown looked at the banker; then he put his hand instinctively as  if on his heart, but really on the little bottle of poison; and a great  light came into his face like the light of the revelation of death.    Muscari meanwhile, without waiting for support, had crested the bank  up to the road, and struck the brigand king heavily on the shoulder,  causing him to stagger and swing round. Montano also had his cutlass  unsheathed, and Muscari, without further speech, sent a slash at his  head which he was compelled to catch and parry. But even as the two  short blades crossed and clashed the King of Thieves deliberately  dropped his point and laughed.    \"What's the good, old man?\" he said in spirited Italian slang; \"this  damned farce will soon be over.\"    \"What do you mean, you shuffler?\" panted the fire-eating poet. \"Is your  courage a sham as well as your honesty?\"    \"Everything about me is a sham,\" responded the ex-courier in complete  good humour. \"I am an actor; and if I ever had a private character, I  have forgotten it. I am no more a genuine brigand than I am a genuine  courier. I am only a bundle of masks, and you can't fight a duel  with that.\" And he laughed with boyish pleasure and fell into his old  straddling attitude, with his back to the skirmish up the road.    Darkness was deepening under the mountain walls, and it was not easy to  discern much of the progress of the struggle, save that tall men were  pushing their horses' muzzles through a clinging crowd of brigands,  who seemed more inclined to harass and hustle the invaders than to kill  them. It was more like a town crowd preventing the passage of the police  than anything the poet had ever pictured as the last stand of doomed and  outlawed men of blood. Just as he was rolling his eyes in bewilderment  he felt a touch on his elbow, and found the odd little priest standing  there like a small Noah with a large hat, and requesting the favour of a  word or two.    \"Signor Muscari,\" said the cleric, \"in this queer crisis personalities  may be pardoned. I may tell you without offence of a way in which you  will do more good than by helping the gendarmes, who are bound to break  through in any case. You will permit me the impertinent intimacy, but do  you care about that girl? Care enough to marry her and make her a good  husband, I mean?\"    \"Yes,\" said the poet quite simply.    \"Does she care about you?\"    \"I think so,\" was the equally grave reply.    \"Then go over there and offer yourself,\" said the priest: \"offer her  everything you can; offer her heaven and earth if you've got them. The  time is short.\"    \"Why?\" asked the astonished man of letters.    \"Because,\" said Father Brown, \"her Doom is coming up the road.\"    \"Nothing is coming up the road,\" argued Muscari, \"except the rescue.\"    \"Well, you go over there,\" said his adviser, \"and be ready to rescue her  from the rescue.\"    Almost as he spoke the hedges were broken all along the ridge by a rush  of the escaping brigands. They dived into bushes and thick grass  like defeated men pursued; and the great cocked hats of the mounted  gendarmerie were seen passing along above the broken hedge. Another  order was given; there was a noise of dismounting, and a tall officer  with cocked hat, a grey imperial, and a paper in his hand appeared  in the gap that was the gate of the Paradise of Thieves. There was a  momentary silence, broken in an extraordinary way by the banker, who  cried out in a hoarse and strangled voice: \"Robbed! I've been robbed!\"    \"Why, that was hours ago,\" cried his son in astonishment: \"when you were  robbed of two thousand pounds.\"    \"Not of two thousand pounds,\" said the financier, with an abrupt and  terrible composure, \"only of a small bottle.\"    The policeman with the grey imperial was striding across the green  hollow. Encountering the King of the Thieves in his path, he clapped him  on the shoulder with something between a caress and a buffet and gave  him a push that sent him staggering away. \"You'll get into trouble,  too,\" he said, \"if you play these tricks.\"    Again to Muscari's artistic eye it seemed scarcely like the capture of  a great outlaw at bay. Passing on, the policeman halted before the  Harrogate group and said: \"Samuel Harrogate, I arrest you in the name  of the law for embezzlement of the funds of the Hull and Huddersfield  Bank.\"    The great banker nodded with an odd air of business assent, seemed to  reflect a moment, and before they could interpose took a half turn and  a step that brought him to the edge of the outer mountain wall. Then,  flinging up his hands, he leapt exactly as he leapt out of the coach.  But this time he did not fall into a little meadow just beneath; he fell  a thousand feet below, to become a wreck of bones in the valley.    The anger of the Italian policeman, which he expressed volubly to Father  Brown, was largely mixed with admiration. \"It was like him to escape us  at last,\" he said. \"He was a great brigand if you like.

Volume 1 (#7)"],[1,"  sailors had not undertaken the enterprise for glory alone, and they  plundered the town before taking to their ships again.    This expedition, however, was but an unimportant incident in the naval  annals of the colonies. It was followed quickly by an expedition of  much graver importance.    When Phipps returned after capturing and plundering Port Royal, he  found Boston vastly excited over the preparations for an expedition  against Quebec. The colony was in no condition to undertake the work  of conquest. Prolonged Indian wars had greatly depleted its treasury.  Vainly it appealed to England for aid, but, receiving no  encouragement, sturdily determined to undertake the expedition  unaided. Sailors were pressed from the merchant-shipping. Trained  bands, as the militia of that day was called, drilled in the streets,  and on the common. Subscription papers were being circulated; and  vessel owners were blandly given the choice between voluntarily  loaning their vessels to the colony, or having them peremptorily  seized. In this way a fleet of thirty-two vessels had been collected;  the largest of which was a ship called the \"Six Friends,\" built for  the West India trade, and carrying forty-four guns. This armada was  manned by seamen picked up by a press so vigorous, that Gloucester,  the chief seafaring town of the colony, was robbed of two-thirds of  its men. Hardly had Capt. Phipps, flushed with victory, returned from  his Port Royal expedition, when he was given command of the armada  destined for the capture of Quebec.    Early in August the flotilla set sail from Boston Harbor. The day was  clear and warm, with a light breeze blowing. From his flag-ship Phipps  gave the signal for weighing anchor, and soon the decks of the vessels  thickly strewn about the harbor resounded to the tread of men about  the capstan. Thirty-two vessels of the squadron floated lightly on the  calm waters of the bay; and darting in and out among them were light  craft carrying pleasure-seekers who had come down to witness the  sailing of the fleet, friends and relatives of the sailors who were  there to say farewell, and the civic dignitaries who came to wish the  expedition success. One by one the vessels beat their way down the  bay, and, rounding the dangerous reef at the mouth of the harbor, laid  their course to the northward. It was a motley fleet of vessels. The  \"Six Brothers\" led the way, followed by brigs, schooners, and many  sloop-rigged fishing-smacks. With so ill-assorted a flotilla, it was  impossible to keep any definite sailing order. The first night  scattered the vessels far and wide, and thenceforward the squadron was  not united until it again came to anchor just above the mouth of the  St. Lawrence. It seemed as though the very elements had combined  against the voyagers. Though looking for summer weather, they  encountered the bitter gales of November. Only after they had all  safely entered the St. Lawrence, and were beyond injury from the  storms, did the gales cease. They had suffered all the injury that  tempestuous weather could do them, and they then had to chafe under  the enforced restraints of a calm.    Phipps had rallied his scattered fleet, and had proceeded up the great  river of the North to within three days' sail of Quebec, when the calm  overtook him. On the way up the river he had captured two French  luggers, and learned from his prisoners that Quebec was poorly  fortified, that the cannon on the redoubts were dismounted, and that  hardly two hundred men could be rallied to its defence. Highly elated  at this, the Massachusetts admiral pressed forward. He anticipated  that Quebec, like Port Royal, would surrender without striking a  blow. Visions of high honors, and perhaps even a commission in the  royal navy, floated across his brain. And while thus hurrying forward  his fleet, drilling his men, and building his air-castles, his further  progress was stopped by a dead calm which lasted three weeks.    How fatal to his hopes that calm was, Phipps, perhaps, never knew. The  information he had wrung from his French prisoners was absolutely  correct. Quebec at that time was helpless, and virtually at his mercy.  But, while the Massachusetts armada lay idly floating on the unruffled  bosom of the river, a man was hastening towards Quebec whose timely  arrival meant the salvation of the French citadel.    This man was Frontenac, then governor of the French colony, and one of  the most picturesque figures in American history. A soldier of France;  a polished courtier at the royal court; a hero on the battle-field,  and a favorite in the ball-room; a man poor in pocket, but rich in  influential connections,--Frontenac had come to the New World to seek  that fortune and position which he had in vain sought in the Old. When  the vague rumors of the hostile expedition of the Massachusetts colony  reached his ears, Frontenac was far from Quebec, toiling in the  western part of the colony. Wasting no time, he turned his steps  toward the threatened city. His road lay through an almost trackless  wilderness; his progress was impeded by the pelting rains of the  autumnal storms. But through forest and through rain he rode fiercely;  and at last as he burst from the forest, and saw towering before him  the rocks of Cape Diamond, a cry of joy burst from his lips. On the  broad, still bosom of the St Lawrence Bay floated not a single hostile  sail. The soldier had come in time.    With the governor in the city, all took courage, and the work of  preparation for the coming struggle went forward with a rush. Far and  wide throughout the parishes was spread the news of war, and daily  volunteers came flocking in to the defence. The ramparts were  strengthened, and cannon mounted. Volunteers and regulars drilled side  by side, until the four thousand men in the city were converted into a  well-disciplined body of troops. And all the time the sentinels on the  Saut au Matelot were eagerly watching the river for the first sign of  the English invaders.    It was before dawn, on the morning of Oct. 16, that the people of the  little city, and the soldiery in the tents, were awakened by the alarm  raised by the sentries. All rushed to the brink of the heights, and  peered eagerly out into the darkness. Far down the river could be seen  the twinkling lights of vessels. As the eager watchers strove to count  them, other lights appeared upon the scene, moving to and fro, but  with a steady advance upon Quebec. The gray dawn, breaking in the  east, showed the advancing fleet. Frontenac and his lieutenants  watched the ships of the enemy round the jutting headland of the Point  of Orleans; and, by the time the sun had risen, thirty-four hostile  craft were at anchor in the basin of Quebec.    The progress of the fleet up the river, from the point at which it had  been so long delayed, had been slow, and greatly impeded by the  determined hostility of the settlers along the banks. The sailors at  their work were apt to be startled by the whiz of a bullet; and an  inquiry as to the cause would have probably discovered some crouching  sharp-shooter, his long rifle in his hand, hidden in a clump of bushes  along the shore. Bands of armed men followed the fleet up the stream,  keeping pace with the vessels, and occasionally affording gentle  reminders of their presence in the shape of volleys of rifle-balls  that sung through the crowded decks of the transports, and gave the  sailor lads a hearty disgust for this river fighting. Phipps tried  repeatedly to land shore parties to clear the banks of skirmishers,  and to move on the city by land. As often, however, as he made the  effort, his troops were beaten back by the ambushed sharp-shooters,  and his boats returned to the ships, bringing several dead and  wounded.    While the soldiery on the highlands of Quebec were eagerly examining  the hostile fleet, the invaders were looking with wonder and  admiration at the scene of surpassing beauty spread out before them.  Parkman, the historian and lover of the annals of the French in  America, thus describes it:--    \"When, after his protracted voyage, Phipps sailed into the basin of  Quebec, one of the grandest scenes on the western continent opened  upon his sight. The wide expanse of waters, the lofty promontory  beyond, and the opposing Heights of Levi, the cataract of Montmorenci,  the distant range of the Laurentian Mountains, the warlike rock with  its diadem of walls and towers, the roofs of the Lower Town  clustering on the strand beneath, the Chateau St. Louis perched at the  brink of the cliff, and over it the white banner, spangled with  _fleurs de lis_, flaunting defiance in the clear autumnal air.\"    Little time was spent, however, in admiration of the scene. When the  click of the last chain-cable had ceased, and, with their anchors  reposing at the bottom of the stream, the ships swung around with  their bows to the current, a boat put off from the flag-ship bearing  an officer intrusted with a note from Phipps to the commandant of the  fort. The reception of this officer was highly theatrical. Half way to  the shore he was taken into a French canoe, blindfolded, and taken  ashore. The populace crowded about him as he landed, hooting and  jeering him as he was led through winding, narrow ways, up stairways,  and over obstructions, until at last the bandage was torn from his  eyes, and he found himself in the presence of Frontenac. The French  commander was clad in a brilliant uniform, and surrounded by his  staff, gay in warlike finery. With courtly courtesy he asked the envoy  for his letter, which, proving to be a curt summons to surrender, he  answered forthwith in a stinging speech. The envoy, abashed, asked for  a written answer.    \"No,\" thundered Frontenac, \"I will answer your master only by the  mouths of my cannon, that he may learn that a man like me is not to be  summoned after this"]]]
