Just stay clear?\"    Tommy reached out and caught his arm. \"Okay,\" he said reluctantly, \"I  will. But you be careful,\" he added fiercely. \"You hear me? And if I  don't hear from you in some reasonable time, I'll raise a stink from  here to Vega!\"    Bart broke away and ran. He was afraid, if he didn't, he'd break up  again. He closed the cabin door behind him, trying to calm down so that  the Mentorian steward, coming to strap him in for deceleration, wouldn't  see how upset he was. He was going to need all his nerve.           *       *       *       *       *    He went through another decontamination chamber, and finally moved, with  a line of passengers, out of the yawning airlock, under the strange sun,  into the strange world.    At first sight it was a disappointment. It was a Lhari spaceport that  lay before him, to all appearances identical with the one on Earth:  sloping glass ramps, tall colorless pylons, a skyscraper terminus  crowded with men of all planets. But the sun overhead was brilliant and  clear gold, the shadows sharp and violet on the spaceport floor. Behind  the confines of the spaceport he could see the ridges of tall hills and  unfamiliarly colored trees. He longed to explore them, but he got a grip  on his imagination, surrendering his ticket stub and false papers to the  Lhari and Mentorian interpreter who guarded the ramp.    The Lhari said to the Mentorian, in the Lhari language, \"Keep him for  questioning but don't tell him why.\" Bart felt a cold chill icing his  spine. _This was it._    The Mentorian said briefly, \"We wish to check on the proper antibody  component for Aldebaran natives. There will be a delay of about thirty  minutes. Will you kindly wait in this room here?\"    The room was comfortable, furnished with chairs and a vision-screen with  some colorful story moving on it, small bright figures in capes, curious  beasts racing across an unusual veldt; but Bart paced the floor  restlessly. There were two doors in the room. Through one of them, he  had been admitted; he could see, through the glass door, the silhouette  of the Mentorian outside. The other door was opaque, and marked in large  letters:         DANGER HUMANS MUST NOT PASS WITHOUT SPECIAL LENSES TYPE X.       ORDINARY SPACE LENSES WILL NOT SUFFICE DANGER! LHARI OPENING!       ADJUST X LENSES BEFORE OPENING!    Bart read the sign again. Well, _that_ was no way out, for sure! He had  heard that the Lhari sun was almost 500 times as bright as Earth's. The  Mentorians alone, among humans, could endure Lhari lights--he supposed  the warning was for ordinary spaceport workers.    A sudden, rather desperate plan occurred to Bart. He didn't know how  much light he _could_ tolerate--he'd never been on Mentor--but he _had_  inherited some of his mother's tolerance for light. And blindness would  be better than being burned down with an energon-gun! He went hesitantly  toward the door, and pushed it open.    His eyes exploded into pain; automatically his hands went up to shield  them. Light, light--he had never known such cruelly glowing light. Even  through the lids there was pain and red afterimages; but after a moment,  opening them a slit, he found that he could see, and made out other  doors, glass ramps, pale Lhari figures coming and going. But for the  moment he was alone in the long corridor beyond which he could see the  glass ramps.    Nearby, a door opened into a small office with glass walls; on a peg,  one of the silky metallic cloaks worn by Mentorians doing spaceport work  was hanging. On an impulse, Bart caught it up and flung it around his  shoulders.    It felt cool and soft, and the hood shielded his eyes a little. The ramp  leading down to what he hoped was street level was terribly steep and  there were no steps. Bart eased himself over the top of the ramp and let  go. He whooshed down the slick surface on the flat of his back, feeling  the metal of the cloak heat with the friction, and came to a breathless  jarring stop at the bottom. Whew, what a slide! Three stories, at least!  But there was a door, and outside the door, maybe, safety.    A voice hailed him, in Lhari. \"You, there!\"    Bart could see well now. He made out the form of a Lhari, only a  colorless blob in the intense light.    \"You people know better than to come back here without glasses. Do you  want to be blinded, my friend?\" He actually sounded kind and concerned.  Bart tensed, his heart pounding. Now that he was caught, could he bluff  his way out? He hadn't actually spoken the Lhari language in years,  though his mother had taught it to him when he was young enough to learn  it without a trace of accent.    Well, he must try. \"Margil sent me to check,\" he improvised quickly.  \"They were holding someone for questioning, and he seems to have gotten  away somehow, so I wanted to make sure he didn't come through here.\"    \"What is the matter that one man can give us all the slip this way?\" the  Lhari said curiously. \"Well, one thing is sure, he's Vegan or Solarian  or Capellan, one of the dim-star people. If he comes through here, we'll  catch him easily enough while he's stumbling around half blind. You know  that you shouldn't stay long.\" He gestured. \"Out this way--and don't  come back without special lenses.\"    Bart nodded, jerking the cloak around his shoulders, forcing himself not  to break into a run as he stepped through the door the Lhari indicated.  It closed behind him. Bart blinked, feeling as if he had stepped into  pitch darkness. Only slowly did his eyes adapt and he became aware that  he was standing in a city street, in the full glow of Procyon sunlight,  and apparently outside the Lhari spaceport entirely.    He'd better get to cover! He took off the Mentorian cloak, thrust it  under his arm. He raised his eyes, which were adjusting to ordinary  light again, and stopped dead.    Just across the street was a long, low, rainbow colored building. And  the letters--Bart blinked, thinking his eyes deceived him--spelled out:        EIGHT COLORS TRANSSHIPPING CORPORATION      CARGO, PASSENGERS, MESSAGES, EXPRESS      A. RAYNOR ONE, MANAGER          CHAPTER FIVE      For a moment the words swirled before Bart's still-watering eyes. He  wiped them, trying to steady himself. Had he so soon reached the end of  his dangerous quest? Somehow he had expected it to lie in deep, dark  concealment.    Raynor One. The existence of Raynor _One_ presupposed a Raynor _Two_ and  probably a Raynor _Three_--for all he knew, Raynors Four, Five, Six, and  Sixty-six! The building looked solid and real. It had evidently been  there a long time.    With his hand on the door, he hesitated. Was it, after all, the _right_  Eight Colors? But it was a family saying; hardly the sort of thing you'd  be apt to hear outside. He pushed the door and went in.    The room was filled with brighter light than the Procyon sun outdoors,  the edges of the furniture rimmed with neon in the Mentorian fashion. A  prim-looking girl sat behind a desk--or what should have been a desk,  except that it looked more like a mirror, with little sparkles of  lights, different colors, in regular rows along one edge. The mirror-top  itself was blue-violet and gave her skin and her violet eyes a bluish  tinge. She was smooth and lacquered and glittering and she raised her  eyebrows at Bart as if he were some strange form of life she hadn't seen  very often.    \"I'd--er--like to see Raynor One,\" he said.    Her dainty pointed fingernail, varnished blue, stabbed at points of  light. \"On what business?\" she asked, not caring.    \"It's a personal matter.\"    \"Then I suggest you see him at his home.\"    \"It can't wait that long.\"    The girl studied the glassy surface and punched at some more of the  little lights. \"Name, please?\"    \"David Briscoe.\"    He had thought her perfect-painted face could not show any emotion  except disdain, but it did. She looked at him in open, blank  consternation. She said into the vision-screen, \"He calls himself David  Briscoe. Yes, I know. Yes, sir, yes.\" She raised her face, and it was  controlled again, but not bored. \"Raynor One will see you. Through that  door, and down to the end of the hall.\"    At the end of the hallway was another door. He stepped through into a  small cubicle, and the door slid shut like a closing trap. He whirled in  panic, then subsided in foolish relief as the cubicle began to rise--it  was just an automatic elevator.    It rose higher and higher, stopping with an abrupt jerk, and slid open  into a lighted room and office. A man sat behind a desk, watching Bart  step from the elevator. The man was very tall and very thin, and the  gray eyes, and the intensity of the lights, told Bart that he was a  Mentorian. _Raynor One?_    Under the steady, stern gray stare, Bart felt the slow, clutching suck  of fear again. Was this man a slave of the Lhari, who would turn him  over to them? Or someone he could trust? His own mother had been a  Mentorian.    \"Who are you?\" Raynor One's voice was harsh, and gave the impression of  being loud, though it was not.    \"David Briscoe.\"    It was the wrong thing. The Mentorian's mouth was taut, forbidding. \"Try  again. I happen to know that David Briscoe is dead.\"    \"I have a message for Raynor Three.\"    The cold gray stare never altered. \"On what business?\"    On a sudden inspiration, Bart said, \"I'll tell you that if you can tell  me what the Eighth Color is.\"    There was a glint in the grim eyes now, though the even, stern voice did  not soften. \"I never knew myself. I didn't name it Eight Colors. Maybe  it's the original owner you want.\"    On a sudden hope, Bart asked, \"Was he, by any chance, named Rupert  Steele?\"    Raynor One made a suspicious movement. \"I can't imagine why you think  so,\" he said guardedly. \"Especially if you've just come in from Earth.  It was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2082"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#7)"],[1,"as  a general, to the brilliant verses in which Voltaire had celebrated his  exploits.         *_La Comedie Francaise_--tr.    The marquis de Chauvelin was equally skilful as a warrior and  diplomatist. Gentle, graceful, and witty, he joined to the most extreme  versatility of talent the utmost simplicity of character. Once known,  he could not fail of being valued and esteemed, and the king entertained  the most lively regard for him. The noble minded marquis was far from  taking advantage of his sovereign's favor, far from it; he neither  boasted of it, nor presumed upon it. This truly wonderful man died,  unhappily, too soon for me, for the king on whom he bestowed the sagest  counsels, and for foreign courts who knew and appreciated his worth.  I shall have occasion to speak of him hereafter; he had a brother, a  wicked little hump-backed creature, brave as Caesar, and a bitter enemy  to the Jesuits, whom he did not a little contribute to overturn in the  parliament of Paris, to which he belonged. The king detested this man  as much as he loved and cherished the brother, and that is saying not a  little.    The fourth guest was the duc de la Vauguyon, the really _perpetual_  tutor to the princes of France, for he had educated four successively.  He had displayed in the army both bravery and talent, but he was a  confirmed Jesuit, and conducted himself towards me upon the strictest  principles of his order. He will appear again on the scene hereafter,  but for the present I must lay him aside, whilst I return to my _entree_  to the saloon, which I was about to enter.    Immediately after Lebel had conducted me into it, he was called away,  and quitted us. The king rose and approached me, saluting me with the  most admirable gallantry, and addressing to me the most encouraging and  gratifying words. His gentle, yet polished manners, fine countenance,  noble air, and the free and unrestrained glances of admiration which  sparkled in his eyes, communicated to me a feeling of support and  confidence which effectually reassured me, and roused me from the  involuntary emotion I had felt at the moment when I first appeared in  his presence. The king addressed a few words to comte Jean, and then  regarded him steadily, as tho' he were trying to recall his features;  but his eye quickly turned on me again, upon whom he bestowed the most  intoxicating attention. Never was first sight more effective, and never  did a flame so rapidly increase as did the passion of my noble adorer.  Ere we had seated ourselves at the supper-table, he was ages gone in  love.    It would have provoked a smile from any countenance to perceive how  the respect and admiration with which the three courtiers regarded  me increased in proportion as the sentiments of the king towards me  betrayed themselves more and more. At first I had been considered as  a person of little or no importance. Soon, however, as their sagacious  eyes discovered the state of their master's mind, the air of familiarity  with which they had regarded me gave place to a more studied politeness,  which, in its turn, as matters progressed, was superseded by the most  delicate attention; and ere we rose from table these gentlemen watched  my looks with the most eager anxiety to obtain the honor of my notice,  and hopes of future patronage from one whom they easily foresaw would be  fully qualified to bestow it. Comte Jean observed all that was passing  in profound silence. As for me, I talked and laughed with perfect  freedom from restraint, and my frank unaffected mirth appeared to  enchant the king; I knew that he was weary of the nice formalities of  courtly beauty, and desired to refresh his eyes and ears with something  less refined, and I gratified him to his heart's wish. The conversation  became lively and animated, the merits of men of letters were discussed,  the French and Italian theatre passed in review before us, and finally,  we amused ourselves with anecdotes relative to the intrigues of court.  The baron de Gonesse related to us a circumstance which had just been  communicated to him by a county magistrate. I must here apprize the  reader that these administrators of justice were directed to collect all  the facts, scandalous, horrible, ridiculous, or piquant, which occurred  within their jurisdiction, in order that, being forwarded to the  king, they might aid in distracting his mind from the heavy cares of  government. Alas! how many strange and eventful things have I since  learned by similar channels.    The supper terminated, the king's friends remained some time conversing  with us. Whilst these noblemen were busily celebrating my praises in  words sufficiently loud to reach the king's ear, the baron de Gonesse,  standing by my side, was prosecuting his suit in the most ardent terms.  I received his overtures with becoming grace and modesty. As I have  before said, the exterior of the king was very prepossessing, and what  he wanted in youth, he made up by all the mature graces of dignified  royalty. At last Lebel appeared, and made me a sign to rise from my  seat. Up to this period nothing had arisen to betray the incognito of  the august monarch, and in order to keep up my pretended ignorance  of his grandeur, I quitted the apartment with little ceremony. Lebel  conducted me to an adjoining chamber, furnished with the utmost  magnificence. When we were seated, he turned to the comte Jean, who had  followed us, and said, \"It rests with yourself whether you will return  to Paris, or remain at Versailles. But as for _milady_, who seems  much fatigued, she will, we trust, honor us by accepting a bed at the  castle.\"    My self-created brother-in-law understood as well as I did the  significance of these words, and clearly read in their import how far  I had attracted the favor of the king. In order to have rendered the  impression more lasting, we could have wished that matters had been less  precipitated, but we were under a roof where everything yielded to the  caprices of its master, and resignation to his will became a matter  of course. And here I trust I may be pardoned if I pass over certain  details which could not, at this lapse of time, interest or amuse any  one; besides, altho' I have found no difficulty in reciting former  events of my life, I find my pen more prudish and coy than were my ears  or mouth. All I shall say is, that the following day, as soon as I was  left alone in my chamber, Lebel entered, and prostrating himself at the  side of my bed,--    \"Madame la comtesse,\" said he, \"is queen and mistress here. Not only has  your noble lover failed to communicate to me the usual signal of disgust  or dislike, but he has spoken of you to me in the most favorable light,  declaring, that, for the first time in his life, he felt the influence  of a true and sincere affection; for this reason he desired I would not  convey to you the contents of this casket, as originally intended.\"    \"And what does it contain?\" asked I, with childish eagerness.    \"Oh, a trifle unworthy of her who is now the mistress of his warmest  love; only a purse containing a hundred louis, and a suit of emeralds  worth a similar sum. He bade me say it might have served to recompense a  mere fleeting fancy, but that it is unworthy of your charms, nor can he  insult you by the offer of it.\"    \"Will he then see me again?\" inquired I.    \"To-morrow evening, if agreeable to you.\"    \"Only say that his wishes are mine.\"    \"Would you wish to see the comte Jean before you rise? He has been  waiting with the utmost impatience to see you since seven o'clock this  morning.\"    \"Let him come in.\"    The comte entered, and I saw by the triumphant joy painted on his face,  that Lebel had told him of propitious state of things. He ran up to me  with outstretched arms, congratulating me upon my success, and putting  at the same time several questions, to which, either from mere womanly  caprice, or presuming upon my recent elevation to the character of prime  favorite, I refused to reply.    My folly drew down on me his severe anger, and several oaths escaped his  lips, which, echoed back by walls so unused to similar violence, struck  Lebel with terror. That faithful ally placed his hand over his mouth,  imploring of him to recollect himself, and the place he was in. As for  me, dreading some foolish burst of his impetuosity, I tried some of my  sweetest smiles, and inviting him to sit beside me, related to him and  Lebel those particulars which my pen refuses to retrace. Amongst other  things, I told them I had said to the king, that I had perfectly known  who he was all the preceding evening when supping with him, and that  he had the simplicity to say, \"he was surprised I had not appeared more  embarrassed in his presence.\"    Our conversation terminated, I wished to return to Paris, and I was,  without further hindrance, allowed to depart. Scarcely had I arrived  there an hour, than I received from his majesty a magnificent diamond  agraffe, worth at least 60,000 francs, and bank notes to the amount of  200,000 livres.    Comte Jean and myself were well nigh stupefied with astonishment at the  sight of such treasures; to us, who had never in our lives possessed  such sums, they appeared inexhaustible. My brother-in-law divided them  into two equal portions, one of which he put into his pocket, and the  other into my _escritoire_. With this arrangement I did not interfere;  nothing seemed to me more simple than that he should satisfy his need  out of my superfluity. I bestowed two thousand crowns upon Henriette,  and expended in the course of the day at least a quarter of my riches  in trifles, as unnecessary as useless; and all this without once  remembering that as I owed my present abundance to a momentary  inclination on the part of the king, so the turn of an hour, or a  fresh fancy on the part of my munificent adorer, might reduce me to the  unprovided state"]]]
