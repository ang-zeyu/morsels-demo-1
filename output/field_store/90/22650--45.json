He hath led me on the paths of       justice, for his own name's sake.         4 For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I       fear no evils, for thou art with me.         Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me.         5 Thou hast prepared a table before me, against them that afflict       me.         Thou hast anointed my head with oil: and my chalice which       inebriateth me how goodly is it.         And thy mercy will follow me all the days of my life.         And that I may dwell in the house of the Lord, unto length of days.    In the Douai version this psalm was called the twenty-second.    Without any special guidance--I think most of my teachers would have  looked on as dangerous any attempt to ally English literature with the  Bible--I soon discovered that nearly everything I read owed something to  the Bible. At first, the comparison of the twenty-third psalm in the  King James version enraptured me so much that I began to find fault with  the Latinized phrases of the Vulgate in English. It was the fashion in  the early seventies to be very Saxon in speech, especially in the  little group at school interested in English literature. Street cars at  this time were comparatively new in Philadelphia, and I think we reached  the last extremity of Saxonism in speech when we spoke of them as \"folk  wains.\" The tide then turned toward the Latins; and I preferred the Book  of Job and the story of Ruth in the Latinized version, because the words  were more mouth filling, and because it was very difficult to translate  everything into a bald \"early English medium\", which for a time I had  been trying to do. It was Keats's lovely phrase \"amid the alien corn\"  which sent me back to \"Ruth\"; and a quotation in Quackenbos's  \"Rhetoric\"--\"Can'st thou hook the Leviathan\" which made me revel in  \"Job.\"    Something Meg Merrilies said bore me on toward the roaring storm of  Isaiah. The Latinized medium seemed to suit his denunciations best; and  then, besides, I found more illuminating footnotes in the Douai version  than in the King James. In both versions, some passages were so obscure  that I often wondered how anybody could get any meaning out of them. I  was often astonished to find in English novels that the old people in  the cottages were soothed by texts, quoted at a great length, out of  which I could make nothing, so I limited myself to the Douai version,  which I found more illuminating.    Whether my system of reading is to be commended or not to young persons,  I am not prepared to say, but for me it made the Bible a really live  book. To be frank, and perhaps shocking at the same time--if anybody had  asked me whether, being marooned on an island, I should have most  preferred the Bible in my loneliness, I should promptly have answered  \"No.\" At this age \"Nicholas Nickleby\" or \"Midsummer Night's Dream,\" or  \"The Tempest,\" or \"As You Like it,\" or Macaulay's \"Lays of Ancient  Rome,\" would have suited me better, provided, of course, that I could  have chosen only one book.    It was borne in on me many times that no author could improve on the  phrasing of the Bible. Both in the Vulgate and the King James versions  there are passages which, leaving aside all question of doctrine, it is  sacrilege to try to improve. The French translation of the Bible is, as  everybody knows, very paraphrastic, and that may account for the fact  that, while regarded as a precious depository of doctrine, it is not a  household book, and the dreadfully dull interpretations of Clement  Marot--called hymns--naturally bored a people who, in their hearts,  believe that God listens more amiably to petitions uttered in the  language of the Academy! In their novels, dealing with the beginnings of  Christianity--and there are many such novels in French unknown in other  countries--it is hard for a French author not to be rhetorical, in the  manner of the writer of \"Ben Hur\" when the death of Christ is described.  No human author could improve on the words of the Vulgate, or the words  of the King James version. What young heart can ponder over these words,  without a thrill, St. John XIX (Douai version: 1609; Rheims; 1582):         When Jesus therefore had seen his Mother and the disciple standing       whom he loved, he saith to his Mother: Woman, behold thy son.         After that, he saith to the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from       that day the disciple took her to his own.         Afterwards, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,       that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said: I thirst.         Now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar, and they, putting       a sponge full of vinegar about hyssop, put it to his mouth.         And Jesus therefore when he had taken the vinegar, said, it is       consummated, and bowing his head, gave up the ghost.    When Marie Corelli became a popular author, there were persons  existing--happily, they have all gone to the great beyond--who thought  that the \"talented\" author could have done better!      _Essays and Essayists_    I am aware that many persons look on Emerson as somewhat dangerous  reading for a boy of sixteen. The mothers and fathers of my Baptist  friends and the uncle of my Methodist cousins forbade the reading of  Emerson because of his Unitarianism; but, as the rector of our parish  never denounced Unitarians from the altar, though he frequently offered  his compliments to Martin Luther, I paid no attention whatever to these  objections. I trust that I am not defending the miscellaneous reading of  my boyhood; I do not recommend this course to the approval of parents  and guardians; I am simply expressing the impression that certain books  made on my youthful mind and heart; for, though I never said so in  words, the books I liked were always nearer to my heart than to my mind.  I owe a great debt to Emerson.    It was on a hot afternoon during the summer vacation that, near sundown,  sitting on the warm marble steps of our house, I dipped into an early  edition of Emerson. I felt inspired at once to think great thoughts and  to do good things, to lift myself above the petty things of the earth,  and to feel that to be an American was to be at once proud and humble.  Emerson's abrupt sentences, like a number of brilliants set close  together, reminded me of \"Proverbs\"; but the Book of Proverbs did not  get so near to my actual life as the essays of Emerson. I liked the  lessons that he drew from the lives of great men. I was shocked when he  mentioned Confucius and Plato in the same breath as Christ; but I was  amiably tolerant, for I felt that he had never had the privilege of  studying the Little Catechism, and I thought of writing to him on the  subject. But somebody told me that he was an \"American Classic\" and,  from that, I concluded he was dead, and had doubtless already found out  his mistake.    Perhaps I might have been better engaged in reading the more practical  books offered to boys in our own time, if we had had them. There were  some books then on scientific subjects, reduced to the comprehension of  the young; but not so many as there are now. One of my uncles  recommended the works of Samuel Smiles--\"Self-Help\" I think was his  favourite; but Samuel Smiles never appealed to me. My small allowance,  paid weekly, could not have been affected by \"Thrift\", and when my uncle  quoted passages from this tiresome book I astounded him by replying, in  a phrase I wrongly attributed to the adorable Emerson, that if I had a  quarter to spend instead of twelve cents, I would give half of it for a  hyacinth! My miserly uncle said it sounded just like Mohammed, and that  Emerson had doubtless found it in that dangerous book, the Koran.    I cannot imagine any other author doing for me just what the essays of  Emerson did. In the first place, they seemed to me to be really  American; in the second, and largely because of their quality, they  offered an antidote to the materialism in the very air, which had  succeeded the Civil War. At this time there was much talk of money and  luxury everywhere about us. Even in our quiet neighbourhood, where  simple living was the rule, many had burst into ostentation, and moved  away into newer and more pretentious quarters, and there was a rumour  that some of these sought unlimited opportunities for extravagant  expenditure. We saw them driving in new carriages, and condescendingly  stopping before the white doors and the green window-shutters of our  old-fashioned colonial houses. They had made money through the war. For  the first time in our lives we boys heard of money making as the  principal aim of life. The fact that these successful persons were  classed as \"shoddy\" did not lessen the value of the auriferous  atmosphere about us. Emerson was a corrective to this materialism. As to  his philosophy or theology, that did not concern me any more than the  religious opinions of Julius Caesar, whose \"Commentaries\" I was obliged  to read. Emerson gave me a taste for the reading of essay.    By chance I fell upon some essays of Carlyle. The inflation of his style  did not deter me from thoroughly enjoying the paper on \"Novalis.\" That  on \"Cagliostro,\" however, was my favourite. It introduced me intimately  to the French Revolution. I disliked this great charlatan for his motto,  \"Tread the lilies under foot.\" I was for the Bourbons! The French  Revolution, as a fact, was very near to me. My mother had been born (in  Philadelphia) in 1819, and my great-uncle and my grandfather had lived  through the French Revolution. There was a legend, moreover--probably  the same legend exists in every family of Irish descent whose  connections had lived in France--that one of them had been a clerk to  Fabre d'Eglantine, and had spent his time in crossing off the list of  the condemned the names of the Irish-French"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#7)"],[1,"before, he had rather not.  Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the  chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly;  and, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick  wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the  evergreens like spray.    [Illustration: HE PRODUCED A DECANTER OF CURIOUSLY LIGHT WINE, AND A  BLOCK OF CURIOUSLY HEAVY CAKE]    'Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,' said  the Ghost. 'But she had a large heart!'    'So she had,' cried Scrooge. 'You're right. I will not gainsay it,  Spirit. God forbid!'    'She died a woman,' said the Ghost, 'and had, as I think, children.'    'One child,' Scrooge returned.    'True,' said the Ghost. 'Your nephew!'    Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, 'Yes.'    Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were  now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed  and re-passed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and  all the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough,  by the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time  again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.    The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he  knew it.    'Know it!' said Scrooge. 'Was I apprenticed here?'    They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting  behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must  have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great  excitement--    'Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!'    Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which  pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his  capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his  organ of benevolence; and called out, in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,  jovial voice--    'Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!'    Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,  accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.    'Dick Wilkins, to be sure!' said Scrooge to the Ghost. 'Bless me, yes.  There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear,  dear!'    'Yo ho, my boys!' said Fezziwig. 'No more work to-night. Christmas Eve,  Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up,' cried old  Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, 'before a man can say Jack  Robinson!'    You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into  the street with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in their  places--four, five, six--barred 'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight,  nine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like  racehorses.    'Hilli-ho!' cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with  wonderful agility. 'Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room  here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!'    Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or  couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in  a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from  public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps  were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as  snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to  see upon a winter's night.    In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and  made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came  Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss  Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose  hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the  business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin the baker. In came the  cook with her brother's particular friend the milkman. In came the boy  from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his  master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one,  who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all  came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some  awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, any how and  every how. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round  and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and  round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always  turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again as soon  as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help  them! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his  hands to stop the dance, cried out, 'Well done!' and the fiddler plunged  his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose.  But, scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began again,  though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been  carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man  resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.    [Illustration: _Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs.  Fezziwig_]    There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and  there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold  Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were  mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came  after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The  sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told  it him!) struck up 'Sir Roger de Coverley.' Then old Fezziwig stood  out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff  piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of  partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would  dance, and had no notion of walking.    But if they had been twice as many--ah! four times--old Fezziwig would  have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to _her_, she  was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that's not  high praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared  to issue from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the dance  like moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given time, what would  become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone  all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner,  bow and curtsy, cork-screw, thread-the-needle, and back again to your  place: Fezziwig 'cut'--cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his  legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.    When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.  Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side the door, and, shaking  hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him  or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two  'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died  away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter  in the back-shop.    During the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his  wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He  corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and  underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright  faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he  remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon  him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.    'A small matter,' said the Ghost, 'to make these silly folks so full of  gratitude.'    'Small!' echoed Scrooge.    The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were  pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig; and when he had done so,  said:    'Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money:  three or four, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?'    'It isn't that,' said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking  unconsciously like his former, not his latter self. 'It isn't that,  Spirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our  service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power  lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it  is impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness he gives  is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.'    He felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.    'What is the matter?' asked the Ghost.    'Nothing particular,' said Scrooge.    'Something, I think?' the Ghost insisted.    'No,' said Scrooge, 'no. I should like to be able to say a word or two  to my clerk just now. That's all.'    His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish;  and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.    'My time grows short,' observed the Spirit. 'Quick!'    This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but  it produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was  older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and  rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care  and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,  which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of  the growing tree would fall.    He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning  dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that  shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.    'It matters little,' she said softly. 'To you, very little. Another idol  has displaced me; and, if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come  as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.'    'What Idol has displaced you?' he rejoined.    'A golden one.'    'Th"]]]
