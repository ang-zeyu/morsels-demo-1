When the giant herd is moving at the rising of the sun,        And the prairie is lit with rose and gold;      And the camp is all a-bustle, and the busy day's begun,        He leaps into the saddle sure and bold.      Through the round of heat and hurry, through the racket and the rout,        He rattles at a pace that nothing mars;      And when the night-winds whisper, and camp-fires flicker out,        He is sleeping like a child beneath the stars.        When the wattle-blooms are drooping in the sombre she-oak glade,        And the breathless land is lying in a swoon,      He leaves his work a moment, leaning lightly on his spade,        And he hears the bell-bird chime the Austral noon.      The parakeets are silent in the gum-tree by the creek;        The ferny grove is sunshine-steeped and still;      But the dew will gem the myrtle in the twilight ere he seek        His little lonely cabin on the hill.        Around the purple, vine-clad slope the argent river dreams;        The roses almost hide the house from view;      A snow-peak of the Winterberg in crimson splendour gleams;        The shadow deepens down on the karroo.      He seeks the lily-scented dusk beneath the orange-tree:        His pipe in silence glows and fades and glows,      And then two little maids come out and climb upon his knee,        And one is like the lily, one the rose.      He sees his white sheep dapple o'er the green New Zealand plain,        And where Vancouver's shaggy ramparts frown,      When the sunlight threads the pine-gloom he is fighting might and main        To clinch the rivets of an Empire down.      You will find him toiling, toiling, in the south or in the west,        A child of nature, fearless, frank and free;      And the warmest heart that beats for you is beating in his breast,        And he sends you loyal greeting o'er the sea.        You've a brother in the Army, you've another in the Church;        One of you is a diplomatic swell;      You've had the pick of everything and left him in the lurch;        And yet I think he's doing very well.      I'm sure his life is happy, and he doesn't envy yours;        I know he loves the land his pluck has won;      And I fancy in the years unborn, while England's fame endures,        She will come to bless with pride--the Younger Son.          THE MARCH OF THE DEAD          The cruel war was over--oh, the triumph was so sweet!        We watched the troops returning, through our tears;      There was triumph, triumph, triumph down the scarlet glittering street,        And you scarce could hear the music for the cheers.      And you scarce could see the house-tops for the flags that flew            between,        The bells were pealing madly to the sky;      And every one was shouting for the Soldiers of the Queen,        And the glory of an age was passing by.        And then there came a shadow, swift and sudden, dark and drear;        The bells were silent, not an echo stirred.      The flags were drooping sullenly, the men forgot to cheer;        We waited, and we never spoke a word.      The sky grew darker, darker, till from out the gloomy rack        There came a voice that checked the heart with dread:      \"Tear down, tear down your bunting now, and hang up sable black;        They are coming--it's the Army of the Dead.\"        They were coming, they were coming, gaunt and ghastly, sad and slow;        They were coming, all the crimson wrecks of pride;      With faces seared, and cheeks red smeared, and haunting eyes of woe,        And clotted holes the khaki couldn't hide.      Oh, the clammy brow of anguish! the livid, foam-flecked lips!        The reeling ranks of ruin swept along!      The limb that trailed, the hand that failed, the bloody finger-tips!        And oh, the dreary rhythm of their song!        \"They left us on the veldt-side, but we felt we couldn't stop,        On this, our England's crowning festal day;      We're the men of Magersfontein, we're the men of Spion Kop,        Colenso,--we're the men who had to pay.      We're the men who paid the blood-price. Shall the grave be all our            gain?        You owe us. Long and heavy is the score.      Then cheer us for our glory now, and cheer us for our pain,        And cheer us as ye never cheered before.\"        The folks were white and stricken, and each tongue seemed weighed            with lead;        Each heart was clutched in hollow hand of ice;      And every eye was staring at the horror of the dead,        The pity of the men who paid the price.      They were come, were come to mock us, in the first flush of our peace;        Through writhing lips their teeth were all agleam;      They were coming in their thousands--oh, would they never cease!        I closed my eyes, and then--it was a dream.        There was triumph, triumph, triumph down the scarlet gleaming street;        The town was mad, a man was like a boy.      A thousand flags were flaming where the sky and city meet;        A thousand bells were thundering the joy.      There was music, mirth and sunshine; but some eyes shone with regret:        And while we stun with cheers our homing braves,      O God, in Thy great mercy, let us nevermore forget        The graves they left behind, the bitter graves.          \"FIGHTING MAC\"    A LIFE TRAGEDY          A pistol-shot rings round and round the world:        In pitiful defeat a warrior lies.      A last defiance to dark Death is hurled,        A last wild challenge shocks the sunlit skies.        Alone he falls with wide, wan, woeful eyes:      Eyes that could smile at death--could not face shame.        Alone, alone he paced his narrow room,        In the bright sunshine of that Paris day;      Saw in his thought the awful hand of doom;        Saw in his dream his glory pass away;        Tried in his heart, his weary heart, to pray:      \"O God! who made me, give me strength to face      The spectre of this bitter, black disgrace.\"               *       *       *       *       *        The burn brawls darkly down the shaggy glen,        The bee-kissed heather blooms around the door;      He sees himself a barefoot boy again,        Bending o'er page of legendary lore.        He hears the pibroch, grips the red claymore,      Runs with the Fiery Cross a clansman true,      Sworn kinsman of Rob Roy and Roderick Dhu.        Eating his heart out with a wild desire,        One day, behind his counter trim and neat,      He hears a sound that sets his brain afire--        The Highlanders are marching down the street.        Oh, how the pipes shrill out, the mad drums beat!      \"On to the gates of Hell, my Gordons gay!\"      He flings his hated yardstick far away.        He sees the sullen pass, high-crowned with snow,        Where Afghans cower with eyes of gleaming hate.      He hurls himself against the hidden foe.        They try to rally--ah, too late, too late!        Again, defenceless, with fierce eyes that wait      For death, he stands, like baited bull at bay,      And flouts the Boers, that mad Majuba day.        He sees again the murderous Soudan,        Blood-slaked and rapine swept. He seems to stand      Upon the gory plain of Omdurman.        Then Magersfontein, and supreme command        Over his Highlanders. To shake his hand      A King is proud, and princes call him friend,      And glory crowns his life--and now the end.        The awful end. His eyes are dark with doom;        He hears the shrapnel shrieking overhead:      He sees the ravaged ranks, the flame-stabbed gloom.        Oh, to have fallen! the battle-field his bed,        With Wauchope and his glorious brother-dead.      Why was he saved for this, for this? And now      He raises the revolver to his brow.               *       *       *       *       *        In many a Highland home, framed with rude art,        You'll find his portrait, rough-hewn, stern and square:      It's graven in the Fuyam fellah's heart;        The Ghurka reads it at his evening prayer;        The raw lands know it, where the fierce suns glare;      The Dervish fears it. Honour to his name,      Who holds aloft the shield of England's fame.        Mourn for our hero, men of Northern race!        We do not know his sin; we only know      His sword was keen. He laughed death in the face,        And struck, for Empire's sake, a giant blow.        His arm was strong. Ah! well they learnt, the foe.      The echo of his deeds is ringing yet,      Will ring for aye. All else ... let us forget.          THE WOMAN AND THE ANGEL          An angel was tired of heaven, as he lounged in the golden street;      His halo was tilted sideways, and his harp lay mute at his feet;      So the Master stooped in His pity, and gave him a pass to go,      For the space of a moon, to the earth-world, to mix with the men below.        He doffed his celestial garments, scarce waiting to lay them straight;      He bade goodbye to Peter, who stood by the golden gate;      The sexless singers of heaven chanted a fond farewell,      And the imps looked up as they pattered on the red-hot flags of hell.        Never was seen such an angel: eyes of a heavenly blue,      Features that shamed Apollo, hair of a golden hue;      The women simply adored him, his lips were like Cupid's bow;      But he never ventured to use them--and so they voted him slow.        Till at last there came One Woman, a marvel of loveliness,      And she whispered to him: \"Do you love me?\" And he answered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25550"],[0,"The Defiant Agents (#7)"],[1,"when the ship from  the old days took us off, unwilling, to the stars. Did you not all  volunteer to pioneer in this manner so you could also see strange and  new things?\"    \"But we did not agree to be returned to the past in medicine dreams and  be sent unknowingly into space!\"    Travis nodded. \"Deklay is right. But I know no more than you why we were  so sent, or why the ship crashed. We have found Dr. Ruthven's body in  the cabin with that new installation. Only we have discovered nothing  else which tells us why we were brought here. With the ship broken, we  must stay.\"    They were silent now, men and women alike. Behind them lay several days  of activity, nights of exhausted slumber. Against the cliff wall lay the  packs of supplies they had salvaged from the wreck. By mutual consent  they had left the vicinity of the broken globe, following their old  custom of speedily withdrawing from a place of death.    \"This is a world empty of men?\" Jil-Lee wanted to know.    \"So far we have found only animal signs, and the _ga-n_ have not warned  us of anything else----\"    \"Those devil ones!\" Again Deklay spat into the fire. \"I say we should  have no dealings with them. The _mba'a_ is no friend to the People.\"    Again a murmur which seemed one of agreement answered that outburst.  Travis stiffened. Just how much influence had the Redax had over them?  He knew from his own experience that sometimes he had an odd double  reaction--two different feelings which almost sickened him when they  struck simultaneously. And he was beginning to suspect that with some of  the others the return to the past had been far more deep and lasting.  Now Jil-Lee was actually to reason out what had happened. While Deklay  had reverted to an ancestor who had ridden with Victorio or Magnus  Colorado! Travis had a flash of premonition, a chill which made him  half foresee a time when the past and the present might well split them  apart--fatally.    \"Devil or _ga-n_.\" A man with a quiet face, rather deeply sunken eyes,  spoke for the first time. \"We are in two minds because of this Redax, so  let us not do anything in haste. Back in the desert world of the People  I have seen the _mba'a_, and he was very clever. With the badger he went  hunting, and when the badger had dug up the rat's nest, so did the  _mba'a_ wait on the other side of the thorny bush and catch those who  would escape that way. Between him and the badger there was no war.  These two who sit over yonder now--they are also hunters and they seem  friendly to us. In a strange place a man needs all the help he can find.  Let us not call names out of old tales, which may mean nothing in fact.\"    \"Buck speaks straightly,\" Jil-Lee agreed. \"We seek a camp which can be  defended. For perhaps there are men here whose hunting territory we have  invaded, though we have not yet seen them. We are a people small in  number and alone. Let us walk softly on trails which are strange to our  feet.\"    Inwardly Travis sighed in relief. Buck, Jil-Lee ... for the moment their  sensible words appeared to swing the opinions of the party. If either of  them could be established as _haldzil_, or clan leader, they would all  be safer. He himself had no aspirations in that direction and dared not  push too hard. It had been his initial urging which had brought them as  volunteers into the project. Now he was doubly suspect, and especially  by those who thought as Deklay, he was considered too alien to their old  ways.    So far their protests had been fewer than he anticipated. Although  brothers and sisters had followed each other into the team after the  immemorial desire of Apaches to cling to family ties, they were not a  true clan with solidity of that to back them, but representatives of  half a dozen.    Basically, back on Terra, they had all been among the most progressive  of their people--progressive, that is, in the white man's sense of the  word. Travis had a fleeting recognition of his now oblique way of  thinking. He, too, had been marked by the Redax. They had all been  educated in the modern fashion and all possessed a spirit of adventure  which marked them over their fellows. They had volunteered for the team  and successfully passed the tests to weed out the temperamentally unfit  or fainthearted. But all that was before Redax....    Why had they been submitted to that? And why this flight? What had  pushed Dr. Ashe and Murdock and Colonel Kelgarries, time agents he knew  and trusted, into dispatching them without warning to Topaz? Something  had happened, something which had given Dr. Ruthven ascendancy over  those others and had started them on this wild trip.    Travis was conscious of a stir about the firelit circle. The men were  rising, moving back into the shadows, stretching out on the blankets  they had found among other stores on the ship. They had discovered  weapons there--knives, bows, quivers of arrows, all of which they had  been trained to use in the intensive schooling of the project and which  needed no more repair than they themselves could give. And the rations  they carried were field supplies, few of them. Tomorrow they must begin  hunting in earnest....    \"Why has this thing been done to us?\" Buck was beside Travis, those  quiet eyes sliding past him to seek the fire once more. \"I do not think  you were told when the rest of us were not----\"    Travis seized upon that. \"There are those who say that I knew, agreed?\"    \"That is so. Once we stood at the same place in time--in our thoughts,  our desires. Now we stand at many places, as if we climbed a stairway,  each at his own speed--a stairway the Pinda-lick-o-yi has set us upon.  Some here, some there, some yet farther above....\" He sketched a series  of step outlines in the air. \"And in this there is trouble--\"    \"The truth,\" Travis agreed. \"Yet it is also true that I knew nothing of  this, that I climb with you on these stairs.\"    \"So I believe. But there comes a time when it is best not to be a woman  stirring a pot of boiling stew but rather one who stands quietly at a  distance--\"    \"You mean?\" Travis pressed.    \"I say that alone among us you have crossed the stars before, therefore  new things are not so hard to understand. And we need a scout. Also the  coyotes run in your footsteps, and you do not fear them.\"    It made good sense. Let him scout ahead of the party, taking the coyotes  with him. Stay away from the camp for a while and speak small--until the  people on Buck's stairway were more closely united.    \"I go in the morning,\" Travis agreed. He could slip away tonight, but  just now he could not force himself away from the fire, from the  companionship.    \"You might take Tsoay with you,\" Buck continued.    Travis waited for him to enlarge on that suggestion. Tsoay was one of  the youngest of their group, Buck's own cross-cousin and near-brother.    \"It is well,\" Buck explained, \"that we learn this land, and it has  always been our custom that the younger walk in the footprints of the  older. Also, not only should trails be learned, but also men.\"    Travis caught the thought behind that. Perhaps by taking the younger men  as scouts, one after another, he could build up among them a following  of sorts. Among the Apaches, leadership was wholly a matter of  personality. Until the reservation days, chieftains had gained their  position by force of character alone, though they might come  successively from one family clan over several generations.    He did not want the chieftainship here. No, but neither did he want  growing whispers working about him to cut him off from his people. To  every Apache severance from the clan was a little death. He must have  those who would back him if Deklay, or those who thought like Deklay,  turned grumbling into open hostility.    \"Tsoay is one quick to learn,\" Travis agreed. \"We go at dawn--\"    \"Along the mountain range?\" Buck inquired.    \"If we seek a protected place for the rancheria, yes. The mountains have  always provided good strongholds for the People.\"    \"And you think there is need for a fort?\"    Travis shrugged. \"I have been one day's journey out into this world. I  saw nothing but animals. But that is no promise that elsewhere there are  no enemies. The planet was on the tapes we brought back from that other  world, and so it was known to the others who once rode between star and  star as we rode between ranch and town. If they had this world set on a  journey tape, it was for a reason; that reason may still be in force.\"    \"Yet it was long ago that these star people rode so....\" Buck mused.  \"Would the reason last so long?\"    Travis remembered two other worlds, one of weird desert inhabited by  beast things--or had they once been human, human to the point of  possessing intelligence?--that had come out of sand burrows at night to  attack a spaceship. And the second world where the ruins of a giant city  had stood choked with jungle vegetation, where he had made a blowgun  from tubes of rustless metal as a weapon gift for small winged men--but  were they men? Both had been remnants of that ancient galactic empire.    \"Some things could so remain,\" he answered soberly. \"If we find them, we  must be careful. But first a good site for the rancheria.\"    \"There is no return to home for us,\" Buck stated flatly.    \"Why do you say that? There could be a rescue ship later--\"    The other raised his eyes again to Travis. \"When you slept under the  Redax how did you ride?\"    \"As a warrior--raiding ... living....\"    \"And I--I was one with _go'ndi_,\" Buck returned simply.    \"But--\"    \"But the white man has assured us that such power--the power of a  chief--does not exist? Yes, the Pinda-lick-o-yi has told us so many  things. He is busy, busy with his tools, his machines, always busy. And  those who think in another fashion cannot be measured by his rules, so  they are foolish dreamers. Not all white men think so. There was Dr.  Ashe--"]]]
