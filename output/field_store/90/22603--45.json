So if one parent <?> fish  deposits its egg in infinitesimally different circumstances, as in  rather shallower or deeper water &c., it will then <?> tell.         {59} In a rough summary at the close of the Essay, occur the       words:--\"Every creature lives by a struggle, smallest grain in       balance must tell.\"         {60} Cf. _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 77, vi. p. 94.    Let hares{61} increase very slowly from change of climate affecting  peculiar plants, and some other <illegible> rabbit decrease in same  proportion [let this unsettle organisation of], a canine animal, who  formerly derived its chief sustenance by springing on rabbits or  running them by scent, must decrease too and might thus readily become  exterminated. But if its form varied very slightly, the long legged  fleet ones, during a thousand years being selected, and the less fleet  rigidly destroyed must, if no law of nature be opposed to it, alter  forms.         {61} This is a repetition of what is given at p. 6.    Remember how soon Bakewell on the same principle altered cattle and  Western, sheep,--carefully avoiding a cross (pigeons) with any breed.  We cannot suppose that one plant tends to vary in fruit and another  in flower, and another in flower and foliage,--some have been selected  for both fruit and flower: that one animal varies in its covering and  another not,--another in its milk. Take any organism and ask what is  it useful for and on that point it will be found to vary,--cabbages  in their leaf,--corn in size <and> quality of grain, both in times  of year,--kidney beans for young pod and cotton for envelope of seeds  &c. &c.: dogs in intellect, courage, fleetness and smell <?>: pigeons  in peculiarities approaching to monsters. This requires  consideration,--should be introduced in first chapter if it holds, I  believe it does. It is hypothetical at best{62}.         {62} Compare _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 41, vi. p. 47. \"I have seen it       gravely remarked, that it was most fortunate that the strawberry       began to vary just when gardeners began to attend closely to this       plant. No doubt the strawberry had always varied since it was       cultivated, but the slight varieties had been neglected.\"    Nature's variation far less, but such selection far more rigid and  scrutinising. Man's races not [even so well] only not better adapted to  conditions than other races, but often not <?> one race adapted to its  conditions, as man keeps and propagates some alpine plants in garden.  Nature lets <an> animal live, till on actual proof it is found less able  to do the required work to serve the desired end, man judges solely by  his eye, and knows not whether nerves, muscles, arteries, are developed  in proportion to the change of external form.    Besides selection by death, in bisexual animals <illegible> the  selection in time of fullest vigour, namely struggle of males; even in  animals which pair there seems a surplus <?> and a battle, possibly as in  man more males produced than females, struggle of war or charms{63}.  Hence that male which at that time is in fullest vigour, or best armed  with arms or ornaments of its species, will gain in hundreds of  generations some small advantage and transmit such characters to its  offspring. So in female rearing its young, the most vigorous and skilful  and industrious, <whose> instincts <are> best developed, will rear more  young, probably possessing her good qualities, and a greater number will  thus <be> prepared for the struggle of nature. Compared to man using a  male alone of good breed. This latter section only of limited  application, applies to variation of [specific] sexual characters.  Introduce here contrast with Lamarck,--absurdity of habit, or chance??  or external conditions, making a woodpecker adapted to tree{64}.         {63} Here we have the two types of sexual selection discussed in       the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 88 et seq., vi. pp. 108 et seq.         {64} It is not obvious why the author objects to \"chance\" or       \"external conditions making a woodpecker.\" He allows that variation       is ultimately referable to conditions and that the nature of the       connexion is unknown, i.e. that the result is fortuitous. It is not       clear in the original to how much of the passage the two ? refer.    Before considering difficulties of theory of selection let us consider  character of the races produced, as now explained, by nature. Conditions  have varied slowly and the organisms best adapted in their whole course  of life to the changed conditions have always been selected,--man  selects small dog and afterwards gives it profusion of food,--selects a  long-backed and short-legged breed and gives it no particular exercise  to suit this function &c. &c. In ordinary cases nature has not allowed  her race to be contaminated with a cross of another race, and  agriculturists know how difficult they find always to prevent  this,--effect would be trueness. This character and sterility when  crossed, and generally a greater amount of difference, are two main  features, which distinguish domestic races from species.    [Sterility not universal admitted by all{65}. _Gladiolus_, _Crinum_,  _Calceolaria_{66} must be species if there be such a thing. Races of  dogs and oxen: but certainly very general; indeed a gradation of  sterility most perfect{67} very general. Some nearest species will not  cross (crocus, some heath <?>), some genera cross readily (fowls{68} and  grouse, peacock &c.). Hybrids no ways monstrous quite perfect except  secretions{69} hence even the mule has bred,--character of sterility,  especially a few years ago <?> thought very much more universal than it now  is, has been thought the distinguishing character; indeed it is obvious  if all forms freely crossed, nature would be a chaos. But the very  gradation of the character, even if it always existed in some degree  which it does not, renders it impossible as marks <?> those <?> suppose  distinct as species{70}]. Will analogy throw any light on the fact of  the supposed races of nature being sterile, though none of the domestic  ones are? Mr Herbert <and> Koelreuter have shown external differences will  not guide one in knowing whether hybrids will be fertile or not, but the  chief circumstance is constitutional differences{71}, such as being  adapted to different climate or soil, differences which [must] probably  affect the whole body of the organism and not any one part. Now wild  animals, taken out of their natural conditions, seldom breed. I do not  refer to shows or to Zoological Societies where many animals unite, but  <do not?> breed, and others will never unite, but to wild animals caught  and kept _quite tame_ left loose and well fed about houses and living  many years. Hybrids produced almost as readily as pure breds. St Hilaire  great distinction of tame and domestic,--elephants,--ferrets{72}.  Reproductive organs not subject to disease in Zoological Garden.  Dissection and microscope show that hybrid is in exactly same condition  as another animal in the intervals of breeding season, or those animals  which taken wild and _not bred_ in domesticity, remain without breeding  their whole lives. It should be observed that so far from domesticity  being unfavourable in itself <it> makes more fertile: [when animal is  domesticated and breeds, productive power increased from more food and  selection of fertile races]. As far as animals go might be thought <an>  effect on their mind and a special case.         {65} The meaning is \"That sterility is not universal is admitted by       all.\"         {66} See _Var. under Dom._, Ed. 2, i. p. 388, where the garden       forms of _Gladiolus_ and _Calceolaria_ are said to be derived from       crosses between distinct species. Herbert's hybrid _Crinums_ are       discussed in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 250, vi. p. 370. It is well       known that the author believed in a multiple origin of domestic       dogs.         {67} The argument from gradation in sterility is given in the       _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 248, 255, vi. pp. 368, 375. In the _Origin_, I       have not come across the cases mentioned, viz. crocus, heath, or       grouse and fowl or peacock. For sterility between closely allied       species, see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 257, vi. p. 377. In the present       essay the author does not distinguish between fertility between       species and the fertility of the hybrid offspring, a point on which       he insists in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 245, vi. p. 365.         {68} Ackermann (_Ber. d. Vereins f. Naturkunde zu Kassel_, 1898, p.       23) quotes from Gloger that a cross has been effected between a       domestic hen and a _Tetrao tetrix_; the offspring died when three       days old.         {69} No doubt the sexual cells are meant. I do not know on what       evidence it is stated that the mule has bred.         {70} The sentence is all but illegible. I think that the author       refers to forms usually ranked as varieties having been marked as       species when it was found that they were sterile together. See the       case of the red and blue _Anagallis_ given from Gaertner in the       _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 247, vi. p. 368.         {71} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 258, where the author speaks of       constitutional differences in this connexion, he specifies that       they are confined to the reproductive system.         {72} The sensitiveness of the reproductive system to changed       conditions is insisted on in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 8, vi. p. 10.         The ferret is mentioned, as being prolific in captivity, in _Var.       under Dom._, Ed. 2, ii. p. 90.    But turning to plants we find same class of facts. I do not refer to  seeds not ripening, perhaps the commonest cause, but to plants not  setting, which either is owing to some imperfection of ovule or pollen.  Lindley says sterility is the [curse]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2273"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat; Or, The Rivals of Lake Carlopa (#7)"],[1,"the engine an electrical device,  without which the motor in the ARROW could not be started.    \"That will prevent them from running away with my boat, anyhow,\"  decided Tom.  \"And I'll tell Garret Jackson to keep a sharp watch  to-night.\" Jackson was the engineer at Mr. Swift's workshop.    Tom told his father of the happening and Mr. Swift was properly  indignant.  He wanted to go at once to see Mr. Foger and complain of  Andy's act, but Tom counseled waiting.    \"I'll attend to Andy myself,\" said the young inventor.  \"He's getting  desperate, I guess, or he wouldn't try to set the place on fire.  But  wait until I show him these keys.\"    Bright and early the next morning the owner of the motor-boat was down  to the dock inspecting it.  The engineer, who had been on watch part of  the night, reported that there had been no disturbance, and Tom found  everything all right.  \"I wonder if I'd better go over and accuse Andy  now or wait until I see him and spring this evidence on him?\" thought  our hero.  Then he decided it would be better to wait.  He took the  ARROW out after breakfast, his father going on a short spin with him.    \"But I must go back now and work on my gyroscope invention,\" said Mr.  Swift when about two hours had been spent on the lake.  \"I am making  good progress with it.\"    \"You need a vacation,\" decided Tom, \"I'll be ready to take you and Ned  in about two weeks.  He will have two weeks off then and, we'll have  some glorious times together.\"    That afternoon Tom put some new style spark plugs in the cylinders of  his motor and found that he had considerably increased the revolutions  of the engine, due to a better explosion being obtained.  He also made  some minor adjustments and the next day he went out alone for a long  run.    Heading up the lake, Tom was soon in sight of a popular excursion  resort that was frequently visited by church and Sunday-school  organizations in the vicinity of Shopton.  The lad saw a number of  rowing craft and a small motor-boat circling around opposite the resort  and remarked: \"There must be a picnic at the grove to-day.  Guess I'll  run up and take a look.\"    The lad was soon in the midst of quite a flotilla of rowboats, most of  them manned by pretty girls or in charge of boys who were giving  sisters (their own or some other chap's) a trip on the water.  Tom  throttled his boat down to slow speed and looked with pleasure on the  pretty scene.  His boat attracted considerable attention, for motor  craft were not numerous on Lake Carlopa.    As our hero passed a boat, containing three very pretty young ladies,  Tom heard one of them exclaim:    \"There he is now!  That's Tom Swift.\"    Something in the tones of the voice attracted his attention.  He turned  and saw a brown-eyed girl smiling at him.  She bowed and asked,  blushing the while:    \"Well, have you caught any more runaway horses lately?\"    \"Runaway horses--why--what?  Oh, it's Miss Nestor!\" exclaimed the lad,  recognizing the young lady whose steed he had frightened one day when  he was on his bicycle.  As told in the first volume of this series, the  horse had run away, being alarmed at the flashing of Tom's wheel, and  Miss Mary Nestor, of Mansburg, was in grave danger.    \"So you've given up the bicycle for the motor-boat,\" went on the young  lady.    \"Yes,\" replied Tom with a smile, shutting off the power, \"and I haven't  had a chance to save any girls since I've had it.\"    The two boats had drifted close together, and Miss Nestor introduced  her two companions to Tom.    \"Don't you want to come in and take a ride?\" he asked.    \"Is it safe?\" asked Jennie Haddon, one of the trio.    \"Of course it is, Jennie, or he wouldn't be out in it,\" said Miss  Nestor hastily.  \"Come on, let's get in.  I'm just dying for a  motor-boat ride.\"    \"What will we do with our boat?\" asked Katie Carson.    \"Oh, I can tow that,\" replied the youth.  \"Get right in and I'll take  you all around the lake.\"    \"Not too far,\" stipulated the girl who had figured in the runaway.  \"We  must be back for lunch, which will be served in about an hour.  Our  church and Sunday-school are having a picnic.\"    \"Maybe Mr. Swift will come and have some lunch with us,\" suggested Miss  Carson, blushing prettily.    \"Nothing would give me greater pleasure,\" answered Tom, and then he  laughed at his formal reply, the girls joining in.    \"We'd be glad to have you,\" added Miss Haddon.  \"Oh!\" she suddenly  screamed, \"the boat's tipping over!\"    \"Oh, no,\" Tom hastened to assure her, coming, to the side to help her  in.  \"It just tilts a bit, with the weight of so many on one side.  It  couldn't capsize if it tried.\"    In another moment the three were in the roomy cockpit and Tom had made  the empty rowboat fast to the stern.  He was about to start up when  from another boat, containing two little girls and two slightly larger  boys, came a plaintive cry:    \"Oh, mister, give us a ride!\"    \"Sure!\" agreed Tom pleasantly.  \"Just fasten your boat to the other  rowboat and I'll tow you.\"    One of the boys did this, and then, with three pretty girls as his  companions in the ARROW and towing the two boats, Tom started off.    The girls were very much interested in the craft and asked all sorts of  questions about how the engine operated.  Tom explained as clearly as  he could how the gasoline exploded in the cylinders, about the electric  spark and about the propeller.  Then, when he had finished, Miss Haddon  remarked naively:    \"Oh, Mr. Swift, you've explained it beautifully, and I'm sure if our  teacher in school made things as clear as you have that I could get  along fine.  I understand all about it, except I don't see what makes  the engine go.\"    \"Oh,\" said Tom faintly, and he wondering what would be the best remark  to make under the circumstances, when Miss Nestor created a diversion  by looking at her watch and exclaiming:    \"Oh, girls, it's lunch time!  We must go ashore.  Will you kindly put  about, Mr. Swift--I hope that is the proper term--and--land us--is that  right?\" and she looked archly at Tom.    \"That's perfectly right,\" he admitted with a laugh and a glance into  the girl's brown eyes.  \"I'll put you ashore at once,\" and he headed  for a small dock.    \"And come yourself to take lunch with us, added Miss Haddon.    \"I'm afraid I might be in the way,\" stammered Tom.  \"I--I have a pretty  good appetite, and--\"    \"I suppose you think that girls on a picnic don't take much lunch,\"  finished Miss Nestor.  \"But I assure you that we have plenty, and that  you will be very welcome,\" she added warmly.    \"Yes, and I'd like to have him explain over again how the engine  works,\" went on Miss Haddon.  \"I am so interested.\"    Tom helped the girls out, receiving their thanks as well as those of  the children in the second boat.  But as he walked with the young  ladies through the grove the young inventor registered a mental vow  that he would steer clear of explaining again how a gasoline engine  worked.    \"Now come right over this way to our table,\" invited Miss Nestor.  \"I  want you to meet papa and mamma.\"    Tom followed her.  As he stepped from behind a clump of trees he saw,  standing not far away, a figure that seemed strangely familiar.  A  moment later the figure turned and Tom saw Andy Foger confronting him.  At the sight of our hero the bully turned red and walked quickly away,  while Tom's fingers touched the ring of keys in his pocket.          CHAPTER VII    A BRUSH WITH ANDY      So unexpected was his encounter with Andy that the young inventor  hardly knew how to act, especially since he was a guest of the young  ladies.  Tom did not want to do or say anything to embarrass them or  make a scene, yet he did want to have a talk, and a very serious talk,  with Andy Foger.    Miss Nestor must have noticed Tom's sudden start at his glimpse of  Andy, for she asked: \"Did you see some one you knew, Mr. Swift?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Tom, \"I did--er--that is--\" He paused in some confusion.    \"Perhaps you'd like---that is prefer--to go with them instead of taking  lunch with girls who don't know anything about engines?\" she persisted.    \"Oh, no indeed,\" Tom hastened to assure her.  \"He--that is--the person  I saw wouldn't care to have me lunch with him,\" and the youth smiled  grimly.    \"Would you like to bring him over to our table?\" inquired Miss Carson.  \"We have plenty for him.\"    \"No, I think that would hardly do,\" continued the lad, who tried not to  smile at the picture of the red-haired and squint-eyed Andy Foger  making one of a party with the girls.  The young ladies fortunately had  not noticed the bully, who was out of view by this time.    Tom was presented to Mr. and Mrs. Nestor, who told him how glad they  were to meet the young man who had been instrumental in saving their  daughter from injury, if not death.  Tom was a bit embarrassed, but  bore the praise as well as he could, and he was very glad when a  diversion, in the shape of lunch, occurred.    After a meal on tables under the trees in the grove Tom took the girls  and some of their friends out in his motor-boat again.  They covered  several miles around the lake before returning to the picnic ground.    As Tom was starting toward home in his boat, wondering what had become  of Andy and trying to think of a reason why the bully should attend  anything as \"tame\" as a church picnic, the object of his thoughts came  strolling through the trees down to the shore of the lake.  The moment  he saw Tom the red-haired lad started back, but the young inventor,  leaping out of his boat, called out:    \"Hold on there, Andy Foger, I want to see you!\" and there was menace in  Tom's tone.    \"But, I don't want to see you!\" retorted the other sulkily.  \"I've got  no use for you.\"    \"No more have I for you,\" was Tom's quick reply.  \"But I want to return  you these keys.  You dropped them in my boat the other night when you  tried to set it afire."]]]
