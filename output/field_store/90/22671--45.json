It had long been known, that  the Queen deposits drone eggs in the large or drone cells, and worker  eggs in the small or worker cells, and that she makes no mistakes.  Dzierzon inferred, therefore, that there was some way in which she was  able to decide as to the sex of the egg before it was laid, and that she  must have a control over the mouth of the seminal sac, so as to be able  to extrude her eggs, allowing them to receive or not, just as she  pleased, a portion of its fertilizing contents. In this way he thought  she determined the sex, according to the size of the cells in which she  laid them. Mr. Samuel Wagner of York, Pa., has recently communicated to  me a very original and exceedingly ingenious theory of his own, which he  thinks will account for all the facts without admitting that the Queen  Bee has any special knowledge or will on the subject. He supposes that  when she deposits her eggs in the worker cells, her body is slightly  compressed by the size of the cells, and that the eggs, as they pass the  spermatheca, receive in this manner, its vivifying influence. On the  contrary, when she is egg-laying in drone cells, this compression cannot  take place, the mouth of the spermatheca is kept closed, and the eggs  are, necessarily, unfecundated. This theory may prove to be true, but at  present, it is encumbered with some difficulties and requires further  investigation, before it can be considered as fully established.    Leaving then the question whether the Queen exercises any volition in  this matter, for the present undecided, I shall state some facts which  occurred in the summer of 1852, in my own Apiary, and shall then  endeavor to relieve, as far as possible, this intricate subject from  some of the difficulties which embarrass it.    In the Autumn of 1852, my assistant found, in one of my hives, a young  Queen, the whole of whose progeny was drones. The colony had been formed  by removing part of the combs containing bees, brood and eggs from  another hive. It had only a few combs, and but a small number of bees.  They raised a new Queen in the manner which will hereafter be  particularly described. This Queen had laid a number of eggs in one of  the combs, and the young bees from some of them were already emerging  from the cells. I perceived, at the first glance, that they were drones.  As there were none but worker cells in the hive, they were reared in  them, and not having space for full development, they were dwarfed in  size, although the bees, in order to give them more room, had pieced out  the cells so as to make them larger than usual! Size excepted, they  appeared as perfect as any other drones.    I was not only struck with the singularity of finding drones reared in  worker cells, but with the equally singular fact that a young Queen, who  at first lays only the eggs of workers, should be laying drone eggs at  all; and at once conjectured that this was a case of a drone-laying,  unimpregnated Queen, as sufficient time had not elapsed for her  impregnation to be unnaturally retarded. I saw the great importance of  taking all necessary precautions to determine this point. The Queen was  removed from the hive, and carefully examined. Her wings, although they  appeared to be perfect, were so paralized that she could not fly. It  seemed probable, therefore, that she had never been able to leave the  hive for impregnation.    To settle the question beyond the possibility of doubt, I submitted this  Queen to Dr. Joseph Leidy for microscopic examination. The following is  an extract from his report: \"The ovaries were filled with eggs; the  poison sac was full of fluid, and I took the whole of it into my mouth;  the poison produced a strong metallic taste, lasting for a considerable  time, and at first, it was pungent to the tip of the tongue. The  spermatheca was distended with a perfectly colorless, transparent,  viscid liquid, _without a trace of spermatozoa_.\"    This examination seems perfectly to sustain the theory of Dzierzon, and  to demonstrate that Queens do not need to be impregnated, in order to  lay the eggs of males.    I must confess that very considerable doubts rested on my mind, as to  the accuracy of Dzierzon's statements on this subject, and chiefly  because of his having hazarded the unfortunate conjecture that the place  of the poison bag in the worker, is occupied in the Queen, by the  spermatheca. Now this is so completely contrary to fact, that it was a  very natural inference that this acute and thoroughly honest observer,  made no microscopic dissections of the insects which he examined. I  consider myself peculiarly fortunate in having enjoyed the benefit of  the labors of a Naturalist, so celebrated as Dr. Leidy, for microscopic  dissections. The exceeding minuteness of some of the insects which he  has completely figured and described, almost passes belief.    On examining this same colony a few days later, I obtained the most  satisfactory evidence that these drone eggs were laid by the Queen which  had been removed. No fresh eggs had been deposited in the cells, and the  bees, on missing her, had commenced the construction of royal cells, to  rear if possible, another Queen, a thing which they would not have done,  if a fertile worker had been present, by which the drone eggs had been  laid.    Another very interesting fact proves that _all_ the eggs laid by this  Queen, were drone eggs. Two of the royal cells were, in a short time,  discontinued, and were found to be empty, while a third contained a  worm, which was sealed over the usual way, to undergo its changes from a  worm to a perfect Queen.    I was completely at a loss to account for this, as the bees having an  unimpregnated drone-laying Queen, ought not to have had a single female  egg from which they could rear a Queen.    At first I imagined that they might have _stolen_ it from another hive,  but when I opened this cell, it contained, instead of a queen, _a dead  drone_!    I then remembered that Huber has described the same mistake on the part  of some of his bees. At the base of this cell, was an extraordinary  quantity of the peculiar jelly or paste, which is fed to the young that  are to be transformed into queens. The poor bees in their desperation,  appear to have dosed the unfortunate drone to death: as though they  expected by such liberal feeding, to produce some hopeful change in his  sexual organization!    It appears to me that these facts constitute all the links in a perfect  chain, and demonstrate beyond the possibility of doubt, that  unfecundated queens are not only capable of laying eggs, (this would be  no more remarkable than the same occurrence in a hen,) but that these  eggs are possessed of sufficient vitality to produce drones. Aristotle,  who flourished before the Christian era, had noticed that there was no  difference in appearance, between the eggs producing drones and those  producing workers; and he states that drones only are produced in hives  which have no queen; of course the eggs producing them, were laid by  fertile workers. Having now the aid of powerful microscopes, we are  still unable to detect the slightest difference in size or appearance in  the eggs, and this is precisely what we should expect if the same egg  will produce either a worker or a drone, according as it is or is not  impregnated. The theory which I propose, will, I think, perfectly  harmonize with all the observed facts on this subject.    I believe that after fecundation has been delayed for about three weeks,  the mouth of the spermatheca becomes permanently closed, so that  impregnation can no longer be effected; just as the parts of a flower,  after a certain time, wither and shut up, and the plant is incapable of  fructification. The fertile drone-laying workers, are in my opinion,  physically incapable of being impregnated. However strange it may  appear, or even improbable, that an unimpregnated egg can give birth to  a living being, or that the sex can be dependent on impregnation, we are  not at liberty to reject facts, because we cannot comprehend the reasons  of them. He who allows himself to be guilty of such folly, if he seeks  to maintain his consistency, will be plunged, sooner or later, into the  dreary gulf of atheism. Common sense, philosophy and religion alike  teach us to receive all undoubted facts in the natural and the  spiritual world, with becoming reverence; assured that however  mysterious to us, they are all most beautifully harmonious and  consistent in the sight of Him whose \"understanding is infinite.\"    There is something analogous to these wonders in the bee, in what takes  place in the aphides or green lice which infest our rose bushes and  other plants. We have the most undoubted evidence that a fecundated  female gives birth to other females, and they in turn to others still,  all of which, without impregnation, are able to bring forth young, until  at length, after a number of generations, perfect males and females are  produced, and the series starts anew!    The unequaled facilities, furnished by my hives, have seemed to render  it peculiarly incumbent on me, to do all in my power to clear up the  difficulties in this intricate and yet highly important branch of  Apiarian knowledge. All the leading facts in the breeding of bees ought  to be as well known to the bee keeper, as the same class of facts in the  rearing of his domestic animals. A few crude and hasty notions, but half  understood and half digested, will answer only for the old fashioned bee  keeper, who deals in the brimstone matches. He who expects to conduct  bee keeping on a safe and profitable system, must learn that on this, as  on all other subjects, \"knowledge is power.\"    The extraordinary fertility of the queen bee has already been noticed.

The foregoing sketch of my early life may be properly followed by  extracts from my diary; pourtraying my mental and spiritual exercises  and labours during a few months before and after I commenced the work of  an itinerant Methodist Preacher.    The extracts are as follow, and are very brief in comparison to the  entire diary, which extends over eight years from 1824, to 1832, after  which time I ceased to write a daily diary, and wrote in a journal the  principal occurrences and doings in which I was concerned.[3]         _Hamilton, August 12th, 1824._--I arrived here the day after I left       home. Mr. John Law (with whom I am to study) received me with all       the affection and kindness of a sincere and disinterested friend.       Even, without expecting it, he told me that his library was at my       service; that he did not wish me to join any class, but to read by       myself, that he might pay every attention, and give me every       assistance in his power. Indeed he answered my highest expectation.       I am stopping with Mr. John Aikman. He is one of the most       respectable men in this vicinity. I shall be altogether retired. At       the Court of Assize, the Chief-Justice and the Attorney-General       will stop here, which will make a very agreeable change for a few       days. To pursue my studies with indefatigable industry, and ardent       zeal, will be my set purpose, so that I may never have to mourn the       loss of my precious time.         _Aug. 16th._--This day I commenced my studies by reading Latin and       Greek with Mr. Law. I began the duties of the day in imploring the       assistance of God; for without Him I cannot do anything. God has       been pleased to open my understanding, to enlighten my mind, and to       show me the necessity and blessedness of an unreserved and habitual       devotion to his heavenly will. I have heard Bishop Hedding preach,       also Rev. Nathan Bangs. I am resolved to improve my time more       diligently, and to give myself wholly to God. Oh, may his       long-suffering mercy bear with me, his wisdom guide, his power       support and defend me, and may his mercy bring me off triumphant in       the dying day!         _Aug. 17th._--I have been reading Virgil's Georgics. I find them       very difficult, and have only read seventy lines. In my spiritual       concerns I have been greatly blessed; and felt more anxiously       concerned for my soul's salvation, have prayed more than usual, and       experienced a firmer confidence in the blessed promises of the       Gospel. I have enjoyed sweet intercourse with my Saviour, my soul       resting on his divine word, with a prayerful acquiescence in his       dispensations. But alas! what evil have I done, how much time have       I lost, how many idle words have I spoken; how should these       considerations lead me to watch my thoughts, to husband my time       with judgment, and govern my tongue as with a bridle! Oh, Lord       bless me and prosper me in all my ways and labours, and keep me to       thyself!         _Aug. 18th._--The Lord has abundantly blessed me this day both in       my spiritual and classical pursuits. I have been able to pursue my       studies with facility, and have felt his Holy Spirit graciously       enlightening my mind, showing me the necessity of separating myself       from the world, and being given up entirely to his service.         _Aug. 19th._--I have this day proved that, with every temptation,       the Lord makes a way for my escape. I have enjoyed much peace. Oh,       Lord, help me to improve my precious time, so as to overcome the       assaults and escape the snares of the adversary!         _Aug. 20th._--In all the vicissitudes of life, how clearly is the       mysterious providence and superintending care of Jehovah       manifested! how strikingly can I observe the divine interposition       of my heavenly Father, and how sensibly do I realize his       benevolence, kindness, and mercy in the whole moral and blessed       economy of his equitable and infinitely wise government! On no       object do I cast my eyes without observing an affecting instance of       a benevolent and overruling power; and, while in mental       contemplations my mind is absorbed, my admiration rises still       higher to the exalted purposes and designs of Almighty God. I       behold in the soul noble faculties, superior powers of imagination,       and capacious desires, unfilled by anything terrestrial, and wishes       unsatisfied by the widest grasp of human ambition. What is this but       immortality? Oh, that my soul may feed on food immortal!         Another week is gone, eternally gone! What account can I give to my       Almighty Judge for my conduct and opportunities? Has my improvement       kept pace with the panting steeds of unretarded time? Must I give       an account of every idle word, thought, and deed? Oh, merciful God!       if the most righteous, devoted, and holy scarcely are saved, where       stall I appear? How do my vain thoughts, and unprofitable       conversation, swell heaven's register? Where is my watchfulness!       Where are my humility, purity, and hatred of sin? Where is my zeal?       Alas! alas! they are things unpractised, unfelt, almost unknown to       me. How little do I share in the toils, the labours, or the sorrows       of the righteous, and consequently how little do I participate in       their confidence, their joys, their heavenly prospects? Oh, may       these awful considerations drive me closer to God, and incite to a       more diligent improvement of my precious time, so that I may bear       the mark of a real follower of Christ!         _Aug. 22nd.--Sabbath._--When I arose this morning I endeavoured to       dedicate myself afresh to God in prayer, with a full determination       to improve the day to his glory, and to spend it in his service.       Accordingly, I spent the morning in prayer, reading, and       meditation; but when I came to mingle with the worldly-minded, my       devotions and meditations were dampened and distracted, my thoughts       unprofitable and vain. I attended a Methodist Class-meeting where I       felt myself forcibly convinced of my shortcomings. Sure I am that       unless I am more vigilant, zealous, and watchful, I shall never       reach the Paradise of God. I must be willing to bear reproach for       Christ's sake, confess him before men, or I never can be owned by       him in the presence of his Father, and the holy angels.         Merciful God! forbid that I should barter away my heavenly       inheritance for a transient gleam of momentary joy, and the empty       round of worldly pleasure:           \"Help me to watch and pray,           And on thyself rely,         Assured if I my trust betray,           I shall forever die.\"         _Aug. 23rd._--I have been abundantly prospered in my studies       to-day; and have been enabled to maintain an outward conformity in       my conduct. But alas! how blind to my own interest, to deprive       myself of the highest blessings and exalted honours the Almighty       has to bestow. Oh, Lord! help me henceforth to be wise unto       salvation. May I be sober and watch unto prayer! Amen.         _Aug. 24th._--Through the mercy of God I have been enabled in a       good degree to overcome my besetments, and have this day maintained       more consistency in conversation and conduct. Still I feel too much       deterred by the fear of man, and thirst too ardently for the       honours of the world. Merciful God! give me more grace, wisdom, and       strength, that I may triumphantly overcome and escape to heaven at       last!         I shall finish the first book of the Georgics to-day, which is the       seventh day since I commenced them. I expect to finish them in four       weeks from this time. My mind improves, and I feel much encouraged.       My labour is uniform and constant, from the dawn of day till near       eleven at night. I have not a moment to play on the flute.         _Aug. 25th._--There is nothing like implicit trust in the Almighty       for assistance, protection, and assurance! His past dispensations       and dealings with me leave not the least suspicion of his       inviolable veracity, and his efficacious promises cheer the       sadness, calm the fears of every soul that practically reposes in       and seeks after him. The truth of this, blessed be God, I have in       some measure experienced to-day. Help me, O Lord, with increasing       grace to attain still more sublime enjoyments and triumphant       prospects!         _Aug. 26th._--I feel a growing indifference to worldly pleasures,       and increasing love to God, to holiness, and heaven. Entire       confidence in a superintending Providence heals the wounded heart       of even the disconsolate widow, and gives the oil of joy for       sorrow, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.         _Aug. 27th._--This day I attended a funeral; those connected with       it were very ignorant; how strikingly this showed to me the       advantages of a good education. God forbid that I should idle away     "]]]
