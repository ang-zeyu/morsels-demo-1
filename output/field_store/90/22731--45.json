The Italians  are a most unpleasant people. They pry everywhere, they see everything,  and they know what we want before we know it ourselves. We are at their  mercy. They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires. From the  cab-driver down to--to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent  it. Yet in their heart of hearts they are--how superficial! They have no  conception of the intellectual life. How right is Signora Bertolini, who  exclaimed to me the other day: 'Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I suffer  over the children's edjucaishion. HI won't 'ave my little Victorier  taught by a hignorant Italian what can't explain nothink!'\"    Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an  agreeable way. Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe, having  expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who  wore a pair of russet whiskers. Indeed, who would have supposed that  tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant  form?    In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last  the cause was disclosed. From the chair beneath her she extracted  a gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the  initials \"E. L.\"    \"That belongs to Lavish.\" said the clergyman. \"A good fellow, Lavish,  but I wish she'd start a pipe.\"    \"Oh, Mr. Beebe,\" said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth. \"Indeed,  though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as  you suppose. She took to it, practically in despair, after her  life's work was carried away in a landslip. Surely that makes it more  excusable.\"    \"What was that?\" asked Lucy.    Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: \"It was  a novel--and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice novel.  It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I must say  they nearly always do. Anyhow, she left it almost finished in the Grotto  of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a  little ink. She said: 'Can I have a little ink, please?' But you know  what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the  beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she  has written. The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted  into cigarettes. It is a great secret, but I am glad to say that she is  writing another novel. She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that  she had got up all the local colour--this novel is to be about modern  Italy; the other was historical--but that she could not start till she  had an idea. First she tried Perugia for an inspiration, then she came  here--this must on no account get round. And so cheerful through it all!  I cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone,  even if you do not approve of them.\"    Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement.  A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving them  unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes  rise odours reminiscent of spring. She felt she had made almost too many  allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her toleration.    \"All the same, she is a little too--I hardly like to say unwomanly, but  she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.\"    Mr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she  would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.    \"I don't know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole, the  lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade. That old Mr. Emerson,  who puts things very strangely--\"    Her jaw dropped. She was silent. Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were  endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a  hasty whisper:    \"Stomach. He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it--and  he may have meant to be kind. I must say I forgot myself and laughed; it  was so sudden. As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter. But the  point is that Miss Lavish was positively ATTRACTED by his mentioning  S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different grades of  thought. She thought they were commercial travellers--'drummers' was the  word she used--and all through dinner she tried to prove that England,  our great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce. Teresa was  very much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she  did so: 'There, Miss Lavish, is one who can confute you better than I,'  and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson. Then Miss  Lavish said: 'Tut! The early Victorians.' Just imagine! 'Tut! The early  Victorians.' My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak. I said:  'Miss Lavish, I am an early Victorian; at least, that is to say, I  will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen.' It was horrible  speaking. I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did  not want to go, and I must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.  But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his deep  voice: 'Quite so, quite so! I honour the woman for her Irish visit.' The  woman! I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in  by this time, all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first  place. But that was not all. After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up  and said: 'Miss Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those  two nice men. Come, too.' Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable  invitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would  broaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all University  men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking  to commercial travellers.\"    \"Let me finish the story,\" said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.    \"Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said:  'I shall go alone.' She went. At the end of five minutes she returned  unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.\"    \"Whatever happened?\" cried Lucy.    \"No one knows. No one will ever know. Miss Lavish will never dare to  tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.\"    \"Mr. Beebe--old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice? I do so want to  know.\"    Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for  herself.    \"No; but it is so difficult. Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do not  mind him. Miss Alan, what do you think? Is he nice?\"    The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly. Mr.  Beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying:    \"I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after  that business of the violets.\"    \"Violets? Oh, dear! Who told you about the violets? How do things get  round? A pension is a bad place for gossips. No, I cannot forget how  they behaved at Mr. Eager's lecture at Santa Croce. Oh, poor Miss  Honeychurch! It really was too bad. No, I have quite changed. I do NOT  like the Emersons. They are not nice.\"    Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly. He had made a gentle effort to introduce  the Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed. He was  almost the only person who remained friendly to them. Miss Lavish, who  represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans,  who stood for good breeding, were following her. Miss Bartlett, smarting  under an obligation, would scarcely be civil. The case of Lucy was  different. She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in Santa  Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly  concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from their own  strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows and joys.  This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be championed by a  young girl: he would rather it should fail. After all, he knew nothing  about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are flimsy things;  whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.    Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the  Emersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now. Even their  seats at dinner had been moved.    \"But aren't they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?\" said  the little lady inquisitively.    \"Only once. Charlotte didn't like it, and said something--quite  politely, of course.\"    \"Most right of her. They don't understand our ways. They must find their  level.\"    Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under. They had given up their  attempt--if it was one--to conquer society, and now the father was  almost as silent as the son. He wondered whether he would not plan a  pleasant day for these folk before they left--some expedition, perhaps,  with Lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them. It was one of Mr. Beebe's  chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories.    Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the  colours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its  muddy solidity and began to twinkle. There were a few streaks of  bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the  earth, and then the dripping facade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in  the declining sun.    \"Too late to go out,\" said Miss Alan in a voice of relief. \"All the  galleries are shut.\"    \"I think I shall go out,\" said Lucy. \"I want to go round the town in the  circular tram--on the platform by the driver.\"    Her two companions looked grave. Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for her  in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say:    \"I wish we could. Unluckily I have letters. If you do want to go out  alone, won't you be better on your feet?\"    \"Italians, dear, you "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26457"],[0,"New observations on the natural history of bees (#7)"],[1,"queens were imprisoned thirty days;  and being then set at liberty, they departed, and returned impregnated.  Visiting the hives in the beginning of July, I found much brood, but  wholly consisting of the worms and nymphs of males. There actually was  not a single worker's worm or nymph. Both queens laid uninterruptedly  until autumn, and constantly the eggs of drones. Their laying ended in  the first week of November, as that of my other queens.    I was very earnest to learn what would become of them in the subsequent  spring, whether they would resume laying, or if new fecundation would be  necessary; and if they did lay, of what species the eggs would be.  However, the hives being very weak, I dreaded they might perish during  winter. Fortunately, we were able to preserve them; and from April 1790,  they recommenced laying. The precautions we had taken prevented them  from receiving any new approaches of the male. Their eggs were still  those of males.    It would have been extremely interesting to have followed the history of  these two females still farther, but, to my great regret, the workers  abandoned their hives on the fourth of May, and that same day I found  both queens dead. No weevils were in the hive, which could disturb the  bees; and the honey was still very plentiful: but as no workers had been  been produced in the course of the preceding year, and winter had  destroyed many, they were too few in spring to engage in their wonted  labours, and, from discouragement, deserted their habitation to occupy  the neighbouring hives.    In my Journal, I find a detail of many experiments on the retarded  impregnation of queen bees, so many, that transcribing the whole would  be tedious. I may repeat, however, that there was not the least  variation in the principle, and that whenever the copulation of queens  was postponed beyond the twenty-first day, the eggs of males only were  produced. Therefore, I shall limit my narrative to those experiments  that have taught me some remarkable facts.    A queen being hatched on the fourth of October 1789, we put her into a  leaf-hive. Though the season was well advanced, a considerable number of  males was still in the hive; and it here became important to learn,  whether, at this period of the year, they could equally effect  fecundation; also, in case it succeeded, whether a laying, begun in the  middle of autumn, would be interrupted or continued during winter. Thus,  we allowed the queen to leave the hive. She departed, indeed, but made  four and twenty fruitless attempts before returning with the evidence of  fecundation. Finally, on the thirty-first of October, she was more  fortunate: She departed, and returned with the most undoubted proof of  the success of her amours: She was now twenty-seven days old,  consequently fecundation had been retarded. She ought to have begun  laying within forty-six hours, but the weather was cold, and she did not  lay; which proves, as we may cursorily remark, that refrigeration of the  atmosphere is the principal agent that suspends the laying of queens  during winter. I was excessively impatient to learn whether, on the  return of spring, she would prove fertile, without a new copulation. The  means of ascertaining the fact was easy; for the entrances of the hives  only required contraction, so as to prevent her from escaping. She was  confined from the end of October until May. In the middle of March, we  visited the combs, and found a considerable number of eggs, but, none  being yet hatched, we could not know whether they would produce workers  or males. On the fourth of April, having again examined the state of the  hive, we found a prodigious quantity of nymphs and worms, all of  drones; nor had this queen laid a single worker's egg.    Here, as well as in the preceding experiment, retardation had rendered  the queens incapable of laying the eggs of workers. But this result is  the more remarkable, as the queen did not commence laying until four  months and a half after fecundation. It is not rigorously true,  therefore, that the term of forty-six hours elapses between the  copulation of the female and her laying; the interval may be much  longer, if the weather grows cold. Lastly, it follows, that although  cold will retard the laying of a queen impregnated in autumn, she will  begin to lay in spring without requiring new copulation.    It may be added, that the fecundity of the queen, whose history is given  here, was astonishing. On the first of May, we found in her hive,  besides six hundred males, already flies, two thousand four hundred and  thirty-eight cells, containing either eggs or nymphs of drones. Thus,  she had laid more than three thousand male eggs during March and April,  which is above fifty each day. Her death soon afterwards unfortunately  interrupted my observation, I intended to calculate the total number of  male eggs that she should lay throughout the year, and compare it with  those of queens whose fecundation had not been retarded. You know, Sir,  that the latter lay about two thousand male eggs in spring; and another  laying, but less considerable, commences in August, also in the  interval, that they produce the eggs of workers almost solely. But it is  otherwise with the females whose copulation has been retarded: they  produce no workers' eggs. For four or five months following, they lay  the eggs of males without interruption, and in such numbers, that, in  this short time, I suppose one queen gives birth to more drones than a  female, whose fecundation has not been retarded, produces in the course  of two years. It gives me much regret, that I have not been able to  verify this conjecture.    I should also describe the very remarkable manner in which queens, that  lay only the eggs of drones, sometimes deposit them in the cells.  Instead of being placed in the lozenges forming the bottom, they are  frequently deposited on the lower side of the cells, two lines from the  mouth. This arises from the body of such queens being shorter than that  of those whose fecundation has not been retarded. The extremity remains  slender, while the first two rings next the thorax are uncommonly swoln.  Thus, in disposing themselves for laying, the extremity cannot reach the  bottom of the cells on account of the swoln rings; consequently the eggs  must remain attached to the part that the extremity reaches. The worms  proceeding from them pass their vermicular state in the same place where  the eggs were deposited, which proves that bees are not charged with the  care of transporting the eggs as has been supposed. But here they  follow another plan. They extend beyond the surface of the comb those  cells where they observe the eggs deposited, two lines from the mouth.    Permit me, Sir, to digress a moment from the subject, to give the result  of an experiment which seems interesting. Bees, I say, are not charged  with the care of transporting into cells, the eggs misplaced by the  queen: and, judging by the single instance I have related, you will  think me well entitled to deny this feature of their industry. However,  as several authors have maintained the reverse, and even demanded our  admiration of them in conveying the eggs, I should explain clearly that  they are deceived.    I had a glass hive constructed of two stages; the higher was filled with  combs of large cells, and the lower with those of common ones. A kind of  division, or diaphraghm, separated these two stages from  each other, having at each side an opening for the passage of the  workers from one stage to the other, but too narrow for the queen. I  put a considerable number of bees into this hive; and, in the upper  part, confined a very fertile queen that had just finished her great  laying of male eggs; therefore she had only those of workers to lay, and  she was obliged to deposit them in the surrounding large cells from the  want of others. My object in this arrangement will already be  anticipated. My reasoning was simple. If the queen laid workers' eggs in  the large cells, and the bees were charged with transporting them if  misplaced, they would infallibly take advantage of the liberty allowed  to pass from either stage: they would seek the eggs deposited in the  large cells, and carry them down to the lower stage containing the cells  adapted for that species. If, on the contrary, they left the common eggs  in the large cells, I should obtain certain proof that they had not the  charge of transporting them.    The result of this experiment excited my curiosity extremely. We  observed the queen several days without intermission. During the first  twenty-four hours, she persisted in not laying a single egg in the  surrounding cells; she examined them one after another, but passed on  without insinuating her belly into one. She was restless, and traversed  the combs in all directions: her eggs appeared an oppressive burden, but  she persisted in retaining them rather than they should be deposited in  cells of unsuitable diameter. The bees, however, did not cease to pay  her homage, and treat her as a mother. I was amused to observe, when she  approached the edges of the division separating the two stages, that she  gnawed at them to enlarge the passage: the workers approached her, and  also laboured with their teeth, and made every exertion to enlarge the  entrance to her prison, but ineffectually. On the second day, the queen  could no longer retain her eggs: they escaped in spite of her, and fell  at random. Then we conceived that the bees would convey them into the  small cells of the lower stage, and we sought them there with the utmost  assiduity; but I can safely affirm there was not one. The eggs that the  queen still laid the third day disappeared as the first. We again sought  them in the small cells, but none were there. The fact is, they are ate  by the workers; and this is what has deceived the naturalists, "]]]
