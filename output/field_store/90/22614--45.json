[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22925"],[0,"The Story of Young Abraham Lincoln (#7)"],[1,"    Dennis Hanks told afterward of the great difference the stepmother made  in their young lives:    \"In fact, in a few weeks all had changed; and where everything had been  wanting, all was snug and comfortable. She was a woman of great energy,  of remarkable good sense, very industrious and saving, also very neat  and tidy in her person and manners. She took an especial liking for  young Abe. Her love for him was warmly returned, and continued to the  day of his death. But few children love their parents as he loved his  stepmother. She dressed him up in entire new clothes, and from that time  on he appeared to lead a new life. He was encouraged by her to study,  and a wish on his part was gratified when it could be done. The two sets  of children got along finely together, as if they all had been the  children of the same parents.\"    Dennis also referred to the \"large supply of household goods\" the new  mother brought with her:    \"One fine bureau (worth $40), one table, one set of chairs, one large  clothes chest, cooking utensils, knives, forks, bedding and other  articles.\"    It must have been a glorious day when such a splendid array of household  furniture was carried into the rude cabin of Thomas Lincoln. But best of  all, the new wife had sufficient tact and force of will to induce her  good-hearted but shiftless husband to lay a floor, put in a window, and  hang a door to protect his doubled family from the cold. It was about  Christmas time, and the Lincoln children, as they nestled in warm beds  for the first time in their lives, must have thanked their second mother  from the bottoms of their grateful hearts.          CHAPTER VI    SCHOOL DAYS NOW AND THEN      Lincoln once wrote, in a letter to a friend, about his early teachers in  Indiana:    \"He (father) removed from Kentucky to what is now Spencer County,  Indiana, in my eighth year. We reached our new home about the time the  State came into the Union. It was a wild region with many bears and  other wild animals still in the woods. There I grew up. There were some  schools, so-called; but no qualification was ever required of a teacher  beside readin', writin', and cipherin' to the Rule of Three (simple  proportion). If a straggler supposed to understand Latin happened to  sojourn in the neighborhood, he was looked upon as a wizard. There was  absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education.\"    Abe's first teacher in Indiana, however, was Hazel Dorsey. The school  house was built of rough, round logs. The chimney was made of poles well  covered with clay. The windows were spaces cut in the logs, and covered  with greased paper. But Abe was determined to learn. He and his sister  thought nothing of walking four miles a day through snow, rain and mud.  \"Nat\" Grigsby, who afterward married the sister, spoke in glowing terms  of Abe's few school days:    \"He was always at school early, and attended to his studies. He lost no  time at home, and when not at work was at his books. He kept up his  studies on Sunday, and carried his books with him to work, so that he  might read when he rested from labor.\"    Thomas Lincoln had no use for \"eddication,\" as he called it. \"It will  spile the boy,\" he kept saying. He--the father--had got along better  without going to school, and why should Abe have a better education than  his father? He thought Abe's studious habits were due to \"pure laziness,  jest to git shet o' workin'.\" So, whenever there was the slightest  excuse, he took Abe out of school and set him to work at home or for one  of the neighbors, while he himself went hunting or loafed about the  house.    This must have been very trying to a boy as hungry to learn as Abe  Lincoln was. His new mother saw and sympathized with him, and in her  quiet way, managed to get the boy started to school, for a few weeks at  most. For some reason Hazel Dorsey stopped \"keeping\" the school, and  there was a long \"vacation\" for all the children. But a new man, Andrew  Crawford, came and settled near Gentryville. Having nothing better to do  at first, he was urged to reopen the school.    One evening Abe came in from his work and his stepmother greeted him  with:    \"Another chance for you to go to school.\"    \"Where?\"    \"That man Crawford that moved in a while ago is to begin school next  week, and two miles and back every day will be just about enough for you  to walk to keep your legs limber.\"    The tactful wife accomplished it somehow and Abe started off to school  with Nancy, and a light heart. A neighbor described him as he appeared  in Crawford's school, as \"long, wiry and strong, while his big feet and  hands, and the length of his legs and arms, were out of all proportion  to his small trunk and head. His complexion was swarthy, and his skin  shriveled and yellow even then. He wore low shoes, buckskin breeches,  linsey-woolsey shirt, and a coonskin cap. The breeches hung close to his  legs, but were far from meeting the tops of his shoes, exposing 'twelve  inches of shinbone, sharp, blue and narrow.'\"    \"Yet,\" said Nat Grigsby, \"he was always in good health, never sick, and  had an excellent constitution.\"      HELPING KATE ROBY SPELL    Andrew Crawford must have been an unusual man, for he tried to teach  \"manners\" in his backwoods school! Spelling was considered a great  accomplishment. Abe shone as a speller in school and at the  spelling-matches. One day, evidently during a period when young Lincoln  was kept from school to do some outside work for his father, he appeared  at the window when the class in spelling was on the floor. The word  \"defied\" was given out and several pupils had misspelled it. Kate Roby,  the pretty girl of the village, was stammering over it. \"D-e-f,\" said  Kate, then she hesitated over the next letter. Abe pointed to his eye  and winked significantly. The girl took the hint and went on glibly  \"i-e-d,\" and \"went up head.\"      \"I DID IT!\"    There was a buck's head nailed over the school house door. It proved a  temptation to young Lincoln, who was tall enough to reach it easily. One  day the schoolmaster discovered that one horn was broken and he demanded  to know who had done the damage. There was silence and a general denial  till Abe spoke up sturdily:    \"I did it. I did not mean to do it, but I hung on it--and it broke!\"  The other boys thought Abe was foolish to \"own up\" till he had to--but  that was his way.    It is doubtful if Abe Lincoln owned an arithmetic. He had a copybook,  made by himself, in which he entered tables of weights and measures and  \"sums\" he had to do. Among these was a specimen of schoolboy doggerel:            \"Abraham Lincoln,             His hand and pen,           He will be good--             But God knows when!\"    In another place he wrote some solemn reflections on the value of time:            \"Time, what an empty vapor 'tis,             And days, how swift they are!           Swift as an Indian arrow--             Fly on like a shooting star.           The present moment, just, is here,             Then slides away in haste,           That we can never say they're ours,             But only say they're past.\"    As he grew older his handwriting improved and he was often asked to \"set  copies\" for other boys to follow. In the book of a boy named  Richardson, he wrote this prophetic couplet:            \"Good boys who to their books apply           Will all be great men by and by.\"      A \"MOTHER'S BOY\"--HIS FOOD AND CLOTHING    Dennis Hanks related of his young companion: \"As far as food and  clothing were concerned, the boy had plenty--such as it  was--'corndodgers,' bacon and game, some fish and wild fruits. We had  very little wheat flour. The nearest mill was eighteen miles. A hoss  mill it was, with a plug (old horse) pullin' a beam around; and Abe used  to say his dog could stand and eat the flour as fast as it was made,  _and then be ready for supper_!    \"For clothing he had jeans. He was grown before he wore all-wool pants.  It was a new country, and he was a raw boy, rather a bright and likely  lad; but the big world seemed far ahead of him. We were all slow-goin'  folks. But he had the stuff of greatness in him. He got his rare sense  and sterling principles from both parents. But Abe's kindliness, humor,  love of humanity, hatred of slavery, all came from his mother. I am  free to say Abe was a 'mother's boy.'\"    Dennis used to like to tell of Abe's earliest ventures in the fields of  literature: \"His first readin' book was Webster's speller. Then he got  hold of a book--I can't rickilect the name. It told about a feller, a  nigger or suthin', that sailed a flatboat up to a rock, and the rock was  magnetized and drawed the nails out of his boat, an' he got a duckin',  or drownded, or suthin', I forget now. (This book, of course, was 'The  Arabian Nights.') Abe would lay on the floor with a chair under his  head, and laugh over them stories by the hour. I told him they was  likely lies from end to end; but he learned to read right well in them.\"    His stock of books was small, but they were the right kind--the Bible,  \"The Pilgrim's Progress,\" AEsop's Fables, \"Robinson Crusoe,\" a history of  the United States, and the Statutes of Indiana. This last was a strange  book for a boy to read, but Abe pored over it as eagerly as a lad to-day  might read \"The Three Guardsmen,\" or \"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\" He  made notes of what he read with his turkey-buzzard pen and brier-root  ink. If he did not have these handy, he would write with a piece of  charcoal or the charred end of a stick, on a board, or on the under side  of a chair or bench. He used the wooden fire shovel for a slate, shaving  it off clean when both sides were full of figures. When he got hold of  paper enough to make a copy-book he would go about transferring his  notes from boards, beams, under sides of the chairs and the table, and  from all the queer places he had put them down, on the spur of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#7)"],[1,"Sidenote: THE CHANDALAR]    A new Indian guide had been engaged as far as Coldfoot, and we set  out--three men, two toboggans, and seven dogs; four on the larger  vehicle and three on the smaller, one of the dogs brought by our guide.  Three miles from Fort Yukon we crossed the Porcupine River and then  plunged into the wilderness of lake and swamp and forest that stretches  north of the Yukon. A portage trail, as such a track across country is  called to distinguish it from a river trail, has the advantage of such  protection from storm as its timbered stretches afford. For miles and  miles the route passes through scrub spruce that has been burned over,  with no prospect but a maze of charred poles against the snow, some  upright, others at every angle of inclination. Then comes a lake, with  difficulty in finding the trail on its wind-swept surface and sometimes  much casting about to discover where it leaves the lake again, and then  more small burned timber. Wherever the route is through woods, living or  dead, it is blazed; when it strikes the open, one is often at a loss.  After three or four days of such travel, sometimes reaching an old cabin  for the night, sometimes pitching the tent, one is rejoiced at the  sight of distant mountains and at the intimation they bring that the  inexpressible dreariness of the Yukon Flats is nearly past; and  presently the trail opens suddenly upon the broad Chandalar.    The Hudson Bay voyageurs are responsible for many names in this part of  Alaska, and Chandalar is a corruption of their \"Gens de large.\" The  various native tribes received appellations indicating habitats. A tribe  that differed from most northern Indians, in having no permanent  villages and in living altogether in encampments, was named \"Gens de  large,\" and the river which they frequented took their name.    It is one of the second-rate tributaries of the Yukon, and in general  its waters are swift and shallow, not navigable for light-draught  steamboats for more than one hundred and fifty miles, save at flood, and  not easily navigable at all. It is these swift shallow streams that are  so formidable in winter on account of overflow water, and the Chandalar  is one of the most dreaded.    [Sidenote: DIPHTHERIA]    Ten miles along the river's surface brought us to the Chandalar native  village, a settlement of half a dozen cabins and twenty-five or thirty  souls. The people came out to meet us, and said they were just about to  bury a baby, and asked me to conduct the funeral. Because we had not  done a day's march and were under compulsion to push on at our best  speed, I did not unlash the sled but went just as I was up the hill with  the sorrowful procession to the little graveyard. On the way down I  asked as best I could of what sickness the baby had died, and I felt  some uneasiness when the throat was pointed to as the seat of disease.  When, presently, I was informed that two others were sick, and of the  same complaint, my uneasiness became alarm. I went at once to see them,  and the angry swollen throats patched with white membrane which I  discovered left no room for doubt that we were in the presence of  another outbreak of diphtheria. That disease had scourged the Yukon in  the two preceding years. Twenty-three children died at Fort Yukon in the  summer of 1904, half a dozen at Circle in the following winter, though  that outbreak was grappled with from the first; and all along the river  the loss of life was terrible.    There was no question that we must give up all hope of reaching Bettles  for Christmas and stay and do what we could for these people. So we made  camp on the outskirts of the village, and I went to work swabbing out  the throats with carbolic acid and preparing liquid food from our grub  box. There was nothing to eat in the village but dried fish and a little  dried moose, and these throats like red-hot iron could hardly swallow  liquids. The two patients were a boy of sixteen and a grown woman. It  was evident that unless we could isolate them the disease would probably  pass through the whole village, and, indeed, others might have been  infected already. It was likely that we were in for a siege of it, and  our supply of condensed milk and extract of beef would soon be  exhausted. Moreover, at Fort Yukon was the trained nurse who had coped  with the epidemic there and at Circle, while we had virtually no  experience with the disease at all. It was resolved to send back to Fort  Yukon for supplies and for the nurse.    The next morning Mr. Knapp and the native boy took the dogs and the sled  and started back. With no load save a little grub and bedding, they  could make the journey in two days, a day must be allowed for  preparations, and, with the aid of another dog team, two days more would  bring them back. Five days was the least they could be gone. It was  asking a great deal of this lady to abandon her Christmas festival,  preparations for which had long been making, and to come sixty-five  miles through the frozen wilderness in a toboggan; but I felt sure she  would drop everything and come.    For those five days I was busied in close attention to the patients and  in strenuous though not altogether availing efforts to maintain a  quarantine of the cabin in which they lay. There was little more that I  could do than swab out the throats and administer food every two hours.  As the disease advanced it was increasingly painful to swallow and  exceedingly difficult to induce the sufferers to make the attempt or to  open their mouths for the swabbing. After two or three days the woman  seemed to have passed the crisis of the disease and to be mending, but  the boy, I thought, grew worse. One becomes attached to those to whom  one ministers, and this poor, speechless boy, with his terrible throat  and the agony in his big black eyes, appealed to me very strongly  indeed. It was torture to move his head or to open his mouth, and I had  to torture him continually.    Every night I gathered the people for Divine service. Here was a little  community far off in the wilds that had carefully conserved and handed  on to their children the teaching they had received no less than thirty  years before. The native Bibles and prayer-books and hymnals were  brought out, bearing dates of publication in the seventies; one of their  number acted as leader, and what he read was painfully followed in the  well-thumbed books. They lifted their voices in a weird transformation  of familiar tunes, with quavers and glides that had crept in through  long, uncorrected use, and amongst the prayers said was one for \"Our  Sovereign lady Queen Victoria, and Albert Edward, Prince of Wales.\" I  tried to explain that Queen Victoria was dead, that they were not living  under British rule, and I took a pencil and struck out the prayers for  the royal family from the books. But there was doubt in their minds and  a reluctance to alter in any particular the liturgy that had been taught  them, and it is quite likely that intercessions for a defunct sovereign  of another land still arise from the Chandalar village. One cannot but  feel a deep admiration for the pioneer missionaries of this  region--Bishop Bompas, Archdeacon MacDonald, and the others--whose  teaching was so thorough and so lasting, and who lived and laboured here  long before any gold seeker had thought of Alaska, when the country was  an Indian country exclusively, with none of the comforts and  conveniences that can now be enjoyed. It was to a remote cabin on the  East Fork of this river that Archdeacon MacDonald retired for a year to  make part of his translation of the Bible, according to the Indian  account.    [Sidenote: THE SHORTEST DAY]    At noon on the 21st of December, the shortest day, there is a note in my  diary that I saw the sun's disk shining through the trees. Although  fully half a degree of latitude north of the Arctic Circle, the  refraction is sufficient to lift his whole sphere above the horizon. One  speculates how much farther north it would be possible to see any part  of the sun at noon on the shortest day; but north of here, throughout  Alaska, is broken and mountainous country. We were on the northern edge  of the great flat of the interior.    The fifth day at the village was Christmas Eve. My boy was in a critical  condition, very low and weak, with a temperature that stayed around 101 deg.  and 102 deg.. As night approached I watched with the greatest anxiety for  the party from Fort Yukon, and, just as the last lingering glow of the  long twilight was fading from the south, there was a distant tinkle of  bells on the trail, and faintly once and again a man's voice was raised  in command and I knew that relief was at hand.    The nurse had dropped everything and had come, as I felt sure she would.  Gathering medicines and supplies and hiring a native dog team and  driver, she had left immediately, and the round trip had been made in  the shortest time it was possible to make it. It was a tremendous relief  to see her step out of the rugs and robes of the toboggan and take  charge of the situation in her quiet, competent way. A small, outlying  cabin was selected for a hospital, the family that occupied it bundled  out into a tent, and the two sick persons carefully moved into it, with  whom and the mother of the sick boy the nurse took up her abode. Then  there was the Christmas-tree in the chief's cabin, with little gifts for  the children sent out from the mission at Fort Yukon some time before,  and a dance afterward, for Christmas festivities must go on, whatever  happens, at a native village. I took James's pocket-knife to him after  the celebration was over, and I think he really tried to smile as he  thanked me with his eyes.    The next day after the services, although it was Christmas Day, we set  to work on the disinfecting of the large cabin in which the sick had  lain. Stringing"]]]
