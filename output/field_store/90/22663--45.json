As it is invidious to make comparisons, I will not say  that they were foremost in the first rank; but all who knew them will  bear me out in saying they attained a high place in the first rank of  the missionary band.    [Sidenote: LONDON MISSION IN BENARES.]    The Rev. Matthew Thomson Adam was appointed by the London Missionary  Society to Benares in October 1819, and reached his destination in  August, 1820. He remained at his post till 1830, when he returned to  England, and resigned his connection with the Society. He afterwards  went to the United States, where he undertook a pastorate. Mr. Adam was  a scholarly and diligent man. He prepared and published a Hindee  Grammar, an English and Hindee Dictionary, and some tracts. He secured  a site for a mission-house on the border of cantonment towards the city,  and erected on it a commodious and substantial structure; and since his  day a church, a school-house for girls, and houses for native  Christians, have been erected in the mission compound. He also secured a  very central site in cantonments for a place of worship for holding  English services, and by the liberal help of the English military and  civil residents erected on it a building which was called Union Chapel.  His services among our countrymen seem to have been greatly valued, but  owing to a change in the _personnel_ of the station, a change which is  going on incessantly in India, the congregation fell off, Union Chapel  was sold, and the money realized by the sale was spent on the erection  of a chapel in the city, on a site obtained with great difficulty. Mr.  Adam left Benares before this building, erected with a view to native  services, could be turned to account. In a brief record of his labours  drawn up by himself, he says that he deemed it a high honour to live  near such a city, and to testify to his Master by pressing His claims on  individuals with whom he had an opportunity of conversing; but he did  not think it advisable to attempt the preaching of the gospel in places  of public resort. He was at times encouraged by the prospect of persons  becoming the followers of Christ, but in every case his hopes were  disappointed. No native was baptized by him.    The London Mission of Benares was reinforced in 1826 by the arrival of  the Rev. James Robertson. He was a man of linguistic talent, and was  full of plans for setting up the standard of the Cross and assailing the  idolatry around him. He opened a number of schools in various parts of  the city, and organized a system of Bible-reading in the streets. Seven  men, chosen from among Hindus, whose sole qualification was ability to  read, were appointed to read daily in different parts of the city our  Scriptures without note or comment. We have no doubt they took care to  tell their hearers that they did their work to please the sahib, and get  his pay, but had no intention of accepting the new teaching, and had no  wish that others should do so. No other missionary has followed this  plan. Mr. Robertson left behind him in MS. translations into Urdu of a  part of the Old Testament, which were carefully examined and partly used  by Mr. Shurman; but the style was too difficult for any except those who  were well acquainted with the Persian language.    The Rev. William Buyers joined the Mission at the beginning of 1832, and  Mr. Robertson was carried off by cholera fifteen months afterwards, in  his thirty-fourth year. Mr. Buyers was thus left alone, but early in  1834 he was joined by the Rev. J. A. Shurman and the Rev. Robert C.  Mather. In 1838 the Rev. W. P. Lyon arrived at Benares, and that year  Mr. Mather went to the great commercial Mirzapore, where he established,  and for many years afterwards conducted with great efficiency, a very  important mission. When I reached Benares I was thus the fourth on its  staff, and the seventh from its commencement.    Much good work had been done by the brethren with whom I was to be  associated. They had established schools for primary education, but  owing to the want of funds all but one had been given up by 1839. They  had taken part in preparing tracts and revising the translation of the  New Testament in Urdu. A place of worship had been erected, and a few  orphans had been gathered. Evangelistic work was being actively  prosecuted in the city.    A short time previous to 1839 the Church Mission had undertaken a very  benevolent and a very difficult work. In 1837 the North-Western  Provinces were desolated by famine. Many thousands perished, everywhere  miserable boys and girls were to be seen who had become orphans, or who  had been abandoned by their parents. At this terrible crisis missions  came forward with the offer of adopting these forsaken children. Fifty  were made over to the Church Mission at Benares, and afterwards many  more were added to this number. Suitable buildings were speedily erected  for their accommodation, and arrangements were made for their education  and support. These children were so emaciated that many died within a  few days of their being brought to the mission. At the close of 1838 an  excellent missionary and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Knorpp, were carried off  by a low fever which attacked them while attending to their charge. By  the hot weather of 1839 the health of the orphans had greatly improved,  and everything was being done which could be done for their temporal and  spiritual welfare.    By the time of my arrival, the missionaries of the Church and London  Missionary Societies--Mr. Lyon excepted, who had arrived only the  preceding year--had fully entered on their work. They had been from  seven to five years at their posts, had acquired a good knowledge of the  native languages, had all the vigour and hopefulness of early middle  life, and were giving themselves zealously to the prosecution of the  great work for which they had gone to India.          CHAPTER V.    MY FIRST YEAR IN BENARES.      A stranger passing hurriedly through a country may carry away  impressions about its climate, products, and people, which residence for  a considerable time would not merely modify but reverse. There are some  things of which he can speak with some confidence. The great natural  features of a country, its mountains and plains and rivers, do not  undergo any marked change, and these may be truly described by the  casual visitor. The general aspect of a people, their houses, dress, and  look, remain much the same, and of these an accurate observer may give a  trustworthy account; but if from what he himself has seen and heard he  attempts to give a general estimate of the character of the people and  of the state of the country, he is almost sure to fall into great  mistakes.    Within the last few years India has become a favourite field for  travellers who can without inconvenience spend a few hundred pounds, and  be absent from home three or four months. Swift steamers take them  quickly to and from Bombay, and railways carry them in a short time from  one end of India to the other. They travel at the season when travelling  is delightful, and thus see the different countries of that great region  in their most attractive form. If they infer what they do not see from  what they see, they are sure to make statements utterly discordant with  fact. Mr. Wilson, who was sent out to India to put its finances into  order after the Mutiny, travelled through the North-Western Provinces in  the cold weather, when the country was covered with abundant crops, and  was delighted with all he saw. He declared it was the finest country he  had ever seen. He returned to Calcutta as the hot weather was setting  in, and died in the succeeding rainy season. It is said that some time  before his death he pronounced the climate to be the most detestable on  the face of the globe. Dr. Norman McLeod was our guest for a very short  time in Benares, as he was prosecuting his Indian journey. When driving  about on a fine balmy morning, he said, in his genial fashion, \"You  missionaries often complain of your climate; I only wish we in Scotland  had a climate like this.\" To which I replied, \"Ah, doctor, kindly stop  with us through our coming seasons; prolong your stay till next  November, and then you will be able to speak with authority.\" The worthy  doctor did not take my counsel. His death some time afterwards was  attributed to his Indian tour; but if it left in him the seed of  disease, the blame rests not on the climate, but on the excessive  fatigue caused by overmuch travelling and work.    The case of a person who has lived through a whole year in a country,  and has during that period moved among the people, is very different  from that of the passing stranger. He knows the climate as a traveller  for a few weeks or even months cannot. The seasons during that year may  have been more or less abnormal, and yet the resident cannot fail to  have obtained that knowledge which enables him to form a notion of what  he has in the main to expect every year. He gets a glimpse into the  character and peculiarities of the different classes of the population,  both native and foreign. He may know little of the language of the  country; but if he has an observing mind, and moves freely about, he is  constantly receiving information about the people in a degree which he  himself does not always realize. If his residence be prolonged for many  years, as he looks back to his first year, and remembers its experience,  he finds that his views have been greatly enlarged, on many points  greatly modified; he is sure that his knowledge is much more accurate  and mature; but there is scarcely any subject on which he finds his  views entirely reversed.    [Sidenote: THE EXPERIENCE OF THE FIRST YEAR.]    This, at least, has been my experience. I have a vivid remembrance of my  first year in Benares--a much more vivid remembrance than I have of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2442"],[0,"History of the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, (#7)"],[1,"seconded by Mr. Stone, speaking for the Iowa  delegation.    In the earlier proceedings of the Convention there had seemed a  disposition to exclude the Tennessee delegation, and Parson Brownlow, an  old line Whig, being called on for a speech, evidenced in the course of  his remarks the small part which partisan considerations were permitted  to play in the purposes and proceedings of the Convention. He said:    'There need be no detaining this Convention for two days in discussions  of various kinds, and the idea I suggest to you as an inducement not to  exclude our delegation is, that we may take it into our heads, before  the thing is over, to present a candidate from that State in rebellion,  for the second office in the gift of the people. We have a man down  there whom it has been my good luck and bad fortune to fight untiringly  and perseveringly for the past twenty-five years--Andrew Johnson.  For the first time, in the Providence of God, three years ago we got  together on the same platform, and we are fighting the devil, Tom  Walker, and Jeff. Davis, side by side.'    Mr. Horace Maynard, a conspicuous Republican of Tennessee, said:    'Mr. President, we but represent the sentiment of those who sent here  the delegation from Tennessee, when we announce that if no one else  had made the nomination of Andrew Johnson, which is now before the  Convention, it would have been our duty to make it by one of our own  delegation. That citizen, known, honored, distinguished, has been  presented to this Convention for the second place in the gift of the  American people. It needs not that I should add words of commendation  of him here. From the time he rose in the Senate of the United States,  where he then was, on the 17th day of December, 1860, and met the  leaders of treason face to face, and denounced them there, and declared  that the laws of the country must and should be enforced, for which he  was hanged in a effigy in the City of Memphis, in his own State, by the  hands of a negro slave, and burned in effigy, I know not in how many  places throughout that portion of the country--from that time, on during  the residue of that session of the Senate until he returned to Tennessee  after the firing upon Fort Sumter, when he was mobbed in the City of  Lynchburg, Virginia--on through the memorable canvass that followed in  Tennessee, till he passed through Cumberland Gap on his way North  to invoke the aid of the Government for his people--his position of  determined and undying hostility to this rebellion that now ravages  the land, has been so well known that it is a part of the household  knowledge of many loyal families in the country. * * * When he sees your  resolutions that you have adopted here by acclamation, he will respond  to them as his sentiments, and I pledge myself by all that I have to  pledge before such an assemblage as this, that whether he be elected to  this high place, or whether he retire to private life, he will adhere to  those sentiments, and to the doctrine of those resolutions, as long as  his reason remains unimpaired, and as long as breath is given him by his  God.    Two ballots were taken on the nomination for Vice President. Mr.  Johnson, whose nomination was known to be desired by Mr. Lincoln and  his friends because of his prominence as a Southern Democrat and an  influential supporter of the Union cause in his State, received 200  votes on the first ballot, and 404 on the second--the delegations  of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,  Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri,  Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon,  West Virginia, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and Nevada, voting solidly  for him--Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Wisconsin and Minnesota,  only, being divided.    Thus a Republican and a Democrat were made the nominees of the  Convention, and its non-partisan character found further expression  in the first three Resolutions of the Platform adopted, which were as  follows:    Resolved, 1st. That it is the highest duty of every American citizen to  maintain against all their enemies the integrity of the Union and the  paramount authority of the Constitution and laws of the United States;  and that laying aside ALL DIFFERENCES OF POLITICAL OPINION, we pledge  ourselves as Union men, animated by a common sentiment and aiming at a  common object, to do everything in our power to aid the Government  in quelling by force of arms the rebellion now raging against its  authority, and in bringing to the punishment due to their crimes the  rebels and traitors arrayed against it.    2nd. That we approve the determination of the Government of the United  States not to compromise with Rebels, or to offer them any terms of  peace, except such as may be based upon an unconditional surrender  of their hostility and a return to their just allegiance to the  Constitution and laws of the United States, and that we call upon the  Government to maintain their position, and to prosecute the war with the  utmost possible vigor to the complete suppression of the Rebellion, in  full reliance upon the self-sacrificing patriotism, the heroic valor  and the undying devotion of the American people to their country and its  free institutions.    3rd. That as slavery was the cause, and now constitutes the strength, of  this Rebellion, and as it must be, always and everywhere, hostile to  the principles of Republican Government, justice and the National safety  demand its utter and complete extirpation from the soil of the Republic;  and that, while we uphold and maintain the acts and proclamation by  which the Government in its own defense, has aimed a death blow at this  gigantic evil, we are in favor, furthermore, of such an amendment to  the Constitution, to be made by the people in conformity with its  provisions, as shall terminate and forever prohibit the existence of  slavery within the limits or jurisdiction of the United States.    So there seems to be good ground for saying that this was in no sense a  partisan Convention, but, on the contrary, that it was a Convention of  the loyal people of the Northern and Border States, of all parties, who  were ready to lay aside party creeds and partisan considerations, the  better to make common cause for the preservation of the Union.    Before the war, Mr. Johnson had been a Democratic Senator from  Tennessee, and during the war, a gentleman of great influence in support  of the Union cause. So pronounced and effective had been his loyalty  that Mr. Lincoln appointed him a Brigadier General and Military Governor  of Tennessee, to accept which he resigned his seat in the Senate, and so  judicious and successful had been his administration of that office in  behalf of the Union cause and of Union men, that Tennessee was the first  of the revolted States to be readmitted to representation in Congress  after the close of the war.    So it may be said of Mr. Johnson that he was a persistent and consistent  Union Democrat of the old school--for war so long as war might be  necessary to the preservation of the Union--for peace when the war was  ended by the abandonment of the struggle by the insurgents--and for  the restoration of the Union on terms consistent with then existing  conditions--without slavery, which was dead--and the return of the  people of the South to their loyalty to and support of the Government  without debasing exactions--after they had laid down their arms.  Aggressively radical so long as the people of the South continued in  rebellion, he was considerate and merciful so soon as they yielded  themselves to the authority of law and of the Union.    Like Mr. Lincoln, he opposed the idea strenuously advanced by Sumner,  and Stevens, and that wing of the Republican party which they led, that  the States in rebellion had committed suicide and were therefore  dead and without rights, or entitled to consideration, even, in any  proposition that might be adopted for their rehabilitation.    This record very effectually disposes of the criticisms of Mr. Johnson's  course, so common after he came to the Presidency and growing out of his  disagreements with the extremists of Congress, that he had deserted  and betrayed the Republican party after it had elected him to the Vice  Presidency and thus made him Mr. Lincoln's immediate successor--the  facts of history showing that neither Mr. Lincoln nor Mr. Johnson were  elected by the Republican party as Republicans, nor by the Democratic  party as Democrats, but by a union of all parties of the North  distinctively as a Union party and on a Union ticket and platform for  the preservation of the Union and the destruction of slavery--and when  those purposes were accomplished, the war ended and the Union party  disbanded and was never heard of again. Mr. Lincoln, had he lived,  would doubtless have still been a Republican, as Mr. Johnson was still  a Democrat, as before the war--the purpose of that war and of the  Convention that nominated him having been accomplished--and under no  obligations, especially of a partisan character, to adopt or promote the  partisan purposes relative to reconstruction or otherwise, that came to  actuate the Republican party.    As stated. Mr..Johnson had, during the later years of the war, been  acting as Military Governor of Tennessee, of which State he had been a  citizen nearly all his life. His administration had been so efficient  that Tennessee was practically restored to the Union at the close of the  War, and so satisfactory to the loyal people of the country, that though  an old line Democrat and a Southern man, Mr. Johnson's nomination by the  National Convention for Vice President on the ticket with Mr. Lincoln  for President, was, as has been shown, logical and consistent. Though  a pronounced State Rights Democrat and a citizen of a Southern State  in "]]]
