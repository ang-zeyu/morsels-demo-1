They are beings only of the mind, conjured up  for the most part in sickness, when the patient is especially subject to  fear. For sickness induces fear of spirits; fear of spirits causes the  mind to dwell upon them; and thus apparitions are produced.\"    Another writer enlarges on the view that _kuei_ \"disembodied spirit\" is  the same as _kuei_ \"to return.\" \"At death, man's soul returns to heaven,  his flesh to earth, his blood to water, his blood-vessels to marshes,  his voice to thunder, his motion to the wind, his sleep to the sun and  moon, his bones to trees, his muscles to hills, his teeth to stones, his  fat to dew, his hair to grass, while his breath returns to man.\"    Attributes of God.--There was a certain philosopher, named Ch'in Mi  (died A.D. 226), whose services were much required by the King of Wu,  who sent an envoy to fetch him. The envoy took upon himself to catechise  the philosopher, with the following result:--    \"You are engaged in study, are you not?\" asked the envoy.    \"Any slip of a boy may be that,\" replied Ch'in; \"why not I?\"    \"Has God a head?\" said the envoy.    \"He has,\" was the reply.    \"Where is He?\" was the next question.    \"In the West. The _Odes_ say,         He gazed fondly on the West,    From which it may be inferred that his head was in the West.\"    \"Has God got ears?\"    \"God sits on high,\" replied Ch'in, \"but hears the lowly. The _Odes_ say,         The crane cries in the marsh,       And its cry is heard by God.    If He had not ears, how could He hear it?\"    \"Has God feet?\" asked the envoy.    \"He has,\" replied Ch'in. \"The _Odes_ say,         The steps of God are difficult;       This man does not follow them.    If He had no feet, how could He step?\"    \"Has God a surname?\" enquired the envoy. \"And if so, what is it?\"    \"He has a surname,\" said Ch'in, \"and it is Liu.\"    \"How do you know that?\" rejoined the other.    \"The surname of the Emperor, who is the Son of Heaven, is Liu,\" replied  Ch'in; \"and that is how I know it.\"    These answers, we are told, came as quickly as echo after sound. A  writer of the ninth century A.D., when reverence for the one God of  ancient China had been to a great extent weakened by the multiplication  of inferior deities, tells a story how this God, whose name was Liu, had  been displaced by another God whose name was Chang.    The _Hsing ying tsa lu_ has the following story. There was once a very  poor scholar, who made it his nightly practice to burn incense and pray  to God. One evening he heard a voice from above, saying, \"God has been  touched by your earnestness, and has sent me to ask what you require.\"  \"I wish,\" replied the scholar, \"for clothes and food, coarse if you  will, sufficient for my necessities in this life, and to be able to  roam, free from care, among the mountains and streams, until I complete  my allotted span; that is all.\" \"All!\" cried the voice, amid peals of  laughter from the clouds. \"Why, that is the happiness enjoyed by the  spirits in heaven; you can't have that. Ask rather for wealth and rank.\"    Good and Evil.--It has already been stated that the Chinese imagination  has never conceived of an Evil One, deliverance from whom might be  secured by prayer. The existence of evil in the abstract has however  received some attention.    Wei Tao Tzu asked Yu Li Tzu, saying, \"Is it true that God loves good and  hates evil?\"    \"It is,\" replied Yu.    \"In that case,\" rejoined Wei, \"goodness should abound in the Empire  and evil should be scarce. Yet among birds, kites and falcons outnumber  phoenixes; among beasts, wolves are many and unicorns are few; among  growing plants, thorns are many and cereals are few; among those who eat  cooked food and stand erect, the wicked are many and the virtuous are  few; and in none of these cases can you say that the latter are evil and  the former good. Can it be possible that what man regards as evil, God  regards as good, and _vice versa_? Is it that God is unable to determine  the characteristics of each, and lets each follow its own bent and  develop good or evil accordingly? If He allows good men to be put upon,  and evil men to be a source of fear, is not this to admit that God has  His likes and dislikes? From of old until now, times of misgovernment  have always exceeded times of right government; and when men of  principle have contended with the ignoble, the latter have usually won.  Where then is God's love of good and hatred of evil?\"    Yu Li Tzu had no answer to make.    The _Tan yen tsa lu_ says, \"If the people are contented and happy, God  is at peace in His mind. When God is at peace in His mind, the two great  motive Powers act in harmony.\"    Where is God?--The _Pi ch'ou_ says, \"The empyrean above you is not God;  it is but His outward manifestation. That which remains ever fixed in  man's heart and which rules over all things without cease, that is  God. Alas, you earnestly seek God in the blue sky, while forgetting Him  altogether in your hearts. Can you expect your prayers to be answered?\"    This view--\"For behold, the kingdom of God is within you,\" St. Luke  xvii. 21,--has been brought out by the philosopher Shao Yung, A.D.  1011-1077, in the following lines:--         The heavens are still: no sound.       Where then shall God be found? . . .       Search not in distant skies;       In man's own heart He lies.    Conflict of Faiths.--Han Wen-kung, A.D. 768-824, the eminent  philosopher, poet, and statesman, who suffered banishment for his  opposition to the Buddhist religion, complains that, \"of old there was  but one faith; now there are three,\"--meaning Confucianism, Buddhism,  and Taoism. He thus pictures the simplicity of China's ancient kings:--    \"Their clothes were of cloth or of silk. They dwelt in palaces or in  ordinary houses. They ate grain and vegetables and fruit and fish and  flesh. Their method was easy of comprehension: their doctrines were  easily carried into practice. Hence their lives passed pleasantly away,  a source of satisfaction to themselves, a source of benefit to mankind.  At peace within their own hearts, they readily adapted themselves to  the necessities of the family and of the State. Happy in life, they were  remembered after death. Their sacrifices were grateful to the God of  Heaven, and the spirits of the departed rejoiced in the honours of  ancestral worship.\"    His mind seems to have been open on the subject of a future state. In a  lamentation on the death of a favourite nephew, he writes,    \"If there is knowledge after death, this separation will be but for a  little while. If there is no knowledge after death, so will this sorrow  be but for a little while, and then no more sorrow for ever.\"    His views as to the existence of spirits on this earth are not very  logical:--    \"If there is whistling among the rafters, and I take a light but fail to  see anything,--is that a spirit? It is not; for spirits are soundless.  If there is something in the room, and I look for it but cannot see  it,--is that a spirit? It is not; spirits are formless. If something  brushes against me, and I grab at, but do not seize it,--is that a  spirit? It is not; for if spirits are soundless and formless, how can  they have substance?    \"If then spirits have neither sound nor form nor substance, are they  consequently non-existent? Things which have form without sound exist in  nature; for instance, earth, and stones. Things which have sound without  form exist in nature; for instance, wind, and thunder. Things which have  both sound and form exist in nature; for instance, men, and animals.  And things which have neither sound nor form also exist in nature; for  instance, disembodied spirits and angels.\"    For his own poetical spirit, according to the funeral elegy written  some two hundred and fifty years after his death, a great honour was  reserved:--         Above in heaven there was no music, and God was sad,       And summoned him to his place beside the Throne.    His friend and contemporary, Liu Tsung-yuan, a poet and philosopher like  himself, was tempted into the following reflections by the contemplation  of a beautiful landscape which he discovered far from the beaten  track:--    \"Now, I have always had my doubts about the existence of a God; but this  scene made me think He really must exist. At the same time, however,  I began to wonder why He did not place it in some worthy centre of  civilisation, rather than in this out-of-the-way barbarous region, where  for centuries there has been no one to enjoy its beauty. And so, on the  other hand, such waste of labour and incongruity of position disposed me  to think that there could not be a God after all.\"    Letter from God.--In A.D. 1008 there was a pretended revelation from God  in the form of a letter, recalling the letter from Christ on the neglect  of the Sabbath mentioned by Roger of Wendover and Hoveden, contemporary  chroniclers. The Emperor and his Court regarded this communication with  profound awe; but a high official of the day said, \"I have learnt (from  the Confucian Discourses) that God does not even speak; how then should  He write a letter?\"    Modern Materialism.--The philosopher and commentator, Chu Hsi, A.D.  1130-1200, whose interpretations of the Confucian Canon are the only  ones now officially recognised, has done more than any one since  Confucius himself to disseminate a rigid materialism among his  fellow-countrymen. The \"God\" of the Canon is explained away as an  \"Eternal Principle;\" the phenomena of the universe are attributed to  Nature, with its absurd personification so commonly met with in Western  writers; and spirits generally are associated with the perfervid  imaginations of sick persons and enthusiasts.    \"Is consciousness dispersed after death, or does it still exist?\" said  an enquirer.    \"It is not dispersed,\" replied Chu Hsi; \"it is at an end.

In using a straight line or lining pen with a T square it may be used as  in Figure 36, being nearly vertical, as shown, and moved from left to  right as denoted by the arrow, S representing the square blade. But in  using it, or a pencil, with a straight edge or a triangle unsupported by  the square blade, the latter should be steadied by letting the fingers  rest upon it while using the instrument, the operation being shown in  Figure 37. The position, Figure 36, is suitable for long lines, and that  in Figure 37 for small drawings, where the pen requires close adjustment  to the lines.          CHAPTER III.    _LINES AND CURVES._      Although the beginner will find that a study of geometry is not  essential to the production of such elementary examples of mechanical  drawing as are given in this book, yet as more difficult examples are  essayed he will find such a study to be of great advantage and  assistance. Meantime the following explanation of simple geometrical  terms is all that is necessary to an understanding of the examples  given.    The shortest distance between two points is termed the radius; and, in  the case of a circle, means the distance from the centre to the  perimeter measured in a straight line.    [Illustration: Fig. 38.]    [Illustration: Fig. 39.]    [Illustration: Fig. 40.]    Dotted lines, thus, <----->, mean the direction and the points at which a  dimension is taken or marked. Dotted lines, thus,-----, simply connect  the same parts or lines in different views of the object. Thus in  Figure 38 are a side and an end view of a rivet, and the dotted lines  show that the circles on the end view correspond to the circle of the  diameters of the head and of the stem, and therefore represent their  diameters while showing that both are round. A straight line is in  geometry termed a right line.    A line at a right angle to another is said to be perpendicular to it;  thus, in Figures 39, 40, and 41, lines A are in each case perpendicular  to line B, or line B is in each case perpendicular to line A.    A point is a position or location supposed to have no size, and in cases  where necessary is indicated by a dot.    [Illustration: Fig. 41.]    [Illustration: Fig. 42.]    [Illustration: Fig. 43.]    Parallel lines are those equidistant one from the other throughout their  length, as in Figure 42. Lines maybe parallel though not straight; thus,  in Figure 43, the lines are parallel.    [Illustration: Fig. 44.]    [Illustration: Fig. 45.]    [Illustration: Fig. 46.]    A line is said to be _produced_ when it is extended beyond its natural  limits: thus, in Figure 44, lines A and B are _produced_ in the point C.    A line is bisected when the centre of its length is marked: thus, line A  in Figure 45 is bisected, at or in, as it is termed, _e_.    The line bounding a circle is termed its circumference or periphery and  sometimes the perimeter.    A part of this circumference is termed an arc of a circle or an arc;  thus Figure 46 represents an arc. When this arc has breadth it is termed  a segment; thus Figures 47 and 48 are segments of a circle. A straight  line cutting off an arc is termed the chord of the arc; thus, in Figure  48, line A is the chord of the arc.    [Illustration: Fig. 47.]    [Illustration: Fig. 48.]    [Illustration: Fig. 49.]    [Illustration: Fig. 50.]    [Illustration: Fig. 51.]    A quadrant of a circle is one quarter of the same, being bounded on two  of its sides by two radial lines, as in Figure 49.    When the area of a circle that is enclosed within two radial lines is  either less or more than one quarter of the whole area of the circle the  figure is termed a sector; thus, in Figure 50, A and B are both sectors  of a circle.    A straight line touching the perimeter of a circle is said to be tangent  to that circle, and the point at which it touches is that to which it is  tangent; thus, in Figure 51, line A is tangent to the circle at point B.  The half of a circle is termed a semicircle; thus, in Figure 52, A B and  C are each a semicircle.    [Illustration: Fig. 52.]    [Illustration: Fig. 53.]    The point from which a circle or arc of a circle is drawn is termed its  centre. The line representing the centre of a cylinder is termed its  axis; thus, in Figure 53, dot _d_ represents the centre of the circle,  and line _b b_ the axial line of the cylinder.    To draw a circle that shall pass through any three given points: Let A B  and C in Figure 54 be the points through which the circumference of a  circle is to pass. Draw line D connecting A to C, and line E connecting  B to C. Bisect D in F and E in G. From F as a centre draw the semicircle  O, and from G as a centre draw the semicircle P; these two semicircles  meeting the two ends of the respective lines D E. From B as a centre  draw arc H, and from C the arc I, bisecting P in J. From A as a centre  draw arc K, and from C the arc L, bisecting the semicircle O in M. Draw  a line passing through M and F, and a line passing through J and Q, and  where these two lines intersect, as at Q, is the centre of a circle R  that will pass through all three of the points A B and C.    [Illustration: Fig. 54.]    [Illustration: Fig. 55.]    To find the centre from which an arc of a circle has been struck: Let A  A in Figure 55 be the arc whose centre is to be found. From the extreme  ends of the arc bisect it in B. From end A draw the arc C, and from B  the arc D. Then from the end A draw arc G, and from B the arc F. Draw  line H passing through the two points of intersections of arcs C D, and  line I passing through the two points of intersection of F G, and where  H and I meet, as at J, is the centre from which the arc was drawn.    A degree of a circle is the 1/360 part of its circumference. The whole  circumference is supposed to be divided into 360 equal divisions, which  are called the degrees of a circle; but, as one-half of the circle is  simply a repetition of the other half, it is not necessary for  mechanical purposes to deal with more than one-half, as is done in  Figure 56. As the whole circle contains 360 degrees, half of it will  contain one-half of that number, or 180; a quarter will contain 90, and  an eighth will contain 45 degrees. In the protractors (as the  instruments having the degrees of a circle marked on them are termed)  made for sale the edges of the half-circle are marked off into degrees  and half-degrees; but it is sufficient for the purpose of this  explanation to divide off one quarter by lines 10 degrees apart, and the  other by lines 5 degrees apart. The diameter of the circle obviously  makes no difference in the number of decrees contained in any portion of  it. Thus, in the quarter from 0 to 90, there are 90 degrees, as marked;  but suppose the diameter of the circle were that of inner circle _d_,  and one-quarter of it would still contain 90 degrees.    [Illustration: Fig. 56.]    So, likewise, the degrees of one line to another are not always taken  from one point, as from the point O, but from any one line to another.  Thus the line marked 120 is 60 degrees from line 180, or line 90 is 60  degrees from line 150. Similarly in the other quarter of the circle 60  degrees are marked. This may be explained further by stating that the  point O or zero may be situated at the point from which the degrees of  angle are to be taken. Here it may be remarked that, to save writing the  word \"degrees,\" it is usual to place on the right and above the figures  a small  deg., as is done in Figure 56, the 60 deg. meaning sixty degrees, the   deg., of course, standing for degrees.    [Illustration: Fig. 57.]    Suppose, then, we are given two lines, as _a_ and _b_ in Figure 57, and  are required to find their angle one to the other. Then, if we have a  protractor, we may apply it to the lines and see how many degrees of  angle they contain. This word \"contain\" means how many degrees of angle  there are between the lines, which, in the absence of a protractor, we  may find by prolonging the lines until they meet in a point as at _c_.  From this point as a centre we draw a circle D, passing through both  lines _a_, _b_. All we now have to do is to find what part, or how much  of the circumference, of the circle is enclosed within the two lines. In  the example we find it is the one-twelfth part; hence the lines are 30  degrees apart, for, as the whole circle contains 360, then one-twelfth  must contain 30, because 360/12 = 30.    [Illustration: Fig. 58.]    If we have three lines, as lines A B and C in Figure 58, we may find  their angles one to the other by projecting or prolonging the lines  until they meet as at points D, E, and F, and use these points as the  centres wherefrom to mark circles as G, H, and I. Then, from circle H,  we may, by dividing it, obtain the angle of A to B or of B to A. By  dividing circle I we may obtain the angle of A to C or of C to A, and by  dividing circle G we may obtain the angle of B to C or of C to B.    [Illustration: Fig. 59.]    It may happen, and, indeed, generally will do so, that the first attempt  will not succeed, because the distance between the lines measured, or  the arc of the circle, will not divide the circle without having the  last division either too long or too short, in which case the circle may  be divided as follows: The compasses set to its radius, or half its  diameter, will divide the circle into 6 equal divisions, and each of  these divisions will contain 60 degrees of angle, because 360 (the  number of degrees in the whole circle) /6 (the number of divisions) =  60, the number of degrees in each division. We may, therefore, subdivide  as many of the divisions as are necessary for the two lines whose  degrees of angle are to be found. Thus, in Figure 59, are two lines, C,  D, and it is required to find their angle one to the other. The circle  is divided into six"]]]
