The evils too obviously existed to be overlooked; but  it is not my place to further expose them; a more pleasing duty guides my  pen; others have done all this, lashing them painfully for their oft-told  sins. Frail humanity glories in chastizing the frailty of brother man.  But we will not denounce them here, for did not the day of retribution  come? And was not justice satisfied? Having made these few preliminary  remarks, let us, in a brief manner, inquire into the system observed in  the cloisters by the monks for the preservation and transcription of  manuscripts. Let us peep into the quiet cells of those old monks, and see  whether history warrants the unqualified contempt which their efforts in  this department have met with.    In most monasteries there were two kinds of Scriptoria, or writing  offices; for in addition to the large and general apartment used for the  transcription of church books and manuscripts for the library, there were  also several smaller ones occupied by the superiors and the more learned  members of the community, as closets for private devotion and study. Thus  we read, that in the Cistercian orders there were places set apart for  the transcription of books called Scriptoria, or cells assigned to the  scribes, \"separate from each other,\" where the books might be transcribed  in the strictest silence, according to the holy rules of their  founders.[40] These little cells were usually situated in the most  retired part of the monastery, and were probably incapable of  accommodating more than one or two persons;[41] dull and comfortless  places, no doubt, yet they were deemed great luxuries, and the use of  them only granted to such as became distinguished for their piety, or  erudition. We read that when David went to the Isle of Wight, to  Paulinus, to receive his education, he used to sup in the Refectory, but  had a Scriptorium, or study, in his cell, being a famous scribe.[42] The  aged monks, who often lived in these little offices, separate from the  rest of the scribes, were not expected to work so arduously as the rest.  Their employment was comparatively easy; nor were they compelled to work  so long as those in the cloister.[43] There is a curious passage in  Tangmar's Life of St. Bernward, which would lead us to suspect that  private individuals possessed Scriptoria; for, says he, there are  Scriptoria, not only in the monasteries, but in other places, in which  are conceived books equal to the divine works of the philosophers.[44]  The Scriptorium of the monastery in which the general business of a  literary nature was transacted, was an apartment far more extensive and  commodious, fitted up with forms and desks methodically arranged, so as  to contain conveniently a great number of copyists. In some of the  monasteries and cathedrals, they had long ranges of seats one after  another, at which were seated the scribes, one well versed in the subject  on which the book treated, recited from the copy whilst they wrote; so  that, on a word being given out by him, it was copied by all.[45] The  multiplication of manuscripts, under such a system as this, must have  been immense; but they did not always make books, _fecit libros_, as  they called it, in this wholesale manner, but each monk diligently  labored at the transcription of a separate work.    The amount of labor carried on in the Scriptorium, of course, in many  cases depended upon the revenues of the abbey, and the disposition of the  abbot; but this was not always the case, as in some monasteries they  undertook the transcription of books as a matter of commerce, and added  broad lands to their house by the industry of their pens. But the  Scriptorium was frequently supported by resources solely applicable to  its use. Laymen, who had a taste for literature, or who entertained an  esteem for it in others, often at their death bequeathed estates for the  support of the monastic Scriptoria. Robert, one of the Norman leaders,  gave two parts of the tythes of Hatfield, and the tythes of Redburn, for  the support of the Scriptorium of St. Alban's.[46] The one belonging to  the monastery of St. Edmundsbury was endowed with two mills,[47] and in  the church of Ely there is a charter of Bishof Nigellus, granting to the  Scriptorium of the monastery the tythes of Wythessey and Impitor, two  parts of the tythes of the Lordship of Pampesward, with 2s. 2d., and a  messuage in Ely _ad faciendos et emandandos libros_.[48]    The abbot superintended the management of the Scriptorium, and decided  upon the hours for their labor, during which time they were ordered to  work with unremitting diligence, \"not leaving to go and wander in  idleness,\" but to attend solely to the business of transcribing. To  prevent detraction or interruption, no one was allowed to enter except  the abbot, the prior, the sub-prior, and the armarian,[49] as the latter  took charge of all the materials and implements used by the transcribers,  it was his duty to prepare and give them out when required; he made the  ink and cut the parchment ready for use. He was strictly enjoined,  however, to exercise the greatest economy in supplying these precious  materials, and not to give more copies \"nec artavos, nec cultellos, nec  scarpellae, nec membranes,\" than was actually necessary, or than he had  computed as sufficient for the work; and what the armarian gave them the  monks were to receive without contradiction or contention.[50]    The utmost silence prevailed in the Scriptorium; rules were framed, and  written admonitions hung on the walls, to enforce the greatest care and  diligence in copying exactly from the originals. In Alcuin's works we  find one of these preserved; it is a piece inscribed \"_Ad Musaeum libros  scribentium_;\" the lines are as follows:        \"Hic sideant sacrae scribentes famina legis,        Nec non sanctorum dicta sacrata Patrum,      Haec interserere caveant sua frivola verbis,        Frivola nec propter erret et ipsa manus:        Correctosque sibi quaerant studiose libellos,        Tramite quo recto penna volantis eat.      Per cola distinquant proprios, et commata sensus,        Et punctos ponant ordine quosque suo.        Ne vel falsa legat, taceat vel forte repente,        Ante pios fratres, lector in Ecclesia.      Est opus egregium sacros jam scribete libros,        Nec mercede sua scriptor et ipse caret.        Fodere quam vites, melius est scribere libros,        Ille suo ventri serviet, iste animae.      Vel nova, vel vetera poterit proferre magister        Plurima, quisque legit dicta sacrata Patrum.\"[51]    Other means were resorted to besides these to preserve the text of their  books immaculate, it was a common practice for the scribe at the end of  his copy, to adjure all who transcribed from it to use the greatest care,  and to refrain from the least alteration of word or sense. Authors more  especially followed this course, thus at the end of some we find such  injunctions as this.    \"I adjure you who shall transcribe this book, by our Lord Jesus Christ  and by his glorious coming, who will come to judge the quick and the  dead, that you compare what you transcribe and diligently correct it by  the copy from which you transcribe it--this adjuration also--and insert  it in your copy.\"[52]    The Consuetudines Canonicorum, before referred to, also particularly  impressed this upon the monks, and directed that all the brothers who  were engaged as scribes, were not to alter any writing, although in their  own mind they might think it proper, without first receiving the sanction  of the abbot, \"_on no account were they to commit so great a  presumption_.\"[53] But notwithstanding that the scribes were thus  enjoined to use the utmost care in copying books, doubtless an occasional  error crept in, which many causes might have produced, such as bad light,  haste, a little drowsiness, imperfect sight, or even a flickering lamp  was sufficient to produce some trivial error; but in works of importance  the smallest error is of consequence, as some future scribe puzzled by  the blunder, might, in an attempt to correct, still more augment the  imperfection; to guard against this, with respect to the Scriptures, the  most critical care was enforced. Monks advanced in age were alone allowed  to transcribe them, and after their completion they were  read--revised--and reread again, and it is by that means that so uniform  a reading has been preserved, and although slight differences may here  and there occur, there are no books which have traversed through the  shadows of the dark ages, that preserve their original text so pure and  uncorrupt as the copies of the Scriptures, the fathers of the church, and  the ancient writings of the classic authors; sometimes, it is true, a  manuscript of the last order is discovered possessing a very different  reading in some particular passage; but these appear rather as futile  emendations or interpolations of the scribe than as the result of a  downright blunder, and are easily perceivable, for when the monkish  churchmen tampered with ancient copies, it generally originated in a  desire to smooth over the indecencies of the heathen authors, and so  render them less liable to corrupt the holy contemplations of the  devotee; and while we blame the pious fraud, we cannot but respect the  motive that dictated it.    But as regards the Scriptures, we talk of the carelessness of the monks  and the interpolations of the scribes as if these were faults peculiar to  the monastic ages alone; alas! the history of Biblical transmission tells  us differently, the gross perversions, omissions, and errors wrought in  the holy text, proclaim how prevalent these same faults have been in the  ages of _printed literature_, and which appear more palpable by being  produced amidst deep scholars, and surrounded with all the critical  acumen of a learned age.

Otherwise he might have been considerably embarrassed.    The children asked a great many questions of Dick about the pictures,  some of which he could not answer. Johnny, on being shown the picture of  a Turkish mosque, asked if that was the place where the turkeys went to  church.    \"If there was any place for a goose to go to church, you'd go there,\"  said his sister.    \"I aint a goose any more than you are,\" said Johnny, indignantly; \"am I,  Dick?\"    Just then the servant came in to carry the children to bed, and,  considerably against their wishes, they were obliged to withdraw.    \"Come again, Dick,\" said Johnny.    \"Thank you,\" said Dick. \"Good-night.\"    \"Good-night,\" said the two children, and the door closed upon them.    \"I think I'll be going,\" said Dick, who did not feel quite so much at  ease, now that his young friends had left him.    \"Wait a few minutes,\" said Mrs. Rockwell.    She rang the bell, and a servant brought up some cake and apples, of  which Dick was invited to partake.    I need not detail the conversation; but Mrs. Rockwell, with the tact of  a genuine lady, managed to draw out Dick, and put him quite at his ease.    \"How old are you, Richard?\" she asked.    \"Fifteen,\" said Dick; \"goin' on sixteen.\"    \"You are getting to be quite a young man,--old enough to wear a watch.  Have you one?\"    \"No,\" said Dick, not suspecting the motive that led to her question.    \"Will you allow me the pleasure of supplying the deficiency?\" said Mrs.  Rockwell.    As she spoke, she drew from a box at her side a very neat gold watch and  chain, and placed it in Dick's hands.    Our hero was so astonished at first that he could scarcely believe that  this valuable present was intended for him.    \"Is it for me?\" he asked, hesitatingly.    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Rockwell, smiling pleasantly. \"I hope you will find it  of service.\"    \"It is too much,\" said Dick. \"I do not deserve it.\"    \"You must let me be the judge of that,\" said the lady, kindly. \"Here is  the key; I nearly forgot to give it to you. I suppose you know how to  wind it up?\"    \"Yes,\" said Dick. \"I understand that. I am _very_ much obliged to you.\"    \"You are very welcome. Whenever you look at it, let it remind you that  under all circumstances you can rely upon the friendship of Johnny's  parents.\"    Dick slipped the watch into a watch-pocket in his vest, for which he had  never before had any use, and attached the chain to his button-hole.    \"How beautiful it is!\" he said, in tones of admiration.    \"It was bought at Ball & Black's,\" said Mrs. Rockwell. \"If it should not  keep good time, or anything should happen to it, I advise you to take it  there, and they will repair it for you.\"    Dick perceived by his new watch that it was nearly ten o'clock, and rose  to go. He was kindly invited to renew his visit, and promised to do so.  Just as he was leaving the room, Mr. Rockwell handed a sealed envelope  to Dick, saying, \"Put this in your pocket, Richard. It will be time  enough to open it when you get home.\"    Dick sped home much more quickly than he had come. He thought with  delight of Fosdick's surprise when he should see the new watch and  chain, and also with pardonable exultation of the sensation he would  produce at the table when he carelessly drew out his watch to see what  time it was.    When he reached his boarding-house, and went upstairs, he found Fosdick  sitting up for him.    \"Well, Dick, what sort of a time did you have?\" he asked.    \"Tip-top,\" said Dick.    \"Who did you see?\"    \"Mr. and Mrs. Rockwell, and two children,--Johnny, the one I fished out  of the water, and his sister, Grace. Johnny's a jolly little chap, and  his sister is a nice girl.\"    \"Halloa, what's that?\" asked Fosdick, suddenly espying the watch-chain.    \"What do you think of my new watch?\" asked Dick, drawing it out.    \"Do you mean to say it is yours?\"    \"Yes. Mrs. Rockwell gave it to me.\"    \"It's a regular beauty. Mr. Henderson has got one that he paid a hundred  dollars for; but it isn't as nice as yours.\"    \"Seems to me I have no end of luck,\" said Dick. \"I'll be a young man of  fortun' before I know it.\"    \"People will think you are now, when they see you wear such a watch as  that.\"    \"Johnny Nolan'd think I stole it, if he should see it,\" said Dick. \"Poor  chap! I wish some luck would come to him. I saw him to-day lookin' just  as I used to before I met Frank.\"    \"There's some difference between then and now, Dick.\"    \"Yes. I was a rough chap in them days.\"    \"In those days, Dick.\"    \"In those days, and I don't know but I am now, but I'm trying to  improve. With you to help me, I think I'll grow up respectable.\"    \"I hope we both will, Dick. But who's that letter from that you've just  taken out of your pocket?\"    \"Oh, I forgot. Mr. Rockwell handed it to me just before I came away, and  told me not to open it till I got home. P'r'aps it says that he hasn't  no more occasion for my valuable services.\"    \"That isn't very likely, considering the present you have brought home.  But open it; I am curious to see what is in it.\"    The envelope was cut open, and a piece of paper dropped out.    Fosdick picked it up, and to his inexpressible amazement ascertained  that it was a check on the Park Bank for the sum of one thousand dollars  made payable to Richard Hunter, or order.    \"A thousand dollars!\" repeated Dick, overwhelmed with astonishment;  \"you're only foolin' me. P'r'aps it's ten dollars.\"    \"No, it's a thousand dollars. Read it yourself if you don't believe it.\"    \"I wish you'd pinch me, Fosdick,\" said Dick, seriously.    \"Certainly, if you wish it.\"    \"That's enough,\" said Dick, hastily. \"I only wanted to make sure I  wasn't dreamin'. I can't believe I'm worth a thousand dollars.\"    \"You're a lucky fellow, Dick,\" said Fosdick, \"and you deserve your luck.  I'm heartily glad of it.\"    \"About the best luck I ever had was in meeting you,\" said Dick,  affectionately. \"I'm goin' to give you half the money.\"    \"No, you're not, Dick. Thank you all the same,\" said Fosdick, decidedly.  \"It was meant for you, and you must keep it. I'll get along well enough.  If I don't, I know you'll help me.\"    \"But I wish you'd take half the money.\"    \"No, Dick, it wouldn't be right. But your new watch says it's getting  late, and we had better go to bed.\"    It was some time before Dick fell asleep. His good luck had so excited  him that he found it difficult to calm down sufficiently to sink into a  quiet slumber.          CHAPTER VI.    MR. GILBERT IS ASTONISHED.      When Dick woke up in the morning the first thing he thought of was his  watch, the next the check which he had received from Mr. Rockwell.    \"I'll go to the bank this morning, and get my money,\" said he.    \"How are you going to invest it, Dick?\" asked Fosdick.    \"I don't know,\" said Dick. \"I'll put it in the savings bank till I  decide. That'll make more'n eleven hundred dollars. I didn't use to  think I ever'd be worth that, when I slept in boxes and old wagons.\"    \"Eleven hundred dollars at six per cent. interest will yield you  sixty-six dollars a year.\"    \"So it will,\" said Dick, \"and all without working. I tell you what,  Fosdick, at this rate I'll soon be a man of fortune.\"    \"Yes, if you can make a thousand dollars a day.\"    \"I wonder what old Gilbert'll say when he sees it,\" said Dick.    \"Who's he?\"    \"He's the book-keeper. He aint very fond of me.\"    \"What has he against you?\"    \"He thinks I don't treat him with proper respect,\" said Dick. \"Besides  he tried to get his cousin Roswell Crawford in, but he couldn't.\"    \"Then it seems both of us have interfered with Roswell.\"    \"He's got a place now. I guess he's the senior partner by the way he  talks.\"    The breakfast-bell rang, and the boys went down to breakfast. Clifton  was down already, and was standing in front of stove. Being an observing  young man he at once noticed Dick's watch-chain.    \"Halloa, Hunter!\" said he; \"I didn't know you had a watch.\"    \"I didn't know it myself till last night,\" said Dick.    \"Where did you get it?\"    \"It came from Ball & Black's,\" said our hero, willing to mystify him.    \"That's a nice chain,--solid gold, eh?\"    \"Do you think I'd wear anything else?\" asked Dick, loftily.    \"Will you allow me to look at the watch?\"    \"Certainly,\" said Dick, drawing it from his pocket, and submitting it to  Clifton's inspection.    \"It's a regular beauty,\" said the young man, enthusiastically. \"Do you  mind telling how much you paid for it?\"    \"How much do you think?\"    \"A hundred dollars?\"    \"It cost all of that,\" said Dick, confidently. \"If you see one for sale  at that price, just let me know, and I'll buy it for a speculation.\"    \"You must be getting a pretty good salary to buy such a watch as that.\"    \"Pretty good,\" said Dick, carelessly.    Mr. Clifton was rather a shallow young man, who was fond of show, and  had a great respect for those who were able to make it. When Dick first  came to the boarding-house he looked down upon him as a boy; but now  that he proved to be the possessor of an elegant gold watch and chain,  and might, therefore, be regarded as in prosperous circumstances, he  conceived a high respect for him. The truth was that Clifton himself  only got two dollars a week more than Dick, yet he paid eight dollars a  week for board, and spent the rest in dress. His reputation among  tailors was not the best, being always more ready to order new clothes  than to pay for them.    While they were talking the rest of the boarders entered, and breakfast  commenced. Miss Peyton was there, of course.    \"How did you find your friends in Madison Avenue last evening, Mr.  Hunter?\" she inquired.    \"They were all up and dressed,\" said Dick. \"They sent their partic'lar  regards to you.\"    \"Oh, you wicked"]]]
