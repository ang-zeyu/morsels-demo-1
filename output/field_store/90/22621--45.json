Hush! Hark, a sweet voice rises clear!        A voice of earnestness intense,      \"If I have worshipped Thee in fear        And duly paid with reverence      The solemn sacrifices,--hear!        Send consolation, and thy peace      Eternal, to our parents dear,        That their anxieties may cease.      Oh, ever hath I loved Thy truth,        Therefore on Thee I dare to call,      Help us, this night, and them, for sooth        Without thy help, we perish all.\"        She took in hers Satyavan's hand,        She gently wiped his falling tears,      \"This weakness, Love, I understand!        Courage!\" She smiled away his fears.      \"Now we shall go, for thou art strong.\"        She helped him rise up by her side      And led him like a child along,        He, wistfully the basket eyed      Laden with fruit and flowers. \"Not now,        To-morrow we shall fetch it hence.\"      And so, she hung it on a bough,        \"I'll bear thy saw for our defence.\"        In one fair hand the saw she took,        The other with a charming grace      She twined around him, and her look        She turned upwards to his face.      Thus aiding him she felt anew        His bosom beat against her own--      More firm his step, more clear his view,        More self-possessed his words and tone      Became, as swift the minutes past,        And now the pathway he discerns,      And 'neath the trees, they hurry fast,        For Hope's fair light before them burns.        Under the faint beams of the stars        How beautiful appeared the flowers,      Light scarlet, flecked with golden bars        Of the palasas,[1] in the bowers      That Nature there herself had made        Without the aid of man. At times      Trees on their path cast densest shade,        And nightingales sang mystic rhymes      Their fears and sorrows to assuage.        Where two paths met, the north they chose,      As leading to the hermitage,        And soon before them, dim it rose.        Here let us end. For all may guess        The blind old king received his sight,      And ruled again with gentleness        The country that was his by right;      And that Savitri's royal sire        Was blest with many sons,--a race      Whom poets praised for martial fire,        And every peaceful gift and grace.      As for Savitri, to this day        Her name is named, when couples wed,      And to the bride the parents say,        Be thou like her, in heart and head.      [1] _Butea frondosa._          II.    LAKSHMAN.          \"Hark! Lakshman! Hark, again that cry!        It is,--it is my husband's voice!      Oh hasten, to his succour fly,        No more hast thou, dear friend, a choice.      He calls on thee, perhaps his foes        Environ him on all sides round,      That wail,--it means death's final throes!        Why standest thou, as magic-bound?        \"Is this a time for thought,--oh gird        Thy bright sword on, and take thy bow!      He heeds not, hears not any word,        Evil hangs over us, I know!      Swift in decision, prompt in deed,        Brave unto rashness, can this be,      The man to whom all looked at need?        Is it my brother, that I see!        \"Ah no, and I must run alone,        For further here I cannot stay;      Art thou transformed to blind dumb stone!        Wherefore this impious, strange delay!      That cry,--that cry,--it seems to ring        Still in my ears,--I cannot bear      Suspense; if help we fail to bring        His death at least we both can share.\"        \"Oh calm thyself, Videhan Queen,        No cause is there for any fear,      Hast thou his prowess never seen?        Wipe off for shame that dastard tear!      What being of demonian birth        Could ever brave his mighty arm?      Is there a creature on the earth        That dares to work our hero harm?        \"The lion and the grisly bear        Cower when they see his royal look,      Sun-staring eagles of the air        His glance of anger cannot brook,      Pythons and cobras at his tread        To their most secret coverts glide,      Bowed to the dust each serpent head        Erect before in hooded pride.        \"Rakshases, Danavs, demons, ghosts,        Acknowledge in their hearts his might,      And slink to their remotest coasts,        In terror at his very sight.      Evil to him! Oh fear it not,        Whatever foes against him rise!      Banish for aye, the foolish thought,        And be thyself,--bold, great, and wise.        \"He call for help! Canst thou believe        He like a child would shriek for aid      Or pray for respite or reprieve--        Not of such metal is he made!      Delusive was that piercing cry,--        Some trick of magic by the foe;      He has a work,--he cannot die,        Beseech me not from hence to go.        \"For here beside thee, as a guard        'Twas he commanded me to stay,      And dangers with my life to ward        If they should come across thy way.      Send me not hence, for in this wood        Bands scattered of the giants lurk,      Who on their wrongs and vengeance brood,        And wait the hour their will to work.\"        \"Oh shame! And canst thou make my weal        A plea for lingering! Now I know      What thou art Lakshman! And I feel        Far better were an open foe.      Art thou a coward? I have seen        Thy bearing in the battle-fray      Where flew the death-fraught arrows keen,        Else had I judged thee so to-day.        \"But then thy leader stood beside!        Dazzles the cloud when shines the sun,      Reft of his radiance, see it glide        A shapeless mass of vapours dun;      So of thy courage,--or if not,        The matter is far darker dyed,      What makes thee loth to leave this spot?        Is there a motive thou wouldst hide?        \"He perishes--well, let him die!        His wife henceforth shall be mine own!      Can that thought deep imbedded lie        Within thy heart's most secret zone!      Search well and see! one brother takes        His kingdom,--one would take his wife!      A fair partition!--But it makes        Me shudder, and abhor my life.        \"Art thou in secret league with those        Who from his hope the kingdom rent?      A spy from his ignoble foes        To track him in his banishment?      And wouldst thou at his death rejoice?        I know thou wouldst, or sure ere now      When first thou heardst that well-known voice        Thou shouldst have run to aid, I trow.        \"Learn this,--whatever comes may come,        But I shall not survive my Love,--      Of all my thoughts here is the sum!        Witness it gods in heaven above.      If fire can burn, or water drown,        I follow him:--choose what thou wilt,      Truth with its everlasting crown,        Or falsehood, treachery, and guilt.        \"Remain here, with a vain pretence        Of shielding me from wrong and shame,      Or go and die in his defence        And leave behind a noble name.      Choose what thou wilt,--I urge no more,        My pathway lies before me clear,      I did not know thy mind before,        I know thee now,--and have no fear.\"        She said and proudly from him turned,--        Was this the gentle Sita? No.      Flames from her eyes shot forth and burned,        The tears therein had ceased to flow.      \"Hear me, O Queen, ere I depart,        No longer can I bear thy words,      They lacerate my inmost heart        And torture me, like poisoned swords.        \"Have I deserved this at thine hand?        Of lifelong loyalty and truth      Is this the meed? I understand        Thy feelings, Sita, and in sooth      I blame thee not,--but thou mightst be        Less rash in judgement. Look! I go,      Little I care what comes to me        Wert thou but safe,--God keep thee so!        \"In going hence I disregard        The plainest orders of my chief,      A deed for me,--a soldier,--hard        And deeply painful, but thy grief      And language, wild and wrong, allow        No other course. Mine be the crime,      And mine alone,--but oh, do thou        Think better of me from this time.        \"Here with an arrow, lo, I trace        A magic circle ere I leave,      No evil thing within this space        May come to harm thee or to grieve.      Step not, for aught, across the line,        Whatever thou mayst see or hear,      So shalt thou balk the bad design        Of every enemy I fear.        \"And now farewell! What thou hast said,        Though it has broken quite my heart,      So that I wish that I were dead--        I would before, O Queen, we part      Freely forgive, for well I know        That grief and fear have made thee wild,      We part as friends,--is it not so?\"        And speaking thus,--he sadly smiled.        \"And oh ye sylvan gods that dwell        Among these dim and sombre shades,      Whose voices in the breezes swell        And blend with noises of cascades,      Watch over Sita, whom alone        I leave, and keep her safe from harm,      Till we return unto our own,        I and my brother, arm in arm.        \"For though ill omens round us rise        And frighten her dear heart, I feel      That he is safe. Beneath the skies        His equal is not,--and his heel      Shall tread all adversaries down,        Whoever they may chance to be.--      Farewell, O Sita! Blessings crown        And Peace for ever rest with thee!\"        He said, and straight his weapons took        His bow and arrows pointed keen,      Kind,--nay, indulgent,--was his look,        No trace of anger there was seen,      Only a sorrow dark, that seemed        To deepen his resolve to dare      All dangers. Hoarse the vulture screamed,        As out he strode with dauntless air.          III.    JOGADHYA UMA.          \"Shell-bracelets ho! Shell-bracelets ho!        Fair maids"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23259"],[0,"Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit (#7)"],[1,"under it and the leg severed at the  joint. A little corn meal sprinkled on the exposed flesh and the  operator's fingers will prevent the feathers adhering and becoming  soiled as the work proceeds.    Cut off the flesh in which the tail quills are rooted leaving it on the  skin with one or two of the last vertebrae. Use care in this or you will  cut the skin above the tail too. The body may now be hung up by a cord  tied to the stump of one of the legs and both hands used in separating  and turning the skin back until the wings are reached. The skin is  loosened around these and they may be severed at the elbow joint unless  the bird is to be mounted with wings spread, when it will be best to  unjoint at the shoulder and preserve the entire wing bones.    [Illustration: HOODED MERGANSER.]    With the wings detached we skin on to the base of the skull. In some of  the ducks, and other water birds, woodpeckers and owls the neck is so  slender and the skull so large that it is necessary to cut the neck off  here and making a cut down the back of the head and neck continue the  skinning of the head through it. Do not cut or tear the membrane of the  ears but pull it out with the forceps and work down over the eyes,  cutting the membrane connecting the skin but not the lids or eyeball  itself. The liquid contents of the eye are particularly sticky and  difficult to remove from feathers.    Continue skinning to the base of the bill, scoop the eyes from their  sockets and cut loose the forward part of the skull from the neck. This  is usually accomplished with four snips of the scissors much easier to  practice than to describe.    Make one cut on each side of the head, through the small bone connecting  the base of the lower jaw with the skull, another through the roof of  the mouth at the base of the upper mandible and between the jaws of the  lower, and the last through the skull behind the eyes and parallel with  the roof of the mouth. This will free the skull of the neck and most of  its flesh and muscle.    In most cases the head should be returned to the skin as soon as  possible to avoid its drying out of shape and giving the feathers a  wrong set. After cleaning and poisoning the skull and filling the eye  sockets with cotton this reversing is undertaken. If working on a small  bird the learner is apt to come to grief here, as only by careful and  patient work without the application of some force is the returning  process accomplished successfully.    The wings and legs may now be skinned down to the first joint and all  flesh and muscle removed from the bones. This is done expeditiously by  snipping off the end of the leg bone and stripping it down with adhering  flesh to the ankle joint where it (the flesh) is cut off.    The wings are skinned to the first joint, stripping the wing primary  feathers from their fastening on the bone with the thumb nail, clipping  off the large bone near the end and detaching the small bone with all  flesh and muscle adhering. If this is clipped off at the wrist joint the  entire wing is cleaned. This method applies to all small and medium  birds not wanted with spread wings.    [Illustration: OPENING CUT ON BIRD.    Opening and Cleaning Wing from Underneath For Spread Wing Mounting.]    In case wing spread is wanted the primary feathers are not disturbed but  that part of the wing is cleaned from a slit in the under side of the  wing. All but the smallest birds should have the tip joint of the wing  slit open on the under side and some form of preservative worked in the  opening. Specimens the size of a crow and larger should have a cut made  in the bottom of the foot and the tendons of the lower leg drawn out  with an awl, and in the case of very large birds it may be necessary to  soak the unfeathered part of the legs and feet in a pan of strong pickle  for 24 hours, to prevent decay and damage from insects. Our bird is now  entirely ready for the application of such preservatives as we may be  using.    The main principle in the preserving of skins may be stated thus: All  skins must be removed and cleaned of flesh so the preservative may be  applied to every part of the inner surface, where it will act directly  on the roots of the hair or feathers.    The preservative applied, we must decide on the next step, whether it is  to be mounted at once, in a short time, or laid away indefinitely as a  scientific skin.    If we have to lay it away until tomorrow, put a little cotton inside to  prevent the inner surface sticking together, wrap in a damp cloth and  unless the weather is very hot it will be all right.    If very hot or it is necessary to lay it aside for some days, the inner  side should be well coated with the carbolic and glycerine mixture. As a  scientific skin it should be made up at once, tagged with a full set of  measurements taken before skinning and laid aside to dry. These  measurements are not needed if we mount it at once, as the skinned body  is at hand for comparison, but the sex, date, locality and collector's  name should be attached to the completed specimen.    Alligators and the lizard family are skinned like the other four-footed  species, as are snakes and fish, with the exception they have no limb  bones to be cleaned and preserved. Fish are better opened along one side  than the central line of the body.    Reptile skins if not put in the pickle jar had better be packed in salt  after poisoning as when entirely dry they are practically ruined. Skins  of fish are best kept in either a saturated solution of salt (water with  salt added until no more will dissolve), alcohol or formaldehyde  solution. Whatever method is used the delicate colors will vanish and  unless you can have a fresh specimen at hand when mounting it you should  make the best color record you are able. This is true to some extent at  least of all coverings of fur, feathers, or scales, and the stronger the  light the more damage. I have seen a mounted mink placed in direct  sunshine, bleached to a drab and the yellow feathers on a 'flicker faded  almost white.    In order to preserve turtles, after killing with chloroform preferably,  it is necessary in the case of the box or land turtles to cut a square  opening in the under shell through which the body may be removed and the  legs and neck skinned.    The water species can have the lower shell detached from the upper at  the side and after cutting the skin around the rear two-thirds this  shell is turned over to the front and the skinning and cleaning  proceeded with.    If not mounted at once make into a dry skin after poisoning or small  turtles may be put in alcohol.          CHAPTER VII.    MAKING SCIENTIFIC SKINS.      Probably most bird skins which are not mounted at once are kept in the  form of \"scientific skins.\" In other words they are skinned, poisoned  and without wiring, given the shape of the dead bird. Their plumage,  size, etc., may be examined, they are easily packed or shipped and, if  properly made, may be mounted at any time but at the expenditure of  considerably more work than a freshly taken skin requires.    The instructions on skinning leaves us with the skin wrong side out with  the exception of possibly the head. The leg and wing bone, cleaned of  flesh, should be well poisoned as well as the skin and after wrapping  with pieces of cotton bat to their approximate size, returned to their  places. It is well when doing this to under rather than over fill.    Connect the bones of the wings with a bit of thread or cord. After  filling out around the eyes and upper throat, wind a small stick or  piece of wire with cotton to a size a little smaller than the natural  neck and push it into the opening at the back of skull.    The body can be filled out now with raw cotton, tow, or any similar  substance not of animal origin. Fine excelsior is about right for large  birds. The edges of the opening cut may be drawn together by a few  coarse stitches. After the feet have been tied together it is time to  adjust all the feathers become well rumpled in handling.    Our fingers, forceps and a setting needle made of a large needle or part  of a hat pin in a wooden handle will accomplish this. Stained or dirty  plumage should be cleaned before the skin is filled out, by first  sponging with tepid water, then with gasoline or benzine and drying with  plaster of paris or corn meal. Never apply this without the gasoline  first or you will have trouble indeed.    Now the skin is ready for its label, which should supply the following  information:    1. Length in inches from tip of tail to end of tail.    2. Distance between the tips of outstretched wings.    3. Length of wing from the first joint.    4. Color of eyes, feet, bill, etc.    5. Date, locality, collector.    6. The sex.    The first three items are often combined, in the case of a bluebird for  instance, 7-12-4, the order being understood.    Unless the plumage plainly indicates the sex this should be assured by  examination of the skinned body. By making an opening in the side of  this near the back bone the inside surface of the small of the back is  exposed. In the case of the male there will be visible two rounded  bodies, varying in size with the season and species, and in the female a  flattened mass of spheres.    After labeling and fastening the bill together with a pin or thread the  skin should be slipped inside a paper tube to dry. Water birds with long  slender necks should have the head bent around beside the body and the  long legs of waders are bent at the ankle and left resting on the body;  this to prevent breakage.    Duck, geese and any fat birds need the inside of the skins well scraped,  sponged with gasoline, partly filled with plaster paris and left for  several hours so all grease may be absorbed. This grease should be  removed prior to applying the preservative as it will prevent any  effectual penetration by the latter. "]]]
