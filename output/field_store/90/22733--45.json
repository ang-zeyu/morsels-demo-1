But the development of the mineral  resources of the country led to the appearance of a new factor in  South African politics. The comparative decline in the activity of the  High Commissioner had been accompanied by the establishment and growth  of powerful industrial corporations. It is easy to understand how a  man like Rhodes, with the wealth and influence of De Beers and the  Chartered Company at his command, might seek, by an alliance with the  \"great houses\" of the Rand, to find in private effort an instrument  for remedying the deficiencies of the Imperial Government even more  appropriate than the local governmental action upon which he had  previously relied. For the work of these industrial corporations had  powerfully enlisted the interest and sympathy of the British public.  The Jameson Raid was an illegitimate and disastrous application of an  otherwise meritorious and successful effort to strengthen the British  hold upon South Africa by private enterprise. It was at once the  measure of Imperial inefficiency, and its cure.    One other circumstance must be recalled in estimating the extent to  which the Home Government had earned the distrust of the British  population in South Africa. Only eighteen months[11] before the Raid  the High Commissioner, Lord Loch, had gone to Pretoria carrying a  despatch in which the grant of a five years' franchise was advocated  on behalf of the Uitlanders. His instructions were to present this  despatch, and press upon President Krueger personally the necessity for  giving effect to its recommendations. These instructions were  cancelled at the last moment by Lord Ripon, because the German  Ambassador had made representations in London that such action would  be regarded as an interference with the _status quo_ in South Africa,  and, as such, detrimental to German interests in that country. And six  months later[12] President Krueger, in attending a \"Kommers\" given by  the German Club at Pretoria in honour of the Kaiser Wilhelm II.'s  birthday, alluded to Germany as a grown-up power that would stop  England from \"kicking\" the child Republic.             [Footnote 11: June, 1894.]             [Footnote 12: January 28th, 1895.]    [Sidenote: Rhodes's Plan.]    The Raid was, therefore, a short cut to baffle German intrigue and  solve the problem of South African unity at one blow. For to Rhodes  the enfranchisement of the Uitlanders meant the withdrawal of the  Transvaal Government from its opposition to his scheme of commercial  federation. It is obvious that one ground of justification, and one  only, can be found for the usurpation of the functions of government  by a private individual, or group of individuals. This justification  is success. It has been the custom to represent Dr. Jameson's decision  to \"ride in\" as \"an act of monumental folly,\" alike from a political  and a military point of view. But this opinion overlooks the fact that  the affair may have been so planned in Rhodes's mind that success did  not depend upon the victory of the Uitlanders, aided by Jameson's  troopers, but on the presence of the High Commissioner in the  Transvaal under such conditions as would make the intervention of the  Imperial Government at once imperative and effectual. The  representative of the Imperial Government, backed by a Johannesburg in  armed revolt against the Boer oligarchy, would find himself--so Rhodes  thought--in a position highly favourable to the successful prosecution  of the demands which had already been put forward on behalf of  British subjects resident in the Transvaal. And in order that this  essential part of the plan might be carried out without a moment of  unnecessary delay, Rhodes kept a train, with steam up, in the station  at Capetown ready to speed Lord Rosmead northwards directly the news  of Dr. Jameson's arrival at Johannesburg should have reached him. Once  Jameson's force had \"got through,\" he relied upon the Reform  Committee, however incomplete its preparations, being able to hold  Johannesburg for a couple of days against any force the Boers could  bring.[13] Nor in the light of what happened, during the war, both at  Mafeking and Kimberley, can this expectation be thought extravagant.  Here his responsibilities would have ended. The High Commissioner and  the Imperial Government would have done the rest. To indulge in  metaphor, the Imperial locomotive was to be set going, but the lines  on which it was to run were those laid down by Mr. Rhodes.             [Footnote 13: It is worth noticing that even the presence of           the German Marines at Delagoa Bay was           counterbalanced--whether by chance or design--by the           coincidence of the arrival of a British troopship with           time-expired men from the Indian garrison, off Durban.]    If this was the essence of Rhodes's plan, it would matter  comparatively little whether the Reformers had, or had not, completed  their preparations, or whether Dr. Jameson had 1,200 or 500 men.  Certainly some such assumption is necessary to account for the fact  that Rhodes treated his confederates at Johannesburg as so many pawns  on a chess-board. It is equally necessary to account for Dr. Jameson's  action. \"Twenty years friends, and now he goes in and ruins me,\" was  Rhodes's comment on the news that Dr. Jameson had \"ridden in,\" in  spite of his own orders to the contrary and the message to the same  effect which Captain Heany had delivered on behalf of the Reformers.  But what if Dr. Jameson knew, or thought that he knew, that Rhodes's  object in forcing the insurrection was not to make the Uitlanders  reduce Krueger, but to compel the Imperial Government to step in? In  this case he may well have thought that what was essential was not  that the rising should be successful, but that there should be a  rising of any kind; provided that it was sufficiently grave to arrest  the attention of the world, and claim the interference of the Imperial  Government.    According to Mr. Chamberlain the continued inaction of the Imperial  Government in the eighteen months that had passed since Lord Loch's  visit to Pretoria in June, 1894, was due to two circumstances. In the  first place, \"the Uitlanders and their organs had always deprecated  the introduction into the dispute of what is called in South Africa  the 'Imperial factor'\"; and in the second, the \"rumours\" of violent  measures \"were continually falsified by the event.\" Obviously, if  Rhodes forced an insurrection with the intention of removing these  obstacles--if, that is to say, the intervention of the Imperial  Government, and not the success of the insurrection, was his primary  object--the temerity of Dr. Jameson's invasion is materially  diminished. Now Mr. Chamberlain's statement, made under date February  4th, 1896, _i.e._ five weeks after the Raid, is perfectly consistent  with the view of the attitude of the Reformers expressed by Rhodes on  the day before the Raid took place.    [Sidenote: The reformers divided.]    Dr. Jameson's force, it will be remembered, started on the evening of  Sunday, December 29th, 1895. Up to three days before--the  26th--nothing had occurred to interfere with the final arrangement,  telegraphed to Dr. Jameson from Capetown, that the movement in  Johannesburg would take place on Saturday, the 28th. The circumstances  which caused the Reformers to alter their plans were explained by  Rhodes in an interview with Sir Graham Bower, the Imperial Secretary,  at Capetown on the same Saturday, the 28th, with his accustomed  vivacity. The Johannesburg insurrection, he said--         \"had fizzled out as a damp squib. The capitalists financing the       movement had made the hoisting of the British flag a _sine qua       non_. This the National Union rejected, and issued a manifesto       declaring for a republic. The division had led to the complete       collapse of the movement, and it was thought that the leaders       would make the best terms they could with President Krueger.\"    The telegrams which reached Dr. Jameson between the 26th and 29th  contained the same facts, with the further information that Captain  Heany was travelling by special train to him with a message direct  from the Reformers. In these circumstances it is said that Rhodes at  Capetown imagined as little as the Reform leaders at Johannesburg that  Dr. Jameson would cross the frontier. That, however, there was another  point of view from which the situation might present itself to Dr.  Jameson is shown by the fact that Mr. Chamberlain, in reply to the  High Commissioner's telegram reporting the substance of Rhodes's  statement to Sir Graham Bower, at once[14] inquired of Lord Rosmead,  \"Are you sure Jameson has not moved in consequence of the collapse?\"             [Footnote 14: Afternoon of Monday, December 30th.]    Was Mr. Chamberlain right? Did Dr. Jameson see in the fact that the  Reformers were divided on such an issue only an additional reason for  carrying out a plan which had for its object to compel the Imperial  Government to intervene in the affairs of the Transvaal before it was  too late; that is to say, before the British population had definitely  committed itself to the policy of a purged republic, but a republic  under any flag but that of Great Britain? Such a policy was not merely  possible. It seemed inevitable to the vivacious French observer who  wrote, not from hearsay, but \"with his eyes upon the object,\" in  December, 1893:         \"The Transvaal will never be an English colony. The English of       the Transvaal, as well as those of Cape Colony and Natal, would       be as firmly opposed to it as the Boers themselves, for they have       never forgiven"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26500"],[0,"Anecdotes of Dogs (#7)"],[1,"says:--    \"The natural sagacity and talents of the dog are well known, and  justly celebrated. But when these are improved by association with  man, and by education, he becomes, in some measure, a rational being.  The senses of the dog, particularly that of scenting distant objects,  give him a superiority over every other quadruped. He reigns at the  head of a flock; and his language, whether expressive of blandishment  or of command, is better heard and better understood than the voice of  his master. Safety, order, and discipline, are the effects of his  vigilance and activity. Sheep and cattle are his subjects. These he  conducts and protects with prudence and bravery, and never employs  force against them except for the preservation of peace and good  order. But when in pursuit of his prey, he makes a complete display of  his courage and intelligence. In this situation both natural and  acquired talents are exerted. As soon as the horn or voice of the  hunter is heard, the dog demonstrates his joy by the most expressive  emotions and accents. By his movements and cries he announces his  impatience for combat, and his passion for victory. Sometimes he moves  silently along, reconnoitres the ground, and endeavours to discover  and surprise the enemy. At other times he traces the animal's steps,  and by different modulations of voice, and by the movements,  particularly of his tail, indicates the distance, the species, and  even the age of the fugitive deer. All these movements and  modifications of voice are perfectly understood by experienced  hunters. When he wishes to get into an apartment he comes to the door;  if that is shut, he scratches with his foot, makes a bewailing noise,  and, if his petition is not soon answered, he barks with a peculiar  and humble voice. The shepherd's dog not only understands the language  of his master, but, when too distant to be heard, he knows how to act  by signals made with the hand.\"    Mr. Brockedon, in his \"Journal of Excursions in the Alps,\" says:--\"In  these valleys, the early hours of retirement placed us in the  difficult situation of fighting our way to the inn door at Lanslebourg  against a magnificent Savoyard dog, who barked and howled defiance at  our attempts, for which he stood some chance of being shot. At length  a man, hearing our threats, popped his head out of a window, and  entreated our forbearance. We were soon admitted, and refreshments  amply provided. I had heard a story of a duel fought here from Mr.  N----, in which he was a principal, about a dog; and upon inquiry  learnt that this was the same animal. A party of four young officers,  returning from Genoa, stopped here. Mr. N---- had brought with him a  beautiful little pet dog, which had been presented to him by a lady on  his leaving Genoa. Struck by the appearance of the fine dog at the  inn, one of the officers bought it. He was fairly informed that the  dog had been already sold to an Englishman, who had taken it as far as  Lyons, where the dog escaped, and returned (two hundred miles) to  Lanslebourg. The officer who made the purchase intended to fasten it  in the same place with the little dog. This Mr. N---- objected to;  when his brother-officer made some offensive allusions to the lady  from whom the pet had been received. An apology was demanded, and  refused. Swords were instantly drawn; they fought in the room. Mr.  N---- wounded and disarmed his antagonist; an apology for the  injurious reflections followed, and the party proceeded to England.  The dog was taken safely as far as Paris, where he again escaped, and  returned home (five hundred miles). I was now informed that the dog  had been sold a third time to an Englishman; and again, in spite of  precautions having been taken, he had returned to Lanslebourg from  Calais.\"    A Scotch grazier, named Archer, having lost his way, and being  benighted, at last got to a lone cottage; where, on his being  admitted, a dog which had left Archer's house four years before  immediately recognised him, fawned upon him, and when he retired for  the night followed him into the chamber where he was to lie, and  there, by his gestures, induced him narrowly to examine it; and then  Archer saw sufficient to assure him that he was in the house of  murderers. Rendered desperate by the terrors of his situation, he  burst into the room where the banditti were assembled, and wounded his  insidious host by a pistol-shot; and in the confusion which the sudden  explosion occasioned, he opened the door; and, notwithstanding he was  fired at, accompanied by his dog Brutus, exerted all the speed which  danger could call forth until daylight, which enabled him to perceive  a house, and the main road, at no great distance. Upon his arrival at  the house, and telling the master of it his story, he called up some  soldiers that were there quartered, and who, by the aid of the dog,  retraced the way back to the cottage. Upon examining the building a  trap-door was found, which opened into a place where, amongst the  mangled remains of several persons, was the body of the owner, who had  received the shot from the grazier's pistol in his neck; and although  not dead, had been, by the wretches his associates, in their quick  retreat, thrown into this secret cemetery. He was, however, cured of  his wound, delivered up to justice, tried, and executed.[A]    A merchant had received a large sum of money; and being fatigued with  riding in the heat of the day, had retired to repose himself in the  shade; and upon remounting his horse, had forgotten to take up the bag  which contained the money. His dog tried to remind his master of his  inadvertency by crying and barking, which so surprised the merchant,  that, in crossing a brook, he observed whether the dog drank, as he  had his suspicions of his being mad; and which were confirmed by the  dog's not lapping any water, and by his increased barking and howling,  and at length by his endeavouring to bite the heels of the horse.  Impressed with the idea of the dog's madness, to prevent further  mischief, he discharged his pistol at him, and the dog fell. After  riding some distance with feelings that will arise in every generous  breast at the destruction of an affectionate animal, he discovered  that his money was missing. His mind was immediately struck that the  actions of the dog, which his impetuosity had construed into madness,  were only efforts to remind him of his loss. He galloped back to where  he had fired his pistol; but the dog was gone from thence with equal  expedition to the spot where he had reposed. But what were the  merchant's feelings when he perceived his faithful dog, in the  struggles of death, lying by the side of the bag which had been  forgotten! The dog tried to rise, but his strength was exhausted. He  stretched out his tongue to lick the hand that was now fondling him  with all the agony of regret for the wound its rashness had inflicted,  and casting a look of kindness on his master, closed his eyes for  ever.[B]    I am indebted to a well-known sportsman for the following interesting  account of some of his dogs. It affords another proof how much  kindness will do in bringing out the instinctive faculties of these  animals; and that, when properly educated, their sense, courage, and  attachment are most extraordinary.    \"Smoaker was a deer greyhound of the largest size, but of his pedigree  I know nothing. In speed he was equal to any hare greyhound; at the  same time, in spirit he was indomitable. He was the only dog I ever  knew who was a match for a red stag, single-handed. From living  constantly in the drawing-room, and never being separated from me, he  became acquainted with almost the meaning of every word--certainly of  every sign. His retrieving of game was equal to any of the retrieving  I ever saw in any other dogs. He would leap over any of the most  dangerous spikes at a sign, walk up and come down any ladder, and  catch, without hurting it, any particular fowl out of a number that  was pointed out to him. If he missed me from the drawing-room, and had  doubts about my being in the house, he would go into the hall and look  for my hat: if he found it, he would return contented; but if he did  not find it, he would proceed up-stairs to a window at the very top of  the house, and look from the window each way, to ascertain if I were  in sight. One day in shooting at Cranford, with his late Royal  Highness the Duke of York, a pheasant fell on the other side of the  stream. The river was frozen over; but in crossing to fetch the  pheasant the ice broke, and let Smoaker in, to some inconvenience. He  picked up the pheasant, and instead of trying the ice again, he took  it many hundred yards round to the bridge. Smoaker died at the great  age of eighteen years. His son Shark was also a beautiful dog. He was  by Smoaker out of a common greyhound bitch, called Vagrant, who had  won a cup at Swaffham. Shark was not so powerful as Smoaker; but he  was, nevertheless, a large-sized dog, and was a first-rate deer  greyhound and retriever. He took his father's place on the rug, and  was inseparable from me. He was educated and entered at deer under  Smoaker. When Shark was first admitted to the house, it chanced that  one day he and Smoaker were left alone in a room with a table on which  luncheon was laid. Smoaker might have been left for hours with meat on  the table, and he would have died rather than have touched it; but at  that time Shark was not proof against temptation. I left the room to  hand some lady to her carriage, and as I returned by the window, I  looked in. Shark was on his legs, smelling curiously round the table;  whilst Smoaker had risen to a sitting posture, his ears pricked, his  brow frowning, and his eyes intently fixed on his son's actions. After  tasting several viands, Shark's long nose came in contact with about  half a cold tongue; the morsel was"]]]
