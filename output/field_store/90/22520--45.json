Of all days, Sunday at Stonebridge House was the most miserable and  desperate.  We had not even the occupation of lessons, still less the  escape to the playground.  After church, we were marched back to the  school, and there set to read some dry task book till dinner.    And after dinner we were set to copy out a chapter of Jeremiah or some  other equally suitable passage from beginning to end on ruled paper,  getting bad marks as on week days for all faults.  After this came tea,  and after tea another dreary march forth to church.  But the culminating  horror of the day was yet to come.  After evening church--and there  really was a sense of escape and peace in the old church, even though we  could not make out the sermon--after evening church, we were all taken  up to Miss Henniker's parlour, and there doomed to sit perfectly still  for a whole hour, while she read aloud something by one of the very old  masters.  Oh, the agony of those Sunday evenings!    I have sat fascinated by that awful voice, with a cramp in my leg that I  dared not stir to relieve, or a tickling in the small of my back from  which there was no escape, or a cobweb on my face I had not the courage  to brush away.  I have felt sleep taking possession of me, yet daring  neither to yawn, nor nod my head, nor wink my eyes.  I have stared  fixedly at the gas, or the old china ornament on the mantelpiece, till  my eyes became watery with the effort and I have suffered all the  tortures of a cold in the head without the possibility either of  sniffing or clearing my throat!    It made no difference to Miss Henniker that she was reading aloud.  She  had her eye on every one of us the whole time, nay, more than ever; and  many a bad mark was sprinkled up with her readings.    \"Once more, dearly beloved--Batchelor, a bad mark,\" became to me quite a  familiar sound before I had been many Sundays at Stonebridge House.    This particular Sunday evening I thought I should go mad, at least,  during the first part of the performance.  I _couldn't_ sit still, and  the more I tried the more restless I became.  At last, however, some  chance directed my eyes to where the new boy was sitting in a distant  corner of the room, and from that moment, I can't tell why, I became a  model of quiet sitting.  I found myself forgetting all about the  cobwebs, and Mrs Hudson, and the china ornament, and the small of my  back, and thinking of nothing but this solemn, queer boy, with his big  eyes, and black hair, and troubled face.  The more I looked at him the  more sorry I felt for him, and the more I wished to be his friend.  I  would--    \"Batchelor, repeat the last words I read,\" broke in Miss Henniker.    She thought she had me, but no!  Far away as my thoughts had been, my  ears had mechanically retained those last melodious strains, and I  answered, promptly, \"Latitudinarianism of an unintelligent  emotionalism!\"    One to me!  And I returned to my brown study triumphant, and pretty  secure against further molestation.    I made up my mind, come what would, I would speak to the new boy and let  him see _I_ was not against him.    Some one will smile, of course, and say, sarcastically, \"What a treat  for the new boy!\"  But if he only knew with what fear and trembling I  made that resolution, he would acquit Fred Batchelor of any very great  self-importance in the matter.    Bedtime came at last, and, thankful to have the day over, we crawled  away to our roosts.  The new boy's bed, as I have said, was next mine,  and I conceived the determination, if I could only keep awake, of  speaking to him after every one was asleep.    It was hard work that keeping awake; but I managed it.  Gradually, one  after another dropped off, and the padding footsteps overhead and the  voices below died away till nothing was heard but the angry tick of the  clock outside and the regular breathing of the sleepers on every hand.    Then I softly slid out of bed and crawled on my hands and knees to  Smith's bed.  It was an anxious moment for me.  He might be asleep, and  wake up in a fright to find some one near him; or he might be awake and  resent my intrusion.  Still I determined I _would_ go to him, and I was  rewarded.    \"Is that Batchelor?\"  I heard him whisper as I approached his bed.    \"Yes,\" I answered, joyfully, and feeling half the battle over.    \"Come in,\" said he, moving to make room for me.    \"Oh no!\"  I said, in terror at the very idea.  \"Suppose I fell asleep.  I'll kneel here, and then if any one comes I can crawl back.\"    \"What is it?\"  Smith said, presently, after a long and awkward pause.    I was thankful that he broke the ice.    \"Oh,\" I whispered, \"aren't you jolly miserable here, I say?\"    \"Pretty!\" said he.  \"Aren't you?\"    \"Oh, yes!  But the fellows are all so unkind to you.\"    Smith gave a little bitter laugh.  \"That doesn't matter,\" he said.    \"Doesn't it?  I wish I was bigger, I'd back you up--and so will  Flanagan, if you let him.\"    \"Thanks, old man!\" said the new boy, putting his hand on my arm.  \"It's  not the fellows I mind, it's--\" and here he pulled up.    \"Old Henniker,\" I put in, in accents of smothered rage.    \"Ugh!\" said Smith; \"she's awful!\"    But somehow it occurred to me the Henniker was not what Smith was going  to say when he pulled up so suddenly just before.  I felt certain there  was something mysterious about him, and of course, being a boy, I burned  to know.    However, he showed no signs of getting back to that subject, and we  talked about a lot of things, thankful to have scope for once for our  pent-up feelings.  It was one of the happiest times I had known for  years, as I knelt there on the hard carpetless floor and found my heart  going out to the heart of a friend.  What we talked about was of little  moment; it was probably merely about boys' trifles, such as any boy  might tell another.  What was of moment was that there, in dreary,  cheerless Stonebridge House, we had found some interest in common, and  some object for our spiritless lives.    I told him all about home and my uncle, in hopes that he would be  equally communicative, but here he disappointed me.    \"Are your father and mother dead too?\"  I said.    \"Not both,\" he replied.    It was spoken in a tone half nervous, half vexed, so I did not try to  pursue the subject.    Presently he changed the subject and said, \"How do you like that fellow  Hawkesbury?\"    \"Not much; though I don't know why.\"    Smith put out his hand and pulled my face close to his as he whispered,  \"I hate him!\"    \"Has he been bullying you?\"  I inquired.    \"No,\" said Smith.  \"But he's--ugh--I don't know any more than you do why  I hate him.  I say, shall you be out in the playground to-morrow?\"    \"Yes, unless I get four bad marks before.  I've two against me already.\"    \"Oh, don't get any more.  I want to go for a walk.\"    \"A walk!\"  I exclaimed.  \"You'll never be allowed!\"    \"But we might slip out just for a few minutes; it's awful never to get  out.\"    It _was_ awful; but the risk.  However, I had promised to back him up,  and so I said where he went I would go.    \"If it was only to climb one tree, or see just one bird on the bushes,\"  he said, almost pathetically.  \"But I say, ain't you getting cold?\"    I was not, I protested, and for a long time more we continued talking.  Then at last the creaking of a board, or the noise of a mouse, startled  us in earnest, and in a moment I had darted back to my bed.  All was  quiet again.    \"Good-night, old boy,\" I whispered.    \"Good-night, old man.  Awfully good of you,\" he replied.  \"I'll come to  you to-morrow.\"    And not long after we were both sound asleep.    I managed to keep down my bad marks below four next day, so that I was  able once more to take my walks abroad in the playground.    It was with a little feeling of misgiving that I sallied forth, for  Smith was at my side, reminding me of our resolution to escape, if only  for a few minutes, to the free country outside.  I would greatly have  preferred not trying it, but Smith was set on it, and I had not the face  to leave him in the lurch.    The far end of the playground, beyond the swings, broke into a patch of  tangled thicket, beyond which again a little ditch separated the grounds  of Stonebridge House from the country outside.    To this thicket, therefore, we wandered, after \"showing ourselves\" on  the swings for a few minutes, for the sake of allaying suspicions.  The  other fellows were most of them loafing about on the far side of the  gravel yard, where the marble holes were; so we managed to make our  escape pretty easily, and found ourselves at length standing on the  breezy heath.  Once there, Smith's whole manner changed to one of wild  delight.  The sense of freedom seemed to intoxicate him, and the  infection seized me too.  We scampered about in a perfectly ridiculous  manner; up hills and down hollows, leaping over bushes, chasing one  another, and, in fact, behaving exactly like two kids (as we were),  suddenly let loose from confinement.    \"I say,\" said I, all out of breath, \"suppose we run clean away, Smith?\"    Smith pulled up in the middle of a scamper, and looked up and down on  every side.  Then the old solemn look came as he replied, \"Where to,  that's it?\"    \"Oh, Brownstroke, if you like; or your home.  Let's turn up, you know,  and give them a jolly surprise.\"    Smith's face clouded over as he said, hurriedly, \"I say, it's time to be  going back, or we shall get caught.\"    This was an effectual damper to any idea of flight, and we quickly  turned back once more to Stonebridge House.    We found our gap all right, and strolled back past the swings and up the  gravel walk as unconcernedly as possible, fully believing no one had  been witness of our escapade.  We were wrong.    Hawkesbury came up to us as we neared the house, with the usual smile on  his face.    \"Didn't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21059"],[0,"The Adventures of Dick Maitland: A Tale of Unknown Africa (#7)"],[1,"Jack  has done a hand's turn of work on board her.  Dick listened with a good-  tempered grin to the chorus of grumbling that was proceeding around him,  interjected a merry jest or two which caused the growlers to stop in  mid-career in amazement at his audacity, and then, having slipped nimbly  into his clothes, he sprang up through the hatchway and presented  himself first on deck of the forecastle hands, to be greeted by the mate  with a cheery:    \"Well done, youngster!  First to answer the call.  That comes of joining  your ship with an unmuddled brain.  I think you and I are going to get  on well together.\"    \"I sincerely hope so, sir,\" answered Dick.  \"If we don't it shall not be  my fault.  And although I am rather an ignoramus at present in respect  of a sailor's work generally, you will find me both willing and eager to  learn.\"    The mate stared at Dick for a moment with compressed eyebrows, rather  taken aback at the lad's refined tone and manner of speech; then he  nodded, and remarked gruffly:    \"That's all right; if you are willing to learn I'll take care that you  have the chance.  And, as a starter, you may get a broom and sweep up  all this litter.  But don't heave it overboard, or you'll have the dock  people after you.  Sweep it all together and put it into that empty  barrel until we get out of dock and can heave it over the side.\"    The rest of the forecastle hands now came stumbling up on deck, and were  set by the mate to various tasks, pending the opening of the dock gates  and the arrival of the tug which was to tow the _Concordia_ down the  river.  At length the order was given to unmoor ship, the dock gates  swung open, the vessel was warped through the opening to where the tug  awaited her, the towrope was passed, and presently the _Concordia_ was  heading down the river toward Gravesend, from whence, having first  shipped her passengers, she was to take her final departure for the  southern hemisphere.    The _Concordia_ was a steel barque of eight hundred and seventy-four  tons register, Clyde built, and modelled upon lines that combined a very  fair cargo-carrying capacity with high speed possibilities.  She was a  very handsome vessel to look at, and Captain William Roberts, who had  commanded her since she left the stocks some two years prior to the date  at which we make his and her acquaintance, was inordinately proud of  her, sparing no pains either to himself or his ship's crew--and  especially, his boatswain--to keep her as trim and neat as a man-o'-war.  The decks were regularly holystoned every morning when the ship was at  sea--to the intense disgust of the crew--the brasswork was as regularly  polished, not with the usual rottenstone and oil, but with special metal  polish provided out of the skipper's private purse; and there was no  more certain way of \"putting the Old Man's back up\" than for a man to  allow himself to be seen knocking the ashes of his pipe out against any  portion of the ship's painted work.  It was even asserted of Captain  Roberts that, so anxious was he to maintain the smart appearance of the  ship, he would, whenever she ran into a calm, have the quarterboat  lowered and manned, in order that he might pull round his vessel and  assure himself that her masts were all accurately stayed to precisely  the same angle of rake; and woe betide the unhappy boatswain if there  seemed to be the slightest occasion for fault-finding.    The _Concordia_ was a beamy ship in proportion to her length, and she  carried a full poop extending forward to within about twenty feet of her  mainmast, underneath which was a handsome saloon, or cuddy, fitted with  berth accommodation for twenty passengers; for although the steam liners  have, for all practical purposes, absorbed the passenger traffic, there  still remains a small residue of the travelling public who, either for  health or economy's sake, choose a well-found, well-built sailing  clipper when they desire to make a sea voyage.    Such was the vessel in which young Dick Maitland was to make his first,  and, as he hoped, his only, essay as a seaman before the mast, and after  the slight sketch which has been given of her and her skipper, it will  be readily seen that he could scarcely have hit upon a craft where he  would be likely to have more hard work, or better opportunities for the  acquirement of a large measure of seafaring knowledge in a very short  time.    Mr Sutcliffe, the chief mate, had been favourably impressed by Dick  from the moment when the two had encountered each other at the shipping  office, and Mr Sutcliffe's method of showing his favour was to provide  his favourites with an ample sufficiency of work to do.  The ship had,  therefore, not been out of dock half an hour when Dick was sent aloft  with an able seaman named Barrett to get the fore and main royal-yards  across; and so eager was the lad to learn as much as he could that  Barrett very willingly permitted him to do all the work, merely  directing him what to do and how to do it, and at the same time  instructing him as to the nomenclature and purposes of the various parts  of the gear which were manipulated during the operation.  Naturally,  Dick, being a novice, took about twice as long as his companion would  have taken over the job; but so eager was he to learn and such aptitude  did he exhibit that he won the unqualified approval of Barrett, as well  as of Mr Sutcliffe, who had been keeping a sharp eye upon what was  going on aloft.  As for Dick, although it was the first time that he had  ever been aloft in anything deserving the name of a ship, and although  the hull upon which he looked down seemed ridiculously inadequate to  support the lofty spar upon which he was working--suggesting the idea  that unless he exercised the utmost caution in the disposition of his  weight he must inevitably capsize the entire complicated structure--he  felt neither giddy nor nervous, but went about his work with all the  coolness and confidence of a thoroughly seasoned hand.    Arrived off Gravesend, the anchor was let go, and the ship swung to the  now fast ebbing tide, the quarterboat was lowered, and the skipper was  rowed ashore, while Mr Sutcliffe went the rounds of the decks and  satisfied himself that everything had been done to make the _Concordia_  perfectly ready to get under way at a moment's notice; the yards were  accurately squared by the lifts and braces, the running gear hauled taut  and neatly coiled down, the decks once more swept; and then the worthy  mate found himself compelled to admit, with a sigh, that nothing more  could be done, at least to advantage, until the passengers should have  come off and the ship be once more under way.  These two events happened  late in the afternoon, and meanwhile the occupants of the forecastle  were sent below to snatch a few hours' rest in preparation for the  coming night, during which Dick Maitland had an opportunity to become  better acquainted with his messmates.  For a wonder these proved to be  without exception British, consisting of two Irishmen, five Scotchmen,  and one Welshman, while the rest were English.  There was nothing very  remarkable about any of them, they were all just ordinary average  sailormen, but it did not take Dick very long to make up his mind that,  with the possible exception of the carpenter, and Barrett, the A.B. who  had been his companion and instructor aloft during the morning, the five  Scotchmen were the pick of the bunch.  But all hands seemed to be very  decent fellows in their own rough way, now that they had had time to  recover from their previous day's debauch, and manifested a distinct  disposition to be friendly toward the young greenhorn whom they found in  their midst, especially as they had already had an opportunity to see  that the greenhorn's greenness was not of such a character as to entail  upon them very much extra work.    The afternoon was well advanced when at length the passengers, seventeen  in number, came off to the ship; and the moment that they and their  baggage were embarked the anchor was hove up, the tug once more came  alongside and took the towrope, and the _Concordia_ proceeded upon her  voyage, the hope being freely expressed, both fore and aft, that there  would be no more anchoring until the ship should have arrived under the  shadow, so to speak, of Natal Bluff.  As soon as the ship was fairly  under way, and the anchor at the cathead, the chief and second mates  picked the watches, and Dick, to his satisfaction, found himself picked  by Mr Sutcliffe as a member of that officer's watch.    As the ship drew down toward the lower reaches of the river she met a  slight breeze breathing out from the north-east, to which she spread,  first, her fore-and-aft canvas, and, later on, her square sails, so that  by the time of her arrival off Deal, near midnight, she was practically  independent of the tug, which at that point cast her off.  Here also the  pilot left her, taking with him a goodly packet of letters from the  passengers to their friends ashore; and the _Concordia_, spreading her  studding-sails, swept on into the broadening waters of the English  Channel.  With the other letters went one from Dick to his mother and  another to Dr Humphreys, written during his watch below.    The fair wind which the _Concordia_ fell in with at the mouth of the  Thames lasted long enough to carry the ship, not only clear of the  Channel, but also well to the westward of Ushant, Captain Roberts having  availed himself to the utmost of the opportunity to make as much westing  as possible, as his experience had taught him that at that season of the  year the prevailing winds which he might expect to meet with to the  northward of Madeira would most probably be strong from the south-  westward.  And the event proved the correctness of that mariner's  surmise, for on his seventh day out from Gravesend he fell in with "]]]
