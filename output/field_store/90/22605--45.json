Young Wringhim only knew the full purport of this spiritual song; and  went to his bed better satisfied than ever that his father and brother  were castaways, reprobates, aliens from the Church and the true faith,  and cursed in time and eternity.    The next day George and his companions met as usual--all who were not  seriously wounded of them. But, as they strolled about the city, the  rancorous eye and the finger of scorn was pointed against them. None of  them was at first aware of the reason; but it threw a damp over their  spirits and enjoyments, which they could not master. They went to take  a forenoon game at their old play of tennis, not on a match, but by way  of improving themselves; but they had not well taken their places till  young Wringhim appeared in his old station, at his brother's right  hand, with looks more demure and determined than ever. His lips were  primmed so close that his mouth was hardly discernible, and his dark  deep eye flashed gleams of holy indignation on the godless set, but  particularly on his brother. His presence acted as a mildew on all  social intercourse or enjoyment; the game was marred, and ended ere  ever it was well begun. There were whisperings apart--the party  separated, and, in order to shake off the blighting influence of this  dogged persecutor, they entered sundry houses of their acquaintances,  with an understanding that they were to meet on the Links for a game at  cricket.    They did so; and, stripping off part of their clothes, they began that  violent and spirited game. They had not played five minutes till  Wringhim was stalking in the midst of them, and totally impeding the  play. A cry arose from all corners of: \"Oh, this will never do. Kick  him out of the play-ground! Knock down the scoundrel; or bind him, and  let him lie in peace.\"    \"By no means,\" cried George. \"It is evident he wants nothing else. Pray  do not humour him so much as to touch him with either foot or finger.\"  Then, turning to a friend, he said in a whisper: \"Speak to him, Gordon;  he surely will not refuse to let us have the ground to ourselves, if  you request it of him.\"    Gordon went up to him, and requested of him, civilly, but ardently, \"to  retire to a certain distance, else none of them could or would be  answerable, however sore he might be hurt.\"    He turned disdainfully on his heel, uttered a kind of pulpit hem! and  then added, \"I will take my chance of that; hurt me, any of you, at  your peril.\"    The young gentlemen smiled, through spite and disdain of the dogged  animal. Gordon followed him up, and tried to remonstrate with him; but  he let him know that \"it was his pleasure to be there at that time;  and, unless he could demonstrate to him what superior right he and his  party had to that ground, in preference to him, and to the exclusion of  all others, he was determined to assert his right, and the rights of  his fellow-citizens, by keeping possession of whatsoever part of that  common field he chose.\"    \"You are no gentleman, Sir,\" said Gordon.    \"Are you one, Sir?\" said the other.    \"Yes, Sir. I will let you know that I am, by G--!\"    \"Then, thanks be to Him whose name you have profaned, I am none, If one  of the party be a gentleman, I do hope in God am not!\"    It was now apparent to them all that he was courting obloquy and manual  chastisement from their hands, if  by any means he could provoke them  to the deed; and, apprehensive that he had some sinister and deep-laid  design in hunting after such a singular favour, they wisely restrained  one another from inflicting the punishment that each of them yearned to  bestow, personally, and which he so well deserved.    But the unpopularity of the younger George Colwan could no longer be  concealed from his associates. It was manifested wherever the populace  were assembled; and his young and intimate friend, Adam Gordon, was  obliged to warn him of the circumstance that he might not be surprised  at the gentlemen of their acquaintance withdrawing themselves from his  society, as they could not be seen with him without being insulted.  George thanked him; and it was agreed between them that the former  should keep himself retired during the daytime while he remained in  Edinburgh, and that at night they should meet together, along with such  of their companions as were disengaged.    George found it every day more and more necessary to adhere to this  system of seclusion; for it was not alone the hisses of the boys and  populace that pursued him--a fiend of more malignant aspect was ever at  his elbow, in the form of his brother. To whatever place of amusement  he betook himself, and however well he concealed his intentions of  going there from all flesh living, there was his brother Wringhim also,  and always within a few yards of him, generally about the same  distance, and ever and anon darting looks at him that chilled his very  soul. They were looks that cannot be described; but they were felt  piercing to the bosom's deepest core. They affected even the onlookers  in a very particular manner, for all whose eyes caught a glimpse of  these hideous glances followed them to the object towards which they  were darted: the gentlemanly and mild demeanour of that object  generally calmed their startled apprehensions; for no one ever yet  noted the glances of the young man's eye, in the black coat, at the  face of his brother, who did not at first manifest strong symptoms of  alarm.    George became utterly confounded; not only at the import of this  persecution, but how in the world it came to pass that this  unaccountable being knew all his motions, and every intention of his  heart, as it were intuitively. On consulting his own previous feelings  and resolutions, he found that the circumstances of his going to such  and such a place were often the most casual incidents in nature--the  caprice of a moment had carried him there, and yet he had never sat or  stood many minutes till there was the selfsame being, always in the  same position with regard to himself, as regularly as the shadow is  cast from the substance, or the ray of light from the opposing denser  medium.    For instance, he remembered one day of setting out with the intention  of going to attend divine worship in the High Church, and when, within  a short space of its door, he was overtaken by young Kilpatrick of  Closeburn, who was bound to the Grey-Friars to see his sweetheart, as  he said: \"and if you will go with me, Colwan,\" said he, \"I will let you  see her too, and then you will be just as far forward as I am.\"    George assented at once, and went; and, after taking his seat, he  leaned his head forwards on the pew to repeat over to himself a short  ejaculatory prayer, as had always been his custom on entering the house  of God. When he had done, he lifted his eye naturally towards that  point on his right hand where the fierce apparition of his brother had  been wont to meet his view: there he was, in the same habit, form,  demeanour, and precise point of distance, as usual! George again laid  down his head, and his mind was so astounded that he had nearly fallen  into a swoon. He tried shortly after to muster up courage to look at  the speaker, at the congregation, and at Captain Kilpatrick's  sweetheart in particular; but the fiendish glances of the young man in  the black clothes were too appalling to be withstood--his eye caught  them whether he was looking that way or not: at length his courage was  fairly mastered, and he was obliged to look down during the remainder  of the service.    By night or by day it was the same. In the gallery of the Parliament  House, in the boxes of the play-house, in the church, in the assembly,  in the streets, suburbs, and the fields; and every day, and every hour,  from the first rencounter of the two, the attendance became more and  more constant, more inexplicable, and altogether more alarming and  insufferable, until at last George was fairly driven from society, and  forced to spend his days in his and his father's lodgings with closed  doors. Even there, he was constantly harassed with the idea that, the  next time he lifted his eyes, he would to a certainty see that face,  the most repulsive to all his feelings of aught the earth contained.  The attendance of that brother was now become like the attendance of a  demon on some devoted being that had sold himself to destruction; his  approaches as undiscerned, and his looks as fraught with hideous  malignity. It was seldom that he saw him either following him in the  streets, or entering any house or church after him; he only appeared in  his place, George wist not how, or whence; and, having sped so ill in  his first friendly approaches, he had never spoken to his equivocal  attendant a second time.    It came at length into George's head, as he was pondering, by himself,  on the circumstances of this extraordinary attendance, that perhaps his  brother had relented, and, though of so sullen and unaccommodating a  temper that he would not acknowledge it, or beg a reconciliation, it  might be for that very purpose that he followed his steps night and day  in that extraordinary manner. \"I cannot for my life see for what other  purpose it can be,\" thought he. \"He never offers to attempt my life;  nor dares he, if he had the inclination; therefore, although his manner  is peculiarly repulsive to me, I shall not have my mind burdened with  the reflection that my own mother's son yearned for a reconciliation  with me and was repulsed by my haughty and insolent behaviour. The next  time he comes to my hand, I am resolved that I will accost him as one  brother ought to address another, whatever it may cost me; and, if I am  still flouted with disdain, then shall the blame rest with him.\"    After this generous resolution, it was a good while before his  gratuitous attendant appeared at his side again; and George"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22766"],[0,"Electricity for Boys (#7)"],[1,"in position, and to these parts have been added the commutator  brushes. The brush holder (18) is a horizontal bar made of hard rubber  loosely mounted upon the journal pin (7), which is 2-1/2 inches long. At  each end is a right-angled metal arm (19) secured to the bar (18) by  screws (20). To these arms the brushes (21) are attached, so that their  spring ends engage with the commutator (12). An adjusting screw (22) in  the bearing post (17), with the head thereof bearing against the  brush-holder (18), serves as a means for revolubly adjusting the brushes  with relation to the commutator.    DYNAMO WINDINGS.--There are several ways to wind the dynamos. These  can be shown better by the following diagrams (Figs. 30, 31, 32, 33):    THE FIELD.--If the field (A, Fig. 30) is not a permanent magnet, it must  be excited by a cell or battery, and the wires (B, B') are connected up  with a battery, while the wires (C, C') may be connected up to run a  motor. This would, therefore, be what is called a \"separately excited\"  dynamo. In this case the battery excites the field and the armature  (D), cutting the lines of force at the pole pieces (E), so that the  armature gathers the current for the wires (C, C').    [Illustration: _Fig. 30._ FIELD WINDING]    [Illustration: _Fig. 31._ SERIES-WOUND]    SERIES-WOUND FIELD.--Fig. 31 shows a \"series-wound\" dynamo. The wires of  the fields (A) are connected up in series with the brushes of the  armature (D), and the wires (G, G') are led out and connected up with a  lamp, motor or other mechanism. In this case, as well as in Figs. 32 and  33, both the field and the armature are made of soft gray iron. With  this winding and means of connecting the wires, the field is constantly  excited by the current passing through the wires.    SHUNT-WOUND FIELD.--Fig. 32 represents what is known as a \"shunt-wound\"  dynamo. Here the field wires (H, H) connect with the opposite brushes  of the armature, and the wires (I, I') are also connected with the  brushes, these two wires being provided to perform the work required.  This is a more useful form of winding for electroplating purposes.    [Illustration: _Fig. 32._ SHUNT-WOUND _Fig. 32._ COMPOUND-WOUND]    COMPOUND-WOUND FIELD.--Fig. 33 is a diagram of a \"compound-wound\"  dynamo. The regular field winding (J) has its opposite ends connected  directly with the armature brushes. There is also a winding, of a  comparatively few turns, of a thicker wire, one terminal (K) of which is  connected with one of the brushes and the other terminal (K') forms one  side of the lighting circuit. A wire (L) connects with the other  armature brush to form a complete lighting circuit.          CHAPTER V    HOW TO DETECT AND MEASURE ELECTRICITY      MEASURING INSTRUMENTS.--The production of an electric current would not  be of much value unless we had some way by which we might detect and  measure it. The pound weight, the foot rule and the quart measure are  very simple devices, but without them very little business could be  done. There must be a standard of measurement in electricity as well as  in dealing with iron or vegetables or fabrics.    As electricity cannot be seen by the human eye, some mechanism must be  made which will reveal its movements.    THE DETECTOR.--It has been shown in the preceding chapter that a current  of electricity passing through a wire will cause a current to pass  through a parallel wire, if the two wires are placed close together, but  not actually in contact with each other. An instrument which reveals  this condition is called a _galvanometer_. It not only detects the  presence of a current, but it shows the direction of its flow. We shall  now see how this is done.    For example, the wire (A, Fig. 35) is connected up in an electric  circuit with a permanent magnet (B) suspended by a fine wire (C), so  that the magnet (B) may freely revolve.    [Illustration: _Fig. 34._     _Fig. 35._      _Fig. 36._               TO THE RIGHT,  COMPASS MAGNET,  TO THE LEFT]    For convenience, the magnetic field is shown flowing in the direction of  the darts, in which the dart (D) represents the current within the  magnet (B) flowing toward the north pole, and the darts (E) showing the  exterior current flowing toward the south pole. Now, if the wire (A) is  brought up close to the magnet (B), and a current passed through A, the  magnet (B) will be affected. Fig. 35 shows the normal condition of the  magnetized bar (B) parallel with the wire (A) when a current is not  passing through the latter.    DIRECTION OF CURRENT.--If the current should go through the wire (A)  from right to left, as shown in Fig. 34, the magnet (B) would swing in  the direction taken by the hands of a clock and assume the position  shown in Fig. 34. If, on the other hand, the current in the wire (A)  should be reversed or flow from left to right, the magnet (B) would  swing counter-clock-wise, and assume the position shown in Fig. 36. The  little pointer (G) would, in either case, point in the direction of the  flow of the current through the wire (A).    [Illustration: _Fig. 37._ INDICATING DIRECTION OF CURRENT]    SIMPLE CURRENT DETECTOR.--A simple current detector may be made as  follows:    Prepare a base 3' x 4' in size and 1 inch thick. At each corner of one  end fix a binding post, as at A, A', Fig. 37. Then select 20 feet of No.  28 cotton-insulated wire, and make a coil (B) 2 inches in diameter,  leaving the ends free, so they may be affixed to the binding posts (A,  A'). Now glue or nail six blocks (C) to the base, each block being 1\" x  1\" x 2\", and lay the coil on these blocks. Then drive an L-shaped nail  (D) down into each block, on the inside of the coil, as shown, so as to  hold the latter in place.    [Illustration: _Fig. 38._ THE BRIDGE]    Now make a bridge (E, Fig. 38) of a strip of brass 1/2 inch wide, 1/16  inch thick and long enough to span the coil, and bend the ends down, as  at F, so as to form legs. A screw hole (G) is formed in each foot, so it  may be screwed to the base.    Midway between the ends this bridge has a transverse slot (H) in one  edge, to receive therein the pivot pin of the swinging magnet. In order  to hold the pivot pin in place, cut out an H-shaped piece of sheet brass  (I), which, when laid on the bridge, has its ends bent around the  latter, as shown at J, and the crossbar of the H-shaped piece then will  prevent the pivot pin from coming out of the slot (H).    [Illustration: _Fig. 39._ DETAILS OF DETECTOR]    The magnet is made of a bar of steel (K, Fig. 39) 1-1/2 inches long, 3/8  inch wide and 1/16 inch thick, a piece of a clock spring being very  serviceable for this purpose. The pivot pin is made of an ordinary pin  (L), and as it is difficult to solder the steel magnet (K) to the pin,  solder only a small disc (M) to the pin (L). Then bore a hole (N)  through the middle of the magnet (K), larger in diameter than the pin  (L), and, after putting the pin in the hole, pour sealing wax into the  hole, and thereby secure the two parts together. Near the upper end of  the pin (L) solder the end of a pointer (O), this pointer being at right  angles to the armature (K). It is better to have a metal socket for the  lower end of the pin. When these parts are put together, as shown in  Fig. 37, a removable glass top, or cover, should be provided.    This is shown in Fig. 40, in which a square, wooden frame (P) is used,  and a glass (Q) fitted into the frame, the glass being so arranged that  when the cover is in position it will be in close proximity to the upper  projecting end of the pivot pin (L), and thus prevent the magnet from  becoming misplaced.    [Illustration: _Fig. 40._ CROSS SECTION OF DETECTOR]    HOW TO PLACE THE DETECTOR.--If the detector is placed north and south,  as shown by the two markings, N and S (Fig. 37), the magnet bar will  point north and south, being affected by the earth's magnetism; but when  a current of electricity flows through the coil (B), the magnet will be  deflected to the right or to the left, so that the pointer (O) will then  show the direction in which the current is flowing through the wire (R)  which you are testing.    The next step of importance is to _measure_ the current, that is, to  determine its strength or intensity, as well as the flow or quantity.    DIFFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING A CURRENT.--There are several ways to  measure the properties of a current, which may be defined as follows:    1. THE SULPHURIC ACID VOLTAMETER.--By means of an electrolytic action,  whereby the current decomposes an acidulated solution--that is, water  which has in it a small amount of sulphuric acid--and then measuring the  gas generated by the current.    2. THE COPPER VOLTAMETER.--By electro-chemical means, in which the  current passes through plates immersed in a solution of copper sulphate.    3. THE GALVANOSCOPE.--By having a coil of insulated wire, with a magnet  suspended so as to turn freely within the coil, forming what is called a  galvanoscope.    4. ELECTRO-MAGNETIC METHOD.--By using a pair of magnets and sending a  current through the coils, and then measuring the pull on the armature.    5. THE POWER OR SPEED METHOD.--By using an electric fan, and noting the  revolutions produced by the current.    6. THE CALORIMETER.--By using a coil of bare wire, immersed in paraffine  oil, and then measuring the temperature by means of a thermometer.    [Illustration: _Fig. 41._ ACID VOLTAMETER]    [Illustration: _Fig. 42._ COPPER VOLTAMETER]    7. THE LIGHT METHOD.--Lastly, by means of an electric light, which  shows, by its brightness, a greater or less current.    THE PREFERRED METHODS.--It has been found that the first and second  methods are the only ones which will accurately register current  strength, and these methods have this advantage--that the chemical  effect produced is not dependent upon the size or shape of the apparatus  or the plates used.
