And presently Deedeeaskh came  back, bubbling over with the excitement, whistling to them in his own  way that he had followed the rascal clear to his den, and would keep a  sharp watch over him in future.    When a big hawk came near, or when, on dark afternoons, a young owl took  to hunting in the neighborhood, the jays sounded the alarm, and the  fishhawks swept up from the lake on the instant. Whether Deedeeaskh were  more concerned for his own young than for the young fishhawks I have no  means of knowing. The fishermen's actions at such times showed a  curious mixture of fear and defiance. The mother would sit on the nest  while Ismaques circled over it, both birds uttering a shrill, whistling  challenge. But they never attacked the feathered robbers, as they had  done with the fisher, and, so far as I could see, there was no need.  Kookooskoos the owl and Hawahak the hawk might be very hungry; but the  sight of those great wings circling over the nest and the shrill cry of  defiance in their ears sent them hurriedly away to other hunting  grounds.    There was only one enemy that ever seriously troubled the fishhawks; and  he did it in as decent a sort of way as was possible under the  circumstances. That was Cheplahgan the eagle. When he was hungry and had  found nothing himself, and his two eaglets, far away in their nest on  the mountain, needed a bite of fish to vary their diet, he would set his  wings to the breeze and mount up till he could see both ospreys at their  fishing. There, sailing in slow circles, he would watch for hours till  he saw Ismaques catch a big fish, when he would drop like a bolt and  hold him up at the point of his talons, like any other highwayman. It  was of no use trying to escape. Sometimes Ismaques would attempt it, but  the great dark wings would whirl around him and strike down a sharp and  unmistakable warning. It always ended the same way. Ismaques, being  wise, would drop his fish, and the eagle would swoop down after it,  often seizing it ere it reached the water. But he never injured the  fishhawks, and he never disturbed the nest. So they got along well  enough together. Cheplahgan had a bite of fish now and then in his own  high-handed way; and honest Ismaques, who never went long hungry, made  the best of a bad situation. Which shows that fishing has also taught  him patience, and a wise philosophy of living.    The jays took no part in these struggles. Occasionally they cried out a  sharp warning as Cheplahgan came plunging down out of the blue, over the  head of Ismaques; but they seemed to know perfectly how the unequal  contest must end, and they always had a deal of jabber among themselves  over it, the meaning of which I could never make out.    As for myself, I am sure that Deedeeaskh could never make up his mind  what to think of me. At first, when I came, he would cry out a danger  note that brought the fishhawks circling over their nest, looking down  into the underbrush with wild yellow eyes to see what danger threatened.  But after I had hidden myself away a few times, and made no motion to  disturb either the nest or the hungry prowlers that came to feast on  the fishhawks' bounty, Deedeeaskh set me down as an idle, harmless  creature who would, nevertheless, bear watching. He never got over his  curiosity to know what brought me there. Sometimes, when I thought him  far away, I would find him suddenly on a branch just over my head,  looking down at me intently. When I went away he would follow me,  whistling, to my canoe; but he never called the fishhawks again, unless  some unusual action of mine aroused his suspicion; and after one look  they would circle away, as if they knew they had nothing to fear. They  had seen me fishing so often that they thought they understood me,  undoubtedly.    There was one curious habit of these birds that I had never noticed  before. Occasionally, when the weather threatened a change, or when the  birds and their little ones had fed full, Ismaques would mount up to an  enormous altitude, where he would sail about in slow circles, his broad  vans steady to the breeze, as if he were an ordinary hen hawk, enjoying  himself and contemplating the world from an indifferent distance.  Suddenly, with one clear, sharp whistle to announce his intention,  he would drop like a plummet for a thousand feet, catch himself in  mid-air, and zigzag down to the nest in the spruce top, whirling,  diving, tumbling, and crying aloud the while in wild, ecstatic  exclamations,--just as a woodcock comes whirling, plunging, twittering  down from a height to his brown mate in the alders below. Then Ismaques  would mount up again and repeat his dizzy plunge, while his larger mate  stood quiet in the spruce top, and the little fishhawks tiptoed about  the edge of the nest, _pip-pipping_ their wonder and delight at their  own papa's dazzling performance.    This is undoubtedly one of Ismaques' springtime habits, by which he  tries to win an admiring look from the keen yellow eyes of his mate; but  I noticed him using it more frequently as the little fishhawks' wings  spread to a wonderful length, and he was trying, with his mate, by every  gentle means to induce them to leave the nest. And I have  wondered--without being able at all to prove my theory--whether he were  not trying in this remarkable way to make his little ones want to fly by  showing them how wonderful a thing flying could be made to be.    [Illustration]          A School for Little Fishermen    [Illustration]      There came a day when, as I sat fishing among the rocks, the cry of the  mother osprey changed as she came sweeping up to my fishing  grounds,--_Chip, ch'wee! Chip, chip, ch'weeeee?_ That was the  fisherman's hail plainly enough; but there was another note in it, a  look-here cry of triumph and satisfaction. Before I could turn my head,  for a fish was nibbling, there came other sounds behind it,--_Pip, pip,  pip, ch'weee! pip, ch'wee! pip, ch'weeee!_ a curious medley, a hail of  good-luck cries; and I knew without turning that two other fishermen had  come to join the brotherhood.    The mother bird--one can tell her instantly by her greater size and  darker breast markings--veered in as I turned to greet the newcomers,  and came directly over my head, her two little ones flapping lustily  behind her. Two days before, when I went down to another lake on an  excursion after bigger trout, the young fishhawks were still standing  on the nest, turning a deaf ear to all the old birds' assurances that  the time had come to use their big wings. The last glimpse I had of them  through my glass showed me the mother bird in one tree, the father in  another, each holding a fish, which they were showing the young across a  tantalizing short stretch of empty air, telling the young in fishhawk  language to come across and get it; while the young birds, on their  part, stretched wings and necks hungrily and tried to whistle the fish  over to them, as one would call a dog across the street.    In the short interval that I was absent mother wiles and mother patience  had done their good work. The young were already flying well. Now they  were out for their first lesson in fishing, evidently; and I stopped  fishing myself, letting my bait sink into the mud--where an eel  presently tangled my hooks into an old root--to see how it was done. For  fishing is not an instinct with Ismaques, but a simple matter of  training. As with young otters, they know only from daily experience  that fish, and not grouse and rabbits, are their legitimate food. Left  to themselves, especially if one should bring them up on flesh and then  turn them loose, they would go straight back to the old hawk habit of  hunting the woods, which is much easier. To catch fish, therefore, they  must be taught from the first day they leave the nest. And it is a  fascinating experience for any man to watch the way they go about it.    The young ospreys flew heavily in short irregular circles, scanning the  water with their inexperienced eyes for their first strike. Over them  wheeled the mother bird on broad, even wings, whistling directions to  the young neophytes, who would presently be initiated into the old sweet  mysteries of going a-fishing. Fish were plenty enough; but that means  nothing to a fishhawk, who must see his game reasonably near the surface  before making his swoop. There was a good jump on the lake, and the sun  shone brightly into it. Between the glare and the motion on the surface  the young fishermen were having a hard time of it. Their eyes were not  yet quick enough to tell them when to swoop. At every gleam of silver in  the depths below they would stop short and cry out: _Pip!_ \"there he  is!\" _Pip, pip!_ \"here goes!\" like a boy with his first nibble. But a  short, clear whistle from the mother stopped them ere they had begun to  fall; and they would flap up to her, protesting eagerly that they could  catch that fellow, sure, if she would only let them try.    As they wheeled in over me on their way down the lake, one of the  youngsters caught the gleam of my pile of chub among the rocks. _Pip,  ch'weee!_ he whistled, and down they came, both of them, like rockets.  They were hungry; here at hand were fish galore; and they had not  noticed me at all, sitting very still among the rocks. _Pip, pip, pip,  hurrah!_ they piped as they came down.    But the mother bird, who had noted me and my pile of fish the first  thing as she rounded the point, swept in swiftly with a curious,  half-angry, half-anxious chiding that I had never heard from her  before,--_Chip, chip, chip! Chip! Chip!_--growing sharper and shriller  at each repetition, till they heeded it and swerved aside. As I looked  up they were just over my head, looking down at me now with eager,  wondering eyes. Then they were led aside in a wide circle and talked to  with wise, quiet whistlings before they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22107"],[0,"Wood-Carving: Design and Workmanship (#7)"],[1,"and then used until they became dull, but tools that were  always sharp, and never allowed to approach dullness. Sharpening tools  is indeed an art in itself, and like other arts has its votaries, who  successfully conquer its difficulties with apparent ease, while others  are baffled at every point. Impatience is the stumbling-block in such  operations. Those most painstaking people, the Chinese, according to all  accounts, put magic into their sharpening stones; the keenness of their  blades being only equaled by that of their wits in all such matters of  delicate application. To make a good beginning is a great point gained.  To carefully examine every tool, and at the expense of time correct the  faults of management, is the only way to become expert in sharpening  tools.          CHAPTER VI    CHIP CARVING           Its Savage Origin--A Clue to its only Claim to Artistic       Importance--Monotony better than Variety--An Exercise in Impatience       and Precision--Technical Methods.      One of the simplest forms of wood-carving is that known as \"chip\"  carving. This kind of work is by no means of modern origin, as its  development may be traced to a source in the barbaric instinct for  decoration common to the ancient inhabitants of New Zealand and other  South Sea Islands. Technically, and with modern tools, it is a form of  the art which demands but little skill, save in the matter of precision  and patient repetition. As practised by its savage masters, the  perfection of these two qualities elevates their work to the dignity of  a real art. It is difficult to conceive the contradictory fact, that  this apparently simple form of art was once the exponent of a struggling  desire for refinement on the part of fierce and warlike men, and that it  should, under the influence of polite society, become the all-too-easy  task of esthetically minded schoolgirls. In the hands of those warrior  artists, and with the tools at their command, mostly fashioned from  sharpened fish-bones and such like rude materials, it was an art which  required the equivalent of many fine artistic qualities, as such are  understood by more cultivated nations. The marvelous dexterity and  determined purpose evinced in the laborious decoration of canoe paddles,  ax-handles, and other weapons, is, under such technical disabilities as  to tools, really very impressive. This being so, there is no inherent  reason why such a rudimentary form of the art as \"chip\" carving should  not be practised in a way consistent with its true nature and  limitations. As its elemental distinctions are so few, and its methods  so simple, it follows that in recognizing such limitations, we shall  make the most of our design. Instead, then, of trusting to a forced  variety, let us seek for its strong point in an opposite direction, and  by the monotonous repetition of basket-like patterns, win the  not-to-be-despised praise which is due to patience and perseverance. In  this way only can such a restricted form of artistic expression become  in the least degree interesting. The designs usually associated with the  \"civilized\" practise of this work are, generally speaking, of the kind  known as \"geometric,\" that is to say, composed of circles and straight  lines intersecting each other in complicated pattern. Now the \"variety\"  obtained in this manner, as contrasted with the dignified monotony of  the savage's method, is the note which marks a weak desire to attain  great results with little effort. The \"variety,\" as such, is wholly  mechanical, the technical difficulties, with modern tools at command,  are felt at a glance to be very trifling; therefore such designs are  quite unsuitable to the kind of work, if human sympathies are to be  excited in a reasonable way.    An important fact in connection with this kind of design is that most of  these geometric patterns are, apart from their uncomfortable \"variety,\"  based on too large a scale as to detail. All the laborious carving on  paddles and clubs, such as may be seen in our museums, is founded upon  a scale of detail in which the holes vary in size from 1/16 to something  under 1/4 in. their longest way, only in special places, such as  borders, etc., attaining a larger size. Such variety as the artist has  permitted himself being confined to the _occasional_ introduction of a  circular form, but mostly obtained by a subtle change in the proportion  of the holes, or by an alternate emphasis upon perpendicular or  horizontal lines.    As a test of endurance, and as an experimental effort with carving  tools, I set you this exercise. In Fig. 12 you will find a pattern taken  from one of those South Sea carvings which we have been considering.  Now, take one of the articles so often disfigured with childish and  hasty efforts to cover a surface with so-called \"art work,\" such as the  side of a bellows or the surface of a bread-plate, and on it carve this  pattern, repeating the same-shaped holes until you fill the entire  space. By the time you have completed it you will begin to understand  and appreciate one of the fundamental qualities which must go toward the  making of a carver, namely, patience; and you will have produced a  thing which may give you pleasant surprises, in the unexpected but very  natural admiration it elicits from your friends.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    Having drawn the pattern on your wood, ruling the lines to measurement,  and being careful to keep your lines thin and clear as drawn with a  somewhat hard pencil, proceed to cut out the holes with the chisel, No.  11 on our list, 1/4 in. wide. It will serve the purpose much better than  the knife usually sold for this kind of work, and will be giving you  useful practise with a very necessary carving tool. The corner of the  chisel will do most of the work, sloping it to suit the different angles  at the bottom of the holes. Each chip should come out with a clean cut,  but to insure this the downward cuts should be done first, forming the  raised diagonal lines.    When you have successfully performed this piece of discipline, you may,  if you care to do more of the same kind of work, carry out a design  based upon the principles we have been discussing, but introducing a  very moderate amount of variety by using one or more of the patterns  shown in Fig. 12, all of which are from the same dusky artist's designs  and can not be improved upon. If you wish for more variety than these  narrow limits afford, then try some other kind of carving, with perhaps  leafage as its motive.          CHAPTER VII    THE GRAIN OF THE WOOD           Obstinacy of the Woody Fiber--First Exercise in       Grounding--Description of Method--Cutting the Miters--Handling of       Tools, Danger of Carelessness--Importance of Clean Cutting.      It is curious to imagine what the inside of a young enthusiast's head  must be like when he makes his first conscious step toward artistic  expression. The chaotic jumbles of half-formed ideas, whirling about in  its recesses, produce kaleidoscopic effects, which to him look like the  most lovely pictures. If he could only learn to put them down! let him  but acquire the technical department of his art, and what easier than to  realize those most marvelous dreams. Later in his progress it begins to  dawn upon him that this same technical department may not be so very  obedient to his wishes; it may have laws of its own, which shall change  his fairy fancies into sober images, not at all unlike something which  has often been done before by others. But let the young soul continue to  see visions, the more the better, provided they be of the right sort. We  shall in the meantime ask him to curb his imagination, and yield his  faculties for the moment to the apparently simple task of realizing a  leaf or two from one of the trees in his enchanted valley.    With the student's kind permission we shall, while these lessons  continue, make believe that teacher and pupil are together in a  class-room, or, better still, in a country workshop, with chips flying  in all directions under busy hands.    I must tell you then, that the first surprise which awaits the beginner,  and one which opens his eyes to a whole series of restraints upon the  freedom of his operations, lies in the discovery that wood has a decided  grain or fiber. He will find that it sometimes behaves in a very  obstinate manner, refusing to cut straight here, chipping off there, and  altogether seeming to take pleasure in thwarting his every effort. By  and by he gets to know his piece of wood; where the grain dips and  where it comes up or wriggles, and with practise he becomes its master.  He finds in this, his first technical difficulty, a kind of blessing in  disguise, because it sets bounds to what would otherwise be an  infinitely vague choice of methods.    We shall now take a piece of yellow pine, free from knots, and planed  clean all round. The size may be about 12 ins. long by 7 ins. wide. We  shall fix this to the bench by means of two clamps or one clamp and a  screwed block at opposite corners. Now we are ready to begin work, but  up to the present we have not thought of the design we intend executing,  being so intent upon the tools and impatient for an attack upon the  silky wood with their sharp edges.    The illustration, Fig. 13, gives a clue to the sort of design to begin  with; it measures about 11 ins. long by 7 ins. wide, allowing a margin  all round. The wood should be a little longer than the design, as the  ends get spoiled by the clamps. This little design need not, and indeed  should not, be copied. Make one for yourself entirely different, only  bearing in mind the points which are to be observed in arranging it,  and which have for their object the avoidance of difficulties likely to  be too much for a first effort. These points are somewhat to this  effect: the design should be of leaves, laid out flat on a"]]]
