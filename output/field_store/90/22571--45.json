They came as  conquerors, but in time were absorbed in the more stable Slavonic type.    Without a doubt the Bulgars were racially nearly akin to the  Turks--first cousins at least. Mingling with the Slavs they adopted  their language and many of their customs. But something of the Turk  survives to this day in the character of the Bulgarian people. It shows  particularly in their treatment of their women. Though the Bulgarian is  monogamic he submits his wife to an almost _harem_ discipline. Once  married she lives for the family alone. Though she does not wear a veil  in the streets it is not customary for her to go out from her home  except with her husband, nor to receive company except in his presence,  nor to frequent theatres, restaurants, or other places of public  amusement. There is thus no social life in Bulgaria in the European  sense of the term, and there is great scope there for a campaign for  \"women's rights.\"    The Bulgars taking command over the Slav population in Bulgaria began a  warfare against the enfeebled Greek Empire. That Empire gave up Moesia  to the Bulgarian King, Isperich, and agreed to pay him a tribute, it  being the custom of the degenerate descendants of the Roman Empire of  the period thus to attempt to buy safety with bribes. The Emperor  Justinian II. stopped this tribute, and a war followed, in which the  Bulgarians were successful, and Justinian lost his throne and was driven  to exile. Later, Justinian made another treaty with the Bulgarians and  offered his daughter in marriage to the new Bulgarian King, Tervel, and  with Bulgarian help he was restored to his throne. But war between the  Bulgars and the Empire was chronic. To quote a Bulgarian chronicler:        The chief characteristics of the Bulgars were warlike virtues,      discipline, patriotism, and enthusiasm. The Bulgarian kings      brought their victorious armies to the gates of Constantinople,      whose very existence they threatened. The Greek Emperor sought      their friendship, and even consented to pay them tribute.    Bulgaria attained her greatest empire in the reign of King Kroum.  Between King Isperich and King Kroum, however, Bulgaria had many ups and  downs. The Bulgarian King, Kormisos, once almost reached the walls of  Constantinople. But trouble among his own people prevented his victories  being pushed home. Then a series of civil wars in Bulgaria weakened the  nation, and a great section of it migrated to Asia Minor. The Roman  Emperor, Constantine V., took this occasion to exact a full revenge for  previous Bulgar attacks on Constantinople. The Bulgar army was routed,  and an invading force carried the torch into every Bulgarian town. A new  Bulgar King, Cerig, restored his country's position somewhat by a  secretly plotted massacre of all its enemies within its boundaries. The  Empress Irene then ascended the Imperial throne at Constantinople and  found herself unable to withstand the Bulgar power, and went back to the  system of paying tribute to the Bulgarians as the price of safety.    King Kroum next ascended the throne of Bulgaria and, capable and savage  warrior as he was, raised its power vastly. He defeated and slew the  Greek Emperor, Nicephorus, in battle, and captured Sofia (809), the  present capital of Bulgaria. Warfare was savage in those days, and  between the Bulgars and the Greek emperors particularly savage. The  defeated Imperial army was massacred to a man, from the Emperor down to  the foot-soldier. King Kroum afterwards used the skull of the descendant  of the Caesars as a drinking-cup.    A siege of Constantinople followed the defeat and death of the Emperor  Nicephorus. The Bulgars affrighted the defenders of the city by their  fierce orgies before the walls, by the human sacrifices they offered up  in their sight, and by the resolute refusal of all quarter in the field.  The Empire tried to buy off the Bulgars with the promise of an annual  tribute of gold, of cloth, and of young girls. The invaders finally  retired with a great booty, and the death of King Kroum soon after  relieved the anxiety of Constantinople.    Bulgaria seems now (the ninth century) to have suffered again from  internal dissensions. These arose mostly out of religious issues. Many  of the Slavs had become Christians, and some of the Bulgars also adopted  the new faith. For a time the kings tried to crush out Christianity by  persecutions, but in 864 the Bulgarian King, Boris, adopted  Christianity--some say converted by his sister, who had been a prisoner  of the Greeks and was baptized by them. His adherence to Christianity  was announced in a treaty with the Greek Emperor, Michael III. Some of  King Boris's subjects kept their affection for paganism and objected to  the conversion of their king. Following the customs of the time they  were all massacred, and Bulgaria became thus a wholly Christian kingdom.    King Boris, whom the Bulgarians look up to as the actual founder of the  Bulgarian nation of to-day, hesitated long as to whether he should  attach himself and his nation to the Roman or to the Greek branch of  the Christian Church. He made the issue a matter of close bargaining.  The Church was sought which was willing to allow to Bulgaria the highest  degree of ecclesiastical independence, and which seemed to offer as the  price of adhesion the greatest degree of political advantage.    [Illustration: ANCIENT COSTUME OF BALKAN PEASANT WOMEN NEAR GABROVO]    At first the Greek Church would not allow Bulgaria to have a Patriarch  of her own. King Boris sent, then, a deputation to Pope Nicholas at  Rome, seeking if a better national bargain could be made there. Two  bishops came over from Rome to negotiate. But in time King Boris veered  back to a policy of attaching himself to the Greek Church, which now  offered Bulgaria an Archbishop with a rank in the Church second only to  that of the Greek Patriarch. In 869 Bulgaria definitely threw in her lot  with the Greek Church.    Curiously those old religious controversies of the ninth century were  revived in the nineteenth. Bulgaria has a persistent sense of  nationalism, and looks upon religion largely in a national sense. In the  ninth century her first care in changing her religion was to safeguard  national interests. In the nineteenth century the first great  concession she wrung from her Turkish masters was the setting up (1870)  of a Bulgarian Exarch to be the official head of the Bulgarian Orthodox  Church independent of the Greek Patriarch. A little later in the days of  her freedom, when to her Roman Catholic ruler, King Ferdinand, was born  a son (named Boris after the first Christian king of Bulgaria), the  Bulgarians had him transferred in 1896 from the Roman to the Greek  Church as a matter of national policy.    The controversy to-day between \"Patriarchate\" adherents of the Orthodox  Church--_i.e._ Greeks, and the Exarchate adherents--_i.e._ Bulgarians,  is perhaps the most bitter of all Balkan controversies. I have found it  in places transcending far the religious gap between Turk and Christian,  and in that particularly stormy North Macedonian corner of the Balkans a  Patriarchate man gives first place in his hatred to an Exarchate man and  second place to a Turk; and the Exarchate man reciprocates in like  manner. Yet, as the Bulgarians insist, \"the autonomous orthodox  Bulgarian Church forms an inseparable part of the Holy Orthodox Church.\"    The Bulgarian Exarchate used to comprise all the Bulgarian dioceses in  the provinces of the Turkish Empire, as they were enumerated explicitly  or in general terms by the Firman of 1870 as well as the dioceses of the  Bulgarian Principality. Most of the orthodox Bulgarian population in  Turkey recognise the authority of the Exarchate, but some still owe  allegiance to the Greek Patriarchate. What the religious position will  be now that the wars of 1912-1913 have changed boundaries so considerably  it is hard to say. The Exarchate dioceses which used to be in Turkish  territory but are now in Bulgarian territory, will, of course, pass into  the main current of Bulgarian church life. But those Exarchate dioceses  which have passed to Servia and to Greece will probably not find  toleration.    King Boris of Bulgaria having raised his country to a great fame, and  having endowed it with a national church, retired to a monastery in 888  to make his peace with the next world. His son Vladimir succeeded to the  throne, but ruled so unwisely that King Boris came back from the  cloister to depose Vladimir and to set in his stead upon the throne  Simeon, who created the first Bulgarian Empire.          CHAPTER IV    BULGARIA--A POWER AND A TURKISH PROVINCE      King Simeon reigned in Bulgaria thirty-four years, and raised his  country during that time to the highest point of power it ever reached.  Simeon had been educated at Constantinople and had learned all that the  civilisation of the Grecian Empire could teach except a love and respect  for the Grecian rule. He designed the overthrow of the tottering Grecian  Empire, and dreamed of Bulgaria as the heir to the power of the Caesars.    When Simeon came to the throne, for many years the Grecian Empire and  Bulgaria had been at peace. But a trade grievance soon enabled Simeon to  enter upon a war against the feeble Greek Emperor then on the throne in  Constantinople--Leo, known as the Philosopher. The Grecian forces were  defeated and, following the ferocious Balkan custom of the times, the  Grecian prisoners were all mutilated by having their noses cut off, and  thus returned to their city. Constantinople in desperation appealed for  help to the Magyars, who had recently burst into Europe from the steppes  of Russia and occupied the land north of the Danube. The Magyars  responded to the appeal, and at first were successful against the  Bulgars, but King"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22260"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Abbey Church of Tewkesbury (#7)"],[1,"pinnacle testifies. They were restored in 1825.       [Illustration: _Photo. D. Gwynne._     THE ABBEY, FROM THE SOUTH.]    As to what was there before 1660 one can only conjecture, but it had  been undoubtedly damaged by the fall of the wooden spire covered with  lead, which event occurred on Easter Day, 1559.    From whichever point of the compass it be studied, there is ever a  different charm displayed, and the charm varies according to the light  that plays upon the time-honoured handiwork of the Norman builders.  The tower looks equally well from the north-west end of the  churchyard, seen through the trees, from the extreme west, and from  the open ground to the south-east, where the eye can also take in the  graceful battlementing of the choir. Perhaps the best view of the  tower and the building generally is that obtainable from the  Gloucester road, just as one turns the last corner coming into  Tewkesbury.    The tower is supported by four piers, which, as will be seen from an  inspection of the plan, are very massive. The two easternmost piers  are in plan very similar to the two corresponding piers in Gloucester  Cathedral.    There are two windows in each side of the lower storey or base,  immediately over the roofs of the nave and transepts, and between the  windows is the stone ridge or wall-plate which indicates the pitch of  the earlier roof. On three sides of the tower the dripstone is almost  perfect.    The next stage or storey has an arcade with two lights in each side of  the tower. The third stage has a narrower intersecting arcade of great  beauty and delicacy, with a curious effect produced by the warm  colouring of some of the stones.[3]    In the topmost stage there is another range of arcades and columns.    =The West Front.=--The chief feature in this front is the noble  recessed arch, 65 feet high and 34 feet wide. There are seven columns  on each side of the arch, one being partially concealed by the  masonry of the Debased Perpendicular window which was inserted  originally to give light to the nave. Portions of the seventh shaft  have been, however, exposed for inspection.    There is one slight defect in this unique west front as it now is,  viz., that apart from the window, the arch is on too large a scale for  the size of the front, or, as Dean Spence puts it (he himself is  quoting from some other writer), \"As this noble arch stands at  present, it is extremely beautiful in itself, but it has an incomplete  appearance, seeming to want a _raison d'etre_, and being too large a  jewel for its setting.\"[4] Exactly the same may be said of the window,  though its excessive size will not be felt so much from the outside as  from the inside of the church, where the low vaulting of the nave  further accentuates the excessive size of the window.    As was the case at Gloucester, larger western towers were originally  contemplated to contain the bells, and there are indications of this  in the rough stonework in the clerestory on the south side, evidently  designed to carry a tower 22 feet square. The towers in the west front  at Southwell are an example of this design carried out. When it was  decided to build smaller towers, the bell tower or campanile (which is  shown on p. 17) was built. Later again the lantern or open part of the  interior of the tower was vaulted over (_vide_ p. 74), and the bells  were hung in the great central tower. The campanile was then diverted  to other uses. In later times it was used as a prison for several  years, but having become structurally unsafe, was demolished in 1817.    It would be interesting to know the original scheme of windows in this  west front. There is a trace of the original Norman doorway inside the  present doorway, and it is supposed that the original window was  either a large round window, with possibly one or two tiers of  round-headed lights below. Later, a larger window, probably of  fourteenth century work, was inserted, which lasted till it was blown  into the church in 1661. The present window, which was built in 1686,  may probably have been an attempt to follow the lines of the previous  window. At either side of the large arch is a Decorated window of two  lights.    The stonework of the towers, above the point where the arch springs,  is decorated with a Norman arcading in two tiers. They are finished by  two partly Norman turrets, with later pinnacles and spires.    =The South Side.=--This side has a blank appearance owing to the total  disappearance of the claustral and conventual buildings, all of which  were \"deemed to be superfluous.\" There are traces on the south wall of  the \"outer parlour,\" and there is blocked up into it a doorway from  the west end of the south aisle of the nave. Traces are there, too, of  Norman work on the wall, which prove that the Norman cloisters were of  the same extent and size as those of Perpendicular times.    =The Cloisters.=--These were of two periods of Perpendicular work, and  though smaller than those at Gloucester (80 feet as compared with 148  feet) seem to have been enriched with panelling and arcading in every  way as fine, judging from the stone which shows the spring of the  arches near the cloister door.    The doorway from the cloister to the south aisle is a beautiful piece  of fifteenth century work. It consists of a low pointed arch, struck  from two centres, in the hollow moulding of which are canopies. Below  are pedestals for figures. At the top the arch is embattled, and above  it are niches, seven in all, with pedestals and canopies, richly  ornamented and carved. On either side, over the canopy is an angel  bearing a plain shield. This doorway was filled with stonework up to  1892, and had been so filled for many years, but has since undergone  restoration of a very careful kind. The oak door is new, and is an  example of very florid work executed with the great mechanical  precision which now characterises modern wood-carving. One bay of the  cloister has been vaulted to protect the doorway; and the wall arcade  has been restored, at the expense of the Freemasons of the county.    On the south front of the south transept there are to be seen traces  of a building of the same width, through which there were means of  communication with the church. The wall of this south transept has  been considerably strengthened since the Dissolution.    Separated from the south transept by a slype or passage, was the  Chapter House, of which nothing is known beyond the fact that it was  repaved in 1259, and destroyed at the Dissolution with other buildings  on this side. Over the Chapter House there was a dormitory, also with  an entrance to the church. This entrance has been walled up. There  were stairs giving access to a room built over the apsidal chapel in  the south transept, and also to the transept itself.       [Illustration: _Photo. R.W. Dugdale._     THE CLOISTER DOORWAY.]    To the east of the south transept a very good view of the choir and  its chapels is to be obtained. The westernmost chapel is the Norman  apsidal chapel, and here the original Norman work comes to an end as  far as the exterior is concerned.    The Norman arcading on the east and west walls will be noticed, but it  has been lately restored.    The chapel (marked Vestry in the plan) has an upper chamber with two  commonplace modern windows in it, the mullions having been destroyed.  There is a massive buttress attached to the wall of this chapel, much  larger than any of the other exterior buttresses. It is quite hollow,  and is entered from the interior of the chapel, which is now used as  the clergy vestry.    The windows of the choir are elaborately decorated with a crocketed  gable.    The east end of the church[5] and the exterior of the chapels on the  north side of the church are in private gardens, which unfortunately  extend up to the very wall of the church, and prevent access.    The actual east end now consists of an arch which was formerly the  entrance to the destroyed Lady Chapel, of which nothing remains but  the modern masonry in the arch, now walled up, and containing a modern  window of three lights; and above this is the original west wall above  the vestibule of the Lady Chapel, with a restored window of four  lights.    The parapet of open work which runs round the summit of the apse is  another beautiful feature of the exterior of the eastern part of the  church. It seems to be formed of stalks from a thorn tree intertwining  in such a way as to form triangular openings. This parapet or coronet  is as much like lacework as it is possible for stonework to be, and  gives to the building a peculiarly delicate and subtle finish.    A very good exterior view of this east end can be obtained from the  battlement of St. Faith's Chapel. The pitch of the roof and the  character of the mouldings can thus be seen.    =The Lady Chapel.=--Nothing is left but the partly concealed mouldings  of the arch in the east wall of the ambulatory of the choir. On the  outside of the east end may be seen portions of the lofty  vaulting--just where it sprang from the walls--which would indicate  that the masonry was very beautiful and delicate work.    Much uncertainty exists as to the size of the Lady Chapel, though  traces of the foundations have been found for some distance to the  eastward of the present building. Unfortunately the ground in which  the foundations are hidden is private property, and the chance of a  thorough investigation of the site very remote. Traditionally, the  Lady Chapel is said to have been 100 feet long, or about a third of  the length of the building. There is no documentary evidence to  support this tradition, and in the absence of such confirmation Mr.  Blunt supposes that there was no large Lady Chapel,[6] but that a  chapel somewhat similar to those still surviving, and specifically  referred to as \"Capella Beatae Mariae Ecclesiae Conventualis,\" was"]]]
