The dog having lost all hopes of the assistance of  these men undertook the task alone, and ran downstairs; he could not find  the villain in the shop, but immediately rushing into the street came up  with him, and tearing off his cloak, would have treated him according to  his deserts if the fellow had not called to some tailors in the  neighbourhood, and begged they would assist him against a mad dog; the  tailors believing him came to his assistance, and compelled the poor  animal to retire.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XLVIII.    A Shrewd Guesser.      A French officer, more remarkable for his birth and spirit than his  wealth, had served the Venetian republic for some years with great valour  and fidelity, but had not met with that preferment which he merited. One  day he waited on a nobleman whom he had often solicited in vain, but on  whose friendship he had still some reliance. The reception he met with was  cool and mortifying; the nobleman turned his back upon the necessitous  veteran, and left him to find his way to the street through a suite of  apartments magnificently furnished. He passed them lost in thought, till,  casting his eyes on a sumptuous sideboard, where a valuable collection of  Venetian glass, polished and formed in the highest degree of perfection,  stood on a damask cloth as a preparation for a splendid entertainment, he  took hold of a corner of the linen, and turning to a faithful English  mastiff which always accompanied him, said to the animal, in a kind of  absence of mind, \"Here, my poor old friend; you see how these haughty  tyrants indulge themselves, and yet how we are treated!\" The poor dog  looked his master in the face, and gave tokens that he understood him. The  master walked on, but the mastiff slackened his pace, and laying hold of  the damask cloth with his teeth, at one hearty pull brought all the glass  on the sideboard in shivers to the ground, thus depriving the insolent  noble of his favourite exhibition of splendour.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XLIX.    A Tame Colony.      A well-known traveller, in a description of the Island of Tristan  d'Acunha, states that the animals found on this solitary spot were so  tame, that it was necessary to clear a path through the birds which were  reposing on the rocks, by kicking them aside. One species of seal did not  move at all when struck or pelted, and at length some of the company  amused themselves by mounting them, and riding them into the sea!    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE L.    An Usurper Punished.      Some years ago a sparrow had early in spring taken possession of an old  swallow's nest, and had laid some eggs in it, when the original builder  and owner of the castle made her appearance, and claimed possession. The  sparrow, firmly seated, resisted the claim of the swallow; a smart battle  ensued, in which the swallow was joined by its mate, and during the  conflict by several of their comrades. All the efforts of the assembled  swallows to dislodge the usurper were, however, unsuccessful. Finding  themselves completely foiled in this object, it would seem that they had  held a council of war to consult on ulterior measures; and the resolution  they came to shows that with no ordinary degree of ingenuity some very  lofty considerations of right and justice were combined in their  deliberations. Since the sparrow could not be dispossessed of the nest,  the next question with them appears to have been, how he could be  otherwise punished for his unlawful occupation of a property  unquestionably belonging to its original constructor. The council were  unanimous in thinking that nothing short of the death of the intruder  could atone for so heinous an offence; and having so decided, they  proceeded to put their sentence into execution in the following very  extraordinary manner. Quitting the scene of the contest for a time, they  returned with accumulated numbers, each bearing a beak full of building  materials; and without any further attempt to beat out the sparrow, they  instantly set to work and built up the entrance into the nest, enclosing  the sparrow within the clay tenement, and leaving her to perish in the  stronghold she had so bravely defended.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LI.    The Rights of Hospitality.      A native Moor who went to hunt the lion, having proceeded far into a  forest, happened to meet with two lion's whelps that came to caress him;  the hunter stopped with the little animals, and waiting for the coming of  the sire or the dam, took out his breakfast, and gave them a part. The  lioness arrived unperceived by the huntsman, so that he had not time, or  perhaps wanted the courage, to take to his gun. After having for some time  looked at the man that was thus feasting her young, the lioness went away,  and soon after returned, bearing with her a sheep, which she came and laid  at the huntsman's feet.    The Moor, thus become one of the family, took this occasion of making a  good meal, skinned the sheep, made a fire, and roasted a part, giving the  entrails to the young. The lion in his turn came also; and, as if  respecting the rights of hospitality, showed no tokens whatever of  ferocity. Their guest the next day, having finished his provisions,  returned, and came to a resolution never more to kill any of those  animals, the noble generosity of which he had so fully proved. He stroked  and caressed the whelps at taking leave of them, and the dam and sire  accompanied him till he was safely out of the forest.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LII.    A Grateful Lioness.      A Dreadful famine raged at Buenos Ayres, yet the governor, afraid of  giving the Indians a habit of spilling Spanish blood, forbade the  inhabitants on pain of death to go into the fields in search of relief,  placing soldiers at all the outlets to the country, with orders to fire  upon those who should attempt to transgress his orders. A woman, however,  called Maldonata, was artful enough to elude the vigilance of the guards,  and escape. After wandering about the country for a long time, she sought  for shelter in a cavern, but she had scarcely entered it when she espied a  lioness, the sight of which terrified her. She was, however, soon quieted  by the caresses of the animal, who, in return for a service rendered her,  showed every sign of affection and friendliness. She never returned from  searching after her own daily subsistence without laying a portion of it  at the feet of Maldonata, until her whelps being strong enough to walk  abroad, she took them out with her and never returned.    Some time after Maldonata fell into the hands of the Spaniards, and being  brought back to Buenos Ayres on the charge of having left the city  contrary to orders, the governor, a man of cruelty, condemned the  unfortunate woman to a death which none but the most cruel tyrant could  have thought of. He ordered some soldiers to take her into the country and  leave her tied to a tree, either to perish by hunger, or to be torn to  pieces by wild beasts, as he expected. Two days after, he sent the same  soldiers to see what was become of her; when, to their great surprise,  they found her alive and unhurt, though surrounded by lions and tigers,  which a lioness at her feet kept at some distance. As soon as the lioness  perceived the soldiers, she retired a little, and enabled them to unbind  Maldonata, who related to them the history of this lioness, whom she knew  to be the same she had formerly assisted in the cavern. On the soldiers  taking Maldonata away, the lioness fawned upon her as unwilling to part.  The soldiers reported what they had seen to the commander, who could not  but pardon a woman who had been so singularly protected, without appearing  more inhuman than lions themselves.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LIII.    A Good Finder.      One day a tradesman, walking with a friend, offered to wager that if he  were to hide a five-shilling piece in the dust, his dog would discover and  bring it to him. The wager was accepted, and the piece of money marked and  secreted. When the two had proceeded some distance, the tradesman called  to his dog that he had lost something, and ordered him to seek it. The dog  immediately turned back, and his master and his companion pursued their  walk. Meanwhile a traveller, driving in a small chaise, perceived the  piece of money which his horse had kicked from its hiding-place, alighted,  took it up, and drove to his inn. The dog had just reached the spot in  search of the lost piece, when the stranger picked it up. He followed the  chaise, went into the inn. Having scented out the coin in the pocket of  the traveller, he leaped up at him incessantly. Supposing him to be some  dog that had lost his master, the traveller regarded his movements as  marks of fondness; and as the animal was handsome, determined to keep him.  He gave him a good supper, and on retiring took him with him to his  chamber. No sooner had he pulled off his breeches than they were seized by  the dog; the owner, conceiving that he wanted to play with them, took them  away. The animal began to bark at the door, which the traveller opened,  thinking the dog wanted to go out. The dog snatched up the breeches and  away he flew, the traveller posting after him with his nightcap on. The  dog ran full speed to his master's house, followed by the stranger, who  accused the dog of robbing him. \"Sir,\" said the master, \"my dog is a very  faithful creature; and if he ran away with your breeches, it is because  you have in them money which does not belong to you.\" The traveller became  still more "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2434"],[0,"New Atlantis (#7)"],[1,", yet  thinking it decent that upon his pause of speech I should not be  altogether silent, said only this; \"That I would say to him, as the  widow of Sarepta said to Elias; that he was come to bring to memory our  sins; and that I confess the righteousness of Bensalem was greater than  the righteousness of Europe.\"  At which speech he bowed his head, and  went on in this manner:    \"They have also many wise and excellent laws touching marriage.  They  allow no polygamy.  They have ordained that none do intermarry or  contract, until a month be past from their first interview.  Marriage  without consent of parents they do not make void, but they mulct it in  the inheritors: for the children of such marriages are not admitted to  inherit above a third part of their parents' inheritance.  I have read  in a book of one of your men, of a Feigned Commonwealth, where the  married couple are permitted, before they contract, to see one another  naked.  This they dislike; for they think it a scorn to give a refusal  after so familiar knowledge: but because of many hidden defects in men  and women's bodies, they have a more civil way; for they have near  every town a couple of pools, (which they call Adam and Eve's pools,)  where it is permitted to one of the friends of the men, and another of  the friends of the woman, to see them severally bathe naked.\"    And as we were thus in conference, there came one that seemed to be a  messenger, in a rich huke, that spake with the Jew: whereupon he turned  to me and said; \"You will pardon me, for I am commanded away in haste.\"  The next morning he came to me again, joyful as it seemed, and said;  \"There is word come to the Governor of the city, that one of the  Fathers of Salomon's House will be here this day seven-night: we have  seen none of them this dozen years.  His coming is in state; but the  cause of his coming is secret.  I will provide you and your fellows of  a good standing to see his entry.\"  I thanked him, and told him, I was  most glad of the news.    The day being come, he made his entry.  He was a man of middle stature  and age, comely of person, and had an aspect as if he pitied men.  He  was clothed in a robe of fine black cloth, with wide sleeves and a  cape.  His under garment was of excellent white linen down to the foot,  girt with a girdle of the same; and a sindon or tippet of the same  about his neck.  He had gloves, that were curious,'' and set with  stone; and shoes of peach-coloured velvet.  His neck was bare to the  shoulders.  His hat was like a helmet, or Spanish montera; and his  locks curled below it decently: they were of colour brown.  His beard  was cut round, and of the same colour with his hair, somewhat lighter.  He was carried in a rich chariot without wheels, litter-wise; with two  horses at either end, richly trapped in blue velvet embroidered; and  two footmen on each side in the like attire.  The chariot was all of  cedar, gilt, and adorned with crystal; save that the fore-end had  panels of sapphires, set in borders of gold; and the hinder-end the  like of emeralds of the Peru colour.  There was also a sun of gold,  radiant, upon the top, in the midst; and on the top before, a small  cherub of gold, with wings displayed.  The chariot was covered with  cloth of gold tissued upon blue.  He had before him fifty attendants,  young men all, in white satin loose coats to the mid leg; and stockings  of white silk; and shoes of blue velvet; and hats of blue velvet; with  fine plumes of diverse colours, set round like hat-bands. Next before  the chariot, went two men, bare-headed, in linen garments down the  foot, girt, and shoes of blue velvet; who carried, the one a crosier,  the other a pastoral staff like a sheep-hook; neither of them of metal,  but the crosier of balm-wood, the pastoral staff of cedar. Horsemen he  had none, neither before nor behind his chariot: as it seemeth, to  avoid all tumult and trouble.  Behind his chariot went all the officers  and principals of the companies of the city.  He sat alone, upon  cushions of a kind of excellent plush, blue; and under his foot curious  carpets of silk of diverse colours, like the Persian, but far finer.  He held up his bare hand as he went, as blessing the people, but in  silence.  The street was wonderfully well kept: so that there was never  any army had their men stand in better battle-array than the people  stood.  The windows likewise were not crowded, but every one stood in  them as if they had been placed.    When the shew was past, the Jew said to me; \"I shall not be able to  attend you as I would, in regard of some charge the city hath laid upon  me, for the entertaining of this great person.\"  Three days after the  Jew came to me again, and said; \"Ye are happy men; for the Father of  Salomon's House taketh knowledge of your being here, and commanded me  to tell you that he will admit all your company to his presence, and  have private conference with one of you, that ye shall choose: and for  this hath appointed the next day after to-morrow.  And because he  meaneth to give you his blessing, he hath appointed it in the forenoon.\"    We came at our day and hour, and I was chosen by my fellows for the  private access.  We found him in a fair chamber, richly hanged, and  carpeted under foot without any degrees to the state.  He was set upon  a low Throne richly adorned, and a rich cloth of state over his head,  of blue satin embroidered.  He was alone, save that he had two pages of  honour, on either hand one, finely attired in white.  His under  garments were the like that we saw him wear in the chariot; but instead  of his gown, he had on him a mantle with a cape, of the same fine  black, fastened about him.  When we came in, as we were taught, we  bowed low at our first entrance; and when we were come near his chair,  he stood up, holding forth his hand ungloved, and in posture of  blessing; and we every one of us stooped down, and kissed the hem of  his tippet.  That done, the rest departed, and I remained.  Then he  warned the pages forth of the room, and caused me to sit down beside  him, and spake to me thus in the Spanish tongue.    \"God bless thee, my son; I will give thee the greatest jewel I have.  For I will impart unto thee, for the love of God and men, a relation of  the true state of Salomon's House.  Son, to make you know the true  state of Salomon's House, I will keep this order.  First, I will set  forth unto you the end of our foundation.  Secondly, the preparations  and instruments we have for our works.  Thirdly, the several  employments and functions whereto our fellows are assigned.  And  fourthly, the ordinances and rites which we observe.    \"The end of our foundation is the knowledge of causes, and secret  motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to  the effecting of all things possible.    \"The Preparations and Instruments are these.  We have large and deep  caves of several depths: the deepest are sunk six hundred fathom: and  some of them are digged and made under great hills and mountains: so  that if you reckon together the depth of the hill and the depth of the  cave, they are (some of them) above three miles deep.  For we find,  that the depth of a hill, and the depth of a cave from the flat, is the  same thing; both remote alike, from the sun and heaven's beams, and  from the open air.  These caves we call the Lower Region; and we use  them for all coagulations, indurations, refrigerations, and  conservations of bodies.  We use them likewise for the imitation of  natural mines; and the producing also of new artificial metals, by  compositions and materials which we use, and lay there for many years.  We use them also sometimes, (which may seem strange,) for curing of  some diseases, and for prolongation of life in some hermits that choose  to live there, well accommodated of all things necessary, and indeed  live very long; by whom also we learn many things.    \"We have burials in several earths, where we put diverse cements, as  the Chineses do their porcellain.  But we have them in greater variety,  and some of them more fine.  We have also great variety of composts and  soils, for the making of the earth fruitful.    \"We have high towers; the highest about half a mile in height; and some  of them likewise set upon high mountains; so that the vantage of the  hill with the tower is in the highest of them three miles at least. And  these places we call the Upper Region; accounting the air between the  high places and the low, as a Middle Region.  We use these towers,  according to their several heights, and situations, for insolation,  refrigeration, conservation; and for the view of divers meteors; as  winds, rain, snow, hail; and some of the fiery meteors also.  And upon  them, in some places, are dwellings of hermits, whom we visit  sometimes, and instruct what to observe.    \"We have great lakes, both salt, and fresh; whereof we have use for the  fish and fowl.  We use them also for burials of some natural bodies:  for we find a difference in things buried in earth or in air below the  earth, and things buried in water.  We have also pools, of which some  do strain fresh water out of salt; and others by art do turn fresh  water into salt.  We have also some rocks in the midst of the sea, and  some bays upon the shore for some works, wherein is required the air  and vapor of the sea.  We have likewise violent streams and cataracts,  which serve us for many motions: and likewise engines for multiplying  and enforcing of winds, to set also on going diverse motions.    \"We have also a number of artificial wells and fountains, made in  imitation of the natural sources and baths; as tincted upon vitriol,  sulphur, steel, brass, lead, nitre, and other minerals.  And again we  have little wells for infusions of many things, where the waters take  the virtue quicker and better, than in vessels or basins.  And amongst  "]]]
