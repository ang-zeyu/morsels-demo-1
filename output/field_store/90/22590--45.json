May 25th, he received large  re-enforcements from England.    On the night of June 16th a thousand men armed with pick and spade stole  out of the American camp. At dawn the startled British found that a  redoubt had sprung up in the night on Breed's Hill (henceforward Bunker  Hill) in Charlestown. Boston was endangered, and the rebels must be  dislodged. About half-past two 2,500 British regulars marched silently  and in perfect order up the hill, expecting to drive out the \"rustics\"  at the first charge. Colonel Prescott, the commanding American officer,  waited till the regulars were within ten rods. \"Fire!\" A sheet of flame  burst from the redoubt. The front ranks of the British melted away, and  His Majesty's invincibles retreated in confusion to the foot of the  hill. Again they advance. Again that terrible fire. Again they waver and  fall back. Once more the plucky fellows form for the charge, this time  with bayonets alone. When they are within twenty yards, the muskets  behind the earthworks send forth one deadly discharge, and then are  silent. The ammunition is exhausted. The British swarm into the redoubt.  The Continentals reluctantly retire, Prescott among the last, his coat  rent by bayonets. Joseph Warren, of Boston, the idol of Massachusetts,  was shot while leaving the redoubt. The British killed and wounded  amounted to 1,054--157 of them being officers; the American loss was  nearly 500. The battle put an end to further offensive movements by  Gage. It was a virtual victory for the untrained farmer troops, and all  America took courage.

Two days before, Congress had chosen George Washington  commander-in-chief, and on July 2d he arrived at Cambridge. Washington  was forty-three years old. Over six feet in height, and  well-proportioned, he combined great dignity with ease. His early life  as surveyor in a wild country had developed in him marvellous powers of  endurance. His experience in the French and Indian War had given him  considerable military knowledge. But his best title to the high honor  now thrust upon him lay in his wonderful self-control, sound judgment,  lofty patriotism, and sublime courage, which were to carry him, calm and  unflinching, through perplexities and discouragements that would have  overwhelmed a smaller or a meaner man.    Washington fought England with his hands tied. The Continental  government was the worst possible for carrying on war. There was no  executive. The action of legislative committees was slow and  vacillating, and at best Congress could not enforce obedience on the  part of a colony. Congress, too, afraid of a standing army, would  authorize only short enlistments, so that Washington had frequently to  discharge one army and form another in the face of the enemy. His troops  were ill-disciplined, and scantily supplied with clothing, tents,  weapons, and ammunition. Skilled officers were few, and these rarely  free from local and personal jealousies, impairing their efficiency.    [1776]    Washington found that the army around Boston consisted of about 14,500  men fit for duty. He estimated the British forces at 11,000. All the  fall and winter he was obliged to lie inactive for want of powder.  Meantime he distressed the British as much as possible by a close siege.  In the spring, having got more powder, he fortified Dorchester Heights.  The city was now untenable, and on March 17, 1776, all the British  troops, under command of Howe who had succeeded Gage, sailed out of  Boston harbor, never again to set foot on Massachusetts soil.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Joseph Warren.      June 28th, a British fleet of ten vessels opened fire on Fort Moultrie,  in Charleston harbor, S. C. The fort, commanded by Colonel Moultrie,  returned the fire with remarkable accuracy, and after an engagement of  twelve hours the fleet withdrew, badly crippled. This victory gave  security to South Carolina and Georgia for three years.    The discomfited fleet sailed for New York, where the British forces were  concentrating. The plan was to seize the Middle States, and thus keep  North and South from helping one another. August 1st, 2,500 English  troops and 8,000 Hessians arrived. The effective British force was now  about 25,000. Washington was holding New York City with about 10,000 men  fit for duty.    Driven from Long Island by the battle of August 27th, and forced to  abandon New York September 15th, Washington retreated up the Hudson, and  took up a strong position at White Plains. Here the British, attacking,  were defeated in a well-fought engagement; but as they were strongly  re-enforced on October 30th, Washington fell back to Newcastle. Early in  November, guessing that they intended to invade New Jersey and advance  on Philadelphia, he threw his main force across the Hudson.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  General Howe.      The fortunes of the American army were now at the lowest ebb, so that  had Howe been an efficient general it must have been either captured or  entirely destroyed. Through the treason of Adjutant Demont, who had  deserted to Lord Percy with complete information of their weakness,  Forts Washington and Lee were captured, November 16th and 20th, with the  loss of 150 killed and wounded, and 2,634 prisoners, besides valuable  stores, small arms, and forty-three pieces of artillery. Manhattan  Island was lost. General Charles Lee, with a considerable portion of the  army, persistently refused to cross the Hudson. Washington, with the  troops remaining, was forced to retreat slowly across New Jersey, the  British army, under Cornwallis, at his very heels, often within  cannon-shot. The New Jersey people were lukewarm, and many accepted  Cornwallis's offers of amnesty. Congress, fearing that Philadelphia  would be taken, adjourned to Baltimore. December 8th, Washington crossed  the Delaware with less than 3,000 men. The British encamped on the  opposite bank of the river. The American army was safe for the present,  having secured all the boats and burned all the bridges within seventy  miles.

Although intended for a caricature, this is considered an excellent  likeness.      Washington was soon re-enforced, and now had between five and six  thousand troops. He determined to strike a bold blow that would  electrify the drooping spirits of the army and the country. At Trenton  lay a body of 1,200 Hessians. Christmas night Washington crossed the  Delaware with 2,400 picked men. The current was swift, and the river  full of floating ice; but the boats were handled by Massachusetts  fishermen, and the passage was safely made. Then began the nine-mile  march to Trenton, in a blinding storm of sleet and hail. The soldiers,  many of whom were almost barefoot, stumbled on over the slippery road,  shielding their muskets from the storm as best they could. Trenton was  reached at eight o'clock on the morning of the 26th. An attack was made  by two columns simultaneously. The surprise was complete, and after a  half hour's struggle the Hessians surrendered. Nearly 1,000 prisoners  were taken, besides 1,200 small arms and six guns. Washington safely  retreated across the Delaware.    [1777]    Cornwallis, with 7,000 men, hurried from Princeton to attack the  American army. But Washington, on the night of January 2, 1777, leaving  his camp-fires burning, slipped around the British army, routed the  regiments left at Princeton, and pushing on northward went into winter  quarters at Morristown.    The next campaign opened late. It was the last of August when Howe, with  17,000 men, sailed from New York into Chesapeake Bay, and advanced  toward Philadelphia. Washington flung himself in his path at Brandywine,  September 11th, but was beaten back with heavy loss. September 26th the  British army marched into Philadelphia, whence Congress had fled.  October 4th, Washington attacked the British camp at Germantown. Victory  was almost his when two of the attacking parties, mistaking each other,  in the fog, for British, threw the movement into confusion, and  Washington had to fall back, with a loss of 1,000 men.    In December the American commander led his ragged army into winter  quarters at Valley Forge, twenty-one miles from Philadelphia. It was a  period of deep gloom. The war had been waged now for more than two  years, and less than nothing seemed to have been accomplished. Distrust  of Washington's ability sprang up in some minds. \"Heaven grant us one  great soul!\" exclaimed John Adams after Brandywine. Certain officers,  envious of Washington, began to intrigue for his place.    Meanwhile the army was shivering in its log huts at Valley Forge. Nearly  three thousand were barefoot. Many had to sit by the fires all night to  keep from freezing. One day there was a dinner of officers to which none  were admitted who had whole trousers. For days together there was no  bread in camp. The death-rate increased thirty-three per cent from week  to week.    Just now, however, amid this terrible Winter at Valley Forge, Baron  Steuben, a  trained German soldier, who had been a pupil of Frederick  the Great, joined our army. Washington made him inspector-general, and  his rigorous daily drill vastly improved the discipline and the spirits  of the American troops. When they left camp in the spring, spite of the  hardships past, they formed a military force on which Washington could  reckon with certainty for efficient work.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22581"],[0,"The Child-Voice in Singing (#7)"],[1,"exercises appears.    Scale drill may be carried on as follows: If the scales are written upon  a blackboard staff, they may from day to day be in different keys. It is  a very easy matter to extend the scale neither above nor below the  pitches within which it is desired to confine the voice. For example,  the scale of E or F may be written complete, that of G as follows:        [Music: {scale in G running down to e' and up to e''}]    or A        [Music: {scale in A running down to e' and up to f#''}]    or B{b}        [Music: {scale in B{b} running down to e{b}' and up to f''}]    and so on. Now let the teacher with a pointer direct the singing of the  class upon the selected scale in such a manner as to secure the desired  result in tone, and incidentally a familiarity with pitch relations,  etc. Of course, if charts are used the trouble of writing scales is  saved, only it is advised that the notes lying outside the prescribed  compass be omitted in the lower grades entirely, and in the upper until  the habit of good tone is established, when, of course, the tones may be  carried below E with safety. The extent and variety of vocal drill which  can be given with a pointer and a scale of notes is wonderful; but  nothing more need be now suggested, than those exercises which are  peculiarly intended to secure good tone, and fix good vocal habits,  although it must be evident that all such drill is very far-reaching in  its effects.    A few exercises which are very simple are here suggested. First, taking  the scale of        [Music: {scale in F running down to e' and up to f''}]    for example. Let the teacher, after the pitch of the keynote is given to  the class, place the pointer upon F, and slowly moving it from note to  note, ascend and descend the scale, the class singing a continuous tone  upon some vowel, _o_ for instance. The pointer should be passed from  note to note in such a manner that the eye can easily follow it. If the  notes are indicated to the class by a series of dabs at the chart or  blackboard, the pointer each time being carried away from the note  several inches, and then aimed at the next note and so on, the eye  becomes weary in trying to follow its movements, and the mental energy  of the pupils, which should be concentrated upon tone, is wasted in  watching the gyrations of the pointer. If, on the other hand, the  pointer is made to glide from note to note, passing very quickly over  intervening spaces, then the eye is not wearied in trying to follow it.  These directions may seem pretty trivial, but practical experience has  proved their importance. The vowel _o_ is suggested because it has been  found easier to secure the use of the head-register with this vowel than  with _ah_, when it is sought to break up the habit of singing loudly and  coarsely.    The term continuous tone used to describe the style of singing desired  is meant literally. If the class in this scale-drill all stop and take  breath at the same time, making frequent breaks in the continuity of the  tone, there will be found with each new attack a tendency to increase in  volume of sound. For certain reasons, which will be explained in the  chapter on breath-management, the attack of tone will become more and  more explosive, demanding constant repression. This irritating tendency  may, in a short time, be almost entirely overcome, if, instead of  letting the class take breath and attack simultaneously, each pupil is  told to take breath only when he or she is obliged to, and then at once  and softly to join again with the others. This will effect the  continuous tone, useful not alone as a corrective for the tendencies to  loud singing, but also to establish good breathing-habits.    This same swift, silent breath-taking and succeeding soft attack of tone  must be insisted upon in _all_ school singing.    The exercise already suggested is slow singing or rapid singing of the  scale with the vowel _o_ softly, and with continuous tones. Other simple  exercises are obtained by repetitions of the following exercise figures  at higher or lower pitches throughout an entire scale, or parts of a  scale, ascending and descending progressively:      [Transcriber's Note:      The exercises in Figure I are in the key of F in 4/4 time; those in    Figure II are in E, 6/8 time; and those in Figure III are in B{b},    4/4 time on eighth notes. All text is from the original.]    FIGURE I.        [Music: Ascending.      (Same figure tone higher.)      (Again raised.) etc.]        [Music: Descending.      (Same figure tone lower.)      (Again lowered) etc.]    The next figure, in which the voice ascends or descends four tones at  each progressive repetition, has a different rhythm.    FIGURE II.        [Music: Ascending.      (Same figure raised.)      (Again raised.) etc.]        [Music: Descending.      (Same, tone lower.)      (Still lower.) etc.]    Another exercise figure is to use five ascending and descending tones.    In the illustration which follows, in the key of B flat, it is shown how  the exercises may be sung, beginning upon the keynote, and keeping  within the voice-compass.        [Music: FIGURE III. etc.]        [Music: (Same Ex. inverted.) etc.]    These exercises are to be sung with vowel-sounds, softly, four measures  with one breath, if possible, and in strict time.    Only so many of these tone-groups may be sung in any one scale, as lie  within the extremes of pitch set for the grade, but if different scales  and upward and downward extensions of the same be used, then all  possible combinations of tones in the major scale may be sung, that is,  these exercise figures may upon a piano be repeated seven times in _any_  key, in phrases of four measures each, both ascending and descending,  but, owing to the limitations of the vocal compass, only a certain  number of ascending or descending phrases can be _sung_ in any one key.    While it is suggested that drill upon these musical figures or groups of  tones may be given from scales, the teacher tracing out the tones with a  pointer with a rhythmical movement, yet it is still better to practice  these groups or some of them from memory, the teacher keeping time for  and directing the class.        [NOTE.--The directions given are for rooms in which the teacher      has only a pitch pipe or tuning-fork to get pitch from. If there      is a piano the drill work for tone will be conducted a little      differently.]    Pages of musical phrases adapted to vocal drill might be given, but to  what end except to produce confusion. Our greatest singers use but few  exercises to keep their voices in good condition, but they practice them  very often. The exercises suggested are intended for daily practice, and  the fewer in number and simpler in form they are, the better will be the  results in tone. This vocal drill which should precede or begin the  daily music lesson must not be for over five minutes at most. Half of  that time is enough, if it be spent in singing, and not frittered away  in useless talk, and questions and answers. A practical application of  the vocal drill is to be made to the note-singing from the book and  chart, and to the school repertoire of songs.    The phrases voice-culture, voice-training, voice-development, etc., have  been avoided in treating the subject of children's voices, because of  possible misapprehension of their intended meaning. The terms are not,  of course, inapplicable to children's voices, but they must convey quite  a different significance than they do when applied to the adult voice.  In each case, the end of voice-culture is the formation of correct vocal  habits; but it would seem, that while it is possible to develop the  adult voice very considerably in power, range and flexibility, we ought,  in dealing with children's voices, to adopt those methods which will  protect weak and growing organs. The aim is not more power, but beauty  and purity rather. It should not be inferred that beauty of tone is not  equally the aim in culture of the adult voice, but in that case it is  consistent with development of strength and brilliancy of voice, while  with young children it is not. If the tone is clear, beautiful, well  poised, and under the singer's control, then the training is along safe  lines. If the tone is bad, harsh, pinched or throaty, then the training  is along unsafe lines. When the parts act harmoniously together, and  there is a proper and normal adjustment of all the organs concerned in  the production of tone, the result is good. Bad tone follows from the  ill-adjustment of the parts concerned in voice production. It is the  office of the teacher to correct this ill-adjustment and bring about a  perfect, or nearly perfect functional action. The teacher must judge of  the proper or improper action of the parts concerned in tone production  by the sense of hearing. No accumulation of scientific knowledge can  take the place of a careful and alert critical faculty in training  voice. Tone color must guide the school teacher in determining register  as it does the professional voice trainer. But we can also call the  mental perceptions of the child to our aid, and will find a more lively  sense of discrimination in tone quality than the average adult shows. We  can encourage the growth of high ideals of tone-beauty. We can cultivate  nice discrimination. We can, in short, use music in our schools not to  dull, but to quicken, the musical sensibilities of childhood.          CHAPTER IV.    COMPASS OF THE CHILD-VOICE.      There is the greatest diversity of opinion upon this subject among those  who have any opinion at all. It might be supposed that, among the  thousands of educators who are interested in school music and in the  singing of children generally, many might be found who have given the  subject careful attention, but such does not appear to be the case.
