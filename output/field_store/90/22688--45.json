I  couldn't get a chanst when you was in, but as soon as you went I  slipped out by the porch door and followed you. You went so fast I  near died trying to head you off.\"    \"You dear little soul,\" said Murray, suddenly radiant. \"It is too bad  you have had to put yourself so out of breath on my account. But I am  immensely obliged to you. The next time your young man wants a trusty  private messenger just refer him to me.\"    \"Git away with you,\" giggled Mollie. \"I must hurry back 'fore Aunt  Emily Jane gits wind I'm gone. I hope there's good news in your girl's  letter. My, but didn't you look flat when Aunt said she'd went!\"    Murray beamed at her idiotically. When she had vanished among the  trees he opened his letter.        \"Dear Mr. Murray,\" it ran, \"your unblushing audacity of the      morning deserves some punishment. I hereby punish you by      prompt departure from Orchard Knob. Yet I do not dislike      audacity, at some times, in some places, in some people. It is      only from a sense of duty that I punish it in this case. And      it was really pleasant in Eden. If you do not mail that      letter, and if you still persist in your very absurd      interpretation of the meaning of Eve's kiss, we may meet again      in town. Until then I remain,                                       \"Very sincerely yours,                                       \"Dora Lynne Mannering.\"    Murray kissed the grey letter and put it tenderly away in his pocket.  Then he took his letter to his uncle and tore it into tiny fragments.  Finally he looked at his watch.    \"If I hurry, I can catch the afternoon train to town,\" he said.          Aunt Susanna's Birthday Celebration      Good afternoon, Nora May. I'm real glad to see you. I've been watching  you coming down the hill and I hoping you'd turn in at our gate. Going  to visit with me this afternoon? That's good. I'm feeling so happy and  delighted and I've been hankering for someone to tell it all to.    Tell you about it? Well, I guess I might as well. It ain't any breach  of confidence.    You didn't know Anne Douglas? She taught school here three years ago,  afore your folks moved over from Talcott. She belonged up Montrose way  and she was only eighteen when she came here to teach. She boarded  with us and her and me were the greatest chums. She was just a sweet  girl.    She was the prettiest teacher we ever had, and that's saying a good  deal, for Springdale has always been noted for getting good-looking  schoolmarms, just as Miller's Road is noted for its humly ones.    Anne had _yards_ of brown wavy hair and big, dark blue eyes. Her face  was kind o' pale, but when she smiled you would have to smile too, if  you'd been chief mourner at your own funeral. She was a well-spring of  joy in the house, and we all loved her.    Gilbert Martin began to drive her the very first week she was here.  Gilbert is my sister Julia's son, and a fine young fellow he is. It  ain't good manners to brag of your own relations, but I'm always  forgetting and doing it. Gil was a great pet of mine. He was so bright  and nice-mannered everybody liked him. Him and Anne were a  fine-looking couple, Nora May. Not but what they had their  shortcomings. Anne's nose was a mite too long and Gil had a crooked  mouth. Besides, they was both pretty proud and sperrited and  high-strung.    But they thought an awful lot of each other. It made me feel young  again to see 'em. Anne wasn't a mossel vain, but nights she expected  Gil she'd prink for hours afore her glass, fixing her hair this way  and that, and trying on all her good clothes to see which become her  most. I used to love her for it. And I used to love to see the way  Gil's face would light up when she came into a room or place where he  was. Amanda Perkins, she says to me once, \"Anne Douglas and Gil Martin  are most terrible struck on each other.\" And she said it in a tone  that indicated that it was a dreadful disgraceful and unbecoming state  of affairs. Amanda had a disappointment once and it soured her. I  immediately responded, \"Yes, they are most terrible struck on each  other,\" and I said it in a tone that indicated I thought it a most  beautiful and lovely thing that they should be so.    And so it was. You're rather too young to be thinking of such things,  Nora May, but you'll remember my words when the time comes.    Another nephew of mine, James Ebenezer Lawson--he calls himself James  E. back there in town, and I don't blame him, for I never could stand  Ebenezer for a name myself; but that's neither here nor there. Well,  he said their love was idyllic, I ain't very sure what that means. I  looked it up in the dictionary after James Ebenezer left--I wouldn't  display my ignorance afore him--but I can't say that I was much the  wiser for it. Anyway, it meant something real nice; I was sure of that  by the way James Ebenezer spoke and the wistful look in his eyes.  James Ebenezer isn't married; he was to have been, and she died a  month afore the wedding day. He was never the same man again.    Well, to get back to Gilbert and Anne. When Anne's school year ended  in June she resigned and went home to get ready to be married. The  wedding was to be in September, and I promised Anne faithful I'd go  over to Montrose in August for two weeks and help her to get her  quilts ready. Anne thought that nobody could quilt like me. I was as  tickled as a girl at the thought of visiting with Anne for two weeks,  but I never went; things happened before August.    I don't know rightly how the trouble began. Other folks--jealous  folks--made mischief. Anne was thirty miles away and Gilbert couldn't  see her every day to keep matters clear and fair. Besides, as I've  said, they were both proud and high-sperrited. The upshot of it was  they had a terrible quarrel and the engagement was broken.    When two people don't care overly much for each other, Nora May, a  quarrel never amounts to much between them, and it's soon made up. But  when they love each other better than life it cuts so deep and hurts  so much that nine times out of ten they won't ever forgive each other.  The more you love anybody, Nora May, the more he can hurt you. To be  sure, you're too young to be thinking of such things.    It all came like a thunderclap on Gil's friends here at Greendale,  because we hadn't ever suspected things were going wrong. The first  thing we knew was that Anne had gone up west to teach school again at  St. Mary's, eighty miles away, and Gilbert, he went out to Manitoba on  a harvest excursion and stayed there. It just about broke his parents'  hearts. He was their only child and they just worshipped him.    Gil and Anne both wrote to me off and on, but never a word, not so  much as a name, did they say of each other. I'd 'a' writ and asked 'em  the rights of the fuss if I could, in hopes of patching it up, but I  can't write now--my hand is too shaky--and mebbe it was just as well,  for meddling is terribly risky work in a love trouble, Nora May.  Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the last state of a meddler and  them she meddles with is worse than the first.    So I just set tight and said nothing, while everybody else in the clan  was talking Anne and Gil sixty words to the minute.    Well, last birthday morning I was feeling terrible disperrited. I had  made up my mind that my birthday was always to be a good thing for  other people, and there didn't seem one blessed thing I could do to  make anybody glad. Emma Matilda and George and the children were all  well and happy and wanted for nothing that I could give them. I begun  to be afraid I'd lived long enough, Nora May. When a woman gets to the  point where she can't give a gift of joy to anyone, there ain't much  use in her living. I felt real old and worn out and useless.    I was sitting here under these very trees--they was just budding out  in leaf then, as young and cheerful as if they wasn't a hundred years  old. And I sighed right out loud and said, \"Oh, Grandpa Holland, it's  time I was put away up on the hill there with you.\" And with that the  gate banged and there was Nancy Jane Whitmore's boy, Sam, with two  letters for me.    One was from Anne up at St. Mary's and the other was from Gil out in  Manitoba.    I read Anne's first. She just struck right into things in the first  paragraph. She said her year at St. Mary's was nearly up, and when it  was she meant to quit teaching and go away to New York and learn to be  a trained nurse. She said she was just broken-hearted about Gilbert,  and would always love him to the day of her death. But she knew he  didn't care anything more about her after the way he had acted, and  there was nothing left for her in life but to do something for other  people, and so on and so on, for twelve mortal pages. Anne is a fine  writer, and I just cried like a babe over that letter, it was so  touching, although I was enjoying myself hugely all the time, I was so  delighted to find out that Anne loved Gilbert still. I was getting  skeered she didn't, her letters all winter had been so kind of jokey  and frivolous, all about the good times she was having, and the  parties she went to, and the new dresses she got. New dresses! When I  read that letter of Anne's, I knew that all the purple and fine linen  in the world was just like so much sackcloth and ashes to her as long  as Gilbert was sulking out on a prairie farm.    Well, I wiped my eyes and polished up my specs, but I might have  spared myself the trouble, for in five minutes, Nora May, there was I  sobbing again; over Gilbert's letter. By the most curious coincidence  he had opened his heart to me too. Being a man, he wasn't so  discursive as Anne; he said his say in four pages, but I could read  the heartache between the lines. He wrote that he was going to  Klondike and would start in a month's time. He was sick of living now  that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24877"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1907 to 1908 (#7)"],[1,"six weeks. Then came one,  alarmed at Anna's silence, anxiously asking the reason for it; Gilbert  had heard no word of the marriage. He was working in a remote district  where newspapers seldom penetrated. He had no other correspondent in  Exeter now; except his mother, and she, not knowing that he supposed  himself engaged to Anna had forgotten to mention it.    Alma answered that letter. She told herself recklessly that she would  keep on writing to him until he found out. She would lose his  friendship anyhow, when that occurred, but meanwhile she would have  the letters a little longer. She could not learn to live without them  until she had to.    The correspondence slipped back into its old groove. The harassed look  which Alma's face had worn, and which Exeter people had attributed to  worry over Anna, disappeared. She did not even feel lonely, and  reproached herself for lack of proper feeling in missing Anna so  little. Besides, to her horror and dismay, she detected in herself a  strange undercurrent of relief at the thought that Gilbert could never  marry Anna now! She could not understand it. Had not that marriage  been her dearest wish for years? Why then should she feel this strange  gladness at the impossibility of its fulfilment? Altogether, Alma  feared that her condition of mind and morals must be sadly askew.  Perhaps, she thought mournfully, this perversion of proper feeling was  her punishment for the deception she had practised. She had  deliberately done evil that good might come, and now the very  imaginations of her heart were stained by that evil. Alma cried  herself to sleep many a night in her repentance, but she kept on  writing to Gilbert, for all that.    The winter passed, and the spring and summer waned, and Alma's outward  life flowed as smoothly as the currents of the seasons, broken only by  vivid eruptions from Anna, who came over often from East Exeter,  glorying in her young matronhood, \"to cheer Alma up.\" Alma, so said  Exeter people, was becoming unsociable and old maidish. She lost her  liking for company, and seldom went anywhere among her neighbours. Her  once frequent visits across the yard to chat with old Mrs. Murray  became few and far between. She could not bear to hear the old lady  talking about Gilbert, and she was afraid that some day she would be  told that he was coming home. Gilbert's home-coming was the nightmare  dread that darkened poor Alma's whole horizon.           *       *       *       *       *    One October day, two years after Gilbert's departure, Alma, standing  at her window in the reflected glow of a red maple outside, looked  down the lane and saw him striding up it! She had had no warning of  his coming. His last letter, dated three weeks back, had not hinted at  it. Yet there he was--and with him Alma's Nemesis.    She was very calm. Now that the worst had come, she felt quite strong  to meet it. She would tell Gilbert the truth, and he would go away in  anger and never forgive her, but she deserved it. As she went  downstairs, the only thing that really worried her was the thought of  the pain Gilbert would suffer when she told him of Anna's  faithlessness. She had seen his face as he passed under her window,  and it was the face of a blithe man who had not heard any evil  tidings. It was left to her to tell him; surely, she thought  apathetically, that was punishment enough for what she had done.    With her hand on the doorknob, she paused to wonder what she should  say when he asked her why she had not told him of Anna's marriage when  it occurred--why she had still continued the deception when it had no  longer an end to serve. Well, she would tell him the truth--that it  was because she could not bear the thought of giving up writing to  him. It was a humiliating thing to confess, but that did not  matter--nothing mattered now. She opened the door.    Gilbert was standing on the big round door-stone under the red  maple--a tall, handsome young fellow with a bronzed face and laughing  eyes. His exile had improved him. Alma found time and ability to  reflect that she had never known Gilbert was so fine-looking.    He put his arm around her and kissed her cheek in his frank delight at  seeing her again. Alma coldly asked him in. Her face was still as pale  as when she came downstairs, but a curious little spot of fiery red  blossomed out where Gilbert's lips had touched it.    Gilbert followed her into the sitting-room and looked about eagerly.    \"When did you come home?\" she said slowly. \"I did not know you were  expected.\"    \"Got homesick, and just came! I wanted to surprise you all,\" he  answered, laughing. \"I arrived only a few minutes ago. Just took time  to hug my mother, and here I am. Where's Anna?\"    The pent-up retribution of two years descended on Alma's head in the  last question of Gilbert's. But she did not flinch. She stood straight  before him, tall and fair and pale, with the red maple light streaming  in through the open door behind her, staining her light house-dress  and mellowing the golden sheen of her hair. Gilbert reflected that  Alma Williams was really a very handsome girl. These two years had  improved her. What splendid big grey eyes she had! He had always  wished that Anna's eyes had not been quite so black.    \"Anna is not here,\" said Alma. \"She is married.\"    \"Married!\"    Gilbert sat down suddenly on a chair and looked at Alma in  bewilderment.    \"She has been married for a year,\" said Alma steadily. \"She married  Charlie Moore of East Exeter, and has been living there ever since.\"    \"Then,\" said Gilbert, laying hold of the one solid fact that loomed  out of the mist of his confused understanding, \"why did she keep on  writing letters to me after she was married?\"    \"She never wrote to you at all. It was I that wrote the letters.\"    Gilbert looked at Alma doubtfully. Was she crazy? There was something  odd about her, now that he noticed, as she stood rigidly there, with  that queer red spot on her face, a strange fire in her eyes, and that  weird reflection from the maple enveloping her like an immaterial  flame.    \"I don't understand,\" he said helplessly.    Still standing there, Alma told the whole story, giving full  explanations, but no excuses. She told it clearly and simply, for she  had often pictured this scene to herself and thought out what she must  say. Her memory worked automatically, and her tongue obeyed it  promptly. To herself she seemed like a machine, talking mechanically,  while her soul stood on one side and listened.    When she had finished there was a silence lasting perhaps ten seconds.  To Alma it seemed like hours. Would Gilbert overwhelm her with angry  reproaches, or would he simply rise up and leave her in unutterable  contempt? It was the most tragic moment of her life, and her whole  personality was strung up to meet it and withstand it.    \"Well, they were good letters, anyhow,\" said Gilbert finally;  \"interesting letters,\" he added, as if by way of a meditative  afterthought.    It was so anti-climactic that Alma broke into an hysterical giggle,  cut short by a sob. She dropped into a chair by the table and flung  her hands over her face, laughing and sobbing softly to herself.  Gilbert rose and walked to the door, where he stood with his back to  her until she regained her self-control. Then he turned and looked  down at her quizzically.    Alma's hands lay limply in her lap, and her eyes were cast down, with  tears glistening on the long fair lashes. She felt his gaze on her.    \"Can you ever forgive me, Gilbert?\" she said humbly.    \"I don't know that there is much to forgive,\" he answered. \"I have  some explanations to make too and, since we're at it, we might as well  get them all over and have done with them. Two years ago I did  honestly think I was in love with Anna--at least when I was round  where she was. She had a taking way with her. But, somehow, even then,  when I wasn't with her she seemed to kind of grow dim and not count  for so awful much after all. I used to wish she was more like  you--quieter, you know, and not so sparkling. When I parted from her  that last night before I went west, I did feel very bad, and she  seemed very dear to me, but it was six weeks from that before  her--your--letter came, and in that time she seemed to have faded out  of my thoughts. Honestly, I wasn't thinking much about her at all.  Then came the letter--and it was a splendid one, too. I had never  thought that Anna could write a letter like that, and I was as pleased  as Punch about it. The letters kept coming, and I kept on looking for  them more and more all the time. I fell in love all over again--with  the writer of those letters. I thought it was Anna, but since you  wrote the letters, it must have been with you, Alma. I thought it was  because she was growing more womanly that she could write such  letters. That was why I came home. I wanted to get acquainted all over  again, before she grew beyond me altogether--I wanted to find the real  Anna the letters showed me. I--I--didn't expect this. But I don't care  if Anna is married, so long as the girl who wrote those letters isn't.  It's you I love, Alma.\"    He bent down and put his arm about her, laying his cheek against hers.  The little red spot where his kiss had fallen was now quite drowned  out in the colour that rushed over her face.    \"If you'll marry me, Alma, I'll forgive you,\" he said.    A little smile escaped from the duress of Alma's lips and twitched her  dimples.    \"I'm willing to do anything that will win your forgiveness, Gilbert,\"  she said meekly.          Aunt Caroline's Silk Dress      Patty came in from her walk to the post office with cheeks finely  reddened by the crisp air. Carry surveyed her with pleasure. Of late  Patty's cheeks had been entirely too pale to please Carry, and Patty  had not had a very good appetite. Once or twice she had even  complained of a headache."]]]
