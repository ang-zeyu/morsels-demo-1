Their division and multiplication is an  essential condition, of growth. Through an unfortunate accident, these  protoplasmic blebs, which constitute the living basis of the animal  body, have come to be styled \"cells,\" though the term \"corpuscles\" is  far more appropriate.      Section 54. The word is \"cell\" suggests something enclosed by firm  and definite walls, and it was first employed in vegetable histology.  Unlike the typical cells of animals, the cells of most plants are not  naked protoplasm, but protoplasm enclosed in a wall of substance  (cell wall) called cellulose. The presence of this cellulose cell wall,  and the consequent necessity of feeding entirely upon liquids and  gases that soak through it instead of being able to ingest a portion of  solid food is indeed, the primary distinction between the  vegetable and the animal kingdoms, as ordinarily considered.      Section 55. Throughout life, millions of these cells retain their  primary characters, and constitute the white corpuscles of blood,  \"phagocytes,\" and connective tissue corpuscles; others again,  engage in the formation of material round themselves, and lie, in  such cases, as gristle and bone, embedded in the substance they  have formed; others again, undergo great changes in form and internal  structure, and become permanently modified into, for instance, nerve  fibres and muscle substance. The various substances arising in this  way through the activity of cells are called tissues, the building  materials of that complex thing, the animal body. Since such a  creature as the rabbit is formed through the co-operation of a vast  multitude of cells, it is called multicellular; the amoeba, on the other  hand, is unicellular. The rabbit may be thus regarded as a vast  community of amoeboid creatures and their products.      Section 56. Figure IV., Sheet 3 represents, diagrammatically,  embryonic tissue, of which, to begin with, the whole animal  consists. The cells are all living, capable of dividing and similar, but as  development proceeds, they differentiate, some take on one kind of  duty (function), and some another, like boys taking to different  trades on leaving school, and wide differences in structure and  interdependence become apparent.      Section 57. It is convenient to divide tissues into three classes,  though the divisions are by no means clearly marked, nor have they  any scientific value. The first of these comprises tissues composed  wholly, or with the exception of an almost imperceptible cementing  substance, of cells; the second division includes the skeletal tissues,  the tissue of mesentery, and the connective and basement tissue of  most of the organs, tissues which, generally speaking, consist of a  matrix or embedding substance, formed by the cells and outside of  them, as well as the cells themselves; and, thirdly, muscular and  nervous tissue. We shall study the former two in this chapter, and  defer the third division until later.      Section 58. The outer layer of the skin (the epidermis), the inmost  lining of the alimentary canal, the lining of the body cavity, and the  inner linings of blood-vessels, glands, and various ducts constitute our  first division. The general name for such tissues is epithelium. When  the cells are more or less flattened, they form squamous epithelium  (Figure VI.) such as we find lining the inside of a man's cheek (from  which the cells sq.ep. were taken) or covering the mesentery of  various types-- sq.end. are from the mesentery (Section 16) of a frog.  A short cylindroidal form of cell makes up columnar epithelium, seen  typically in the cells covering the villi of the duodenum (Figure V.).  This epithelium of the villi has the outer border curiously striated, and  this is usually spoken of as leading towards \"ciliated\" epithelium, to  be described immediately. The epithelium of the epididermis is  stratified-- that is to say, has many thicknesses of cells; the deeper  layers are alive and dividing (stratum mucosum), while the more  superficial are increasingly flattened and drier as the surface is  approached (stratum corneum) and are continually being rubbed off  and replaced from below.      Section 59. In the branching air-tubes of the lung, the central canal of  the spinal cord, and in the ureters of the rabbit, and in most other  types, in various organs, we find ciliated epithelium (Figure VII.).  This is columnar or cubical in form, and with the free edge curiously  modified and beset with a number of hair-like processes, the cilia, by  which, during the life of the cell, a waving motion is sustained in one  direction. This motion assists in maintaining a current in the contents  of ducts which are lined with this tissue. The motion is independent of  the general life of the animal, so long as the constituent cell still  lives, and so it is easy for the student to witness it himself with a  microscope having a 1/4-inch or 1/6-inch objective. Very fine cilia may  be seen by gently scraping the roof of a frog's mouth (the cells figured  are from this source), or the gill of a recently killed mussel, and  mounting at once in water, or, better, in a very weak solution of  common salt.      Section 60. The lining of glands is secretory epithelium; the cells  are usually cubical or polygonal (8, g.ep.), and they display in the  most characteristic form what is called metabolism. Anaboly (see  Section 14) we have defined, as a chemical change in an upward  direction-- less stable and more complex compounds are built up in  the processes of vegetable and animal activity towards protoplasm;  kataboly is a chemical running down; metaboly is a more general  term, covering all vital chemical changes. The products of the action  of a glandular epithelium are metabolic products, material derived from  the blood is worked, up within the cell, not necessarily with  conspicuous gain or loss of energy, and discharged into the gland  space. The most striking case of this action is in the \"goblet cells\"  that are found among the villi; these are simply glands of one cell,  unicellular glands, and in Figure V. we see three stages in their  action: at g.c.1 material (secretion) is seen forming in the cell, at  g.c.2 it approaches the outer border, and at g.c.3 it has been  discharged, leaving a hollowed cell. Usually however, the escape of  secreted matter is not so conspicuous, and the gland-cells are  collected as the lining of pits, simple, as in the gastric, pyloric, and  Lieberkuhnian glands (Figure VIII., Sections 23, 29), or branching  like a tree or a bunch of grapes (Figure r.g.), as in Brunner's glands  (Section 29) the pancreas, and the salivary glands. The salivary  glands, we may mention, are a pair internal to the posterior ventral  angle of the jaw, the sub-maxillary; a pair anterior to these, the  sub-lingual; a pair posterior to the jaw beneath the ear, the parotid,  and a pair beneath the eye, the infra orbital.      Section 61. The liver is the most complicated gland in the body  (Figure X.). The bile duct (b.d.) branches again and again, and ends at  last in the final pits, the lobuli (lb.), which are lined with secretory  epithelium, and tightly packed, and squeeze each other into polygonal  forms. The blood supply from which the bile would appear to be  mainly extracted, is brought by the portal vein, but this blood is  altogether unfit for the nutrition of the liver tissue; for this latter  purpose a branch of the coeliac artery, the hepatic serves. Hence in  the tissue of the liver we have, branching and interweaving among  the lobuli, the small branches of the bile duct (b.d.), which carries  away the bile formed, the portal vein (p.v.), the hepatic artery (h.a.),  and the hepatic vein (h.v.). (Compare Section 45.) Figure X.b shows  a lobule; the portal vein and the artery ramify round the lobules-- are  inter-lobular, that is (inter, between); the hepatic vein begins in  the middle of the lobules (intra-lobular), and receives their blood.  (Compare X.a.) Besides its function in the manufacture of the  excretory, digestive, and auxiliary bile, the liver performs other  duties. It appears to act as an inspector of the assimilation material  brought in by the portal vein. The villi, for instance, will absorb  arsenic, but this is arrested and thrown down in the liver. A third  function is the formation of what would seem to be a store of  carbo-hydrate, glycogen, mainly it would appear, from the sugar in the  portal vein, though also, very probably, from nitrogenous material, though  this may occur only under exceptional conditions. Finally, the nitrogenous  katastates, formed in the working of muscle and nerve, and returned  by them to the blood for excretion, are not at that stage in the form of  urea. Whatever form they assume, they undergo a further metabolism  into urea before leaving the body, and the presence of considerable  quantities of this latter substance in the liver suggests this as a fourth  function of this organ-- the elaboration of urea.      Section 62. Similar from a physiological point of view, to the secretory  glands which form the digestive fluids are those which furnish  lubricating fluids, the lachrymal gland, and Harderian glands  in the orbit internally to the eye, and posterior and anterior to it  respectively, the sebaceous glands (oil glands) connected with the  hair, and the anal and perineal glands. The secretions of excretory  glands are removed from the body; chief among them are the sweat  glands and kidneys. The sweat glands are microscopic tubular  glands, terminating internally in a small coil (Figure VIII. s.g.) and  are scattered thickly over the body, the water of their secretion being  constantly removed by evaporation, and the small percentage of salt  and urea remaining to accumulate as dirt, and the chief reasonable  excuse for washing.
