It is not  strange, therefore, that wise men, weary of investigation, tormented by  uncertainty, longing to believe something, and yet seeing objections to  every thing, should submit themselves absolutely to teachers who, with  firm and undoubting faith, lay claim to a supernatural commission. Thus  we frequently see inquisitive and restless spirits take refuge from  their own scepticism in the bosom of a church which pretends to  infallibility, and, after questioning the existence of a Deity, bring  themselves to worship a wafer. And thus it was that Fox made some  converts to whom he was immeasurably inferior in every thing except the  energy of his convictions. By these converts his rude doctrines were  polished into a form somewhat less shocking to good sense and good  taste. No proposition which he had laid down was retracted. No indecent  or ridiculous act which he had done or approved was condemned; but what  was most grossly absurd in his theories and practices was softened down,  or at least not obtruded on the public; whatever could be made to appear  specious was set in the fairest light; his gibberish was translated into  English; meanings which he would have been quite unable to comprehend  were put on his phrases; and his system, so much improved that he would  not have known it again, was defended by numerous citations from Pagan  philosophers and Christian fathers whose names he had never heard.  [37] Still, however, those who had remodelled his theology continued  to profess, and doubtless to feel, profound reverence for him; and his  crazy epistles were to the last received and read with respect in Quaker  meetings all over the country. His death produced a sensation which was  not confined to his own disciples. On the morning of the funeral a  great multitude assembled round the meeting house in Gracechurch Street.  Thence the corpse was borne to the burial ground of the sect near  Bunhill Fields. Several orators addressed the crowd which filled the  cemetery. Penn was conspicuous among those disciples who committed the  venerable corpse to the earth. The ceremony had scarcely been finished  when he learned that warrants were out against him. He instantly took  flight, and remained many months concealed from the public eye. [38]    A short time after his disappearance, Sidney received from him a strange  communication. Penn begged for an interview, but insisted on a promise  that he should be suffered to return unmolested to his hiding place.  Sidney obtained the royal permission to make an appointment on these  terms. Penn came to the rendezvous, and spoke at length in his own  defence. He declared that he was a faithful subject of King William and  Queen Mary, and that, if he knew of any design against them, he would  discover it. Departing from his Yea and Nay, he protested, as in the  presence of God, that he knew of no plot, and that he did not believe  that there was any plot, unless the ambitious projects of the French  government might be called plots. Sidney, amazed probably by hearing  a person, who had such an abhorrence of lies that he would not use the  common forms of civility, and such an abhorrence of oaths that he would  not kiss the book in a court of justice, tell something very like a lie,  and confirm it by something very like an oath, asked how, if there were  really no plot, the letters and minutes which had been found on Ashton  were to be explained. This question Penn evaded. \"If,\" he said, \"I could  only see the King, I would confess every thing to him freely. I would  tell him much that it would be important for him to know. It is only  in that way that I can be of service to him. A witness for the Crown I  cannot be for my conscience will not suffer me to be sworn.\" He assured  Sidney that the most formidable enemies of the government were the  discontented Whigs. \"The Jacobites are not dangerous. There is not a man  among them who has common understanding. Some persons who came over from  Holland with the King are much more to be dreaded.\" It does not appear  that Penn mentioned any names. He was suffered to depart in safety. No  active search was made for him. He lay hid in London during some months,  and then stole down to the coast of Sussex and made his escape to  France. After about three years of wandering and lurking he, by the  mediation of some eminent men, who overlooked his faults for the sake  of his good qualities, made his peace with the government, and again  ventured to resume his ministrations. The return which he made for the  lenity with which he had been treated does not much raise his character.  Scarcely had he again begun to harangue in public about the unlawfulness  of war, when he sent a message earnestly exhorting James to make an  immediate descent on England with thirty thousand men. [39]    Some months passed before the fate of Preston was decided. After several  respites, the government, convinced that, though he had told much, he  could tell more, fixed a day for his execution, and ordered the sheriffs  to have the machinery of death in readiness. [40] But he was again  respited, and, after a delay of some weeks, obtained a pardon, which,  however, extended only to his life, and left his property subject to all  the consequences of his attainder. As soon as he was set at liberty  he gave new cause of offence and suspicion, and was again arrested,  examined and sent to prison. [41] At length he was permitted to retire,  pursued by the hisses and curses of both parties, to a lonely manor  house in the North Riding of Yorkshire. There, at least, he had not to  endure the scornful looks of old associates who had once thought him  a man of dauntless courage and spotless honour, but who now pronounced  that he was at best a meanspirited coward, and hinted their suspicions  that he had been from the beginning a spy and a trepan. [42] He employed  the short and sad remains of his life in turning the Consolation  of Boethius into English. The translation was published after the  translator's death. It is remarkable chiefly on account of some very  unsuccessful attempts to enrich our versification with new metres, and  on account of the allusions with which the preface is filled. Under  a thin veil of figurative language, Preston exhibited to the public  compassion or contempt his own blighted fame and broken heart. He  complained that the tribunal which had sentenced him to death had dealt  with him more leniently than his former friends, and that many, who  had never been tried by temptations like his, had very cheaply earned  a reputation for courage by sneering at his poltroonery, and by bidding  defiance at a distance to horrors which, when brought near, subdue even  a constant spirit.    The spirit of the Jacobites, which had been quelled for a time by the  detection of Preston's plot, was revived by the fall of Mons. The joy of  the whole party was boundless. The nonjuring priests ran backwards and  forwards between Sam's Coffee House and Westminster Hall, spreading  the praises of Lewis, and laughing at the miserable issue of the  deliberations of the great Congress. In the Park the malecontents wore  their biggest looks, and talked sedition in their loudest tones. The  most conspicuous among these swaggerers was Sir John Fenwick, who had,  in the late reign, been high in favour and in military command, and  was now an indefatigable agitator and conspirator. In his exultation he  forgot the courtesy which man owes to woman. He had more than once  made himself conspicuous by his impertinence to the Queen. He now  ostentatiously put himself in her way when she took her airing; and,  while all around him uncovered and bowed low, gave her a rude stare  and cocked his hat in her face. The affront was not only brutal, but  cowardly. For the law had provided no punishment for mere impertinence,  however gross; and the King was the only gentleman and soldier in the  kingdom who could not protect his wife from contumely with his sword.  All that the Queen could do was to order the parkkeepers not to admit  Sir John again within the gates. But, long after her death, a day came  when he had reason to wish that he had restrained his insolence. He  found, by terrible proof, that of all the Jacobites, the most desperate  assassins not excepted, he was the only one for whom William felt an  intense personal aversion. [43]    A few days after this event the rage of the malecontents began to  flame more fiercely than ever. The detection of the conspiracy of which  Preston was the chief had brought on a crisis in ecclesiastical  affairs. The nonjuring bishops had, during the year which followed their  deprivation, continued to reside in the official mansions which had  once been their own. Burnet had, at Mary's request, laboured to effect  a compromise. His direct interference would probably have done more harm  than good. He therefore judiciously employed the agency of Rochester,  who stood higher in the estimation of the nonjurors than any statesman  who was not a nonjuror, and of Trevor, who, worthless as he was, had  considerable influence with the High Church party. Sancroft and his  brethren were informed that, if they would consent to perform their  spiritual duty, to ordain, to institute, to confirm, and to watch over  the faith and the morality of the priesthood, a bill should be brought  into Parliament to excuse them from taking the oaths. [44] This offer  was imprudently liberal; but those to whom it was made could not  consistently accept it. For in the ordination service, and indeed in  almost every service of the Church, William and Mary were designated  as King and Queen. The only promise that could be obtained from the  deprived prelates was that they would live quietly; and even this  promise they had not all kept. One of them at least had been guilty of  treason aggravated by impiety. He had,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26196"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 3, February, 1851 (#7)"],[1,"celebrate the death of her husband. He comes and brings her  before a court, not for having rejoiced at his death, but for  infidelity, supposing that to be the only way in which she could have  discovered the secret of the assassin. She is condemned and executed,  but before dying, she reveals the whole mystery to a friend, who  afterwards informs Herod. The king devoured by rage and remorse and  driven to desperation, becomes merciless as a fury. It is at that  moment, that the three wise men from the East arrive, and inform him of  the birth of Christ; whereupon he orders the slaughter of the children.  One of the peculiarities of this tragedy, is the introduction of a  character, who takes no part in the action, but observes and  philosophizes upon it, somewhat after the manner of the old Greek  chorus. This innovation cannot be said to be successful; moreover there  is generally too much philosophizing and moralizing in the piece.    Another new German tragedy is called _Francisco da Rimini_, by Cornelius  Von der Heyse, but we know nothing more respecting it than is  communicated by the publisher's advertisement. The title is promising.    The French dramatists produce more comedies than tragedies. Indeed, in  the weekly notices which for the last few weeks our Parisian papers have  given of the new works brought out at the various theatres of Paris, we  have not observed one tragedy of importance enough for us to remark upon  it. But in the lighter range of comedy, the French playwrights are  unequalled and inexhaustible, as is proved by the constant transfer of  their productions into both the English and German languages. They do  not think it necessary to have a plot of much intricacy, or even of  great interest. The point and brilliancy of the dialogue, and the  perfection of the actors, render that a matter of subordinate  consequence. _The Two Eagles_, by Bayard and Bieville (these  partnerships are frequent among the dramatists of Paris), was brought  out at the _Theatre Montansier_. Hippolyte Vidoux, clerk in a cap store  and lieutenant in the National Guards, is a charming fellow, and the  idol of the women in the whole quarter. He sings, jokes, and dances the  polka in every style. He is introduced into the salons of his superior  officer, Count Chamaral, but meets with no sort of success among the  marchionesses and duchesses. On the other hand, these ladies are dying  for the young Baron Albert, who dances the contra-dance with a mien of  languishing resignation worthy of a funeral. The Baron falls in love  with the daughter of a rich baker, but in vain. Here Hippolyte carries  off the honors and the heiress according to the French proverb, _the  eagle of one house is a turkey in another_. At the _Opera Comique_, a  piece in one act, _The Peasant_, by Alboize, music by Poisat is one of  the latest novelties. A proud and obstinate German Baron refuses his  daughter's hand to her lover, whose great merit nevertheless causes him  to be ennobled. Still the Baron refuses his daughter. \"What!\" he says,  \"shall I marry my child to a new-baked nobleman?\" But as good luck would  have it, the Emperor Joseph happens along in disguise, on one of his  excursions for relieving virtue and unmasking vice. The Baron receives  him, but has nothing to set before him. Hereupon a gardener furnishes a  deer, which saves the honor of the house. The Emperor is delighted with  the venison, and makes the donor sit down at the table. He is the father  of the suitor, and as he has thus had the honor to eat with the Emperor,  the Baron can say nothing more against the marriage. The good Emperor  blesses the happy pair, and sets off again to see if there are no more  comic operas in his dominions to which he can contribute a happy  denouement. At the _Theatre des Varietes_ has been produced the _Ring of  Solomon_, in one act, by Henry Berthoud. The scene is laid in Holland,  in the winter, which affords an excellent opportunity to the  scene-painter and property-man. Threa, a poor and silly girl, is so  passionately in love with Hans, who has saved her from death, that she  climbs a wall to see him as he is going by. The wall tumbles down with  her, and among the fragments she finds the ring of Solomon, and puts it  on. At once she is surrounded by fairies, in the well-known ballet  costume, who carry her off into a Dutch paradise, where she also becomes  a fairy, and undergoes a remarkable improvement in her wits. But this  does not bring any change in her passion for Hans, and she prefers to be  unhappy with him to floating for ever through the aerial joys of  fairydom without him. Accordingly, she renounces the privilege conferred  on her by the ring, and is rewarded for so much virtue by passing  through a new transformation, after which she appears as a most lovely  peasantess, and marries Hans to the universal satisfaction.           *       *       *       *       *    GERMAN NOVELS.--The bookstores of Germany now swarm with new novels,  some of which we have already noticed. _Modern Titans: Little People in  a Great Epoch_, from the press of Bookhaus, seems to be written with the  express purpose of introducing all the notabilities of Berlin, Breslau  and Vienna, and is not successful. The name of the author is not given.  _Der Tannhausen_ treats of suicide, republicanism, the identity of God  and the universe, faith, skepticism, Christ, marriage, the emancipation  of woman, and whatsoever new-fangled and startling ideas and phrases the  author has met with in the activity of this busy age. This book is also  charged with outrageous personalities. _George Volker_, a Romance of the  year 1848, by Otto Mueller, 3 vols., is of course, a revolutionary story.  The hero is so unfortunate as to be in love with two women at a time,  the one a country, and the other a peasant girl. He engages in the  Badian insurrection, is about to be arrested, and thereupon gets out of  all his difficulties by shooting himself. _Der Sohn des Volkes_, by  Leoni Schucking, takes its subject and plot from the French Revolution  and its influence on Germany. It is written with talent, and is  altogether in the interest of the aristocracy. _Der Bettler von James's  Park_ (the Beggar of James's Park), by Alexander Jung, is not  revolutionary but tragic and sentimental. At the same time, it is  didactic, and sets forth sundry ideas with reference to love, God, and  liberty. But the story deserves more than a line in these columns, were  it only as a literary curiosity. The hero is haunted by the notion that  a great misfortune will fall upon his family, whenever a travelling  dealer shall offer an _ecce homo_ for sale to any one of its members.  Unluckily, such a picture is offered to himself, and he almost loses his  wits at it. Hereupon he goes to see the young lady with whom he is in  love, and finds her dying. This quite upsets him, and he goes crazy,  and, in this condition, becomes a beggar in the London streets. At the  beginning, he is very lean, and is so well suited to this trade, that he  is even made a member of the beggars' guild. But ill luck still pursues  him; he becomes excessively fat, and gains a belly of most aldermanic  proportions. Here a lord takes him up as an object at once of study and  philanthropy, but not with sufficient interest in him to provide for his  support. Alms he gets none; next, he is turned out of the guild, and, at  last, is taken to a hospital, where he loses his flesh, and regains his  reason. Finally, after passing through a variety of other strange  experiences, he dies in tranquillity, wept by the same lord, and by the  lady he had himself supposed to be dead; but who, instead of this, had  become a nun in France. _Schnock_, a picture of life in the Netherlands,  is by Frederich Hebbel, a man of some distinction, as a dramatic writer,  as we have noticed elsewhere. The general idea of this book is borrowed  from Jean Paul's _Journey of the Chaplain Schmelzle_. The hero is a man  of weak and timid character, married to a woman of unsparing energy and  resolution. The style and execution of the work are clumsy, exaggerated  and abominable. _Handel und Wandel_ (Doings and Viewings), by  Hacklaender, is worthy of all praise, as a faithful and vivid picture of  German rural and domestic life. The characters are all human, the action  simple and direct, and the tone healthy and agreeable. Hacklaender is an  exception to the mass of modern German novelists, of whom, taking them  together, as may be judged from the brief remarks above, no great good  can be said.    _Ein Dunkles Loss_ (A Dark Destiny), by L. Bechstein, is a socialist  book, which, in the form of a novel, discusses questions relating to  art, not without genuine insight and original power of thought.           *       *       *       *       *    THE COUNTESS HAHN-HAHN, the bravest and decidedly the cleverest of the  women who have written books of Oriental travel, and whose  \"latitudinarian\" novels constitute a remarkable portion of the recent  romantic literature of Germany, we perceive has entered a convent. The  _Ladies' Companion_ exclaims hereof:--         \"When will the wild and the restless learn self-distrust       from the histories of kindred spirits? And, observing how       the pendulum must vibrate (as in Madame Hahn-Hahn's case)       from utter disdain of social laws, to the most superstitious       form of association under authority--how, almost always, to       defiance must succeed a desire for reconciliation. When will       they become chary of pouring out their laments, their       attacks, their complaints, seeing that similar protestations       are almost certainly followed by after repentance and       recantation!\"    The Countess Hahn-Hahn unfortunately has but one eye, and she is  otherwise astonishingly ugly. So we may account for a very large  proportion of the eccentricities of the sex. Had she been in"]]]
