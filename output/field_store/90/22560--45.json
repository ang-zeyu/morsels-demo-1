And the head chief gave his daughter to the young  man.    \"Let all the men and chiefs assemble. Let all the stout-hearted young  men assemble. They can look at my daughter's husband,\" he said.    They assembled. They came to see the young man and brought the things  they intended giving him.    \"He says that he who went to get the man who was killed by falling has  come back. The chief says that as he has made the young man his  daughter's husband you shall go to see the young man. He says that you  will take to him what things you wish to give him. The chief says he  will give thanks for them.\" So shouted the crier.    All the young men and those who were brave and generous went thither.  They all gave him clothing and good horses. His wife's father made him  the head chief.    \"Make ye a tent for him in the center,\" said the old chief.    They set up a tent for him in the center. They finished it.    \"The people did not eat. As they sat waiting for you to appear, the  nation did not eat. You came back when they were just removing camp,\"  said the old chief.    \"Ho!\" said the one who had just reached home. \"Let two old men go as  criers.\"    So the criers shouted: \"The chiefs daughter's husband says that you  will rest tomorrow. He says you will not go in any direction  whatever.\"    The next day he commanded those who had come back on horseback to act  as scouts. And the scouts came back very soon; because by means of the  iron rod which he had asked of his father, he made a great many  buffaloes very quickly. He spoke of surrounding them. They shot down  many of the buffaloes. He went to take part in surrounding them.    His wife said, \"I desire to go to see them surround the herd. I must  go to see the buffaloes. When they are killed, I will be quite likely  to come back.\"    When they killed the buffaloes she was coming back; the wife stood on  the hill. Her husband came to that place.    \"Though I killed the buffaloes, they will cut them up,\" he said. They  who surrounded them reached home.    Again they spoke of a buffalo hunt. \"The chief's daughter's husband  speaks indeed of sending them to act as scouts,\" said the criers.    Again the herd of buffaloes had come to that country. They surrounded  them. Again they shot down many of them.    At last the son of the old head chief was in a bad humor. He was in a  bad humor because his sister's husband had been made chief.    Now at night, the horse used to say to the young man, \"O father, a man  desires very much to kill us. It is so every night.\" And after that at  night the young man used to take care of his horse and mule.    On the next day they surrounded the herd in the land where the deed  was done. It was just so again; a great many buffaloes had been  coming. At length the son wished the buffaloes to trample his sister's  husband to death. When they attacked the buffaloes, he waved his robe.  Turning around in his course, he waved his robe again. When the  sister's husband went right in among the buffaloes, they closed in on  him and he was not seen at all.    The people said, \"The buffaloes have trampled to death the chief's  daughter's husband.\"    When the buffaloes trampled him to death, they scattered and went  homeward in every direction, moving in long lines. And the people did  not find any trace whatever of what was done. They did not find the  horse. Even the man they did not find. When the buffaloes killed him  by trampling, the horse had gone back to Him Who Made Things.          THE BUFFALO AND THE GRIZZLY BEAR    _Omaha_      Grizzly Bear was going somewhere, following the course of a stream,  and at last he went straight towards the headland. When he got in  sight, Buffalo Bull was standing beneath it. Grizzly Bear retraced his  steps, going again to the stream, following its course until he got  beyond the headland. Then he drew near and peeped. He saw that Buffalo  Bull was very lean, and standing with his head bowed, as if sluggish.  So Grizzly Bear crawled up close to him, made a rush, seized him by  the hair of his head, and pulled down his head. He turned Buffalo Bull  round and round, shaking him now and then, saying, \"Speak! Speak! I  have been coming to this place a long time, and they say you have  threatened to fight me. Speak!\" Then he hit Buffalo Bull on the nose  with his open paw.    \"Why!\" said Buffalo Bull, \"I have never threatened to fight you, who  have been coming to this country so long.\"    \"Not so! You have threatened to fight me.\" Letting go the buffalo's  head, Grizzly Bear went around and seized him by the tail, turning him  round and round. Then he left, but as he did so, he gave him a hard  blow with his open paw.    \"Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! you have caused me great pain,\" said Buffalo  Bull. Bobtailed Grizzly Bear departed.    Buffalo Bull thought thus: \"Attack him! You too have been just that  sort of a person.\"    Grizzly Bear knew what he was thinking, so he said, \"Why! what are you  saying?\"    \"I said nothing,\" said Buffalo Bull.    Then Grizzly Bear came back. He seized Buffalo Bull by the tail,  pulling him round and round. Then he seized him by the horns, pulling  his head round and round. Then he seized him again by the tail and hit  him again with the open paw. Again Grizzly Bear departed. And again  Buffalo Bull thought as he had done before. Then Grizzly Bear came  back and treated Buffalo Bull as he had before.    Buffalo Bull stepped backward, throwing his tail into the air.    \"Why! Do not flee,\" said Grizzly Bear.    Buffalo threw himself down, and rolled over and over. Then he  continued backing, pawing the ground.    \"Why! I say, do not flee,\" said Grizzly Bear. When Buffalo Bull  backed, making ready to attack him, Grizzly Bear thought he was  scared.    Then Buffalo Bull ran towards Grizzly, puffing a great deal. When he  neared him, he rushed on him. He sent Grizzly Bear flying through the  air.    As Grizzly Bear came down towards the earth, Buffalo Bull caught him  on his horns and threw him into the air again. When Grizzly Bear fell  and lay on the ground, Buffalo Bull made at him with his horns to gore  him, but just missed him. Grizzly Bear crawled away slowly, with  Buffalo Bull following him step by step, thrusting at him now and  then, though without striking him. When Grizzly Bear came to a cliff,  he plunged over headlong, and landed in a thicket at the foot. Buffalo  Bull had run so fast he could not stop at the edge where Grizzly Bear  went over, but followed the cliff for some distance. Then he came back  and stood with his tail partly raised. Grizzly Bear returned to the  bank and peeped.    \"Oh, Buffalo Bull,\" said Grizzly Bear. \"Let us be friends. We are very  much alike in disposition.\"          [Notes: RIVALRY OVER THE BUFFALO    (Comanche drawing on a buffalo shoulder blade)    _The Indian chase is by arrow; the white man's by the lasso, gun, and  spear. The rivalry is indicated by half the buffalo being drawn as  belonging to one race, half to the other. The white men are supposed  to be Spaniards. The shoulder blade was found in the Comanche country,  in Texas._]    [Illustration: _Enlarged from a sketch in Report of the Bureau of  Ethnology_]      [Notes: CAPTURE OF A WANDERING BUFFALO    (Indian drawing)    _A buffalo has wandered near an Indian village, and is being captured.

When I was there the first  time, I was small; therefore, I did not shoot the buffaloes. But I  used to take care of the pack horses for those who surrounded the  herd. When they surrounded the herd at the very first, I spoke of  shooting at the buffaloes. But my father said, \"Perhaps the horse  might throw you suddenly, and then the buffalo might gore you.\" And I  was in a bad humor.    My father went with me to the hill. We sat and looked on them when  they attacked the buffaloes. And notwithstanding my father talked to  me, I continued there without talking to him. At length one man was  coming directly toward the tents in pursuit of a buffalo bull. And the  buffalo bull was savage. He attacked the man now and then.    \"Come! Go thither,\" said my father. I tied a lariat on a large red  mare that was very tall. And taking a very light gun which my father  had, I went over there. When I arrived the buffalo bull was standing  motionless. The man said he was very glad that I had come. The buffalo  bull was savage. The man shot suddenly at him with a bow and wounded  him on the back. And then he attacked us. The horse on which I was  seated leaped very far four times, and had gone off, throwing me  suddenly. When the buffalo bull had come very close, he wheeled around  and departed. So I failed to shoot at him before he went. I reached  home just as my mother was scolding my father about me. When the horse  reached home with the bridle sticking to it, she knew that I had been  thrown. My father said nothing at all, but sat laughing. Addressing  me, he said, \"Did you kill the buffalo bull?\" And I did not speak.

Words by Whittier. \"Beatitude,\" by T. Hastings.      [Music]    Our fellow countrymen in chains,    Slaves in a land of light and law!  Slaves crouching on the very plains    Where rolled the storm of Freedom's war!  A groan from Eutaw's haunted wood--    A wail where Camden's martyrs fell--  By every shrine of patriot blood,    From Moultrie's wall and Jasper's well.    By storied hill and hallow'd grot,    By mossy wood and marshy glen,  Whence rang of old the rifle-shot,    And hurrying shout of Marion's men!  The groan of breaking hearts is there--    The falling lash--the fetter's clank!  Slaves--SLAVES are breathing in that air,    Which old De Kalb and Sumter drank!    What, ho!--our countrymen in chains!    The whip on WOMAN'S shrinking flesh!  Our soil yet reddening with the stains,    Caught from her scourging, warm and fresh!  What! mothers from their children riven!    What! God's own image bought and sold!  AMERICANS to market driven,    And barter'd as the brute for gold!    Speak! shall their agony of prayer    Come thrilling to our hearts in vain?  To us, whose fathers scorn'd to bear    The paltry menace of a chain;  To us, whose boast is loud and long    Of holy Liberty and Light--  Say, shall these writhing slaves of wrong,    Plead vainly for their plunder'd Right?    Shall every flap of England's flag    Proclaim that all around are free,  From \"farthest Ind\" to each blue crag    That beetles o'er the Western Sea?  And shall we scoff at Europe's kings,    When Freedom's fire is dim with us,  And round our country's altar clings    The damning shade of Slavery's curse?    Just God! and shall we calmly rest,    The Christian's scorn--the Heathen's mirth--  Content to live the lingering jest    And by-word of a mocking Earth?  Shall our own glorious land retain    That curse which Europe scorns to bear?  Shall our own brethren drag the chain    Which not even Russia's menials wear?    Down let the shrine of Moloch sink,    And leave no traces where it stood;  No longer let its idol drink    His daily cup of human blood:  But rear another altar there,    To Truth, and Love, and Mercy given,  And Freedom's gift, and Freedom's prayer,    Shall call an answer down from Heaven!          Myron Holley.    BY W.H. BURLEIGH.      Yes--fame is his:--but not the fame    For which the conqueror pants and strives,  Whose path is tracked through blood and flame,    And over countless human lives!  His name no armed battalions hail    With bugle shriek or thundering gun,--  No widows curse him, as they wail    For slaughtered husband and for son.    Amid the moral strife alone,    He battled fearlessly and long,  And poured, with clear, untrembling tone,    Rebuke upon the hosts of Wrong--  To break Oppression's cruel rod,    He dared the perils of the fight,  And in the name of FREEDOM'S GOD    Struck boldly for the TRUE and RIGHT!    With faith, whose eye was never dim,    The triumph, yet afar, he saw,  When, bonds smote off from soul and limb,    And freed alike by Love and Law,  The slave--no more a slave--shall stand    Erect--and loud, from sea to sea,  Exultant burst o'er all the land    The glorious song of jubilee!    Why should we mourn, thy labor done,    That thou art called to thy reward;  Rest, Freedom's war-worn champion!    Rest, faithful soldier of the LORD!  For oh, not vainly hast thou striven,    Through storm, and gloom, and deepest night--  Not vainly hath thy life been given    For GOD, for FREEDOM, and for RIGHT.          VOICE OF NEW ENGLAND AGAINST SLAVERY.    Words by Whittier. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    Up the hill side, down the glen,  Rouse the sleeping citizen;  Summon out the might of men!  Like a lion growling low,  Like a nightstorm rising slow,  Like the tread of unseen foe.    It is coming--it is nigh!  Stand your homes and altars by;  On your own free threshholds die.  Clang the bells in all your spires;  On the gray hills of your sires  Fling to heaven your signal fires.    Whoso shrinks or falters now,  Whoso to the yoke would bow,  Brand the craven on his brow.  Freedom's soil hath only place  For a free and fearless race--  None for traitors false and base.    Take your land of sun and bloom;  Only leave to Freedom room  For her plough, and forge, and loom.  Take your slavery-blackened vales;  Leave us but our own free gales,  Blowing on our thousand sails.    Onward with your fell design;  Dig the gulf and draw the line;  Fire beneath your feet the mine:  Deeply, when the wide abyss  Yawns between your land and this,  Shall ye feel your helplessness.    By the hearth, and in the bed,  Shaken by a look or tread,  Ye shall own a guilty dread.  And the curse of unpaid toil,  Downward through your generous soil,  Like a fire shall burn and spoil.    Our bleak hills shall bud and blow,  Vines our rocks shall overgrow,  Plenty in our valleys flow;--  And when vengeance clouds your skies,  Hither shall ye turn your eyes,  As the damned on Paradise!    We but ask our rocky strand,  Freedom's true and brother band,  Freedom's strong and honest hand,  Valleys by the slave untrod,  And the Pilgrim's mountain sod,  Blessed of our fathers' God!          THE CLARION OF FREEDOM.    Words from the Emancipator. Music \"The Chariot.\"      [Music]    The clarion--the clarion of Freedom now sounds,  From the east to the west Independence resounds;  From the hills, and the streams, and the far distant skies,  Let the shout Independence from Slav'ry arise.    The army--the army have taken the field,  And the Liberty hosts never, never will yield;  By free principles strengthened, each bosom now glows,  And with ardor immortal the struggle they close.    The armor, the armor that girds every breast,  Is the hope of deliverance for millions oppressed;  O'er the tears, and the sighs, and the wrongs of the slave,  See the white flag of freedom triumphantly wave.    The conflict--the conflict will shortly be o'er,  And the demon of slavery shall rule us no more;  And the laurels of victory shall surely reward  The heroes immortal who've conquered for God.

Sons of Pilgrim Fathers blest,  Pilgrim Mothers gone to rest,  Listen to their high behest,      Strike for Liberty.    Ministers of God to men,  Heed ye not the nation's sin?  Heaven's blessing can ye win      If ye falter now?  Men of blood now ask your vote,  O'er your heads their banners float;  Raise, Oh raise the warning note,      God and duty call!

While beneath a despot's power      Groans the suffering slave?    While on every southern gale,  Comes the helpless captive's tale,  And the voice of woman's wail,      And of man's despair?  While our homes and rights are dear,  Guarded still with watchful fear,  Shall we coldly turn our ear      From the suppliant's prayer?
