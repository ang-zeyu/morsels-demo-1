With the  progress of discovery the city of Norumbega was found as baseless as  the fables of the golden city on the banks of the Orinoco, and of the  fountain of youth among the forests and everglades of Florida.          {29}    III.    A BRETON SAILOR DISCOVERS CANADA AND ITS GREAT RIVER.    (1534-36.)    In the fourth decade of the sixteenth century we find ourselves in the  domain of precise history.  The narratives of the voyages of Jacques  Cartier of St. Malo, that famous port of Brittany which has given so  many sailors to the world, are on the whole sufficiently definite, even  at this distance of three centuries and a half, to enable us to follow  his routes, and recognise the greater number of the places in the gulf  and river which he revealed to the old world.  The same enterprising  king who had sent Verrazano to the west in 1524, commissioned the  Breton sailor to find a short passage to Cathay and give a new dominion  to France.    At the time of the departure of Cartier in 1534 for the \"new-found  isle\" of Cabot, the world had made considerable advances in  geographical knowledge.  South America was now ascertained to be a  separate continent, and the great Portuguese Magellan had {30} passed  through the straits, which ever since have borne his name, and found  his way across the Pacific to the spice islands of Asia.  As respects  North America beyond the Gulf of Mexico and the country to the North,  dense ignorance still prevailed, and though a coast line had been  followed from Florida to Cape Breton by Cabot, Gomez, and Verrazano, it  was believed either to belong to a part of Asia or to be a mere  prolongation of Greenland.  If one belief prevailed more than another  it was in the existence of a great sea, called on the maps \"the sea of  Verrazano,\" in what is now the upper basin of the Mississippi and the  Great Lakes of the west, and which was only separated from the Atlantic  by a narrow strip of land.  Now that it was clear that no short passage  to India and China could be found through the Gulf of Mexico, and that  South America was a continental region, the attention of hopeful  geographers and of enterprising sailors and adventurers was directed to  the north, especially as Spain was relatively indifferent to enterprise  in that region.  No doubt the French King thought that Cartier would  find his way to the sea of Verrazano, beyond which were probably the  lands visited by Marco Polo, that enterprising merchant of Venice,  whose stories of adventure in India and China read like stories of the  Arabian Nights.    [Illustration: Jacques Cartier]    Jacques Cartier made three voyages to the continent of America between  1534 and 1542, and probably another in 1543.  The first voyage, which  took place in 1534 and lasted from April until September, was confined  to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which he {32} explored with some  thoroughness after passing through the strait of Belle Isle, then  called the Gulf of Castles (Chasteaux).  The coast of Labrador he  described with perfect accuracy as extremely forbidding, covered with  rocks and moss and \"as very likely the land given by God to Cain.\"  In  one of the harbours of the Labrador coast he found a fishing vessel  from La Rochelle, the famous Protestant town of France, on its way to  the port of Brest, then and for some time after a place of call for the  fishermen who were already thronging the Gulf, where walrus, whales,  and cod were so abundant.  A good deal of time has been expended by  historical writers on the itinerary of this voyage, the record of which  is somewhat puzzling at times when we come to fix Cartier's names of  places on a modern map.  Confining ourselves to those localities of  which there is no doubt, we know he visited and named the isle of Brion  in honour of Admiral Philip de Chabot, Seigneur de Brion, who was a  friend and companion of Francis, and had received from him authority to  send out Cartier's expedition.  The Breton saw the great sand-dunes,  and red cliffs of the Magdalens rising from the sea like so many cones.  It was one of these islands he probably called Alezay, though there are  writers who recognise in his description a headland of Prince Edward  Island, but it is not certain that he visited or named any of the bays  or lagoons of that island which lies so snugly ensconced in the Gulf.  We recognise the bay of Miramichi (St. Lunaire) and the still more  beautiful scenery of the much larger bay of Chaleur (Heat) which he so  {33} named because he entered it on a very hot July day.  There he had  pleasant interviews with the natives, who danced and gave other  demonstrations of joy when they received some presents in exchange for  the food they brought to the strangers.  These people were probably  either Micmacs or Etchemins, one of the branches of the Algonquin  nation who inhabited a large portion of the Northern continent.  Cartier was enchanted with the natural beauties of \"as fine a country  as one would wish to see and live in, level and smooth, warmer than  Spain, where there is abundance of wheat, which has an ear like that of  rye, and again like oats, peas growing as thickly and as large as if  they had been cultivated, red and white barberries, strawberries, red  and white roses, and other flowers of a delightful and sweet perfume,  meadows of rich grasses, and rivers full of salmon\"--a perfectly true  description of the beautiful country watered by the Restigouche and  Metapedia rivers.  Cartier also visited the picturesque bay of Gaspe,  where the scenery is grand but the trees smaller and the land less  fertile than in the neighbourhood of Chaleur and its rivers.  On a  point at the entrance of the harbour of Gaspe--an Indian name having  probably reference to a split rock, which has long been a curiosity of  the coast--Cartier raised a cross, thirty feet in height, on the middle  of which there was a shield or escutcheon with three fleurs-de-lis, and  the inscription, _Vive le Roy de France_.  Cartier then returned to  France by way of the strait of Belle Isle, without having seen the  great river to whose mouth he had been so close {34} when he stood on  the hills of Gaspe or passed around the shores of desolate Anticosti.    Cartier brought back with him two sons of the Indian chief of a tribe  he saw at Gaspe, who seem to have belonged to the Huron-Iroquois nation  he met at Stadacona, now Quebec, when he made the second voyage which I  have to describe.  The accounts he gave of the country on the Gulf  appear to have been sufficiently encouraging to keep up the interest of  the King and the Admiral of France in the scheme of discovery which  they had planned.  In this second voyage of 1535-36, the most memorable  of all he made to American waters, he had the assistance of a little  fleet of three vessels, the _Grande Hermine_, the _Petite Hermine_, and  the _Emerillon_, of which the first had a burden of one hundred and  twenty tons--quite a large ship compared with the two little vessels of  sixty tons each that were given him for his first venture.  This fleet,  which gave Canada to France for two centuries and a quarter, reached  Newfoundland during the early part of July, passed through the strait  of Belle Isle, and on the 10th of August, came to a little bay or  harbour on the northern shore of the present province of Quebec, but  then known as Labrador, to which he gave the name of St. Laurent, in  honour of the saint whose festival happened to fall on the day of his  arrival.  This bay is now generally believed to be the port of Sainte  Genevieve, and the name which Cartier gave it was gradually transferred  in the course of a century to the whole gulf as well as to the river  itself which the Breton sailor was the first to place {35} definitely  on the maps of those days of scanty geographical knowledge.  Cartier  led his vessels through the passage between the northern shores of  Canada and the island of Anticosti, which he called Assomption,  although it has long since resumed its old name, which has been  gradually changed from the original Natiscotic to Naticousti, and  finally to Anticosti.  When the adventurers came near the neighbourhood  of Trinity River on the north side of the Gulf, the two Gaspe Indians  who were on board Cartier's vessel, the Grande Hermine, told them that  they were now at the entrance of the kingdom of Saguenay where red  copper was to be found, and that away beyond flowed the great river of  Hochelaga and Canada.  This Saguenay kingdom extended on the north side  of the river as far as the neighbourhood of the present well-known Isle  aux Coudres; then came the kingdom of Canada, stretching as far as the  island of Montreal, where the King of Hochelaga exercised dominion over  a number of tribes in the adjacent country.    Cartier passed the gloomy portals of the Saguenay, and stopped for a  day or two at Isle aux Coudres (Coudrieres) over fifty miles below  Quebec, where mass was celebrated for the first time on the river of  Canada, and which he named on account of the hazel-nuts he found \"as  large and better tasting than those of France, though a little harder.\"  Cartier then followed the north shore, with its lofty, well-wooded  mountains stretching away to the northward, and came at last to an  anchorage not far from Stadacona, somewhere between the present Isle of  {36} Orleans and the mainland.  Here he had an interview with the  natives, who showed every confidence in the strangers when they found  that the two Gaspe Indians, Taignoagny and Domagaya, were their  companions.  As soon as they were satisfied of this fact--and here we  have a proof that these two Indians must have belonged to the same  nation--\"they showed their joy, danced, and performed various antics.\"  Subsequently the lord of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22566"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#7)"],[1,"only in a fairy country could Eureka  and Jim talk as we do.\"    \"That's true,\" said Zeb, thoughtfully.    In the vegetable gardens they found the strawberries and melons, and  several other unknown but delicious fruits, of which they ate heartily.  But the kitten bothered them constantly by demanding milk or meat, and  called the Wizard names because he could not bring her a dish of milk by  means of his magical arts.    As they sat upon the grass watching Jim, who was still busily eating,  Eureka said:    \"I don't believe you are a Wizard at all!\"    \"No,\" answered the little man, \"you are quite right. In the strict sense  of the word I am not a Wizard, but only a humbug.\"    \"The Wizard of Oz has always been a humbug,\" agreed Dorothy. \"I've known  him for a long time.\"    \"If that is so,\" said the boy, \"how could he do that wonderful trick  with the nine tiny piglets?\"    \"Don't know,\" said Dorothy, \"but it must have been humbug.\"    \"Very true,\" declared the Wizard, nodding at her. \"It was necessary to  deceive that ugly Sorcerer and the Prince, as well as their stupid  people; but I don't mind telling you, who are my friends, that the thing  was only a trick.\"    \"But I saw the little pigs with my own eyes!\" exclaimed Zeb.    \"So did I,\" purred the kitten.    \"To be sure,\" answered the Wizard. \"You saw them because they were  there. They are in my inside pocket now. But the pulling of them apart  and pushing them together again was only a sleight-of-hand trick.\"    \"Let's see the pigs,\" said Eureka, eagerly.    The little man felt carefully in his pocket and pulled out the tiny  piglets, setting them upon the grass one by one, where they ran around  and nibbled the tender blades.    \"They're hungry, too,\" he said.    \"Oh, what cunning things!\" cried Dorothy, catching up one and petting  it.    \"Be careful!\" said the piglet, with a squeal, \"you're squeezing me!\"    \"Dear me!\" murmured the Wizard, looking at his pets in astonishment.  \"They can actually talk!\"    \"May I eat one of them?\" asked the kitten, in a pleading voice. \"I'm  awfully hungry.\"    \"Why, Eureka,\" said Dorothy, reproachfully, \"what a cruel question! It  would be dreadful to eat these dear little things.\"    \"I should say so!\" grunted another of the piglets, looking uneasily at  the kitten; \"cats are cruel things.\"    \"I'm not cruel,\" replied the kitten, yawning. \"I'm just hungry.\"    \"You cannot eat my piglets, even if you are starving,\" declared the  little man, in a stern voice. \"They are the only things I have to prove  I'm a wizard.\"    \"How did they happen to be so little?\" asked Dorothy. \"I never saw such  small pigs before.\"    \"They are from the Island of Teenty-Weent,\" said the Wizard, \"where  everything is small because it's a small island. A sailor brought them  to Los Angeles and I gave him nine tickets to the circus for them.\"    \"But what am I going to eat?\" wailed the kitten, sitting in front of  Dorothy and looking pleadingly into her face. \"There are no cows here  to give milk; or any mice, or even grasshoppers. And if I can't eat the  piglets you may as well plant me at once and raise catsup.\"    \"I have an idea,\" said the Wizard, \"that there are fishes in these  brooks. Do you like fish?\"    \"Fish!\" cried the kitten. \"Do I like fish? Why, they're better than  piglets--or even milk!\"    \"Then I'll try to catch you some,\" said he.    \"But won't they be veg'table, like everything else here?\" asked the  kitten.    \"I think not. Fishes are not animals, and they are as cold and moist as  the vegetables themselves. There is no reason, that I can see, why they  may not exist in the waters of this strange country.\"    Then the Wizard bent a pin for a hook and took a long piece of string  from his pocket for a fish-line. The only bait he could find was a  bright red blossom from a flower; but he knew fishes are easy to fool if  anything bright attracts their attention, so he decided to try the  blossom. Having thrown the end of his line in the water of a nearby  brook he soon felt a sharp tug that told him a fish had bitten and was  caught on the bent pin; so the little man drew in the string and, sure  enough, the fish came with it and was landed safely on the shore,  where it began to flop around in great excitement.    [Illustration: IN THE GARDEN OF THE MANGABOOS.]    The fish was fat and round, and its scales glistened like beautifully  cut jewels set close together; but there was no time to examine it  closely, for Eureka made a jump and caught it between her claws, and in  a few moments it had entirely disappeared.    \"Oh, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy, \"did you eat the bones?\"    \"If it had any bones, I ate them,\" replied the kitten, composedly, as it  washed its face after the meal. \"But I don't think that fish had any  bones, because I didn't feel them scratch my throat.\"    \"You were very greedy,\" said the girl.    \"I was very hungry,\" replied the kitten.    The little pigs had stood huddled in a group, watching this scene with  frightened eyes.    \"Cats are dreadful creatures!\" said one of them.    \"I'm glad we are not fishes!\" said another.    \"Don't worry,\" Dorothy murmured, soothingly, \"I'll not let the kitten  hurt you.\"    Then she happened to remember that in a corner of her suit-case were one  or two crackers that were left over from her luncheon on the train, and  she went to the buggy and brought them. Eureka stuck up her nose at such  food, but the tiny piglets squealed delightedly at the sight of the  crackers and ate them up in a jiffy.    \"Now let us go back to the city,\" suggested the Wizard. \"That is, if Jim  has had enough of the pink grass.\"    The cab-horse, who was browsing near, lifted his head with a sigh.    \"I've tried to eat a lot while I had the chance,\" said he, \"for it's  likely to be a long while between meals in this strange country. But I'm  ready to go, now, at any time you wish.\"    So, after the Wizard had put the piglets back into his inside pocket,  where they cuddled up and went to sleep, the three climbed into the  buggy and Jim started back to the town.    \"Where shall we stay?\" asked the girl.    \"I think I shall take possession of the House of the Sorcerer,\" replied  the Wizard; \"for the Prince said in the presence of his people that he  would keep me until they picked another Sorcerer, and the new Princess  won't know but that we belong there.\"    They agreed to this plan, and when they reached the great square Jim  drew the buggy into the big door of the domed hall.    \"It doesn't look very homelike,\" said Dorothy, gazing around at the  bare room. \"But it's a place to stay, anyhow.\"    \"What are those holes up there?\" enquired the boy, pointing to some  openings that appeared near the top of the dome.    \"They look like doorways,\" said Dorothy; \"only there are no stairs to  get to them.\"    \"You forget that stairs are unnecessary,\" observed the Wizard. \"Let us  walk up, and see where the doors lead to.\"    With this he began walking in the air toward the high openings, and  Dorothy and Zeb followed him. It was the same sort of climb one  experiences when walking up a hill, and they were nearly out of breath  when they came to the row of openings, which they perceived to be  doorways leading into halls in the upper part of the house. Following  these halls they discovered many small rooms opening from them, and some  were furnished with glass benches, tables and chairs. But there were no  beds at all.    \"I wonder if these people never sleep,\" said the girl.    \"Why, there seems to be no night at all in this country,\" Zeb replied.  \"Those colored suns are exactly in the same place they were when we  came, and if there is no sunset there can be no night.\"    \"Very true,\" agreed the Wizard. \"But it is a long time since I have had  any sleep, and I'm tired. So I think I shall lie down upon one of these  hard glass benches and take a nap.\"    \"I will, too,\" said Dorothy, and chose a little room at the end of the  hall.    Zeb walked down again to unharness Jim, who, when he found himself free,  rolled over a few times and then settled down to sleep, with Eureka  nestling comfortably beside his big, boney body. Then the boy returned  to one of the upper rooms, and in spite of the hardness of the glass  bench was soon deep in slumberland.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER 6.    THE MANGABOOS PROVE DANGEROUS      When the Wizard awoke the six colored suns were shining down upon the  Land of the Mangaboos just as they had done ever since his arrival. The  little man, having had a good sleep, felt rested and refreshed, and  looking through the glass partition of the room he saw Zeb sitting up on  his bench and yawning. So the Wizard went in to him.    \"Zeb,\" said he, \"my balloon is of no further use in this strange  country, so I may as well leave it on the square where it fell. But in  the basket-car are some things I would like to keep with me. I wish you  would go and fetch my satchel, two lanterns, and a can of kerosene oil  that is under the seat. There is nothing else that I care about.\"    So the boy went willingly upon the errand, and by the time he had  returned Dorothy was awake. Then the three held a counsel to decide what  they should do next, but could think of no way to better their  condition.    \"I don't like these veg'table people,\" said the little girl. \"They're  cold and flabby, like cabbages, in spite of their prettiness.\"    \"I agree with you. It is because there is no warm blood in them,\"  remarked the Wizard.    \"And they have no hearts; so they can't love anyone--not even  themselves,\" declared the boy.    \"The Princess is lovely to look at,\" continued Dorothy, thoughtfully;  \"but I don't care much for her, after all. If there was any other place  to go, I'd like to go there.\"    \"But _is_ there any other place?\" asked the Wizard.    \"I don't know,\" she answered.    Just then they heard the big voice of Jim the cab-horse calling to them,  and going to the doorway"]]]
