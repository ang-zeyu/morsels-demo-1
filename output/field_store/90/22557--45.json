Widow  remarriage is permitted, and a widow is often expected to marry  the younger brother of her deceased husband. If a bachelor wishes  to marry a widow he first goes through the ceremony with a dagger  or an earthen vessel. Divorce is freely permitted. In Hoshangabad a  strip is torn off the clothes worn by husband and wife as a sign of  their divorce. This is presumably in contrast to the knotting of the  clothes of the couple together at a wedding.        10. Birth customs.      Among the Rawats of Chhattisgarh, when a child is shortly to be born  the midwife dips her hand in oil and presses it on the wall, and it  is supposed that she can tell by the way in which the oil trickles  down whether the child will be a boy or a girl. If a woman is weak  and ill during her pregnancy it is thought that a boy will be born,  but if she is strong and healthy, a girl. A woman in advanced pregnancy  is given whatever she desires to eat, and on one occasion especially  delicate kinds of food are served to her, this rite being known as  Sidhori. The explanation of the custom is that if the mother does  not get the food she desires during pregnancy the child will long for  it all through life. If delivery is delayed, a line of men and boys  is sometimes made from the door of the house to a well, and a vessel  is then passed from hand to hand from the house, filled with water,  and back again. Thus the water, having acquired the quality of speed  during its rapid transit, will communicate this to the woman and cause  her quick delivery. Or they take some of the clay left unmoulded on  the potter's wheel and give it her to drink in water; the explanation  of this is exactly similar, the earth having acquired the quality of  swiftness by the rapid transit on the wheel. If three boys or three  girls have been born to a woman, they think that the fourth should  be of the same sex, in order to make up two pairs. A boy or girl  born after three of the opposite sex is called Titra or Titri, and is  considered very unlucky. To avert this misfortune they cover the child  with a basket, kindle a fire of grass all round it, and smash a brass  pot on the floor. Then they say that the baby is the fifth and not  the fourth child, and the evil is thus removed. When one woman gives  birth to a male and another to a female child in the same quarter of  a village on the same day and they are attended by the same midwife,  it is thought that the boy child will fall ill from the contagion  of the girl child communicated through the midwife. To avoid this,  on the following Sunday the child's maternal uncle makes a banghy,  which is carried across the shoulders like a large pair of scales,  and weighs the child in it against cowdung. He then takes the banghy  and deposits it at cross-roads outside the village. The father cannot  see either the child or its mother till after the Chathi or sixth-day  ceremony of purification, when the mother is bathed and dressed in  clean clothes, the males of the family are shaved, all their clothes  are washed, and the house is whitewashed; the child is also named on  this day. The mother cannot go out of doors until after the Barhi or  twelfth-day ceremony. If a child is born at an unlucky astrological  period its ears are pierced in the fifth month after birth as a means  of protection.        11. Funeral rites. Bringing back the soul.      The dead are either buried or burnt. When a man is dying they put  basil leaves and boiled rice and milk in his mouth, and a little  piece of gold, or if they have not got gold they put a rupee in his  mouth and take it out again. For ten days after a death, food in  a leaf-cup and a lamp are set out in the house-yard every evening,  and every morning water and a tooth-stick. On the tenth day they are  taken away and consigned to a river. In Chhattisgarh on the third  day after death the soul is brought back. The women put a lamp on a  red earthen pot and go to a tank or stream at night. The fish are  attracted towards the light, and one of them is caught and put in  the pot, which is then filled with water. It is brought home and set  beside a small heap of flour, and the elders sit round it. The son  of the deceased or other near relative anoints himself with turmeric  and picks up a stone. This is washed with the water from the pot,  and placed on the floor, and a sacrifice of a cock or hen is made to  it according as the deceased was a man or a woman. The stone is then  enshrined in the house as a family god, and the sacrifice of a fowl  is repeated annually. It is supposed apparently that the dead man's  spirit is brought back to the house in the fish, and then transferred  to the stone by washing this with the water.        12. Religion. Krishna and other deified cowherds.      The Ahirs have a special relation to the Hindu religion, owing  to their association with the sacred cow, which is itself revered  as a goddess. When religion gets to the anthropomorphic stage the  cowherd, who partakes of the cow's sanctity, may be deified as its  representative. This was probably the case with Krishna, one of  the most popular gods of Hinduism, who was a cowherd, and, as he is  represented as being of a dark colour, may even have been held to  be of the indigenous races. Though, according to the legend, he was  really of royal birth, Krishna was brought up by Nand, a herdsman of  Gokul, and Jasoda or Dasoda his wife, and in the popular belief these  are his parents, as they probably were in the original story. The  substitution of Krishna, born as a prince, for Jasoda's daughter,  in order to protect him from destruction by the evil king Kansa of  Mathura, is perhaps a later gloss, devised when his herdsman parentage  was considered too obscure for the divine hero. Krishna's childhood in  Jasoda's house with his miraculous feats of strength and his amorous  sports with Radha and the other milkmaids of Brindawan, are among  the most favourite Hindu legends. Govind and Gopal, the protector  or guardian of cows, are names of Krishna and the commonest names of  Hindus, as are also his other epithets, Murlidhar and Bansidhar, the  flute-player; for Krishna and Balaram, like Greek and Roman shepherds,  were accustomed to divert themselves with song, to the accompaniment  of the same instrument. The child Krishna is also very popular, and  his birthday, the Janam-Ashtami on the 8th of dark Bhadon (August),  is a great festival. On this day potsful of curds are sprinkled over  the assembled worshippers. Krishna, however, is not the solitary  instance of the divine cowherd, but has several companions, humble  indeed compared to him, but perhaps owing their apotheosis to the  same reasons. Bhilat, a popular local godling of the Nerbudda Valley,  was the son of an Ahir or Gaoli woman; she was childless and prayed  to Parvati for a child, and the goddess caused her votary to have  one by her own husband, the god Mahadeo. Bhilat was stolen away from  his home by Mahadeo in the disguise of a beggar, and grew up to be  a great hero and made many conquests; but finally he returned and  lived with his herdsman parents, who were no doubt his real ones. He  performed numerous miracles, and his devotees are still possessed by  his spirit. Singaji is another godling who was a Gaoli by caste in  Indore. He became a disciple of a holy Gokulastha Gosain or ascetic,  and consequently a great observer of the Janam-Ashtami or Krishna's  birthday. [26] On one occasion Singaji was late for prayers on this  day, and the _guru_ was very angry, and said to him, 'Don't show your  face to me again until you are dead.' Singaji went home and told the  other children he was going to die. Then he went and buried himself  alive. The occurrence was noised abroad and came to the ears of the  _guru_, who was much distressed, and proceeded to offer his condolences  to Singaji's family. But on the way he saw Singaji, who had been  miraculously raised from the dead on account of his virtuous act of  obedience, grazing his buffaloes as before. After asking for milk,  which Singaji drew from a male buffalo calf, the _guru_ was able  to inform the bereaved parents of their son's joyful reappearance  and his miraculous powers; of these Singaji gave further subsequent  demonstration, and since his death, said to have occurred 350 years  ago, is widely venerated. The Gaolis pray to him for the protection  of their cattle from disease, and make thank-offerings of butter if  these prayers are fulfilled. Other pilgrims to Singaji's shrine offer  unripe mangoes and sugar, and an annual fair is held at it, when it is  said that for seven days no cows, flies or ants are to be seen in the  place. In the Betul district there is a village godling called Dait,  represented by a stone under a tree. He is the spirit of any Ahir who  in his lifetime was credited in the locality with having the powers of  an exorcist. In Mandla and other Districts when any buffalo herdsman  dies at a very advanced age the people make a platform for him within  the village and call it Mahashi Deo or the buffalo god. Similarly,  when an old cattle herdsman dies they do the same, and call it Balki  Deo or the bullock god. Here we have a clear instance of the process  of substituting the spirit of the herdsman for the cow or buffalo as  an object of worship. The occupation of the Ahir also lends itself to  religious imaginations. He stays in the forest or waste grass-land,  frequently alone from morning till night, watching his herds; and  the credulous and uneducated minds of the more emotional may easily  hear the voices of spirits, or in a half-sleeping condition during  the heat and stillness of the long day may think that visions have  appeared to them.
