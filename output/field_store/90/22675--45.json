But on the  second evening good taste prevailed, and since then the opera has been  a universal favorite.    Beaumarchais' tale was worked out anew by the Roman poet, Sterbini; in  our opera it runs as follows:    Count Almaviva is enamoured of Rosina, the ward of Doctor Bartolo.  She  is most jealously guarded by the old man, who wishes to make her his  own wife.  In vain the Count serenades her; she does not appear, and he  must needs invent some other means of obtaining his object.  Making the  acquaintance of the lighthearted and cunning barber Figaro, the latter  advises him to get entrance into Bartolo's house in the guise of a  soldier possessing a billet of quartering for his lodgings.  Rosina  herself has not failed to hear the sweet love-songs of the Count, known  to her only under the simple name of Lindoro; and with southern  passion, and the lightheartedness, which characterizes all the persons  who figure in this opera, but which is not to be mistaken for  frivolity, Rosina loves her nice lover {24} and is willing to be his  own.  Figaro has told her of Almaviva's love, and in return she gives  him a note, which she has written in secret.  But the old Doctor is a  sly fox, he has seen the inky little finger, and determines to keep his  eyes open.    When the Count appears in the guise of a half-drunken dragoon, the  Doctor sends Rosina away, and tries to put the soldier out of the  house, pretending to have a license against all billets.  The Count  resists, and while Bartolo seeks for his license, makes love to Rosina,  but after the Doctor's return there arises such an uproar, that all the  neighbors and finally the guards appear, who counsel the Count to  retire for once.    In the second act the Count gains entrance to Bartolo's house as a  singing-master who is deputed to give a lesson instead of the  feverstricken Basilio.  Of course the music-lesson is turned into a  love-lesson.    When all seems to be going well, the real Maestro, Basilio, enters and  all but frustrates their plans.  With gold and promises Figaro bribes  him to retreat, and the lovers agree to flee on the coming night.    Almost at the last moment the cunning of Bartolo hinders the projected  elopement, he shows a letter, which Rosina has written, and makes  Rosina believe that her lover, whom she only knows as Lindoro, in  concert with Figaro is betraying her to the Count.  Great is her joy,  when she detects, that Lindoro and Count Almaviva are one and the {25}  same person, and that he loves her as truly as ever.--They bribe the  old notary, who has been sent for by Bartolo to arrange his own  (Bartolo's) wedding with Rosina.  Bartolo signs the contract of  marriage, with Figaro as witness, and detects too late that he has been  duped, and that he has himself united the lovers.  At last he submits  with pretty good grace to the inevitable, and contents himself with  Rosina's dowry, which the Count generously transfers to him.          BENVENUTO CELLINI.    Opera in three acts by HECTOR BERLIOZ.    Text by de WAILLY and BARRIER, translated into German by PETER  CORNELIUS.      This opera by the spirited French musician has had a singular fate.  Composed more than forty years ago it never had the success it merited  in France; a \"succes d'estime\" was the only result.  Liszt, who was the  saviour of many a talented struggler was the first to recognize the  genius of the French composer.  He brought the opera out upon the stage  at Weimar, but without much success.  Berlioz was not understood by the  public.  Devrient in Carlsruhe tried a similar experiment and failed,  and so the opera was almost forgotten, until Germany, remembering the  duty owed to genius of whatever nationality it may be, placed it upon  the stage in Dresden, on the 4th of Nov. 1888 under the leadership of  one of the ablest of modern interpreters of music, Director  Schuch.--Its representation was {26} a triumph.  Though Berlioz can in  nowise be compared with Wagner, whose music is much more realistic and  sensuous Wagner may nevertheless be said to have opened a path for  Berlioz' style, which, though melodious differs widely from that of the  easy flowing Italian school, being more serious as well as more  difficult for the musical novice to understand.  This explains, why  Berlioz' compatriots esteemed, but never liked him; he was too  scientific.  To-day our ears and understanding are better prepared for  striking intervals and complicated orchestration, which latter is the  most brilliant feature in the opera.    Indeed the instrumentation is simply perfect, the choruses are  master-pieces of originality, life and melody, and the rythm with its  syncopes, is so remarkable, that one is more than justified in calling  the style unique; it is Berlioz and no other.    The text is far less good than the music, though the hero, whose life  Goethe found worthy of description in the 24th and 25th volume of his  works, might well interest.--The libretto is by no means strictly  historical, and suffers from improbabilities, which can only be excused  in an opera.    The tale is laid in Rome in the year 1532 under Pope Clement VII, and  comprises the events of three days, Monday before Shrove-tide,  Shrove-Tuesday and Ash-Wednesday.--Benvenuto Cellini, the Tuscan  goldsmith has been called to Rome by the Pope, in order to embellish  the city with his {27} masterpieces.  He loves Teresa, the daughter of  the old papal treasurer Balducci, and the love is mutual.--At the same  time another suitor, Fieramosca, the Pope's sculptor, is favored by her  father.  Old Balducci grumbles in the first scene at the Pope's  predilection for Cellini, declaring that such an excellent sculptor as  Fieramosca ought to suffice.  He goes for a walk and Cellini finds  Teresa alone.  To save her from Fieramosca he plans an elopement,  selecting the close of the Carnival as the time best suited for  carrying out their design.  The rendez-vous is to be the Piazza di  Colonna, where he will wait for her, disguised as a monk in white,  accompanied by a Capuchin, his pupil Ascanio.--Unhappily the rival  Fieramosca has entered unseen, and overheard all.  The ensuing terzetto  is a masterpiece.  While the lovers are bidding each-other farewell  Balducci returns; and Cellini has scarcely time to hide behind the  window-curtain before he enters.  The father is surprised to find his  daughter still up and Teresa, seeking for an excuse to send him away,  feigns to be frightened by a thief in her chamber.  There Balducci  finds the hapless Fieramosca hidden and Cellini meanwhile escapes.  Balducci and his daughter calling for help, all the female servants and  women of the neighborhood appear armed with brooms and wooden spoons.  They fall upon the hapless lover and finally force him to escape  through the window.    In the second act we find Cellini in a tavern with his pupils and  friends.  They have no money {28} left to pay for their wine, when  Ascanio brings gold from the Pope, which however he only delivers after  Cellini has given a solemn promise to finish at once the statue of  Perseus he is engaged upon.  Great is the general wrath, when they find  the money consist of but a paltry sum, and they resolve to avenge  themselves on the avaricious treasurer Balducci, by personating him in  the theatre.  Fieramosca, who has again been eaves-dropping turns for  help to his friend Pompeo, a bravo.--And they decide to outwit Cellini,  by adopting the same costumes as he and his pupil.    The scene changes; we see the Piazza di Colonna and the theatre, in  which the pantomime of King Midas is acted.  Balducci who is there with  his daughter among the spectators recognizes in the snoring King a  portrait of himself and furiously advances to grapple with him.  Cellini profits by the ensuing tumult to approach Teresa, but at the  same time Fieramosca comes up with Pompeo, and Teresa cannot discern  which is the true lover, owing to the masks.--A fight ensues, in which  Cellini stabs Pompeo.  He is arrested and Teresa flies with the  Capuchin Ascanio to Cellini's atelier.  The enraged people are about to  lynch the murderer, when three cannon shots are fired announcing that  it is Ash-Wednesday; the lights are extinguished and Cellini escapes in  the darkness.    The third act represents Cellini's atelier with the workmen in it.  Teresa, not finding her lover is in great distress.  Ascanio consoles  her, and {29} when the Miserere of the Penitents is heard, both join in  the prayer to the Holy Virgin.    Suddenly Cellini rushes in, and embracing Teresa, relates that he fled  the night before into a house.  A procession of penitent monks passing  by in the morning, he joined them, as their white cowls were similar to  his own disguise.  He decides to escape at once to Florence with  Teresa, but is already pursued by Balducci, who appears with Fieramosca  and insists on his daughter's returning and marrying the latter.  At  this moment the Cardinal Salviati steps in to look for the statue.  He  is highly indignant, that Cellini, thoughtless like all artists, has  not kept his promise.  Hearing him moreover accused by Balducci, he  threatens severe punishment and finally declares that Perseus shall be  cast by another.--Cellini in the pride of genius and full of rage  seizes a hammer, and, surrounded by his workmen declares, that he will  rather destroy his work than see it finished by another.    The Cardinal, overcome by fear of the loss, changes his tactics, and in  compliance with Cellini's request promises him full pardon and Teresa's  hand, if he finishes Perseus in an hour's time, as Cellini offers to  do.--Should he fail in his gigantic task, his life will be forfeit.

Sometimes I caught a glimpse of her head as she bounded upward with her  tambourine. Then I could hear the officers saying many things to her  which brought the blood to my face. As to her answers, I knew nothing  of them. It was on that day, I think, that I began to love her in  earnest--for three or four times I was tempted to rush into the _patio_,  and drive my sword into the bodies of all the coxcombs who were making  love to her. My torture lasted a full hour; then the gipsies came out,  and the carriage took them away. As she passed me by, Carmen looked at  me with those eyes you know, and said to me very low, 'Comrade, people  who are fond of good _fritata_ come to eat it at Lillas Pastia's at  Triana!'         * In most of the houses in Seville there is an inner court       surrounded by an arched portico. This is used as a sitting-       room in summer. Over the court is stretched a piece of tent       cloth, which is watered during the day and removed at night.       The street door is almost always left open, and the passage       leading to the court (_zaguan_) is closed by an iron lattice       of very elegant workmanship.    \"Then, light as a kid, she stepped into the carriage, the coachman  whipped up his mules, and the whole merry party departed, whither I know  not.    \"You may fancy that the moment I was off guard I went to Triana; but  first of all I got myself shaved and brushed myself up as if I had been  going on parade. She was living with Lillas Pastia, an old fried-fish  seller, a gipsy, as black as a Moor, to whose house a great many  civilians resorted to eat _fritata_, especially, I think, because Carmen  had taken up her quarters there.    \"'Lillas,' she said, as soon as she saw me. 'I'm not going to work any  more to-day. To-morrow will be a day, too.* Come, fellow-countryman, let  us go for a walk!'         * _Manana sera otro dia._--A Spanish proverb.    \"She pulled her mantilla across her nose, and there we were in the  street, without my knowing in the least whither I was bound.    \"'Senorita,' said I, 'I think I have to thank you for a present I  had while I was in prison. I've eaten the bread; the file will do for  sharpening my lance, and I keep it in remembrance of you. But as for the  money, here it is.'    \"'Why, he's kept the money!' she exclaimed, bursting out laughing.  'But, after all, that's all the better--for I'm decidedly hard up! What  matter! The dog that runs never starves!* Come, let's spend it all! You  shall treat.'         * _Chuquel sos pirela, cocal terela_. \"The dog that runs       finds a bone.\"--Gipsy proverb.    \"We had turned back toward Seville. At the entrance of the _Calle de  la Serpiente_ she bought a dozen oranges, which she made me put into my  handkerchief. A little farther on she bought a roll, a sausage, and  a bottle of manzanilla. Then, last of all, she turned into a  confectioner's shop. There she threw the gold coin I had returned to  her on the counter, with another she had in her pocket, and some small  silver, and then she asked me for all the money I had. All I possessed  was one peseta and a few cuartos, which I handed over to her, very much  ashamed of not having more. I thought she would have carried away the  whole shop. She took everything that was best and dearest, _yemas_,*  _turon_,** preserved fruits--as long as the money lasted. And all these,  too, I had to carry in paper bags. Perhaps you know the _Calle del  Candilejo_, where there is a head of Don Pedro the Avenger.*** That head  ought to have given me pause. We stopped at an old house in that street.  She passed into the entry, and knocked at a door on the ground floor.  It was opened by a gipsy, a thorough-paced servant of the devil. Carmen  said a few words to her in Romany. At first the old hag grumbled. To  smooth her down Carmen gave her a couple of oranges and a handful of  sugar-plums, and let her have a taste of wine. Then she hung her cloak  on her back, and led her to the door, which she fastened with a wooden  bar. As soon as we were alone she began to laugh and caper like a  lunatic, singing out, 'You are my _rom_, I'm your _romi_.'****         * Sugared yolks of eggs.         ** A sort of nougat.         *** This king, Don Pedro, whom we call \"the Cruel,\" and whom       Queen Isabella, the Catholic, never called anything but \"the       Avenger,\" was fond of walking about the streets of Seville       at night in search of adventures, like the Caliph Haroun al       Raschid. One night, in a lonely street, he quarrelled with a       man who was singing a serenade. There was a fight, and the       king killed the amorous _caballero_. At the clashing of       their swords, an old woman put her head out of the window       and lighted up the scene with a tiny lamp (candilejo) which       she held in her hand. My readers must be informed that King       Don Pedro, though nimble and muscular, suffered from one       strange fault in his physical conformation. Whenever he       walked his knees cracked loudly. By this cracking the old       woman easily recognised him. The next day the _veintiquatro_       in charge came to make his report to the king. \"Sir, a duel       was fought last night in such a street--one of the       combatants is dead.\" \"Have you found the murderer?\" \"Yes,       sir.\" \"Why has he not been punished already?\" \"Sir, I await       your orders!\" \"Carry out the law.\" Now the king had just       published a decree that every duellist was to have his head       cut off, and that head was to be set up on the scene of the       fight. The _veintiquatro_ got out of the difficulty like a       clever man. He had the head sawed off a statue of the king,       and set that up in a niche in the middle of the street in       which the murder had taken place. The king and all the       Sevillians thought this a very good joke. The street took       its name from the lamp held by the old woman, the only       witness of the incident. The above is the popular tradition.       Zuniga tells the story somewhat differently. However that       may be, a street called _Calle del Candilejo_ still exists       in Seville, and in that street there is a bust which is said       to be a portrait of Don Pedro. This bust, unfortunately, is       a modern production. During the seventeenth century the old       one had become very much defaced, and the municipality had       it replaced by that now to be seen.         **** _Rom_, husband. _Romi_, wife.    \"There I stood in the middle of the room, laden with all her purchases,  and not knowing where I was to put them down. She tumbled them all onto  the floor, and threw her arms round my neck, saying:    \"'I pay my debts, I pay my debts! That's the law of the _Cales_.'*         * _Calo_, feminine _calli_, plural _cales_. Literally       \"black,\" the name the gipsies apply to themselves in their       own language.    \"Ah, sir, that day! that day! When I think of it I forget what to-morrow  must bring me!\"    For a moment the bandit held his peace, then, when he had relighted his  cigar, he began afresh.    \"We spent the whole day together, eating, drinking, and so forth. When  she had stuffed herself with sugar-plums, like any child of six years  old, she thrust them by handfuls into the old woman's water-jar.  'That'll make sherbet for her,' she said. She smashed the _yemas_ by  throwing them against the walls. 'They'll keep the flies from bothering  us.' There was no prank or wild frolic she didn't indulge in. I told her  I should have liked to see her dance, only there were no castanets to  be had. Instantly she seized the old woman's only earthenware plate,  smashed it up, and there she was dancing the _Romalis_, and making the  bits of broken crockery rattle as well as if they had been ebony and  ivory castanets. That girl was good company, I can tell you! Evening  fell, and I heard the drums beating tattoo.    \"'I must get back to quarters for roll-call,' I said.    \"'To quarters!' she answered, with a look of scorn. 'Are you a negro  slave, to let yourself be driven with a ramrod like that! You are as  silly as a canary bird. Your dress suits your nature.* Pshaw! you've no  more heart than a chicken.'    * Spanish dragoons wear a yellow uniform.    \"I stayed on, making up my mind to the inevitable guard-room. The next  morning the first suggestion of parting came from her.    \"'Hark ye, Joseito,' she said. 'Have I paid you? By our law, I owed you  nothing, because you're a _payllo_. But you're a good-looking fellow,  and I took a fancy to you. Now we're quits. Good-day!'    \"I asked her when I should see her again.    \"'When you're less of a simpleton,' she retorted, with a laugh. Then, in  a more serious tone, 'Do you know, my son, I really believe I love you a  little; but that can't last! The dog and the wolf can't agree for long.  Perhaps if you turned gipsy, I might care to be your _romi_. But that's  all nonsense, such things aren't possible. Pshaw! my boy. Believe me,  you're well out of it. You've come across the devil--he isn't always  black--and you've not had your neck wrung. I wear a woollen suit, but  I'm no sheep.* Go and burn a candle to your _majari_,** she deserves  it well.
