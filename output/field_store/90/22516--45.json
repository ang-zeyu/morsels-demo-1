But who are the others?  I had no orders  about them from the master.\"    \"No, McMurdo?  You surprise me!  I told my brother last night that I  should bring some friends.\"    \"He ain't been out o' his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no  orders.  You know very well that I must stick to regulations. I can let  you in, but your friends must just stop where they are.\"    This was an unexpected obstacle.  Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a  perplexed and helpless manner.  \"This is too bad of you, McMurdo!\" he  said.  \"If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the young  lady, too.  She cannot wait on the public road at this hour.\"    \"Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,\" said the porter, inexorably.  \"Folk may be  friends o' yours, and yet no friends o' the master's.  He pays me well  to do my duty, and my duty I'll do.  I don't know none o' your friends.\"    \"Oh, yes you do, McMurdo,\" cried Sherlock Holmes, genially.  \"I don't  think you can have forgotten me.  Don't you remember the amateur who  fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your  benefit four years back?\"    \"Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\" roared the prize-fighter.  \"God's truth! how  could I have mistook you?  If instead o' standin' there so quiet you  had just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw,  I'd ha' known you without a question. Ah, you're one that has wasted  your gifts, you have!  You might have aimed high, if you had joined the  fancy.\"    \"You see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of the  scientific professions open to me,\" said Holmes, laughing.  \"Our friend  won't keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.\"    \"In you come, sir, in you come,--you and your friends,\" he answered.  \"Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to be  certain of your friends before I let them in.\"    Inside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of  a house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a  moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window.  The vast  size of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a  chill to the heart.  Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the  lantern quivered and rattled in his hand.    \"I cannot understand it,\" he said.  \"There must be some mistake. I  distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is no  light in his window.  I do not know what to make of it.\"    \"Does he always guard the premises in this way?\" asked Holmes.    \"Yes; he has followed my father's custom.  He was the favorite son, you  know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than  he ever told me.  That is Bartholomew's window up there where the  moonshine strikes.  It is quite bright, but there is no light from  within, I think.\"    \"None,\" said Holmes.  \"But I see the glint of a light in that little  window beside the door.\"    \"Ah, that is the housekeeper's room.  That is where old Mrs. Bernstone  sits.  She can tell us all about it.  But perhaps you would not mind  waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she  has no word of our coming she may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?\"    He held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of light  flickered and wavered all round us.  Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and  we all stood with thumping hearts, straining our ears. From the great  black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most  pitiful of sounds,--the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman.    \"It is Mrs. Bernstone,\" said Sholto.  \"She is the only woman in the  house.  Wait here.  I shall be back in a moment.\"  He hurried for the  door, and knocked in his peculiar way.  We could see a tall old woman  admit him, and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him.    \"Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come!  I am so glad you  have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!\"  We heard her reiterated rejoicings  until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled  monotone.    Our guide had left us the lantern.  Holmes swung it slowly round, and  peered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which  cumbered the grounds.  Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand  was in mine.  A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who  had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even  look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble  our hands instinctively sought for each other.  I have marvelled at it  since, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should  go out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also  the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection.  So we stood  hand in hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for  all the dark things that surrounded us.    \"What a strange place!\" she said, looking round.    \"It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it.  I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat,  where the prospectors had been at work.\"    \"And from the same cause,\" said Holmes.  \"These are the traces of the  treasure-seekers.  You must remember that they were six years looking  for it.  No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit.\"    At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto  came running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes.    \"There is something amiss with Bartholomew!\" he cried.  \"I am  frightened!  My nerves cannot stand it.\"  He was, indeed, half  blubbering with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from  the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a  terrified child.    \"Come into the house,\" said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way.    \"Yes, do!\" pleaded Thaddeus Sholto.  \"I really do not feel equal to  giving directions.\"    We all followed him into the housekeeper's room, which stood upon the  left-hand side of the passage.  The old woman was pacing up and down  with a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight of Miss  Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her.    \"God bless your sweet calm face!\" she cried, with an hysterical sob.  \"It does me good to see you.  Oh, but I have been sorely tried this  day!\"    Our companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few  words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the color back into the  others bloodless cheeks.    \"Master has locked himself in and will not answer me,\" she explained.  \"All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to be  alone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went up  and peeped through the key-hole.  You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus,--you  must go up and look for yourself.  I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto  in joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him with such  a face on him as that.\"    Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto's  teeth were chattering in his head.  So shaken was he that I had to pass  my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were  trembling under him.  Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out  of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be  mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served  as a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step, holding the  lamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left.  Miss Morstan had  remained behind with the frightened housekeeper.    The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length,  with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three  doors upon the left.  Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and  methodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long black  shadows streaming backwards down the corridor.  The third door was that  which we were seeking.  Holmes knocked without receiving any answer,  and then tried to turn the handle and force it open.  It was locked on  the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see  when we set our lamp up against it.  The key being turned, however, the  hole was not entirely closed.  Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and  instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath.    \"There is something devilish in this, Watson,\" said he, more moved than  I had ever before seen him.  \"What do you make of it?\"    I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror.  Moonlight was streaming  into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance.  Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all  beneath was in shadow, there hung a face,--the very face of our  companion Thaddeus.  There was the same high, shining head, the same  circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance.  The  features were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural  grin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the  nerves than any scowl or contortion.  So like was the face to that of  our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was  indeed with us.  Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us  that his brother and he were twins.    \"This is terrible!\" I said to Holmes.  \"What is to be done?\"    \"The door must come down,\" he answered, and, springing against it, he  put all his weight upon the lock.  It creaked and groaned, but did not  yield.  Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it  gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew  Sholto's chamber.    It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory.  A double  line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the  door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20987"],[0,"Story of the War in South Africa, 1899-1900 (#7)"],[1,"shelter; what {p.053} there was was found chiefly behind ant  hills, of which there were very many. The musketry fire here undergone  was severe, for the only diversion to it continued so far to be the  British artillery, the flanking movement not having yet fully  developed. Under the undivided attention of the enemy's riflemen, the  line worked its way steadily forward, men dropping frequently, to  within 800 yards of the summit, where they finally lay down and waited  under a constant fall of shot till the bugle should summon them to the  storm.    Meantime, during these last 400 yards, the flank attack was beginning.  In general, the first ascent was of the rocky, broken character before  noted, both here and at Talana; but, the strength of the Boer force  being on the other flank, the assailants, while mounting, were covered  by the slope and did not come fairly under fire until the top was  reached. Then they began to fall rapidly, but a few paces further the  ground dipped, and again gave momentary shelter. It was, however, but  to take breath for the final rush; if rush it can be called, which  meant steady, dogged bearing up against a pitiless rain {p.054} of  projectiles, and forcing one's way forward rock by rock, while  companions drop, one by one, on either side. Six hundred yards of such  work lay, before the flanking column, interrupted ever and anon by the  barbed-wire obstacles, which, however, were themselves often cut down  by the intensity of the fire.    Under such conditions the community of action which rests upon formal  organisation and method ceases to be effectual. The momentum that  endures to the end, and so effects the results of co-operation, finds  its energy partly in individual character, partly in the moral  fellowship of impulse and of purpose which, once imparted, remains  subconscious, perhaps, but ineradicable. The man knows, or rather  feels, that if he gets to the end he will find his comrades there; and  that if he goes back he will not find them, but his own self-contempt.  Such is unanimity, the oneness of will that comes of a common training  and of common ideals, bred-in, if not inborn. So this mass of men,  independent each, and yet members, each, one of the other, struggled  forward, through failing {p.055} light and drenching rain--for the  storm had burst as the ascent began--till half the way was won. Then  the bugle sounded \"Charge,\" and the reply came cheerily up from below.  The men, in the valley and on the hill, moved forward with the  bayonet, still not neglecting cover, but looking now more to speed.  Again, as usual, save a few of the more stubborn who were killed at  their guns, the defenders did not await the shock but fled down the  hills, where the cavalry that had accompanied the flank attack got  among them and completed their discomfiture.    The battle at Elandslaagte was distinctly creditable to both sides,  but upon the whole gave sounder cause for self-congratulation to the  British than to their opponents. The former were numerically superior  to the defenders, but not to an extent which countervailed even the  natural advantages of the ground, further improved by measures for  which time allowed.    Regarded apart from its connection with the campaign as a whole,  simply as a combat unrelated to other incidents, the conception and  the {p.056} execution of the attack were admirable; while in the  matter of military dynamic energy, to whatever source that shown on  the one side or the other may be attributed, the potentiality of the  attacking force was demonstrated to be greater than that of the  opponent.    Still more was the action at Elandslaagte commendable, when viewed in  relation to the general respective conditions of the Boers and the  British in Natal at that time.    Duly to appreciate the merits and the results of these two successive  days of fighting, at Talana and at Elandslaagte, it must be remembered  that the British in a general sense, and at Dundee locally as well,  were upon the defensive, and that the Boer movements were each a part  of one general plan directed, and most properly, to overwhelm and  destroy the detachments--Dundee and Ladysmith--in detail; they  together being rightly considered one fraction of the enemy's whole  force, present or hurrying over sea. So regarded, the vigour with  which the British took the initiative, assumed the offensive,  themselves in turn attacking in detail, and severely punishing, the  separate factors of the enemy's {p.057} combination, is worthy of  great praise. Sir Penn Symons is perhaps entitled to the greater meed  because to him fell, with the greater burden, the greater opportunity,  to which he proved not unequal.    Such men were worthy of the steady forward gallantry shown by officers  and men. Both leaders and led easily carry off the palm from the more  phlegmatic opponents, who failed to sweep them away. The result was to  save Ladysmith, or rather--what was most really important--to save the  organized force that was there shut in. The brilliant antecedent  campaign, the offensive right and left strokes, the prompt and timely  resolve of Yule to retreat just as he did, and the consequent  concentration, utterly frustrated the Boers' combinations, and  shattered antecedently their expectations of subduing the British by  the cheaper method of exhaustion. The failure was not only signal, but  in the end discreditable; for while success is no sure proof of merit,  nor its opposite of indesert, the wide miscalculation of the ultimate  result, which kept the Boers so long inactive before Ladysmith, and  saved Natal, while reinforcements were {p.058} well known all the  while to be hasting across the sea, is entitled to scant respect from  any indications in its favour. The faulty execution of the original  plan, which enabled the enemy to concentrate and to accumulate  adequate means of resistance, and the subsequent underestimate of the  endurance of the garrison, bear the same mark. In issuing their  ultimatum, in opening the campaign, in combining against Dundee, and  finally in investing Ladysmith, the Boers exceeded decisively that  five minutes of delay upon which, to use Nelson's words, turns victory  or defeat; and the loss of time, as yet only serious, through the  procrastinations of the siege became irremediable.    It is noticeable that the returns of casualties at Elandslaagte do not  perfectly bear out extreme conclusions as to the fatal preponderance  of the defence over the offence in modern warfare. As reported soon  after the action, the British lost in killed, 55; in wounded, 199. Of  the Boers, 65 dead were found on the ground; others, estimated--guessed  is perhaps more correct--at 50, were killed in pursuit by the cavalry.  Their wounded {p.059} is not stated, but there were many among the  three hundred prisoners taken. It is true, certainly, that in this  affair not only was the British attack well combined, but their  superiority in numbers was considerable. Still, after all deductions,  the greater loss of the defendants casts doubt, either upon their  marksmanship or upon the prevalent theory that the effects of modern  weapons are revolutionary. As a historical fact, a front attack upon  intrenched men, even irregulars, has been a desperate business as far  back, at least, as Bunker Hill and Fort Moultrie.    Twenty-four hours after Elandslaagte, at 9 P.M., Sunday, October 22,  Yule's men started on their march of sixty miles, of mountain climb  and over rain-drenched roads, to Ladysmith. Their own work at Talana  Hill had secured the left flank of their retreat, by the  demoralization of Meyer's force; to protect their right, the  increasing numbers and threatening movements of the enemy west of the  railroad impelled Sir George White to further action. On the 24th he  moved out a strong force, which discovered the {p.060} enemy at  Rietfontein, seven miles from Ladysmith, on a ridge west of, and  parallel to, the Glencoe road; their artillery intrenched in the  centre, and supported by infantry upon commanding elevations at either  end. The British drew up on a parallel ridge, to the eastward, and an  action ensued, confined mainly to artillery at 3,000 yards. In the end  the Boers, chiefly a body of Free State men, evacuated their positions  about 2 P.M. and retired to the westward. Pursuit was not attempted.  The security and junction of Yule's detachment was the prime immediate  necessity, and it was by this fully apparent that the time was come  when offensive returns, on the part of the greatly outnumbered  British, must be limited to those needed to insure necessary delay  before final inevitable interception and investment. It was no  occasion for displays of military fancy sparring.    Shortly after noon of Thursday, October 26, Yule's column marched into  Ladysmith--\"done up,\" telegraphed White, \"but in good spirits and only  need rest.\" The lamented Steevens, with his graphic pen, has described  for us the pride, pomp and circumstance of the return {p.061} of the  men who had stormed Talana Hill, and had still before them the grim  protracted realities of Ladysmith.    \"Before next morning was gray in came the 1st Rifles. They plashed  uphill to their blue-roofed huts on the south-west side of the town.  By the time the sun was up they were fed by their sister battalion,  the 2nd, and had begun to unwind their putties. But what a sight!  Their putties were not soaked and not caked; say, rather, that there  may have been a core of puttie inside, but that the men's legs were  imbedded in a serpentine cast of clay. As for their boots, you could  only infer them from the huge balls of stratified mud they bore round  their feet. Red mud, yellow mud, black mud, brown mud--they lifted  their feet toilsomely; they were land plummets that had sucked up  specimens of all the heavy, sticky soils for fifteen miles.
