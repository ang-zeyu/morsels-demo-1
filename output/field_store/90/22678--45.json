Not a few of the fabliaux are cynically gross--ribald but not  voluptuous. To literary distinction they made small pretence. It  sufficed if the tale ran easily in the current speech, thrown into  rhyming octosyllables; but brevity, frankness, natural movement are  no slight or common merits in mediaeval poetry, and something of the  social life of the time is mirrored in these humorous narratives.    To regard them as a satire of class against class, inspired by  indignation, is to misconceive their true character; they are rather  miniature comedies or caricatures, in which every class in turn  provides material for mirth. It may, however, be said that with the  writers of the fabliaux to hold woman in scorn is almost an article  of faith. Among these writers a few persons of secular rank or  dignified churchmen occasionally appeared; but what we may call the  professional rhymers and reciters were the humbler jongleurs  addressing a bourgeois audience--degraded clerics, unfrocked monks,  wandering students, who led a bohemian life of gaiety alternating  with misery. In the early part of the fourteenth century these errant  jongleurs ceased to be esteemed; the great lord attached a minstrel  to his household, and poetry grew more dignified, more elaborate in  its forms, more edifying in its intention, and in its dignity grew  too often dull. Still for a time fabliaux were written; but the age  of the jongleurs was over. _Virelais_, _rondeaux_, _ballades_,  _chants royaux_ were the newer fashion; and the old versified tale  of mirth and ribaldry was by the middle of the century a thing of  the past.      IV  THE ROMANCE OF THE ROSE    The most extraordinary production in verse of the thirteenth century  is undoubtedly _Le Roman de la Rose_. It is indeed no single  achievement, but two very remarkable poems, written at two different  periods, by two authors whose characters and gifts were not only alien,  but opposed--two poems which reflect two different conditions of  society. Of its twenty-two thousand octosyllabic lines, upwards of  four thousand are the work of GUILLAUME DE LORRIS; the remainder is  the work of a later writer, JEAN DE MEUN.    Lorris is a little town situated between Orleans and Montargis. Here,  about the year 1200, the earlier poet was born. He was a scholar,  at least as far as knowledge of Latin extends, and learned above all  in the lore of love. He died young, probably before 1230, and during  the five years that preceded his death the first part of _Le Roman  de la Rose_ was composed. Its subject is an allegorised tale of love,  his own or imagined, transferred to the realm of dreams. The writer  would fain win the heart of his beloved, and at the same time he would  instruct all amorous spirits in the art of love. He is twenty years  of age, in the May-morn of youth. He has beheld his beautiful lady,  and been charmed by her fairness, her grace, her courtesy; she has  received him with gentleness, but when he declares his love she grows  alarmed. He gains at last the kiss which tells of her affection; but  her parents intervening, throw obstacles between the lovers. Such,  divested of ornament, allegory, and personification, is the theme  of the poem.    To pluck the rose in the garden of delight is to win the maiden; her  fears, her virgin modesty and pride, her kindness, her pity, are the  company of friends or foes by whom the rose is surrounded; and to  harmonise the real and the ideal, all the incidents are placed in  the setting of a dream. Wandering one spring morning by the  river-banks, the dreamer finds himself outside the walls of a fair  orchard, owned by Deduit (Pleasure), of which the portress is Oiseuse  (Idleness); on the walls are painted figures of Hatred, Envy, Sadness,  Old Age, Poverty, and other evil powers; but unterrified by these,  he enters, and finds a company of dancers on the turf, among whom  is Beauty, led by the god of Love. Surrounded by a thorny hedge is  the rosebud on which all his desire now centres. He is wounded by  the arrows of Love, does homage to the god, and learns his commandments  and the evils and the gains of love. Invited by Bel-Accueil, the son  of Courtoisie, to approach the rose, he is driven back by Danger and  his companions, the guardians of the blossom. Raison descends from  a tower and discourses against the service of Love; Ami offers his  consolations; at length the lover is again admitted to the flowery  precinct, finds his rosebud half unclosed, and obtains the joy of  a kiss. But Jealousy raises an unscalable wall around the rose; the  serviceable Bel-Accueil is imprisoned, and with a long lament of the  lover, the poem (line 4068) closes.    Did Guillaume de Lorris ever complete his poem, or did he die while  it was still but half composed? We may conjecture that it wanted little  to reach some denouement--perhaps the fulfilment of the lover's  hopes; and it is not impossible that a lost fragment actually brought  the love-tale to its issue. But even if the story remained without  an end, we possess in Guillaume's poem a complete mediaeval Art of  Love; and if the amorous metaphysics are sometimes cold, conventional,  or laboured, we have gracious allegories, pieces of brilliant  description, vivid personifications, and something of ingenious  analysis of human passion. Nevertheless the work of this Middle-Age  disciple of Ovid and of Chretien de Troyes owes more than half its  celebrity to the continuation, conceived in an entirely opposite  spirit, by his successor, Jean de Meun.    The contrast is striking: Guillaume de Lorris was a refined and  graceful exponent of the conventional doctrine of love, a seemly  celebrant in the cult of woman, an ingenious decorator of accepted  ideas; Jean de Meun was a passionate and positive spirit, an ardent  speculator in social, political, and scientific questions, one who  cared nothing for amorous subtleties, and held woman in scorn.  Guillaume addressed an aristocratic audience, imbued with the  sentiments of chivalry; Jean was a bourgeois, eager to instruct, to  arouse, to inflame his fellows in a multitude of matters which  concerned the welfare of their lives. He was little concerned for  the lover and his rose, but was deeply interested in the condition  of society, the corruptions of religion, the advance of knowledge.  He turned from ideals which seemed spurious to reason and to nature;  he had read widely in Latin literature, and found much that suited  his mood and mind in Boethius' _De Consolatione Philosophiae_ and  in the _De Planctu Naturae_ of the \"universal doctor\" of the twelfth  century, Alain de Lille, from each of which he conveyed freely into  his poem. Of his life we know little; Jean Clopinel was born at Meun  on the Loire about the year 1240; he died before the close of 1305;  his continuation of Guillaume's _Roman_ was made about 1270. His later  poems, a _Testament_, in which he warned and exhorted his  contemporaries of every class, the _Codicille_, which incited to  almsgiving, and his numerous translations, prove the unabated energy  of his mind in his elder years.    The rose is plucked by the lover in the end; but lover and rose are  almost forgotten in Jean's zeal in setting forth his views of life,  and in forming an encyclopaedia of the knowledge of his time. Reason  discourses on the dangers of passion, commends friendship or  universal philanthropy as wiser than love, warns against the  instability of fortune and the deceits of riches, and sets charity  high above justice; if love be commendable, it is as the device of  nature for the continuation of the species. The way to win woman and  to keep her loyalty is now the unhappy way of squandered largess;  formerly it was not so in the golden age of equality, before private  property was known, when all men held in common the goods of the earth,  and robber kings were evils of the future. The god of Love and his  barons, with the hypocrite monk Faux-Semblant--a bitter satirist of  the mendicant orders--besiege the tower in which Bel-Accueil is  imprisoned, and by force and fraud an entrance is effected. The old  beldame, who watches over the captive, is corrupted by promises and  gifts, and frankly exposes her own iniquities and those of her sex.  War is waged against the guardians of the rose, Venus, sworn enemy  of chastity, aiding the assailants. Nature, devoted to the  continuance of the race, mourns over the violation of her laws by  man, unburdens herself of all her scientific lore in a confession  to her chaplain Genius, and sends him forth to encourage the lover's  party with a bold discourse against the crime of virginity. The  triumph of the lover closes the poem.    The graceful design of the earlier poet is disregarded; the love-story  becomes a mere frame for setting forth the views of Jean de Meun,  his criticism of the chivalric ideal, his satire upon the monkish  vices, his revolutionary notions respecting property and government,  his advanced opinions in science, his frank realism as to the  relations of man and woman. He possesses all the learning of his time,  and an accomplished judgment in the literature which he had studied.  He is a powerful satirist, and passages of narrative and description  show that he had a poet's feeling for beauty; he handles the language  with the strength and skill of a master. On the other hand, he lacks  all sense of proportion, and cannot shape an imaginative plan; his  prolixity wearies the reader, and it cannot be denied that as a moral  reformer he sometimes topples into immorality. The success of the  poem was extraordinary, and extended far beyond France. It was  attacked and defended, and up to the time of Ronsard its influence  on the progress of literature--encouraging, as it did, to excess the  art of allegory and personification--if less than has commonly been  alleged,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24708"],[0,"The Biology, Physiology and Sociology of Reproduction (#7)"],[1,"lowed, of course, by a relief of the  pressure which was the cause of the condition. This phenomenon has  been variously called _nocturnal emission_, \"pollution\" and  \"dreaming-off.\"    Vecki, a specialist in physiology, hygiene and pathology of the sexual  apparatus, says that the nocturnal emission is a normal physiological  phenomenon, the object of which is to relieve pressure in the seminal  vesicles, and that in normal cases it occurs in fairly regular  periods, these periods varying in length with different individuals,  according to their physical condition and habits, the period being two  to four weeks, usually; though a considerably longer or shorter  period would not be looked upon as pathological. Vecki describes the  normal nocturnal emission as being accompanied by an erection, erotic  dreams, and an orgasm, the subject being wholly unconscious of the  condition until he is awakened at the moment of orgasm. Normally, the  subject experiences on the following day a feeling of relief and  well-being and should, normally, be wholly free from headache,  depression or languor.    Inquiry among a large number of normal healthy men convinces the  author that it is not at all unusual for these emissions to occur as  infrequently as once in two months in normal healthy men. On the other  hand, it is not unusual for them to occur as frequently as once in ten  days or even once a week and still be within the physiological limit.  However, when the emission occurs as frequently as once per week, it  should be looked upon as abnormal if it is followed by depression,  headache or lassitude. Cases are not unusual in which the nocturnal  emission is experienced as often as three times in a week after which  there will be a period of two to four weeks without an emission,  followed again by very frequent emissions, and a free period. This  phenomenon is an individual peculiarity, and is not to be looked upon  as abnormal.    Cases of too frequent nocturnal emissions accompanied by languor and  headache are usually caused by irritability or lack of tonicity of  the sexual apparatus, particularly of the seminal vesicles and the  ducts. This irritability and loss of tone is not infrequently caused  by masturbation, though it may also be caused by excessive sexual  intercourse, making itself manifest, of course, in either case, on  cessation of the habit of masturbation or the excessive sexual  intercourse.    Another cause of too frequent nocturnal emissions and one wholly  separate from any abuse of the sexual function is irritability and  mechanical irritation of the sexual apparatus--perhaps especially the  membranous and prostatic portion of the urethra--caused by the  presence of an excessive amount of oxalates in the urine. Oxalates  occur in the urine in sharp angular crystals and would seem to be in a  high degree irritating to the tender mucous membrane of the upper part  of the urethra. The almost invariable presence of these crystals in  excess in those cases that have not been accounted for by abuse of the  sexual function leads one to adopt the plausible theory that the  crystals are the cause of the irritability. However, we must not lose  sight of the fact that these crystals may be simply an accompaniment  of the too frequent emissions, and that the presence of oxalates in  the urine may be caused by some disturbance in the nutritive processes  that go on in the body, which disturbance causes not only the  irritability of the sexual apparatus, but also the presence of the  crystals.    When the seminal vesicles are much distended it occurs not  infrequently that the passage of a hard mass of fecal material through  the rectum will, by simple mechanical pressure on the seminal  vesicles, force out a few drops, perhaps as much as a teaspoonful, of  the contents of the vesicles. This would be called an _involuntary  emission_, but the liquid passed out must not be looked upon as semen.  It is simply the secretion of the seminal vesicles, and in losing it,  one is not losing a vital fluid or a fluid, any portion of which would  be reabsorbed; he is simply losing a fluid which would, in the natural  course of events, have passed away within the next few days as a  nocturnal emission.    These details have been explained in order that the young man may  fully understand the physiology of his sexual apparatus and not be  disturbed by the advertisements or the pamphlet literature of  charlatans who make a business of frightening young men into the  belief that in these experiences they are losing \"vital fluid\"--that  they are victims of \"lost manhood,\" or that they are entering into a  condition of \"general debility\" and \"impotence.\" As an actual fact,  involuntary loss of vital fluid (spermatorrhea), is a rare case even  in the practice of specialists in genito-urinary diseases, and in  these rare cases, the condition is usually a result of very great  excesses, sexual debauchery or one of the sequelae of venereal disease.  [Read: Appendix 1, 13 and 17.]    e. =Testes.= No rational idea of the physiology of the testes can be  given without laying down as a fundamental physiological law, that  _the testes secrete under sexual stimulation only_. This same general  principle applies to all glands, i.e., that they secrete only under  the influence of some special stimulation. In harmony with that law,  the testes secrete only under the influence of sexual stimulation.    The sexual stimulation may be sub-divided into two general categories,  i.e., conscious sexual stimulation and subconscious sexual  stimulation.    _Conscious sexual stimulation_ is partly psychical and partly  physical. The physical stimulation is produced by physical proximity  of a member of the opposite sex. The physical and psychical phases of  conscious sexual stimulation are so intimately interwoven that it is  exceedingly difficult to discuss one without constant reference to the  other, and it may be said in this connection that the psychical  attitude of the two individuals of opposite sex who are brought into  close physical proximity will modify very greatly their local sexual  responses.    Reverting to the lower animals: when a female in rut or heat is  brought into proximity to the male, there seems to be on the part of  each animal a consciousness of the character and attitude of the other  animal and both animals are step by step excited by various physical  contacts and probably also psychical conditions to a high state of  sexual excitement, leading to the natural ultimate result, coitus, in  which event the sexual excitement culminates in the orgasm of the  male, which empties the secreted semen into the organs of the female.    It will be easily understood that, in human subjects whose social  relations permit them to indulge in coitus, close physical proximity,  and various caresses lead, step by step in the normal course of nature  to sexual excitement and sexual desire which culminates as described  above for the lower animals.    To revert to the function of the testes, we may say that during these  various stages of sexual stimulation and excitement the testes are  actively secreting thousands upon thousands of nascent spermatozoa,  which being released, are hurried along, partly by their own  flagellate movements and partly by the action of the cilia in the  ducts of the epididymis and the peristaltic contractions of the vas  deferens--hurried along the vas to the ampulla. If the period of  sexual excitement extends over fifteen to thirty minutes, the whole  duct system from the epididymis to the ampulla becomes gorged with the  secreted testicular product. This secretion consists of active motile  spermatozoa, of spermatic granules and of mucus. The latter is  secreted by the ducts of the epididymis and the vas deferens, the  testicle itself furnishing only spermatozoa, spermatic granules and a  small amount of liquid, just sufficient in quantity to float the  spermatozoa out of the testes into the ducts.    At the moment of sexual orgasm occurs what is known as, the emission  of semen. In this act the whole contents of the ampulla, vas deferens  and ducts of the epididymis, the contents of the seminal vesicles, and  the contents of the ducts of the prostate gland are all poured out by  spasmotic muscular contractions into the urethra and by contraction of  the walls of the urethra, ejected from that tube through the mouth of  the urethra. Thus, in the act of emission, there is an intimate mixing  together of the three contributions to the semen, i.e., the  _testicular, vesicular and prostatic_.    _Sub-conscious Sexual Stimulation._--Sub-conscious sexual stimulation  is not accompanied by erection or any mental or physical manifestation  of sexual excitement.    When a sexually mature individual is brought into more or less  intimate relations with a sexually mature individual of the opposite  sex under conditions where the secondary sexual qualities may have  free and unrestricted play, there can be no reasonable doubt that  both individuals experience a sub-conscious sexual stimulation which  will influence them both physically and psychically through  sub-conscious response of their sexual apparatus. One can easily  imagine, for example, that a young man may meet upon the skating rink  in winter a young lady for whom he has a very sincere admiration and  respect; she on the other hand entertains for him a similar admiration  and respect. They may skate together the whole afternoon and converse  upon politics, art or philosophy, the young woman feeling herself  swung along--almost actually carried on her companion's strong arm.  The whole experience is, in the highest degree, pleasurable and  exhilarating to her, yet she may be conscious of absolutely no sexual  stimulation. On the other hand, the young man experiences most exalted  pleasure in the company of his young lady friend--through the pressure  of her"]]]
