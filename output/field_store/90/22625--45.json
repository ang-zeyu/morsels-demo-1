The external genital organs are  swollen, discolored, or show a discharge as a result of local disease or  from disease higher in the tract.    The manner of urinating is sometimes of considerable diagnostic  importance. Painful urination is shown by frequent attempts, during  which but a small quantity of urine is passed; by groaning, by  constrained attitude, etc. This condition comes from inflammation of the  bladder or urethra, urinary calculi (stones of the bladder or urethra),  hemorrhage, tumors, bruises, etc. The urine is retained from spasms of  the muscle at the neck of the bladder, from calculi, inflammatory  growths, tumors, and paralysis of the bladder.    The urine dribbles without control when the neck of the bladder is  weakened or paralyzed. This condition is seen after the bladder is  weakened from long-continued retention and where there is a partial  paralysis of the hind quarters.    Horses usually void urine five to seven times a day, and pass from 4 to  7 quarts. Disease may be shown by increase in the number of voidings or  of the quantity. Frequent urination indicates an irritable or painful  condition of the bladder or urethra or that the quantity is excessive.  In one form of chronic inflammation of the kidneys (interstitial  nephritis) and in polyuria the quantity may be increased to 20 or 30  quarts daily. Diminution in the quantity of urine comes from profuse  sweating, diarrhea, high fever, weak heart, diseased and nonsecreting  kidneys, or an obstruction to the flow.    The urine of the healthy horse is a pale or at times a slightly reddish  yellow. The color is less intense when the quantity is large, and is  more intense when the quantity is diminished. Dark-brown urine is seen  in azoturia and in severe acute muscular rheumatism. A brownish-green  color is seen in jaundice. Red color indicates admixture of blood from a  bleeding point at some part of the urinary tract, usually in the  kidneys.    The urine of the healthy horse is not clear and transparent. It contains  mucus, which causes it to be slightly thick and stringy, and a certain  amount of undissolved carbonates, causing it to be cloudy. A sediment  collects when the urine is allowed to stand. The urine of the horse is  normally alkaline. If it becomes acid the bodies in suspension are  dissolved and the urine is made clear. The urine may be unusually cloudy  from the addition of abnormal constituents, but to determine their  character a chemical or microscopic examination is necessary. Red or  reddish flakes or clumps in the urine are always abnormal, and denote a  hemorrhage or suppuration in the urinary tract.    The normal specific gravity of the urine of the horse is about 1.040. It  is increased when the urine is scanty and decreased when the quantity is  excessive.    Acid reaction of the urine occurs in chronic intestinal catarrh, in high  fever, and during starvation. Chemical and microscopic tests and  examinations are often of great importance in diagnosis, but require  special apparatus and skill.    Other points in the examination of a sick horse require more discussion  than can be afforded in this connection, and require special training on  the part of the examiner. Among such points may be mentioned the  examination of the organs of special sense, the examination of the  blood, the microscopic examination of the secretions and excretions,  bacteriological examinations of the secretions, excretions, and tissues,  specific reaction tests, and diagnostic inoculation.          FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF DISEASE.    By RUSH SHIPPEN HUIDEKOPER, M. D., VET.    [Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]      ANIMAL TISSUES.    The nonprofessional reader may regard the animal tissues, which are  subject to inflammation, as excessively simple structures, as similar,  simple, and fixed in their organization as the joists and boards which  frame a house, the bricks and iron coils of pipe which build a furnace,  or the stones and mortar which make the support of a great railroad  bridge. Yet while the principles of structure are thus simple, for the  general understanding by the student who begins their study the complete  appreciation of the shades of variation, which differentiate one tissue  from another, which define a sound tendon or a ligament from a fibrous  band--the result of disease filling in an old lesion and tying one organ  with another--is as complicated as the nicest jointing of Chinese  woodwork, the building of a furnace for the most difficult chemical  analysis, or the construction of a bridge which will stand for ages and  resist any force or weight.    All tissues are composed of certain fundamental and similar elements  which are governed by the same rules of life, though at first glance  they may appear to be widely different. These are (a) amorphous  substances, (b) fibers, and (c) cells.    (a) Amorphous substances may be in liquid form, as in the fluid of the  blood, which holds a vast amount of salts and nutritive matter in  solution; or they may be in a semiliquid condition, as the plasma which  infiltrates the loose meshes of connective tissue and lubricates the  surface of some membranes; or they may be in the form of a glue or  cement, fastening one structure to another, as a tendon or muscle end to  a bone; or, again, they hold similar elements firmly together, as in  bone, where they form a stiff matrix which becomes impregnated with lime  salts. Amorphous substances, again, form the protoplasm or nutritive  element of cells or the elements of life.    (b) Fibers are formed of elements of organic matter which have only a  passive function. They can be assimilated to little strings, or cords,  tangled one with another like a mass of waste yarn, woven regularly like  a cloth, or bound together like a rope. They are of two kinds--white  connective tissue fibers, only slightly extensible, pliable, and very  strong, and yellow elastic fibers, elastic, curly, ramified, and very  dense. These fibers once created require the constant presence of fluids  around them in order to retain their functional condition, as a piece of  harness leather demands continual oiling to keep its strength, but they  undergo no change or alteration in their form until destroyed by death.    (c) Cells, which may even be regarded as low forms of life, are masses  of protoplasm or amorphous living matter, with a nucleus and frequently  a nucleolus, which are capable of assimilating nutriment or food,  propagating themselves either into others of the same form or into fixed  cells of another outward appearance and different function but of the  same constitution. It is simply in the mode of the grouping of these  elements that we have the variation in tissues, as (1) loose connective  tissue, (2) aponeurosis and tendons, (3) muscles, (4) cartilage, (5)  bones, (6) epithelia and endothelia, (7) nerves.    (1) Loose connective tissue forms the great framework, or scaffolding,  of the body, and is found under the skin, between the muscles  surrounding the bones and blood vessels, and entering into the  structures of almost all the organs. In this the fibers are loosely  meshed together like a sponge, leaving spaces in which the nutrient  fluid and cells are irregularly distributed. This tissue we find in the  skin, in the spaces between the organs of the body where fat  accumulates, and as the framework of all glands.    (2) Aponeurosis and tendons are structures which serve for the  termination of muscles and for their contention, and for the attachment  of bones together. In these the fibers are more frequent and dense, and  are arranged with regularity, either crossing each other or lying  parallel, and here the cells are found in minimum quantity.    (3) In the muscles the cells lie end to end, forming long fibers which  have the power of contraction, and the connective tissue is in small  quantity, serving the passive purpose of a band around the contractile  elements.    (4) In cartilage a mass of firm amorphous substance, with no vascularity  and little vitality, forms the bed for the chondroplasts, or cells of  this tissue.    (5) Bone differs from the above in having the amorphous matter  impregnated with lime salts, which gives it its rigidity and firmness.    (6) Epithelia and endothelia, or the membranes which cover the body and  line all its cavities and glands, are made up of single or stratified  and multiple layers of cells bound together by a glue of amorphous  substance and resting on a layer composed of fibers. When the membrane  serves for secreting or excreting purposes, as in the salivary glands or  the kidneys, it is usually simple; when it serves the mechanical purpose  of protecting a part, as over the tongue or skin, it is invariably  multiple and stratified, the surface wearing away while new cells  replace it from beneath.    (7) In nerves, stellate cells are connected by their rays to each other,  or to fibers which conduct the nerve impressions, or they act as  receptacles, storehouses, and transmitters for them, as the switch-board  of a telephone system serves to connect the various wires.    All these tissues are supplied with blood in greater or less quantity.  The vascularity depends upon the function which the tissue is called  upon to perform. If this is great, as in the tongue, the lungs, or the  sensitive part of the hoof, a large quantity of blood is required; if  the labor is a passive one, as in cartilage, the membrane over the  withers, or the tendons of the legs, the vessels only reach the  periphery, and nutrition is furnished by imbibition of the fluids  brought to their surface by the blood vessels.    Blood is brought to the tissues by arterioles, or the small terminations  of the arteries, and is carried off from them by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2343"],[0,"The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge (#7)"],[1,"statement.  It was  Holmes who broke the silence.    \"Our difficulties are not over,\" he remarked, shaking his head. \"Our  police work ends, but our legal work begins.\"    \"Exactly,\" said I.  \"A plausible lawyer could make it out as an act of  self-defence.  There may be a hundred crimes in the background, but it  is only on this one that they can be tried.\"    \"Come, come,\" said Baynes cheerily, \"I think better of the law than  that.  Self-defence is one thing.  To entice a man in cold blood with  the object of murdering him is another, whatever danger you may fear  from him.  No, no, we shall all be justified when we see the tenants of  High Gable at the next Guildford Assizes.\"            *           *           *    It is a matter of history, however, that a little time was still to  elapse before the Tiger of San Pedro should meet with his deserts.  Wily and bold, he and his companion threw their pursuer off their track  by entering a lodging-house in Edmonton Street and leaving by the  back-gate into Curzon Square.  From that day they were seen no more in  England.  Some six months afterwards the Marquess of Montalva and  Signor Rulli, his secretary, were both murdered in their rooms at the  Hotel Escurial at Madrid. The crime was ascribed to Nihilism, and the  murderers were never arrested.  Inspector Baynes visited us at Baker  Street with a printed description of the dark face of the secretary,  and of the masterful features, the magnetic black eyes, and the tufted  brows of his master.  We could not doubt that justice, if belated, had  come at last.    \"A chaotic case, my dear Watson,\" said Holmes over an evening pipe. \"It  will not be possible for you to present in that compact form which is  dear to your heart.  It covers two continents, concerns two groups of  mysterious persons, and is further complicated by the highly  respectable presence of our friend, Scott Eccles, whose inclusion shows  me that the deceased Garcia had a scheming mind and a well-developed  instinct of self-preservation.  It is remarkable only for the fact that  amid a perfect jungle of possibilities we, with our worthy  collaborator, the inspector, have kept our close hold on the essentials  and so been guided along the crooked and winding path.  Is there any  point which is not quite clear to you?\"    \"The object of the mulatto cook's return?\"    \"I think that the strange creature in the kitchen may account for it.  The man was a primitive savage from the backwoods of San Pedro, and  this was his fetish.  When his companion and he had fled to some  prearranged retreat--already occupied, no doubt by a confederate--the  companion had persuaded him to leave so compromising an article of  furniture.  But the mulatto's heart was with it, and he was driven back  to it next day, when, on reconnoitering through the window, he found  policeman Walters in possession.  He waited three days longer, and then  his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more.  Inspector  Baynes, who, with his usual astuteness, had minimized the incident  before me, had really recognized its importance and had left a trap  into which the creature walked.  Any other point, Watson?\"    \"The torn bird, the pail of blood, the charred bones, all the mystery  of that weird kitchen?\"    Holmes smiled as he turned up an entry in his note-book.    \"I spent a morning in the British Museum reading up on that and other  points.  Here is a quotation from Eckermann's Voodooism and the Negroid  Religions:    \"'The true voodoo-worshipper attempts nothing of importance without  certain sacrifices which are intended to propitiate his unclean gods.  In extreme cases these rites take the form of human sacrifices followed  by cannibalism.  The more usual victims are a white cock, which is  plucked in pieces alive, or a black goat, whose throat is cut and body  burned.'    \"So you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual. It is  grotesque, Watson,\" Holmes added, as he slowly fastened his notebook,  \"but, as I have had occasion to remark, there is but one step from the  grotesque to the horrible.\""]]]
