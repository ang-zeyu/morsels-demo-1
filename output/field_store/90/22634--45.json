She drew her straight  dark brows together in a displeased frown, and deliberately turned her  face away.    By this time perhaps a dozen girls had entered, and, as the clang of the  third bell echoed through the school, an alert little man with a thin,  sensitive face and timid brown eyes, bustled into the room and carefully  closed the door. Hardly had he taken his hand from the knob when the  door was flung open, this time to admit a sharp-featured girl with  bright, dark eyes and a cruel, thin-lipped mouth. Smiling maliciously,  she swung the door shut with an echoing bang. The meek little professor  looked reproachfully at the offender, who did not even appear to see  him.    \"The Evil Genius,\" recognized Marjorie. Her eyes strayed furtively  toward the Mary girl, who had not paid the slightest attention to this  late arrival. \"What a hateful person that black-eyed girl is,\" ran on  Marjorie's thoughts. \"I know it was she who made that nice girl cry the  other day. I wish she wasn't quite so distant. The nice girl, I mean.  Oh, dear. I forgot to go up to the professor's desk and register. That's  his fault. He came in late. He'll see me in a minute and ask who I am.\"    To her extreme surprise, the little man paid no particular attention to  her, but, opening his grammar, began the giving out of the next day's  lesson. This he explained volubly and with many gestures. Marjorie's  lips curved into a half smile as she compared this rather noisy  instructor with Professor Rousseau, of Franklin. Later, when he called  upon his pupils to recite, however, he was a different being. His  politely sarcastic arraignment of those who floundered through the  lessons, accompanied by certain ominous marks he placed after their  names in a fat black book that lay on his desk, plainly showed that,  despite his mild appearance, he was a force yet to be reckoned with.    \"I hope he doesn't notice me until class is over,\" fidgeted Marjorie.  \"It surely must be time for that bell to ring.\" She began nervously to  count those who were due to recite before her turn came. It would be so  embarrassing to do her explaining before this group of strange girls,  particularly before the Evil Genius. Ah, she had begun to read! And how  beautifully she read French! The critical professor was listening to the  smooth flow of words that tripped from her tongue with approbation  written on every feature. \"She must have studied French before,\"  speculated Marjorie, as the professor directed the next girl to go on  with the exercise; \"or else she is French. I believe she is. Oh, dear,  only two more girls.\"    Clang! sounded the bell.    \"Thank goodness,\" breathed the relieved freshman.    There was a general closing of books. \"To-morrow I shall geev you a  wreetten test,\" warned Professor Fontaine. Then the second bell rang,  and the class filed out of the room.    \"Eet ees not strange that I haf overlooked you, Mademoiselle,\" explained  Professor Fontaine five minutes later, after listening to Marjorie's  apology for not presenting herself to him before class. \"The freshmen  like to make so many alterations in their programs. They haf soch good  excuses for changeeng classes, but, sometimes, too, they do not tell  me. Eet maks exasperation.\" He waved his hands comprehensively. \"I am  pleased,\" he added, with true French courtesy, \"to haf another pupil.  Ees eet that you like the French, Mademoiselle Dean?\"    \"It is a beautiful language, Professor Fontaine,\" Marjorie assured him.  \"I have only begun learning it, but I like it so much.\"    \"C'est vrai,\" murmured the delighted professor. \"La Francais est une  belle langue. If, then, you like it, you weel study your lessons, n'est  pas?\"    \"I'll try very hard to make good recitations. I will bring my books  to-morrow. We used the same grammar at Franklin High School.\"    Marjorie hastened back to the study hall to find it empty. The clock on  the north wall pointed significant hands to ten minutes past twelve. The  Picture Girl had said that she wished Marjorie to meet her friends, but  she was not waiting. It was disappointing, but her own fault, thought  the lonely freshman as she left the study hall and went slowly  downstairs to the locker room. She gave an impatient sigh as she pinned  on her hat. Exploring new territory wasn't half so interesting as she  could wish. Then a light footstep sounded at her side. A dignified  little voice said, stiffly, \"Will you please allow me to get my hat?\"    Marjorie whirled about in amazement. Could she believe her eyes? The  voice belonged to the Mary girl; they were to share the same locker.          CHAPTER VI    THE PLEDGE      \"Oh, I am so glad we are to have a locker together!\" exclaimed Marjorie,  impulsively. \"I've been very anxious to know you. I really owe you an  apology. I spoke to you in the street the other day. I don't know what  you thought of me, but you look so much like my dearest chum in  B---- that I called to you before I realized what I was doing.\"    The other girl regarded Marjorie with the suspicious, uneasy eyes of a  cornered animal. Then, without answering, she reached for her hat and  was about to go silently on her way, when something in Marjorie's  gracious words seemed to touch her and she said, grudgingly, \"I remember  you.\"    \"That's nice,\" beamed Marjorie. \"I was afraid you wouldn't. Let me tell  you about my chum.\" She launched forth in an enthusiastic description of  Mary Raymond and of their long friendship. \"I wrote Mary about having  seen a girl that looked like her. She will be very curious to see you.  She's coming to visit me some time during the year. So I hope you and I  will be friends. But I haven't even told you who I am. My name is  Marjorie Dean. Won't you please tell me yours?\" She offered her hand  winningly, but the strange, self-contained young girl ignored it.    \"My name is Constance Stevens.\" Her voice was coldly reluctant, carrying  with it an unmistakable rebuff.    Marjorie drew back, puzzled and hurt. She was not used to having her  friendly overtures rejected. The blue-eyed girl saw the shrinking  movement, and, stirred by some hitherto unknown impulse, stretched forth  her hand. \"Please forgive me for being so rude,\" she said contritely.  \"It is awfully sweet in you to tell me about your chum and to say that  you wish to be my friend. You are the first girl, who has been so nice  with me since I came to Sanford. How I hate them!\" Her expressive face  darkened and her blue eyes became filled with brooding, sullen anger.    \"Are you going home to luncheon now?\" asked Marjorie, with a view toward  keeping away from disagreeable subjects.    The other girl nodded, then, pinning on her hat, the two left the  building. Marjorie wished to ask questions, but she did not know how to  begin with this strange, moody girl. There were so many things to say.  \"Do you play basketball?\" she asked, almost timidly, when they had  traversed three blocks in silence.    Constance shook her head. \"I don't even know the game, let alone trying  to play it. Do you play?\"    \"Yes. I have played every position on the team. I was chosen for center  of the freshman team at Franklin High just before I came here. One of  the freshmen has asked me to go to the tryout on Friday.\"    The Mary girl looked wistfully at Marjorie. \"I'm going to tell you  something,\" she announced with finality. \"Truly, it's for your own good.  You mustn't try to be friends with me. If you do, you'll be sorry. We,  my father and I, are nobodies in this town. Father's a broken-down  musician who teaches the violin for a living. I've a little lame  brother, and we take care of a poor old musician, who, people say, is  crazy. He isn't, though. He's merely childish.    \"People call us Bohemians and gypsies and even vagabonds. They don't  understand that our greatest crime is just being poor. The girls in the  freshman class make fun of me and call me a tramp and a beggar behind my  back. One girl did try to be the least bit pleasant with me, but she  soon stopped. We've been in Sanford only two months, but it seems like a  hundred years. At first I was glad to think I was going to high school.  How I hate it now! But they sha'n't drive me away. I'll get my  education in spite of everything.\" Her lips drew together with resolute  purpose.    \"So, you see,\" her voice grew gentle, \"you mustn't waste your time upon  me. The girls won't like you if you do, and you don't know how dreadful  it is to be left out of everything. Of course, you can speak to me,  but----\" She paused and looked eloquent meaning at Marjorie. Her late  aloofness had quite vanished. Her small face was now soft and friendly,  making the resemblance to happy-go-lucky Mary Raymond more apparent.    Marjorie laughed. Those who knew her best would have understood that her  laughter meant defiance. \"I don't choose my friends because they are  rich or because others like them. I choose them because I want them  myself,\" she declared with a proud lift of her head. \"I knew that  someone had been horrid to you the first day I ever saw you. I heard  several girls talking of you afterward. At least, I think they were  talking of you. I said to myself then that they had misjudged you. So I  went home and wrote my letter to Mary. I told mother all about you, too,  and that I was going to be your friend, if you would let me. I want you  to come and see me and meet mother and father. As for the girls in the  freshman class, I'd like to be friends with them, too, but I couldn't do  anything so contemptible and unfair as to dislike a girl just because  they thought they did. Now, you know what I think about it. Are we  going to share our locker and our troubles and our pleasures?\"    The tears flashed across Constance Stevens' eyes. Her hand slid into  Marjorie's, and thus began a friendship between the two freshmen that  was to defy time and change. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23650"],[0,"Ten Boys from History (#7)"],[1,"in many of the country districts. Every district has its own  costume peculiar to its inhabitants, and the many colours of these  costumes, the curious caps worn with them, the heavy wooden shoes, or  sabots, which all true Dutch people wear, and the clothes worn by the  men, so different from the conventional dress of men of other nations,  make a picturesque and interesting sight when the Dutch people are  gathered together on the day of a \"Pardon\" or religious fete day.    Their homes, too, are quaint and strange in appearance to our  conventional eyes, and it has been said that the Dutch people dressed  up like quaint dolls, with their gay little homes and their little  canals, which cut up their bright green fields into many sections, live  in a country which is like a charming, attractive toy, it is so clean,  so tidy and so bright, and it seems a natural thing that the gorgeous  tulip should be their favourite flower. And that brings us back to the  old town of Haarlem in whose roads we were wandering on an April day.    Now one of the greatest differences between Holland and other  countries, is that it lies below the level of the sea, and so has to be  very carefully guarded from the surging flood at its very door, or it  would be either swept bare by the relentless sea, or entirely wiped out  of existence. To prevent this calamity the patient Dutchmen have built  wonderful dykes which guard their little country and keep the tyrant  sea in check. These dykes are huge banks of earth which tower high  above the lowlands and are the only safeguards of the country. Of  course, these dykes could only be made gradually, as the sea was turned  from one spot to another by dams and locks, and no greater proof of  Dutch industry and patience is shown than the way they have protected  their land from the sea.    When a dyke has been built, then on the edge of it, a windmill is  erected, which works a pump, and as the windmill draws up the water  from the sea, it is discharged into a canal. These canals which flow  through all Holland in a network of winding ways, run to the sea, and  where they meet the sea, in the dykes, great oaken gates, called  sluices are placed across the entrance to the canals, to regulate the  amount of water which shall flow into the canals, from the sea. These  gates are in charge of men called _sluicers_ whose duty it is, when  water is needed, to open the gates more or less, according to the  amount of water required, and then to close them carefully at night, so  that too much water may not flow into the canals, overflow them, and  flood the whole country. Even the smallest child in Holland is brought  up with a keen knowledge of the grave importance of a sluicer's duty  and of the danger to the country if he should neglect it, and the men  chosen for that position are always those whose reputation for faithful  service is unchallenged.    Naturally, a country lying as Holland lies is very damp and misty, and  its entire surface is covered with the network of canals running  through the meadows to the sea. If you could stand on a hill and look  down on it, it would look like an enormous puzzle, consisting of  hundreds of small vivid green pieces cut apart by the canals and  decorated by the quaint red-roofed houses of which we have spoken.    Through all the canals flows the same water, and all of them are  connected with each other, and are so very wide in some places that  there is much traffic on them. Then, too, through miles of the green  fields flow the narrower canals, draining the pasturelands, and  everywhere one feels the nearness and the menace of the everlasting  sea, and the protection of the dykes rearing the huge bulwarks between  the peaceful country and its treacherous enemy.    And that brings us back again to Haarlem on that April day when the  quaint little town was gay with the red and yellow tulips and the air  sweet with the scent of hyacinths.    On that bright spring day a little boy whose name is said to have been  Peter, and whose father was a sluicer, had for his dinner some cakes of  which he was very fond, and which his mother had baked because she knew  how much Peter liked them.    Peter was a very unselfish boy, and whenever he had anything he liked,  his first thought always was to share it with someone else. So, as soon  as he had finished his meal, he jumped up from the table and begged his  mother to let him go to see a poor blind man who lived not far away,  and to let him carry with him those cakes which had not been eaten.    His mother was pleased with this thought of Peter's for the poor old  man, and at once brought a basket and filled it with cakes for him to  carry to the invalid, while Peter's father was making him promise not  to stay out too late, and soon the boy was on his way to his friends,  happy in the beauty of the day, and in the thought of the pleasure his  present would give the blind man.    And he was not mistaken, the old man was delighted with the cakes, and  at once broke and ate one, while he began to tell Peter one of the  stories for which he was famous, and which he knew Peter loved to hear.  But Peter suddenly remembered his promise not to stay out late, and  finally became so uneasy that he told the old man he must not wait to  hear the end of the story, and, hastily bidding him farewell, started  towards home.    His path lay beside the dyke, and along its grassy banks grew beautiful  wild flowers of many varieties, so numerous and attractive that Peter  decided to pick a bunch of them to carry home to his mother, who was so  much of an invalid that she was seldom out of the house. So he picked a  few here and a few there--blue and yellow and pink, until he had a  handful of those varieties of which he knew his mother was most fond,  and as he walked on, to keep himself from feeling lonesome, he hummed a  gay little song.    Presently, he stopped, and neither sang nor smiled, as he looked at a  slender thread of water trickling through the grass. Where did it come  from? Surely not from the canal, and there was nowhere else for it to  come from unless it came from the dyke itself.    The thought was enough to make even a child turn pale and tremble. Only  the dykes stood between the boundless sea and the safety of little  Holland. He looked again, and to his imagination, the stream seemed  greater already. What could he do? Night was coming on, the road was a  solitary one. There was only the barest chance of anyone passing that  way whom he might hail, or of whom he could ask advice.    Then came a quick recollection of his promise to his father, and he  started homeward again, but a force as mighty as a giant's grasp, made  him turn back again to watch that trickling stream of water.    He was near one of the great oaken sluices, and bounding up beside it  he carefully examined the dyke. There, as small as his finger, was a  hole--strange and unaccountable happening,--and through that little  hole was flowing the stream of water at his feet.    Like lightning the flash of intuition came to Peter, if that hole were  not stopped up instantly, the force of the flow through it would  rapidly increase from the pounding of that mighty sea behind it. In a  night the flood would break through the dyke and perhaps destroy all  the homes in Holland.    What could he do? No stone would fit the hole, no amount of earth  packed into the crevice could resist the pressure of the water. Peter  was desperate. Forgotten now were his bunch of flowers which fell  unheeded from his hand. He strained his eyes in a vain search for  travellers on that lonely road, vainly he shouted out for help until  his throat was hoarse. What could he do? It was no common instinct that  came in that lightning flash to Peter. Climbing again up the steep  bank, from stone to stone, he thrust his finger in the hole and, oh,  joy, it fitted! It stopped the trickling water for the moment, but, oh,  what would happen when he took it out?    Ah, it was as clear as daylight, what to do. He would not take it out  until someone should come to relieve him. Forgetful of what this idea  might bring to him, if carried out, he chuckled with a boyish delight  in this real adventure.    \"Ha, ha!\" he said to himself. \"The water _can't_ come down now. Haarlem  shall not be drowned while I am here to keep the flood back.\"    For awhile excitement kept him warm and fearless. Then the chill  darkness of the night surrounded him. All sorts of strange noises fell  upon his unaccustomed ears, he seemed to see giants and demons lurking  near, ready to pounce upon him and kill him. Although he was a sturdy  lad, tears came at last, when he could no longer keep back thoughts of  his comfortable bed at home, of the parents who might be even then  worrying about his safety, although as he before remained over night  with the old man, Jansen, he felt that his mother and father had  probably gone to bed and to sleep, while he was out in the dark night  alone and in such a misery of pain. The pain grew greater, the misery  harder to bear every moment now, and still Peter kept his finger in  that dangerous hole.    He tried to whistle, hoping to attract the attention of some straggling  traveller, but his teeth chattered so much that he gave it up, and then  he remembered what he had been taught at his mother's knee, and Peter  prayed to the great God who could control the surging sea and protect a  boy who was doing his best. Peter was only a child, but if he ever  prayed with his whole heart, he prayed so that night in the darkness,  with his numbed finger thrust through that hole in the dyke, and when  his prayer was said he somehow felt braver, stronger and older than  before, and in his heart he said:    \"I will not take it out till someone comes. I will stay till morning.\"    Longer and longer grew the hours, the minutes, the seconds, and yet he  never moved--there were"]]]
