The invention of the  amber snow-glass is an even greater blessing to the traveller in the  north than the invention of the thermos bottle. No test could be more  severe than that which we put these glasses to.    We were now at the farthest point at which it was possible to use the  dogs, at our actual climbing base, and the time had come for Johnny and  the dogs to go down to the base camp for good. We should have liked to  keep the boy, so good-natured and amiable he was and so keen for further  climbing; but the dogs must be tended, and the main food for them was  yet to seek on the foot-hills with the rifle. So on 9th May down they  went, Tatum and the writer escorting them with the rope past the  crevasses as far as the first glacier camp, and then toiling slowly up  the glacier again, thankful that it was for the last time. That was one  of the sultriest and most sweltering days either of us ever remembered,  a moist heat of sun beating down through vapor, with never a breath of  breeze--a stifling, stewing day that, with the steep climb added,  completely exhausted and prostrated us.    [Sidenote: The Great Ice-Fall]    It is important that the reader should be able to see, in his mind's  eye, the situation of our camp at the head of the glacier, because to do  so is to grasp the simple orography of this face of the mountain, and to  understand the route of its ascent, probably the only route by which it  can be ascended. Standing beside the tent, facing in the direction we  have journeyed, the great highway of the glacier comes to an abrupt end,  a cul-de-sac. On the right hand the wall of the glacier towers up, with  enormous precipitous cliffs incrusted with hanging ice, to the North  Peak of the mountain, eight or nine thousand feet above us. About at  right angles to the end of the glacier, and four thousand feet above it,  is another glacier, which discharges by an almost perpendicular ice-fall  upon the floor of the glacier below.[2] The left-hand wall of the  glacier, described some pages back as a stupendous escarpment of  ice-covered rock, breaks rapidly down into a comparatively low ridge,  which sweeps to the right, encloses the head of the glacier, and then  rises rapidly to the glacier above, and still rises to form the  left-hand wall of that glacier, and finally the southern or higher peak  of the mountain.    So the upper glacier separates the two great peaks of the mountain and  discharges at right angles into the lower glacier. And the walls of the  lower glacier sweep around and rise to form the walls of the upper  glacier, and ultimately the summits of the mountain. To reach the peaks  one must first reach the upper glacier, and the southern or left-hand  wall of the lower glacier, where it breaks down into the ridge that  encloses the head of the glacier, is the only possible means by which  the upper basin may be reached. This ridge, then, called by Parker and  Browne the Northeast Ridge (and we have kept that designation, though  with some doubt as to its correctness), presented itself as the next  stage in our climb.    [Sidenote: Last Year's Earthquake]    Now just before leaving Fairbanks we had received a copy of a magazine  containing the account of the Parker-Browne climb, and in that narrative  Mr. Browne speaks of this Northeast Ridge as \"a steep but practicable  snow slope,\" and prints a photograph which shows it as such. To our  surprise, when we first reached the head of the glacier, the ridge  offered no resemblance whatever to the description or the photograph.  The upper one-third of it was indeed as described, but at that point  there was a sudden sharp cleavage, and all below was a jumbled mass of  blocks of ice and rock in all manner of positions, with here a pinnacle  and there a great gap. Moreover, the floor of the glacier at its head  was strewn with enormous icebergs that we could not understand at all.  All at once the explanation came to us--\"the earthquake\"! The  Parker-Browne party had reported an earthquake which shook the whole  base of the mountain on 6th July, 1912, two days after they had come  down, and, as was learned later, the seismographic instruments at  Washington recorded it as the most severe shock since the San Francisco  disturbance of 1906. There could be no doubt that the earthquake had  disrupted this ridge. The huge bergs all around us were not the normal  discharge of hanging glaciers as we had at first wonderingly supposed;  they were the incrustation of ages, maybe, ripped off the rocks and  hurled down from the ridge by this convulsion. It was as though, as soon  as the Parker-Browne party reached the foot of the mountain, the ladder  by which they had ascended and descended was broken up.    [Illustration: The Northeast Ridge shattered by the earthquake in July,  1912.    The earthquake cleavage is plainly shown half-way down the ridge in the  background. The Browne Tower is the uppermost point in the picture. The  Parker Pass is along its base.]    What a wonderful providential escape these three men, Parker, Browne,  and La Voy had! They reached a spot within three or four hundred feet of  the top of the mountain, struggling gallantly against a blizzard, but  were compelled at last to beat a retreat. Again from their  seventeen-thousand-foot camp they essayed it, only to be enshrouded and  defeated by dense mist. They would have waited in their camp for fair  weather had they been provided with food, but their stomachs would not  retain the canned pemmican they had carried laboriously aloft, and they  were compelled to give up the attempt and descend. So down to the foot  of the mountain they went, and immediately they reached their base camp  this awful earthquake shattered the ridge and showered down bergs on  both the upper and lower glaciers. Had their food served they had  certainly remained above, and had they remained above their bodies would  be there now. Even could they have escaped the avalanching icebergs they  could never have descended that ridge after the earthquake. They would  either have been overwhelmed and crushed to death instantly or have  perished by starvation. One cannot conceive grander burial than that  which lofty mountains bend and crack and shatter to make, or a nobler  tomb than the great upper basin of Denali; but life is sweet and all men  are loath to leave it, and certainly never men who cling to life had  more cause to be thankful.    The difficulty of our task was very greatly increased; that was plain at  a glance. This ridge, that the pioneer climbers of 1910 went up at one  march with climbing-irons strapped beneath their moccasins, carrying  nothing but their flagpole, that the Parker-Browne party surmounted in a  few days, relaying their camping stuff and supplies, was to occupy us  for three weeks while we hewed a staircase three miles long in the  shattered ice.    [Sidenote: Glacier Movement]    It was the realization of the earthquake and of what it had done that  convinced us that this Muldrow Glacier has a very slow rate of movement.  The great blocks of ice hurled down from above lay apparently just where  they had fallen almost a year before. At the points of sharp descent, at  the turns in its course, at the points where tributary glaciers were  received, the movement is somewhat more rapid. We saw some crevasses  upon our descent that were not in existence when we went up. But for the  whole stretch of it we were satisfied that a very few feet a year would  cover its movement. No doubt all the glaciers on this side of the range  are much more sluggish than on the other side, where the great  precipitation of snow takes place.    We told Johnny to look for us in two weeks. It was thirty-one days ere  we rejoined him. For now began the period of suspense, of hope blasted  anew nearly every morning, the period of weary waiting for decent  weather. With the whole mountain and glacier enveloped in thick mist it  was not possible to do anything up above, and day after day this was the  condition, varied by high wind and heavy snow. From the inexhaustible  cisterns of the Pacific Ocean that vapor was distilled, and ever it rose  to these mountains and poured all over them until every valley, every  glacier, every hollow, was filled to overflowing. There seemed sometimes  to us no reason why the process should not go on forever. The situation  was not without its ludicrous side, when one had the grace to see it.  Here were four men who had already passed through the long Alaskan  winter, and now, when the rivers were breaking and the trees bursting  into leaf, the flowers spangling every hillside, they were deliberately  pushing themselves up into the winter still, with the long-expected  summer but a day's march away.    The tedium of lying in that camp while snow-storm or fierce, high wind  forbade adventure upon the splintered ridge was not so great to the  writer as to some of the other members of the expedition, for there was  always Walter's education to be prosecuted, as it had been prosecuted  for three winters on the trail and three summers on the launch, in a  desultory but not altogether unsuccessful manner. An hour or two spent  in writing from dictation, another hour or two in reading aloud, a  little geography and a little history and a little physics made the day  pass busily. A pupil is a great resource. Karstens was continually  designing and redesigning a motor-boat in which one engine should  satisfactorily operate twin screws; Tatum learned the thirty-nine  articles by heart; but naval architecture and even controversial  divinity palled after a while. The equipment and the supplies for the  higher region were gone over again and again, to see that all was  properly packed and in due proportion.

Five  pairs of eyes were smouldering with a long-nursed resentment. Five  brows were corrugated with wrathful lines. Such, however, was the  simple majesty of Psmith's demeanour that for a moment there was  dead silence. Not a word was spoken as he paced, wrapped in  thought, to the editorial chair. Stillness brooded over the room as  he carefully dusted that piece of furniture, and, having done so to  his satisfaction, hitched up the knees of his trousers and sank  gracefully into a sitting position.    This accomplished, he looked up and started. He gazed round the  room.    \"Ha! I am observed!\" he murmured.    The words broke the spell. Instantly, the five visitors burst  simultaneously into speech.    \"Are you the acting editor of this paper?\"    \"I wish to have a word with you, sir.\"    \"Mr. Windsor, I presume?\"    \"Pardon me!\"    \"I should like a few moments' conversation.\"    The start was good and even; but the gentleman who said \"Pardon  me!\" necessarily finished first with the rest nowhere.    Psmith turned to him, bowed, and fixed him with a benevolent gaze  through his eye-glass.    \"Are you Mr. Windsor, sir, may I ask?\" inquired the favoured one.    The others paused for the reply.    \"Alas! no,\" said Psmith with manly regret.    \"Then who are you?\"    \"I am Psmith.\"    There was a pause.    \"Where is Mr. Windsor?\"    \"He is, I fancy, champing about forty cents' worth of lunch at some  neighbouring hostelry.\"    \"When will he return?\"    \"Anon. But how much anon I fear I cannot say.\"    The visitors looked at each other.    \"This is exceedingly annoying,\" said the man who had said \"Pardon  me!\" \"I came for the express purpose of seeing Mr. Windsor.\"    \"So did I,\" chimed in the rest. \"Same here. So did I.\"    Psmith bowed courteously.    \"Comrade Windsor's loss is my gain. Is there anything I can do for  you?\"    \"Are you on the editorial staff of this paper?\"    \"I am acting sub-editor. The work is not light,\" added Psmith  gratuitously. \"Sometimes the cry goes round, 'Can Psmith get  through it all? Will his strength support his unquenchable spirit?'  But I stagger on. I do not repine.\"    \"Then maybe you can tell me what all this means?\" said a small  round gentleman who so far had done only chorus work.    \"If it is in my power to do so, it shall be done, Comrade--I have  not the pleasure of your name.\"    \"My name is Waterman, sir. I am here on behalf of my wife, whose  name you doubtless know.\"    \"Correct me if I am wrong,\" said Psmith, \"but I should say it,  also, was Waterman.\"    \"Luella Granville Waterman, sir,\" said the little man proudly.  Psmith removed his eye-glass, polished it, and replaced it in his  eye. He felt that he must run no risk of not seeing clearly the  husband of one who, in his opinion, stood alone in literary circles  as a purveyor of sheer bilge.    \"My wife,\" continued the little man, producing an envelope  and handing it to Psmith, \"has received this extraordinary  communication from a man signing himself W. Windsor. We are  both at a loss to make head or tail of it.\"    Psmith was reading the letter.    \"It seems reasonably clear to me,\" he said.    \"It is an outrage. My wife has been a contributor to this journal  from its foundation. Her work has given every satisfaction to Mr.  Wilberfloss. And now, without the slightest warning, comes this  peremptory dismissal from W. Windsor. Who is W. Windsor? Where is  Mr. Wilberfloss?\"    The chorus burst forth. It seemed that that was what they all  wanted to know: Who was W. Windsor? Where was Mr. Wilberfloss?    \"I am the Reverend Edwin T. Philpotts, sir,\" said a cadaverous-looking  man with pale blue eyes and a melancholy face. \"I have  contributed 'Moments of Meditation' to this journal for a very  considerable period of time.\"    \"I have read your page with the keenest interest,\" said Psmith. \"I  may be wrong, but yours seems to me work which the world will not  willingly let die.\"    The Reverend Edwin's frosty face thawed into a bleak smile.    \"And yet,\" continued Psmith, \"I gather that Comrade Windsor, on the  other hand, actually wishes to hurry on its decease. It is these  strange contradictions, these clashings of personal taste, which  make up what we call life. Here we have, on the one hand--\"    A man with a face like a walnut, who had hitherto lurked almost  unseen behind a stout person in a serge suit, bobbed into the open,  and spoke his piece.    \"Where's this fellow Windsor? W. Windsor. That's the man we want  to see. I've been working for this paper without a break, except  when I had the mumps, for four years, and I've reason to know that  my page was as widely read and appreciated as any in New York. And  now up comes this Windsor fellow, if you please, and tells me in so  many words the paper's got no use for me.\"    \"These are life's tragedies,\" murmured Psmith.    \"What's he mean by it? That's what I want to know. And that's what  these gentlemen want to know--See here--\"    \"I am addressing--?\" said Psmith.    \"Asher's my name. B. Henderson Asher. I write 'Moments of Mirth.'\"    A look almost of excitement came into Psmith's face, such a look as  a visitor to a foreign land might wear when confronted with some  great national monument. That he should be privileged to look upon  the author of \"Moments of Mirth\" in the flesh, face to face, was  almost too much.    \"Comrade Asher,\" he said reverently, \"may I shake your hand?\"    The other extended his hand with some suspicion.    \"Your 'Moments of Mirth,'\" said Psmith, shaking it, \"have  frequently reconciled me to the toothache.\"    He reseated himself.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"this is a painful case. The circumstances,  as you will readily admit when you have heard all, are peculiar.  You have asked me where Mr. Wilberfloss is. I do not know.\"    \"You don't know!\" exclaimed Mr. Waterman.    \"I don't know. You don't know. They,\" said Psmith, indicating the  rest with a wave of the hand, \"don't know. Nobody knows. His  locality is as hard to ascertain as that of a black cat in a  coal-cellar on a moonless night. Shortly before I joined this  journal, Mr. Wilberfloss, by his doctor's orders, started out on a  holiday, leaving no address. No letters were to be forwarded. He  was to enjoy complete rest. Where is he now? Who shall say?  Possibly legging it down some rugged slope in the Rockies, with two  bears and a wild cat in earnest pursuit. Possibly in the midst of  some Florida everglade, making a noise like a piece of meat in  order to snare crocodiles. Possibly in Canada, baiting moose-traps.  We have no data.\"    Silent consternation prevailed among the audience. Finally the Rev.  Edwin T. Philpotts was struck with an idea.    \"Where is Mr. White?\" he asked.    The point was well received.    \"Yes, where's Mr. Benjamin White?\" chorused the rest.    Psmith shook his head.    \"In Europe. I cannot say more.\"    The audience's consternation deepened.    \"Then, do you mean to say,\" demanded Mr. Asher, \"that this fellow  Windsor's the boss here, that what he says goes?\"    Psmith bowed.    \"With your customary clear-headedness, Comrade Asher, you have got  home on the bull's-eye first pop. Comrade Windsor is indeed the  boss. A man of intensely masterful character, he will brook no  opposition. I am powerless to sway him. Suggestions from myself as  to the conduct of the paper would infuriate him. He believes that  radical changes are necessary in the programme of _Cosy Moments_, and  he means to put them through if it snows. Doubtless he would gladly  consider your work if it fitted in with his ideas. A snappy account  of a glove-fight, a spine-shaking word-picture of a railway smash,  or something on those lines, would be welcomed. But--\"    \"I have never heard of such a thing,\" said Mr. Waterman indignantly.    Psmith sighed.    \"Some time ago,\" he said, \"--how long it seems!--I remember saying  to a young friend of mine of the name of Spiller, 'Comrade Spiller,  never confuse the unusual with the impossible.' It is my guiding  rule in life. It is unusual for the substitute-editor of a weekly  paper to do a Captain Kidd act and take entire command of the  journal on his own account; but is it impossible? Alas no. Comrade  Windsor has done it. That is where you, Comrade Asher, and you,  gentlemen, have landed yourselves squarely in the broth. You have  confused the unusual with the impossible.\"    \"But what is to be done?\" cried Mr. Asher.    \"I fear that there is nothing to be done, except wait. The present  _regime_ is but an experiment. It may be that when Comrade  Wilberfloss, having dodged the bears and eluded the wild cat,  returns to his post at the helm of this journal, he may decide not  to continue on the lines at present mapped out. He should be back  in about ten weeks.\"    \"Ten weeks!\"    \"I fancy that was to be the duration of his holiday. Till then my  advice to you gentlemen is to wait. You may rely on me to keep a  watchful eye upon your interests. When your thoughts tend to take a  gloomy turn, say to yourselves, 'All is well. Psmith is keeping a  watchful eye upon our interests.'\"    \"All the same, I should like to see this W. Windsor,\" said Mr.  Asher.    Psmith shook his head.    \"I shouldn't,\" he said. \"I speak in your best interests. Comrade  Windsor is a man of the fiercest passions. He cannot brook  interference. Were you to question the wisdom of his plans, there  is no knowing what might not happen. He would be the first to  regret any violent action, when once he had cooled off, but would  that be any consolation to his victim? I think not. Of course, if  you wish it, I could arrange a meeting--\"    Mr. Asher said no, he thought it didn't matter.    \"I guess I can wait,\" he said.    \"That,\" said Psmith approvingly, \"is the right spirit. Wait. That  is the watch-word. And now,\" he"]]]
