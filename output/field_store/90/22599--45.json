Venizelos argued that the outcome would be  a reconstructed League of the Balkan States which would not only ensure  them against defeat, but would materially contribute to the victory of  the Entente Powers: even the ideal of a lasting Balkan Federation might  be realized by a racial readjustment through an interchange of  populations.  Should Bulgarian greed prove impervious, Greece must secure  the co-operation of Rumania, without which it would be too risky for her  to move.[4]    Sacrifices of territory, in King Constantine's opinion, were out of the  question; but he thought that, if Rumania agreed to co-operate, it might  be possible for Greece to go to Servia's assistance, as in that case  Bulgaria could perhaps be held in check by Rumanian and Greek forces left  along her northern and southern frontiers.  The Bucharest Government was  accordingly sounded, and returned an answer too evasive to justify  reliance on its co-operation.  So M. Venizelos fell back on the scheme of  buying Bulgarian co-operation by the cession of Cavalla, and submitted a  second memorandum to the King.    If the first of these documents was remarkable for its optimism, the  second might justly be described as a {25} masterpiece of faith pure and  undefiled by any contact with sordid facts.  Its theme is the magnitude  of the compensations which Greece might expect in return for her entry  into the War: \"I have a feeling,\" says the author, \"that the concessions  in Asia Minor suggested by Sir Edward Grey can, especially if we submit  to sacrifices to the Bulgars, assume such dimensions as to double the  size of Greece.  I believe that if we demanded\"--he specifies in detail a  vast portion of Western Asia Minor--\"our demand would probably be  granted.\"  He calculated that the surface of this territory exceeds  125,000 (the figure was soon raised to 140,000) square kilometres, while  the area to be ceded in Macedonia did not exceed 2,000 square kilometres,  and that loss would be further halved by the acquisition from Servia of  the Doiran-Ghevgheli district, which covered some 1,000 square  kilometres.  Thus, in point of territory, Greece would be giving up a  hundred and fortieth part of what she would be getting.  In point of  population also Greece would be receiving twenty-five times as much as  she would be sacrificing--an accretion of 800,000 as against a loss of  30,000 souls; and that loss could be obviated by obliging Bulgaria to buy  up the property of the Cavalla Greeks, who, he had no doubt, would gladly  emigrate _en masse_ to Asia Minor, to reinforce the Greek element there.  How was it possible to hesitate about seizing such an opportunity--an  opportunity for the creation of a Greece powerful on land and supreme in  the Aegean Sea--\"an opportunity verily presented to us by Divine  Providence for the realization of our most audacious national  ideals\"--presented to-day and never likely to occur again?    M. Venizelos did not doubt but that a transaction which appeared so  desirable and feasible to him must appear equally desirable and feasible  to others: and great was his surprise to find that such was by no means  the case.  The General Staff, he complained, \"seem, strangely, not  attracted strongly by these views.\"  And the same might be said of  everyone who judged, not by the glow of prophetic insight, but by a cold  examination of facts.  When Asia Minor was first mentioned to the Greek  Minister in London, that shrewd diplomat answered:  \"Greece would not  commit such a folly, for the day she set foot in {26} Asia Minor she  would find herself up against Great Powers as well as against Turkey.\"  [5]  At Athens to this objection were added others not less weighty.  The  General Staff pointed out that Greece had neither the men nor the money  required for the permanent occupation and efficient administration of  that distant region.  They feared both the difficulties of defending  those Turkish territories in Asia and the danger of future attack from  Bulgaria in Europe.  In short, they held that Greece by embarking on what  they aptly termed a Colonial policy would be undertaking responsibilities  wholly incommensurate with her resources.[6]    Dangers and difficulties! cried M. Venizelos: can you allow such things  to stand in the way of national ideals?  And he proceeded to demolish the  obstructions: the administrative success achieved in Macedonia proved  that the resources of Greece were equal to fresh responsibilities; the  Turks of Asia Minor--after the total disappearance of the Ottoman Empire,  which he deemed inevitable--would become contented and law-abiding Greek  subjects, and at all events the local Greek population would in a very  short space of time supply all the forces needed to maintain order in  Asia, leaving the main Greek army free for the defence of the European  frontiers.  During that brief period of transition, he thought it easy to  form an agreement with the Entente Powers for military assistance against  a Bulgarian attack, or, even without the Entente, \"should the Bulgars be  so demented by the Lord as to attempt aggression, I have not the  slightest doubt that Servia, moved by her treaty obligations, her  interests, and her gratitude for our present aid, would again co-operate  with us to humble Bulgarian insolence.\" [7]    Thus at a moment's notice M. Venizelos became an impassioned advocate of  the policy of which he had hitherto been an impassioned opponent, and he  would have us believe that the King, persuaded by his eloquence,  authorised him to carry out his new plan.  Be that as it may, M.  Venizelos did not avail himself of this permission.  {27} For almost  simultaneously came the news of a Bulgarian loan contracted in the  Austro-German market--an event which made him abandon all hopes of  conciliating Bulgaria and profiting by the British overture.  During the  months when the revival of the Balkan League was perhaps still  practicable, he had combated the only expedient which might have given it  a chance of realization: by the time he became a convert, it was too late.    The Balkan situation remained as it was before Sir Edward Grey's  suggestion: so much so that, when a few days later the Entente Powers  again asked Greece to go to Servia's relief, offering her as security  against the Bulgarian danger to transport to Macedonia a French and a  British division, M. Venizelos, considering such security insufficient,  again refused;[8] a refusal which, justified though it was, gave great  umbrage.[9]    While the Greek Premier was going through these mental evolutions, the  scene of Entente activity shifted: and his flexible mind perforce veered  in a new direction.    As far back as 3 November, the outer forts of the Dardanelles had been  subjected to a brief bombardment with the object of testing the range of  their guns; and by 25 November the idea of a serious attack on the  Straits had engaged the attention of the British War Council.  But no  decision was arrived at until January, when Russia, hard pressed by the  Turks on the Caucasus, begged for a demonstration against them in some  other quarter.  In compliance with this appeal, the British War Council  then decided to attempt to force the Dardanelles by means of the Navy  alone.  After the failure of the naval attack of 19 February, however, it  was realized that the operations would have to be supplemented by  military action;[10] and as the magnitude of the enterprise became  clearer and the troops at the disposal of England and France were very  limited, the need of securing Balkan allies became more obvious.    From the first greater importance was attached to Bulgarian co-operation  than to Greek.  Even the grant of {28} a loan to Sofia by the Central  Powers appears to have produced little or no impression upon those  concerned.  Long afterwards it was admitted as a self-evident proposition  that belligerents do not lend to neutrals without being satisfied that  their money will not be used against themselves.  But at the time, after  a momentary shock, the Entente Governments were deluded, either by  Bulgarian diplomacy or by their own wishes, into the belief that  \"Bulgaria would not commit the stupidity to refuse the advantages  offered.\" [11]  Nor, in thus reckoning on enlightened bad faith, were  they alone.  M. Venizelos, who a moment before had declared that the loan  had opened his eyes to the fact \"that Bulgaria was definitely committed  to the Central Powers,\" now felt quite sure that, \"notwithstanding the  loan, Bulgaria was capable of betraying her then friends and turning  towards those who promised her greater profits.\" [12]  Anxious,  therefore, to forestall the Bulgars, and concerned by the thought that he  had been obliged on three occasions to decline requests from the Entente,  he spontaneously proposed, on 1 March, to offer three Greek divisions for  the Dardanelles expedition, stating that this proposal was made with King  Constantine's assent.[13]    As a matter of fact, neither the King nor his General Staff approved of  M. Venizelos's strategy.  Having made a systematic study of the  Dardanelles problem, they judged that the Allies' enterprise, even under  the most skilful handling, presented but few chances, and those chances  had been discounted in advance by utter want of skilful handling: the  bombardment of the Straits in the previous November had given the Turks  warning of the blow and ample time to prepare against it--and the Turks  were no longer the happy-go-lucky fellows upon whose inefficiency one  might formerly have counted; they now mounted guard over the gates of  their capital equipped with German guns and commanded by German officers.  The enterprise was likely to become more hazardous still by arousing the  jealousy of the Bulgars.  If, therefore, Greece did join in, besides all  the other risks,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22690"],[0,"Rembrandt and His Works (#7)"],[1,"still clung to as means of contrast with the  human figure. In one of the sketches by the late Sir D. Wilkie for his  picture of \"Finding the Body of Tippoo Saib,\" he had introduced two  dogs, and only obliterated them when informed that dogs were considered  unclean by the people of the east, and therefore it was an impossibility  for them to be in the palace of Seringapatam. While I am upon this  subject, it may not be amiss to refer to one of the authorities who  censures this practice. Fresnoy says, in his poem on the \"Art of  Painting,\"      \"Nec quod inane, nihil facit ad rem sive videtur     Improprium minimeque urgens potiora tenebit     Ornamenta operis.\"      \"Nor paint conspicuous on the foremost plain,     Whate'er is false, impertinent, or vain.\"       MASON.      [Illustration: CHRIST AND HIS DISCIPLES AT EMMAUS]    On this rule, Reynolds remarks--\"This precept, so obvious to common  sense, appears superfluous till we recollect that some of the greatest  painters have been guilty of a breach of it; for--not to mention Paul  Veronese or Rubens, whose principles as ornamental painters would allow  great latitude in introducing animals, or whatever they might think  necessary to contrast or make the composition more picturesque--we can  no longer wonder why the poet has thought it worth setting a guard  against this impropriety, when we find that such men as Raffaelle and  the Caracci, in their greatest and most serious works, have introduced  on the foreground mean and frivolous circumstances. Such improprieties,  to do justice to the more modern painters, are seldom found in their  works. The only excuse that can be made for those great artists, is  their living in an age when it was the custom to mix the ludicrous with  the serious, and when poetry as well as painting gave in to this  fashion.\"    Many of the compositions of Rembrandt indicate not only a refined  taste, but the greatest sensibility and feeling. For example, the small  etchings of the \"Burial of Christ,\" and the \"Return from Jerusalem;\"  these, from their slightness, may lay me under the same category as the  old Greek, who, having a house to sell, carried in his pocket one of the  bricks as a sample; yet, being his own indications, I have given them.  It is worth while to compare the \"Entombment\" with the same subject by  Raffaelle, in the Crozat Collection. The whole arrangement is treated in  the finest taste of the Italian school. The other design has been always  a favourite with the admirers of Rembrandt. The feeling character of the  youthful Saviour is admirably portrayed. Holding his mother's hand, he  is cheering her on her tiring journey, looking in her face with an  expression of affection and solace; while she is represented with  downcast eyes, fatigued and \"pondering in her mind\" the import of the  words he had addressed to her, \"How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not  that I must be about my Father's business?\" And even here we can almost  excuse the introduction of the little dog, who, running before the  group, is looking back, giving a bark of joy at their having found the  object of their solicitude. The background is conceived in the finest  spirit of Titian.    These are the touches of nature that, like the expressions of our own  immortal Shakspere, however slight, and though dressed in modern garb or  familiar language, reach the innermost sensibilities of the human heart.    [Illustration: THE ENTOMBMENT]    [Illustration: THE RETURN FROM JERUSALEM]    The character and costume of the people, as well as the scenery of those  subjects taken from Holy Writ, have been a matter of investigation both  by artists and writers upon art; for although the events related in the  New Testament are not of so ancient a date as those of the heathen  writers, yet the mind seems to require that the style should be neither  classic nor too strictly local. Hence, though the costume represented in  the Venetian pictures is no doubt nearer the truth than that made use of  by Raffaelle and other Italians, it fails to carry us back to ancient  and primitive simplicity. The early pictures delineating Christian  subjects are modelled upon Greek forms and dresses, and having been  made the foundation of those works afterwards produced by the great  restorers of painting, have gained a hold upon our ideas, which, if not  impossible, is yet difficult to throw off. As the late Sir David Wilkie  travelled into the East with the express purpose of painting the  subjects mentioned in Scripture in more strict accordance with the  people and their habits, it may be of advantage to give the student his  opinions. In his Journal, he says--\"After seeing with great attention  the city of Jerusalem and the district of Syria that extends from Jaffa  to the river Jordan, I am satisfied it still presents a new field for  the genius of Scripture painting to work upon. It is true the great  Italian painters have created an art, the highest of its kind, peculiar  to the subjects of sacred history; and in some of their examples,  whether from facility of inquiry or from imagination, have come very  near all the view of Syria could supply. The Venetians, (perhaps  from their intercourse with Cyprus and the Levant,) Titian, Paul  Veronese, and Sebastian del Piombo, have in their pictures given  the nearest appearance to a Syrian people. Michael Angelo, too, from  his generalizing style, has brought some of his prophets and sybils  to resemble the old Jews about the streets of the Holy City; but in  general, though the aspect of Nature will sometimes recall the finest  ideas of Leonardo da Vinci and Raffaelle, yet these masters still want  much that could be supplied here, and have a great deal of matters quite  contrary to what the country could furnish. These contrarieties, indeed,  are so great, that in discussions with the learned here, I find a  disposition to that kind of change that would soon set aside the whole  system of Italian and European art; but as these changes go too much  upon the supposition that the manners of Scripture are precisely  represented by the present race in Syria, it is too sweeping to be borne  out by what we actually know. At the same time, there are so many  objects in this country so perfectly described, so incapable of change,  and that give such an air of truth to the local allusions of Sacred  Writ, that one can scarcely imagine that these, had they been known to  the painters of Italy, would not have added to the impressive power of  their works. Without trying to take from the grand impression produced  by the reading of the Sacred Writings, it may be said that from its  nature many things must be confined to narrative, to description, to  precept--and these are no doubt so strong as to supply to a pious mind  everything that can be desired; but if these are to be represented, as  certainly they have been, by those of an art who have not seen Syria, it  is clear some other country, Italy, Spain, or Flanders, will be drawn  upon to supply this, and the reader of Scripture and the admirer of art  will be alike deluded by the representation of a strange country in the  place of that so selected and so identified as the Land of Promise--so  well known and so graphically described from the first to the last of  the inspired writers.\"    These remarks are certainly applicable, but only in a degree. What  is quoted from Reynolds, in a former part, shows that a licence is  indispensable; and yet, without destroying the apparent truth of the  subject, many things are now established that, without their being  facts, have taken such hold of our ideas that they cannot with safety be  departed from. I may instance the countenances of our Saviour and the  Virgin, as given by Raffaelle and Coreggio--we recognise them as if they  had been painted from the persons themselves; I may also add the heads  of the Apostles. With regard to the scenery, many circumstances may  certainly be taken advantage of, always guarding against a topographical  appearance that, by its locality, may prevent the work leading the  spectator back into distant periods of time. Before quitting this part  of the subject, which refers to Rembrandt's powers of composition, I may  notice one or two of his designs, which stamp him as a great genius in  this department of the art--viz., his \"Christ Healing the Sick,\" \"Haman  and Mordecai,\" the \"Ecce Homo,\" \"Christ Preaching,\" and the \"Death of  the Virgin.\"          CHIARO-SCURO.      From the position we are now placed in, surrounded by the accumulated  talent of many centuries, it is easy to take a retrospective view of  the progress of art; and it is only by so doing that we can arrive at  a just estimate of the great artists who advanced it beyond the age  in which they lived, and this seems mainly to have been achieved by  a close observance of nature. As in philosophy the genius of Bacon,  by investigating the phenomena of visible objects, put to flight  and dissipated the learned dogmas of the school of Aristotle, so in  sculpture the purity and simplicity of the forms of Phidias established  a line of demarcation between his own works and those of the formal,  symmetrical, and dry sculpture of his predecessors. Sculpture, till  then, lay fettered and bound up in the severity of Egyptian  Hieroglyphics. Likewise we perceive the genius of Michael Angelo and  Raffaelle setting aside the stiffness and profile character existing  in the works of Signorelli and Masaccio. In Venice, Titian emancipated  the arts from the grasp of Giovanni Bellini. In Germany, Rubens must  be considered the great translator of art out of a dead language into  a living one, to use a metaphor, and into one that, like music, is  universal. Previous to Rembrandt, the pupils of Rubens had thrown off  every affinity not only to Gothic stiffness, but even to that degree  of regularity of composition which all classes of"]]]
