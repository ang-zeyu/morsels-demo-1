There is yet another which completes and crowns the  character,--constancy of purpose; and it is only in considering his  course as a whole, that we see how harmonious and consistent have been  that life and its labours, which, in a partial and brief view, might be  supposed to have been somewhat desultory and fragmentary.    On his moral character I shall scarcely presume to dwell. The  philosophic sweetness of his disposition, the serenity of his lot, and  the elevating nature of his pursuits, combined to enable him to pass  through life without an evil act, almost without an evil thought. As the  world has always been fond of personal details respecting men who have  been celebrated, I will mention that he was fair, with a Bourbon nose,  and brown eyes of extraordinary beauty and lustre. He wore a small black  velvet cap, but his white hair latterly touched his shoulders in curls  almost as flowing as in his boyhood. His extremities were delicate and  well-formed, and his leg, at his last hour, as shapely as in his youth,  which showed the vigour of his frame. Latterly he had become corpulent.  He did not excel in conversation, though in his domestic circle he was  garrulous. Everything interested him; and blind, and eighty-two, he was  still as susceptible as a child. One of his last acts was to compose  some verses of gay gratitude to his daughter-in-law, who was his London  correspondent, and to whose lively pen his last years were indebted for  constant amusement. He had by nature a singular volatility which never  deserted him. His feelings, though always amiable, were not painfully  deep, and amid joy or sorrow, the philosophic vein was ever evident. He  more resembled Goldsmith than any man that I can compare him to: in his  conversation, his apparent confusion of ideas ending with some  felicitous phrase of genius, his naivete, his simplicity not untouched  with a dash of sarcasm affecting innocence--one was often reminded of  the gifted and interesting friend of Burke and Johnson. There was,  however, one trait in which my father did not resemble Goldsmith: he had  no vanity. Indeed, one of his few infirmities was rather a deficiency of  self-esteem.    On the whole, I hope--nay I believe--that taking all into  consideration--the integrity and completeness of his existence, the fact  that, for sixty years, he largely contributed to form the taste, charm  the leisure, and direct the studious dispositions, of the great body of  the public, and that his works have extensively and curiously  illustrated the literary and political history of our country, it will  be conceded, that in his life and labours, he repaid England for the  protection and the hospitality which this country accorded to his father  a century ago.

Of a work which long has been placed on that shelf which Voltaire has  discriminated as _la Bibliotheque du Monde_, it is never mistimed for  the author to offer the many, who are familiar with its pages, a settled  conception of its design.    The \"Curiosities of Literature,\" commenced fifty years since, have been  composed at various periods, and necessarily partake of those successive  characters which mark the eras of the intellectual habits of the writer.    In my youth, the taste for modern literary history was only of recent  date. The first elegant scholar who opened a richer vein in the mine of  MODERN LITERATURE was JOSEPH WARTON;--he had a fragmentary mind, and he  was a rambler in discursive criticism. Dr. JOHNSON was a famished man  for anecdotical literature, and sorely complained of the penury of our  literary history.    THOMAS WARTON must have found, in the taste of his brother and the  energy of Johnson, his happiest prototypes; but he had too frequently to  wrestle with barren antiquarianism, and was lost to us at the gates of  that paradise which had hardly opened on him. These were the true  founders of that more elegant literature in which France had preceded  us. These works created a more pleasing species of erudition:--the age  of taste and genius had come; but the age of philosophical thinking was  yet but in its dawn.    Among my earliest literary friends, two distinguished themselves by  their anecdotical literature: JAMES PETIT ANDREWS, by his \"Anecdotes,  Ancient and Modern,\" and WILLIAM SEWARD, by his \"Anecdotes of  Distinguished Persons.\" These volumes were favourably received, and to  such a degree, that a wit of that day, and who is still a wit as well as  a poet, considered that we were far gone in our \"Anecdotage.\"    I was a guest at the banquet, but it seemed to me to consist wholly of  confectionery. I conceived the idea of a collection of a different  complexion. I was then seeking for instruction in modern literature; and  our language afforded no collection of the _res litterariae_. In the  diversified volumes of the French _Ana_, I found, among the best,  materials to work on. I improved my subjects with as much of our own  literature as my limited studies afforded. The volume, without a name,  was left to its own unprotected condition. I had not miscalculated the  wants of others by my own.    This first volume had reminded the learned of much which it is grateful  to remember, and those who were restricted by their classical studies,  or lounged only in perishable novelties, were in modern literature but  dry wells, for which I had opened clear waters from a fresh spring. The  work had effected its design in stimulating the literary curiosity of  those, who, with a taste for its tranquil pursuits, are impeded in their  acquirement. Imitations were numerous. My reading became more various,  and the second volume of \"Curiosities of Literature\" appeared, with a  slight effort at more original investigation. The two brother volumes  remained favourites during an interval of twenty years.    It was as late as 1817 that I sent forth the third volume; without a  word of preface. I had no longer anxieties to conceal or promises to  perform. The subjects chosen were novel, and investigated with more  original composition. The motto prefixed to this third volume from the  Marquis of Halifax is lost in the republications, but expresses the  peculiar delight of all literary researches for those who love them:  \"The struggling for knowledge hath a pleasure in it like that of  wrestling with a fine woman.\"    The notice which the third volume obtained, returned me to the dream of  my youth. I considered that essay writing, from Addison to the  successors of Johnson, which had formed one of the most original  features of our national literature, would now fail in its attraction,  even if some of those elegant writers themselves had appeared in a form  which their own excellence had rendered familiar and deprived of all  novelty. I was struck by an observation which Johnson has thrown out.  That sage, himself an essayist and who had lived among our essayists,  fancied that \"mankind may come in time to write all aphoristically;\" and  so athirst was that first of our great moral biographers for the details  of human life and the incidental characteristics of individuals, that he  was desirous of obtaining anecdotes without preparation or connexion.  \"If a man,\" said this lover of literary anecdotes, \"is to wait till he  weaves anecdotes, we may be long in getting them, and get but few in  comparison to what we might get.\" Another observation, of Lord  Bolingbroke, had long dwelt in my mind, that \"when examples are pointed  out to us, there is a kind of appeal with which we are flattered made to  our senses as well as our understandings.\" An induction from a variety  of particulars seemed to me to combine that delight, which Johnson  derived from anecdotes, with that philosophy which Bolingbroke founded  on examples; and on this principle the last three volumes of the  \"Curiosities of Literature\" were constructed, freed from the formality  of dissertation, and the vagueness of the lighter essay.    These \"Curiosities of Literature\" have passed through a remarkable  ordeal of time; they have survived a generation of rivals; they are  found wherever books are bought, and they have been repeatedly reprinted  at foreign presses, as well as translated.

Emma Goldman is a similar personality.  She is a  strong factor in the socio-political life of America.  By virtue of  her eloquence, energy, and brilliant mentality, she moulds the minds  and hearts of thousands of her auditors.    Deep sympathy and compassion for suffering humanity, and an  inexorable honesty toward herself, are the leading traits of Emma  Goldman.  No person, whether friend or foe, shall presume to control  her goal or dictate her mode of life.  She would perish rather than  sacrifice her convictions, or the right of self-ownership of soul and  body.  Respectability could easily forgive the teaching of theoretic  Anarchism; but Emma Goldman does not merely preach the new  philosophy; she also persists in living it,--and that is the one  supreme, unforgivable crime.  Were she, like so many radicals, to  consider her ideal as merely an intellectual ornament; were she to  make concessions to existing society and compromise with old  prejudices,--then even the most radical views could be pardoned in  her.  But that she takes her radicalism seriously; that it has  permeated her blood and marrow to the extent where she not merely  teaches but also practices her convictions--this shocks even the  radical Mrs. Grundy.  Emma Goldman lives her own life; she associates  with publicans--hence the indignation of the Pharisees and Sadducees.    It is no mere coincidence that such divergent writers as Pietro Gori  and William Marion Reedy find similar traits in their  characterization of Emma Goldman.  In a contribution to LA QUESTIONE  SOCIALE, Pietro Gori calls her a \"moral power, a woman who, with the  vision of a sibyl, prophesies the coming of a new kingdom for the  oppressed; a woman who, with logic and deep earnestness, analyses the  ills of society, and portrays, with artist touch, the coming dawn of  humanity, founded on equality, brotherhood, and liberty.\"    William Reedy sees in Emma Goldman the \"daughter of the dream, her  gospel a vision which is the vision of every truly great-souled man  and woman who has ever lived.\"    Cowards who fear the consequences of their deeds have coined the word  of philosophic Anarchism.  Emma Goldman is too sincere, too defiant,  to seek safety behind such paltry pleas.  She is an Anarchist, pure  and simple.  She represents the idea of Anarchism as framed by Josiah  Warrn, Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Tolstoy.  Yet she also  understands the psychologic causes which induce a Caserio, a  Vaillant, a Bresci, a Berkman, or a Czolgosz to commit deeds of  violence.  To the soldier in the social struggle it is a point of  honor to come in conflict with the powers of darkness and tyranny,  and Emma Goldman is proud to count among her best friends and  comrades men and women who bear the wounds and scars received in  battle.    In the words of Voltairine de Cleyre, characterizing Emma Goldman  after the latter's imprisonment in 1893: The spirit that animates  Emma Goldman is the only one which will emancipate the slave from his  slavery, the tyrant from his tyranny--the spirit which is willing to  dare and suffer.    HIPPOLYTE HAVEL.    New York, December, 1910.          PREFACE      Some twenty-one years ago I heard the first great Anarchist  speaker--the inimitable John Most.  It seemed to me then, and for  many years after, that the spoken word hurled forth among the masses  with such wonderful eloquence, such enthusiasm and fire, could never  be erased from the human mind and soul.  How could any one of all the  multitudes who flocked to Most's meetings escape his prophetic voice!  Surely they had but to hear him to throw off their old beliefs, and  see the truth and beauty of Anarchism!    My one great longing then was to be able to speak with the tongue of  John Most,--that I, too, might thus reach the masses.  Oh, for the  naivety of Youth's enthusiasm!  It is the time when the hardest thing  seems but child's play.  It is the only period in life worth while.  Alas!  This period is but of short duration.  Like Spring, the STURM  UND DRANG period of the propagandist brings forth growth, frail and  delicate, to be matured or killed according to its powers of  resistance against a thousand vicissitudes.    My great faith in the wonder worker, the spoken word, is no more.  I  have realized its inadequacy to awaken thought, or even emotion.  Gradually, and with no small struggle against this realization, I  came to see that oral propaganda is at best but a means of shaking  people from their lethargy: it leaves no lasting impression.  The  very fact that most people attend meetings only if aroused by  newspaper sensations, or because they expect to be amused, is proof  that they really have no inner urge to learn.    It is altogether different with the written mode of human expression.  No one, unless intensely interested in progressive ideas, will bother  with serious books.  That leads me to another discovery made after  many years of public activity.  It is this: All claims of education  notwithstanding, the pupil will accept only that which his mind  craves.  Already this truth is recognized by most modern educators in  relation to the immature mind.  I think it is equally true regarding  the adult.  Anarchists or revolutionists can no more be made than  musicians.  All that can be done is to plant the seeds of thought.  Whether something vital will develop depends largely on the fertility  of the human soil, though the quality of the intellectual seed must  not be overlooked.    In meetings the audience is distracted by a thousand non-essentials.  The speaker, though ever so eloquent, cannot escape the restlessness  of the crowd, with the inevitable result that he will fail to strike  root.  In all probability he will not even do justice to himself.    The relation between the writer and the reader is more intimate.  True, books are only what we want them to be; rather, what we read  into them.  That we can do so demonstrates the importance of written  as against oral expression.  It is this certainty which has induced  me to gather in one volume my ideas on various topics of individual  and social importance.  They represent the mental and soul struggles  of twenty-one years,--the conclusions derived after many changes and  inner revisions.    I am not sanguine enough to hope that my readers will be as numerous  as those who have heard me.  But I prefer to reach the few who really  want to learn, rather than the many who come to be amused.    As to the book, it must speak for itself.  Explanatory remarks do but  detract from the ideas set forth.  However, I wish to forestall two  objections which will undoubtedly be raised.  One is in reference to  the essay on ANARCHISM; the other, on MINORITIES VERSUS MAJORITIES.    \"Why do you not say how things will be operated under Anarchism?\" is  a question I have had to meet thousands of times.  Because I believe  that Anarchism can not consistently impose an iron-clad program or  method on the future.  The things every new generation has to fight,  and which it can least overcome, are the burdens of the past, which  holds us all as in a net.  Anarchism, at least as I understand it,  leaves posterity free to develop its own particular systems, in  harmony with its needs.  Our most vivid imagination can not foresee  the potentialities of a race set free from external restraints.  How, then, can any one assume to map out a line of conduct for those  to come?  We, who pay dearly for every breath of pure, fresh air,  must guard against the tendency to fetter the future.  If we succeed  in clearing the soil from the rubbish of the past and present, we  will leave to posterity the greatest and safest heritage of all ages.    The most disheartening tendency common among readers is to tear out  one sentence from a work, as a criterion of the writer's ideas or  personality.  Friedrich Nietzsche, for instance, is decried as a  hater of the weak because he believed in the UEBERMENSCH.  It does  not occur to the shallow interpreters of that giant mind that this  vision of the UEBERMENSCH also called for a state of society which  will not give birth to a race of weaklings and slaves.    It is the same narrow attitude which sees in Max Stirner naught but  the apostle of the theory \"each for himself, the devil take the hind  one.\"  That Stirner's individualism contains the greatest social  possibilities is utterly ignored.  Yet, it is nevertheless true that  if society is ever to become free, it will be so through liberated  individuals, whose free efforts make society.    These examples bring me to the objection that will be raised to  MINORITIES VERSUS MAJORITIES.  No doubt, I shall be excommunicated as  an enemy of the people, because I repudiate the mass as a creative  factor.  I shall prefer that rather than be guilty of the demagogic  platitudes so commonly in vogue as a bait for the people.  I realize  the malady of the oppressed and disinherited masses only too well,  but I refuse to prescribe the usual ridiculous palliatives which  allow the patient neither to die nor to recover.  One cannot be too  extreme in dealing with social ills; besides, the extreme thing is  generally the true thing.  My lack of faith in the majority is  dictated by my faith in the potentialities of the individual.  Only  when the latter becomes free to choose his associates for a common  purpose, can we hope for order and harmony out of this world of chaos  and inequality.    For the rest, my book must speak for itself.    Emma Goldman          ANARCHISM: WHAT IT REALLY STANDS FOR                                 ANARCHY.
