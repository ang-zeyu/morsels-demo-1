He pursued his way in the direction indicated to him all night, and  at break of day he found himself walking between a pair of low hills of  clay which stood close together, and once more he heard behind him the  voices of his enemies and the trampling of their horses. But now his  good friend QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i appeared to him and said to him: \"My grandchild,  are you still here? Have you come only thus far?\" \"I am here,\" cried the  Navajo, \"and oh, my grandfather, I could do no better. Look at my limbs!  See how sore and swollen they are! I am exhausted and feel that I cannot  flee much farther before my enemies.\" \"Go, then,\" said QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i, \"to  that hill which is the farther from us and climb to the top of it; but,  when you are taking the very last step which will place you on the  summit, shut your eyes as you make that step.\" The Navajo hastened to  the hill, and, weary as he was, he soon ascended it. As he lifted his  foot to take the last step he closed his eyes, as the yay had bidden  him. When he felt his foot again on the earth he opened his eyes, and  lo! instead of having a little hill under his feet, he stood on the  summit of a great mountain peak, seamed with deep caÃ±ons, bordered with  rugged rocks, and clothed with great forests of pine and spruce; while  far away on the plain at the foot of the mountain--so far that he could  scarcely discern them--were his baffled pursuers, and beside him stood  QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i. The latter pointed out to him many familiar places in the  distance--the valley of the San Juan, and Dsilyi`-qojÃ²ni (Beautiful in  the Mountains), where he and his people first lived. He rested securely  on the mountain top all day.    39. At sunset he went on his way again. When daylight began to appear he  crossed the San Juan. Soon after, while journeying on over an open  plain, he once more heard the Ute on his trail. He now felt very sad and  hopeless, for his limbs were so stiff and swollen that every motion gave  him pain and he could hardly drag himself along. But at this moment he  became conscious that he was not alone, and glancing to one side he saw  Niltci, the wind god, walking with him. And Niltci brought a great dark  whirlwind, which roared a moment beside them and then buried its point  in the ground and dug a deep hole there; it dug a cavern with four  chambers. Then dark clouds gathered and rain began to fall. \"Have you  anything with you that may help you?\" asked the god. \"I have nothing,\"  said the Navajo, \"but four sprays of spruce, which the YÃ ybichy bade me  pluck from the tree on which I descended into the caÃ±on the night I left  the Ute camp.\" \"They will do,\" said the wind god. \"Make quickly four  balls of mud and thrust through each ball a twig of the spruce, and lay  them on the ground so that the tops of the twigs will point towards your  enemies.\" The Navajo did as he was commanded. Then Niltci blew the twigs  and mud balls in the direction of the pursuers and told the Navajo to  descend into the retreat which the whirlwind had formed. He went down  and rested secure, while he heard overhead great peals of thunder, the  loud rushing of the tempest, and the heavy pattering of enormous  hailstones, to bring which the mud balls had been made. The noises of  the storm died away, and about midday Niltci came into the cave and said  to the man: \"Come forth; your enemies have been dispersed. Many have  been killed by the hail, and the rest have gone towards their homes.\"  Then the Navajo came up out of the ground and set out in the direction  of his old home at Dsilyi`-qojÃ²ni.    40. It was about sunset when he reached the top of the mountain. The  snow began to fall heavily and a strong wind began to blow. He walked on  to the western brow of the mountain, where there was a great precipice.  Here the storm blew with such violence that he could scarcely stand, and  yet the precipice was so steep that he did not see how he could get  down. But soon, as on a former occasion of this kind, he discovered a  spruce tree which grew against the side of the precipice, and at the  same time QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i appeared to him again and directed him to go down  on the spruce tree. He did so, and when he reached the bottom he found  the yay there awaiting him. He addressed QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i: \"Oh, my  grandfather, I am tired and sore and sleepy. I would like to lie down  under this tree and sleep.\" But the god answered, \"Go, my grandchild, to  yonder fire and rest,\" and he pointed to a distant gleam on the side of  a mountain which lay beyond a very deep valley. \"No, my grandfather,\"  cried the Navajo, \"I am weary and my limbs are sore and weak; I can not  travel so far.\" \"I will help you,\" said the yay, and as he spoke he  spanned the valley with a flash of lightning, over which he led the man  to the distant mountain. They reached it at a point close to the fire;  but the moment they stood again on the firm earth QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i and the  fire vanished. The man was bewildered and at a loss what to do. He  walked around the mountain a short distance and then changed his mind  and walked back to the place from which he started. Here he found  QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i awaiting him. The yay spoke not a word, but pointed down into  the valley and led the way thither. At the bottom of the valley they  came to a great hole in the ground; the yay pointed in and again led the  way. As they advanced into the cave the air grew warmer. In a little  while they discovered a bright fire on which there was no wood. Four  pebbles lay on the ground together: a black pebble in the east, a blue  one in the south, a yellow one in the west, and a white one in the  north; from these the flames issued forth. Around the fire lay four  bears, colored and placed to correspond with the pebbles. When the  strangers approached the fire the bears asked them for tobacco, and when  the former replied that they had none the bears became angry and thrice  more demanded it. When the Navajo fled from the Ute camp he had helped  himself from one of the four bags which the council was using and had  taken a pipe, and these he had tied up in his skin robe; so when the  fourth demand was made he filled the pipe and lighted it at the fire. He  handed the pipe to the black bear, who, taking but one whiff, passed it  to the blue bear and immediately fell senseless. The blue bear took two  whiffs and passed the pipe, when he too fell over in a state of  unconsciousness. The yellow bear succumbed after the third whiff, and  the white bear, in the north, after the fourth whiff. Now the Navajo  knocked the ashes and tobacco out of his pipe and rubbed the latter on  the feet, legs, abdomen, chest, shoulders, forehead, and mouth of each  of the bears in turn, and they were at once resuscitated. He replaced  the pipe in the corner of his robe. When the bears recovered they  assigned to the Navajo a place on the east side of the fire where he  might lie all night, and they brought out their stores of corn meal and  tciltcin and other berries and offered them to him to eat; but  QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i warned him not to touch the food and again disappeared. So,  hungry as he was, the Indian lay down supperless to sleep. When he woke  in the morning the bears again offered food, which he again declined,  saying he was not hungry. Then they showed him how to make the bear  kethÃ wns, or sticks to be sacrificed to the bear gods, and they drew  from one corner of the cave a great sheet of cloud, which they unrolled,  and on it were painted the forms of the yays of the cultivated plants.  As he departed the bears said, \"There are others in these parts who have  secrets to tell you. Yonder is TsenÃ¡stci, where many dwell.\" So he set  forth for TsenÃ¡stci (Circle of Red Stones.)    41. As he passed down the valley he heard a loud rushing noise be hind  him, and looking around he beheld a tornado. The air was filled with  logs and uprooted trees, borne along by the great storm. It came nearer  and seemed to be advancing to destroy him. He was terrified and cried  out to the storm: \"CiyÃ¨Ã¯cÃ§e, Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni. QuaÃ¯lÃ¡Ã§i?\" (\"'Tis I, Reared  Within the Mountains. Who art thou?\") The tempest recognized him and  subsided, and in its place appeared four men in the shape of the glÃ²Ã¯ or  weasel. The four weasel men showed him how to make the glÃ²Ã¯-bikeÃ§an, or  sacrificial sticks of the glÃ²Ã¯. What name the Navajo bore before this  time the ancient tale does not tell us; but from the moment he said  these words he was called among the gods Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni, and was  afterwards known by this name among his people.    42. After this adventure he continued on his way to TsenÃ¡stci. He had  not journeyed far when he met the wind god, who said to him: \"Those whom  you will meet at TsenÃ¡stci are evil ones; therefore I will be with you  and will walk before you.\" When they came to TsenÃ¡stci they found a hole  in the rocks guarded by two great rattlesnakes, one on each side, and  covered by two piÃ±on trees, for a door. When the travelers drew near,  the serpents showed signs of great anger, and when the former approached  the door the reptiles shook their rattles violently, thrust out their  tongues, and struck at the intruders as though they would bite them; but  they did not bite. Niltci thrust aside the piÃ±on trees; he and his  companions entered, and, when they had passed within, the piÃ±on trees,  moving of their own accord, closed the entrance behind them. Within they  encountered a bald headed old man who had only a little tuft of hair  over each ear. This was KlictsÃ², the Great Serpent. He asked Niltci who  his human companion was, and the wind god answered that he was a Navajo  who had been captured by the Ute, but had escaped from them and had  suffered many hardships. On hearing this KlictsÃ² showed the Indian how  to make the kethÃ wns, now known to the Navajo shamans as  klictsÃ²-bikeÃ§an, or sacrificial sticks"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20840"],[0,"Rebel Spurs (#7)"],[1,"a hail from the door.    \"You there--Rennie!\"    Drew saw the involuntary spasm of _Don_ Cazar's lips, the shadow of an  expression which might mean he anticipated a distasteful scene to come.  But the quirk disappeared as he turned to face the man in the blue  uniform.    \"Captain Bayliss.\" It was acknowledgment rather than a greeting, delivered  in a cool tone.    \"I want to see you, Rennie!\" The officer stamped forward a step or so, to  stand in the full light of the first lantern. He was of medium height, and  his blue blouse had been cut by a good tailor, though now it was worn. He  was a good-looking man, though jowly about the mouth, above which a  closely cropped mustache bristled. His color was high under a pink skin  which in this hot country must burn painfully. And there was the permanent  stamp of uncertain temper in the lines about his prominent eyes.            4      \"So, you see me, Bayliss,\" _Don_ Cazar returned evenly. \"There is some  trouble?\"    Bartolome shifted from one foot to the other, his spurs ringing. _Don_  Lorenzo's expression was one of withdrawal, but on the round countenance  of the Mexican was open dislike.    The sun-reddened skin flushed darker. \"All right, Rennie!\" the captain  exploded. \"If you want it straight, that's the way you're going to get it!  You've been hiring Rebs again!\"    Once before Drew had seen explosive anger curbed visibly by a man who knew  the folly of losing control over his emotions. It had been on a hilltop  back in Tennessee, with the storm clouds of January overhead. General  Bedford Forrest, watching men driven to the limit by necessity and his own  orders, had looked just that way when he had rounded on Drew, bearing news  of yet another break-through by the Federals. Now it was this Anglo  wearing Spanish dress and standing in a dim stable, reining temper to meet  the open hostility of the captain.    \"Captain Bayliss.\" The words sounded as remote as if the speaker bestrode  some peak of the Chiricahuas to address a pygmy in a canyon below. \"I know  of no law which states that I may not employ whom I choose on my own land.  If a man does his job and makes no trouble, his past does not matter. I am  as ready to fire a former Union soldier as I am a Confederate--\"    \"I tell you again: I'm not going to have Rebs around here passing on  information to Kitchell!\"    \"And _I_ say once again, Captain, that men who ride for me do not in  addition ride for Kitchell.\"    \"_Si_--!\" Bartolome's face was as flushed as Bayliss' now. \"We do not help  those _bandidos_. Do they not also raid us? Two weeks ago Francisco Perez,  his horse comes in with blood on the saddle. We ride out and find  him--shot, dragged with the rope. That is not Apache trick, that, but the  work of Kitchell and his snakes!\"    \"Peace, _amigo_.\" _Don_ Cazar's raised finger silenced his man. \"Bartolome  is right, Bayliss. Kitchell is beginning to nibble at the Range. He has  not many sources of supply left. Soon he will either have to cross the  border to stay or make some reckless raid which will give us a chance at  him.\"    \"These damned Rebs around here will keep him going! You can't tell me they  don't back him every chance they get. And I'm warning you, Rennie, if you  hire any man you can't answer for, he's going to the stockade and you'll  hear about it from the army!\"    \"And you also listen, Captain. I will not be dictated to, and the army had  best understand that. I do not want Kitchell in this country any more than  you do. He has made a boast of being Confederate leading what he terms  Mounted Irregulars. But to my knowledge he never held a commission from  the South, and he is nothing but an outlaw trading on the unsettled state  of the territory. That is recognized by every decent man in Arizona. And  that covers those you call 'Rebels' as well as former Union men.\"    Bayliss was silent for a long second, and then he jerked his hat farther  down on his peeling forehead. \"You've had notice, Rennie, that's all I  have to say. I'm going to clear all the Rebs out of this section. Then we  will be able to get at Kitchell, and the army will settle him for good and  all!\"    \"Bayliss!\" The captain had half turned, but _Don_ Cazar's call halted him.  \"Don't you try harassing any of my riders. They mind their business and  will not make any trouble as long as they are left in peace. If there are  any problems in town, _Don_ Lorenzo Sierra, here, is the alcalde and they  must be referred to him.\"    The captain favored Rennie with a last glare and was gone. Tobe Kells  spoke first.    \"That one's chewin' th' bit an' gittin' ready to hump under th' saddle.  This business of tryin' to run out th' Rebs, it'll cause smokin'!\"    \"He has no right to give such an order,\" _Don_ Cazar was beginning when  the alcalde interrupted:    \"_Compadre_, for a man such as that your talk of rights means nothing. He  is eaten by the need to impress his will here, and that will bring  trouble. I do not like what I have heard, no, I do not like it at all.\"    \"You know what may be really eating at him this time, Hunt?\" Topham spoke  from where he was leaning against the wall of Shadow's box stall. \"Johnny  was throwing his weight around again last night. Had a set-to in the Jacks  with a trooper. Unless the kid quits trying to fight the war over again  every time he sees an army blouse--or until he stops pouring whisky down  him every time he hits town--there may be shooting trouble. There're some  equal hot-heads in Bayliss' camp, and if Johnny goes up against one of  them, a scuffle could become a battle.\"    \"Yeah, an' that warn't all Johnny was doin' last night.\" Kells shifted his  tobacco cud from one cheek to the other. \"Iffen Kirby here hadn't been to  hand, Johnny would have skinned th' Trinfan kid with his quirt--jus' 'cause  he dropped his purse outside th' Jacks an' th' kid followed him to give it  back. Johnny's meaner than a drunk Injun these days. That's Bible-swear  truth, Rennie.\"    \"To lose a war makes a man bitter,\" _Don_ Cazar said slowly. \"Johnny was  far too young when he ran away to join Howard. And after that defeat at  Glorieta, the retreat to Texas was pure hell with the fires roaring. It  seems to have done something to the boy--inside.\"    \"Johnny wasn't the only boy at Glorieta. From what I've heard most of them  weren't old enough to grow a good whisker crop.\" Topham's voice had lost  its detached note. \"And he sure wasn't the only Confederate to surrender.  Hunt, he's got to learn that losing a war doesn't mean that a man has lost  the rest of his life. But the way he's been acting these past months,  Johnny might just lose it. Bayliss' tongue is hanging out a yard or more  he's panting so hard to get back at you. That captain has heady ambitions  under his hat, maybe like setting up here as a tinpot governor or  something like. If he can discredit you, well, he probably thinks he's got  a chance to rake in the full pot, and it's a big one. Get Johnny back on  the Range, Hunt--put him to work, hard. Sweat that sour temper and whisky  out of him. He used to be a promising youngster; now he's turning bronco  fast. All he seems to have learned in the war is how to use those guns of  his to lord it over anyone he believes he can push around. And someday  he'll try to push the wrong man--\"    _Don_ Cazar was staring ahead of him now at Drew and Shiloh. But Drew knew  that Hunt Rennie was not seeing either man or horse, but a mental picture  which was not too pleasing.    \"He's just a boy.\" Rennie did not utter that as an excuse; rather he said  it as if to reassure himself. Then his eyes really focused on Drew, and he  changed the subject abruptly.    \"Kirby, when the train comes in we sometimes set up a race or two. Any  thought of trying your colt against some of the local champions?\"    \"Oro perhaps?\" Drew counter-questioned.    Rennie laughed. \"Oh, so you've been talking, Fenner?\"    The scout came away from where Tar was still very audibly munching his  treat. \"Didn't know as how th' younker had him a runnin' hoss, _Don_  Cazar.\" He inspected Shiloh critically. \"But that thar sure looks a lotta  hoss. 'Course maybe he ain't used t' runnin' out here whar th' ground  ain't made all nice an' easy fur his feet. But I dunno, I dunno at all.\"    \"Anyway he'll give Oro stiffer competition than he's had in the last two  races. Unless that Lieutenant Spath up at the camp tries again with that  long-legged black of his,\" Topham added. \"What about it, Kirby? You  willing to match Shiloh?\"    \"He's green, but, yes, I'll do it.\"    Drew's motives were mixed. His pride in the colt had been pushing him  toward such a trial ever since he had heard Fenner speak of Oro. In  addition, as the owner of a noted horse, he would take a place in this  community, establish his identity as Drew Kirby. And in some way he could  not define, this put him, at least in his own mind, on an equal footing  with _Don_ Cazar.    But by the next morning a few doubts troubled him as he tightened saddle  cinches on the stallion. Shiloh's only races so far had been impromptu  matches along the trail. Though the colt had been consistently the victor,  none of his rivals had been in his class. And if Oro's speed was as  striking as his coloring, the Range stud would prove a formidable  opponent.    \"Walk him up and down here by the corral.\" The Kentuckian handed the reins  to Callie. \"Got something I have to do.\"    Drew went directly to the Four Jacks. This time the cantina was filled,  with a double row of the thirsty demanding attention at the bar. But  Topham was seated at a table with _Don_ Lorenzo and Zack Cahill of the  stage line. The Kentuckian went over to them.    \"You have come to back your horse, _senor_?\" _Don_ Lorenzo smiled up at  Drew. There were piles of coins on the table as Cahill listed bets for the  men crowding around.    \"Yes, suh.\" Drew spun down two double eagles. \"What're the odds?"]]]
