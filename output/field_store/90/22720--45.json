At the inner or side notch end drill a little  hole, through which place a piece of pointed wire to receive the bait.    The appearance of the three sticks when set is best explained by Fig  4; A. is the upright, B the slanting stick, and C bait or bottom  stick. To set it, take the upright in the left hand, chisel point up,  pick up B with the right hand, place it with its notch fitting on the  top of A, and keeping the slanting stick pressed down firmly, you hold  the two in proper position. This has relieved the left hand entirely,  which now is used to pick up c; place the side notch of this on the  upright A, slide it up until its end nick is caught by the point of B;  a sufficient leverage, as it were, being attained on this, we can hold  the whole of the trap now with the right hand. By grasping B with the  fingers of the hand in opposition to the palm, while the thumb presses  it down on the top, the left hand, being at liberty, is used to drag  the stone and to raise one end to fall on the top of B; the weight of  the stone now sets the three parts in opposition to each other. An  animal touching the bait in the slightest manner is sufficient to  destroy the nice balance of the whole affair, and down it comes with a  run. The sizes given--from a trap I have just set--are, of course, for  small animals only, but it may be enlarged or decreased to any extent,  at the pleasure of the operator.    Fig. 4--\"FIGURE of 4\" TRAP.    As \"Stonehenge\" and \"High Elms\" have introduced some improvements, I  may as well quote the former:    The Figure of 4 trap is composed of a large square piece of stone or  slate propped up in a peculiar manner with three pieces of wood, which  are arranged in the shape of a 4.    In examining this figure it will be seen to consist of a perpendicular  limb or upright, of a horizontal one or stretcher, and of a short  slanting stick, as the third is called. The upright is usually cut  about half an inch wide, shaved to a thin edge at top, but \"High Elms\"  recommends it to have a forked foot to keep it from twisting, and a  notch in it to prevent the stretcher slipping down. The slanting stick  has a notch cut in it half an inch from its upper end to receive the  top of the upright, while its lower end is shaved off to fit in a  notch in the upper surface of the front of the stretcher. Lastly, the  stretcher has this notch in front, and another notch cut in its side  by which it is caught by the upright and held in its place.    A bait being tied to the external end of the stretcher, and a stone  placed so that it will lie flat on the ground, the whole is ready for  setting, which is effected as follows: Raise the stone, and support it  by the notched end of the slanting stick held in the left hand, the  notch itself looking downwards, then place the upright with one end on  the ground and the other in this notch, and let it carry the weight of  the stone, which will have a tendency to tilt up the slanting stick  still held down by the left hand; finally, hitch the middle notch of  the stretcher in the upright, with its front notch facing upwards,  then bring the lower end of the slanting stick down to this front  notch, drop it in, and the trap is set. Of course, it requires that  each part shall be carefully adapted to the others, but when the trap  is seen set it will be readily understood, practice being, however,  required to set it properly.    I quite agree with \"High Elms\" that the footed upright is an  improvement; but I am inclined to doubt the advantage of the double  notch between the upright and the stretcher. I have tried both, and I  cannot find that there is any great superiority in his plan; but,  perhaps, though I have exactly followed his directions as given in the  Field, I may have omitted some point of practical importance. In  setting the Figure of 4 trap, the height of the upright and the size  and weight of the stone will be proportioned to the animal for which  it is set. I do not like the trap myself, as it cannot be concealed so  well as the steel trap, and, indeed, has no advantage except in  cheapness. Dozens of them may be set in the woods, and if stolen  little harm is done, as the cost is barely a penny apiece if made in  large numbers. I have also known pheasants caught by the head and  killed in them, the flesh with which they are baited being often  attractive to tame-bred birds, which usually are fed with more or less  of it in their rearing.    Mr. G. S. Purden has informed me that he has succeeded in capturing  birds alive with this trap by hollowing out the ground where the stone  falls.    Another \"deadfall\" for taking capercailzie in Norway is described by  Mr. Yarnell in his \"British Birds\":    \"Where the trees grow thickly on either side of a footpath, two long  pieces of wood are placed across it; one end of these rests on the  ground, the other being raised a foot and a half, or somewhat more,  from the surface, and supported by a piece communicating with a  triangular twig, placed in the centre of the path, and so contrived  that on being slightly touched the whole fabric falls; a few stones  are usually placed upon the long pieces of wood to increase the  rapidity of the drop by the additional weight. Birds running along the  footpath attempt to pass beneath the barrier, strike the twig, and are  killed by the fall of the trap.\"    Taking birds by means of bird-lime is my next consideration. Bird-lime  is made either from boiled oil or from holly-bark, but the making of  it is not \"worth the candle,\" it being so easily bought from any  professional bird-catcher.    To those who wish to make their own, I commend the following: Take  half a pint of linseed oil and put it into an old pot, or any vessel  that will stand the fire without breaking. The vessel should not be  more than one-third full. Place it over a slow fire and stir it until  it thickens as much as required. This can be ascertained by cooling  the stick in water and trying if it will stick to the fingers. When  sufficiently boiled, pour into cold water, and it will be found ready  for use.    I have submitted the foregoing to a practical birdcatcher and maker of  bird-lime, and he has \"passed\" it as correct, only adding that the oil  takes somewhere about four hours to slowly boil before it becomes  sufficiently tenacious for use. Holly-bark he does not believe in, as  he says it takes too long to make; but that is no reason why we should  pass over bird-lime made from this substance. The \"Encyclopaedia  Britannica\" says:    \"It is usually prepared by boiling holly-bark ten or twelve hours, and  when-the green coat is separated from the other it is covered up for a  fortnight in a moist place; then pounded into a rough paste, and  washed in a running stream till no motes appear. It is next put up to  ferment for four or five days, and repeatedly skimmed. To prepare it  for use, a third part of nut oil or thin grease must be incorporated  with it over the fire.\"    Bird-lime can also be made from many other plants, but the best  quality is made by either of the two methods mentioned above.    The \"Edinburgh Encyclopaedia\" says further that:    When bird-lime is about to be applied to use, it should be made hot,  and the rods or twigs should be warmed a little before they be dipped  in it. Where straws and cords are to be limed it should be very hot,  and after they are prepared they should be kept in a leather bag till  used. In order to prevent bird-lime from being congealed by cold, it  should be mixed with a little oil of petroleum; and, indeed, before  the common kind can be used at all, it must be melted over the fire  with a third part of nut oil or any thin grease, if that has not been  added in the preparation.    The smaller kinds of birds are frequently taken with bird-lime, which  is one of the most eligible modes in frost or snow, when all sorts of  small birds assemble in flocks, and which may be used in various ways.  Put the bird-lime into an earthen dish, with the addition of one ounce  of fresh lard to every quarter-pound of bird-lime, and melt the whole  gently over the fire. Take a quantity of wheat ears, with a foot of  the straw attached to thorn, and, having warmed the lime, that it may  spread the thinner, lime about six inches of the straw from the bottom  of the ears. Scatter a little chaff and thrashed ears over a compass  of twenty yards; stick the limed straws into the ground, with the ears  inclining downwards, or even touching the surface; traverse the  adjoining places in order to disturb the birds, and make them fly  towards the snare, and, by pecking at the ears of corn, they will  become so entangled with the limed straw as to be easily taken by the  hand.    The lime may also be applied to cords, rods, and twigs, especially  when it is intended to entangle the larger birds, such as snipes and  fieldfares, and for this purpose the following mode may be adopted:  Take the main branch of any bushy tree, with long, straight, and  smooth twigs, such as the willow or birch, clear the twigs from every  notch and prickle, lime the branches to within four fingers of the  bottom, leaving the main bough from which the others rise untouched by  the composition, and then place the bush where the birds resort. For  small birds two to three hundred single twigs, about the thickness of  a rush and three inches in length, may be stuck in sheaves of flag and  corn.    In hot and dry weather the twigs may be placed around the rivulets,  ditches, and pools to which the birds come for drink, covering the  waters at the same time with brushwood, so that they can have no  access to quench their thirst, except at the spot where the twigs are  fixed. For this purpose the rods or twigs should be about a foot in"]]]
