Herzl urged David Wolffsohn and  Jacobus Kahn to proceed with the utmost speed to incorporate the  Jewish Colonial Trust. He foresaw the possibility that a demand might  be made at any time to show the color of his money. Although the  affairs of the Bank were in the hands of Wolffsohn and Kahn, Herzl  himself worried over every detail, urging and driving and complaining  about the slowness of the action. On March 28, 1899 the subscription  lists were opened. Herzl's expectations were not fulfilled. Only about  200,000 shares had been sold, three-quarters of them in Russia. The  Bank could not be opened until it had at least 250,000 paid-up shares.  After a great deal of effort, the minimum was finally obtained and the  Trust was officially opened in time for the opening of the third  Congress in August, 1899.    Herzl addressed a mass meeting in London in October, 1899, under Dr.  Gastner's chairmanship. In his address at this meeting, Herzl said  that he believed the time was not far off when the Jewish people would  be set in motion. He asked the audience to accept his word even if he  could not speak more definitely. \"When I return to you again,\" he  said, \"we shall, I hope, be still further on our path.\" At this  meeting Father Ignatius, a Catholic believer in Zionism, referred to  Herzl \"as a new Joshua who had come to fulfill the words of the  Prophet Ezekiel.\" The effect produced upon the audience was not useful  to Herzl's purposes at that time. He had always tried to discourage  the impression of himself as a Messianic figure. The meeting in London  was the only occasion where he lost his self-mastery in public.    When Herzl met the Foreign Minister, Von Buelow, again, it was in the  presence of the Reich Chancellor, Hohenlohe. At once he perceived a  different nuance in the conversation and a dissonance in comparison  with the conversation he had had with Count Eulenberg. He thought that  the Chancellor and the Foreign Minister were not in agreement with the  Kaiser and did not dare to say it openly; or, on the other hand, they  might be favorably inclined but would not be willing to say it to him.    Finally, Herzl saw the Kaiser in Constantinople. After Herzl had  introduced the subject of his visit, the Kaiser broke in and explained  why the Zionist movement attracted him.    \"There are among your people,\" said the Kaiser, \"certain elements whom  it would be a good thing to move to Palestine.\"    He asked Herzl to submit, in advance, the address he intended to  present to him in Jerusalem. When he was asked what the Kaiser should  place before the Sultan as the gist of the Jewish proposals, Herzl  replied \"a chartered company under German protection.\"    Herzl met the Kaiser, as arranged, in Palestine. Herzl arrived in  Jaffa on October 6, 1898. On a Friday morning, he awaited the coming  of the Kaiser and his entourage on the road that ran by the Colony of  Mikveh Israel. The Kaiser recognized him from a distance. He said a  few words about the weather, about the lack of water in Palestine, and  that it was a land that had a future.    In the petition Herzl later submitted to the Kaiser, many of the  pregnant passages were deleted by the Kaiser's advisers. All passages  that referred specifically to the aims of the Zionist movement, to the  desperate need of the Jewish people and asking for the Kaiser's  protection of a projected Jewish land company for Syria and Palestine,  had been removed. The audience with the Kaiser took place on Monday,  November 2nd. The Kaiser thanked Herzl for the address which, he said,  had interested him extremely. It was the Kaiser's opinion that the  soil was cultivable. What the land lacked was water and shade.    \"That we can supply,\" said Herzl. \"It would cost billions, but it will  bring in billions too.\"    \"Well, you certainly have enough money, more than all of us,\" said the  Kaiser.    It was a brief interview. It was vague and seemed to lead nowhere.  Herzl was under the impression that certain influences had been  exerted between the interview in Constantinople and the audience in  Jerusalem.    When the official German communique was issued, the encounter with  Herzl was hid in a closing paragraph and deprived of all significance.  This is how it read:    \"Later the Kaiser received the French Consul, also a Jewish deputation  which presented him with an album of pictures of the Jewish colonies  in Palestine. In reply to an address by the leader of the deputation,  His Majesty remarked he viewed with benevolent interest all efforts  directed to the improvement of agriculture in Palestine as long as  these accorded with the welfare of the Turkish Empire and were  conducted in a spirit of complete respect for the sovereignty of the  Sultan.\"    It was a sudden descent from hope into a closed road. Herzl refused to  be discouraged. It was hard for him to realize that the Kaiser's  enthusiasm in Constantinople could have cooled off so quickly in  Jerusalem, but it seemed that there was no way to continue contact  with the people he had interested in Germany. He tried to pick up the  broken threads, but, once broken, they could not be revived. The Grand  Duke of Baden remained ever constant and loyal, but he could do  nothing. Herzl never saw the Kaiser again. In a letter to the Grand  Duke, closing this chapter of Zionist history, Herzl said:    \"I can only assume that a hope especially dear to me has faded away  and that we shall not achieve our Zionist goal under a German  protectorate.\"    At about the same time, Herzl met Philip Michael Von Nevlinski, a  descendant of a long line of Polish noblemen who had entered the  diplomatic service and became a diplomatic agent-at-large and a French  journalist. In the first stages, Nevlinski guided Herzl in all the  work he did in Constantinople. When Herzl came to Constantinople in  June, 1896 he was under the impression that Nevlinski had already  arranged an audience with the Sultan. It was not so easy, however. But  whether such an audience had been arranged or not, Herzl was able to  meet, a number of highly-placed Turkish officials, including the Grand  Vizier. At first, the line of action was not clear, but by now Herzl  had formulated his proposals to the Sultan.    Ever since the middle of the nineteenth century, Turkish finances had  been in a shocking condition. The Empire was being badly managed. The  Sultan was regarded as \"the sick man of Europe.\" In 1891 the total  external debt, including unpaid interest, reached the figure of two  hundred and fifty-three million pounds sterling. In 1881 there was a  consolidation of the debt. It was reduced to one hundred and six  million pounds, but the finances of Turkey were placed under the  control of a committee representing the creditors, to whom was  transferred certain domestic Turkish monopolies and the collection of  several categories of taxes. This enabled the European powers to  intervene in the affairs of Turkey. Only by the removal of this  foreign tutelage could Turkey hope to regain its independence. It was  to achieve this end, Herzl thought, that the Jews, and the Jews alone,  could be useful. For this service, he intended to ask for a Jewish  State in Palestine. Herzl followed this line until finally the need  for refunding the Turkish debt disappeared.    But at this time Herzl was not able to obtain an audience with the  Sultan. Nevlinski reported that such an audience had been refused  because the Sultan declined to discuss sovereignty over Palestine.  Doubt was expressed as to the accuracy of the report. Whatever the  fact may be, the first venture of Herzl in Constantinople was not  successful.    Herzl moved along the lines that led to Constantinople and Berlin, but  he did not overlook the importance of maintaining contact with Jewish  philanthropies. A letter sent to the Baron de Hirsch came a day after  his death.    Herzl went to London where matters had been arranged for him to meet  the leaders of British Jewry. He met Claude Montefiore and Frederick  Mocatte, representatives of the Anglo-Jewish Association. They were  not sympathetic. Herzl fared no better at a banquet given to him by  the Maccabbeans. The personal impression Herzl made was profound. But  there was no practical issue nor did he make any progress during the  time he spent in England. He got Sir Samuel Montagu and Colonel  Goldsmith to agree to cooperate with him in an endeavor to establish a  vassal Jewish State under the sovereignty of Turkey if the Powers  would agree; provided, the Baron de Hirsch Fund placed L10,000,000 at  his disposal for the plan; and Baron Edmund de Rothschild became a  member of the Executive Committee of the proposed Society of Jews.  These conditions were fantastic at that time and Herzl could not meet  them.    He went to Paris and had a talk with Baron Edmund. Baron Edmund was  older than Herzl and felt ill at ease in the presence of a calm critic  of all he had done for Jewish colonization in Palestine. Herzl made  the impression on him of an undisciplined enthusiast. Baron Edmund did  not believe it possible to create political conditions favorable for a  mass immigration of Jews. Even if that could be done, an uncontrolled  mass immigration into Palestine would have the effect of landing tens  of thousands of Jews to be fed and looked after by the small Jewish  community in Palestine. He clung to his idea of slow colonization  attracting no attention and careful not to provoke hostility. Every  reply of Herzl fell upon a closed mind. Baron Edmund's refusal to  cooperate was decisive.    This was a decision of historic significance. It turned Herzl away  from the thought that the Zionist movement should be built upon the  support of Jewish philanthropy. All his hopes in this connection were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2529"],[0,"The Analysis of Mind (#7)"],[1," theory  of human nature which they find current, and attribute to themselves  whatever wishes this theory would lead them to expect. We used to be  full of virtuous wishes, but since Freud our wishes have become, in  the words of the Prophet Jeremiah, \"deceitful above all things and  desperately wicked.\" Both these views, in most of those who have held  them, are the product of theory rather than observation, for observation  requires effort, whereas repeating phrases does not.         * Cf. Hart, \"The Psychology of Insanity,\" p. 19.    The interpretation of unconscious wishes which I have been advocating  has been set forth briefly by Professor John B. Watson in an article  called \"The Psychology of Wish Fulfilment,\" which appeared in \"The  Scientific Monthly\" in November, 1916. Two quotations will serve to show  his point of view:    \"The Freudians (he says) have made more or less of a 'metaphysical  entity' out of the censor. They suppose that when wishes are repressed  they are repressed into the 'unconscious,' and that this mysterious  censor stands at the trapdoor lying between the conscious and the  unconscious. Many of us do not believe in a world of the unconscious  (a few of us even have grave doubts about the usefulness of the term  consciousness), hence we try to explain censorship along ordinary  biological lines. We believe that one group of habits can 'down' another  group of habits--or instincts. In this case our ordinary system of  habits--those which we call expressive of our 'real selves'--inhibit  or quench (keep inactive or partially inactive) those habits and  instinctive tendencies which belong largely in the past\"(p. 483).    Again, after speaking of the frustration of some impulses which is  involved in acquiring the habits of a civilized adult, he continues:    \"It is among these frustrated impulses that I would find the biological  basis of the unfulfilled wish. Such 'wishes' need never have been  'conscious,' and NEED NEVER HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED INTO FREUD'S REALM  OF THE UNCONSCIOUS. It may be inferred from this that there is no  particular reason for applying the term 'wish' to such tendencies\"(p.  485).    One of the merits of the general analysis of mind which we shall  be concerned with in the following lectures is that it removes the  atmosphere of mystery from the phenomena brought to light by the  psycho-analysts. Mystery is delightful, but unscientific, since it  depends upon ignorance. Man has developed out of the animals, and  there is no serious gap between him and the amoeba. Something closely  analogous to knowledge and desire, as regards its effects on behaviour,  exists among animals, even where what we call \"consciousness\" is hard  to believe in; something equally analogous exists in ourselves in cases  where no trace of \"consciousness\" can be found. It is therefore  natural to suppose that, what ever may be the correct definition of  \"consciousness,\" \"consciousness\" is not the essence of life or mind. In  the following lectures, accordingly, this term will disappear until we  have dealt with words, when it will re-emerge as mainly a trivial and  unimportant outcome of linguistic habits.          LECTURE II. INSTINCT AND HABIT    In attempting to understand the elements out of which mental phenomena  are compounded, it is of the greatest importance to remember that from  the protozoa to man there is nowhere a very wide gap either in structure  or in behaviour. From this fact it is a highly probable inference that  there is also nowhere a very wide mental gap. It is, of course, POSSIBLE  that there may be, at certain stages in evolution, elements which are  entirely new from the standpoint of analysis, though in their nascent  form they have little influence on behaviour and no very marked  correlatives in structure. But the hypothesis of continuity in mental  development is clearly preferable if no psychological facts make it  impossible. We shall find, if I am not mistaken, that there are no facts  which refute the hypothesis of mental continuity, and that, on the other  hand, this hypothesis affords a useful test of suggested theories as to  the nature of mind.    The hypothesis of mental continuity throughout organic evolution may be  used in two different ways. On the one hand, it may be held that we  have more knowledge of our own minds than those of animals, and that we  should use this knowledge to infer the existence of something similar  to our own mental processes in animals and even in plants. On the other  hand, it may be held that animals and plants present simpler phenomena,  more easily analysed than those of human minds; on this ground it may be  urged that explanations which are adequate in the case of animals ought  not to be lightly rejected in the case of man. The practical effects of  these two views are diametrically opposite: the first leads us to level  up animal intelligence with what we believe ourselves to know about our  own intelligence, while the second leads us to attempt a levelling down  of our own intelligence to something not too remote from what we can  observe in animals. It is therefore important to consider the relative  justification of the two ways of applying the principle of continuity.    It is clear that the question turns upon another, namely, which can we  know best, the psychology of animals or that of human beings? If we  can know most about animals, we shall use this knowledge as a basis for  inference about human beings; if we can know most about human beings, we  shall adopt the opposite procedure. And the question whether we can know  most about the psychology of human beings or about that of animals turns  upon yet another, namely: Is introspection or external observation  the surer method in psychology? This is a question which I propose to  discuss at length in Lecture VI; I shall therefore content myself now  with a statement of the conclusions to be arrived at.    We know a great many things concerning ourselves which we cannot know  nearly so directly concerning animals or even other people. We know when  we have a toothache, what we are thinking of, what dreams we have when  we are asleep, and a host of other occurrences which we only know about  others when they tell us of them, or otherwise make them inferable  by their behaviour. Thus, so far as knowledge of detached facts is  concerned, the advantage is on the side of self-knowledge as against  external observation.    But when we come to the analysis and scientific understanding of the  facts, the advantages on the side of self-knowledge become far less  clear. We know, for example, that we have desires and beliefs, but we  do not know what constitutes a desire or a belief. The phenomena are so  familiar that it is difficult to realize how little we really know about  them. We see in animals, and to a lesser extent in plants, behaviour  more or less similar to that which, in us, is prompted by desires and  beliefs, and we find that, as we descend in the scale of evolution,  behaviour becomes simpler, more easily reducible to rule, more  scientifically analysable and predictable. And just because we are not  misled by familiarity we find it easier to be cautious in interpreting  behaviour when we are dealing with phenomena remote from those of our  own minds: Moreover, introspection, as psychoanalysis has demonstrated,  is extraordinarily fallible even in cases where we feel a high degree of  certainty. The net result seems to be that, though self-knowledge has  a definite and important contribution to make to psychology, it is  exceedingly misleading unless it is constantly checked and controlled  by the test of external observation, and by the theories which such  observation suggests when applied to animal behaviour. On the whole,  therefore, there is probably more to be learnt about human psychology  from animals than about animal psychology from human beings; but this  conclusion is one of degree, and must not be pressed beyond a point.    It is only bodily phenomena that can be directly observed in animals,  or even, strictly speaking, in other human beings. We can observe such  things as their movements, their physiological processes, and the sounds  they emit. Such things as desires and beliefs, which seem obvious  to introspection, are not visible directly to external observation.  Accordingly, if we begin our study of psychology by external  observation, we must not begin by assuming such things as desires and  beliefs, but only such things as external observation can reveal, which  will be characteristics of the movements and physiological processes of  animals. Some animals, for example, always run away from light and hide  themselves in dark places. If you pick up a mossy stone which is lightly  embedded in the earth, you will see a number of small animals scuttling  away from the unwonted daylight and seeking again the darkness of which  you have deprived them. Such animals are sensitive to light, in the  sense that their movements are affected by it; but it would be rash to  infer that they have sensations in any way analogous to our sensations  of sight. Such inferences, which go beyond the observable facts, are to  be avoided with the utmost care.    It is customary to divide human movements into three classes, voluntary,  reflex and mechanical. We may illustrate the distinction by a quotation  from William James (\"Psychology,\" i, 12):    \"If I hear the conductor calling 'all aboard' as I enter the depot, my  heart first stops, then palpitates, and my legs respond to the air-waves  falling on my tympanum by quickening their movements. If I stumble as I  run, the sensation of falling provokes a movement of the hands towards  the direction of the fall, the effect of which is to shield the body  from too sudden a shock. If a cinder enter my eye, its lids close  forcibly and a copious flow of tears tends to wash it out.    \"These three"]]]
