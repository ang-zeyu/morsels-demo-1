On the day after the sermon,  Manning walked out to the neighbouring village of Littlemore, where  Newman was now living in retirement with a few chosen disciples, in the  hope of being able to give a satisfactory explanation of what he had  done. But he was disappointed; for when, after an awkward interval, one  of the disciples appeared at the door, he was informed that Mr. Newman  was not at home.    With his retirement to Littlemore, Newman had entered upon the final  period of his Anglican career. Even he could no longer help perceiving  that the end was now only a matter of time. His progress was hastened in  an agitating manner by the indiscreet activity of one of his proselytes,  W. G. Ward. a young man who combined an extraordinary aptitude for a  priori reasoning with a passionate devotion to Opera Bouffe. It was  difficult, in fact, to decide whether the inner nature of Ward was more  truly expressing itself when he was firing off some train of scholastic  paradoxes on the Eucharist or when he was trilling the airs of Figaro  and plunging through the hilarious roulades of the Largo al Factotum.  Even Dr. Pusey could not be quite sure, though he was Ward's spiritual  director. On one occasion his young penitent came to him, and confessed  that a vow which he had taken to abstain from music during Lent was  beginning to affect his health. Could Dr. Pusey see his way to releasing  him from the vow? The Doctor decided that a little sacred music would  not be amiss. Ward was all gratitude, and that night a party was  arranged in a friend's rooms. The concert began with the solemn  harmonies of Handel, which were followed by the holy strains of the 'Oh  Salutaris' of Cherubini. Then came the elevation and the pomp of  'Possenti Numi' from the Magic Flute. But, alas! there lies much danger  in Mozart. The page was turned and there was the delicious duet between  Papageno and Papagena. Flesh and blood could not resist that; then song  followed song, the music waxed faster and lighter, until, at last Ward  burst into the intoxicating merriment of the Largo al Factotum. When it  was over, a faint but persistent knocking made itself heard upon the  wall; and it was only then that the company remembered that the rooms  next door were Dr. Pusey's.    The same entrainment which carried Ward away when he sat down to a piano  possessed him whenever he embarked on a religious discussion. 'The thing  that was utterly abhorrent to him,' said one of his friends, 'was to  stop short.' Given the premises, he would follow out their implications  with the mercilessness of a medieval monk, and when he had reached the  last limits of argument, be ready to maintain whatever propositions he  might find there with his dying breath. He had the extreme innocence of  a child and a mathematician. Captivated by the glittering eye of Newman,  he swallowed whole the supernatural conception of the universe which  Newman had evolved, accepted it as a fundamental premise, and 'began at  once to deduce from it whatsoever there might be to be deduced.' His  very first deductions included irrefutable proofs of (I) God's  particular providence for individuals; (2) the real efficacy of  intercessory prayer; (3) the reality of our communion with the saints  departed; (4) the constant presence and assistance of the angels of God.  Later on he explained mathematically the importance of the Ember Days:  'Who can tell,' he added, 'the degree of blessing lost to us in this  land by neglecting, as we alone of Christian Churches do neglect, these  holy days?' He then proceeded to convict the Reformers, not only of  rebellion, but'--for my own part I see not how we can avoid adding--of  perjury.' Every day his arguments became more extreme, more rigorously  exact, and more distressing to his master. Newman was in the position of  a cautious commander-in-chief being hurried into an engagement against  his will by a dashing cavalry officer. Ward forced him forward step by  step towards-no! he could not bear it; he shuddered and drew back. But  it was of no avail. In vain did Keble and Pusey wring their hands and  stretch forth their pleading arms to their now vanishing brother. The  fatal moment was fast approaching. Ward at last published a devastating  book in which he proved conclusively, by a series of syllogisms, that  the only proper course for the Church of England was to repent in  sackcloth and ashes her separation from the Communion of Rome. The  reckless author was deprived of his degree by an outraged University,  and a few weeks later was received into the Catholic Church.    Newman, in a kind of despair, had flung himself into the labours of  historical compilation. His views of history had changed since the days  when, as an undergraduate, he had feasted on the worldly pages of  Gibbon.    'Revealed religion,' he now thought, 'furnishes facts to other sciences,  which those sciences, left to themselves, would never reach. Thus, in  the science of history, the preservation of our race in Noah's Ark is an  historical fact, which history never would arrive at without  revelation.'    With these principles to guide him, he plunged with his disciples into a  prolonged study of the English Saints. Biographies soon appeared of St.  Bega, St. Adamnan, St. Gundleus, St. Guthlake, Brother Drithelm, St.  Amphibalus, St. Wuistan, St. Ebba, St. Neot, St. Ninian, and Cunibert  the Hermit. Their austerities, their virginity, and their miraculous  powers were described in detail. The public learned with astonishment  that St Ninian had turned a staff into a tree; that St. German had  stopped a cock from crowing, and that a child had been raised from the  dead to convert St. Helier. The series has subsequently been continued  by a more modern writer whose relation of the history of the blessed St.  Mael contains, perhaps, even more matter for edification than Newman's  biographies.    At the time, indeed, those works caused considerable scandal. Clergymen  denounced them in pamphlets. St. Cuthbert was described by his  biographer as having 'carried the jealousy of women, characteristic of  all the saints, to an extraordinary pitch'. An example was given,  whenever he held a spiritual conversation with St Ebba, he was careful  to spend the ensuing ours of darkness 'in prayer, up to his neck in  water'. 'Persons who invent such tales,' wrote one indignant  commentator, 'cast very grave and just suspicions on the purity of their  own minds. And young persons, who talk and think in this way, are in  extreme danger of falling into sinful habits. As to the volumes before  us, the authors have, in their fanatical panegyrics of virginity, made  use of language downright profane.'    One of the disciples at Littlemore was James Anthony Froude, the younger  brother of Hurrell, and it fell to his lot to be responsible for the  biography of St. Neot. While he was composing it, he began to feel some  qualms. Saints who lighted fires with icicles, changed bandits into  wolves, and floated across the Irish Channel on altar-stones, produced a  disturbing effect on his historical conscience. But he had promised his  services to Newman, and he determined to carry through the work in the  spirit in which he had begun it. He did so; but he thought it proper to  add the following sentence by way of conclusion: 'This is all, and  indeed rather more than all, that is known to men of the blessed St.  Neot; but not more than is known to the angels in heaven.'    Meanwhile, the English Roman Catholics were growing impatient; was the  great conversion never coming, for which they had prayed so fervently  and so long? Dr. Wiseman, at the head of them, was watching and waiting  with special eagerness. His hand was held out under the ripening fruit;  the delicious morsel seemed to be trembling on its stalk; and yet it did  not fall. At last, unable to bear the suspense any longer, he dispatched  to Littlemore Father Smith, an old pupil of Newman's, who had lately  joined the Roman communion, with instructions that he should do his  best, under cover of a simple visit of friendship, to discover how the  land lay. Father Smith was received somewhat coldly, and the  conversation ran entirely on topics which had nothing to do with  religion. When the company separated before dinner, he was beginning to  think that his errand had been useless; but, on their reassembling, he  suddenly noticed that Newman had changed his trousers, and that the  colour of the pair which he was now wearing was grey. At the earliest  moment, the emissary rushed back post-haste to Dr. Wiseman. 'All is  well,' he exclaimed; 'Newman no longer considers that he is in Anglican  orders.\" Praise be to God!' answered Dr Wiseman. 'But how do you know?'  Father Smith described what he had seen. 'Oh, is that all? My dear  father, how can you be so foolish?' But Father Smith was not to be  shaken. 'I know the man,' he said, and I know what it means. 'Newman will  come, and he will come soon.'    And Father Smith was right. A few weeks later, Newman suddenly slipped  off to a priest, and all was over. Perhaps he would have hesitated  longer still, if he could have foreseen how he was to pass the next  thirty years of his unfortunate existence; but the future was hidden,  and all that was certain was that the past had gone forever, and that  his eyes would rest no more upon the snapdragons of Trinity.    The Oxford Movement was now ended. The University breathed such a sigh  of relief as usually follows the difficult expulsion of a hard piece of  matter from a living organism, and actually began to attend to  education. As for the Church of England, she had tasted blood, and it  was clear that she would never again be content with a vegetable diet.  Her clergy, however, maintained their reputation for judicious  compromise, for they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#7)"],[1," the same object of  vengeance, or was more particularly directed to revenue, does not  matter, since the claim of the king did not enlarge the scope of  the action.    It would seem to be a fair inference that indictable offences  were originally limited in the same way as those which gave rise  to an appeal. For whether the indictment arose by a splitting up  of the appeal, or in some other way, the two were closely  connected.    An acquittal of the appellee on the merits was a bar to an  indictment; and, on the other hand, when an appeal was fairly  started, although the appellor might fail to prosecute, or might  be defeated by plea, the cause might still be proceeded with on  behalf of the king. /1/    [40] The presentment, which is the other parent of our criminal  procedure, had an origin distinct from the appeal. If, as has  been thought, it was merely the successor of fresh suit and lynch  law, /1/ this also is the child of vengeance, even more clearly  than the other.    The desire for vengeance imports an opinion that its object is  actually and personally to blame. It takes an internal standard,  not an objective or external one, and condemns its victim by  that. The question is whether such a standard is still accepted  either in this primitive form, or in some more refined  development, as is commonly supposed, and as seems not  impossible, considering the relative slowness with which the  criminal law has improved.    It certainly may be argued, with some force, that it has never  ceased to be one object of punishment to satisfy the desire for  vengeance. The argument will be made plain by considering those  instances in which, for one reason or another, compensation for a  wrong is out of the question.    Thus an act may be of such a kind as to make indemnity impossible  by putting an end to the principal sufferer, as in the case of  murder or manslaughter.    Again, these and other crimes, like forgery, although directed  against an individual, tend to make others feel unsafe, and this  general insecurity does not admit of being paid for.    Again, there are cases where there are no means of enforcing  indemnity. In Macaulay's draft of the Indian Penal Code, breaches  of contract for the carriage of passengers, were made criminal.  The palanquin-bearers of India were too poor to pay damages, and  yet had to be [41] trusted to carry unprotected women and  children through wild and desolate tracts, where their desertion  would have placed those under their charge in great danger.    In all these cases punishment remains as an alternative. A pain  can be inflicted upon the wrong-doer, of a sort which does not  restore the injured party to his former situation, or to another  equally good, but which is inflicted for the very purpose of  causing pain. And so far as this punishment takes the place of  compensation, whether on account of the death of the person to  whom the wrong was done, the indefinite number of persons  affected, the impossibility of estimating the worth of the  suffering in money, or the poverty of the criminal, it may be  said that one of its objects is to gratify the desire for  vengeance. The prisoner pays with his body.    The statement may be made stronger still, and it may be said, not  only that the law does, but that it ought to, make the  gratification of revenge an object. This is the opinion, at any  rate, of two authorities so great, and so opposed in other views,  as Bishop Butler and Jeremy Bentham. /1/ Sir James Stephen says,  \"The criminal law stands to the passion of revenge in much the  same relation as marriage to the sexual appetite.\" /2/    The first requirement of a sound body of law is, that it should  correspond with the actual feelings and demands of the community,  whether right or wrong. If people would gratify the passion of  revenge outside of the law, if the law did not help them, the law  has no choice but to satisfy the craving itself, and thus avoid  the greater evil of private [42] retribution. At the same time,  this passion is not one which we encourage, either as private  individuals or as lawmakers. Moreover, it does not cover the  whole ground. There are crimes which do not excite it, and we  should naturally expect that the most important purposes of  punishment would be coextensive with the whole field of its  application. It remains to be discovered whether such a general  purpose exists, and if so what it is. Different theories still  divide opinion upon the subject.    It has been thought that the purpose of punishment is to reform  the criminal; that it is to deter the criminal and others from  committing similar crimes; and that it is retribution. Few would  now maintain that the first of these purposes was the only one.  If it were, every prisoner should be released as soon as it  appears clear that he will never repeat his offence, and if he is  incurable he should not be punished at all. Of course it would be  hard to reconcile the punishment of death with this doctrine.    The main struggle lies between the other two. On the one side is  the notion that there is a mystic bond between wrong and  punishment; on the other, that the infliction of pain is only a  means to an end. Hegel, one of the great expounders of the former  view, puts it, in his quasi mathematical form, that, wrong being  the negation of right, punishment is the negation of that  negation, or retribution. Thus the punishment must be equal, in  the sense of proportionate to the crime, because its only  function is to destroy it. Others, without this logical  apparatus, are content to rely upon a felt necessity that  suffering should follow wrong-doing.    It is objected that the preventive theory is immoral, because it  overlooks the ill-desert of wrong-doing, and furnishes [43] no  measure of the amount of punishment, except the lawgiver's  subjective opinion in regard to the sufficiency of the amount of  preventive suffering. /1/ In the language of Kant, it treats man  as a thing, not as a person; as a means, not as an end in  himself. It is said to conflict with the sense of justice, and to  violate the fundamental principle of all free communities, that  the members of such communities have equal rights to life,  liberty, and personal security. /2/    In spite of all this, probably most English-speaking lawyers  would accept the preventive theory without hesitation. As to the  violation of equal rights which is charged, it may be replied  that the dogma of equality makes an equation between individuals  only, not between an individual and the community. No society has  ever admitted that it could not sacrifice individual welfare to  its own existence. If conscripts are necessary for its army, it  seizes them, and marches them, with bayonets in their rear, to  death. It runs highways and railroads through old family places  in spite of the owner's protest, paying in this instance the  market value, to be sure, because no civilized government  sacrifices the citizen more than it can help, but still  sacrificing his will and his welfare to that of the rest. /3/    If it were necessary to trench further upon the field of morals,  it might be suggested that the dogma of equality applied even to  individuals only within the limits of ordinary dealings in the  common run of affairs. You cannot argue with your neighbor,  except on the admission for the [44] moment that he is as wise as  you, although you may by no means believe it. In the same way,  you cannot deal with him, where both are free to choose, except  on the footing of equal treatment, and the same rules for both.  The ever-growing value set upon peace and the social relations  tends to give the law of social being the appearance of the law  of all being. But it seems to me clear that the ultima ratio, not  only regum, but of private persons, is force, and that at the  bottom of all private relations, however tempered by sympathy and  all the social feelings, is a justifiable self-preference. If a  man is on a plank in the deep sea which will only float one, and  a stranger lays hold of it, he will thrust him off if he can.  When the state finds itself in a similar position, it does the  same thing.    The considerations which answer the argument of equal rights also  answer the objections to treating man as a thing, and the like.  If a man lives in society, he is liable to find himself so  treated. The degree of civilization which a people has reached,  no doubt, is marked by their anxiety to do as they would be done  by. It may be the destiny of man that the social instincts shall  grow to control his actions absolutely, even in anti-social  situations. But they have not yet done so, and as the rules of  law are or should be based upon a morality which is generally  accepted, no rule founded on a theory of absolute unselfishness  can be laid down without a breach between law and working  beliefs.    If it be true, as I shall presently try to show, that the general  principles of criminal and civil liability are the same, it will  follow from that alone that theory and fact agree in frequently  punishing those who have been guilty [45] of no moral wrong, and  who could not be condemned by any standard that did not avowedly  disregard the personal peculiarities of the individuals  concerned. If punishment stood on the moral grounds which are  proposed for it, the first thing to be considered would be those  limitations in the capacity for choosing rightly which arise from  abnormal instincts, want of education, lack of intelligence, and  all the other defects which are most marked in the criminal  classes. I do not say that they should not be, or at least I do  not need to for my argument. I do not say that the criminal law  does more good than harm. I only say that it is not enacted or  administered on that theory.    There remains to be mentioned the affirmative argument in favor  of the theory of"]]]
