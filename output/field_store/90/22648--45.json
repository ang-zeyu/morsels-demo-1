The dowel need not extend all the  way through the piece, but should be put in from the surface where the  grain of the dowel will be least objectionable.    When putting screws in hard wood much labor will be saved by applying  soap to the threads.          A WALL CASE WITH A MIRROR DOOR      The wall case shown in the accompanying picture will serve well as a  medicine case. Having a paneled door in which is set a mirror, it serves  equally well as a shaving case. It is best made of some hard wood,  though a soft wood such as pine or yellow poplar will work up easier and  look well finished with three or four coats of white enamel paint.    There will be needed the following pieces:      2 sides, 5/8 by 6 by 32-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 top and 1 bottom, 5/8 by 6 by 18 in., S-4-S.    1 top of back, 1/2 by 4 by 16-1/4 in., S-2-S.    1 bottom of back, 1/2 by 3 by 16-1/4 in., S-4-S.    1 shelf, 5/8 by 5 by 16 in., S-4-S.    1 back, 1/4 by 16 by 21 in., S-2-S.    DOOR      2 stiles, 5/8 by 3 by 20-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 top rail, 5/8 by 2 by 11 in., S-4-S.    1 bottom rail, 5/8 by 4 by 11 in., S-4-S.    1 backing for door, 3/16 by 10 by 15 in., S-2-S.    First shape the ends of the two side pieces as shown in the drawing.  Next square the top and bottom pieces of the case to size, and lay out  and cut the tenons on the ends. Lay out and cut the mortises in the  side pieces, also the groove for the shelf, having first squared the  shelf to size. Cut and shape the top and bottom pieces of the back as  shown. Cut the rebates in the side pieces into which these pieces are to  rest their ends. Cut the rebate for the back. Thoroughly scrape and  sandpaper these parts and assemble them. Cut and fit the back in place.    [Illustration: Wall Case Details]    The door is to be made next. Plan the different parts of the door so  that the edges may be planed to fit the opening; that is, make the door  a good quarter larger at top and bottom than the opening. In cutting the  rebate the easiest way is to use a rabbeting plane and cut the full  length of the pieces. By using a tenon on the rails in which one  shoulder is as much longer than the other as the rebate is deep there is  no resulting groove showing at the corner.    [Illustration: Case with Mirror Door]    The wood should be finished before the glass is set, at least, it should  be filled, if of hard wood, and one coat of paint put on, if of soft  wood which is to be enameled.    In setting the glass, place a thin cushion of putty between the rebate  and the glass and another thin cushion between the glass and the fillet  of wood or the backing which is to protect the back of the glass.    Fit the door, and then put on the hinges and lock. If desired, the  tenons may be made keyed as shown in the photograph instead of through  as shown in the drawing.    To finish the case, if of oak, apply a coat of light paste filler, the  directions being on the filler can. Next put on a coat of white shellac.  When this has hardened apply two coats of some good varnish. Allow time  for each coat to harden and rub the first coats with haircloth or curled  hair, and the last with pulverized pumice and raw linseed oil or crude  oil.    If the wood is soft and an enamel white is desired, the enamel is  applied not unlike paint. The directions will be found on the cans in  which the paint is purchased.          A SIDE CHAIR      A side chair of simple design and construction is here given. The great  difficulty with most chair designs is that the back is generally  designed narrower than the front, thus necessitating the rails entering  the posts or legs at angles. To the amateur this is quite confusing. The  chair illustrated is the same in width, both back and front, so that the  shoulders of all the rails are at right angles to the sides. The back of  the chair is straight, thus simplifying the design still more.    [Illustration: Side Chair Complete]    Another thing which is confusing to the beginner in his efforts to lay  out the mortises is the irregular placing of the rails. It will be noted  that in this design the rails of side, front and back are on the same  level.    Plain sawed red oak will be appropriate for this piece. Have the pieces  mill-planed and sandpapered on four sides to size, allowing 1/2 in.  extra to the lengths for squaring up the ends.    [Illustration: Details of Side Chair]    There will be needed the following:      4 rails, 7/8 by 2 by 17-1/2 in.    4 rails, 3/4 by 2 by 17-1/2 in.    2 front posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 19 in.    2 rear posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 37-1/2 in.    1 back, 3/4 by 9-3/4 by 17-1/2 in.    2 cleats, 3/8 by 1 by 16 in.    4 slats, 3/8 by 2 by 16-1/2 in.    Begin work by cutting the posts to the lengths indicated in the drawing.  The lower ends should be chamfered slightly to prevent their splintering  from usage. The top ends are cut to an angle of 45 deg., the slope  beginning 1/2 in. below the top. Lay out and cut the mortises. To do  this, lay off the measurements on one of the posts, then place all four  side by side on the bench, with the face marks up. Even the ends with  the try-square and then carry the measurements just made across all of  them, using the try-square. The rails ought to be shouldered on all four  sides. Three-eighths inch is a good thickness for the tenons. The width  may be 1-1/4 in. and the length 1 in.    Place the rails side by side on the bench with the joint-edges up and  the ends evened. Measure off the desired length on one of them and carry  the lines across all of them to indicate the location of the shoulder  lines. Separate the pieces and square these lines entirely around all of  the sides of each piece. With the tenon saw rip and cross cut to these  lines.    The back, it will be noted, is set on a slant to add comfort. Thoroughly  clean all the parts and assemble them, using good hot glue. Put the back  together first, then the front. After these have dried, put the side  rails in place.    Cut and fit the two cleats--one to the front rail and one to the rear  rail. Keep them even with the lower edge of the rail so as to form a  slight recess at the top when the slats are in place. This is to keep  the cushion from sliding off. The slats need not be \"let into\" the  cleats but merely fastened to their top edges. The cushion may be made  of Spanish roan skin and should be filled with elastic felt.    In the chair shown, the joints are reinforced by the addition of lag  screws. If the glue is good and the joints well fitted, these are not  necessary.          AN ARM CHAIR      The arm chair here described and illustrated is intended to be one of  the set of diners made after the design of the side chair described on  another page. The same general directions for making the side chair  apply equally to the arm chair.    The stock given in the following list should be purchased surfaced on  four sides and well sandpapered:      2 rear posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 38 in.    2 front posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 26-1/2 in.    9 rails, 7/8 by 2 by 19-1/2 in.    1 rail, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 19-1/2 in.    3 slats, 1/2 by 2 by 12-1/2 in.    2 arms, 7/8 by 4-1/2 by 20-1/2 in.    2 brackets, 7/8 by 2-1/4 by 2-1/2 in.    2 cleats, 3/8 by 1 by 19 in.    4 slats, 3/8 by 2 by 19 in.    Prepare the posts first by cutting them to the lengths shown in the  drawing. In the photograph the front posts have their tops cut off  square and the arms fastened to them by means of lag screws. A better  way from a mechanical point of view would be to shoulder the top ends on  the four sides, cut through-mortises in the arms and insert these  tenoned posts into these mortises, pinning the arm to the post by means  of small dowels in the edge of the post and through the tenon.    The brackets under the arms are to be fastened to the posts and arms by  means of concealed dowels and glue of good quality.    All of the rails should be tenoned into the posts thoroughly, even if  the lag screw fastenings are used. If the lag screws are used, the  tenons may be what are known as stubb tenons--tenons of short length.  Good hot glue should be used in either case.    The shape of the arms is indicated in the drawing. They are fastened to  the rear posts by means of dowels and glue.    [Illustration: Arm Chair Complete]    The slats, or verticals, of the back should not have their ends tenoned  but should have the mortises in the rails cut sufficiently large to \"let  in\" the whole end of each. This is much easier and more likely to result  in a satisfactory fit than to shoulder them. Any unevenness in the  lengths of the respective slats will not affect the fitting of the  joints by this latter method.    The tops of the rear posts in this chair, as in the side chair, are cut  to angles of 45 deg., beginning the slope at lines marked 1/2 in. from  the tops.    [Illustration: Details of Chair]    The bottom is made up of 2-in. slats fitted between the front and back  rails and fastened to cleats which have been previously fastened to the  insides of the front and back rails. Keep these cleats low enough on the  rails so that the top surfaces of the slats shall rest somewhat below  the top edges of the rails. Cushions, such as the one shown, can be  purchased ready made or they can be easily made by the amateur.    A good finish for this chair and its mates is obtained as follows: Apply  one coat of brown Flemish water stain. This stain in the original  package is very dark in tone and unless an almost black finish is  wanted, it should be lightened by the addition of one-half or two-thirds  water. Apply with a brush or sponge and allow to dry over night. When  dry, sandpaper lightly with fine or worn sandpaper to remove the raised  grain caused by the water of the stain. Put on a very thin coat of  shellac. This is to prevent the \"high lights\" in close-grained woods  from being discolored by the stain in the filler"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23997"],[0,"Eugene Oneguine [Onegin] (#7)"],[1,"poetic fire,  Nor wit, nor did the same inspire  A sense of social delight,  But still more stupid did appear  The gossip of their ladies fair.    XII    Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood  Lenski as a good match received,--  Such is the country custom good;  All mothers their sweet girls believed  Suitable for this semi-Russian.  He enters: rapidly discussion  Shifts, tacks about, until they prate  The sorrows of a single state.  Perchance where Dunia pours out tea  The young proprietor we find;  To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!  And a guitar produced we see,  And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:  _Come to my golden palace, dear_!(25)    [Note 25: From the lay of the _Russalka_, i.e. mermaid of the Dnieper.]    XIII    But Lenski, having no desire  Vows matrimonial to break,  With our Oneguine doth aspire  Acquaintance instantly to make.  They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,  Or ice and flame, are not diverse  If they were similar in aught.  At first such contradictions wrought  Mutual repulsion and ennui,  But grown familiar side by side  On horseback every day they ride--  Inseparable soon they be.  Thus oft--this I myself confess--  Men become friends from idleness.    XIV    But even thus not now-a-days!  In spite of common sense we're wont  As cyphers others to appraise,  Ourselves as unities to count;  And like Napoleons each of us  A million bipeds reckons thus  One instrument for his own use--  Feeling is silly, dangerous.  Eugene, more tolerant than this  (Though certainly mankind he knew  And usually despised it too),  Exceptionless as no rule is,  A few of different temper deemed,  Feeling in others much esteemed.    XV    With smiling face he Lenski hears;  The poet's fervid conversation  And judgment which unsteady veers  And eye which gleams with inspiration--  All this was novel to Eugene.  The cold reply with gloomy mien  He oft upon his lips would curb,  Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb  This evanescent boyish bliss.  Time without me will lessons give,  So meantime let him joyous live  And deem the world perfection is!  Forgive the fever youth inspires,  And youthful madness, youthful fires.    XVI    The gulf between them was so vast,  Debate commanded ample food--  The laws of generations past,  The fruits of science, evil, good,  The prejudices all men have,  The fatal secrets of the grave,  And life and fate in turn selected  Were to analysis subjected.  The fervid poet would recite,  Carried away by ecstasy,  Fragments of northern poetry,  Whilst Eugene condescending quite,  Though scarcely following what was said,  Attentive listened to the lad.    XVII    But more the passions occupy  The converse of our hermits twain,  And, heaving a regretful sigh,  An exile from their troublous reign,  Eugene would speak regarding these.  Thrice happy who their agonies  Hath suffered but indifferent grown,  Still happier he who ne'er hath known!  By absence who hath chilled his love,  His hate by slander, and who spends  Existence without wife or friends,  Whom jealous transport cannot move,  And who the rent-roll of his race  Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.    XVIII    When, wise at length, we seek repose  Beneath the flag of Quietude,  When Passion's fire no longer glows  And when her violence reviewed--  Each gust of temper, silly word,  Seems so unnatural and absurd:  Reduced with effort unto sense,  We hear with interest intense  The accents wild of other's woes,  They stir the heart as heretofore.  So ancient warriors, battles o'er,  A curious interest disclose  In yarns of youthful troopers gay,  Lost in the hamlet far away.    XIX    And in addition youth is flame  And cannot anything conceal,  Is ever ready to proclaim  The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.  Deeming himself a veteran scarred  In love's campaigns Oneguine heard  With quite a lachrymose expression  The youthful poet's fond confession.  He with an innocence extreme  His inner consciousness laid bare,  And Eugene soon discovered there  The story of his young love's dream,  Where plentifully feelings flow  Which we experienced long ago.    XX    Alas! he loved as in our times  Men love no more, as only the  Mad spirit of the man who rhymes  Is still condemned in love to be;  One image occupied his mind,  Constant affection intertwined  And an habitual sense of pain;  And distance interposed in vain,  Nor years of separation all  Nor homage which the Muse demands  Nor beauties of far distant lands  Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball  His constant soul could ever tire,  Which glowed with virginal desire.    XXI    When but a boy he Olga loved  Unknown as yet the aching heart,  He witnessed tenderly and moved  Her girlish gaiety and sport.  Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade  He with his little maiden played,  Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,  Dreamed in the future man and wife.  And full of innocent delight,  As in a thicket's humble shade,  Beneath her parents' eyes the maid  Grew like a lily pure and white,  Unseen in thick and tangled grass  By bee and butterfly which pass.    XXII    'Twas she who first within his breast  Poetic transport did infuse,  And thoughts of Olga first impressed  A mournful temper on his Muse.  Farewell! thou golden days of love!  'Twas then he loved the tangled grove  And solitude and calm delight,  The moon, the stars, and shining night--  The moon, the lamp of heaven above,  To whom we used to consecrate  A promenade in twilight late  With tears which secret sufferers love--  But now in her effulgence pale  A substitute for lamps we hail!    XXIII    Obedient she had ever been  And modest, cheerful as the morn,  As a poetic life serene,  Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.  Her eyes were of cerulean blue,  Her locks were of a golden hue,  Her movements, voice and figure slight,  All about Olga--to a light  Romance of love I pray refer,  You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;  I formerly admired her much  But finally grew bored by her.  But with her elder sister I  Must now my stanzas occupy.    XXIV    Tattiana was her appellation.  We are the first who such a name  In pages of a love narration  With such a perversity proclaim.  But wherefore not?--'Tis pleasant, nice,  Euphonious, though I know a spice  It carries of antiquity  And of the attic. Honestly,  We must admit but little taste  Doth in us or our names appear(26)  (I speak not of our poems here),  And education runs to waste,  Endowing us from out her store  With affectation,--nothing more.    [Note 26: The Russian annotator remarks: \"The most euphonious  Greek names, e.g. Agathon, Philotas, Theodora, Thekla, etc.,  are used amongst us by the lower classes only.\"]    XXV    And so Tattiana was her name,  Nor by her sister's brilliancy  Nor by her beauty she became  The cynosure of every eye.  Shy, silent did the maid appear  As in the timid forest deer,  Even beneath her parents' roof  Stood as estranged from all aloof,  Nearest and dearest knew not how  To fawn upon and love express;  A child devoid of childishness  To romp and play she ne'er would go:  Oft staring through the window pane  Would she in silence long remain.    XXVI    Contemplativeness, her delight,  E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,  Adorned with many a vision bright  Of rural life the sluggish stream;  Ne'er touched her fingers indolent  The needle nor, o'er framework bent,  Would she the canvas tight enrich  With gay design and silken stitch.  Desire to rule ye may observe  When the obedient doll in sport  An infant maiden doth exhort  Polite demeanour to preserve,  Gravely repeating to another  Recent instructions of its mother.    XXVII    But Tania ne'er displayed a passion  For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,  And gossip of the town and fashion  She ne'er repeated unto hers.  Strange unto her each childish game,  But when the winter season came  And dark and drear the evenings were,  Terrible tales she loved to hear.  And when for Olga nurse arrayed  In the broad meadow a gay rout,  All the young people round about,  At prisoner's base she never played.  Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,  Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.    XXVIII    She loved upon the balcony  To anticipate the break of day,  When on the pallid eastern sky  The starry beacons fade away,  The horizon luminous doth grow,  Morning's forerunners, breezes blow  And gradually day unfolds.  In winter, when Night longer holds  A hemisphere beneath her sway,  Longer the East inert reclines  Beneath the moon which dimly shines,  And calmly sleeps the hours away,  At the same hour she oped her eyes  And would by candlelight arise.    XXIX    Romances pleased her from the first,  Her all in all did constitute;  In love adventures she was versed,  Rousseau and Richardson to boot.  Not a bad fellow was her father  Though superannuated rather;  In books he saw nought to condemn  But, as he never opened them,  Viewed them with not a little scorn,  And gave himself but little pain  His daughter's book to ascertain  Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.  His wife was also mad upon  The works of Mr. Richardson.    XXX    She was thus fond of Richardson  Not that she had his works perused,  Or that adoring Grandison  That rascal Lovelace she abused;  But that Princess Pauline of old,  Her Moscow cousin, often told  The tale of these romantic men;  Her husband was a bridegroom then,  And she despite herself would waste  Sighs on another than her lord  Whose qualities appeared to afford  More satisfaction to her taste.  Her Grandison was in the Guard,  A noted fop who gambled hard.    XXXI    Like his, her dress was always nice,  The height of fashion, fitting tight,  But contrary to her advice  The girl in marriage they unite.  Then, her distraction to allay,  The bridegroom sage without delay  Removed her to his country seat,  Where God alone knows whom she met.  She struggled hard at first thus pent,  Night separated from her spouse,  Then became busy with the"]]]
