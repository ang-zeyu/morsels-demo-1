Then in triumph the Dwarf looked on Loki.    \"O Loki,\" he said, \"you boasted that the Dwarfs who worked for you were  better craftsmen than Sindri, my brother. Your words have been shown to  be lies. And now you cannot boast for a while.\"    Then Brock the Dwarf, with great majesty, walked out of the Council  House of Asgard, and the attending Dwarfs marched behind him in  procession. Down the passages in the earth the Dwarfs went, singing the  song of Brock's triumph over Loki. And in Svartheim it was told forever  after how Sindri and Brock had prevailed.    In Asgard, now that Loki's lips were closed, there was peace and a  respite from mischief. No one amongst the AEsir or the Vanir were sorry  when Loki had to walk about in silence with his head bent low.          [Illustration]    HOW FREYA GAINED HER NECKLACE AND HOW HER LOVED ONE WAS LOST TO HER      Yes, Loki went through Asgard silent and with head bent, and the  Dwellers in Asgard said one unto the other, \"This will teach Loki to  work no more mischief.\" They did not know that what Loki had done had  sown the seeds of mischief and that these seeds were to sprout up and  bring sorrow to the beautiful Vana Freya, to Freya whom the Giant wanted  to carry off with the Sun and the Moon as payment for his building the  wall around Asgard.    Freya had looked upon the wonders that Loki had brought into Asgard--the  golden threads that were Sif's hair, and Frey's boar that shed light  from its bristles as it flew. The gleam of these golden things dazzled  her, and made her dream in the day time and the night time of the  wonders that she herself might possess. And often she thought, \"What  wonderful things the Three Giant Women would give me if I could bring  myself to go to them on their mountaintop.\"    Long ere this, when the wall around their City was not yet built, and  when the Gods had set up only the court with their twelve seats and the  Hall that was for Odin and the Hall that was for the Goddesses, there  had come into Asgard Three Giant Women.    They came after the Gods had set up a forge and had begun to work metal  for their buildings. The metal they worked was pure gold. With gold they  built Gladsheim, the Hall of Odin, and with gold they made all their  dishes and household ware. Then was the Age of Gold, and the Gods did  not grudge gold to anyone. Happy were the Gods then, and no shadow nor  foreboding lay on Asgard.    But after the Three Giant Women came the Gods began to value gold and to  hoard it. They played with it no more. And the happy innocence of their  first days departed from them.    At last the Three were banished from Asgard. The Gods turned their  thoughts from the hoarding of gold, and they built up their City, and  they made themselves strong.    And now Freya, the lovely Vanir bride, thought upon the Giant Women and  on the wonderful things of gold they had flashed through their hands.  But not to Odur, her husband, did she speak her thoughts; for Odur, more  than any of the other dwellers in Asgard, was wont to think on the days  of happy innocence, before gold came to be hoarded and valued. Odur  would not have Freya go near the mountaintop where the Three had their  high seat.    But Freya did not cease to think upon them and upon the things of gold  they had. \"Why should Odur know I went to them?\" she said to herself.  \"No one will tell him. And what difference will it make if I go to them  and gain some lovely thing for myself? I shall not love Odur the less  because I go my own way for once.\"    Then one day she left their palace, leaving Odur, her husband, playing  with their little child Hnossa. She left the palace and went down to the  Earth. There she stayed for a while, tending the flowers that were her  charge. After a while she asked the Elves to tell her where the mountain  was on which the Three Giant Women stayed.    The Elves were frightened and would not tell her, although she was queen  over them. She left them and stole down into the caves of the Dwarfs. It  was they who showed her the way to the seat of the Giant Women, but  before they showed her the way they made her feel shame and misery.    \"We will show you the way if you stay with us here,\" said one of the  Dwarfs.    \"For how long would you have me stay?\" said Freya.    \"Until the cocks in Svartheim crow,\" said the Dwarfs, closing round her.  \"We want to know what the company of one of the Vanir is like.\" \"I will  stay,\" Freya said.    Then one of the Dwarfs reached up and put his arms round her neck and  kissed her with his ugly mouth. Freya tried to break away from them, but  the Dwarfs held her. \"You cannot go away from us now until the cocks of  Svartheim crow,\" they said.    Then one and then another of the Dwarfs pressed up to her and kissed  her. They made her sit down beside them on the heaps of skins they had.  When she wept they screamed at her and beat her. One, when she would not  kiss him on the mouth, bit her hands. So Freya stayed with the Dwarfs  until the cocks of Svartheim crew.    They showed her the mountain on the top of which the Three banished from  Asgard had their abode. The Giant Women sat overlooking the World of  Men. \"What would you have from us, wife of Odur?\" one who was called  Gulveig said to her.    \"Alas! Now that I have found you I know that I should ask you for  nought,\" Freya said.    \"Speak, Vana,\" said the second of the Giant Women.    The third said nothing, but she held up in her hands a necklace of gold  most curiously fashioned. \"How bright it is!\" Freya said. \"There is  shadow where you sit, women, but the necklace you hold makes brightness  now. Oh, how I should joy to wear it!\"    \"It is the necklace Brisingamen,\" said the one who was called Gulveig.    \"It is yours to wear, wife of Odur,\" said the one who held it in her  hands.    Freya took the shining necklace and clasped it round her throat. She  could not bring herself to thank the Giant Women, for she saw that  there was evil in their eyes. She made reverence to them, however, and  she went from the mountain on which they sat overlooking the World of  Men.    In a while she looked down and saw Brisingamen and her misery went from  her. It was the most beautiful thing ever made by hands. None of the  Asyniur and none other of the Vanir possessed a thing so beautiful. It  made her more and more lovely, and Odur, she thought, would forgive her  when he saw how beautiful and how happy Brisingamen made her.    She rose up from amongst the flowers and took leave of the slight Elves  and she made her way into Asgard. All who greeted her looked long and  with wonder upon the necklace that she wore. And into the eyes of the  Goddesses there came a look of longing when they saw Brisingamen.    But Freya hardly stopped to speak to anyone. As swiftly as she could she  made her way to her own palace. She would show herself to Odur and win  his forgiveness. She entered her shining palace and called to him. No  answer came. Her child, the little Hnossa, was on the floor, playing.  Her mother took her in her arms, but the child, when she looked on  Brisingamen, turned away crying.    Freya left Hnossa down and searched again for Odur. He was not in any  part of their palace. She went into the houses of all who dwelt in  Asgard, asking for tidings of him. None knew where he had gone to. At  last Freya went back to their palace and waited and waited for Odur to  return. But Odur did not come.    One came to her. It was a Goddess, Odin's wife, the queenly Frigga. \"You  are waiting for Odur, your husband,\" Frigga said. \"Ah, let me tell you  Odur will not come to you here. He went, when for the sake of a shining  thing you did what would make him unhappy. Odur has gone from Asgard and  no one knows where to search for him.\"    \"I will seek him outside of Asgard,\" Freya said. She wept no more, but  she took the little child Hnossa and put her in Frigga's arms. Then she  mounted her car that was drawn by two cats, and journeyed down from  Asgard to Midgard, the Earth, to search for Odur her husband.    Year in and year out, and over all the Earth, Freya went searching and  calling for the lost Odur. She went as far as the bounds of the Earth,  where she could look over to Joetunheim, where dwelt the Giant who would  have carried her off with the Sun and the Moon as payment for the  building of the wall around Asgard. But in no place, from the end of the  Rainbow Bifroest, that stretched from Asgard to the Earth, to the  boundary of Joetunheim, did she find a trace of her husband Odur.    At last she turned her car toward Bifroest, the Rainbow Bridge that  stretched from Midgard, the Earth, to Asgard, the Dwelling of the Gods.  Heimdall, the Watcher for the Gods, guarded the Rainbow Bridge. To him  Freya went with a half hope fluttering in her heart.    \"O Heimdall,\" she cried, \"O Heimdall, Watcher for the Gods, speak and  tell me if you know where Odur is.\"    \"Odur is in every place where the searcher has not come; Odur is in  every place that the searcher has left; those who seek him will never  find Odur,\" said Heimdall, the Watcher for the Gods.    Then Freya stood on Bifroest and wept. Frigga, the queenly Goddess, heard  the sound of her weeping, and came out of Asgard to comfort her.    \"Ah, what comfort can you give me, Frigga?\" cried Freya. \"What comfort  can you give me when Odur will never be found by one who searches for  him?\"    \"Behold how your daughter, the child Hnossa, has grown,\" said Frigga.  Freya looked up and saw a beautiful maiden standing on Bifroest, the  Rainbow Bridge. She was young, more youthful than any of the Vanir or  the Asyniur, and her face and her form were so lovely that all hearts  became melted when they looked upon her.    And Freya was comforted in her loss. She followed Frigga across Bifroest,  the Rainbow Bridge, and came once again into the City of the Gods. In  her own palace in Asgard Freya dwelt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24750"],[0,"Mizora: A Prophecy (#7)"],[1,"vital  reason, was their system of free education. In contemplating the state  of enlightenment to which Mizora had attained, I became an enthusiast  upon the subject of education, and resolved, should I ever again reach  the upper world, to devote all my energies and ability to convincing the  governments of its importance. I believe it is the duty of every  government to make its schools and colleges, and everything appertaining  to education--FREE. To be always starved for knowledge is a more pitiful  craving than to hunger for bread. One dwarfs the body; the other the  mind.    The utmost care was bestowed upon the training and education of the  children. There was nothing that I met with in that beautiful and happy  country I longed more to bring with me to the inhabitants of my world,  than their manner of rearing children. The most scrupulous attention was  paid to their diet and exercise, both mental and physical. The result  was plump limbs, healthy, happy faces and joyous spirits. In all the  fifteen years that I spent in Mizora, I never saw a tear of sorrow fall  from children's eyes. Admirable sanitary regulations exist in all the  cities and villages of the land, which insures them pure air. I may  state here that every private-house looks as carefully to the condition  of its atmosphere, as we do to the material neatness of ours.    The only intense feeling that I could discover among these people was  the love between parent and child. I visited the theater where the  tragedy of the play was the destruction of a daughter by shipwreck in  view of the distracted mother. The scenery was managed with wonderful  realism. The thunder of the surf as it beat upon the shore, the  frightful carnival of wind and waves that no human power could still,  and the agony of the mother watching the vessel break to pieces upon the  rock and her child sink into the boiling water to rise no more, was  thrilling beyond my power to describe. I lost control of my feelings.  The audience wept and applauded; and when the curtain fell, I could  scarcely believe it had only been a play. The love of Mizora women for  their children is strong and deep. They consider the care of them a  sacred duty, fraught with the noblest results of life. A daughter of  scholarly attainments and noble character is a credit to her mother.  That selfish mother who looks upon her children as so many afflictions  is unknown to Mizora. If a mother should ever feel her children as  burdens upon her, she would never give it expression, as any dereliction  of duty would be severely rebuked by the whole community, if not  punished by banishment. Corporal punishment was unknown.    I received an invitation from a lady prominent in literature and science  to make her a visit. I accepted with gratification, as it would afford  me the opportunity I coveted to become acquainted with the domestic life  of Mizora, and perhaps penetrate its greatest mystery, for I must  confess that the singular dearth of anything and everything resembling  Man, never ceased to prey upon my curiosity.    The lady was the editor and proprietor of the largest and most widely  known scientific and literary magazine in the country. She was the  mother of eight children, and possessed one of the largest fortunes and  most magnificent residences in the country.    The house stood on an elevation, and was a magnificent structure of grey  granite, with polished cornices. The porch floors were of clouded  marble. The pillars supporting its roof were round shafts of the same  material, with vines of ivy, grape and rose winding about them, carved  and colored into perfect representations of the natural shrubs.    The drawing-room, which was vast and imposing in size and appearance,  had a floor of pure white marble. The mantels and window-sills were of  white onyx, with delicate vinings of pink and green. The floor was  strewn with richly colored mats and rugs. Luxurious sofas and chairs  comprised the only furniture. Each corner contained a piece of fine  statuary. From the centre of the ceiling depended a large gold basin of  beautiful design and workmanship, in which played a miniature fountain  of perfumed water that filled the air with a delicate fragrance. The  walls were divided into panels of polished and unpolished granite. On  the unpolished panels hung paintings of scenery. The dull, gray color of  the walls brought out in sharp and tasteful relief the few costly and  elegant adornments of the room: a placid landscape with mountains dimly  outlining the distance. A water scene with a boat idly drifting,  occupied by a solitary figure watching the play of variegated lights  upon the tranquil waters. Then came a wild and rugged mountain scene  with precipices and a foaming torrent. Then a concert of birds amusingly  treated.    The onyx marble mantel-piece contained but a single ornament--an  orchestra. A coral vase contained a large and perfect tiger lily, made  of gold. Each stamen supported a tiny figure carved out of ivory,  holding a musical instrument. When they played, each figure appeared  instinct with life, like the mythical fairies of my childhood; and the  music was so sweet, yet faint, that I readily imagined the charmed ring  and tiny dancers keeping time to its rhythm.    The drawing-room presented a vista of arches draped in curtains of a  rare texture, though I afterward learned they were spun glass. The one  that draped the entrance to the conservatory looked like sea foam with  the faint blush of day shining through it. The conservatory was in the  shape of a half sphere, and entirely of glass. From its dome, more than  a hundred feet above our heads, hung a globe of white fire that gave  forth a soft clear light. Terminating, as it did, the long vista of  arches with their transparent hangings of cobweb texture, it presented a  picture of magnificence and beauty indescribably.    The other apartments displayed the same taste and luxury. The  sitting-room contained an instrument resembling a grand piano.    The grounds surrounding this elegant home were adorned with natural and  artificial beauties, Grottoes, fountains, lakes, cascades, terraces of  flowers, statuary, arbors and foliage in endless variety, that rendered  it a miniature paradise. In these grounds, darting in and out among the  avenues, playing hide-and-seek behind the statuary, or otherwise amusing  themselves, I met eight lovely children, ranging from infancy to young  maidenhood. The glowing cheeks and eyes, and supple limbs spoke of  perfect health and happiness. When they saw their mother coming, they  ran to meet her, the oldest carrying the two-year old baby. The stately  woman greeted each with a loving kiss. She showed in loving glance and  action how dear they all were to her. For the time being she unbent,  and became a child herself in the interest she took in their prattle and  mirth. A true mother and happy children.    I discovered that each department of this handsome home was under the  care of a professional artist. I remarked to my hostess that I had  supposed her home was the expression of her own taste.    \"So it is,\" she replied; \"but it requires an equally well educated taste  to carry out my designs. The arrangement and ornamentation of my grounds  were suggested by me, and planned and executed by my landscape artist.\"    After supper we repaired to the general sitting-room. The eldest  daughter had been deeply absorbed in a book before we came in. She  closed and left it upon a table. I watched for an opportunity to  carelessly pick it up and examine it. It was a novel I felt sure, for  she appeared to resign it reluctantly out of courtesy to her guest. I  might, from it, gather some clue to the mystery of the male sex. I took  up the book and opened it. It was The Conservation of Force and The  Phenomena of Nature. I laid it down with a sigh of discomfiture.    The next evening, my hostess gave a small entertainment, and what was my  amazement, not to say offense, to perceive the cook, the chamber-maid,  and in fact all the servants in the establishment, enter and join in the  conversation and amusement. The cook was asked to sing, for, with the  exception of myself--and I tried to conceal it--no one appeared to take  umbrage at her presence. She sat down to the piano and sang a pretty  ballad in a charming manner. Her voice was cultivated and musical, as  are all the voices in Mizora, but it was lacking in the qualities that  make a great singer, yet it had a plaintive sweetness that was very  attractive.    I was dumbfounded at her presumption. In my country such a thing is  unknown as a servant entertaining guests in such a capacity, and  especially among people of my rank and position in the world.    I repelled some advances she made me with a hauteur and coldness that it  mortified me afterward to remember. Instead of being _my_ inferior, I  was her's, and she knew it; but neither by look, tone nor action did she  betray her consciousness of it. I had to acknowledge that her hands were  more delicately modeled than mine, and her bearing had a dignity and  elegance that might have been envied by the most aristocratic dame of my  own land. Knowing that the Mizora people were peculiar in their social  ideas, I essayed to repress my indignation at the time, but later I  unburdened myself to Wauna who, with her usual sweetness and  gentleness, explained to me that her occupation was a mere matter of  choice with her.    \"She is one of the most distinguished chemists of this nation. She  solved the problem of making bread out of limestone of a much finer  quality than had been in use before.\"    \"Don't tell me that you gave me a stone when I asked for bread!\" I  exclaimed.    \"We have not done that,\" replied Wauna; \"but we have given you what you  took for bread, but which is manufactured out of limestone and the  refuse of the marble quarries.\"    I looked at"]]]
