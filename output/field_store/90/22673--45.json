For since the spirit is neither slain, nor  deprived of power, by destruction of the body, or by severance from the  body, it may find another to dwell in. Spirits of dead men, like other  spirits, may assume fresh bodies, new forms, and forms not necessarily  human. A favourite form is that of a snake: it was as a snake that the  spirit of Anchises appeared and accepted the offerings made by his pious  son. In their new forms the spirits of the dead are sometimes, as in  this case, kindly, at other times malicious, but always to be treated  with respect, always to be conciliated; for their power is great. They  can in their turn cause disease, misfortune, death.    Another characteristic of the mental condition I am describing must not  be omitted. Connection of thought, even though purely fortuitous, is  taken to indicate actual connection of the things represented in  thought. This connection is, of course, often founded on association of  time or place, and once formed it is not easily broken. For example, any  object once belonging to a man recalls the thought of him. The  connection between him and that object is therefore looked upon as still  existing, and he may be affected by the conduct shown towards it. This  applies with special force to such objects as articles of clothing, and  still more to footprints and to spittle, hair, nail-parings and  excrement. Injury to these with malicious intent will hurt him from whom  they are derived. In the same way a personal name is looked upon as  inseparable from its owner; and savages are frequently careful to guard  the knowledge of their true names from others, being content to be  addressed and spoken of by a nickname, or a substituted epithet. The  reason of this is that the knowledge of another's name confers power  over that other: it is as though he, or at least an essential part of  him, were in the possession of the person who had obtained the knowledge  of his name. It is perhaps not an unfair deduction from the same  premises that endows an image with the properties of its prototype--nay,  identifies it with its prototype. This leads on the one hand to  idol-worship, and on the other hand to the rites of witchcraft wherein  the wizard is said to make a figure of a man, call it by his name, and  then transfix it with nails or thorns, or burn it, with the object of  causing pain and ultimately death to the person represented. Nor is a  very different process of thought discernible in the belief that by  eating human or other flesh the spirit (or at any rate some of the  spiritual qualities) formerly animating it can be transferred to the  eater. So a brave enemy is devoured in the hope of acquiring his  bravery; and a pregnant woman is denied the flesh of hares and other  animals whose qualities it is undesirable her children should have.    To minds guiltless of inductive reasoning an accidental coincidence is a  sure proof of cause and effect. Travellers' tales are full of examples  of misfortunes quite beyond foresight or control, but attributed by the  savages among whom the narrators have sojourned to some perfectly  innocent act on their part, or merely to their presence, or to some  strange article of their equipment. Occasionally the anger of the gods  is aroused by these things; and missionaries, in particular, have  suffered much on this account. But sometimes a more direct causation is  imagined, though it is probably not always easy to distinguish the two  cases. Omens also are founded upon accidental coincidences. The most  lively imagination may fail to trace cause and effect between the  meeting of a magpie at setting out and a fruitless errand following, or  between a certain condition of the entrails of an animal sacrificed and  a victory or defeat thereafter. But the imagination is not to be beaten  thus. If the magpie did not cause failure, at all events it foretold it;  and the look of the entrails was an omen of the gain or loss of the  battle.    Again, a merely fanciful resemblance is a sufficient association to  establish actual connection. Why do the Bushmen kindle great fires in  time of drought, if not because of the similarity in appearance between  smoke and rain-clouds? Such resemblances, to give a familiar instance,  have fastened on certain rocks and stones many legends of transformation  in conformity with the belief already discussed; and they account for a  vast variety of symbolism in the rites and ceremonies of nations all  over the world.    The topic is well nigh endless; but enough has been said to enable the  reader to see how widely pervasive in human affairs is the belief in  real connection founded on nothing more substantial than association of  thought, however occasioned. Nothing, indeed, is too absurd for this  belief. It is one of the most fruitful causes of superstition; and it  only disappears very gradually from the higher civilization as the  reasoning powers become more and more highly trained. In magic, or  witchcraft, we find it developed into a system, with professional  ministers and well-established rules. By these rules its ministers  declare themselves able to perform all the wonders of transformation  referred to above, to command spirits, to bring distant persons and  things into their immediate presence, to inflict injury and death upon  whom they please, to bestow wealth and happiness, and to foretell the  future. The terror they have thus inspired, and the horrors wrought  under the influence of that terror, form one of the saddest chapters of  history.[14]    I do not of course pretend that the foregoing is a complete account of  the mental processes of savage peoples. Still less have I attempted to  trace the history of the various characteristics mentioned, or to show  the order of their evolution. To attempt either of these things would  be beyond the scope of the present work. I have simply enumerated a few  of the elements in the psychology of men in a low state of culture which  it is needful to bear in mind in order to understand the stories we are  about to examine. In those stories we shall find many impossibilities,  many absurdities and many traces of customs repulsive to our modes of  thought and foreign to our manners. The explanation is to be obtained,  not by speculations based on far-fetched metaphors supposed to have  existed in the speech of early races, nor in philological puzzles, but  by soberly inquiring into the facts of barbarian and savage life and  into the psychological phenomena of which the facts are the outcome. The  evidence of these facts and phenomena is to be found scattered up and  down the pages of writers of every age, creed and country. On hardly any  subject have men of such different degrees of learning, such various and  opposite prejudices, left us their testimony--testimony from the nature  of the subject more than ordinarily liable to be affected by prejudice,  and by the limitations of each witness's powers of observation and  opportunities of ascertaining the truth. But after all deductions for  prejudice, mistake, inaccuracy and every other shortcoming, there is  left a strong, an invincible consensus of testimony, honest, independent  and full of undesigned corroborations, to the development of the mind of  all races in the lower culture along the lines here indicated. Nay,  more; the numerous remains of archaic institutions, as well as of  beliefs among the most advanced nations, prove that they too have passed  through the very same stages in which we find the most backward still  lingering--stages which the less enlightened classes even of our own  countrymen at the present day are loth to quit. And the further we  penetrate in these investigations, the more frequent and striking are  the coincidences between the mental phenomena already described which  are still manifested by savage peoples, and those of which the evidence  has not yet disappeared from our own midst.    Nor need we be surprised at this, for the root whence all these  phenomena spring is the predominance of imagination over reason in the  uncivilized. Man, while his experience is limited to a small tract of  earth, and his life is divided between a struggle with nature and his  fellow-man for the permission and the means to live, on the one hand,  and seasons of idleness, empty perforce of every opportunity and every  desire for improving his condition, on the other, cannot acquire the  materials of a real knowledge of his physical environment. His only data  for interpreting the world and the objects it contains, so far as he is  acquainted with them, are his own consciousness and his own emotions.  Upon these his drafts are unbounded; and if he have any curiosity about  the origin and government of things, his hypotheses take the shape of  tales in which the actors, whatever form they bear, are essentially  himself in motive and deed, but magnified and distorted to meet his  wishes or his fears, or the conditions of the problem as presented to  his limited vision. The thought which is the measure of his universe is  as yet hardly disciplined by anything beyond his passions.    Nor does the predominance of the imagination issue only in these tales  and in songs--the two modes of expression we most readily attribute to  the imagination. In practical life it issues in superstitious  observances, and in social and political institutions. Social  institutions are sometimes of great complexity, even in the depth of  savagery. Together with political institutions they supply the model on  which are framed man's ideas of the relationship to one another and to  himself of the supernatural beings whom he creates; and in turn they  reflect"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24616"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Southwark Cathedral (#7)"],[1,"desired), under a penalty of  4_d._ It is fair to add that they were alive to their responsibilities  as they understood them, _e.g._, on 3rd March, 1571, they gave the  clerk warning, and appointed another in his place who was \"a good bass  and tenor,\" at a salary of L1 6_s._ 8_d._, \"that the choir might be  better served.\"    [7] The viscera of his successor, Bishop Horne, are also said to have  been buried at St. Mary's in 1579.    [8] We have a striking illustration of the joint pastorate at the same  period, when the judicious Hooker was Master of the Temple, and Mr.  Travers the Lecturer. The result was that \"the forenoon sermon spake  Canterbury, and the afternoon Geneva.\"--Walton's \"Life of Hooker.\"    Another instance of this difference of opinion comes before us at St.  Saviour's itself. Dr. Thomas Sutton, who was appointed Chaplain there  in 1615, was an ardent denouncer of plays and players, of whose  iniquities he was constantly reminded by the Globe and other theatres  in the neighbourhood. His superior, Dr. Lancelot Andrewes, on the other  hand, does not scruple to draw freely on the theatre for his  illustrations. See for example Bishop Andrewes' sermon on St. Matt.  vii, 6, preached before James I on Ash Wednesday, 1622.    [9] It may be mentioned, as throwing some light on the above, that the  Bankside had acquired an evil reputation through the brothels and other  iniquities tolerated in that quarter, and more or less recognised in  the Acts of Parliament for their regulation. The north side of a church  was in the Middle Ages usually appropriated to women, as inferior to  the south, which was reserved for the opposite sex. The north side of  the churchyard was used for the burial of ordinary people, a fact which  explains St. Swithun's humility in choosing it for his own  resting-place.    [10] His words are these: \"Supposing Hollar's and other views of the  church (in which buttresses at the angles of the tower are shown) to be  correct, the buttresses as well as the pinnacles were then removed.\"    [11] The space was eventually left at 130 feet, as it now stands.    [12] Mr. Dollman, who probably knew more about the ancient fabric than  any living man, was heard to express his regret that his own great age  prevented his active co-operation, but he was delighted that the work  of restoration had fallen to such competent hands.       [Illustration: _Photo._     _G.P. Heisch._     THE CATHEDRAL FROM THE SOUTH-WEST.]          CHAPTER II    THE EXTERIOR      At the present day St. Saviour's Cathedral is most unfortunate in its  surroundings, and cannot be seen as a whole from any point, near or  distant. Hemmed in as the church is by London Bridge on the east, the  Borough Market and railway arches on the south, and by tall warehouses  on the other sides, the confined space in which it stands is a decided  hindrance to the near perspective, while the surrounding buildings  shut off the view from a distance in all directions.[13]    The railway line from Cannon Street commands a fairly good prospect  from the south-west, as it passes the church in its course. A closer  prospect is to be obtained from the London Bridge approach which takes  in the Lady Chapel, the east and south sides of the choir, the tower  and south transept. A few yards further up the slope we, of course,  lose the south aspect, but get a fair view, from the north-east  corner, of part of the east front and the north transept, including  the new Harvard window in the chapel beneath it. If we descend the  short flight of steps at the foot of the bridge, and take up a  position in the south-east corner of the open ground outside the  church railings, we get a fairly good view of the south side from the  Lady Chapel to the south-west porch, but lose sight of much of the  east end, and therefore of one of the most characteristic external  features.    The church lies in a general east and west direction, and is cruciform  in plan, consisting of a nave, north and south transepts, a central  tower, and choir, beyond which is the retro-choir, or so-called Lady  Chapel. The nave and choir have aisles, but the transepts have not.  While strict orientation has been secured in the main building, it  will be noticed that the chancel is slightly deflected towards the  south, in supposed mystic allusion to the drooping head of the Saviour  upon the Cross, a piece of symbolism very frequent in Gothic churches,  and here rendered peculiarly appropriate by the dedication.[14]    Starting our perambulation at the =East End=, it will be noticed that  the so-called Lady Chapel is actually an enlargement of the choir,  such as we find on a much grander scale at Durham or Fountains, and  may be compared to the \"Presbytery\" at Chichester, from which the Lady  Chapel projects, or to the \"New Building\" at Peterborough Cathedral.  This addition was made to the church by Peter de Rupibus in the  thirteenth century, as a retro-choir or ambulatory. It was carefully  restored by Mr. George Gwilt, in 1832, from much external mutilation  to something like its original state. The eastern side consists of  four bays, divided by buttresses, and surmounted by pointed gables,  with ornamental crosses on the apices. In each of the gables there is  a triplet of narrow lancet windows, which light the space between the  internal vault and the roof. They have sculptured heads in the  moulding above the central light in each triplet. The bays below are  lighted by a similar series of larger windows of simpler  construction, the moulding of the sides being carried over the lancet  points in unbroken continuity. In the north-east corner there is a  short hexagonal stair turret, but the opposite corner is simply  supported by ordinary buttresses. The walls are made up of rubble and  flints, with ashlar dressing, as is supposed to have been the case  throughout the original church, where, however, the flints are said to  have been squared. In the reign of Edward III, a small Lady Chapel was  built against the east end of this retro-choir: it projected from the  second bay from the south, where the window was removed to connect it  with the church. After the interment of Bishop Andrewes within it,  this little appendage became popularly known as the \"Bishop's Chapel.\"  It was demolished in 1830, on the ground of its supposed interference  with the approach to the new London Bridge; but as it only projected  thirty-four feet (a distance which would have placed it well within  the present churchyard railing) its destruction seems to have been an  unnecessary act of vandalism. The retro-choir itself narrowly escaped  sharing its fate, but was fortunately spared, and the tomb of Bishop  Andrewes was removed to its present position immediately behind the  high altar. The true Lady Chapel being destroyed, the dedication seems  to have been popularly transferred to the structure so closely  associated with it, and most people concerned are now very unwilling  to part with the familiar name.[15]    Above the Lady Chapel, as it is now called, we have a view of the  =East End of the Choir=, as restored by Mr. Gwilt at the same time.  This part of the church having been considerably altered by Bishop  Fox, in or about the year 1520, the restoring architect, though  anxious to go back to the thirteenth century work, had scarcely any  data to guide him to its reproduction. The result was the more or less  original elevation that we now see. It consists of a three-light  lancet window at the east end of the choir, with a small circular  window, with seven cusps, in the gable above, surmounted by a cross,  and a stair-turret, terminating in an octagonal pinnacle at each end  of the elevation.[16]    The pitch of Mr. Gwilt's gable was below that of its predecessor; but  with this exception (the responsibility for which lies rather with the  building committee than with him) his work must be considered very  satisfactory. His body now lies at rest in the family vault in the  south-east corner outside his work, and he is commemorated in a window  within, as well as in a marble tablet behind the altar-screen.    The =South side of the Lady Chapel= contains a central window of three  lights and geometrical tracery, with a lancet window on the right and  left. The mouldings of these side windows are not exactly alike, that  on the right (of the spectator) being extremely plain, while the other  is supported by slender shafts, terminating in delicate floral  capitals.    This aspect of the chapel was completely hidden by the parish church  of St. Mary Magdalene Overy, erected against it in the thirteenth  century, and destroyed in 1822, after having undergone many  alterations. The choir entrance, at the intersection of the choir and  south transept, is not remarkable, and need not detain us.    The =South Transept=, which has a public doorway on its eastern side,  was erected, with its companion on the north, in the first half of the  fourteenth century (_circa_ 1300-1350) in the Decorated style of that  period. It was rebuilt by Cardinal Beaufort in the following century,  which accounts for certain architectural differences between the two  transepts, chiefly noticeable in the windows and in the interior  walls. The front of this transept was repaired in brick in 1735, and  the restoration of both was taken in hand by Mr. Wallace in 1830. At  the earlier date the original window in the south elevation was  \"enlarged and beautified,\" which means that the tracery was taken out,  and a cheap substitute inserted, without tracery, and with plain  mullions instead of the original elaborate lights. Mr. Wallace  improved upon this feeble design by introducing another window, on a  pattern partly of his own invention, partly based on a circular window  in the adjacent Winchester Palace, which is said to have been  singularly ill adapted for stained glass.
