[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],[0,"Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#7)"],[1,"don't expect a swallow to look round a corner before he goes round it;  he must take his chance. The main point is that he may be able to stop  himself, and turn, in a moment.    47. The stopping, on any terms, is difficult enough to understand; nor  less so, the original gaining of the pace. We always think of flight as  if the main difficulty of it were only in keeping up in the air;--but  the buoyancy is conceivable enough, the far more wonderful matter is  the getting along. You find it hard work to row yourself at anything  like speed, though your impulse-stroke is given in a heavy element, and  your return-stroke in a light one. But both in birds and fishes, the  impelling stroke and its return are in the same element; and if, for  the bird, that medium yields easily to its impulses, it secedes as  easily from the blow that gives it. And if you think what an effort you  make to leap six feet, with the earth for a fulcrum, the dart either of  a trout or a swallow, with no fulcrum but the water and air they  penetrate, will seem to you, I think, greatly marvelous. Yet of the  mode in which it is accomplished you will as yet find no undisputed  account in any book on natural history, and scarcely, as far as I know,  definite notice even of the rate of flight. What do you suppose it is?  We are apt to think of the migration of a swallow, as we should  ourselves of a serious journey. How long, do you think, it would take  him, if he flew uninterruptedly, to get from here to Africa?    48. Michelet gives the rate of his flight (at full speed, of course,)  as eighty leagues an hour. I find no more sound authority; but do not  doubt his approximate accuracy;[10] still how curious and how  provoking it is that neither White of Selborne, Bewick, Yarrell, nor  Gould, says a word about this, one should have thought the most  interesting, power of the bird.[11]          [10] I wrote this some time ago, and the endeavors I have since        made to verify statements on points of natural history which I        had taken on trust have given me reason to doubt everybody's        accuracy. The ordinary flight of the swallow does not, assuredly,        even in the dashes, reach anything like this speed.          [11] Incidentally suggestive sentences occur in the history of        Selborne, but its author never comes to the point, in this case.    Taking Michelet's estimate--eighty French leagues, roughly two hundred  and fifty miles, an hour--we have a thousand miles in four hours. That  is to say, leaving Devonshire after an early breakfast, he could be in  Africa to lunch.    49. He could, I say, if his flight were constant; but though there is  much inconsistency in the accounts, the sum of testimony seems definite  that the swallow is among the most fatiguable of birds. \"When the  weather is hazy,\" (I quote Yarrell) \"they will alight on fishing-boats  a league or two from land, so tired that when any one tries to catch  them, they can scarcely fly from one end of the boat to the other.\"    I have no time to read to you the interesting evidence on this point  given by Yarrell, but only that of the brother of White of Selborne, at  Gibraltar. \"My brother has always found,\" he himself writes, \"that some  of his birds, and particularly the swallow kind, are very sparing of  their pains in crossing the Mediterranean; for when arrived at  Gibraltar, they do not 'set forth their airy caravan, high over seas,'  but scout and hurry along in little detached parties of six or seven in  a company; and sweeping low, just over the surface of the land and  water, direct their course to the opposite continent at the narrowest  passage they can find.\"    50. You will observe, however, that it remains an open question whether  this fear of sea may not be, in the swallow, like ours of the desert.  The commissariat department is a serious one for birds that eat a  thousand flies a day when just out of the egg; and it is possible that  the weariness of swallows at sea may depend much more on fasting than  flying. Captain (or Admiral?) Sir Charles Wager says that \"one  spring-time, as he came into soundings in the English Channel, a great  flock of swallows came and settled on all his rigging; every rope was  covered; they hung on one another like a swarm of bees; even the decks  were filled with them. They seemed almost famished and spent, and were  only feathers and bone; but, being recruited with a night's rest, took  their flight in the morning.\"    51. Now I detain you on this point somewhat, because it is intimately  connected with a more important one. I told you we should learn from  the swallow what a wing was. Few other birds approach him in the beauty  of it, or apparent power. And yet, after all this care taken about it,  he gets tired; and instead of flying, as we should do in his place, all  over the world, and tasting the flavor of the midges in every marsh  which the infinitude of human folly has left to breed gnats instead of  growing corn,--he is of all birds, characteristically, except when he  absolutely can't help it, the stayer at home; and contentedly lodges  himself and his family in an old chimney, when he might be flying all  over the world.    At least you would think, if he built in an English chimney this year,  he would build in a French one next. But no. Michelet prettily says of  him, \"He is the bird of return.\" If you will only treat him kindly,  year after year, he comes back to the same niche, and to the same  hearth, for his nest.    To the same niche; and builds himself an opaque walled house within  that. Think of this a little, as if you heard of it for the first time.    52. Suppose you had never seen a swallow; but that its general habit  of life had been described to you, and you had been asked, how you  thought such a bird would build its nest. A creature, observe, whose  life is to be passed in the air; whose beak and throat are shaped  with the fineness of a net for the catching of gnats; and whose feet,  in the most perfect of the species, are so feeble that it is called  the Footless Swallow, and cannot stand a moment on the ground with  comfort. Of all land birds, the one that has least to do with the  earth; of all, the least disposed, and the least able, to stop to  pick anything up. What will it build with? Gossamer, we should  say,--thistledown,--anything it can catch floating, like flies.    But it builds with stiff clay.    53. And observe its chosen place for building also. You would think, by  its play in the air, that not only of all birds, but of all creatures,  it most delighted in space and freedom. You would fancy its notion of  the place for a nest would be the openest field it could find; that  anything like confinement would be an agony to it; that it would almost  expire of horror at the sight of a black hole.    And its favorite home is down a chimney.    54. Not for your hearth's sake, nor for your company's. Do not think  it. The bird will love you if you treat it kindly; is as frank and  friendly as bird can be; but it does not, more than others, seek your  society. It comes to your house because in no wild wood, nor rough  rock, can it find a cavity close enough to please it. It comes for the  blessedness of imprisonment, and the solemnity of an unbroken and  constant shadow, in the tower, or under the eaves.    Do you suppose that this is part of its necessary economy, and that a  swallow could not catch flies unless it lived in a hole?    Not so. This instinct is part of its brotherhood with another race of  creatures. It is given to complete a mesh in the reticulation of the  orders of life.    55. I have already given you several reasons for my wish that you  should retain, in classifying birds, the now rejected order of Picae. I  am going to read you a passage from Humboldt, which shows you what  difficulties one may get into for want of it.    You will find in the second volume of his personal narrative, an  account of the cave of Caripe in New Andalusia, which is inhabited by  entirely nocturnal birds, having the gaping mouths of the goat-sucker  and the swallow, and yet feeding on fruit.    Unless, which Mr. Humboldt does not tell us, they sit under the trees  outside, in the night time, and hold their mouths open, for the berries  to drop into, there is not the smallest occasion for their having wide  mouths, like swallows. Still less is there any need, since they are  fruit eaters, for their living in a cavern 1,500 feet out of daylight.  They have only, in consequence, the trouble of carrying in the seeds to  feed their young, and the floor of the cave is thus covered, by the  seeds they let fall, with a growth of unfortunate pale plants, which  have never seen day. Nay, they are not even content with the darkness  of their cave; but build their nests in the funnels with which the roof  of the grotto is pierced like a sieve; live actually in the chimney,  not of a house, but of an Egyptian sepulcher! The color of this bird,  of so remarkable taste in lodging, Humboldt tells us, is \"of dark  bluish-gray, mixed with streaks and specks of black. Large white spots,  which have the form of a heart, and which are bordered with black, mark  the head, the wings, and the tail. The spread of the wings, which are  composed of seventeen or eighteen quill feathers, is three feet and a  half. Suppressing, with Mr. Cuvier, the order of Picae, we must refer  this extraordinary bird to the _Sparrows_.\"    56. We can only suppose that it must be, to our popular sparrows, what  the swallow of the cinnamon country is to our subordinate swallow. Do  you recollect the cinnamon swallows of Herodotus, who build their  mud-nests in the faces of the cliffs where Dionusos was brought up, and  where nobody can get near them; and how the cinnamon merchants fetch  them joints of meat, which the unadvised birds, flying up to their  nests with, instead of cinnamon,--nest and all come down"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21189"],[0,"Aesop, in Rhyme: Old Friends in a New Dress (#7)"],[1,"a cat her kittens laid;  And at the bottom of the tree  A sow dispos'd her progeny.  Vile puss to gain her wicked ends,  Much love for both of them pretends.  First to the eagle's aerie mounts,  And thus to her false alarms recounts:  \"Madam, in truth our dangerous state,  'Tis with reluctance I relate;  But things are really gone so far,  Conceal them I no longer dare.  Night after night the treacherous sow  Our tree has undermined below;  Ere long it cannot choose but fall,  And then she hopes to eat us all.\"  Successful when she saw her lies,  Down to the bristly sow she hies;  \"My worthy neighbor!\" crying out,  \"I pray you, mind what you're about,  For to a certainty I know,  The eagle waits but till you go,  (The thing with great concern I say,)  To make your little ones her prey.\"  Suspicious dread when thus inspir'd,  Puss to her hole all day retir'd;  Stealing at night on silent paw,  To stuff her own and kittens' maw.  To stir nor sow nor eagle dare.  What more? fell hunger ends their care;  And long the mischief-making beast  With her base brood on carrion feast.    Learn hence, ye simples, ere too late,  What ills the double-tongued create.          [Illustration]    THE EAGLE, THE RAVEN AND  THE TORTOISE.      Who in their foe united find  Force, art, and a remorseless mind,  Whate'er their strength and prowess be,  To perish stand in jeopardy.    An eagle once a tortoise held,  Safe in his horny house concealed,  Which he in vain essayed to break  With all the fury of his beak.  As with his prey he wing'd the air,  A wily raven ventur'd near:  \"Your prize is excellent,\" says she,  \"And if you'll give a share to me,  I know, for all his iron hide,  How we the dainty may divide.\"  The bargain made, \"On yonder wall,  Down,\" says the raven, \"let him fall.\"  He listen'd to the hoary sinner;  And they on turtle made their dinner.    Thus fraud and force their purpose gain,  And nature fortifies in vain.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE FLY AND THE HORSE.      A fly upon a coach-box seated,  With arrogance the horses rated.  \"Advance!\" cries out the paltry thing,  \"Unless you mean to feel my sting.\"  \"Not thee we heed,\" a horse replied,  \"But him whose skilful hand can guide  The rein and whip. We better know  Than thee when we should stop or go.\"    Thus men without or sense or weight,  Think themselves born to rule the state.          [Illustration]    ESOP AT PLAY.      When an Athenian Esop saw,  Playing with school-boys once at taw,  The man with laughter shook his sides;  Esop the laughter thus derides:  \"Of this slack bow before you laid,  The meaning, sprightly sir,\" he said,  \"Explain!\" (A crowd had gather'd round.)  Surpris'd, the man no answer found:  He puzzled long, but all his wit  Could on no explanation hit.  The laugh on Esop's side; says he,  \"Why you this bow unbended see,  It is because it needs must break,  If always bent; so we must take  Due relaxation, that the mind  Its vigor may when wanted find.\"    He who in harmless sport employs  A vacant hour, is not unwise.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE OLD PILOT AND THE SAILORS.      To one complaining of his fate,  Esop this fable did relate.    A ship by raging tempests toss'd,  The seamen, giving all for lost,  'Twas who should weep and pray the most.  Grown calm at once the sky and sea,  They shout in joyful extacy.  The pilot, from experience wise,  The giddy crew did thus advise:  \"Nor much rejoice, nor over grieve,  But decently what comes receive;  Since good and ill succeed so near,  Meet ill with hope and good with fear.\"          [Illustration]    THE CRAB AND HER DAUGHTER.      Not what they hear, but what they see,  Will children and domestics be.

Learn, ninny, once for all to know,  Folks forward and not backward go.\"  \"Mamma,\" says Miss, \"how strange you talk!  Have I not learn'd from you to walk?

Says Boreas, \"his precaution's vain  'Gainst me, I'll show you for a joke  How soon I'll make him quit his cloak.\"  \"Come on,\" says Phebus, \"let us see  Who best succeeds, or you or me.\"  The wind to blow so fierce began,  He almost had upset his man;  But still his cloak, for all his roar,  Was wrapp'd more closely than before.  When Boreas what he could had done,  \"Now for my trial,\" says the Sun,  And with his beams so warm'd the air,  The man his mantle could not bear,  But open'd first, then threw aside.

From a wise emmet, well sustain'd  On what her industry had gain'd,  A grasshopper some aid desir'd.  \"What was his trade?\" the ant inquir'd.  \"I've none,\" the grasshopper replied;  \"I range the country far and wide,  Singing all day from door to door,  And have no time to form a store.\"  Shutting her granaries, says the ant,  \"No wonder, friend, you are in want;  He who all summer sings, may chance  In winter to be forc'd to dance.\"    To spend his time in idle song,  The thoughtless grasshopper was wrong;  And not to give a small supply,  The emmet mean and niggardly.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE CROW AND THE PITCHER.      Patience and ingenuity  The want of natural means supply.    A thirsty crow some water found,  But in a vessel so profound,  That with her neck at utmost stretch,  A single drop she could not reach.  Then stones she in the pitcher places,  Which to the top the water raises;  And by this innocent device  Her thirst at leisure satisfies.          [Illustration]    THE ANGLER AND THE LITTLE  FISH.      An angler a small salmon caught,  Who with much earnestness besought  That he would let her go: says she,  \"What can you do with such as me!  Next year when grown a little bigger,  I in your bag might make a figure.\"  The prudent man replied, \"No, no;  Into my pouch, though small, you go.  A bird in hand is better far,  Than two that in the bushes are.\"          [Illustration]    THE FROG AND THE FOX.      Let us our own defects amend,  Ere to guide others we pretend.    A sallow, wrinkl'd, spotted frog,  To turn physician left the bog.  \"He every malady could cure,\"  He said, \"that animals endure.\"  \"First on yourself your science show,\"  Says Reynard: \"that the world may know  Your skill and knowledge, pray begin  Of those foul spots to clear your skin:  For while you look so sick and pale,  To vend your drugs you'll ne'er prevail.\"          [Illustration]    THE APE AND HER YOUNG ONES.      An ape had cubs; one much she lov'd,  The other small affection prov'd.  Alarm'd, she hears the hunter's cries;  And catching up her darling flies:  Through fear she stumbled o'er some stones  And broke the little favorite's bones;  The other to her back who clung  Uninjured went with her along.    Mothers, beware! the fondl'd child  By too much tenderness is spoil'd;  While those who hardships have endur'd,  To suffer life are best inur'd.

A fir tree upon a humble thorn  From his high top look'd down with scorn.  \"For loftiest fanes we grow,\" she said,  \"Of us the tallest masts are made,  While thou, poor bramble, canst produce  Nothing of ornament or use.\"  \"Great tree,\" the modest thorn replied,  \"When the sharp axe shall pierce your side,  In vain you then may wish to be  Unsought-for, and unknown like me.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN.      Fools may on other fools impose;  The sage their real value knows.    An ass once found a lion's skin,  And rolling up himself therein,  From every fold that he came nigh,  Made flocks, and herds, and shepherds fly.  Ranging the country round, at last  He meets his master where he pass'd,  Who long-ears instantly descries  Through his magnificent disguise:  Laying his cudgel on his side,  \"Get home, thou stupid fool,\" he cried:  \"With others for a lion pass;  I know thee for an arrant ass.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE DOG IN THE MANGER.      A mastiff in a stable lay,  Couch'd on a manger full of hay.  When any thing drew near to eat,  He quickly forced it to retreat.
