Now, up to last night, we have had no rain  for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must  have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse's  hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than  that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab  was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the  morning--I have Gregson's word for that--it follows that it must have  been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two  individuals to the house.\"    \"That seems simple enough,\" said I; \"but how about the other man's  height?\"    \"Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from  the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though  there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow's stride  both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of  checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads  him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just  over six feet from the ground. It was child's play.\"    \"And his age?\" I asked.    \"Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest  effort, he can't be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth  of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.  Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.  There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary  life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I  advocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?\"    \"The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\" I suggested.    \"The writing on the wall was done with a man's forefinger dipped in  blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly  scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man's  nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.  It was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only made by a  Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes--in fact, I  have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can  distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar  or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective  differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.\"    \"And the florid face?\" I asked.    \"Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was  right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\"    I passed my hand over my brow. \"My head is in a whirl,\" I remarked; \"the  more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two  men--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has become of the  cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison?  Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer,  since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman's ring there? Above  all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before  decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling  all these facts.\"    My companion smiled approvingly.    \"You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\" he  said. \"There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up  my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade's discovery it was simply  a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting  Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if  you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real  German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely  say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who  overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong  channel. I'm not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You  know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick,  and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the  conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.\"    \"I shall never do that,\" I answered; \"you have brought detection as near  an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\"    My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way  in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive  to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.    \"I'll tell you one other thing,\" he said. \"Patent leathers [10] and  Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway  together as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability.  When they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather,  Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I  could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he  grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his  strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt,  into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I've told you all I know myself  now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working  basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to  Halle's concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.\"    This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way  through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the  dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.  \"That's Audley Court in there,\" he said, pointing to a narrow slit in  the line of dead-coloured brick. \"You'll find me here when you come  back.\"    Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us  into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We  picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of  discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which  was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was  engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were  shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.    He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in  his slumbers. \"I made my report at the office,\" he said.    Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it  pensively. \"We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own  lips,\" he said.    \"I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\" the constable  answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.    \"Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.\"    Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though  determined not to omit anything in his narrative.    \"I'll tell it ye from the beginning,\" he said. \"My time is from ten at  night to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the 'White  Hart'; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o'clock it  began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the Holland Grove  beat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin'.  Presently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would take  a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was  precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,  though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin' down, thinkin'  between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when  suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same  house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty  on account of him that owns them who won't have the drains seen to,  though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o' typhoid  fever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in  the window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the  door----\"    \"You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\" my companion  interrupted. \"What did you do that for?\"    Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost  amazement upon his features.    \"Why, that's true, sir,\" he said; \"though how you come to know it,  Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and  so lonesome, that I thought I'd be none the worse for some one with me.  I ain't afeared of anything on this side o' the grave; but I thought  that maybe it was him that died o' the typhoid inspecting the drains  what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o' turn, and I walked back  to the gate to see if I could see Murcher's lantern, but there wasn't no  sign of him nor of anyone else.\"    \"There was no one in the street?\"    \"Not a livin' soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself  together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,  so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin'. There was a  candle flickerin' on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light I  saw----\"    \"Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,  and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried  the kitchen door, and then----\"    John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in  his eyes. \"Where was you hid to see all that?\" he cried. \"It seems to me  that you knows a deal more than you should.\"    Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.  \"Don't get arresting me for the murder,\" he said. \"I am one of the  hounds and not the wolf; Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24407"],[0,"The Italian Cook Book (#7)"],[1," the part that remains outside, and with this cover the  compound attaching it to the lower wafer. Sprinkle again with bread  crumbs if necessary and put the piece aside repeating the operation  until all the meat is disposed of. Cook in oil or fat and serve with  lemon.    With half a pound of meat about twenty filled wafers should be obtained.      69    ROMAN FRY    II.    This can be made when you happen to have some breast of roast chicken  left over. Some chicken breast, two or three slices of tongue and ham,  one tablespoonful of grated cheese, a taste of nutmeg, are the  ingredients used. Remove the skin of the chicken and cut it as well as  the tongue and the ham, into little cubes. Make a =Balsamella= (see No.  54) in sufficient quantity and when it is cooked add the above  ingredients and let it cool well to fry using the wafer as in the  preceding.      70    RICE PANCAKE    (Frittelle di riso)    Cook thoroughly 1/4 lb. of rice in about a pint of water giving it taste  with a little piece of sugar and a taste of lemon peel. Leave it cool  and then add three yolks of eggs and a little flour. Mix well and let  the whole rest for several hours. When you are going to fry beat the  white of an egg to a froth, add it to the rice and throw into the frying  pan one tablespoonful at a time.    Serve hot sprinkled with confectionery sugar.      71    KIDNEY SAUTE    (Rognoni saltati)    Take one large kidney, or two or three small kidneys, open them and  remove all the fat. Cut lengthwise in thin slices, salt and pour as much  boiling water as is needed to cover them. When the water is thoroughly  cooled, drain it and wipe well the slices with a cloth, then put them in  a frying pan with a small piece of butter. Turn them often and when they  have cooked for five minutes put in a pinch of flour and season with  salt and pepper. Leave them on the fire until thoroughly cooked and when  you are going to take them away add another piece of butter, a sprig of  chopped parsley and a little broth if needed. The kidney must not be  kept too much on the fire, because in that case it hardens.      72    LEG OF MUTTON IN CASSEROLE    (Cosciotto di castrato in cazzaruola)    Take a shoulder or a leg of mutton and after having boned it, lard it  with small pieces of bacon dipped in salt and pepper. Salt moderately  the meat then tie it tight and put it on the fire in a pan that contains  a piece of butter and one large onion larded with clover. When it begins  to brown, take it away from the fire and add a cup of broth, or of  water, a little bunch of greens and some tomatoes cut in pieces. Put  again on a low fire and let it simmer for three hours, keeping the  saucepan closed, but opening from time to time to turn the meat. When it  is cooked, throw away the onion, rub the sauce through a sieve, remove  its fat and put it with the meat when served. The mutton must not be  overdone, for in this case it cannot be sliced.      73    STEWED CUTLETS    (Scaloppine alla Livornese)    Take some slices of tender beef, beat them well and put them in a  saucepan with a piece of butter. When this is all melted, put one or two  tablespoonfuls of broth to complete the cooking, season with salt and  pepper, add a pinch of flour and before taking them from the fire put  in a pinch of chopped parsley.      74    CUTLETS OF CHOPPED MEAT    (Scaloppine di carne battuta)    Take some good lean beef, clean it well, removing all little skins and  tendons, then first chop and after grind the meat fine in the grinder.  Season with salt, pepper and a pinch of grated cheese. Mix well and give  the meat the form of a ball then with bread crumbs over and beneath  flatten it with the rolling pin on the bread board making a sheet of  meat as thick as a silver dollar. Cut it in square pieces, as large as  the palm of the hand and cook in a saucepan with butter. When these  cutlets are browned, pour over some tomato sauce and serve.    If you prefer, use your hands instead of the rolling pin and then you  can give them the shapes you like.    If you have some left over meat this can perfectly well be mixed with  the raw meat and chopped and ground together.      75    VEAL CUTLETS STEWED    (Scaloppine alla Genovese)    Cut some lean veal meat into slices and, supposing it be a pound or a  little more, without bones, chop one fourth of a middle-sized onion and  put it in a saucepan with oil and a little piece of butter. Put over the  cutlets, one layer over the other, season with salt and butter and put  on the fire. When the meat which is below is browned put in a  teaspoonful of flour and after a while a hash of parsley with half a  clove of garlic. Then detach the cutlets the one from the other, mix  them, let them drink in the sauce, then pour hot water and a little  tomato sauce. Make it boil slowly and not much to complete the cooking  and serve with abundant sauce and with little diamonds of toast.      76    STUFFED CUTLET    (Braciuoline ripiene)    Slice from a piece of veal (about one pound) seven or eight cutlets and  beat them well with a knife blade to flatten them. Then chop some tender  veal meat and one or two slices of ham and add a small quantity of  marrow bone (of veal) and grated cheese. The marrow and the grated  cheese must be reduced to a paste with the blade of a knife. One egg is  then added to tie up the hash and a pinch of pepper, but no salt on  account of the ham and the cheese that already contain it. Spread the  cutlets and put the hash in the middle, then roll them up and tie them  with strong thread.    Now prepare a small hash with a little onion, a piece of celery a piece  of carrot and a small quantity of corned beef and put it in the fire in  a saucepan with a small piece of butter, at the same time that you put  the cutlets. Season with salt and pepper and when they begin to brown  pour some tomato sauce and complete the cooking with water. Before  serving, remove the thread with which the cutlets have been tied.      77    MEAT OMELETTE    (Polpettone)    Take one pound of veal, without bones, clean it well taking away all  skins and tendons and then chop it together with a slice of ham. Season  moderately with salt pepper and spices, add one whole egg then with  moistened hands make a ball of the chopped meat and sprinkle with flour.    Make a hash with two or three slices of onion (not more) parsley,  celery, and carrot, put it on the fire with a piece of butter and when  it is browned throw in the =Polpettone=. Brown well on all sides and  then pour in the saucepan half a tumbler of water in which half a  tablespoonful of flour has been previously diluted. Cover and make it  simmer on a very low fire, seeing that it doesn't burn. When you serve  with the gravy squeeze the juice of half a lemon over it.    If desired a hard boiled egg can be put shelled in the center of the  meat ball, so that it gives it a better appearance when sliced.      78    LAMB WITH PEAS    (Agnello ai piselli)    Take a piece of lamb from the hind side, lard it with two cloves of  garlic cut in little strips and with some sprigs of rosemary. Chop fine  a piece of lard and a slice of corned beef. Put the lamb on the fire  with this hash and a little oil and let it brown after seasoning with  salt and pepper. When it is browned add a piece of butter, some tomato  sauce, or tomato paste dissolved in water or soup stock and complete the  cooking. Take away the lamb, put the peas in the gravy, and when they  have simmered a little and are cooked put back the lamb and serve.      79    SHOULDER OF LAMB    (Spalla d'agnello)    Cut the meat of a shoulder of lamb in small pieces, or squares. Chop two  small onions, brown them with a piece of butter and when they are  browned put the meat and season with salt and pepper. Wait until the  meat begins to brown and then add another piece of butter dipped in  flour. Mix the whole and complete the cooking with soup stock or water  with bouillon cubes poured in little by little.      80    BREAST OF VEAL STEWED    (Stufatino di petto di vitella)    Break a piece of breast of veal leaving all its bones.    Make a hash with garlic, parsley, celery and carrot; add oil, pepper and  salt and put on the fire with the meat. Turn it over often, and when it  begins to brown, sprinkle over a pinch of flour and a little tomato  sauce or tomato paste diluted in water. Complete the cooking with broth  or water. Finally add a piece of butter and pieces of celery cut in big  pieces which must have been before half cooked in water and browned in  butter. Care must be taken to keep the saucepan always covered, in this  as in other stews.      81    VEAL WITH GRAVY    (Vitella in guazzetto)    First take about one pound of veal and tie it well. Then cover the  bottom of the saucepan with some thin slices of corned beef and a piece  of butter. Over this place half a lemon cut in four thin slices from  which the skin and the seeds must be removed. Over all this put the veal  which must be well browned on all sides, but care must be taken not to  burn it on account of the small quantity of liquid. Afterward, remove  the superfluous fat and pour over a cup of hot milk, that has boiled.  Cover the saucepan and complete the cooking. Before serving rub the  gravy through a sieve.      82    TRIPE WITH GRAVY    Boil some tripe in water and when it is boiled, cut it in strips, one  quarter of an inch wide and wipe it well with a cloth. Then put it in a  saucepan with butter, and when this is melted, add some brown stock or  good tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper, cook thoroughly and add  a pinch of grated cheese before taking from the saucepan.      83    VEAL LIVER IN GRAVY    (Fegato di vitella al sugo)    Chop fine a scallion or an onion, make it brown in oil and butter, and  when it has taken a dark red color, throw in the liver cut in thin  slices. When half cooked season with salt, pepper and a pinch of"]]]
