Care must be taken to force the fence up to the board  with the left hand, whilst the right hand thrusts the plane backwards and  forwards, and the plane must be kept vertical.    [Illustration: Fig. 122.--Method of using the Plough Plane.]    TONGUEING.--The grooves having been completed, the tongues have to be  made. Fig. 123 shows a sketch of a board and the method of marking out  cross tongues (A) and feather tongues (B). The usual procedure for making  cross tongues is to plane the end of the board and use a cutting gauge to  give a line the required distance from the end (see sketch). The board is  sawn with a tenon or panel saw, and the piece of timber for the tongue is  thus procured. If a feather tongue is to be used it is cut diagonally  from the board (B) and the ends cut square as shown by the dotted line.    [Illustration: Fig. 123.--Method of Marking Out for Cross Tongues and  Feather Tongues.]    Feather tongues can be obtained in fairly long lengths out of narrow  boards, whilst on the other hand cross tongues are limited by the width  of the board. After cutting off the tongues, they require planing with  nicety to fit the grooves, and the advantage of a grooved board (Fig.  105) will be appreciated. A glue spoon similar to a plumber's ladle is  generally used to pour the glue into the grooves, and it is customary to  glue the tongue into one board first; after allowing this to set, the  joint is completed in the usual manner.    TONGUEING PLANES.--Fig. 124 shows the end view of a tongueing plane for  working matched joints out of the solid. The method of holding and using  the plane is similar to the directions given for using the plough. The  part lettered F (in front) represents the fence, which in this case is  not adjustable.    [Illustration: Fig. 124., Fig. 125. End Views of Tongueing and  Grooving Planes.]    In description Fig. 125 is similar to Fig. 124. The steel skate runs in  the groove and supports the cutting blade similar to that in the plough  plane, and provided a grooving plane of this type is of suitable width it  may be used for making grooves for loose tongues. There is on the market  a metal plane which is specially designed with handles at both ends.  This plane carries a grooving iron on one side and a tongueing iron on  the other side; thus with one plane both the tongue and the groove can be  worked.    [Illustration: Fig. 126.--Tongueing Shoulders of Tenons.]    Fig. 126 shows the method of tongueing the shoulders of tenons as used in  thick timber which is to be veneered on the face. A temporary piece of  wood (A) is put between the tenon cheek and the saw, thus forming a guide  for the latter. After cutting one saw kerf a thicker piece is made and a  second saw kerf cut; the waste between the saw kerfs is now removed with  an 1/8 in. chisel and this completes the groove. A tongue of this type  acts as an extra tenon and prevents the joint from \"lipping\" (becoming  uneven) on the face side.          THE MORTISE AND TENON JOINT      A mortise and tenon joint is the method of joining timber by working a  solid rectangular projection in the one piece and cutting a corresponding  cavity to receive it in the adjoining piece. The projection is called the  tenon, and the cavity the mortise. Joints of this type are secured in  various ways. Small wedges, wooden dowels, metal dowel pins, glue and  paint are frequently used, and prior to the introduction of glue we have  examples of Egyptian furniture in which the mortise and tenon joints were  united by a composition of cheese.    [Illustration: Fig. 127.--Barefaced Tenon Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 128.--Stub Tenon.]    BAREFACED TENONS.--Fig. 127 illustrates the joint in its simplest form  and shows a tenon having only one shoulder. This is called a barefaced  tenon, and it will be noticed that the portion which carries the mortise  is thicker than the rail on which the tenon is cut. The joint is  therefore level (or flush as it is called) on one side only, and it  should never be used at the corner of a frame. It is a useful interior  joint for framing that has to be covered on the back side with  matchboarding, and allows the work to finish level at the back when the  boarding has been applied (see plan, Fig. 127).    STUB OR STUMP TENON (Fig. 128; also occasionally called a joggle  tenon).--The illustration shows a tenon as used in the interior of a  frame. The tenon is not allowed to run through the stile, and  unsightliness on the edge is thus avoided. This type of tenon is often  used at the corner of a frame, and it then requires to be haunched. A  good workshop method of gauging the depth of the mortise for a stub tenon  is shown in Fig. 129; a piece of gummed stamp paper is stuck on the side  of the mortise chisel, indicating the desired depth of the mortise. This  greatly facilitates the work, as it is not necessary to be constantly  measuring.    A HAUNCHED TENON as used at the end of a door frame is shown at Fig.  130.--In this case it will be seen that the width of the tenon is  reduced, so that sufficient timber will be left at the end of the stile  to resist the pressure of the tenon when the joint is driven together.  The short portion (A) which is left on the tenon is called the haunch,  and the cavity it engages is termed the haunching. The haunch and  haunching prevent the two pieces of timber lipping, or becoming uneven on  the face side, as would be the result if it were cut away entirely up to  the shoulder.    Fig. 131 shows the type of tenon and haunch used when the stile or  upright rail is grooved to receive a panel. In this and similar cases the  haunch is made the same width and the same depth as the groove; the  groove therefore acts as the haunching. An application of this joint is  shown in the top rail of the door frame, Fig. 132.    [Illustration: Fig. 129.--Method of Gauging for depth of Tenon.]    [Illustration: Fig. 130.--Haunched Tenon used at end of Door Frame.]    [Illustration: Fig. 131.--Haunched Tenon used when Stile is Grooved for  Panel.]    [Illustration: Fig. 132.--Application of Haunched Tenon Joint to Door  Frame.]    [Illustration: Fig. 133.--Occasional Stump Tenon.]    This type of joint is also used to connect the rail to the leg of an  ordinary kitchen table (see Fig. 167).    Fig. 133 is a variation of the stump tenon, occasionally used where the  work in hand demands a thin tenon and a stout stump to take heavy  strains.    [Illustration: Fig. 134.--Joint for Inside Framing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 135.--Haunched Barefaced Tenon.]    A joint used for inside framing is seen at Fig. 134. The rails may be  used as shown, but in the case of a door frame (as Fig. 132) they would  have the inside edges grooved to receive the panels; the tenons would  therefore be slightly narrower than shown, owing to the groove at each  edge.    A HAUNCHED BAREFACED TENON, used in similar positions to Fig. 131, is  shown at Fig. 135. The door or frame in this case would be made of  matchboarding nailed on the back as shown in the plan at Fig. 127.    WEDGES.--Fig. 136 shows the method of cutting wedges which are to be used  to wedge the tenons; this avoids waste of material. Some workers cut the  wedges from the pieces left out of the haunching of the lock rail, or  the bottom rail.    [Illustration: Fig. 136.--Cutting Wedges from Waste of Haunching.]    [Illustration: Fig. 137.--Stile and Cross Rail with Horn.]    A STILE AND CROSS RAIL, framed together, are shown at Fig. 137. The  portion above the rail is called the horn, and it is usual to leave  sufficient length of stile to project above and below the cross rails, so  that there will be no tendency for the stile to burst out at the end  whilst the cramping and wedging of the frame is in progress. On  completing the framing the horn is cut away.    In Fig. 138 we have a type of joint frequently used for garden gates. The  illustration shows the method of tenoning the three pieces to the top  rail, barefaced tenons being employed.    [Illustration: Fig. 138.--Joint used for Garden Gates.]    [Illustration: Fig. 139.--Sprocket Wheel.]    [Illustration: Fig. 140.--Boring Tool.]    SPROCKET WHEEL.--At Fig. 139 are shown the guide bar and chain of a  chain-mortising machine, two enlarged links of the chain being indicated  at A. The chain is similar in construction to the driving chain of a  bicycle, with the exception that it is provided with teeth which cut away  the timber as the chain revolves. When using a chain mortiser the  portion of the machine carrying the chain is fed downwards into the  timber, thus cutting a clean and true mortise. If, however, a stump  mortise is required it is necessary to pare away a certain amount of  timber by hand, because the machine obviously leaves a semicircular  bottom to the mortise. To overcome this difficulty the latest types of  mortising machines have a square hole-boring attachment fixed alongside  the chain. This tool, the working portion of which is illustrated in Fig.  140, consists of a square hollow chisel (E), which is sharpened from the  inside, and a revolving twist bit (D) fitted with spurs or nickers, but  without a point (one spur can be seen at the bottom of the illustration).  This bit revolves inside the shell like a chisel, and bores away the  superfluous timber, whilst the pressure exerted on the chisel causes the  corners to be cut away dead square. A mortise 3/8 in. square by 6 ins. in  depth may thus be cut. The portion marked A is the shank of the chisel  (Fig. 140), where it is fixed into the body of the machine, and the hole  at E allows the boring bit to free itself.    [Illustration: Fig. 141.--Method of Fitting an Interior Table Leg.]    [Illustration: Fig. 142.--Haunched Tenon for Skylight or Garden Frame.]    [Illustration: Fig 143.--Long and Short Shouldered Tenon.]    Fig. 141 indicates the method of fixing an interior leg to a table having"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21534"],[0,"Textiles and Clothing (#7)"],[1,"print goods are not so fast to washing and to light as those  that have been dyed in the regular way, although the better grades are  reasonably fast.    Prints are sometimes made in imitation of the more costly gingham or  other goods in which the color design is made in the weaving. It is easy  to detect the imitation as the design of printed fabrics does not  penetrate to the back of the cloth.    [Sidenote: Warp Printing]    Sometimes the warps are printed before the cloth is woven, thus giving  very pretty indefinite designs, especially in silk.      FINISHING    [Sidenote: Burling and Mending]    The finishing of woolen and worsted goods has much to do with their  appearance. No cloth comes from the loom in a perfect condition,  therefore inspection is the first process. Loose threads and knots are  carefully cut off by the \"burler\" and imperfections in the weaving  rectified by the \"menders.\" The goods may now be singed and sheared.    [Sidenote: Fulling]    [Sidenote: Flocks]    Woolens, and sometimes worsteds, are next \"fulled\" or felted by being  run round and round in a machine while moistened with soap. The friction  of the cloth on itself produces some heat which, with the moisture and  soap, causes the goods to shrink in length and width while increasing in  thickness. During this process, \"flocks\" are often added, especially for  smooth finished woolen goods. These flocks are fine fibers of wool  obtained from the shearing machine or made by cutting up old woolen  cloth. They are felted with the fibers of the goods and add weight and  firmness.    [Sidenote: Raising the Nap]    After the fulling, the goods is washed to remove the soap, dyed, if  desired, and often \"speck dyed\" with a special dye which colors the bits  of burs, remaining in the cloth, but not the wool. The next process is  the \"gigging\" which raises the nap. The cloth is run close to rapidly  revolving \"teazels\" and also may be run through a napping machine. It  may be sheared again and then steamed and pressed. This is but a brief  outline; there are generally more processes.    Woolen cloth coming from the loom may be so treated in the finishing  room as to produce fabrics entirely different in appearance. One of the  chief objects of the finishing is to give to the cloth as fine an  appearance as possible to attract the buyer. Much of the fine finish  disappears through wear, especially with inferior goods made from poor  materials. The wearing quality of the goods is primarily dependent upon  the strength and quality of the fibers of which it is made, so that the  yarn of the filling and the warp should be examined when selecting  materials. In general hard twisted yarn will give the better wearing  cloth.          FABRICS      The present day shops offer such a great variety of fabrics that only a  few of the most important can be mentioned here.      COTTON GOODS    Cotton is cool and heavy, is a non-conductor of heat, crushes easily,  but like all vegetable fibers it may be laundered without injury to the  fibers. Cotton does not take the darker dyes as well as animal fibers  and for this reason it does not combine satisfactorily with wool. As an  adulterant it wears shabby and loses its brightness. It is only when  cotton does not pretend to be anything else that it is our most useful  and durable textile. The readiness with which cotton takes the lighter  dyes and improved methods of ginning, spinning, and weaving have made  cotton goods superior to any other for summer use.    [Sidenote: Muslin]    Muslin, calico, and gingham must always head the list of cotton goods.  Muslin is coarse and fine, bleached, unbleached, and half bleached,  twilled or plain weave. Under the head of muslin brought to a high  degree of perfection in weave and finish will be found dimity, mull,  Indian lawn, organdie, Swiss, and Madras, and a host of others equally  beautiful. Madras muslin has a thin transparent ground with a heavily  raised pattern woven of a soft, thick thread unlike the ground work.  Waste is used for the pattern. Organdie muslin is soft, opaque, white,  or colored, with raised dots of pattern and plain weave. Dimity has a  fine cord running with the selvage.    Gingham is a smooth, close cotton usually woven in checks or stripes.  The yarn is dyed before being woven, making the cloth alike on both  sides, and the weave is either plain or twilled. Ginghams are also woven  of silk and cotton mixed or of silk and ramie.    Cretonne, chintz, dress linings, crape, velveteen, and lace are made of  cotton.    Flannelette, which is woven to imitate flannel, is soft and light and is  preferred by many who find woolen irritating. It does not shrink as  woolen does and is made in beautiful, soft colors and the best grades do  not fade. For nightdresses, underwear, and sheets, during cold weather  this inexpensive fabric is unequaled.    Among the heavier cotton fabrics may be mentioned denim and ticking  which are now printed in beautiful designs and colors and used for  interior decoration as well as for clothing and bedding.    The great variety of fibers, the many different ways of preparing each  for manufacture, the differences in the preparatory processes in  spinning, weaving, or in any of the later processes of finishing produce  the varied appearance of the finished product in cotton as in other  fabrics.      LINENS    Linen is one of the oldest textiles; it was used by the early Egyptians  for the priests' garments and for the wrappings of mummies. Many  housekeepers think that there is no material for sheets and pillow cases  comparable to linen, but it is not an ideal dressing for beds, for in  spite of its heavier body, it wrinkles and musses much more readily than  good cotton. For table service, however, for the toilet, and for minor  ornamental purposes linen has no equal. Its smoothness of texture, its  brilliancy which laundering increases, its wearing qualities, its  exquisite freshness, make it the one fabric fit for the table.    [Sidenote: Table Linen]    Table linen is woven plain and figured, checked and diapered. In the  figured or damask cloth the patterns stand out distinctly. This is due  to the play of light and shade on the horizontal and vertical lines. In  some lights the pattern is scarcely noticeable. When buying a cloth, let  it be between the observer and the light, for in this position the  pattern will show to the best advantage. There is a certain amount of  shade on all horizontal lines or of shadow cast by them, while the  vertical lines are illuminated, thus although the warp and woof threads  are of the same color, the pattern seems to stand out from the  background.    Linen should not be adulterated. It should be for use and not for show,  for use brightens and whitens it.    Linen adulterated with cotton becomes fuzzy through wear because of the  much shorter cotton fibers. The tendency can often be seen by rolling  the goods between the thumb and fingers.    Crash of different widths and quality furnishes tea towels, \"huck,\"  damask and other weaves come in various widths and may be purchased by  the yard. Russia crash is best for kitchen towels.      WOOLENS AND WORSTEDS    [Sidenote: Standard Goods]    The many grades of wool with the great variety of weaves and finish make  an almost infinite variety of woolen and worsted fabrics. New goods are  constantly being put upon the market, or old goods with new names.  Standard goods, such as serges, cashmere, Henrietta cloth, and covert  cloth, are always to be found in the shops. These are all twilled goods.  The serges are woven of combed wool and are harsh, tough, springy,  worsted fabrics of medium and heavy weight, with a distinct twill,  rather smooth surface, and plainer back. There are also loosely woven  serges. Cashmere and Henrietta cloth have a fine, irregular twill--the  finest made. They are woven with silk, wool, and cotton warp, but the  latter gives an inferior textile.    [Sidenote: Tweeds]    Tweeds and homespuns are names given to coarse cloth of which the wool  is spun by hand and woven on hand looms. These goods vary according to  the locality in which they are made. The wool is mixed without regard to  color, the yarn being spun and twisted in the most primitive manner,  giving the cloth an uneven, unfinished appearance. These are among the  best wearing cloths on the market and are especially suitable for suits  that will receive hard wear. Scotland and Ireland are famous for their  tweeds and homespuns and what are known as the \"cottage industries\" have  been recently revived in those countries as the products of their hand  looms have become deservedly popular abroad.    [Sidenote: Harris Tweeds]    The \"Harris Tweeds,\" made on the Island of Lewis and Harris, north of  Scotland, are in the old style by the \"crofters.\" After weaving the  goods are \"waulked\"--milled or felted--with the bare feet, accompanied  by singing the waulking song and beating time with the feet. The dyeing  is done in pots in the old-fashioned way and until recently the  dyestuffs were obtained from mosses, lichens, heather, broom, and other  plants. Now, however, some of the best aniline dyes are being used. A  peculiar characteristic of the Harris tweed is the peat smoke smell  caused by the fabric being woven in the crofters' cottages, where there  is always a strong odor of peat \"reek\" from the peat which is burned for  fuel. The ordinary so-called Harris tweeds sold in this country are made  on the southern border of Scotland, in factories, and are but imitations  of the real Harris tweeds.    The light colored tweeds--natural color of wool--come from the island of  St. Kilda. This island stands out in mid ocean, barren and wild, devoid  of plants or shrubs of any kind for making dyes. The crofters content  themselves without dyestuffs. The industry is maintained by nobility to  help the islanders and the fabrics are fashionable"]]]
