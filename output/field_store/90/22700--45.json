In some such  way does the great Law teach us. Our sorrows and losses teach us the  pain of the sorrow and loss we inflict on others, and so we cease to  inflict them.    Now as to the more direct application. To conquer a sin, let heart and  mind rest, not on the sin, but on the contrary virtue. Let the sin be  forced out by positive growth in the true direction, not by direct  opposition. Turn away from the sin and go forward courageously,  constructively, creatively, in well-doing. In this way the whole nature  will gradually be drawn up to the higher level, on which the sin does  not even exist. The conquest of a sin is a matter of growth and  evolution, rather than of opposition.    34. Transgressions are injury, falsehood, theft, incontinence, envy;  whether committed, or caused, or assented to, through greed, wrath,  or infatuation; whether faint, or middling, or excessive; bearing  endless, fruit of ignorance and pain. Therefore must the weight be cast  on the other side.    Here are the causes of sin: greed, wrath, infatuation, with their effects,  ignorance and pain. The causes are to be cured by better wisdom, by  a truer understanding of the Self, of Life. For greed cannot endure  before the realization that the whole world belongs to the Self, which  Self we are; nor can we hold wrath against one who is one with the  Self, and therefore with ourselves; nor can infatuation, which is the  seeking for the happiness of the All in some limited part of it, survive  the knowledge that we are heirs of the All. Therefore let thought and  imagination, mind and heart, throw their weight on the other side; the  side, not of the world, but of the Self.    35. Where non-injury is perfected, all enmity ceases in the presence of  him who possesses it.    We come now to the spiritual powers which result from keeping the  Commandments; from the obedience to spiritual law which is the  keeping of the Commandments. Where the heart is full of kindness  which seeks no injury to another, either in act or thought or wish, this  full love creates an atmosphere of harmony, whose benign power  touches with healing all who come within its influence. Peace in the  heart radiates peace to other hearts, even more surely than contention  breeds contention.    36. When he is perfected in truth, all acts and their fruits depend on  him.    The commentator thus explains: If he who has attained should say to  a man, Become righteous! the man becomes righteous. If he should  say, Gain heaven! the man gains heaven. His word is not in vain.    Exactly the same doctrine was taught by the Master who said to his  disciples: Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose soever sins ye remit they  are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are  retained.    37. Where cessation from theft is perfected, all treasures present  themselves to him who possesses it.    Here is a sentence which may warn us that, beside the outer and  apparent meaning, there is in many of these sentences a second and  finer significance. The obvious meaning is, that he who has wholly  ceased from theft, in act, thought and wish, finds buried treasures in  his path, treasures of jewels and gold and pearls. The deeper truth is,  that he who in every least thing is wholly honest with the spirit of Life,  finds Life supporting him in all things, and gains admittance to the  treasure house of Life, the spiritual universe.    38. For him who is perfect in continence, the reward is valour and  virility.    The creative power, strong and full of vigour, is no longer dissipated,  but turned to spiritual uses. It upholds and endows the spiritual man,  conferring on him the creative will, the power to engender spiritual  children instead of bodily progeny. An epoch of life, that of man the  animal, has come to an end; a new epoch, that of the spiritual man, is  opened. The old creative power is superseded and transcended; a new  creative power, that of the spiritual man, takes its place, carrying with  it the power to work creatively in others for righteousness and eternal  life.    One of the commentaries says that he who has attained is able to  transfer to the minds of his disciples what he knows concerning divine  union, and the means of gaining it. This is one of the powers of purity.    39. Where there is firm conquest of covetousness, he who has  conquered it awakes to the how and why of life.    So it is said that, before we can understand the laws of Karma, we  must free ourselves from Karma. The conquest of covetousness brings  this rich fruit, because the root of covetousness is the desire of the  individual soul, the will toward manifested life. And where the desire  of the individual soul is overcome by the superb, still life of the  universal Soul welling up in the heart within, the great secret is  discerned, the secret that the individual soul is not an isolated reality,  but the ray, the manifest instrument of the Life, which turns it this way  and that until the great work is accomplished, the age-long lesson  learned. Thus is the how and why of life disclosed by ceasing from  covetousness. The Commentator says that this includes a knowledge  of one's former births.    40. Through purity a withdrawal from one's own bodily life, a ceasing  from infatuation with the bodily life of others.    As the spiritual light grows in the heart within, as the taste for pure  Life grows stronger, the consciousness opens toward the great, secret  places within, where all life is one, where all lives are one. Thereafter,  this outer, manifested, fugitive life, whether of ourselves or of others,  loses something of its charm and glamour, and we seek rather the  deep infinitudes. Instead of the outer form and surroundings of our  lives, we long for their inner and everlasting essence. We desire not so  much outer converse and closeness to our friends, but rather that quiet  communion with them in the inner chamber of the soul, where spirit  speaks to spirit, and spirit answers; where alienation and separation  never enter; where sickness and sorrow and death cannot come.    41. To the pure of heart come also a quiet spirit, one-pointed thought,  the victory over sensuality, and fitness to behold the Soul.    Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God, who is the  supreme Soul; the ultimate Self of all beings. In the deepest sense,  purity means fitness for this vision, and also a heart cleansed from all  disquiet, from all wandering and unbridled thought, from the torment  of sensuous imaginings; and when the spirit is thus cleansed and pure,  it becomes at one in essence with its source, the great Spirit, the  primal Life. One consciousness now thrills through both, for the  psychic partition wall is broken down. Then shall the pure in heart see  God, because they become God.    42. From acceptance, the disciple gains happiness supreme.    One of the wise has said: accept conditions, accept others, accept  yourself. This is the true acceptance, for all these things are what they  are through the will of the higher Self, except their deficiencies, which  come through thwarting the will of the higher Self, and can be  conquered only through compliance with that will. By the true  acceptance, the disciple comes into oneness of spirit with the  overruling Soul; and, since the own nature of the Soul is being,  happiness, bliss, he comes thereby into happiness supreme.    43. The perfection of the powers of the bodily vesture comes through  the wearing away of impurities, and through fervent aspiration.    This is true of the physical powers, and of those which dwell in the  higher vestures. There must be, first, purity; as the blood must be  pure, before one can attain to physical health. But absence of impurity  is not in itself enough, else would many nerveless ascetics of the  cloisters rank as high saints. There is needed, further, a positive fire of  the will; a keen vital vigour for the physical powers, and something  finer, purer, stronger, but of kindred essence, for the higher powers.  The fire of genius is something more than a phrase, for there can be  no genius without the celestial fire of the awakened spiritual will.    44. Through spiritual reading, the disciple gains communion with the  divine Power on which his heart is set.    Spiritual reading meant, for ancient India, something more than it does  with us. It meant, first, the recital of sacred texts, which, in their very  sounds, had mystical potencies; and it meant a recital of texts which  were divinely emanated, and held in themselves the living, potent  essence of the divine.    For us, spiritual reading means a communing with the recorded  teachings of the Masters of wisdom, whereby we read ourselves into  the Master's mind, just as through his music one can enter into the  mind and soul of the master musician. It has been well said that all  true art is contagion of feeling; so that through the true reading of true  books we do indeed read ourselves into the spirit of the Masters, share  in the atmosphere of their wisdom and power, and come at last into  their very presence.    45. Soul-vision is perfected through perfect obedience to the Master.    The sorrow and darkness of life come of the erring personal will  which sets itself against the will of the Soul, the one great Life. The  error of the personal will is inevitable, since each will must be free to  choose, to try and fail, and so to find the path. And sorrow and  darkness are inevitable, until the path be found, and the personal will  made once more one with the greater Will, wherein it finds rest and  power, without losing freedom. In His will is our peace. And with that  peace comes light. Soul-vision is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25266"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Paul (#7)"],[1," as  Legate. Ridley, Rogers, and Bradford were amongst those who suffered  at the stake, while May escaped.    Of course the old services were reintroduced; and we turn from grave to  gay in a record of one of these revived functions. A doe was offered on  the Conversion and a buck on the Commemoration of St. Paul, both in  connection with some quaint old-world land tenure. Our records tell us  that Bonner wore his mitre, and the Chapter their copes, with garlands  of roses on their heads. The buck--it was the Commemoration--was  brought to the high altar, and at some time and place not exactly  defined but within the choir, was slain; and the head, severed and  raised on a pole, was borne before the processional cross to the west  door. Here a horn was blown, and other horns in different parts of the  City answered.[27]    =Elizabeth.=--After the death of Mary, as the diocese of London had  been the chief sufferer from the persecutions, and as the excitement  in the City ran very high, the sermons at the Cross were for a time  wisely discontinued. The Primate Pole, the last Romanist at Canterbury  and the last Legate openly accredited to an English sovereign, and  many of his suffragans likewise, died about the same time; and it was  left for Bonner to preside over a thin Upper House.    What was to be done with the bishop? To allow him to continue in his  high office was tantamount to a grave scandal to religion, and his  person was not safe from the fury of the populace. He was replaced by  Edmund Grindal, and spent the remaining ten years of his life chiefly  in the security of the Marshalsea, without any undue vigour or  harshness. Mary's first dean, Feckenham, had been made abbot of the  resuscitated regular foundation of Westminster, and his successor was  quietly ejected in favour of the restored May, whilst a few of the  other dignitaries lost their stalls. The Epistle and Gospel were first  read in English, and eventually the Prayer Book was resumed; but the  changes were made gradually; and, considering the provocation, no  vindictive spirit was displayed.    In June, 1561, the beautiful spire was destroyed by fire caused by  lightning or by a plumber's neglect, and the Chapter House seriously  injured. We have no trustworthy plates prior to this fire, and the  various estimates about the height of the spire and other matters are  anything but infallible. Service was held at St. Gregory's, and the  roof and other parts restored at a cost of L6,700, but the  architecture was never the same afterwards. Of course the disappointed  Romanists attributed the disaster to the Divine anger, and Bishop  Pilkington, of Durham, preaching next Sunday at the Cross, to the  still continued desecration.    It is difficult for us to understand why this desecration was allowed  to go on. A pillory was indeed set up outside near the bishop's  palace, and a man convicted of fighting nailed there by his ears,  which were afterwards cut off; but this must have been an offence  exceptionally outrageous. \"What swearing is there,\" says Dekker, \"what  shouldering, what jostling, what jeering, what biting of thumbs to  beget quarrels.\" At Bishop Bancroft's Visitation a verger complained  that colliers with coal-sacks, butchers' men with meat, and others  made the interior a short cut. Bishop Corbet, of Norwich, wrote:        \"When I past Paules, and travelled in that Walke        Where all our Brittaine-sinners sweare and talke,      Ould Harry-ruffians, bankrupts, suthe-sayers,        And youth, whose cousenage is as ould as theirs.\"    The choir boys even during service time were on the alert for \"spur  money,\" a fine due for the wearing of spurs. \"Paul's Walk\" (the  central aisle of the nave), said Bishop Earle, of Salisbury, \"is the  land's epitome.... It is the general mart of all famous lies.\"  Shakespeare was thinking of his own time, as well as of the time of  Henry IV. (2 Henry IV., act 1, scene 2) when he makes Falstaff engage  Bardolph, out of place and standing at the servant-men's pillow to be  hired. John Evelyn called the cathedral a den of thieves. Before, we  have mentioned that this abuse existed in mediaeval times; the above  authorities show that it still went on right up to the Fire. Doctrine  might be purified, and rites reformed; Paul's Walk was neither  purified nor reformed.    John Felton nailed the Bull of Pius V. excommunicating and deposing  Elizabeth (_Regnans in Excelsis_) to the bishop's gate at night (May  15, 1570), and was hung on a gallows hard by. We pass on from this,  and from Elizabeth's \"tuning of the pulpit\" and various other matters,  to the Armada. By September some of the captured flags were displayed  on high outside, and waved over the preacher at the Cross. The last  Sunday in November was appointed for the State Thanksgiving, Aylmer  being bishop and Nowell dean. The Queen was driven in a chariot drawn  by four white horses. Bishop John Piers, of Salisbury, the Almoner,  was the preacher. His sermon has not come down, but the Form of Prayer  has--\"Turning the destruction they intended against us upon their own  head.\" At the conclusion, the Queen remained in the City to dine with  the bishop.    After the death of the great Queen, the leading conspirators in the  Gunpowder Plot[28] were executed outside the West Front. John King,  Dean of Christ Church, styled by James \"the _king_ of preachers,\" was  consecrated bishop in 1611; and the next year Bartholomew Leggatt was  condemned as a heretic in the Consistory Court, and burnt at  Smithfield; and a month later Edward Wightman suffered a like fate at  Lichfield. But the Marian persecutions had made all good citizens sick  of such sights, and henceforth, says Fuller, the king yielding to  public opinion, \"politically preferred that heretics, though  condemned, should silently and privately waste themselves away in  prison.\"    =Inigo Jones.=--A certain Master John Farley agitated in favour of the  decaying and neglected fabric, and King James attended service in  state to hear his favourite preacher, the bishop, plead for  restoration from an appropriate text chosen by the king himself (March  26, 1620). After the service came a banquet at the bishop's palace,  and after the banquet a meeting; and a Royal Commission was appointed  before the end of the year on which the Lord Mayor was the first  person named. Amongst other commissioners was Inigo Jones, Surveyor of  the Royal Works. He had studied in Italy and was an enthusiastic  student of the Italian Renaissance. Unfortunately the public was  anything but enthusiastic, and only a small sum was contributed, which  went in the purchase of stone. Matters came to a complete standstill;  and shortly prior to his assassination the elder Villiers is reported  to have stolen part of the stone for a watergate for his new town  house.       [Illustration: INIGO JONES' PORTICO.     _After Hollar._]    The Commission died with the king, and Laud, becoming bishop,  persuaded Charles to issue a new one. This time a handsome sum was  collected, and work was commenced. As regards the exterior, the nave  and west sides of the two transepts were cased throughout, and some  repairs made to the east end.[29] The chief alteration in the interior  was the adornment and restoration of the choir screen, at the expense  of Sir Paul Pindar, and with the laudable object of putting an end to  desecration. Inigo Jones added a noble classical portico to the West  End as a successor to Paul's Walk. We forgive the lack of harmony with  the Norman nave, when we recall the truly religious motive.    But evil days for the cathedral were approaching. In the House of  Commons (February 11, 1629), Oliver Cromwell, Member for Huntingdon  town, made his maiden speech in a Grand Committee on Religion. He  complained that Dr. Alablaster had preached flat Popery at Paul's  Cross, and that the Doctor's bishop, Neile of Winchester, would not  have it otherwise.[30] Alablaster was High Church, and the Third  Parliament of Charles was not.    =The Civil War.=--The outbreak of the Civil War put an end to the  Commission, and the moneys were confiscated.[31] The Long Parliament  acquired the supremacy in the City, and from 1643 Inigo Jones ceased  to act as surveyor, dying before the Restoration. The whole staff was  expelled, and their revenues sequestrated; and Dr. Cornelius Burgess  was appointed preacher, some of the more eastern bays of the choir  being walled in by a brick partition as his chapel or conventicle. The  chief fault to be found with Burgess is that he was out of place in a  cathedral, otherwise there is much to be said in his favour. Even in  those times, when religious fanaticism went mad, he behaved with  discretion, and courageously headed the petition of London ministers  against the execution of the king. Hugh Peters figures in the crypt,  and other parts were assigned as meeting-houses. It is better to pass  over as quickly as may be the behaviour of the soldiery and populace.  \"Paul's Cathedral,\" says Carlyle, \"is now a Horseguard; horses stamp  in the Canons' stalls there [but the choir was mainly reserved for  Burgess and his sermons], and Paul's Cross itself, as smacking of  Popery ... was swept altogether away, and its leaden roof melted into  bullets, or mixed with tin for culinary pewter.\"[32] Its very name,  the Cross, was against it; and thus fell, never to be restored, the  most famous pulpit in England, which through successive generations  had been part and parcel of English history. Carlyle also tell us that  Trooper Lockyer, of Whalley's Horse, \"of excellent parts and much  beloved,\" was shot in the churchyard for mutiny, \"amid the tears of  men and women.\"[33]    Monuments which had escaped earlier vandals were now defaced and  destroyed; the scaffolding was seized; part of the roof on the south  side fell in, and the lead was used for water-pipes. The new portico  was hacked about"]]]
