In Grenada, my  expectations, sanguine as they were, have been more than realized. It is  the nearest approach to paradise that I have yet seen: a spot that  cannot disappoint any one, as the best part of its beauty, like that of  a beautiful woman, is of a nature, that not even genius itself can  describe. I visit the \"Alhambra\" daily, and write a letter within its  sacred precincts. Externally the \"Alhambra\" has a severe and forbidding  appearance, like that of an ancient fortress, but within, it exceeds in  beauty all one's preconceptions, however warm and extravagant they may  be. The terrace which conducts to it, after having passed through the  huge gate which opens into its jurisdiction, is embowered with tall,  straight, and overhanging elms, nicely trimmed and of the richest  foliage, while here and there a fountain marks the bends in the road.  Along this enchanting walk marble seats are arranged, where one can  repose for a moment to listen to the notes of the nightingales in the  adjacent groves, and charm his fancy with the melodious rippling of  water at his feet. If one has any feeling in his soul, in such a spot as  this he is sure to find it. If he has a woman with him he is certain to  fall in love, and if he has not, he may perhaps fall--_asleep_!    Besides the \"Alhambra,\" there are numerous objects of peculiar interest  to be seen in Grenada. The Cathedral, though inferior to those of  Seville and Toledo in magnificence and grandeur, is nevertheless a  splendid edifice, and is rendered particularly interesting as being the  last resting-place of Ferdinand and Isabella, the wisest sovereigns who  ever ruled over Spain. Yesterday we visited the royal chapel, and beheld  the beautiful monument erected to their memory. In its architecture it  struck me as being exceedingly unique, the work of consummate skill and  exquisite taste. It is of delicate alabaster, and was wrought, it is  said, at Genoa, by Peralla. It is about twelve feet in length by some  ten in breadth, profusely covered with figures and ingenious designs in  relief, while upon it, as upon a bridal couch, the statues of Ferdinand  and Isabella, in their royal robes, are extended side by side--their  faces like those of life, in calm and beautiful repose, elevated toward  heaven. Having examined the monument for some time, we descended into  the little arched vault beneath, which contained the coffins of the  deceased monarchs. These were of lead, strongly bound with iron, and the  letter F., upon that of Ferdinand, was the only sign which distinguished  them from each other. While in that small chamber of the dead, my memory  ran back to the great events of the fifteenth century--the discovery of  America and the conquest of Grenada--which owed their origin to the  enterprise of the two famous personages whose ashes were inclosed in the  heavy leaden cases at my feet; and I never felt more profoundly the  insignificance of earthly renown, or the vanity of individual glory.  \"The paths of glory lead but to the grave.\" Coming from the tomb, we  were next shown a sceptre and crown which had been used by the  illustrious dead. Also a sword which Ferdinand himself wore in his  battles with the Moors. Leaving the Cathedral, we proceeded along to the  Moorish palace called \"The Generaliffe.\" This edifice is not far from  the \"Alhambra,\" and is separated from it by a deep and romantic ravine.  Passing through a level avenue of cypress and rosebushes, we arrived at  its main entrance. The first view of the interior was ravishing. The  virgin stream of the Daru, here collected in a narrow canal, was rushing  with a musical sound through arbors of cypresses and files of flowery  trees, arranged like fairy sentinels on either side. Passing on, we soon  reached the \"trysting-place\" of Zoraya, the frail Sultana. This spot  certainly is too exquisitely beautiful for me to describe. It is of a  rectangular form, and bordered with beds of flowers and handsome trees.  On one side is an arbor of gigantic cypresses, beautifully trained, the  trunks of which were tastefully enamelled with delicate vines, laden  with blooming roses. Within the square is an artificial pond of water,  sparkling with golden fishes, in the centre of which is a fairy-like  island, teeming with flowers of numerous kinds. The general effect of  the view was like that of enchantment, or like one of those  indescribable scenes that sometimes visit us in dreams, the beauty of  which surpasses reality. But my time will not allow me to indulge very  largely in detail. From the \"Generaliffe\" we proceeded to several of the  churches, and afterward to an extensive mad-house. We were not a little  amused. One old gentleman, _about_ the \"_maddest of the lot_,\" who had  formerly been a general in the Spanish army, told me he liked his  present quarters very well, but that his companions were nothing better  than a pack of fools! The grounds about this humane establishment are  prettily laid out in gardens and handsome walks, and the patients  themselves have a spacious and pleasant yard for their exercise and  recreation. All this reflects favorably upon the character of the  Spanish people, who are ever kind to such as are afflicted or in  distress. They never scoff at human suffering in any form, however fond  they may be of the savage ferocity of the bull-fight. They are  compassionate to the poor, and even when the request of a beggar is  denied, it is done in such gentle terms, that the denial is robbed of  its sting. \"Pardon me for God's sake, brother,\" is the usual form. I  have found much to admire among the Spaniards. No nation, not even the  French, exceeds them in true politeness or good breeding. When I left  Madrid, a friend of mine procured for me an introductory letter, from a  lady whom to this day I have never seen, addressed to her children  living at Grenada. To my great surprise, the ladies called in their  carriage yesterday and inquired for me, although I had not then  presented my letter of introduction. To-day I called upon the family, in  company with Mr. Wetmore, (a young American from New York, who has just  reached Grenada from Madrid,) and was most hospitably and kindly  received. One of the young ladies has perhaps the sweetest face I ever  saw, and to her beauty her graceful manners add an indescribable charm.  I am quite certain that it would be impossible for me or any other man  to see her many times with impunity. The influence of such attractions  with me, I confess, is quite irresistible. Beauty is more potent than  any other agent of human power, and he who is able to resist it must be  a heartless Samson indeed.                                              Truly yours, JOHN E. WARREN.           *       *       *       *       *    BLACKWOOD ON DANCERS IN SMALLCLOTHES.    --For a man to be fond of shuffling and twirling himself out of the  dignity of step which nature gave him--picking his way through a  quadrille like a goose upon red hot bricks, or gyrating like a bad  teetotum in what English fashionables are pleased to term a \"valse\"--I  never see a man thus occupied without a fervent desire to kick him.           *       *       *       *       *    Sincerity is like traveling on a plain beaten road, which commonly  brings a man sooner to his journey's end than by-ways, in which men  often lose themselves.          \"MARKS OF BARHAMVILLE.\"      We were summoned one evening some three or four months ago to the house  of an eminent New Yorker to hear read the manuscript verses of a  gentleman from South Carolina, who was quite sure that he had earned for  himself a name that should endure forever as a part of the national  glory. We had good wine and the choicest company, and these kept us from  sleep through numerous scenas and cantos, and if we formed any judgment  in the premises we believe we did not express one. In due time Messrs.  Appleton published the book, and as it has not been noticed much here,  we copy from the June _Fraser_ the following paragraphs about it,  premising that our author had no faith in American criticism, but was  quite willing to abide the decisions of English reviewers:    \"The general fault of carelessness and clumsiness runs through the  volume of poems, apparently, of a Trans-atlantic author, 'Marks of  Barhamville.' The book is just three times as large as it should have  been--as is usually the case nowadays. When will poets learn that  'brevity is the soul of wit:' and more, that saying a thing in three  weak lines is no substitute whatsoever for the power of saying it in one  strong one? Of the first poem in the book, 'Elfreide of Guldal,' we are  unable to speak, having been unable to read it; but it evinces at least  more historic information than is common just now among our poets, who  seem to forget utterly that _ex nihilo nihil fit_, and that the brains  of man may be as surely pumped dry as any other vessel, if nothing be  put in to replace what is taken out. Mr. Marks cannot avoid, too, giving  us, like every one else, a set of clinical lectures on the morbid  anatomy of his own inner man, under the appropriate title of '_Weeds_  from Life's Sea-shore;' forgetting that sea-weeds must be very rare and  delicate indeed to be worth preserving in a _hortus siccus_, instead of  being usefully covered out of sight in the nearest earth-heap, there to  turn into manure. He is, however, more objective than most of his  self-exenterating compeers; but he wants the grace and cheerful  lightness of the American school. A large part of his volume is taken up  with 'Maia, a masque'--an imitation of Milton's manner, but not, alas!  of his melody and polish; as, for instance:--      \"'Not a warbler wakes his lay,    Not a dewdrop pearls the spray,    Not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21530"],[0,"The Angel of Terror (#7)"],[1,"heating apparatus is splendid and----\"    \"Meredith was married.\"    If she had thrown a bomb at him she could not have produced a more  tremendous sensation. He gaped at her, and pushed himself back from the  table.    \"Married?\" His voice was a squeak.    She nodded.    \"It's a lie,\" he roared. All his suavity dropped away from him, his face  was distorted and puckered with anger and grew a shade darker. \"Married,  you lying little beast! He couldn't have been married! It was only a few  minutes after eight, and the parson didn't come till nine. I'll break  your neck if you try to scare me! I've told you about that before....\"    He raved on, and she listened unmoved.    \"He was married at eight o'clock by a man they brought down from  Oxford, and who stayed the night in the house,\" she repeated with great  calmness. \"There's no sense in lashing yourself into a rage. I've seen  the bride, and spoken to the clergyman.\"    From the bullying, raging madman, he became a whimpering, pitiable  thing. His chin trembled, the big hands he laid on the tablecloth shook  with a fever.    \"What are we going to do?\" he wailed. \"My God, Jean, what are we going  to do?\"    She rose and went to the sideboard, poured out a stiff dose of brandy  from a decanter and brought it across to him without a word. She was  used to these tantrums, and to their inevitable ending. She was neither  hurt, surprised, nor disgusted. This pale, ethereal being was the  dominant partner of the combination. Nerves she did not possess, fears  she did not know. She had acquired the precise sense of a great surgeon  in whom pity was a detached emotion, and one which never intruded itself  into the operating chamber. She was no more phenomenal than they, save  that she did not feel bound by the conventions and laws which govern  them as members of an ordered society. It requires no greater nerve to  slay than to cure. She had had that matter out with herself, and had  settled it to her own satisfaction.    \"You will have to put off your trip to Monte Carlo,\" she said, as he  drank the brandy greedily.    \"We've lost everything now,\" he stuttered, \"everything.\"    \"This girl has no relations,\" said the daughter steadily. \"Her  heirs-at-law are ourselves.\"    He put down the glass, and looked at her, and became almost immediately  his old self.    \"My dear,\" he said admiringly, \"you are really wonderful. Of course, it  was childish of me. Now what do you suggest?\"    \"Unlock that door,\" she said in a low voice, \"I want to call the maid.\"    As he walked to the door, she pressed the footbell, and soon after the  faded woman who attended her came into the room.    \"Hart,\" she said, \"I want you to find my emerald ring, the small one,  the little pearl necklet, and the diamond scarf pin. Pack them carefully  in a box with cotton wool.\"    \"Yes, madam,\" said the woman, and went out.    \"Now what are you going to do, Jean?\" asked her father.    \"I am returning them to Mrs. Meredith,\" said the girl coolly. \"They were  presents given to me by her husband, and I feel after this tragic ending  of my dream that I can no longer bear the sight of them.\"    \"He didn't give you those things, he gave you the chain. Besides, you  are throwing away good money?\"    \"I know he never gave them to me, and I am not throwing away good  money,\" she said patiently. \"Mrs. Meredith will return them, and she  will give me an opportunity of throwing a little light upon James  Meredith, an opportunity which I very much desire.\"    Later she went up to her pretty little sitting-room on the first floor,  and wrote a letter.         \"_Dear Mrs. Meredith.--I am sending you the few trinkets which       James gave to me in happier days. They are all that I have of       his, and you, as a woman, will realise that whilst the       possession of them brings me many unhappy memories, yet they       have been a certain comfort to me. I wish I could dispose of       memory as easily as I send these to you (for I feel they are       really your property) but more do I wish that I could recall       and obliterate the occasion which has made Mr. Glover so bitter       an enemy of mine._         \"_Thinking over the past, I see that I was at fault, but I know       that you will sympathise with me when the truth is revealed to       you. A young girl, unused to the ways of men, perhaps I       attached too much importance to Mr. Glover's attentions, and       resented them too crudely. In those days I thought it was       unpardonable that a man who professed to be poor James's best       friend, should make love to his fiancee, though I suppose that       such things happen, and are endured by the modern girl. A man       does not readily forgive a woman for making him feel a fool--it       is the one unpardonable offence that a girl can commit.       Therefore, I do not resent his enmity as much as you might       think. Believe me, I feel for you very much in these trying       days. Let me say again that I hope your future will be       bright._\"    She blotted the letter, put it in an envelope, and addressed it, and  taking down a book from one of the well-stocked shelves, drew her chair  to the fire, and began reading.    Mr. Briggerland came in an hour after, looked over her shoulder at the  title, and made a sound of disapproval.    \"I can't understand your liking for that kind of book,\" he said.    The book was one of the two volumes of \"Chronicles of Crime,\" and she  looked up with a smile.    \"Can't you? It's very easily explained. It is the most encouraging work  in my collection. Sit down for a minute.\"    \"A record of vulgar criminals,\" he growled. \"Their infernal last dying  speeches, their processions to Tyburn--phaugh!\"    She smiled again, and looked down at the book. The wide margins were  covered with pencilled notes in her writing.    \"They're a splendid mental exercise,\" she said. \"In every case I have  written down how the criminal might have escaped arrest, but they were  all so vulgar, and so stupid. Really the police of the time deserve no  credit for catching them. It is the same with modern criminals....\"    She went to the shelf, and took down two large scrap-books, carried them  across to the fire, and opened one on her knees.    \"Vulgar and stupid, every one of them,\" she repeated, as she turned the  leaves rapidly.    \"The clever ones get caught at times,\" said Briggerland gloomily.    \"Never,\" she said, and closed the book with a snap. \"In England, in  France, in America, and in almost every civilised country, there are  murderers walking about to-day, respected by their fellow citizens.  Murderers, of whose crimes the police are ignorant. Look at these.\" She  opened the book again. \"Here is the case of Rell, who poisons a  troublesome creditor with weed-killer. Everybody in the town knew he  bought the weed-killer; everybody knew that he was in debt to this man.  What chance had he of escaping? Here's Jewelville--he kills his wife,  buries her in the cellar, and then calls attention to himself by running  away. Here's Morden, who kills his sister-in-law for the sake of her  insurance money, and who also buys the poison in broad daylight, and is  found with a bottle in his pocket. Such people deserve hanging.\"    \"I wish to heaven you wouldn't talk about hanging,\" said Briggerland  tremulously, \"you're inhuman, Jean, by God--\"    \"I'm an angel,\" she smiled, \"and I have press cuttings to prove it! The  _Daily Recorder_ had half a column on my appearance in the box at Jim's  trial.\"    He looked over toward the writing-table, saw the letter, and picked it  up.    \"So you've written to the lady. Are you sending her the jewels?\"    She nodded.    He looked at her quickly.    \"You haven't been up to any funny business with them, have you?\" he  asked suspiciously, and she smiled.    \"My dear parent,\" drawled Jean Briggerland, \"after my lecture on the  stupidity of the average criminal, do you imagine I should do anything  so _gauche_?\"          Chapter VIII      \"And now, Mrs. Meredith,\" said Jack Glover, \"what are you going to do?\"    He had spent the greater part of the morning with the new heiress, and  Lydia had listened, speechless, as he recited a long and meaningless  list of securities, of estates, of ground rents, balances and the like,  which she had inherited.    \"What am I going to do?\" she said, shaking her head, hopelessly. \"I  don't know. I haven't the slightest idea, Mr. Glover. It is so  bewildering. Do I understand that all this property is mine?\"    \"Not yet,\" said Jack with a smile, \"but it is so much yours that on the  strength of the will we are willing to advance you money to almost any  extent. The will has to be proved, and probate must be taken, but when  these legal formalities are settled, and we have paid the very heavy  death duties, you will be entitled to dispose of your fortune as you  wish. As a matter of fact,\" he added, \"you could do that now. At any  rate, you cannot live here in Brinksome Street, and I have taken the  liberty of hiring a furnished flat on your behalf. One of our clients  has gone away to the Continent and left the flat for me to dispose of.  The rent is very low, about twenty guineas a week.\"    \"Twenty guineas a week!\" gasped the horrified girl, \"why, I can't----\"    And then she realised that she \"could.\"    Twenty guineas a week was as nothing to her. This fact more than  anything else, brought her to an understanding of her fortune.    \"I suppose I had better move,\" she said dubiously. \"Mrs. Morgan is  giving up this house, and she asked me whether I had any plans. I think  she'd be willing to come as my housekeeper.\"    \"Excellent,\" nodded Jack. \"You'll want a maid as well and, of course,  you will have to put up Jaggs for the nights.\"    \"Jaggs?\" she said in astonishment.    \"Jaggs,\" repeated Jack solemnly. \"You see, Miss--I beg your pardon, Mrs.  Meredith, I'm rather concerned about you, and I want "]]]
