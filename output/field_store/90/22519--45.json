Look out and don't let her shlip out of our  hands.    _Courtier._ [_Aside._] Poor fool, he has said the very thing he should  have concealed. So Vasantasena is in love with Charudatta? The  proverb is right. Pearl suits with pearl. Well, I have had enough  of this fool. [_Aloud._] Did you say the good merchant's house was  to the left, you jackass?    _Sansthanaka._ Yes. His house is to the left.    _Vasantasena._ [_Aside._] Oh, wonderful! If his house is really at my  left hand, then the scoundrel has helped me in the very act of hurting  me, for he has guided me to my love.    _Sansthanaka._ But mashter, it's pitch dark and it's like hunting  for a grain of soot in a pile of shpotted beans. Now you shee Vasantasena  and now you don't.    _Courtier._ Pitch dark it is indeed.        The sudden darkness seems to steal      The keenness of my sight;      My open eyes, as with a seal,      Are closed by blackest night.                                33    And again:        Darkness anoints my body, and the sky      Drops ointment of thick darkness, till mine eye      Is all unprofitable grown to me,      Like service done to them who cheat and lie.                 34    _Sansthanaka._ Mashter, I'm looking for Vasantasena.    _Courtier._ Is there anything you can trace her by, jackass?    _Sansthanaka._ Like what, for inshtance?    P. 28.3]    _Courtier._ Like the tinkling of her jewels, for instance, or the fragrance  of her garlands.    _Sansthanaka._ I hear the shmell of her garlands, but my nose is  shtuffed so full of darkness that I don't shee the shound of her  jewels very clearly.    _Courtier._ [_To Vasantasena. Aside._] Vasantasena,        'T is true, the night is dark, O timid maid,      And like the lightning hidden in the cloud,      You are not seen; yet you will be betrayed      By fragrant garlands and by anklets loud.                    35    Have you heard me, Vasantasena?    _Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] Heard and understood. [_She removes  the ankle-rings, lays aside the garlands, and takes a few steps, feeling  her way._] I can feel the wall of the house, and here is a side-entrance.  But alas! my fingers tell me that the door is shut.           *       *       *       *       *    _Charudatta_ [_who is within the house_]. Comrade, my prayer is done.  Go now and offer sacrifice to the Mothers.    _Maitreya._ No, I'm not going.    _Charudatta._ Alas!        The poor man's kinsmen do not heed his will;      The friends who loved him once, now stand afar;      His sorrows multiply; his strength is nil;      Behold! his character's bright-shining star      Fades like the waning moon; and deeds of ill      That others do, are counted to him still.                    36    And again:        No man holds converse with him; none will greet      With due respect the poor man when they meet.      Where rich men hold a feast, if he draw near,      He meets with scornful looks for looks of cheer.    [15.19. S.        Where vulgar throngs are gathered, 't is the same;      His scanty raiment wakes his heartfelt shame.      Five are the deadly sins[36] we knew before;      Alas! I find the sixth is--to be poor.                       37    And yet again:        Ah, Poverty, I pity thee, that so      To me thou clingest, as thy dearest friend;      When my poor life has met its woeful end,      I sadly wonder, whither thou wilt go.                        38    _Maitreya._ [_Betraying his embarrassment._] Well, comrade, if I must  go, at least let Radanika go with me, to keep me company.    _Charudatta._ Radanika, you are to accompany Maitreya.    _Radanika._ Yes, sir.    _Maitreya_. Mistress Radanika, do you take the offering and the  candle while I open the side-door. [_He does so._]    _Vasantasena._ It seems as if the door took pity on me and opened  of itself. I will lose no time, but enter. [_She looks in._] What? a  candle? Oh dear, oh dear! [_She puts it out with her skirt and enters._]    _Charudatta._ What was that, Maitreya?    _Maitreya._ I opened the side-door and the wind came through all  in a lump and blew out the candle. Suppose you go out by the  side-door, Radanika, and I will follow as soon as I have gone into  the courtyard and lighted the candle again.                    [_Exit._    _Sansthanaka._ Mashter! mashter! I'm looking for Vasantasena.    _Courtier._ Keep on looking, keep on looking!    _Sansthanaka._ [_Does so._] Mashter! mashter! I've caught her! I've  caught her!    _Courtier._ Idiot, you've caught me.    _Sansthanaka._ You shtand right here, mashter, and shtay where  you're put. [_He renews the search and seizes the servant._] Mashter!  mashter! I've caught her! I've caught her!    P. 31.3]    _Servant._ Master, you've caught me, your servant.    _Sansthanaka._ Mashter here, shervant here! Mashter, shervant;  shervant, mashter. Now shtay where you're put, both of you. [_He  renews the search and seizes Radanika by the hair._] Mashter! mashter!  Thish time I've caught her! I've caught Vasantasena!        Through the black night she fled, fled she;        Her garland's shmell betrayed her;      Like Chanakya caught Draupadi,        I caught her hair and shtayed her.                         39    _Courtier._        Ah, proud to be so young, so fair!        Too high thy love must not aspire;      For now thy blossom-fragrant hair,        That merits richest gems and rare,      Serves but to drag thee through the mire.                    40    _Sansth._        I've got your head, girl, got it tight,        By the hair, the locks, and the curls, too.      Now shcream, shqueak, shqueal with all your might        \"Shiva! Ishvara! Shankara! Shambhu!\"[37]                   41    _Radanika._ [_In terror._] Oh, sirs, what does this mean?    _Courtier._ You jackass! It's another voice.    _Sansthanaka._ Mashter, the wench has changed her voice, the way a  cat changes her voice, when she wants shome cream of curdled milk.    _Courtier._ Changed her voice? Strange! Yet why so strange?        She trod the stage; she learned the arts;      She studied to deceive our hearts;      And now she practises her parts.                             42    [_Enter Maitreya._]    _Maitreya._ Look! In the gentle evening breeze the flame of the  candle is fluttering like the heart of a goat that goes to the altar.    [_He approaches and discovers Radanika._] Mistress Radanika!    [17.17. S.    _Sansthanaka._ Mashter, mashter! A man! a man!    _Maitreya._ This is right, this is perfectly right, that strangers should  force their way into the house, just because Charudatta is poor.    _Radanika._ Oh, Maitreya, see how they insult me.    _Maitreya._ What! insult you? No, they are insulting us.    _Radanika._ Very well. They are insulting you, then.    _Maitreya._ But they aren't using violence?    _Radanika._ Yes, yes!    _Maitreya._ Really?    _Radanika._ Really.    _Maitreya._ [_Raising his staff angrily._] No, sir! Man, a dog will show  his teeth in his own kennel, and I am a Brahman! My staff is crooked  as my fortunes, but it can still split a dry bamboo or a rascal's pate.    _Courtier._ Have mercy, O great Brahman, have mercy.    _Maitreya._ [_Discovers the courtier._] He is not the sinner. [_Discovers  Sansthanaka._] Ah, here is the sinner. Well, you brother-in-law to  the king, Sansthanaka, you scoundrel, you coward, this is perfectly  proper, isn't it? Charudatta the good is a poor man now--true,  but are not his virtues an ornament to Ujjayini? And so men break  into his house and insult his servants!        Insult not him, laid low by poverty;        For none are counted poor by mighty fate:        Yet he who falls from virtue's high estate,      Though he be rich, no man is poor as he.                     43    _Courtier._ [_Betraying his embarrassment._] Have mercy, O great  Brahman, have mercy. We intended no insolence; we merely mistook this  lady for another. For        We sought an amorous maiden,    _Maitreya._ What! this one?    _Courtier._ Heaven forbid!                                        one whose youth        Is in the guidance of her own sweet will;      She disappeared: unconscious of the truth,        We did what seems a purposed deed of ill.                  44    P. 35.4]    I pray you, accept this all-in-all of humblest supplication. [_He drops  his sword, folds his hands, and falls at Maitreya's feet._]    _Maitreya._ Good man, rise, rise. When I reviled you, I did not know  you. Now I know you and I ask your pardon.    _Courtier._ It is I who should ask pardon. I will rise on one condition.    _Maitreya._ And that is--    _Courtier._ That you will not tell Charudatta what has happened here.    _Maitreya._ I will be silent.    _Courtier._        Brahman, this gracious act of thine        I bow my neck to bear;      For never could this sword of mine        With virtue's steel compare.                               45    _Sansthanaka._ [_Indignantly._] But mashter, what makes you fold  your hands sho helplesshly and fall at the feet of thish manikin?    _Courtier._ I was afraid.    _Sansthanaka._ What were _you_ afraid of?    _Courtier._ Of Charudatta's virtues.    _Sansthanaka._ Virtues? He? You can go into his houshe and not  find a thing to eat.    _Courtier._ No, no.        His loving-kindness unto such as we        Has brought him low at last;      From him could no man learn what insults be,        Or e'er his wealth was past.      This well-filled pool, that in its summer day      Gave others drink, itself is dried away.                     46    _Sansthanaka._ [_Impatiently._] Who is the shon of a shlave-wench  anyway?        Brave Shvetaketu is he, Pandu's child?      Or Radha's shon, the ten-necked ogre wild?      Or Indradatta? or again, is he      Shon of brave Rama and of fair Kunti?      Or Dharmaputra? Ashvatthaman bold?      Perhaps Jatayu's shelf, that vulture old?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21035"],[0,"The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch (#7)"],[1,"e,  and had succeeded fairly well in this endeavour by the time his patron  made his appearance.    \"What's the time?\" inquired that lord of creation, running his eye  rapidly round the room at the same time, to notice how his fag had done  his duty.    \"It's five minutes to eight,\" replied Charlie, after consulting me, and  highly delighted to be thus appealed to.    \"Come along to breakfast, then.  You'll have to sit at a different table  from me; but mind and wait for me afterwards, for I've got to take you  to the doctor.\"    So Charlie was conducted down to the hall to breakfast, and provided  with a humble seat at the foot of the lowest table, while Joe Halliday  made his way with all the dignity that became his years to a  distinguished place at the highest.    My master found himself among a set of noisy little boys, who amused  themselves during the greater part of the meal by interchanging volleys  of bread pellets, which much oftener missed their marks than reached  them, in consequence of which he himself came in for the brunt of the  cannonade.  Once he ventured to return one of the random shots which had  found its way to his fingers.  Fortune favoured his aim, and his shaft  hit the boy it was intended for full in the eye.    \"Who did that?\" cried the wounded hero sharply.    \"I did,\" replied Charlie, quite proud of his achievement.    \"All right, I'll punch your head for it when we get outside.\"    This was by no means what Charlie had expected.  He had imagined the  wound would be received in the same spirit of jest in which it was  aimed.    \"It was only in fun,\" he explained; \"did it hurt you?\"    \"Of course it did,\" exclaimed the injured youth, who till Charlie's  arrival had been the junior pupil of the school, and was now delighted  to find some one below himself in the scale of seniority.  \"Of course it  did, and you'll catch it.\"    All the other boys laughed, and Charlie, who could not find it in him to  be overawed by even so majestic a hero as little Master Johnny Walker,  made the best of his position.    \"Look here,\" he said, \"I'll give you three shots at my mouth, and if  you--\"    \"There's too much talking at table six!\" exclaimed an awful voice, and  instantly every voice was hushed, including Charlie's, who blushed to  the roots of his hair, and felt as if he had been singled out before the  whole school as a rioter.  He gulped down his breakfast without further  argument with Master Walker, and was relieved, when the meal was over,  to find that that doughty warrior appeared to have altered his mind  about punching his youthful head.    After some time he saw Halliday beckoning to him from the other side of  the room.    \"Now you've got to go to the doctor,\" said he; \"come along.\"    This was the first time my master had fully realised the solemn nature  of the approaching interview, and I felt his heart flutter as he  inquired,--    \"I say, what will he say to me?\"    \"Oh, all sorts of things; you'd better mind what you're up to, I can  tell you,\" was the reassuring reply.    \"Do you think I shall get in a row for driving the cab yesterday?\"  faltered Charlie.    \"Shouldn't wonder,\" was the reply.    \"Oh, dear!  And do you think he saw me hit Johnny Walker in the eye at  breakfast?\"    \"What, were you the boy who was kicking up all that row?  My eye! you're  in for it!  Here you are; I'll knock for you.\"    And giving the poor trembling boy not so much as an instant in which to  collect his flurried ideas, Joe gave a rap at the door, which was  answered at once by a sharp \"Come in!\" from within.    \"Now then,\" said Halliday, \"in you go.\"    Charlie's knees shook under him, and he hung back from that awful door  in mute terror.    \"Come in!\" again cried the voice.    \"Do you hear, you young muff?\" exclaimed Halliday.  \"Won't you catch it!  Go in, will you?\"    And opening the door himself he fairly pushed my poor master into the  head master's study.    Fancy the agony of the poor boy, fully believing himself a doomed  miscreant, entering for the first time the awful presence of the head  master of Randlebury School.    He stood there with downcast eyes, not daring to speak, and rooted to  the spot.    \"Why, what's the matter, my boy?\"    At the words Charlie started like one electrified.  He had surely heard  that voice before somewhere!  He looked up, and what was his  astonishment to find in his dreaded principal no other than the  gentleman with whom he had yesterday spent such a friendly hour in the  train between Gunborough and Randlebury!    And his face was as kind as ever, and his voice encouraging, as he  repeated,--    \"What's the matter, my man? has the watch stopped.\"    \"Oh, sir,\" said Charlie, running up to him, \"I am glad it's you, and I'm  so sorry I drove the cab, and hit Walker in the eye.  I'll never do it  again!\"    \"Tut, tut,\" said the head master; \"if you never do any worse than that,  you won't go far wrong.  I didn't tell you who I was yesterday, because  I wanted you to manage for yourself, and fight your own battle on first  arriving.  Now tell me how you have got on.\"    And Charlie faithfully recounted to him everything, including my sudden  indisposition, and my cure by Tom Drift.    Dr Weldon (for that was his name) listened to his story, and then  said,--    \"Well, you've made a pretty good beginning.  Now try to remember this:  your father has sent you here for two reasons; one is that your head may  be furnished, and the other is that your character may be trained.  I  and your teachers can undertake the first; but it depends chiefly on you  how the second succeeds.  You will constantly be having to choose for  yourself between what is right and what is wrong, and between what is  true and what is false.  Take the advice of one who has passed through  all the temptations you are likely to meet here--rely always on a wisdom  that is better than your own, and when once you see which way duty  calls, follow that way as if your life depended on it.  Do this, and  you'll turn out a far better man than the man who is talking to you.  Whenever you are in trouble come to me, I shall always be glad to see  you.  I promised you, you know, I would ask for you occasionally, didn't  I?  And now let's see what you've got in your head.\"    And then followed a brief examination, conducted in a way which put  Charlie quite at his ease, and so enabled him to acquit himself with a  fair amount of credit and win from his master a commendation, which he  prized not a little, for it was that his father's efforts had not been  wasted on him.    \"You will be put in the second-form,\" said the doctor, \"and if you work  hard, I see no reason why you should not get up into the third next  midsummer.  Now, good-bye.  I hope you won't find the head master of  Randlebury is as `stiff and stuck-up a fellow' as you dreaded, and I  trust I shall find you as honest and brave a fellow as I hoped you would  turn out the first time I saw you.  Good-bye.\"    Charlie rose to leave with overflowing heart.  He even forgot in the  midst of his pleasant emotion to inquire, as he had fully intended to  do, after the doctor's watch, and if it was still a quarter of an hour  fast.    As he left the room he could not help contrasting with thankfulness his  present state of mind with that in which he had entered it an hour ago.  He laughed at himself for all his foolish fears then, and as for the  future, that seemed now ever so much easier and brighter.    Outside the door he found Tom Drift passing along the corridor in a  state of great excitement.    \"The very chap, I declare,\" cried he.  \"I say, lend us your watch, young  un, will you?\"    \"What for?\" asked Charlie.    \"Only a time race.  Tom Shadbolt says he can run a mile in 4.40.  I say  he can't do it under 4.50, and we've got a bet of half-a-crown a side  upon it.  So lend us your watch to time him by.\"    Charlie hesitated, and a pang passed through his breast.  He knew that  one of the things which he had promised his father was that he would  have nothing to do with betting or gambling in any form, and how could  he obey in this respect if he now lent me for the purpose for which I  was required?  And yet he owed Tom Drift no common gratitude for the  good service he had done in setting me right yesterday, and surely if  any one had a right to borrow me it was he.  The struggle was a sore  one, but soon decided.    \"I can't lend it you, Tom Drift.\"    \"Why ever not?\" asked Tom sharply.    \"I'm very sorry; if it had been anything else--but I promised father I  would not gamble.\"    \"Young ass! who wants you to gamble?  I only want you to lend us your  watch.\"    \"_You_ are gambling, though,\" said Charlie timidly.    \"And what's that got to do with you, you young idiot,\" exclaimed Drift,  fairly losing his temper, \"if I am?\"    \"I'm very sorry,\" said Charlie, \"especially as you put it all right.  If  it was anything else; but I can't for this.\"    \"Look here,\" said Drift in a fury, \"we've had fooling enough.  Hand me  the watch this moment, or I'll take it and smash it, and you into the  bargain!\"    \"Oh, Tom Drift, don't do that.  I would so gladly for anything else, but  I promised father--\"    \"Once more, will you, or will you not?\"    \"I can't.\"    \"Then take that!\" and next moment Charlie received a blow full on the  chest, which sent him staggering back against the wall.    Oh, how he wished that moment he had never owned me!    Tom came upon him with an angry oath, and seized him by the throat.    \"Will you give it up?\"    \"No,\" replied Charlie.    He was fairly roused now; no boy--certainly no boy of his sort--can  stand quietly by and receive undeserved blows.  Tom tightened his grip  on the boy's throat, and strove to snatch me from his pocket.    Quick as thought Charlie threw his arms round him, and, though the  smaller boy of the two, extricated himself from the clutch of the bully,  and sent him in turn staggering "]]]
