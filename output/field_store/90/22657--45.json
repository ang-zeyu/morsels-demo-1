Moreover, the horns of the crescent-shaped images will be in  the reverse direction to the horns of the actual crescent of the Sun at  the moment, the rays of the Sun crossing as they pass through the  foliage, just as if each interstice were a lens.    Supposing there are some spots on the Sun at a time when an eclipse is  in progress the Moon's passage over these spots may as well be noticed.  In bygone years some amount of attention was devoted to this matter with  the view of ascertaining whether any alteration took place in the  appearance of the spots; distortion, for instance, such as might be  produced by the intervention of a lunar atmosphere. No such distortion  was ever noticed, and observations with this idea in view may be said to  possess now only an academic interest, for it may be regarded as a  well-established fact that the Moon has no atmosphere.    During the passage of the Moon over Sun-spots an opportunity is afforded  of comparing the blackness, or perhaps we should rather say, the  intensity of the shade of a Sun-spot with the blackness of the Moon's  disc. Testimony herein is unanimous that the blackness of the Moon  during the stages of partial eclipse is intense compared with the  darkest parts of a Sun-spot; and this, be it remembered, in spite of the  fact that during the partial phase the atmosphere between the observer  and the Sun is brilliantly illuminated, whilst the Moon itself, being  exposed to Earth-shine, is by no means absolutely devoid of all  illumination.    When the Moon is passing across the Sun there have often been noticed  along the limb of the Moon fringes of colour, and dark and bright bands.  This might not necessarily be a real appearance for it is conceivable  that such traces of colour might be due to the telescopes employed not  having been truly achromatic, that is, not sufficiently corrected for  colour; but making every allowance for this possible source of mistake  there yet remains proof that the colour which has often been seen has  been real.    As to whether the Moon's limb can be seen during a partial eclipse, or  during the partial phase of what is to be a total eclipse, the evidence  is somewhat conflicting. There is no doubt that when the totality is  close at hand the Moon's limb can be seen projected on the Corona  (presently to be described); but the question is, whether the far-off  limb of the Moon can be detected in the open sky whilst something like  full daylight still prevails on the Earth. Undoubtedly the preponderance  of evidence is against the visibility of the Moon as a whole, under such  circumstances; but there is nevertheless some testimony to the contrary.  A French observer, E. Liais, said that three photographic plates of the  eclipse of 1858 seen in S. America all showed the outer limb of the  Moon with more or less distinctness. This testimony, be it noted, is  photographic and not visual; and on the whole it seems safest to say  that there is very small probability of the Moon as a whole ever being  seen under the circumstances in question.    What has just been said concerns the visibility of the Moon during quite  the early, or on the other hand during quite the late, stages of a total  eclipse. Immediately before or after totality the visibility of the  whole contour of the Moon is a certain fact; and the only point upon  which there is a difference of opinion is as to what are the time-limits  beyond which the Moon must not be expected to be seen. The various  records are exceedingly contradictory: perhaps the utmost that can be  said is that the whole Moon must not be expected to be visible till  about 20 minutes before totality, or for more than 5 minutes after  totality--but it must be admitted that these figures are very uncertain  in regard to any particular eclipse.    It has been sometimes noticed when the crescent of the Sun had become  comparatively small, say that the Sun was about 7/8ths covered, that the  uncovered portion exhibited evident colour which has been variously  described as \"violet,\" \"brick-red,\" \"reddish,\" \"pink,\" \"orange,\"  \"yellowish.\" The observations on this point are not very numerous and,  as will appear from the statement just made, are not very consistent;  still it seems safe to assume that a hue, more or less reddish, does  often pervade the uncovered portion of a partially-eclipsed Sun.    The remark just made as regards the Sun seems to have some application  to the Moon. There are a certain number of instances on record that what  is commonly spoken of as the black body of the Moon does, under certain  circumstances, display traces of red which has been variously spoken of  as \"crimson,\" \"dull coppery,\" \"reddish-brownish\" and \"dull glowing  coal.\"                                   SHADOW BANDS.    Let us suppose that we have a chance of observing a total eclipse of the  Sun; have completed all our preliminary preparations; have taken note of  everything which needs to be noted or suggests itself for that purpose  up till nearly the grand climax; and that the clock tells us that we are  within, say, five minutes of totality. Somewhere about this time perhaps  we shall be able to detect, dancing across the landscape, singular wavy  lines of light and shade. These are the \"Shadow Bands,\" as they are  called. The phrase is curiously inexplicit, but seemingly cannot be  improved upon at present because the philosophy of these  appearances--their origin and the laws which regulate their  visibility--are unknown, perhaps because amid the multitude of other  things to think about sufficient attention has hitherto not been paid to  the study of them. These shadow bands are most striking if a high  plastered wall, such as the front of a stone or stuccoed house, is in  their track as a screen to receive them. The shadow bands seem to vary  both in breadth and distance apart at different eclipses, and also in  the speed with which they pass along. Though, as already stated, little  is known of their origin yet they may be conceived to be due to  irregularities in the atmospheric refraction of the slender beam of  light coming from the waning or the waxing crescent of the Sun, for be  it understood they may be visible after totality as well as before it.  It is to be remarked that they have never been photographed.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--SHADOW BANDS.]    In addition to the shadow bands there are instances on record of the  limbs of the Sun's crescent appearing to undulate violently on the  approach of totality. These undulations were noticed by Airy in 1842  about 6 minutes before totality. Blake, in America in 1869, observed the  same phenomenon 8 minutes before totality. In other cases the interval  would seem to have been very much shorter--a mere matter of seconds. A  very singular observation was made in 1858 by Mr. J. D. Smith at Laycock  Abbey, Wiltshire, on the occasion of the annular eclipse of that year.  He says[13]:--\"Both my brother and myself were distinctly impressed with  the conviction that the withdrawal of light was not continuous, but by  pulsations, or, as it were, waves of obscuration, the darkness  increasing by strokes which sensibly smote the eye, and were repeated  distinctly some five or seven times after we had remarked the phenomenon  and before the time of greatest obscuration. This did not occur on the  return of light, which came back continuously and without shock or  break.\" Ruemker mentions that though this phenomenon was very apparent to  the naked eye it was not visible in the telescope.    Faint rays or brushes of light sometimes seem to spring from the  diminishing crescent of the Sun. These rays generally are very transient  and not very conspicuous, and perhaps must be distinguished as regards  both their appearance and their origin from the more striking rays  which are usually seen a few minutes before or after totality, and which  are generally associated with, or even deemed to belong to, the Corona.  Fig. 7 represents these rays as seen in Spain on July 18, 1860, some  minutes after totality. They are described as having been well defined,  but at some moments more marked than at others, and though well-defined  yet constantly varying. Radiations of light more or less of the  character just described may probably be regarded as a standing feature  of every total eclipse.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--RAYS OF LIGHT SEEN NEAR THE TIME OF TOTALITY.]                             THE APPROACH OF TOTALITY.    The next thing to think about and to look out for is the approach of the  Moon's shadow. I have mentioned this already,[14] and also the  appalling velocity with which it seems to approach. By this time the  coming darkness, which characterises every total phase, will have  reached an advanced stage of development. The darkness begins to be  felt. The events which manifest themselves at this juncture on the Earth  (rather than in the sky around the Sun) are so graphically described by  the American writer whom I have already quoted, and who writes,  moreover, from personal experience, that I cannot do better than  transfer her striking account to my pages.[15] \"Then, with frightful  velocity, the actual shadow of the Moon is often seen approaching, a  tangible darkness advancing almost like a wall, swift as imagination,  silent as doom. The immensity of nature never comes quite so near as  then, and strong must be the nerves not to quiver as this blue-black  shadow rushes upon the spectator with incredible speed. A vast, palpable  presence seems overwhelming the world. The blue sky changes to gray or  dull purple, speedily becoming more dusky, and a death-like trance  seizes upon everything earthly. Birds, with terrified cries,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24236"],[0,"Time and Tide: A Romance of the Moon (#7)"],[1," speed of the fly-wheel does not slacken. The earth, however,  must be likened to a fly-wheel which has been disconnected with the  engine. If, therefore, the earth have to supply certain demands on its  accumulation of energy, it can only do so by a diminution of its  hoard, and this involves a sacrifice of some of its speed.    In the earth-moon system there is no engine at hand to restore the  losses of energy which are inevitable when work has to be done. But we  have seen that work is done; we have shown, in fact, that the tides  are at present doing work, and have been doing work for as long a  period in the past as our imagination can extend to. The energy which  this work has necessitated can only have been drawn from the existing  store in the system; that energy consists of two parts--the  moon-energy and the earth's rotation energy. The problem therefore for  us to consider is, which of these two banks the tides have drawn on to  meet their constant expenditure. This is not a question that can be  decided offhand; in fact, if we attempt to decide it in an offhand  manner we shall certainly go wrong. It seems so very plausible to say  that as the moon causes the tides, therefore the energy which these  tides expend should be contributed by the moon. But this is not the  case. It actually happens that though the moon does cause the tides,  yet when those tides consume energy they draw it not from the distant  moon, but from the vast supply which they find ready to their hand,  stored up in the rotation of the earth.    The demonstration of this is not a very simple matter; in fact, it is  so far from being simple that many philosophers, including some  eminent ones too, while admitting that of course the tides must have  drawn their energy from one or other or both of these two sources, yet  found themselves unable to assign how the demand was distributed  between the two conceivable sources of supply.    We are indebted to Professor Purser of Belfast for having indicated  the true dynamical principle on which the problem depends. It involves  reasoning based simply on the laws of motion and on elementary  mathematics, but not in the least involving questions of astronomical  observation. It would be impossible for me in a lecture like this to  give any explanation of the mathematical principles referred to. I  shall, however, endeavour by some illustrations to set before you what  this profound principle really is. Were I to give it the old name I  should call it the law of the conservation of areas; the more modern  writers, however, speak of it as the conservation of moment of  momentum, an expression which exhibits the nature of the principle in  a more definite manner.    I do not see how to give any very accurate illustration of what this  law means, but I must make the attempt, and if you think the  illustration beneath the dignity of the subject, I can only plead the  difficulty of mathematics as an excuse. Let us suppose that a  ball-room is fairly filled with dancers, or those willing to dance,  and that a merry waltz is being played; the couples have formed, and  the floor is occupied with pairs who are whirling round and round in  that delightful amusement. Some couples drop out for a while and  others strike in; the fewer couples there are the wider is the range  around which they can waltz, the more numerous the couples the less  individual range will they possess. I want you to realize that in the  progress of the dance there is a certain total quantity of spin at any  moment in progress; this spin is partly made up of the rotation by  which each dancer revolves round his partner, and partly of the  circular orbit about the room which each couple endeavours to  describe. If there are too many couples on the floor for the general  enjoyment of the dance, then both the orbit and the angular velocity  of each couple will be restricted by the interference with their  neighbours. We may, however, assert that so long as the dance is in  full swing the total quantity of spin, partly rotational and partly  orbital, will remain constant. When there are but few couples the  unimpeded rotation and the large orbits will produce as much spin as  when there is a much larger number of couples, for in the latter case  the diminished freedom will lessen the quantity of spin produced by  each individual pair. It will sometimes happen too that collision will  take place, but the slight diversions thus arising only increase the  general merriment, so that the total quantity of spin may be  sustained, even though one or two couples are placed temporarily _hors  de combat_. I have invoked a ball-room for the purpose of bringing out  what we may call the law of the conservation of spin. No matter how  much the individual performers may change, or no matter what  vicissitudes arise from their collision and other mutual actions, yet  the total quantity of spin remains unchanged.    Let us look at the earth-moon system. The law of the conservation of  moment of momentum may, with sufficient accuracy for our present  purpose, be interpreted to mean that the total quantity of spin in the  system remains unaltered. In our system the spin is threefold; there  is first the rotation of the earth on its axis, there is the rotation  of the moon on its axis, and then there is the orbital revolution of  the moon around the earth. The law to which we refer asserts that the  total quantity of these three spins, each estimated in the proper way,  will remain constant. It matters not that tides may ebb and flow, or  that the distribution of the spin shall vary, but its total amount  remains inflexibly constant. One constituent of the total amount--that  is, the rotation of the moon on its axis--is so insignificant, that  for our present purposes it may be entirely disregarded. We may  therefore assert that the amount of spin in the earth, due to its  rotation round its axis, added to the amount of spin in the moon due  to its revolution round the earth, remains unalterable. If one of  these quantities change by increase or by decrease, the other must  correspondingly change by decrease or by increase. If, therefore, from  any cause, the earth began to spin a little more quickly round its  axis, the moon must do a little less spin; and consequently, it must  shorten its distance from the earth. Or suppose that the earth's  velocity of rotation is abated, then its contribution to the total  amount of spin is lessened; the deficiency must therefore be made up  by the moon, but this can only be done by an enlargement of the moon's  orbit. I should add, as a caution, that these results are true only on  the supposition that the earth-moon system is isolated from all  external interference. With this proviso, however, it matters not what  may happen to the earth or moon, or what influence one of them may  exert upon the other, no matter what tides may be raised, no matter  even if the earth fly into fragments, the whole quantity of spin of  all those fragments would, if added to the spin of the moon, yield the  same unalterable total. We are here in possession of a most valuable  dynamical principle. We are not concerned with any special theory as  to the action of the tides; it is sufficient for us that in some way  or other the tides have been caused by the moon, and that being so,  the principle of the conservation of spin will apply.    Were the earth and the moon both rigid bodies, then there could be of  course no tides on the earth, it being rigid and devoid of ocean. The  rotation of the earth on its axis would therefore be absolutely  without change, and therefore the necessary condition of the  conservation of spin would be very simply attained by the fact that  neither of the constituent parts changed. The earth, however, not  being entirely rigid, and being subject to tides, this simple state of  things cannot continue; there must be some change in progress.    I have already shown that the fact of the ebbing and the flowing of  the tide necessitates an expenditure of energy, and we saw that this  energy must come either from that stored up in the earth by its  rotation, or from that possessed by the moon in virtue of its distance  and revolution. The law of the conservation of spin will enable us to  decide at once as to whence the tides get their energy. Suppose they  took it from the moon, the moon would then lose in energy, and  consequently come nearer the earth. The quantity of spin contributed  by the moon would therefore be lessened, and accordingly the spin to  be made up by the earth would be increased. That means, of course,  that the velocity of the earth rotating on its axis must be increased,  and this again would necessitate an increase in the earth's rotational  energy. It can be shown, too, that to keep the total spin right, the  energy of the earth would have to gain more than the moon would have  lost by revolving in a smaller orbit. Thus we find that the total  quantity of energy in the system would be increased. This would lead  to the absurd result that the action of the tides manufactured energy  in our system. Of course, such a doctrine cannot be true; it would  amount to a perpetual motion! We might as well try to get a  steam-engine which would produce enough heat by friction not only to  supply its own boilers, but to satisfy all the thermal wants of the  whole parish. We must therefore adopt the other alternative. The tides  do not draw their energy from the moon; they draw it from the store  possessed by the earth in virtue of its rotation.    We can now state the end of this rather long discussion in a very  simple and brief manner. Energy can only be yielded by the earth at  the expense of some of the speed of its rotation. The tides must  therefore cause the earth to revolve more slowly; in other words, _the  tides are increasing the length of the day_.    The earth therefore loses some "]]]
