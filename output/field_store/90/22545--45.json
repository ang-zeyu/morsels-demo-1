Through all the tangled skein of  Gwen's character there ran, like a thread of pure gold, the intense  passionate love for her father, and the desire to preserve his good  opinion. She could not bear to see the grieved look that came into his  eyes when he was forced to reprove her. What indeed would he think of  her when he heard Beatrice's account? She pushed the potato cake away,  feeling as if she could not swallow a morsel.    Beatrice was putting Martin to bed. Better follow her now, and try to  patch up peace. She ran upstairs and met her sister coming out of the  little fellow's bedroom, candle in hand.    \"Bee! I'm awfully sorry for what I said just now! I didn't really mean  it I can't think what possessed me!\" gulped Gwen.    \"I try to do my best for you all. It's hard work sometimes to be  eldest,\" said Beatrice, and there was a quiver in her voice too. \"If  only Mother were here.\"    \"Don't!\" said Gwen huskily. \"I miss her so dreadfully still. Oh, Bee!  If only you wouldn't tell Father about this!\"    \"If I don't, will you promise faithfully always to come straight home  from school with Winnie and Lesbia, and never go anywhere without  asking?\"    \"On my honour!\"    \"Then I won't trouble him. He's enough worries, poor darling, without  adding any more to them! I only wish I could save him some of those he  already has!\"    Early next morning, long before Lesbia was awake, Gwen got up very  quietly, and unlocked her savings box. It seemed dreadfully hard to  have to take her treasured fifteen shillings; pocket money was such a  scarce article at the Parsonage that she did not know when she would  have the chance of accumulating so much again. There were only two  threepenny bits and a penny left to rattle when she shook the box, so  she sighed ruefully as she locked it, and put it back in its place on  the top shelf of the bookcase. She hoped Netta would not forget to  bring the half-sovereign she had promised to lend, though how the loan  was ever to be repaid she could not imagine. For to-day it seemed  enough if she had avoided Miss Roscoe's anger, and spared casting an  added worry on Father's already overburdened shoulders.    Netta was faithful to her word; she came to school with both the  ten-shilling piece and the half-crown which was to be her share of the  \"hush money\" for Emma. The two girls held a long whispered conference  together during the interval.    \"I can't possibly go and pay Parker's myself,\" said Gwen. \"You've no  idea what a row I got into last night for missing the bus. Winnie'll  keep an eye on me to-day at four o'clock, I can assure you. Could you  go?\"    \"Very sorry, but I've got to go straight home too. Some cousins are  coming to tea, and I have to ask Miss Evans to let me out of the  drawing class ten minutes earlier. Why not get Emma to go? We shall  have to see her to give her her tip.\"    \"A good idea,\" said Gwen. \"Emma understands all about it.\"    They found the housemaid when she was helping to lay the tables for  dinner, and managed to draw her aside for a private talk.    \"Did the fresh china come last night?\" they asked eagerly.    \"Oh, yes! it came all right, and Miss Roscoe never said a word, so you  may think yourselves lucky,\" replied Emma.    \"Here's the little present we promised you,\" said Netta, slipping the  five shillings into her hand.    \"I hardly like taking it!\" protested Emma, though she popped it  hastily into her pocket all the same.    \"Could you do something more for us?\" begged Gwen. \"Will you call at  Parker's and pay for the broken china? Here's the money--it's one  pound two and six. Neither Netta nor I can possibly go.\"    \"Oh, yes, I don't mind doing that!\" returned Emma. \"It's my night out  this evening, and I shall be down High Street, so I can easily call at  Parker's on my road. They don't close till eight o'clock.\"    \"And you promise you'll never breathe a single word to anybody about  this?\"    \"Not likely!\" declared Emma, as she turned away to finish laying her  table.    \"Well, I'm thankful that's done with,\" thought Gwen. \"It might have  been an awkward affair, and I've come out of it uncommonly well. I  feel as if I'd laid a ghost, and popped a stone on its grave.\"    It was all very well for Gwen to congratulate herself, but she quite  forgot that ghosts have an awkward habit sometimes of disregarding  tombstones, and rising from their graves to haunt those who have  interred them. The matter of the broken china was not to be so easily  disposed of as she had imagined, and though for the present her secret  seemed safe, there was trouble ahead for her in plenty.          CHAPTER V    Trouble in the Fifth      The direct result of Gwen's transaction about the china was to fling  her into the arms of Netta Goodwin. With such a secret between them it  was impossible not to be friendly, and though Netta was hardly an  ideal chum, there seemed no choice in the matter. Moreover, she was  the only one in the Fifth who had offered advances; the other girls,  still indignant at the promotion of a Junior, turned the cold  shoulder. This unfortunate intimacy caused Gwen to be banned the more.    \"I see Gwen Gascoyne has taken up with Netta Goodwin,\" said Hilda  Browne.    \"Then that stamps her,\" replied Edith Arnold. \"I wouldn't touch Netta  with a pair of tongs myself. I thought better of the Gascoynes!\"    Netta was a type of girl that can be found in every school and almost  every Form. Rather deficient in moral fibre, and badly trained at  home, her influence was always on the wrong side. She was clever  enough, as a rule, just to avoid getting into open trouble with the  authorities, but under the surface she was a source of disturbance.  She had a certain following of gigglers and slackers, who thought her  escapades funny, and were ready to act chorus to her lead, and though  she had never done anything specially outrageous, her reputation at  headquarters was not good. Every teacher realized only too plainly  that Netta was the firebrand of the Form, and that while she might  preserve a smug exterior it was really she who was responsible for any  outbreaks of lawlessness among the others.    As Junior Mistress of the Fifth no one had more reason to be aware of  this than Winnie Gascoyne. Teaching was uphill work to Winnie. She had  not Beatrice's commanding disposition and capacity for administration,  consequently it was the more difficult for her to keep order and  enforce rules. She did her conscientious best, but girls easily find  out a governess's weak point, and at present Netta was trying how far  she could go. \"Ragging Miss Gascoyne\" was a favourite pastime of hers,  and one which afforded much sport to her applauders, if not to the  victim of her jokes.    A few mornings after Gwen's introduction to the Fifth there was a  class for memory map drawing with the assistant teacher. Each girl was  supposed to come prepared to make a map of India, and to mark in a  large number of places, a fairly difficult task, and one over which  many of them grumbled in unison.    \"It's not fair! It takes such heaps of time to go over it at home, one  hasn't a second for anything else!\" wailed Minna Jennings.    \"I'd a raging headache last night, and my mother said she thought  Rodenhurst was getting too much for me,\" bleated Millicent Cooper.    \"Poor frail flower! You look as if you'd wither at a breath! Better  pack you off to a sanatorium!\" laughed Netta.    \"And you to a lunatic asylum, you mad thing! Don't you ever get  headaches with all this over-swatting?\"    \"No, my child, for I know a dodge or two! N. G. is no infant in arms,  I assure you.\"    \"Deign to explain, O commander of the faithful!\" begged Annie Edwards.    \"Well, as I told you, I'm up to a thing or two, and I flatter myself I  know just exactly how to tackle Grinnie.\"    \"Who's Grinnie?\" asked Gwen rather sharply.    The others roared.    \"My sweet babe, my dear ex-Junior, let us initiate you into the  shibboleths of the Fifth! Yes, Seniors indulge in their little  nicknames as well as the Lower School, though perhaps we are rather  more cultured in our choice of them. Be it known to you then that our  respected Head, vulgarly called The Bogey by ill-trained Juniors, is  among our elect set yclept Lemonade, partly owing to her habit of  fizzing over, and partly to a certain acid quality in her temper,  otherwise hard to define. Miss Douglas, our honoured Form mistress,  being a canny Scot, goes by the familiar appellation of Thistles,  intended also to subtly convey our appreciation--or shall I say  depreciation?--of her prickly habit.\"    \"And Grinnie?\" continued Gwen.    \"Your sister, by her perpetual smile, courted the title.\"    \"It's no good exploding, Gwen!\" said Annie Edwards. \"If you've got a  sister who's a teacher you'll just have to hear her called nicknames.  You don't suppose we're going to shut up on your account?\"    \"And you needn't go sneaking, either, or it'll be the worse for you,\"  added Minna Jennings.    \"We'd soon know who'd told tales,\" snapped Millicent Cooper.    \"Peace, turbulent herd!\" said Netta, holding up her hand. \"Our friend  Gwen, being of a sensible disposition, and a lover, like ourselves, of  all wholesome jests, fully realizes the exigencies of her peculiar  situation. Though in the seclusion of her home she may be bound by  many natural ties, family obligations cease entirely in the classroom.  If her sister is a mistress, she is a pupil, and therefore bound to  side with her Form through all those trials of tact known as 'thick  and thin'. Have I not put the thing in a nutshell, O Gwendolen mine?\"    Gwen could not help laughing, for there was undoubted truth in Netta's  argument. Winnie would, she knew, treat her with the utmost  impartiality, probably even more strictly, owing to their  relationship. It would certainly never do if she were to be regarded  as a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21688"],[0,"Scottish Cathedrals and Abbeys (#7)"],[1," completed in the time of  Bishop Wardlaw (1404-1440), who in 1430 improved the interior by the  introduction of fine pavements in the choir, transept, and nave, and by  filling the nave with stained glass and building a large window in the  eastern gable. The south wall of the nave extends considerably westwards  beyond the present west end, and contains the remains of a vaulting  shaft, leading to the inference that the Cathedral was originally of  greater length than it now is by at least 34 feet. The north wall of  nave also projects westwards about 7 feet. There is a difficulty in  connection with the west front, and it is regarded by competent  authorities that this wall was not part of a western porch, but  \"indicates that there has been a change in the design, and that the  original intention of having a wide porch extending along the whole of  the west end has been departed from after the first story was built up  to the level of the above string course, all above that point being of  later design and execution.\"[44]    The early chapter-house was 26 feet square, and was vaulted with four  central pillars. It opened to the cloisters, and the doorway is  pronounced to be in the purest style of early pointed architecture.[45]  Bishop Lamberton (1298-1328) erected a new chapter-house, and the old  one was made a vestibule to the new. South of the early chapter-house  was probably the fratery; on the upper floor of this building and the  chapter-house was the dormitory--a wheel-stair leading to it from the  south transept. On the west side of the cloister was the sub-prior's  house, known also as Senzie House; south-east of the fratery is the  prior's house or Hospitium Vetus, which was sometimes the residence of  the bishop. West of the cathedral are the remains of the entrance  gateway, called the \"Pends,\" and in continuation of the \"Pends\" was the  enclosing wall of the priory grounds, containing sixteen towers. The  Guest-House was within the precinct of St. Leonard's College, and was  built about the middle of the thirteenth century.[46] Within the  precincts of the Priory-grounds were the various offices connected with  the great ecclesiastical establishment.    The conventual and other buildings attached to the Cathedral have been  recently excavated at the expense of the late Marquis of Bute, and  considerable remains of the foundations disclosed to view. The ruins of  the castle stand on a rocky promontory, overhanging the sea, N.N.W. of  the Cathedral; and between the Cathedral-wall on the N.E. and the sea  are the foundations of a chapel dedicated to the Virgin.    In 1559 the Cathedral was attacked by the mob and greatly destroyed.  Time and weather helped to complete the work of destruction; the  Protestant Archbishop Spottiswoode in 1635 strove to make provision for  its restoration, but nothing appears to have been done to arrest the  work of destruction. The Barons of Exchequer in 1826 took possession of  the ruins, had the rubbish cleared away, and what remained of the great  building strengthened. The pier-bases have been made visible, and the  outline of the building marked on the turf. St. Andrews has been  associated with most of the stirring events in Scottish Church history,  and will always possess its two great voices of the Cathedral and the  Sea.      2. DIOCESE OF GLASGOW    Towards the end of the fourth century, St. Ninian, a Christian  missionary trained at Rome in the doctrine and discipline of the Western  Church, is said to have established a religious cell on the banks of the  Molendinar. How long he remained there is uncertain, but his labours are  chiefly centred around the Candida Casa at Whithorn and among the  southern Picts, whose district, according to Bede, he evangelised. With  St. Ninian's departure, the district around the Molendinar relapsed into  barbarism, and the only remaining monument of his work was a cemetery  which he was reputed to have consecrated. The next historical reference  to Glasgow is in connection with St. Kentigern, or, as he was popularly  known, St. Mungo, about the middle of the sixth century. He was of royal  descent, and was born in 518 or 527. His biographer, Joceline, states  that he was adopted and educated by St. Servanus or St. Serf, who lived  at Culross, and by him was named \"Munghu,\" _i.e._ dearest friend. But  this must be a mistake, for Servanus lived two centuries after  Kentigern's time;[47] if it is correct, there must have been an earlier  and a later St. Serf. On attaining his twenty-fifth year, according to  Joceline, he proceeded to Carnock, where lived a holy man named Fergus.  After he reached the abode of Fergus, the good man said his \"nunc  dimittis\" and died; and Kentigern, placing his body on a wain drawn by  two bulls, took his departure, praying to be guided to the place which  might be appointed for burial. The place where the wain stopped was  Cathures, afterwards called Glasgow, where St. Ninian had consecrated a  cemetery, and here Fergus was buried. Such is Joceline's account of  Kentigern's first connection with Glasgow. The king and people of the  district pressed him to remain as their bishop, and he consented,  establishing his see at Cathures and founding a lay society of the  servants of God, and fixing his own abode on the banks of the  Molendinar. After some years of austerity and beneficence there, he was  driven from his work by the persecutions of an apostate prince and  settled in the vale of Clwyd, North Wales, where he founded a monastery.  After a time he returned to Glasgow, at the solicitation of the King of  Cumbria, and appointed St. Asaph as his successor in Wales. In a  martyrology ascribed to the year 875 Kentigern appears as \"bishop of  Glasgow and confessor.\"[48] While resident at Glasgow, St. Kentigern was  visited by St. Columba, his distinguished contemporary and the apostle  of the Picts, who presented him with a crozier, which, Fordun says, was  afterwards preserved in St. Wilfrid's Church at Ripon. Bishop Forbes  describes the meeting of the two great men \"as one of those incidents  which we wish to be true, and which we have no certainty for believing  not to be so.\"[49] St. Kentigern died in 603 or 614, and was buried in  Glasgow, which is still known as the city of St. Mungo--Mungo being his  name of honour or affection. Everything connected with St. Mungo's early  church, of wood and wattles or of stone, on the banks of the Molendinar,  is shrouded in the mists of antiquity until the first quarter of the  twelfth century, when David, Prince and Earl of Cumbria, the youngest  son of Queen Margaret, took measures to reconstruct the see and recover  its property. Of Glasgow during the Culdee period nothing can be  definitely known. The result of Prince David's inquest is contained in  the _Register_ of the Bishopric,[50] and it sets forth that Prince  David, from love to God and by the exhortation of the Bishop, having  caused inquiry to be made concerning the lands belonging to the church  in Cumbria, had ascertained that they belonged to the church of Glasgow,  and restored them. These lands extended from the Clyde on the north to  the Solway and English March on the south, from the western boundary of  Lothian on the east to the river Urr on the west, including Teviotdale,  and comprehended what afterwards formed the site of the city of  Glasgow.[51] The building of the cathedral would appear to have been  begun before David succeeded to the throne in 1124, and he appointed his  tutor John (called Achaius) to the bishopric. In 1136 the church, which  was probably chiefly of wood, was dedicated, and King David endowed it  further with lands, tithes, and churches. The church of Achaius was  destroyed by fire, but through the exertions of Bishop Joceline a  society was founded to collect funds for its restoration, and the work  was sufficiently advanced for its consecration on 6th July 1197.[52]  Although built at different dates, the building has a very homogeneous  appearance, and might be mistaken for a building of one period. Under  competent guidance,[53] we now propose to give a short sketch of the  cathedral itself.    The first attempt to erect a cathedral was made by Bishop Achaius, whose  episcopate extended from 1115 to 1147, and Mr. Honeyman regards the  portion of the lower church at the south-west angle as the most ancient  part of the structure. He holds that the church built by Achaius was  restored by Bishop Joceline (1175-1199) at the end of the twelfth  century, and that the above portion formed a chapel, and was part of  that restoration. The strongest argument is its nearness to the tomb of  the patron saint. If we assume that the old choir terminated in a  semicircular apse, projecting eastward beyond the aisles, we shall find  that the tomb would be enclosed in such a position as to admit of the  high altar being placed immediately over it. Assuming that the choir was  not apsidal but square, we get the same result. The probability is that  the end of the church erected or altered by Joceline was square, and  that it projected two bays beyond the aisles, as at St. Andrews and  other churches of the same period.[54] The crypt, or, strictly speaking,  \"lower church,\" was evidently suggested by the sloping eastward  character of the site, which would have placed St. Mungo's tomb at a  depth below the level on which a large church could possibly be built;  while Achaius, from his long residence in Italy, would be led to imitate  some notable Italian examples.[55] Some similarities between Glasgow and  Jedburgh (which was in the diocese of Glasgow) have suggested that there  was in the olden times such a servant of the church as a diocesean  architect.[56] \"One thing is abundantly clear,\" says Mr. Honeyman, \"to  any one who intelligently studies the building, namely, that the whole  design was carefully thought out and settled before a stone was laid.
