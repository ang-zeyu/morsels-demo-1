'An Uncle's rage must seek relief,      His anger must be drowned;    It is to soothe an Uncle's grief      That thus I plunge and bound.      'I bound and plunge, I seethe with rage,      My mighty anger seeks    So much relief that I engage      To plunge and bound for weeks.'    Seeing that there was no possibility of inducing Uncle Wattleberry to  look at the affair in a reasonable light, they walked off and left him  to continue his bounding and plunging for the amusement of the people of  Bungledoo, who brought their chairs out on to the footpath in order to  enjoy the sight at their ease. Bill's intention to regard everybody he  met with suspicion was somewhat damped by this mistake, and he said  there ought to be a law to prevent a man going about looking as if he  was a disguised puddin'-thief.    The most annoying part of it all was that when the puddin'-thieves did  make their appearance they weren't disguised at all. They were dressed  as common ordinary puddin'-thieves, save that the Possum carried a bran  bag in his hand and the Wombat waved a white flag.    [Illustration]    'Well, if this isn't too bad,' shouted Bill, enraged. 'What d'you mean,  comin' along in this unexpected way without bein' disguised?'    'No, no,' sang out the Possum. 'No disguises to-day.'    'No fighting, either,' said the Wombat.    'No disguises, no fighting, and no puddin'-stealing,' said the Possum.  'Nothing but the fairest and most honourable dealings.'    [Illustration]    'If you ain't after our Puddin', what are you after?' demanded Bill.    'We're after bringing you a present in this bag,' said the Possum.    'Absurd,' said Bill. 'Puddin'-thieves don't give presents away.'    'Don't say that, Bill,' said the Possum, solemnly. 'If you only knew  what noble intentions we have, you'd be ashamed of them words.'    [Illustration]    'You'd blush to hear your voice a-utterin' of them,' said the Wombat.    'I can't make this out at all,' said Bill, scratching his head. 'The  idea of a puddin'-thief offering a man a present dumbfounds me, as the  saying goes.'    'No harm is intended,' said the Possum, and the Wombat added: 'Harm is  as far from our thoughts as from the thoughts of angels.'    'Well, well,' said Bill, at length. 'I'll just glance at it first, to  see what it's like.'    But the Possum shook his head. 'No, no, Bill,' he said, 'no glancing,'  and the Wombat added: 'To prove that no deception is intended, all heads  must look in the bag together.'    'What's to be done about this astoundin' predicament?' said Bill. 'If  there is a present, of course we may as well have it. If there ain't a  present, of course we shall simply have to punch their snouts as  usual.'    'One must confess,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'to the prompting of a certain  curiosity as to the nature of this present'; and Sam added, 'Anyway,  there's no harm in having a look at it.'    'No harm whatever,' said the Possum, and he held the bag open  invitingly. The Puddin'-owners hesitated a moment, but the temptation  was too strong, and they all looked in together. It was a fatal act. The  Possum whipped the bag over their heads, the Wombat whipped a rope round  the bag, and there they were, helpless.    [Illustration]    The worst of it was that the Puddin', being too short to look in, was  left outside, and the puddin'-thieves grabbed him at once and ran off  like winking. To add to the Puddin'-owners' discomfiture there was a  considerable amount of bran in the bag; and, as Bill said afterwards,  'if there's anything worse than losing a valuable Puddin', it's bran in  the whiskers'. They bounded and plunged about, but soon had to stop that  on account of treading on each other's toes--especially Sam's, who  endured agonies, having no boots on.    [Illustration]    'What a frightful calamity,' groaned Bill giving way to despair.    'It's worse than being chased by natives on the Limpopo River,' said  Sam.    'It's worse than fighting Arabs single-handed,' croaked Bill.    'It's almost as bad as being pecked on the head by eagles,' said Sam,  and in despair they sang in muffled tones--      'O what a fearful fate it is,      O what a frightful fag,    To have to walk about like this      All tied up in a bag.      'Our noble confidence has sent      Us on this fearful jag;    In noble confidence we bent      To look inside this bag.      'Deprived of air, in dark despair    Upon our way we drag;    Condemned for evermore to wear    This frightful, fearsome bag.'    Bunyip Bluegum reproved this faint-heartedness, saying, 'As our  misfortunes are due to exhibiting too great a trust in scoundrels, so  let us bear them with the greater fortitude. As in innocence we fell, so  let our conduct in this hour of dire extremity be guided by the  courageous endurance of men whose consciences are free from guilt.'    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    These fine words greatly stimulated the others, and they endured with  fortitude, walking on Sam's feet for an hour and a half, when the sound  of footsteps apprised them that a traveller was approaching.    This traveller was a grave, elderly dog named Benjimen Brandysnap, who  was going to market with eggs. Seeing three people walking in a bag he  naturally supposed they were practising for the sports, but on hearing  their appeals for help he very kindly undid the rope.    'Preserver,' exclaimed Bill, grasping him by the hand.    'Noble being,' said Sam.    'Guardian angel of oppressed Puddin'-owners,' said Bunyip Bluegum.    Benjimen was quite overcome by these expressions of esteem, and handed  round eggs, which were eaten on the spot.    'And now,' said Bill, again shaking hands with their preserver, 'I am  about to ask you a most important question. Have you seen any  puddin'-thieves about this mornin'?'    'Puddin'-thieves,' said Benjimen. 'Let me see. Now that you mention it,  I remember seeing two puddin'-thieves at nine-thirty this morning. But  they weren't stealing puddin's. They were engaged stealing a bag out of  my stable. I was busy at the time whistling to the carrots, or I'd have  stopped them.'    'This is most important information,' said Bill. 'It proves this must be  the very bag they stole. In what direction did the scoundrels go,  friend, after stealing your bag?'    'As I was engaged at the moment feeding the parsnips, I didn't happen to  notice,' said Benjimen. 'But at this season puddin'-thieves generally go  south-east, owing to the price of onions.'    'In that case,' said Bill, 'we shall take a course north-west, for it's  my belief that havin' stolen our Puddin' they'll make back to winter  quarters.'    'We will pursue to the north-west with the utmost vigour,' said Bunyip.    'Swearin' never to give in till revenge has been inflicted and our  Puddin' restored to us,' said Bill.    'In order to exacerbate our just anger,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'let us  sing as we go--    THE PUDDIN'-OWNERS' QUEST      'On a terrible quest we run north-west,      In a terrible rage we run;    With never a rest we run north-west      Till our terrible work is done.        Without delay        Away, away,    In a terrible rage we run all day.      'By our terrible zest you've doubtless guessed      That vengeance is our work;    For we seek the nest with terrible zest      Where the puddin'-snatchers lurk.        With rage, with gloom,        With fret and fume,    We seek the puddin'-snatchers' doom.'    [Illustration]    They ran north-west for two hours without seeing a sign of the  puddin'-thieves. Benjimen ran with them to exact revenge for the theft  of his bag. It was hot work running, and having no Puddin' they couldn't  have lunch, but Benjimen very generously handed eggs all round again.    'Eggs is all very well,' said Bill, eating them in despair, 'but they  don't come up to Puddin' as a regular diet, and all I can say is, that  if that Puddin' ain't restored soon I shall go mad with grief.'    'I shall go mad with rage,' said Sam, and they both sang loudly--      'Go mad with grief or mad with rage,      It doesn't matter whether;    Our Puddin's left this earthly stage,    So in despair we must engage      To both go mad together.'    'I have a suggestion to make,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'which will at once  restore your wonted good-humour. Observe me.'    He looked about till he found a piece of board, and wrote this notice on  it with his fountain pen--             A GRAND PROCESSION OF        THE AMALGAMATED SOCIETY OF          PUDDINGS WILL PASS HERE             AT 2.30 TO-DAY    This he hung on a tree. 'Now,' said he, 'all that remains to be done is  to hide behind this bush. The news of the procession will spread like  wildfire through the district, and the puddin'-thieves, unable to resist  such a spectacle, will come hurrying to view the procession. The rest  will be simply a matter of springing out on them like lions.'    'Superbly reasoned,' said Bill, grasping Bunyip by the hand.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    They all hid behind the bush and a crow, who happened to be passing,  read the sign and flew off at once to spread the news through the  district.    In fifteen minutes, by Bill's watch, the puddin'-thieves came running  down the road, and took up a position on a stump to watch the  procession. They had evidently been disturbed in the very act of eating  Puddin', for the Possum was still masticating a mouthful; and the Wombat  had stuck the Puddin' in his hat, and put his hat on his head, which  clearly proved him to be a very ill-bred fellow, for in good society  wearing puddin's on the head is hardly ever done.    [Illustration]    Bill and Sam, who were like bloodhounds straining at the leash, sprang  out and confronted the scoundrels, while Bunyip and Ben got behind in  order to cut off their retreat.

Consequently, the hardness of jewels is a matter of no small importance,  and by dint of indefatigable research, in tests and comparison, all  known precious stones have been classified in various scales or degrees  of hardness. The most popular and reliable table is that of Mohs, in  which he takes talc as the softest of the rarer minerals and classes  this as No. 1; from that he goes by gradual steps to the diamond, the  hardest of the stones, which he calls No. 10, and between these two all  other gems are placed. Here is given a complete list of Mohs's  arrangement of stones, according to their hardness, beginning at No. 1,  thus:--    Talc                                                       1  Rock salt                                                  2  Amber                                                      2-1/2  Calcite                                                    3  Malachite                                                  3-1/2  Jet                                                        3-1/2  Fluorspar                                                  4  Apatite                                                    5  Dioptase                                                   5  Kyanite (various)                                          5-7  Haueynite                                                   5-1/2  Haematite                                                   5-1/2  Lapis lazuli                                               5-1/2  Moldavite (various)                                        5-1/2-6-1/2  Rhodonite                                                  5-1/2-6-1/2  Obsidian                                                   5-1/2  Sphene                                                     5-1/2  Opal (various)                                             5-1/2-6-1/2  Nephrite                                                   5-3/4  Chrysolite                                                 6-7  Felspar                                                    6  Adularia                                                   6  Amazon stone                                               6  Diopside                                                   6  Iron pyrites                                               6  Labradorite                                                6  Turquoise                                                  6  Spodumene                                                  6-1/2-7  The Chalcedony group which embraces the Agate,      Carnelian, etc.                                        6-1/2  Demantoid                                                  6-1/2  Epidote                                                    6-1/2  Idocrase                                                   6-1/2  Garnets (see also \"Red Garnets\" below)                     6-1/2-7-1/2  Axinite                                                    6-3/4  Jadeite                                                    6-3/4  Quartz, including Rock-crystal, Amethyst, Jasper,     Chrysoprase Citrine, etc.                               7  Jade                                                       7  Dichorite (water sapphire)                                 7-7-1/2  Cordierite                                                 7-1/4  Red Garnets (see also Garnets above)                       7-1/4  Tourmaline                                                 7-1/4  Andalusite                                                 7-1/2  Euclase                                                    7-1/2  Staurolite                                                 7-1/2  Zircon                                                     7-1/2  Emerald, Aquamarine, or Beryl                              7-3/4  Phenakite                                                  7-3/4  Spinel                                                     8  Topaz                                                      8  Chrysoberyl                                                8-1/2  The Corundum group embracing the Ruby, Sapphire, etc.      9  Diamond                                                   10    (See also list of stones, arranged in their respective colours, in  Chapter XII.)    The method of testing is very simple. A representative selection of the  above stones, each with a sharp edge, is kept for the purpose of  scratching and being scratched, and those usually set apart for tests in  the various groups, are as follows:--        1 Talc      2 Rock-salt, or Gypsum      3 Calcite      4 Fluorspar      5 Apatite      6 Felspar      7 Quartz      8 Topaz      9 Corundum      10 Diamond    The stone under examination may perhaps first be somewhat roughly  classified by its colour, cleavage, and general shape. One of these  standard stones is then gently rubbed across its surface and then others  of increasingly higher degrees, till no scratch is evident under a  magnifying glass. Thus if quartz ceases to scratch it, but a topaz will  do so, the degree of hardness must lie between 7 and 8. Then we reverse  the process: the stone is passed over the standard, and if both quartz  and topaz are scratched, then the stone is at least equal in hardness to  the topaz, and its classification becomes an easy matter.    Instead of stones, some experts use variously-tempered needles of  different qualities and compositions of iron and steel. For instance, a  finely-tempered ordinary steel needle will cut up to No. 6 stones; one  made of tool steel, up to 7; one of manganese steel, to 7-1/2; one made  of high-speed tool steel, to 8 and 8-1/2, and so on, according to  temper; so that from the scratch which can be made with the finger-nail  on mica, to the hardness of the diamond, which diamond alone will  scratch readily, the stones may be picked out, classified and tested,  with unerring accuracy.    It will thus be seen how impossible it is, even in this one of many  tests, for an expert to be deceived in the purchase of precious stones,  except through gross carelessness--a fault seldom, if ever, met with in  the trade. For example--a piece of rock-crystal, chemically coloured,  and cut to represent a ruby, might appear so like one as to deceive a  novice, but the mere application to its surface of a real ruby, which is  hardness 9, or a No. 9 needle, would reveal too deep or powdery a  scratch; also its possibility of being scratched by a topaz or a No. 8  needle, would alone prove it false, for the corundum group, being harder  than No. 8, could not be scratched by it. So would the expert go down  the scale, the tiny scratches becoming fainter as he descended, because  he would be approaching more nearly the hardness of the stone under  test, till he arrived at the felspar, No. 6, which would be too soft to  scratch it, yet the stone would scratch the felspar, but not zircon or  andalusite, 7-1/2, or topaz, 8, so that his tests would at once classify  the stone as a piece of cut and coloured quartz, thus confirming what he  would, at the first sight, have suspected it to be.    The standard stones themselves are much more certain in results than the  needles, which latter, though well selected and tempered, are not  altogether reliable, especially in the more delicate distinctions of  picking out the hardest of certain stones of the same kind, in which  cases only the expert judge can decide with exactness. Accurate in this  the expert always is, for he judges by the sound and depth of his cut,  and by the amount and quality of the powder, often calling the  microscope to his aid, so that when the decision is made finally, there  is never the least doubt about it.    Rapidly as these tests can be made, they are extremely reliable, and  should the stone be of great value, it is also subjected to other  unerring tests of extreme severity, any one of which would prove it  false, if it chanced to be so, though some stones are manufactured and  coloured so cleverly that to all but the expert judge and experienced  dealer, they would pass well for the genuine.    In Mohs's list it will be seen that several stones vary considerably,  the opal, for instance, having a degree of hardness from 5-1/2 to 6-1/2  inclusive. All stones differ slightly, though almost all may be said to  fit their position in the scale; but in the case of the opal, the  difference shown is partly due to the many varieties of the stone, as  described in the last chapter.    In applying this test of hardness to a cut gem, it will be noticed that  some parts of the same stone seem to scratch more readily than others,  such as on a facet at the side, which is often softer than those nearest  the widest part of the stone, where the claws, which hold it in its  setting, usually come. This portion is called the \"girdle,\" and it is on  these \"girdle\" facets that the scratches are generally made. This  variation in hardness is mostly caused by cleavage, these cleavage  planes showing a marked, though often but slight, difference in the  scratch, which difference is _felt_ rather than seen. In addition to the  peculiar _feel_ of a cutting scratch, is the _sound_ of it. On a soft  stone being cut by a hard one, little or no sound is heard, but there  will form a plentiful supply of powder, which, on being brushed off,  reveals a more or less deep incision. But as the stones approach one  another in hardness, there will be little powder and a considerable  increase in the noise; for the harder are the stones, cutting and being  cut, the louder will be the sound and the less the powder. An example  of this difference is evident in the cutting of ordinary glass with a  \"set\" or \"glazier's\" diamond, and with a nail. If the diamond is held  properly, there will be heard a curious sound like a keen, drawn-out  \"kiss,\" the diamond being considerably harder than the material it cut.  An altogether different sound is that produced by the scratching of  glass with a"]]]
