Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:34) saw a single Ground  Dove fly across the Rio Grande into Coahuila at Lajitas, Texas, on May  10. Findley saw one 2 mi. S and 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas on June 22,  1952.    **_Scardafella inca_ (Lesson).--The Inca Dove has been recorded from  two localities in Coahuila. Hellmayr and Conover (1942:510) listed it  from Sabinas. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:189) collected a male and  female on April 16 and 19, respectively, \"outside the city limits of  Saltillo.\"    _Leptotila verreauxi angelica_ Bangs and Penard.--_Specimens examined:_  total 2: [Male] [Male] 31026-31027 (skeletons only) from 4 mi. W  Hacienda La Mariposa, 2300 ft., March 25, 1952.    The White-fronted Dove seems to be uncommon in Coahuila. Hellmayr and  Conover (1942:570) listed _L. v. angelica_ from Sabinas.    **_Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha terrisi_ Moore.--_Specimens examined:_  total 4: [Male] [Male] 31531-31532 from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las  Alazanas, 9345 ft., April 10, 1954, weights, 391.5 and 467.5 gms.;  [Female] 31533 from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, 10,000 ft.,  April 10, 1954, weight, 466 gms.; and sex ? 31534 from Mesa de las  Tablas, June, 1951.    The Thick-billed Parrot occurs in the southeastern section of the  State, where it is fairly common. Moore (1947:27-28) described this  parrot as _Rhynchopsitta terrisi_: he thought it differed decidedly  from _Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha_. However, Hardy and Dickerman  (1955:305-306) decided that uniting the two forms as a single species  better expresses their relationship.    Burleigh and Lowery (1942:189) reported seeing a small flock of  Thick-billed Parrots on the summit of Diamante Pass. Dickerman, in his  field notes, wrote that at a place 13 mi. E San Antonio de las  Alazanas, 9345 feet, a large flock of about 300 birds was in a  spruce-fir-pine-aspen association.    *_Coccyzus americanus americanus_ (Linnaeus).--_Specimens examined:_  total 2: [Male] [Male] 32037-32038 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850  ft., June 19, 1952, measurements: wing, 141, 146 mm.; tail, 142, 149  mm.; tarsus, 27, 27 mm.; culmen, 25, 24 mm.    In Coahuila, the Yellow-billed Cuckoo seems to be uncommon. It occurs  in the northeastern section of the State, in the Gulf Coastal Plain  (Baker, 1956:128), and probably breeds there. One subspecies,  _americanus_, has been recorded from Coahuila.    According to Ridgway (1916:13-17) the difference between _C. a.  americanus_ and _C. a. occidentalis_ is size. His (_loc. cit._) average  measurements of males of _occidentalis_ are: wing, 149.6 mm.; tail,  147.1 mm.; tarsus, 26.7 mm.; and culmen, 27.7 mm. whereas average  measurements given by him of males of _americanus_ are: wing, 143.6  mm.; tail, 140.7 mm.; tarsus, 25.2 mm.; and culmen, 26.4 mm. Van Tyne  and Sutton (1937:35) question the value of maintaining the subspecies  _occidentalis_, because individuals of _americanus_ and _occidentalis_  are almost impossible to tell apart. Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1950:132) stated that _americanus_ occurs in eastern North America  whereas _occidentalis_ occurs in western North America. If the  subspecies _occidentalis_ exists, then Nos. 32037 and 32038 are, by  size, _americanus_ and No. 32038 is an intergrade between the two  subspecies (or a large individual of _americanus_).    The Yellow-billed Cuckoo was seen also by Findley 2 mi. S and 3 mi. E  San Juan de Sabinas on June 22, 1952, and by Dickerson at Torreon on  July 2, 1955. The sizes of the testes of the birds from 12 mi. N and 12  mi. W Jimenez (9, 10 mm. long) and the date (June 19) on which they  occurred there indicate that the birds possibly were breeding.    _Coccyzus erythropthalmus_ (Wilson).--Miller (1955a:163) reported a  migrant Black-billed Cuckoo taken in the maples and basswood near a  water hole in the bottom of Boquillas Canyon in the Sierra del Carmen,  5200 feet, on April 22. Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:132)  reported that this cuckoo is presumably a regular transient in Mexico,  but generally overlooked.    *_Geococcyx californianus_ (Lesson).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Female] 32049, from 8 mi. N, 2 mi. W Piedras Negras, June 18, 1952.    Miller (1955a:163) heard several Roadrunners calling at Boquillas  Canyon in the Sierra del Carmen, where he obtained two females.  Burleigh and Lowery (1942:190) stated that the species proved to be  \"unexpectedly scarce\" and was noted but once by them on April 22 when a  single bird was observed in \"the open desert west of Saltillo.\" Sutton  and Burleigh (1939a:30) noted that the Roadrunner was not common  anywhere in southern Coahuila; they obtained one female at San Pedro on  January 29. The size of the largest ovum (15 mm. in diameter) of No.  32040 indicates that this species breeds in Coahuila.    *_Crotophaga sulcirostris sulcirostris_ Swainson.--_Specimen examined:_  one, [Female] 32039, from 2 mi. S, 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas, June  22, 1952.    No. 32039, obtained by Harrison B. Tordoff in a cypress woods along the  shore of a lagoon, provides the first record of the Groove-billed Ani  in Coahuila. The size of its largest ovum (10 mm. in diameter) and the  date indicate breeding by this species in Coahuila.    **_Tyto alba pratincola_ (Bonaparte).--The Barn Owl seems to be  uncommon in Coahuila. To my knowledge, there are two records of the  Barn Owl in Coahuila. Ridgway (1914:607) recorded this owl at the \"head  of Las Vacas Creek.\" Miller (1955a:163) heard the Barn Owl at 5000 feet  in the oak belt on April 25 in the Sierra del Carmen.    *_Otus asio suttoni_ Moore.--_O. a. suttoni_ is found in the higher  country of the Sierra del Carmen and western Coahuila. Miller  (1955a:163) stated that Screech Owls were common in groves of oaks both  at 7000 feet and 5000 feet in the Sierra del Carmen, and remarked that  his series from the Sierra del Carmen matched well a series of  _suttoni_ from Chihuahua and Durango. Miller (1955a:163-164) also  stated that Marsh took an adult at Jardin del Sur on August 28 and said  that the specimen from the Sierra del Carmen referred to as  _cineraceus_ by Marsh and Stevenson (1938:286) agreed well with his  series of _suttoni_. _O. a. suttoni_ probably occurs no farther east  than the Sierra del Carmen.    **_Otus asio mccallii_ (Cassin).--_Specimens examined:_ total 2: [Male]  32041 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 20, 1952; and sex ? 31645  from La Gacha, 1600 ft., December 9, 1953.    Three subspecies of the Screech Owl, _Otus asio_, occur in northeastern  Mexico; two of these, _suttoni_ and _mccallii_, occur in Coahuila, the  latter in the eastern part. The third subspecies, _O. a. semplei_,  occurs still farther east, for example in the state of Nuevo Leon on  the Mesa del Chipinque 6 miles south of Monterrey (Sutton and Burleigh,  1939b:174).    Nos. 31645 and 32041 differ from _semplei_ in that the tops of their  heads do not appear to be solid blackish brown at a distance of four to  five feet and in that the dark streakings of their backs and scapulars  are not so heavy as in _semplei_. The mentioned specimens are brownish,  not more black and white throughout as in _suttoni_ nor are their toes  heavily feathered (see Moore, 1941:154).    Findley observed a Screech Owl 2 mi. S and 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas  on June 22, 1952. La Gacha would seem to represent the western extent  of _mccallii_ in Coahuila. _O. a. mccallii_ and _suttoni_ probably  intergrade along the eastern slope of the Sierra del Carmen. Tordoff  took No. 32041 near a tree that contained three young Screech Owls.    *_Otus flammeolus flammeolus_ (Kaup).--_Specimens examined:_ total 2:  [Male] 31600 from 20 mi. S Ocampo, 6000 ft., April 4, 1954; and [Male]  31581 from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, 9345 ft., April 9,  1954.    Miller (1955a:163) collected seven Flammulated Owls in the pines and  oaks at 7000 feet in Carboneras Canyon and said that these owls were  common there. Nos. 31600 and 31581 are suffused with cinnamoneous  pigmentation, but represent the grayish phase, as described by Ridgway  (1914:729). Van Hoose (1955:302) previously recorded Nos. 31600 and  31581 from Coahuila.    *_Bubo virginianus pallescens_ Stone.--_Specimens examined:_ total 2:  [Female] 32042 from 2 mi. S, 12 mi. E Nava, June 15, 1952;  measurements: wing, 367 mm.; tail, 233 mm.; culmen, 29 mm.; and [Male]  31677 from 1.5 mi. NE Las Margaritas, 3100 ft., May 31, 1954;  measurements: wing, 345 mm.; tail, 213 mm.; culmen, 26 mm.; testes, 8  mm. long.    Miller (1955a:164) took a male Great Horned Owl in the Sierra del  Carmen on April 22. Ridgway (1914:742) listed _B. v. pallescens_ from  Sabinas. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:30) obtained a female \"near San  Pedro\" on January 29. Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:143) recorded  _B. v. pallescens_ from Coahuila on February 24, May 26, and June 10.  The record of _B. v. mayensis_ from Las Delicias (Amadon and Phillips,  1947:578) has been reidentified by Webster and Orr (1958:141) as _B. v.  pallescens_. Dickerman saw a Great Horned Owl in the Sierra del Pino on  May 12,1954.    *_Glaucidium gnoma californicum_ Sclater.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 31582, from 20 mi. S Ocampo, 6500 ft., April 5, 1954, weight, 55  gms.    Concerning forms of Pygmy Owls, Miller (1955a:164) remarked that the  best distinguishing characters of _G. g. gnoma_ and _californicum_ are  tail length and wing length. The characters of No. 31582 (wing, 94 mm.;  tail, 69 mm.) are clearly those of _californicum_ and not those of  _gnoma_. Miller (_loc. cit._) remarked that he \"encountered at least  five different individuals, chiefly in the pine-oak at 7000 feet\" and  one in oaks and pinons at 5000 feet in Boquillas Canyon of the Sierra  del Carmen. The size of the testes (left, 9x5 mm.; right, 7x4 mm.) of  No. 31582 indicates good probability of breeding by the Pygmy Owl in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26113"],[0,"Handbook of Wool Knitting and Crochet (#7)"],[1," needle  as if purling, slip stitch off, pass thread through 2d stitch of back  needle as if knitting, leave stitch on. Repeat from * until all the  stitches are off the needle.      Muffler    [Illustration: Muffler]    Two and one-half skeins of knitting-yarn and one pair amber needles No.  5, or Red Cross needles No. 3 will be required. Cast on 50 stitches,  measuring 11 inches, and knit back and forth until the muffler is  sixty-eight inches in length.      Hot-Water-Bottle Cover    [Illustration: Hot-Water-Bottle Cover]    White knitting-cotton (medium weight); 1 pair Red Cross needles No. 1.    Cast on 56 stitches, knit 2, purl 2 and repeat until the work is 4  inches deep. Then knit back and forth plain for 9 1/2 inches more, or  until entire work measures 13 1/2 inches. Next decrease 2 stitches at  beginning and 2 stitches at end of each needle until there are sixteen  stitches left, and bind off. Make another piece in same manner and sew  together. Attach a 20-inch piece of tape to seam at one side of ribbing  to tie around neck of bottle.      Helmet Made in Two Parts    [Illustration: Helmet Made in Two Parts]    One hank of yarn (1/4 pound); 1 pair Red Cross Needles No. 2.    The helmet is made in two parts, which afterward are sewed together.    FRONT OF HELMET.--Cast on 48 stitches (11 inches), knit plain for 25  ribs (6 inches) and knit 2, purl 2 for 35 rows. On the next row the  opening for the face is made as follows: Knit 2, purl 2, knit 2, purl 2,  knit 2, knit and bind off loosely the next 28 stitches and purl 1, knit  2, purl 2, knit 2, purl 2. Run the stitches before the opening on a  spare needle and on the stitches at the other side of opening knit 2,  purl 2 for 12 rows. The last row will end at the opening, and at that  point cast on 28 stitches to offset those bound off. Begin at the face  opening of stitches on spare needle and knit 2, purl 2 for 12 rows. At  the end of the 12th row continue all across to the end of other needle,  when there should be 48 stitches on needle as at first. Knit 2, purl 2  for 24 rows.    TOP OF HELMET.--Knit 2, narrow (knitting 2 stitches together), knit 14,  narrow, knit 14, narrow, knit 12. Purl the entire next row. On the 3d  row knit 2, narrow, knit 13, narrow, knit 13, narrow, knit 11. Purl 4th  row. On the 5th row knit 2, narrow, knit 12, narrow, knit 12, narrow,  knit 10. Purl 6th row. Continue to narrow in the 3 places every plain  knitted row with 1 stitch less between narrowings until 9 stitches are  left.    BACK OF HELMET.--Work in same manner as for front but omit the face  opening. Sew the stitches of upper edges together with joining-stitch.  Sew up the side seams, leaving the plain knitting at shoulders open.      Thumbless Mitt or Wristlet    [Illustration: Thumbless Mitt or Wristlet]    The thumbless mitt or wristlet requires one half hank of knitting-yarn,  gray, with No. 2 Red Cross needles or No. 11 or No. 12 steel needles.  Nine stitches measure one inch. Cast on 48 stitches and knit 2, purl 2,  for 12 inches; bind off and sew up, leaving an opening for the thumb two  inches in length, three inches from one end. The ordinary wristlets or  pulse-warmers are knitted in the same way, 8 1/2 inches long, and sewed  up with no thumb-opening.    Wristlets made in one piece require one half hank of yarn, and 4 bone  needles No. 3, or steel needles No. 12. Cast on 52 stitches on 3  needles; 16-16-20. Knit 2, purl 2, for 8 inches. To make opening for  thumb, knit 2, purl 2 to end of \"Third\" needle, turn; knit and purl back  to end of \"First\" needle, always slipping first stitch, turn. Continue  knitting back and forth for 2 inches. From this point continue as at  first for 4 inches for the hand. Bind off loosely; buttonhole  thumb-opening.      Bed-Sock    [Illustration: Bed-sock]    One hank of yarn (1/4 pound) is required, with Red Cross needles No. 2  or steel needles No. 11 or 12.    Cast 48 stitches on three needles, 16 on each. Knit plain and loosely  for 20 inches. Decrease every other stitch by knitting two stitches  together until you have 12 stitches on each of two needles opposite each  other. Break off yarn and weave stitches together as per directions for  finishing one-piece helmet.          Child's Drawers-Leggings Knitted      [Illustration: Child's Drawers-Leggings, Knitted]    Materials required are six hanks of Germantown wool, a pair of bone  needles No. 4, and a pair of steel needles, No. 15.    Cast on 68 stitches.    1 to 16. Knit 2, purl 2; repeat. This is the double rib.    17. Knit 6 plain, turn; knit back on these 6 stitches, turn.    18. Knit 12, turn; knit back on these 12 stitches.    Continue working in this way, knitting 6 more stitches forward each row  and knitting back on the same, until you have 36 stitches on the needle.  Knit back on these 36 stitches, turn. This brings 6 ridges at one side  of the work. Now knit plain across the entire 68 stitches.    Continue knitting back and forth until you have 34 ridges (not counting  the 6 ridges at one side of work); in next row narrow once at each end  of row, and continue in this way, narrowing a stitch each end, until you  have 50 stitches remaining on the needle.    Do 12 rows of double rib (knit 2, purl 2), then begin the cable-twist of  ankle, thus:    1. Knit 7, purl 2, slip 3 stitches on a spare needle, knit 6, then knit  the 3 stitches from the spare needle, forming the twist, purl 2, knit  10, purl 2, slip 3 stitches on spare needle, knit 6, knit the 3 stitches  from spare needle, purl 2, knit 7, turn.    2. Knit 6, purl 1, knit 2, purl 9, knit 2, purl 1, knit 8, purl 1, knit  2, purl 9, knit 2, purl 1, knit 6, turn.    3. Knit 7, purl 2, knit 9, purl 2, knit 10, purl 2, knit 9, purl 2, knit  7.    Repeat last 2 rows, alternately, for 30 rows, making the twist, as  directed in 1st row, every 6th row.    For the instep: Count off or leave 29 stitches; knit back 8 stitches on  these 29, and on the 8 stitches work back and forth until you have 8  ridges. Pick up the stitches around edge of instep, and work back and  forth along the entire row for 4 ridges; bind off.    Make the other leg in the same way, sew up the seams and join the two by  the middle seam.    Around the top work a row of spaces, in which to run the drawstrings,  thus:    1. Fasten in, chain 5, * miss 2, a treble in next, chain 2; repeat  around, and join to 3d of 5 chain.    2. Miss 1 space, 4 trebles in next, miss 1 space, fasten in next;  repeat.    Crochet a cord of the wool and finish the ends with tassels.          A Knitted Hood for Miss Dolly      [Illustration: A Knitted Hood for Miss Dolly]    Using blue Saxony and medium steel needles, cast on 74 stitches; knit  plain back and forth until you have 10 single ribs, then bind off 6,  knit across to within 6 stitches of the end and bind off these. This is  for the front or turnover of the hood.    Next row, knit 1, * over, narrow, knit 1; repeat, forming holes in which  to run ribbon.    Now change to white yarn and knit across, adding 6 extra stitches  distributed along the front near the top in order to make the back a  trifle full, * knit 1 row, purl 1 row and knit 1 row for a triple rib;  repeat from * 16 times, always slipping the 1st stitch of each row to  give a good selvage.    Bind off 26 stitches on each end of the work; be sure that this is done  on the wrong side, and just before knitting the last row of last rib, as  the binding off finishes the rib and is essential in keeping all the  ribs the same.    Knit the crown on the 16 middle stitches, in the triple ribs described.  Widen twice each end of crown needle during 1st 2 ribs. Knit same number  of ribs as the front, narrowing once or twice each end of needle near  extreme end of crown.    Pick up the stitches for the neck around lower part of crown and fronts,  about 18 stitches on each of the latter and alternate loops on the  crown; knit across with blue, making a row of holes as on the front;  knit 6 or 7 single ribs, and sew neatly to the stitches bound off at  lower edge of front.    Sew the crown neatly to front, run ribbon in the spaces made for it and  tighten slightly, and finish with ties and bows of ribbon.    By adding extra stitches to the front, and making the crown  proportionately larger, these directions will be found to serve  admirably for baby's first hood, or as large a hood as wanted.          A Lesson in Crochet      The stitches and terms given herewith are such as are in general use,  and were taught the writer by an English teacher of crocheting, herself  a professional in the art. In some periodicals and books, the real  slip-stitch is omitted, and the single is called slip-stitch; the double  is called single, the treble is called double, the double treble is  called treble, and so on.    There are different ways of holding the crochet-needle and carrying the  thread, and many consider one way as good as another unless, as is  usually the case, one's own method is thought a little the best. The  following instructions were given by the English teacher in question,  and are those commonly accepted: Hold the needle in the right hand very  much as you hold a pen when writing, letting the handle extend between  the forefinger and thumb, which rest on and hold the needle. Hold  nothing but the latter in the right hand, not allowing the fingers of  that hand to so much as rest on the work. Hold work with thumb and  second finger of left hand, letting the thread pass over the forefinger,  slightly raised, or held up from the work, under the second, over the  third and under the little finger. These instructions are especially  good for using yarns, when it is desirable to keep the work as soft and  fluffy as possible.    [Illustration: Figure 1. The Chain-Stitch]    THE CHAIN. (Figure 1.)
