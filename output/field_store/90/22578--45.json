See now, I pitied thee in thy misfortune,    and I showed thee the treasure, thinking thou wouldst    take a little of it to pay for the funeral, but thou hast pillaged it    utterly.\"      The old man looked out of window--the goat's horns and    beard caught his eye--it was the Devil himself, no doubt of it.      \"Let's get rid of him, money and all,\" thinks the old man;    \"I've lived before now without money, and now I'll go on living    without it.\"      So he took the pot of gold, carried it outside, flung it on the    ground, and bolted indoors again as quickly as possible.      The pope seized the pot of money, and hastened home.    When he got back, \"Come,\" says he, \"the money is in our    hands now. Here, mother, put it well out of sight, and take a    sharp knife, cut the thread, and pull the goatskin off me before    anyone sees it.\"      She took a knife, and was beginning to cut the thread at the    seam, when forth flowed blood, and the pope began to howl:      \"Oh! it hurts, mother, it hurts! don't cut mother, don't    cut!\"      She began ripping the skin open in another place, but with    just the same result. The goatskin had united with his body all    round. And all that they tried, and all that they did, even to taking    the money back to the old man, was of no avail. The goatskin    remained clinging tight to the pope all the same. God evidently    did it to punish him for his great greediness.    A somewhat less heathenish story with regard to money is the  following, which may be taken as a specimen of the Skazkas which bear  the impress of the genuine reverence which the peasants feel for their  religion, whatever may be the feelings they entertain towards its  ministers. While alluding to this subject, by the way, it may be as  well to remark that no great reliance can be placed upon the evidence  contained in the folk-tales of any land, with respect to the relations  between its clergy and their flocks. The local parson of folk-lore is,  as a general rule, merely the innocent inheritor of the bad reputation  acquired by some ecclesiastic of another age and clime.        THE CROSS-SURETY.[35]      Once upon a time two merchants lived in a certain town just on    the verge of a stream. One of them was a Russian, the other a    Tartar; both were rich. But the Russian got so utterly ruined    by some business or other that he hadn't a single bit of property    left. Everything he had was confiscated or stolen. The Russian    merchant had nothing to turn to--he was left as poor as a    rat.[36] So he went to his friend the Tartar, and besought him to    lend him some money.      \"Get me a surety,\" says the Tartar.      \"But whom can I get for you, seeing that I haven't a soul    belonging to me? Stay, though! there's a surety for you, the    life-giving cross on the church!\"      \"Very good, my friend!\" says the Tartar. \"I'll trust your    cross. Your faith or ours, it's all one to me.\"      And he gave the Russian merchant fifty thousand roubles.    The Russian took the money, bade the Tartar farewell, and    went back to trade in divers places.      By the end of two years he had gained a hundred and fifty    thousand roubles by the fifty thousand he had borrowed. Now    he happened to be sailing one day along the Danube, going with    wares from one place to another, when all of a sudden a storm    arose, and was on the point of sinking the ship he was in. Then    the merchant remembered how he had borrowed money, and    given the life-giving cross as a surety, but had not paid his debt.    That was doubtless the cause of the storm arising! No sooner    had he said this to himself than the storm began to subside.    The merchant took a barrel, counted out fifty thousand roubles,    wrote the Tartar a note, placed it, together with the money, in    the barrel, and then flung the barrel into the water, saying to    himself: \"As I gave the cross as my surety to the Tartar, the    money will be certain to reach him.\"      The barrel straightway sank to the bottom; everyone supposed    the money was lost. But what happened? In the Tartar's    house there lived a Russian kitchen-maid. One day she    happened to go to the river for water, and when she got there    she saw a barrel floating along. So she went a little way into    the water and began trying to get hold of it. But it wasn't to be    done! When she made at the barrel, it retreated from her:    when she turned from the barrel to the shore, it floated after    her. She went on trying and trying for some time, then she    went home and told her master all that had happened. At first    he wouldn't believe her, but at last he determined to go to the    river and see for himself what sort of barrel it was that was    floating there. When he got there--sure enough there was the    barrel floating, and not far from the shore. The Tartar took off    his clothes and went into the water; before he had gone any    distance the barrel came floating up to him of its own accord.    He laid hold of it, carried it home, opened it, and looked inside.    There he saw a quantity of money, and on top of the money a    note. He took out the note and read it, and this is what was    said in it:--      \"Dear friend! I return to you the fifty thousand roubles for    which, when I borrowed them from you, I gave the life-giving    cross as a surety.\"      The Tartar read these words and was astounded at the power    of the life-giving cross. He counted the money over to see    whether the full sum was really there. It was there exactly.      Meanwhile, the Russian merchant, after trading some five    years, made a tolerable fortune. Well, he returned to his old    home, and, thinking that his barrel had been lost, he considered    it his first duty to settle with the Tartar. So he went to his    house and offered him the money he had borrowed. Then the    Tartar told him all that had happened and how he had found    the barrel in the river, with the money and the note inside it.    Then he showed him the note, saying:      \"Is that really your hand?\"      \"It certainly is,\" replied the other.      Every one was astounded at this wondrous manifestation,    and the Tartar said:      \"Then I've no more money to receive from you, brother;    take that back again.\"      The Russian merchant had a service performed as a thank-offering    to God, and next day the Tartar was baptized with all    his household. The Russian merchant was his godfather, and    the kitchen-maid his godmother. After that they both lived    long and happily, survived to a great age, and then died peacefully.[37]    There is one marked feature in the Russian peasant's character to  which the Skazkas frequently refer--his passion for drink. To him  strong liquor is a friend, a comforter, a solace amid the ills of  life. Intoxication is not so much an evil to be dreaded or remembered  with shame, as a joy to be fondly anticipated, or classed with the  happy memories of the past. By him drunkenness is regarded, like  sleep, as the friend of woe--and a friend whose services can be even  more readily commanded. On certain occasions he almost believes that  to get drunk is a duty he owes either to the Church, or to the memory  of the Dead; at times without the slightest apparent cause, he is  seized by a sudden and irresistible craving for ardent spirits, and he  commences a drinking-bout which lasts--with intervals of coma--for  days, or even weeks, after which he resumes his everyday life and his  usual sobriety as calmly as if no interruption had taken place. All  these ideas and habits of his find expression in his popular tales,  giving rise to incidents which are often singularly out of keeping  with the rest of the narrative in which they occur. In one of the many  variants,[38] for instance, of a widespread and well known story--that  of the three princesses who are rescued from captivity by a hero from  whom they are afterwards carried away, and who refuse to get married  until certain clothes or shoes or other things impossible for ordinary  workmen to make are supplied to them--an unfortunate shoemaker is told  that if he does not next day produce the necessary shoes (of perfect  fit, although no measure has been taken, and all set thick with  precious stones) he shall be hanged. Away he goes at once to a  _traktir_, or tavern, and sets to work to drown his grief in drink.  After awhile he begins to totter. \"Now then,\" he says, \"I'll take home  a bicker of spirits with me, and go to bed. And to-morrow morning, as  soon as they come to fetch me to be hanged, I'll toss off half the  bickerful. They may hang me then without my knowing anything about  it.\"[39]    In the story of the \"Purchased Wife,\" the Princess Anastasia, the  Beautiful, enables the youth Ivan, who ransoms her, to win a large sum  of money in the following manner. Having worked a piece of embroidery,  she tells him to take it to market. \"But if any one purchases it,\"  says she, \"don't take any money from him, but ask him to give you  liquor enough to make you drunk.\" Ivan obeys, and this is the result.  He drank till he was intoxicated, and when he left the kabak (or  pot-house) he tumbled into a muddy pool. A crowd collected and folks  looked at him and said scoffingly, \"Oh, the fair youth! now'd be the  time for him to go to church to get married!\"    \"Fair or foul!\" says he, \"if I bid her, Anastasia the Beautiful will  kiss the crown of my head.\"    \"Don't go bragging like that!\" says a rich merchant--\"why she wouldn't  even so much as look at you,\" and offers to stake all that he is worth  on the truth of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22381"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome (#7)"],[1,"of Dirce at the hands of Amphion and Zethus forms the  subject of the world-renowned marble group in the museum at Naples, known  by the name of the Farnese Bull.    In sculpture Amphion is always represented with a lyre; Zethus with a club.    LEDA, whose affections Zeus won under the form of a swan, was the daughter  of Thestius, king of AEtolia. Her twin-sons, Castor and (Polydeuces or)  Pollux,[15] were {34} renowned for their tender attachment to each other.  They were also famous for their physical accomplishments, Castor being the  most expert charioteer of his day, and Pollux the first of pugilists. Their  names appear both among the hunters of the Calydonian boar-hunt and the  heroes of the Argonautic expedition. The brothers became attached to the  daughters of Leucippus, prince of the Messenians, who had been betrothed by  their father to Idas and Lynceus, sons of Aphareus. Having persuaded  Leucippus to break his promise, the twins carried off the maidens as their  brides. Idas and Lynceus, naturally furious at this proceeding, challenged  the Dioscuri to mortal combat, in which Castor perished by the hand of  Idas, and Lynceus by that of Pollux. Zeus wished to confer the gift of  immortality upon Pollux, but he refused to accept it unless allowed to  share it with Castor. Zeus gave the desired permission, and the faithful  brothers were both allowed to live, but only on alternate days. The  Dioscuri received divine honours throughout Greece, and were worshipped  with special reverence at Sparta.    EUROPA was the beautiful daughter of Agenor, king of Phoenicia. She was one  day gathering flowers with her companions in a meadow near the sea-shore,  when Zeus, charmed with her great beauty, and wishing to win her love,  transformed himself into a beautiful white bull, and trotted quietly up to  the princess, so as not to alarm her. Surprised at the gentleness of the  animal, and admiring its beauty, as it lay placidly on the grass, she  caressed it, crowned it with flowers, and, at last, playfully seated  herself on its back. Hardly had she done so than the disguised god bounded  away with his lovely burden, and swam across the sea with her to the island  of Crete.    Europa was the mother of Minos, Aeacus, and Rhadamanthus. Minos, who became  king of Crete, was celebrated for his justice and moderation, and after  death he was created one of the judges of the lower world, which office he  held in conjunction with his brothers. {35}    CALLISTO, the daughter of Lycaon, king of Arcadia, was a huntress in the  train of Artemis, devoted to the pleasures of the chase, who had made a vow  never to marry; but Zeus, under the form of the huntress-goddess, succeeded  in obtaining her affections. Hera, being extremely jealous of her, changed  her into a bear, and caused Artemis (who failed to recognize her attendant  under this form) to hunt her in the chase, and put an end to her existence.  After her death she was placed by Zeus among the stars as a constellation,  under the name of Arctos, or the bear.    ALCMENE, the daughter of Electryon, king of Mycenae, was betrothed to her  cousin Amphytrion; but, during his absence on a perilous undertaking, Zeus  assumed his form, and obtained her affections. Heracles (whose  world-renowned exploits will be related among the legends) was the son of  Alcmene and Zeus.    SEMELE, a beautiful princess, the daughter of Cadmus, king of Phoenicia,  was greatly beloved by Zeus. Like the unfortunate Callisto, she was hated  by Hera with jealous malignity, and the haughty queen of heaven determined  to effect her destruction. Disguising herself, therefore, as Beroe,  Semele's faithful old nurse, she artfully persuaded her to insist upon Zeus  visiting her, as he appeared to Hera, in all his power and glory, well  knowing that this would cause her instant death. Semele, suspecting no  treachery, followed the advice of her supposed nurse; and the next time  Zeus came to her, she earnestly entreated him to grant the favour she was  about to ask. Zeus swore by the Styx (which was to the gods an irrevocable  oath) to accede to her request whatsoever it might be. Semele, therefore,  secure of gaining her petition, begged of Zeus to appear to her in all the  glory of his divine power and majesty. As he had sworn to grant whatever  she asked of him, he was compelled to comply with her wish; he therefore  revealed himself as the mighty lord of the universe, accompanied by thunder  and lightning, and she was instantly consumed in the flames. {36}    IO, daughter of Inachus, king of Argos, was a priestess of Hera. She was  very beautiful, and Zeus, who was much attached to her, transformed her  into a white cow, in order to defeat the jealous intrigues of Hera, who,  however, was not to be deceived. Aware of the stratagem, she contrived to  obtain the animal from Zeus, and placed her under the watchful care of a  man called Argus-Panoptes, who fastened her to an olive-tree in the grove  of Hera. He had a hundred eyes, of which, when asleep, he never closed more  than two at a time; being thus always on the watch, Hera found him  extremely useful in keeping guard over Io. Hermes, however, by the command  of Zeus, succeeded in putting all his eyes to sleep with the sound of his  magic lyre, and then, taking advantage of his helpless condition, slew him.  The story goes, that in commemoration of the services which Argus had  rendered her, Hera placed his eyes on the tail of a peacock, as a lasting  memorial of her gratitude. Ever fertile in resource, Hera now sent a gadfly  to worry and torment the unfortunate Io incessantly, and she wandered all  over the world in hopes of escaping from her tormentor. At length she  reached Egypt, where she found rest and freedom from the persecutions of  her enemy. On the banks of the Nile she resumed her original form and gave  birth to a son called Epaphus, who afterwards became king of Egypt, and  built the famous city of Memphis.    DANAE.--Zeus appeared to Danae under the form of a shower of gold. (Further  details concerning her will be found in the legend of Perseus.)           *       *       *       *       *    The Greeks supposed that the divine ruler of the Universe occasionally  assumed a human form, and descended from his celestial abode, in order to  visit mankind and observe their proceedings, his aim being generally either  to punish the guilty, or to reward the deserving.    On one occasion Zeus, accompanied by Hermes, made a journey through  Phrygia, seeking hospitality and shelter wherever they went. But nowhere  did they receive a {37} kindly welcome till they came to the humble cottage  of an old man and his wife called Philemon and Baucis, who entertained them  with the greatest kindness, setting before them what frugal fare their  humble means permitted, and bidding them welcome with unaffected  cordiality. Observing in the course of their simple repast that the wine  bowl was miraculously replenished, the aged couple became convinced of the  divine nature of their guests. The gods now informed them that on account  of its wickedness their native place was doomed to destruction, and told  them to climb the neighbouring hill with them, which overlooked the village  where they dwelt. What was their dismay on beholding at their feet, in  place of the spot where they had passed so many happy years together,  nothing but a watery plain, the only house to be seen being their own  little cottage, which suddenly changed itself into a temple before their  eyes. Zeus now asked the worthy pair to name any wish they particularly  desired and it should be granted. They accordingly begged that they might  serve the gods in the temple below, and end life together.    Their wish was granted, for, after spending the remainder of their lives in  the worship of the gods, they both died at the same instant, and were  transformed by Zeus into trees, remaining for ever side by side.    Upon another occasion Zeus, wishing to ascertain for himself the truth of  the reports concerning the atrocious wickedness of mankind, made a journey  through Arcadia. Being recognized by the Arcadians as king of heaven, he  was received by them with becoming respect and veneration; but Lycaon,  their king, who had rendered himself infamous by the gross impiety of  himself and his sons, doubted the divinity of Zeus, ridiculed his people  for being so easily duped, and, according to his custom of killing all  strangers who ventured to trust his hospitality, resolved to murder him.  Before executing this wicked design, however, he decided to put Zeus to the  test, and having killed a boy for the purpose, placed before him a dish  containing human flesh. But Zeus was {38} not to be deceived. He beheld the  revolting dish with horror and loathing, and angrily upsetting the table  upon which it was placed, turned Lycaon into a wolf, and destroyed all his  fifty sons by lightning, except Nyctimus, who was saved by the intervention  of Gaea.    JUPITER.    The Roman Jupiter, who is so frequently confounded with the Greek Zeus, is  identical with him only as being the head of the Olympic gods, and the  presiding deity over Life, Light, and Aerial Phenomena. Jupiter is lord of  life in its widest and most comprehensive signification, having absolute  power over life and death, in which respect he differed from the Greek  Zeus, who was to a certain extent controlled by the all-potent sway of the  Moirae or Fates. Zeus, as we have seen, often condescends to visit mankind,  either as a mortal, or under various disguises, whereas Jupiter always  remains essentially the supreme god of heaven, and never appears upon  earth.    The most celebrated temple of Jupiter was that on the Capitoline Hill in  the city of Rome, where he was worshipped under the names of  Jupiter-Optimus-Maximus, Capitolinus, and Tarpeius.    The Romans represented him seated on a throne of ivory,"]]]
