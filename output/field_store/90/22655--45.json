Thus,  double is a relative term, for that which is double is explained as the  double of something. Knowledge, again, is the opposite of the thing  known, in the same sense; and the thing known also is explained by its  relation to its opposite, knowledge. For the thing known is explained  as that which is known by something, that is, by knowledge. Such  things, then, as are opposite the one to the other in the sense of  being correlatives are explained by a reference of the one to the other.    (ii) Pairs of opposites which are contraries are not in any way  interdependent, but are contrary the one to the other. The good is not  spoken of as the good of the bad, but as the contrary of the bad, nor  is white spoken of as the white of the black, but as the contrary of  the black. These two types of opposition are therefore distinct. Those  contraries which are such that the subjects in which they are naturally  present, or of which they are predicated, must necessarily contain  either the one or the other of them, have no intermediate, but those in  the case of which no such necessity obtains, always have an  intermediate. Thus disease and health are naturally present in the body  of an animal, and it is necessary that either the one or the other  should be present in the body of an animal. Odd and even, again, are  predicated of number, and it is necessary that the one or the other  should be present in numbers. Now there is no intermediate between the  terms of either of these two pairs. On the other hand, in those  contraries with regard to which no such necessity obtains, we find an  intermediate. Blackness and whiteness are naturally present in the  body, but it is not necessary that either the one or the other should  be present in the body, inasmuch as it is not true to say that  everybody must be white or black. Badness and goodness, again, are  predicated of man, and of many other things, but it is not necessary  that either the one quality or the other should be present in that of  which they are predicated: it is not true to say that everything that  may be good or bad must be either good or bad. These pairs of  contraries have intermediates: the intermediates between white and  black are grey, sallow, and all the other colours that come between;  the intermediate between good and bad is that which is neither the one  nor the other.    Some intermediate qualities have names, such as grey and sallow and all  the other colours that come between white and black; in other cases,  however, it is not easy to name the intermediate, but we must define it  as that which is not either extreme, as in the case of that which is  neither good nor bad, neither just nor unjust.    (iii) 'privatives' and 'positives' have reference to the same subject.  Thus, sight and blindness have reference to the eye. It is a universal  rule that each of a pair of opposites of this type has reference to  that to which the particular 'positive' is natural. We say that that is  capable of some particular faculty or possession has suffered privation  when the faculty or possession in question is in no way present in that  in which, and at the time at which, it should naturally be present. We  do not call that toothless which has not teeth, or that blind which has  not sight, but rather that which has not teeth or sight at the time  when by nature it should. For there are some creatures which from birth  are without sight, or without teeth, but these are not called toothless  or blind.    To be without some faculty or to possess it is not the same as the  corresponding 'privative' or 'positive'. 'Sight' is a 'positive',  'blindness' a 'privative', but 'to possess sight' is not equivalent to  'sight', 'to be blind' is not equivalent to 'blindness'. Blindness is a  'privative', to be blind is to be in a state of privation, but is not a  'privative'. Moreover, if 'blindness' were equivalent to 'being blind',  both would be predicated of the same subject; but though a man is said  to be blind, he is by no means said to be blindness.    To be in a state of 'possession' is, it appears, the opposite of being  in a state of 'privation', just as 'positives' and 'privatives'  themselves are opposite. There is the same type of antithesis in both  cases; for just as blindness is opposed to sight, so is being blind  opposed to having sight.    That which is affirmed or denied is not itself affirmation or denial.  By 'affirmation' we mean an affirmative proposition, by 'denial' a  negative. Now, those facts which form the matter of the affirmation or  denial are not propositions; yet these two are said to be opposed in  the same sense as the affirmation and denial, for in this case also the  type of antithesis is the same. For as the affirmation is opposed to  the denial, as in the two propositions 'he sits', 'he does not sit', so  also the fact which constitutes the matter of the proposition in one  case is opposed to that in the other, his sitting, that is to say, to  his not sitting.    It is evident that 'positives' and 'privatives' are not opposed each to  each in the same sense as relatives. The one is not explained by  reference to the other; sight is not sight of blindness, nor is any  other preposition used to indicate the relation. Similarly blindness is  not said to be blindness of sight, but rather, privation of sight.  Relatives, moreover, reciprocate; if blindness, therefore, were a  relative, there would be a reciprocity of relation between it and that  with which it was correlative. But this is not the case. Sight is not  called the sight of blindness.    That those terms which fall under the heads of 'positives' and  'privatives' are not opposed each to each as contraries, either, is  plain from the following facts: Of a pair of contraries such that they  have no intermediate, one or the other must needs be present in the  subject in which they naturally subsist, or of which they are  predicated; for it is those, as we proved, in the case of which this  necessity obtains, that have no intermediate. Moreover, we cited health  and disease, odd and even, as instances. But those contraries which  have an intermediate are not subject to any such necessity. It is not  necessary that every substance, receptive of such qualities, should be  either black or white, cold or hot, for something intermediate between  these contraries may very well be present in the subject. We proved,  moreover, that those contraries have an intermediate in the case of  which the said necessity does not obtain. Yet when one of the two  contraries is a constitutive property of the subject, as it is a  constitutive property of fire to be hot, of snow to be white, it is  necessary determinately that one of the two contraries, not one or the  other, should be present in the subject; for fire cannot be cold, or  snow black. Thus, it is not the case here that one of the two must  needs be present in every subject receptive of these qualities, but  only in that subject of which the one forms a constitutive property.  Moreover, in such cases it is one member of the pair determinately, and  not either the one or the other, which must be present.    In the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', on the other hand, neither  of the aforesaid statements holds good. For it is not necessary that a  subject receptive of the qualities should always have either the one or  the other; that which has not yet advanced to the state when sight is  natural is not said either to be blind or to see. Thus 'positives' and  'privatives' do not belong to that class of contraries which consists  of those which have no intermediate. On the other hand, they do not  belong either to that class which consists of contraries which have an  intermediate. For under certain conditions it is necessary that either  the one or the other should form part of the constitution of every  appropriate subject. For when a thing has reached the stage when it is  by nature capable of sight, it will be said either to see or to be  blind, and that in an indeterminate sense, signifying that the capacity  may be either present or absent; for it is not necessary either that it  should see or that it should be blind, but that it should be either in  the one state or in the other. Yet in the case of those contraries  which have an intermediate we found that it was never necessary that  either the one or the other should be present in every appropriate  subject, but only that in certain subjects one of the pair should be  present, and that in a determinate sense. It is, therefore, plain that  'positives' and 'privatives' are not opposed each to each in either of  the senses in which contraries are opposed.    Again, in the case of contraries, it is possible that there should be  changes from either into the other, while the subject retains its  identity, unless indeed one of the contraries is a constitutive  property of that subject, as heat is of fire. For it is possible that  that that which is healthy should become diseased, that which is white,  black, that which is cold, hot, that which is good, bad, that which is  bad, good. The bad man, if he is being brought into a better way of  life and thought, may make some advance, however slight, and if he  should once improve, even ever so little, it is plain that he might  change completely, or at any rate make very great progress; for a man  becomes more and more easily moved to virtue, however small the  improvement was at first. It is, therefore, natural to suppose that he  will make yet greater progress than he has made in the past; and as  this process goes on, it will change him completely and establish him  in the contrary state, provided he is not hindered by lack of time. In  the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', however, change in both  directions is impossible. There may be a change from possession to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],[0,"Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#7)"],[1,"till the nine o'clock bell rings them home to their respective       habitations.\"    This simple and quaint picture of youthful love in the soft summer  twilight, at that ever beautiful trysting-place, gives an unwonted touch  of sentiment to the austere daily life of colonial New England. The  omnipotent Puritan law-giver, who meddled and interfered in every  detail, small and great, of the public and private life of the citizen,  could not leave untouched, in fancy free, these soberly promenading  Puritan sweethearts. A Boston gallant must choose well his  marmalet-madam, must proceed cautiously in his love-making in the  gloaming, obtaining first the formal permission of parents or guardians  ere he take any step in courtship. Fines, imprisonment, or the  whipping-post awaited him, did he \"inveigle the affections of any maide  or maide servant\" by making love to her without proper authority.  Numberless examples might be given to prove that this law was no dead  letter. In 1647, in Stratford, Will Colefoxe was fined L5 for \"laboring  to invegle the affection of Write his daughter.\" In 1672 Jonathan  Coventry, of Plymouth town, was indicted for \"making a motion of  marriage\" to Katharine Dudley without obtaining formal consent. The  sensible reason for these courtship regulations was \"to prevent young  folk from intangling themselves by rash and inconsiderate contracts of  maridge.\" The Governor of Plymouth colony, Thomas Prence, did not  hesitate to drag his daughter's love affairs before the public, in 1660,  by prosecuting Arthur Howland for \"disorderly and unrighteously  endeavouring to gain the affections of Mistress Elizabeth Prence.\" The  unrighteous lover was fined L5. Seven years later, patient Arthur, who  would not \"refrain and desist,\" was again fined the same amount; but  love prevailed over law, and he triumphantly married his fair Elizabeth  a few months later. The marriage of a daughter with an unwelcome swain  was also often prohibited by will, \"not to suffer her to be circumvented  and cast away upon a swaggering gentleman.\"    On the other hand, an engagement of marriage once having been permitted,  the father could not recklessly or unreasonably interfere to break off  the contract. Many court records prove that colonial lovers promptly  resented by legal action any attempt of parents to bring to an end a  sanctioned love affair. Richard Taylor so sued, and for such cause, Ruth  Whieldon's father in Plymouth in 1661; while another ungallant swain is  said to have sued the maid's father for the loss of time spent in  courting. Breach of promise cases were brought against women by  disappointed men who had been \"shabbed\" (as jilting was called in some  parts of New England), as well as by deserted women against men.    But sly Puritan maids found a way to circumvent and outwit Puritan law  makers, and to prevent their unsanctioned lovers from being punished,  too. Hear the craft of Sarah Tuttle. On May day in New Haven, in 1660,  she went to the house of a neighbor, Dame Murline, to get some thread.  Some very loud jokes were exchanged between Sarah and her friends Maria  and Susan Murline--so loud, in fact, that Dame Murline testified in  court that it \"much distressed her and put her in a sore strait.\" In the  midst of all this doubtful fun Jacob Murline entered, and seizing  Sarah's gloves, demanded the centuries old forfeit of a kiss.  \"Wherupon,\" writes the scandalized Puritan chronicler, \"they sat down  together; his arm being about her; and her arm upon his shoulder or  about his neck; and hee kissed her, and shee kissed him, or they kissed  one another, continuing in this posture about half an hour, as Maria and  Susan testified.\" Goodman Tuttle, who was a man of dignity and  importance, angrily brought suit against Jacob for inveigling his  daughter's affections; \"but Sarah being asked in court if Jacob  inveagled her, said No.\" This of course prevented any rendering of  judgment against the unauthorized kissing by Jacob, and he escaped the  severe punishment of his offence. But the outraged and baffled court  fined Sarah, and gave her a severe lecture, calling her with justice a  \"Bould Virgin.\" She at the end, demurely and piously answered that \"She  hoped God would help her to carry it Better for time to come.\" And  doubtless she did carry it better; for at the end of two years, this  bold virgin's fine for unruly behavior being still unpaid, half of it  was remitted.    Of the etiquette, the pleasures, the exigencies of colonial \"courtship  in high life,\" let one of the actors speak for himself through the pages  of his diary. Judge Sewall's first wife was Hannah Hull, the only  daughter of Captain Hull of Pine Tree Shilling fame. She received as her  dowry her weight in silver shillings. Of her wooing we know naught save  the charming imaginary story told us by Hawthorne. The Judge's only  record is this:         \"Mrs. Hannah Hull saw me when I took my Degree and set her       affection on me though I knew nothing of it till after our       Marriage.\"    She lived with him forty-three years, bore him seven sons and seven  daughters, and died on the 19th day of October, 1717.    Of course, though the Judge was sixty-six years old, he would marry  again. Like a true Puritan he despised an unmarried life, and on the 6th  day of February he made this naive entry in his diary: \"Wandering in my  mind whether to live a Married or a Single Life.\" Ere that date he had  begun to take notice. He had called more than once on Widow Ruggles, and  had had Widow Gill to dine with him; had looked critically at Widow  Emery, and noted that Widow Tilley was absent from meeting; and he had  gazed admiringly at Widow Winthrop in \"her sley,\" and he had visited  and counseled and consoled her ere his wife had been two months dead,  and had given her a few suitable tokens of his awakening affection such  as \"Smoking Flax Inflamed,\" \"The Jewish Children of Berlin,\" and \"My  Small Vial of Tears;\" so he had \"wandered\" in the flesh as well as in  the mind.    Such an array of widows! Boston fairly blossomed with widows, the widows  of all the \"true New England men\" whose wills Sewall had drawn up, whose  dying bedsides he had blessed and harassed with his prayers, whose  bodies he had borne to the grave, whose funeral gloves and scarves and  rings he had received and apprized, and whose estates he had settled.  Over this sombre flower-bed of black garbed widows, these hardy  perennials, did this aged Puritan butterfly amorously hover, loth to  settle, tasting each solemn sweet, calculating the richness of the soil  in which each was planted, gauging the golden promise of fruit, and  perhaps longing for the whole garden of full-blown blossoms. \"Antient  maides\" were held in little esteem by him; not one thornback is on his  list.    Not only did he look and wander, but all his friends and neighbors arose  and began to suggest and search for a suitable wife for him, with as  officious alacrity as if he needed help, which he certainly did not. In  March Madam Henchman strongly recommended to him \"Madam Winthrop, the  Major General's widow.\" This recommendation was very sweet to the  widower, who had turned his eyes with such special approval on this  special widow, and further and warm encouragement came quickly.         \"Deacon Marion comes to me, sits with me a great while in the       evening; after a great deal of Discourse about his Courtship He       told me the Olivers said they wish'd I would court their Aunt. I       said little, but said 'twas not five Moneths since I buried my dear       Wife. Had said before 'twas hard to know whether to marry again or       no or whom to marry.\"    The Olivers' aunt was Madam Winthrop. It would seem somewhat  presumptuous and officious for nieces and nephews to suggest courtship,  when there were grown up Winthrop children who might dislike the  marriage, but in those days everyone meddled in love affairs; to quote  Pope: \"Marriage was the theme on which they all declaimed.\" The Judge  gossiped publicly about his intentions. He writes: \"They had laid one  out for me, and Governor Dudley told me 'twas Madam Winthrop. I told him  I had been there but thrice and twice upon business. He said _cave  tertium_.\" Even solemn Cotton Mather proffered counsel in a letter on  \"paying regards to the Widow.\"    In spite of all these hints and commendations, and the Judge's evident  pleasure in receiving them, the Winthrop agitation all came to naught,  for about this time he was called to make a will for a Mr. Denison, of  Roxbury, who died on March 22d. Though the Judge was too upright and too  pious to let even his thoughts wander to a wife, the amazing rapidity  with which he turned his longing eyes on the newly-made widow (cruelly  forsaking Madam Winthrop) is only equalled by the act of the famous  Irish lover who proposed to a widow at the open grave of her husband.    Judge Sewall went home with widow Denison from her husband's funeral and  \"prayed God to keep house with her.\" The very next day he writes, \"Mr.  Danforth gives the Widow Denison a high commendation for her Piety,  Goodness, Diligence and Humility.\" On April 7th she came to the widower  to prove her husband's will; and another match-making friend, Mr. Dow,  \"took occasion to say in her absence that she was one of the most  Dutiful Wives in the World.\" A few days later the Judge made her a gift,  \"a Widow's book having writ her name in it.\"    At last, after talking the matter over with all his friends, he decided  positively to go a-courting. Widow Denison came to his house and he  says:         \"I took her up into my chamber and discoursed Thorowly with her:       told her I intended to visit her next Lecture Day. She said 'twould       be talk'd of, I answered: In such Cases persons must run the       Gantlet. Gave her an Oration.\"    He visited her as he had promised and gave her \"Dr."]]]
