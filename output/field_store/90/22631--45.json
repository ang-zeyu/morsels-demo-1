[Footnote 10: The sketch was made about ten o'clock on a September  morning.]    [Illustration: PLATE VII. (Fig. 11., Fig. 12.)]    22. Nor is the spire the only ecclesiastical form deducible from  domestic architecture. The spires of France and Germany are associated  with other towers, even simpler and more straightforward in confession  of their nature, in which, though the walls of the tower are covered  with sculpture, there is an ordinary ridged gable roof on the top. The  finest example I know of this kind of tower, is that on the north-west  angle of Rouen Cathedral (_fig._ 12); but they occur in multitudes in  the older towns of Germany; and the backgrounds of Albert Duerer are full  of them, and owe to them a great part of their interest: all these great  and magnificent masses of architecture being repeated on a smaller scale  by the little turret roofs and pinnacles of every house in the town; and  the whole system of them being expressive, not by any means of religious  feeling,[11] but merely of joyfulness and exhilaration of spirit in the  inhabitants of such cities, leading them to throw their roofs high into  the sky, and therefore giving to the style of architecture with which  these grotesque roofs are associated, a certain charm like that of  cheerfulness in a human face; besides a power of interesting the  beholder which is testified, not only by the artist in his constant  search after such forms as the elements of his landscape, but by every  phrase of our language and literature bearing on such topics. Have not  these words, Pinnacle, Turret, Belfry, Spire, Tower, a pleasant sound in  all your ears? I do not speak of your scenery, I do not ask you how much  you feel that it owes to the gray battlements that frown through the  woods of Craigmillar, to the pointed turrets that flank the front of  Holyrood, or to the massy keeps of your Crichtoun and Borthwick and  other border towers. But look merely through your poetry and romances;  take away out of your border ballads the word _tower_ wherever it  occurs, and the ideas connected with it, and what will become of the  ballads? See how Sir Walter Scott cannot even get through a description  of Highland scenery without help from the idea:--        \"Each purple peak, each flinty _spire_,      Was bathed in floods of living fire.\"    Take away from Scott's romances the word and idea _turret_, and see how  much you would lose. Suppose, for instance, when young Osbaldistone is  leaving Osbaldistone Hall, instead of saying \"The old clock struck two  from a _turret_ adjoining my bedchamber,\" he had said, \"The old clock  struck two from the landing at the top of the stair,\" what would become  of the passage? And can you really suppose that what has so much power  over you in words has no power over you in reality? Do you think there  is any group of words which would thus interest you, when the things  expressed by them are uninteresting?    [Footnote 11: Among the various modes in which the architects, against  whose practice my writings are directed, have endeavored to oppose them,  no charge has been made more frequently than that of their  self-contradiction; the fact being, that there are few people in the  world who are capable of seeing the two sides of any subject, or of  conceiving how the statements of its opposite aspects can possibly be  reconcilable. For instance, in a recent review, though for the most part  both fair and intelligent, it is remarked, on this very subject of the  domestic origin of the northern Gothic, that \"Mr. Ruskin is evidently  possessed by a fixed idea, that the Venetian architects were devout men,  and that their devotion was expressed in their buildings; while he will  not allow our own cathedrals to have been built by any but worldly men,  who had no thoughts of heaven, but only vague ideas of keeping out of  hell, by erecting costly places of worship.\" If this writer had compared  the two passages with the care which such a subject necessarily demands,  he would have found that I was not opposing Venetian to English piety;  but that in the one case I was speaking of the spirit manifested in the  entire architecture of the nation, and in the other of occasional  efforts of superstition as distinguished from that spirit; and, farther,  that in the one case, I was speaking of decorative features, which are  ordinarily the results of feelings, in the other of structural features,  which are ordinarily the results of necessity or convenience. Thus it is  rational and just that we should attribute the decoration of the arches  of St. Mark's with scriptural mosaics to a religious sentiment; but it  would be a strange absurdity to regard as an effort of piety the  invention of the form of the arch itself, of which one of the earliest  and most perfect instances is in the Cloaca Maxima. And thus in the case  of spires and towers, it is just to ascribe to the devotion of their  designers that dignity which was bestowed upon forms derived from the  simplest domestic buildings; but it is ridiculous to attribute any great  refinement of religious feeling, or height of religious aspiration, to  those who furnished the funds for the erection of the loveliest tower in  North France, by paying for permission to eat butter in Lent.]    23. For instance, you know that, for an immense time back, all your  public buildings have been built with a row of pillars supporting a  triangular thing called a pediment. You see this form every day in your  banks and clubhouses, and churches and chapels; you are told that it is  the perfection of architectural beauty; and yet suppose Sir Walter  Scott, instead of writing, \"Each purple peak, each flinty spire,\" had  written, \"Each purple peak, each flinty 'pediment.'\"[12] Would you have  thought the poem improved? And if not, why would it be spoiled? Simply  because the idea is no longer of any value to you; the thing spoken of  is a nonentity. These pediments, and stylobates, and architraves never  excited a single pleasurable feeling in you--never will, to the end of  time. They are evermore dead, lifeless, and useless, in art as in  poetry, and though you built as many of them as there are slates on your  house-roofs, you will never care for them. They will only remain to  later ages as monuments of the patience and pliability with which the  people of the nineteenth century sacrificed their feelings to fashions,  and their intellects to forms. But on the other hand, that strange and  thrilling interest with which such words strike you as are in any wise  connected with Gothic architecture--as for instance, Vault, Arch, Spire,  Pinnacle, Battlement, Barbican, Porch, and myriads of such others, words  everlastingly poetical and powerful whenever they occur,--is a most true  and certain index that the things themselves are delightful to you, and  will ever continue to be so. Believe me, you do indeed love these  things, so far as you care about art at all, so far as you are not  ashamed to confess what you feel about them.    [Footnote 12: It has been objected to this comparison that the form of  the pediment does not properly represent that of the rocks of the  Trossachs. The objection is utterly futile, for there is not a single  spire or pinnacle from one end of the Trossachs to the other. All their  rocks are heavily rounded, and the introduction of the word \"spire\" is a  piece of inaccuracy in description, ventured _merely for the sake of the  Gothic image_. Farther: it has been said that if I had substituted the  word \"gable,\" it would have spoiled the line just as much as the word  \"pediment,\" though \"gable\" is a Gothic word. Of course it would; but  why? Because \"gable\" is a term of vulgar domestic architecture, and  therefore destructive of the tone of the heroic description; whereas  \"pediment\" and \"spire\" are precisely correlative terms, being each the  crowning feature in ecclesiastical edifices, and the comparison of their  effects in the verse is therefore absolutely accurate, logical, and  just.]    24. In your public capacities, as bank directors, and charity overseers,  and administrators of this and that other undertaking or institution,  you cannot express your feelings at all. You form committees to decide  upon the style of the new building, and as you have never been in the  habit of trusting to your own taste in such matters, you inquire who is  the most celebrated, that is to say, the most employed, architect of the  day. And you send for the great Mr. Blank, and the Great Blank sends you  a plan of a great long marble box with half-a-dozen pillars at one end  of it, and the same at the other; and you look at the Great Blank's  great plan in a grave manner, and you dare say it will be very handsome;  and you ask the Great Blank what sort of a blank check must be filled up  before the great plan can be realized; and you subscribe in a generous  \"burst of confidence\" whatever is wanted; and when it is all done, and  the great white marble box is set up in your streets, you contemplate  it, not knowing what to make of it exactly, but hoping it is all right;  and then there is a dinner given to the Great Blank, and the morning  papers say that the new and handsome building, erected by the great Mr.  Blank, is one of Mr. Blank's happiest efforts, and reflects the greatest  credit upon the intelligent inhabitants of the city of so-and-so; and  the building keeps the rain out as well as another, and you remain in a  placid state of impoverished satisfaction therewith; but as for having  any real pleasure out of it, you never hoped for such a thing.

He is always a little blind after he has changed his skin, and  very quick to strike.\"    Kaa was not a poison snake--in fact he rather despised the poison snakes  as cowards--but his strength lay in his hug, and when he had once  lapped his huge coils round anybody there was no more to be said. \"Good  hunting!\" cried Baloo, sitting up on his haunches. Like all snakes of  his breed Kaa was rather deaf, and did not hear the call at first. Then  he curled up ready for any accident, his head lowered.    \"Good hunting for us all,\" he answered. \"Oho, Baloo, what dost thou do  here? Good hunting, Bagheera. One of us at least needs food. Is there  any news of game afoot? A doe now, or even a young buck? I am as empty  as a dried well.\"    \"We are hunting,\" said Baloo carelessly. He knew that you must not hurry  Kaa. He is too big.    \"Give me permission to come with you,\" said Kaa. \"A blow more or less is  nothing to thee, Bagheera or Baloo, but I--I have to wait and wait for  days in a wood-path and climb half a night on the mere chance of a  young ape. Psshaw! The branches are not what they were when I was young.  Rotten twigs and dry boughs are they all.\"    \"Maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter,\" said  Baloo.    \"I am a fair length--a fair length,\" said Kaa with a little pride. \"But  for all that, it is the fault of this new-grown timber. I came very  near to falling on my last hunt--very near indeed--and the noise of my  slipping, for my tail was not tight wrapped around the tree, waked the  Bandar-log, and they called me most evil names.\"    \"Footless, yellow earth-worm,\" said Bagheera under his whiskers, as  though he were trying to remember something.    \"Sssss! Have they ever called me that?\" said Kaa.    \"Something of that kind it was that they shouted to us last moon, but we  never noticed them. They will say anything--even that thou hast lost all  thy teeth, and wilt not face anything bigger than a kid, because (they  are indeed shameless, these Bandar-log)--because thou art afraid of the  he-goat's horns,\" Bagheera went on sweetly.    Now a snake, especially a wary old python like Kaa, very seldom shows  that he is angry, but Baloo and Bagheera could see the big swallowing  muscles on either side of Kaa's throat ripple and bulge.    \"The Bandar-log have shifted their grounds,\" he said quietly. \"When I  came up into the sun today I heard them whooping among the tree-tops.\"    \"It--it is the Bandar-log that we follow now,\" said Baloo, but the words  stuck in his throat, for that was the first time in his memory that one  of the Jungle-People had owned to being interested in the doings of the  monkeys.    \"Beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such  hunters--leaders in their own jungle I am certain--on the trail of the  Bandar-log,\" Kaa replied courteously, as he swelled with curiosity.    \"Indeed,\" Baloo began, \"I am no more than the old and sometimes very  foolish Teacher of the Law to the Seeonee wolf-cubs, and Bagheera  here--\"    \"Is Bagheera,\" said the Black Panther, and his jaws shut with a snap,  for he did not believe in being humble. \"The trouble is this, Kaa. Those  nut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our man-cub of  whom thou hast perhaps heard.\"    \"I heard some news from Ikki (his quills make him presumptuous) of a  man-thing that was entered into a wolf pack, but I did not believe. Ikki  is full of stories half heard and very badly told.\"    \"But it is true. He is such a man-cub as never was,\" said Baloo. \"The  best and wisest and boldest of man-cubs--my own pupil, who shall  make the name of Baloo famous through all the jungles; and besides,  I--we--love him, Kaa.\"    \"Ts! Ts!\" said Kaa, weaving his head to and fro. \"I also have known what  love is. There are tales I could tell that--\"    \"That need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise properly,\"  said Bagheera quickly. \"Our man-cub is in the hands of the Bandar-log  now, and we know that of all the Jungle-People they fear Kaa alone.\"    \"They fear me alone. They have good reason,\" said Kaa. \"Chattering,  foolish, vain--vain, foolish, and chattering, are the monkeys. But a  man-thing in their hands is in no good luck. They grow tired of the nuts  they pick, and throw them down. They carry a branch half a day, meaning  to do great things with it, and then they snap it in two. That man-thing  is not to be envied. They called me also--`yellow fish' was it not?\"    \"Worm--worm--earth-worm,\" said Bagheera, \"as well as other things which  I cannot now say for shame.\"    \"We must remind them to speak well of their master. Aaa-ssp! We must  help their wandering memories. Now, whither went they with the cub?\"    \"The jungle alone knows. Toward the sunset, I believe,\" said Baloo. \"We  had thought that thou wouldst know, Kaa.\"    \"I? How? I take them when they come in my way, but I do not hunt the  Bandar-log, or frogs--or green scum on a water-hole, for that matter.\"    \"Up, Up! Up, Up! Hillo! Illo! Illo, look up, Baloo of the Seeonee Wolf  Pack!\"    Baloo looked up to see where the voice came from, and there was Rann the  Kite, sweeping down with the sun shining on the upturned flanges of his  wings. It was near Rann's bedtime, but he had ranged all over the jungle  looking for the Bear and had missed him in the thick foliage.    \"What is it?\" said Baloo.    \"I have seen Mowgli among the Bandar-log. He bade me tell you. I  watched. The Bandar-log have taken him beyond the river to the monkey  city--to the Cold Lairs. They may stay there for a night, or ten nights,  or an hour. I have told the bats to watch through the dark time. That is  my message. Good hunting, all you below!\"    \"Full gorge and a deep sleep to you, Rann,\" cried Bagheera. \"I will  remember thee in my next kill, and put aside the head for thee alone, O  best of kites!\"    \"It is nothing. It is nothing. The boy held the Master Word. I could  have done no less,\" and Rann circled up again to his roost.    \"He has not forgotten to use his tongue,\" said Baloo with a chuckle of  pride. \"To think of one so young remembering the Master Word for the  birds too while he was being pulled across trees!\"    \"It was most firmly driven into him,\" said Bagheera. \"But I am proud of  him, and now we must go to the Cold Lairs.\"    They all knew where that place was, but few of the Jungle People ever  went there, because what they called the Cold Lairs was an old deserted  city, lost and buried in the jungle, and beasts seldom use a place that  men have once used. The wild boar will, but the hunting tribes do not.  Besides, the monkeys lived there as much as they could be said to live  anywhere, and no self-respecting animal would come within eyeshot of it  except in times of drought, when the half-ruined tanks and reservoirs  held a little water.    \"It is half a night's journey--at full speed,\" said Bagheera, and Baloo  looked very serious. \"I will go as fast as I can,\" he said anxiously.    \"We dare not wait for thee. Follow, Baloo. We must go on the  quick-foot--Kaa and I.\"    \"Feet or no feet, I can keep abreast of all thy four,\" said Kaa shortly.  Baloo made one effort to hurry, but had to sit down panting, and so they  left him to come on later, while Bagheera hurried forward, at the quick  panther-canter. Kaa said nothing, but, strive as Bagheera might, the  huge Rock-python held level with him. When they came to a hill stream,  Bagheera gained, because he bounded across while Kaa swam, his head and  two feet of his neck clearing the water, but on level ground Kaa made up  the distance.    \"By the Broken Lock that freed me,\" said Bagheera, when twilight had  fallen, \"thou art no slow goer!\"    \"I am hungry,\" said Kaa. \"Besides, they called me speckled frog.\"    \"Worm--earth-worm, and yellow to boot.\"    \"All one. Let us go on,\" and Kaa seemed to pour himself along the  ground, finding the shortest road with his steady eyes, and keeping to  it.    In the Cold Lairs the Monkey-People were not thinking of Mowgli's  friends at all. They had brought the boy to the Lost City, and were  very much pleased with themselves for the time. Mowgli had never seen an  Indian city before, and though this was almost a heap of ruins it seemed  very wonderful and splendid. Some king had built it long ago on a little  hill. You could still trace the stone causeways that led up to the  ruined gates where the last splinters of wood hung to the worn, rusted  hinges. Trees had grown into and out of the walls; the battlements were  tumbled down and decayed, and wild creepers hung out of the windows of  the towers on the walls in bushy hanging clumps.    A great roofless palace crowned the hill, and the marble of the  courtyards and the fountains was split, and stained with red and green,  and the very cobblestones in the courtyard where the king's elephants  used to live had been thrust up and apart by grasses and young trees.  From the palace you could see the rows and rows of roofless houses that  made up the city looking like empty honeycombs filled with blackness;  the shapeless block of stone that had been an idol in the square where  four roads met; the pits and dimples at street corners where the public  wells once stood, and the shattered domes of temples with wild figs  sprouting on their sides. The monkeys called the place their city, and  pretended to despise the Jungle-People because they lived in the forest.  And yet they never knew what the buildings were made for nor how to  use them. They would sit in circles on the hall of the king's"]]]
