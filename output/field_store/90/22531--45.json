Tell your uncle it is not true, and beg him to  help you clear yourself from this disgrace.\"    The lad made no reply, merely crossing his legs, and made his  shoe-buckles rasp together as he slowly moved his feet.    \"Don!\"    He looked up strangely, met his mother's earnest appealing gaze, and for  the moment his better nature prevailed; but as he looked from her to his  uncle, and saw the old man's grey eyes fixed upon him searchingly, a  feeling of obstinate anger swept over him again, and made him set his  teeth, as something seemed to whisper to him, \"No; you told the truth,  and he would not believe you.  Let him prove you guilty if he can!\"    It was not the first time in history that a boy had stubbornly fought  against his better self, and allowed the worst part of his nature to  prevail.    \"Do you not hear me, Don?\" cried his mother.  \"Why do you not speak?\"    Don remained silent, and Kitty, as she looked at him, angrily uttered an  impatient ejaculation.    \"Don, my son, for my sake speak to your uncle.  Do you not hear me?\"    \"Yes, mother.\"    \"Then appeal to him to help you.  Ask him to forgive you if you have  done wrong.\"    \"And she believes me guilty, too,\" thought Don, as he scowled at his  feet.    \"But you have not done wrong, my boy.  I, your mother, will not believe  it of you.\"    Don's better self began to force down that side of his mental scale.    \"You may have been weak and foolish, Don, but nothing worse.\"    The evil scale went down now in turn, and with it the foolish, ignorant  boy's heart sank low.    \"Come, Don.\"    \"I've nothing more to say, mother.\"    \"Nothing more to say!\" cried Mrs Lavington, wildly.  \"Oh, yes, yes, you  have much to say, my boy.  Come, throw away this wilful pride and  obstinacy.\"    \"I wish I could,\" thought Don one moment.  \"It is as cruel as it is  unjust,\" he thought the next; and he felt more obstinately full of pride  than ever.    \"Don, I command you to speak,\" said Mrs Lavington, whose manner now  began to change; but unfortunately the stern tone she adopted had the  wrong effect, and the wrinkles in the boy's face grew deeper, and the  position more strained.    If Uncle Josiah, who had never had boys of his own, had come down from  the lofty perch he had assumed, taken the boy's hand, and said in kindly  and frank tones, \"Come, Don, my boy, there are troubles enough in life,  clouds sufficient to obscure too much sunshine; speak out, let's have  all this over, and clear the storm away,\"--if he had said something like  that, Don would have melted, and all would have been well; but  accustomed to manage men with an iron rule, Uncle Josiah had somehow, in  spite of his straightforward, manly, and just character, seemed to repel  the boy whose charge he had taken, and instead now of making the  slightest advance, he said to himself, \"It is not my duty to eat humble  pie before the obstinate young cub.  It will be a severe lesson for him,  and will do him good.\"    So the breach widened.  Don seemed to grow sulky and sullen, when he was  longing to cast himself upon his mother's neck.  The poor woman felt  indignant at her son's conduct, and the last straw which broke the  camel's back was laid on the top of the load by Kitty, who, moved by a  desire to do good, made matters far worse by running across to Don, and  in an impetuous way catching his hands and kissing him.    \"Don, dear!\" she cried.    The boy's face lit up.  Here was some one who would believe him after  all, and he responded to her advances by grasping her hands tightly in  his.    \"Do, do speak, Don dear, and beg father to forgive you,\" she cried.  \"Tell him it was a mistake, and that you will never do so again.\"    Don let fall her hands, the deep scowl came over his brow again, and he  half turned away.    \"No, no, Don, dear,\" she whispered; \"pray don't be obstinate.  Confess  that you did it, and promise father to do better in the future.  He will  forgive you; I know he will.\"    Don turned his back with an impatient gesture, and Kitty burst into  tears, and went slowly to her aunt, to whose hands she clung.    \"Laura, dear,\" said Uncle Josiah, gravely, \"I think we had better bring  this painful interview to an end.  You may rest assured that I shall do  what is just and right by Don.  He shall have every opportunity for  clearing himself.\"    \"I am not guilty,\" cried Don, fiercely throwing back his head.    \"I thought so this morning, my boy,\" said the old merchant, gravely.  \"Your conduct now is making me think very differently.  Laura, I will  walk home with you, if you please.\"    \"Josiah!  Don, my boy, pray, pray speak,\" cried Mrs Lavington,  piteously.    Don heard her appeal, and it thrilled him, but his uncle's words had  raised up an obstinacy that was stronger than ever, and while longing to  throw himself in his mother's arms--passionately longing so to do--his  indignant pride held him back, and he stood with his head bent, as in  obedience to her brother Mrs Lavington took his arm, and allowed him to  lead her out of the office, weeping bitterly the while.    Don did not look up to meet his mother's yearning gaze, but for months  and years after he seemed to see that look when far away in the midst of  peril, and too late he bitterly upbraided himself for his want of  frankness and power to subdue his obstinate pride.    \"He thinks me guilty!\" he said to himself, as he stood with his head  bent, listening, and unaware of the fact that some one was still in the  room, till a light step came towards him, his hand was caught, and his  cheek rapidly kissed.    \"Kitty!\"    \"Coming, father.\"    Then there was a rapid step, the door closed, and Don stood in the same  attitude, listening to the steps on the gravel, and then to the bang of  the wicket-gate.    Alone with his thoughts, and they were many and strange.    What should he do?  Go right away, and--and--    \"Mas' Don.\"    He looked up, and Jem stood at the door.        CHAPTER SIX.    JEM WIMBLE TALKS SENSE.    \"May I come in?\"    Don nodded.    \"The master's gone, and took the ladies 'long with him.  Why, don't look  like that, my lad.  Your uncle don't think you took the money?\"    Don nodded.    \"But your mother don't, sir?\"    \"Yes, Jem, she believes me guilty too.\"    \"I never did!\" cried Jem, excitedly.  \"But sure-_lie_ Miss Kitty don't?\"    \"Yes, Jem, they all think I'm a thief.  Everybody does,\" cried Don,  passionately.    \"No, everybody don't,\" said Jem, fiercely; \"so don't talk like that,  Mas' Don.  Why, even I couldn't ha' stole that money--me, as is only  yard-man, and nothing o' no consequence t'other day.  So if I couldn't  ha' done it, I'm quite sure as you, as is a young gentleman born and  bred, couldn't.\"    \"But they think I did.  Everybody thinks so.\"    \"Tell yer everybody don't think so,\" cried Jem, sharply.  \"I don't, and  as for them, they've all got dust in their eyes, that's what's the  matter with them, and they can't see clear.  But didn't you tell 'em as  you didn't?\"    \"Yes, Jem,\" said Don, despondently; \"at first.\"    \"Then why didn't you at last, too?  Here, cheer up, my lad; it'll all  blow over and be forgotten, same as the row was about that  sugar-hogshead as I let them take away.  I don't say shake hands 'cause  you're like master and me only man, but I shakes hands with you in my  'art, my lad, and I says, don't be down over it.\"    \"You couldn't shake hands with a thief, you mean, Jem,\" said Don,  bitterly.    \"Look here, Mas' Don, I can't punch your head because, as aforesaid,  you're young master, and I'm only man; but for that there same what you  said just now I hits you in my 'art.  Thief indeed!  But ah, my lad, it  was a pity as you ever let Mike come into the office to tell you his  lies about furren parts.\"    \"Yes, Jem, it was.\"    \"When you might ha' got all he told you out o' books, and the stories  wouldn't ha' been quite so black.\"    \"Ah, well, it's all over now.\"    \"What's all over?\"    \"My life here, Jem.  I shall go right away.\"    \"Go?  What?\"    \"Right away.  Abroad, I think.\"    \"And what'll your mother do?\"    \"Forget me, I hope.  I always was an unlucky fellow Jem.\"    \"What d'yer mean?  Run away?\"    \"Yes, I shall go away.\"    \"Well, that's clever, that is.  Why, that's just the way to make 'em  think you did it.  Tshah!  You stop like a man and face it out.\"    \"When everybody believes me guilty?\"    \"Don't be so precious aggrawatin', my lad,\" cried Jem, plaintively.  \"Don't I keep on a-telling you that I don't believe you guilty.  Why,  I'd just as soon believe that I stole our sugar and sold bundles of  tobacco-leaves to the marine store shops.\"    Don shook his head.    \"Well, of all the aggrawatin' chaps I ever did see, you're 'bout the  worst, Mas' Don.  Don't I tell you it'll be all right?\"    \"No, Jem, it will not be all right.  I shall have to go before the  magistrates.\"    \"Well, what of that?\"    \"What of that?\" cried Don, passionately.  \"Why, that scoundrel Mike will  keep to his story.\"    \"Let him!\" cried Jem, contemptuously.  \"Why, who'd ever believe him i'  preference to you?\"    \"My uncle--my mother--my cousin.\"    \"Not they, my boy.  They don't believe it.  They only think they do.  They're sore just now, while it's all fresh.  To-morrow by this time  they will be a-hanging o' themselves round about your neck, and a-askin'  of your pardon, and kissin' of you.\"    \"No, Jem, no.\"    \"Well, I don't mean as your uncle will be kissin' of you, of course; but  he'll be sorry too, and a-shaking of your hand.\"    Don shook his head.    \"There, don't get wagging your head like a Chinee figger, my lad.  Take  it like a man.\"    \"It seems that the only thing for me to do, Jem, is to tie up a bundle  and take a stick, and go and try my luck somewhere else.\"    \"And you free and independent!  Why, what would you say if you was me,  tied up and married, and allus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21322"],[0,"The Tale of Betsy Butterfly (#7)"],[1,"to meet your friend, why don't you ask her  for her picture?\"    \"That's a splendid idea!\" Freddie cried. \"How in the world did you ever  happen to think of it, Mr. Owl?\"    Solomon Owl hooted at that question.    \"That's my secret,\" he said. \"If I told all I know, everybody else would  be just as wise as I am.\" And after giving another long string of hoots,  which he followed with a burst of loud laughter, Solomon Owl popped into  his house.    Anyhow, Freddie Firefly couldn't complain, for he now had a remedy for  his trouble. And he felt so carefree and happy again that on his way  across the meadow he stopped to talk with Jimmy Rabbit, who was taking a  stroll in the direction of Farmer Green's cabbage patch.    Freddie Firefly quickly told Jimmy all about his affair with Dusty Moth.  He even explained how he had gone to ask Solomon Owl's help, and related  what that wise bird had advised.    \"There's only one thing that worries me now,\" said Freddie Firefly  anxiously. \"I'm wondering whether Betsy Butterfly has ever had a picture  made of herself.\"          XIX    A BIT OF LUCK      JIMMY RABBIT promptly set Freddie Firefly's fears at rest.    \"I happen to know,\" said he, \"that Betsy Butterfly has a picture of  herself.\"    \"Are you sure?\" Freddie asked him eagerly.    \"I ought to be,\" replied Jimmy Rabbit, \"because I painted it myself, the  very next day after I finished a portrait of old Mr. Crow.\"    \"It ought to be a good one, if you made it,\" said Freddie. \"But wasn't  it some time ago that you were an artist?\"    \"It was earlier in the summer,\" Jimmy Rabbit admitted. \"Of course,  Betsy Butterfly has changed somewhat since then. But this picture was a  fine likeness of her at the time I painted it.... I suppose,\" he added,  \"I was the first one in the whole valley to perceive that she was going  to be a beauty when she got her full growth.\"    \"Do you suppose she'll send me the picture, if I ask her, so I can show  it to Dusty Moth?\" Freddie asked.    Jimmy Rabbit looked a bit doubtful. He pondered for a few moments. And  then he said:    \"I'll tell you what I'll do! To-morrow morning I'll see Betsy and I've  no doubt that she'll loan me the picture if I promise to return it to  her.\"    \"That'll be great!\" cried Freddie. \"Meet me near the duck pond as soon  as it's dark to-morrow night; and be sure to bring Betsy's picture with  you!\"    Then Freddie Firefly hurried off to find Dusty Moth, who happened  likewise to be looking for him, because he had a question to ask.    They met shortly. And Dusty Moth immediately cried:    \"Have you heard from her?\"--meaning Betsy Butterfly, of course.    \"Now, see here!\" Freddie Firefly said. \"It's plain enough that Betsy  doesn't care to meet you. But I have a plan that ought to suit you well  enough. If you could look at her picture once you'd be satisfied,  wouldn't you?\"    \"I would--\" replied Dusty Moth--\"if I got my appetite back afterward.\"    \"Well, will you promise to stop pestering me about Betsy Butterfly if I  let you see this picture of her?\"    \"Yes! yes!\" Dusty promised impatiently. \"Where is it? Quick! Let me see  it!\"    \"Oh! You'll have to wait till to-morrow night,\" Freddie explained.    \"I shall not be able to eat a single mouthful till then!\" Dusty Moth  groaned.    \"Well--you can suit yourself about that,\" Freddie told him impatiently.  \"And please don't speak to me again to-night! I've been troubled enough  on your account without being bothered by you any more.\"    \"One moment!\" cried Dusty, as Freddie Firefly started to leave him.    \"Well--what do you want now?\" Freddie growled, flashing his light  impatiently in Dusty Moth's eyes.    \"Are you sure she will let you take the picture?\" Dusty asked him.    \"Yes! yes! Of course she will! Why shouldn't she, I should like to know?  You certainly do ask the silliest questions!\"    And yet Freddie Firefly had put the same query himself, to Jimmy Rabbit,  only a short time before. But now he was quite certain that his worries  were almost at an end.    \"Betsy Butterfly has caused me a powerful lot of trouble!\" Freddie  grumbled, as he hurried over the hollow, to join in the dance of the  Firefly family.          XX    SOMETHING SEEMS WRONG      WHEN Jimmy Rabbit went to see Betsy Butterfly the next morning he found  her quite willing to let him take her picture away with him.    \"But I must say--\" Betsy remarked--\"I must say that I don't understand  why anybody should want to borrow this old portrait. Everyone tells me I  have changed a great deal since you made it.\"    \"That's true,\" Jimmy Rabbit agreed. \"But the person to whom I'm going to  show it won't know the difference.\"    \"I don't believe he knows me, then,\" she remarked.    \"No! And probably he never will,\" said Jimmy Rabbit. \"But don't you  worry about that! From what I hear of him, he's a good deal of a bore.\"    \"Don't bother to bring back that picture!\" she called to Jimmy Rabbit as  he hopped away.    \"I'm afraid Betsy Butterfly is growing vain,\" he murmured to himself.  \"To be sure, she _has_ changed. But I shall always like this portrait of  her, because I painted it myself.\"    Later, when he was in Farmer Green's garden, he wrapped the picture  carefully in a rhubarb leaf and hid it beneath a pile of brush. And he  didn't come back for it until after dark, just as the moon peeped above  the rim of the hills.    At the duck pond Jimmy Rabbit found Freddie Firefly waiting for him,  hopping up and down and flashing his light through the misty gloom.    \"Did you get it?\" Freddie demanded.    \"It's safe in my pocket,\" Jimmy assured him.    \"Let me have it!\" said Freddie. \"Dusty Moth is waiting for me at the  fence-corner, near the orchard. And I want to give him a good look at  Betsy Butterfly's picture before the moon gets too high, for he can't  see well if there's too much light.\"    Jimmy Rabbit drew the picture carefully from his pocket. And Freddie  Firefly took it and slung it across his back. He fairly staggered under  the weight.    \"Aren't you going to look at Betsy's picture yourself?\" Jimmy Rabbit  asked him. \"It's a good bit of work, if I do say so.\"    \"Oh! I don't care about seeing it. It's nothing to me, you know,\" said  Freddie carelessly. \"But I hope Dusty Moth will be satisfied with it.\"    \"Well, I won't go with you, to see if he is,\" Jimmy Rabbit told him. \"I  usually have a light lunch at this hour. So I'll meet you here at the  duck pond after I come back from the cabbage patch.\"    They parted then. And shortly afterward Freddie Firefly dropped down  beside Dusty Moth, who made no attempt to conceal his pleasure.    \"At last!\" he cried. \"At last I am to behold the beautiful Betsy  Butterfly's picture!... I do hope it's a good likeness!\" he added as he  began, with trembling hands, to unwrap the rhubarb covering from the  portrait.    \"It certainly is,\" Freddie Firefly assured him. \"It was made by a friend  of mine, who once painted a famous picture of old Mr. Crow.\"    While Freddie danced along the top of the fence, Dusty Moth carried the  picture into the shade of an apple tree, out of the moonlight, so that  he might see it more clearly.    A few moments later Freddie Firefly was both surprised and alarmed to  hear a cry of anguish from the direction of the apple tree.    \"What's the matter?\" he called. \"There's nothing wrong, I hope?\"    But Dusty Moth made no reply.          XXI    A STRANGE CHANGE      RECEIVING no answer to his question, Freddie Firefly skipped down from  the fence and sought the shade of the apple tree, where he found Dusty  Moth staring fixedly at Betsy Butterfly's picture.    Dusty's face wore a most curious look; he seemed at once angry,  sorrowful and amazed. And not till Freddie Firefly asked again what  _was_ the trouble did Dusty Moth say a word.    Then he pointed scornfully toward the portrait that Jimmy Rabbit had  made earlier in the summer.    \"So that's the charming Betsy Butterfly, eh?\" he roared. \"That's the  beauty I've heard so much about! I can tell you right now that if I had  any idea she looked like this I never would have lost my appetite over  her!\"    \"You astonish me!\" Freddie Firefly exclaimed. \"Have you forgotten how  anxious you were to meet the lady?\"    \"Meet her!\" Dusty Moth howled. \"I promise you I'd never go out of my way  to meet anybody that looked as she does--though I might go a long  distance to avoid her.\"    Freddie Firefly glanced toward the picture. But it had fallen face  downward upon the ground. And he did not take the trouble to raise it.    \"Well, you think Betsy Butterfly is beautiful, don't you?\" he asked.    \"Indeed I don't! I think she's hideous,\" Dusty Moth shouted. \"Never in  all my life have I been so deceived in a person.\"    \"I don't understand how you can say that,\" Freddie Firefly told him.  \"But I suppose your idea of beauty may be different from mine--and from  many other people's, too. Anyhow, I hope you'll get your appetite back  again.\"    \"I don't know about that,\" said Dusty Moth. \"Just now I don't feel as if  I ever wanted to taste food again.\" A shudder passed over him. And he  covered his eyes, as if to shut some terrible image from his memory.    \"I must leave you now,\" said Freddie Firefly. \"And please don't forget  what you promised me. You remember that you said that if I'd show you a  picture of Betsy Butterfly you would stop pestering me about her.\"    \"Don't worry about that!\" Dusty Moth assured him bitterly. \"I shall  never mention Betsy Butterfly's name again. I don't want to think of  her. But I'm afraid I can never, never get her face out of my mind.... I  know--\" he added--\"I know I shall see it in my dreams. And just think  how terrible it will be to wake at midday, out of a sound sleep, with  her dreadful face and form haunting me!\"    Freddie Firefly couldn't help feeling sorry for the poor chap. But he  could think of nothing to do, except to show him Betsy's portrait once  more. So he started to"]]]
