It is a lucky  circumstance, however, that her reputation will not suffer any  detriment, but rather derive advantage from the discovery; which  will prove, at least, that it is not quite so rotten as most people  imagined--For my own part, I declare to you, in all the sincerity of  friendship, that, far from having any amorous intercourse with the  object in question, I never had the least acquaintance with her person;  but, if she is really in the condition you describe, I suspect Mansel to  be at the bottom of the whole. His visits to that shrine were no secret;  and this attachment, added to some good offices, which you know he has  done me, since I left Alma-mater, give me a right to believe him capable  of saddling me with this scandal, when my back was turned--Nevertheless,  if my name can be of any service to him, he is welcome to make use of  it; and if the woman should be abandoned enough to swear his banding to  me, I must beg the favour of you to compound with the parish: I shall  pay the penalty without repining; and you will be so good as to draw  upon me immediately for the sum required--On this occasion, I act by the  advice of my uncle; who says I shall have good-luck if I pass through  life without being obliged to make many more compositions of the same  kind. The old gentleman told me last night, with great good-humour, that  betwixt the age of twenty and forty, he had been obliged to provide for  nine bastards, sworn to him by women whom he never saw--Mr Bramble's  character, which seems to interest you greatly, opens and improves upon  me every day. His singularities afford a rich mine of entertainment;  his understanding, so far as I can judge, is well cultivated; his  observations on life are equally just, pertinent, and uncommon. He  affects misanthropy, in order to conceal the sensibility of a heart,  which is tender, even to a degree of weakness. This delicacy of feeling,  or soreness of the mind, makes him timorous and fearful; but then he  is afraid of nothing so much as of dishonour; and although he is  exceedingly cautious of giving offence, he will fire at the least hint  of insolence or ill-breeding.--Respectable as he is, upon the whole,  I can't help being sometimes diverted by his little distresses; which  provoke him to let fly the shafts of his satire, keen and penetrating  as the arrows of Teucer--Our aunt, Tabitha, acts upon him as a perpetual  grind-stone--She is, in all respects, a striking contrast to her  brother--But I reserve her portrait for another occasion.    Three days ago we came hither from the Hot Well, and took possession  of the first floor of a lodging-house, on the South Parade; a situation  which my uncle chose, for its being near the Bath, and remote from the  noise of carriages. He was scarce warm in the lodgings when he called  for his night-cap, his wide shoes, and flannel; and declared himself  invested with the gout in his right foot; though, I believe it had as  yet reached no farther than his imagination. It was not long before he  had reason to repent his premature declaration; for our aunt Tabitha  found means to make such a clamour and confusion, before the flannels  could be produced from the trunk, that one would have imagined the house  was on fire. All this time, uncle sat boiling with impatience, biting  his fingers, throwing up his eyes, and muttering ejaculations; at length  he burst into a kind of convulsive laugh, after which he hummed a song;  and when the hurricane was over, exclaimed 'Blessed be God for all  things!' This, however, was but the beginning of his troubles. Mrs  Tabitha's favourite dog Chowder, having paid his compliments to a female  turnspit of his own species, in the kitchen, involved himself in a  quarrel with no fewer than five rivals, who set upon him at once, and  drove him up stairs to the dining room door, with hideous noise: there  our aunt and her woman, taking arms in his defence, joined the  concert; which became truly diabolical. This fray being with difficulty  suppressed, by the intervention of our own footman and the cook-maid  of the house, the squire had just opened his mouth, to expostulate with  Tabby, when the town-waits, in the passage below, struck up their music  (if music it may be called) with such a sudden burst of sound, as made  him start and stare, with marks of indignation and disquiet. He had  recollection enough to send his servant with some money to silence those  noisy intruders; and they were immediately dismissed, though not without  some opposition on the part of Tabitha, who thought it but reasonable  that he should have more music for his money. Scarce had he settled this  knotty point, when a strange kind of thumping and bouncing was heard  right over-head, in the second story, so loud and violent, as to shake  the whole building. I own I was exceedingly provoked at this new alarm;  and before my uncle had time to express himself on the subject, I ran  up stairs, to see what was the matter. Finding the room-door open, I  entered without ceremony, and perceived an object, which I can not now  recollect without laughing to excess--It was a dancing master, with his  scholar, in the act of teaching. The master was blind of one eye, and  lame of one foot, and led about the room his pupil; who seemed to be  about the age of threescore, stooped mortally, was tall, raw-boned,  hard-favoured, with a woollen night-cap on his head; and he had stript  off his coat, that he might be more nimble in his motions--Finding  himself intruded upon, by a person he did not know, he forthwith girded  himself with a long iron sword, and advancing to me, with a peremptory  air, pronounced, in a true Hibernian accent, 'Mister What d'ye callum,  by my saoul and conscience, I am very glad to sea you, if you are after  coming in the way of friendship; and indeed, and indeed now, I believe  you are my friend sure enough, gra; though I never had the honour to sea  your face before, my dear; for becaase you come like a friend, without  any ceremony at all, at all'--I told him the nature of my visit would  not admit of ceremony; that I was come to desire he would make less  noise, as there was a sick gentleman below, whom he had no right  to disturb with such preposterous doings. 'Why, look-ye now, young  gentleman (replied this original) perhaps, upon another occasion, I  might shivilly request you to explain the maining of that hard word,  prepasterous: but there's a time for all things, honey'--So saying,  he passed me with great agility, and, running down stairs, found our  foot-man at the dining-room door, of whom he demanded admittance, to  pay his respects to the stranger. As the fellow did not think proper  to refuse the request of such a formidable figure, he was immediately  introduced, and addressed himself to my uncle in these words: 'Your  humble servant, good sir,--I'm not so prepasterous, as your son calls  it, but I know the rules of shivility--I'm a poor knight of Ireland,  my name is sir Ulic Mackilligut, of the county of Galway; being your  fellow-lodger, I'm come to pay my respects, and to welcome you to the  South Parade, and to offer my best services to you, and your good lady,  and your pretty daughter; and even to the young gentleman your son,  though he thinks me a prepasterous fellow--You must know I am to have  the honour to open a ball next door to-morrow with lady Mac Manus; and  being rusted in my dancing, I was refreshing my memory with a little  exercise; but if I had known there was a sick person below, by Christ!  I would have sooner danced a hornpipe upon my own head, than walk the  softest minuet over yours.'--My uncle, who was not a little startled at  his first appearance, received his compliment with great complacency,  insisted upon his being seated, thanked him for the honour of his visit,  and reprimanded me for my abrupt expostulation with a gentleman of his  rank and character. Thus tutored, I asked pardon of the knight, who,  forthwith starting up, embraced me so close, that I could hardly  breathe; and assured me, he loved me as his own soul. At length,  recollecting his night-cap, he pulled it off in some confusion; and,  with his bald-pate uncovered, made a thousand apologies to the ladies,  as he retired--At that instant, the Abbey bells, began to ring so  loud, that we could not hear one another speak; and this peal, as  we afterwards learned, was for the honour of Mr Bullock, an eminent  cowkeeper of Tottenham, who had just arrived at Bath, to drink the  waters for indigestion. Mr Bramble had not time to make his remarks upon  the agreeable nature of this serenade, before his ears were saluted with  another concert that interested him more nearly. Two negroes, belonging  to a Creole gentleman, who lodged in the same house, taking their  station at a window in the stair-case, about ten feet from our  dining-room door, began to practise upon the French-horn; and being in  the very first rudiments of execution, produced such discordant sounds,  as might have discomposed the organs of an ass. You may guess what  effect they had upon the irritable nerves of uncle; who, with the most  admirable expression of splenetic surprize in his countenance, sent  his man to silence these dreadful blasts, and desire the musicians to  practise in some other place, as they had no right to stand there and  disturb all the lodgers in the house. Those sable performers, far from  taking the hint, and withdrawing, treated the messenger with great  insolence; bidding him carry his compliments to their master, colonel  Rigworm, who would give him a proper answer, and a good drubbing into  the bargain; in the mean time they continued their noise, and even  endeavoured to make it more disagreeable; laughing between whiles, at  the thoughts of being able to torment their betters with impunity. Our  'squire, incensed at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21614"],[0,"For the Temple: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem (#7)"],[1,"re, Isaac, safe and well.\"    There was a confused sound, of shouts and cries of pleasure. In a  few minutes, the boat grated on the shallow shore. The moment she  did so, John leaped out over the bow and waded ashore, and was at  once clasped in his mother's arms; while one of the fishermen  carried Mary to the land. She received, from Martha, a full share  of her caresses; for she loved the girl almost as dearly as she did  her son. Then Miriam and the maids embraced and kissed her, while  Isaac folded John in his arms.    \"The God of Israel be thanked and praised, my children!\" Martha  exclaimed. \"He has brought you back to us, as from the dead, for we  never thought to see you again. Some of the fishermen returned, and  told us that they saw your boat, far on the lake, before the storm  burst; and none held out hope that you could have weathered such a  storm.\"    \"Where is father?\" John asked.    \"He is out on the lake, as are all the fishermen of the village,  searching for you.    \"That reminds me, Isaac, set fire to the other piles of wood that  we have prepared.    \"If one of the boats returned, with any sure news of you, we were  to light them to call the others back--one fire if the news was  bad, two if it was good--but we hardly even dared to hope that the  second would be required.\"    A brand from the fire was soon applied to the other piles, and the  three fires shone out across the lake, with the good news. In a  quarter of an hour a boat was seen approaching, and soon came a  shout:    \"Is all well?\"    \"All is well,\" John shouted, in reply, and soon he was clasped in  his father's arms.    The other boats came in, one by one; the last to arrive towing in  the boat--which had been found, bottom upwards, far up the lake,  its discovery destroying the last hope of its late occupants being  found alive.    As soon as Simon landed, the party returned to the house. Miriam  and the maids hurried to prepare a meal--of which all were sorely  in need, for no food had been eaten since the gale burst on the  lake; while their three hours in the boat had again sharpened the  appetite of John and Mary. A quantity of food was cooked, and a  skin of old wine brought up from the cellar; and Isaac remained  down on the shore, to bid all who had been engaged in the search  come up and feast, as soon as they landed.    John related to his parents the adventure which had befallen them,  and they wondered greatly at the narrowness of their deliverance.  When the feasting was over, Simon called all together, and solemnly  returned thanks to God for the mercies which He had given them. It  was broad daylight before all sought their beds, for a few hours,  before beginning the work of the day.    A week later Josephus himself came to Hippos, bringing with him two  nobles, who had fled from King Agrippa and sought refuge with him.  He had received them hospitably, and had allotted a home to them at  Tarichea, where he principally dwelt.    He had, just before, had another narrow escape, for six hundred  armed men--robbers and others--had assembled round his house,  charging him with keeping some spoils which had been taken, by a  party of men of that town, from the wife of Ptolemy--King Agrippa's  procurator--instead of dividing them among the people. For a time,  he pacified them by telling them that this money was destined for  strengthening the walls of their town, and for walling other towns  at present undefended; but the leaders of the evildoers were  determined to set his house on fire, and slay him.    He had but twenty armed men with him. Closing the doors, he went to  an upper room, and told the robbers to send in one of their number  to receive the money. Directly he entered, the door was closed. One  of his hands was cut off, and hung round his neck; and he was then  turned out again. Believing that Josephus would not have ventured  to act so boldly, had he not had a large body of armed men with  him, the crowd were seized with panic and fled to their homes.    After this, the enemies of Josephus persuaded the people that the  nobles he had sheltered were wizards; and demanded that they should  be given up to be slain, unless they would change their religion to  that of the Jews. Josephus tried to argue them out of their belief,  saying that there were no such things as wizards and, if the Romans  had wizards who could work them wrong, they would not need to send  an army to fight against them; but as the people still clamored, he  got the men privately on board a ship, and sailed across the lake  with them to Hippos; where he dismissed them, with many presents.    As soon as the news came that Josephus had come to Hippos, Simon  set out with Martha, John, and Mary, to see him. Josephus received  them kindly, and would permit no thanks for what he had done.    \"Your son is a brave youth,\" he said to Simon, \"and I would gladly  have him near me, if you would like to have it so. This is a time  when there are greater things than planting vineyards, and  gathering in harvests, to be done; and there is a need for brave  and faithful men. If, then, you and your wife will give the lad to  me, I will see to him, and keep him near me. I have need of  faithful men with me, for my enemies are ever trying to slay me. If  all goes well with the lad, he will have a good opportunity of  rising to honor.    \"What say you? Do not give an answer hastily, but think it over  among yourselves and, if you agree to my proposal, send him across  the lake to me.\"    \"It needs no thought, sir,\" Simon said. \"I know well that there are  more urgent things, now, than sowing and reaping; and that much  trouble and peril threaten the land. Right glad am I that my son  should serve one who is the hope of Israel, and his mother will not  grudge him for such service. As to advancement, I wish nothing  better than that he should till the land of his fathers; but none  can say what the Lord has in store for us, or whether strangers may  not reap what I have sown. Thus, then, the wisdom which he will  gain, in being with you, is likely to be a far better inheritance  than any I can give him.    \"What say you, Martha?\"    \"I say as you do, Simon. It will grieve me to part with him, but I  know that such an offer as that which my lord Josephus makes is  greatly for his good. Moreover, the manner in which he was saved  from death seems to show that the Lord has something for his hand  to do, and that his path is specially marked out for him. To refuse  to let him go would be to commit the sin of withstanding God--    \"Therefore, my lord, I willingly give up my son to follow you.\"    \"I think that you have decided wisely,\" Josephus said. \"I tarry  here, for tonight, and tomorrow cross to Tiberias; therefore, let  him be here by noon.\"    Mary was the most silent of the party, on the way home. Simon and  his wife felt convinced the decision they had made was a wise one  and, although they were not ambitious, they yet felt that the offer  of Josephus was a most advantageous one, and opened a career of  honor to their son.    John, himself, was in a state of the highest delight. To be about  the person of Josephus seemed, to him, the greatest honor and  happiness. It opened the way to the performance of great actions,  which would bring honor to his father's name; and although he had  been, hitherto, prepared to settle down to the life of a cultivator  of the soil, he had had his yearnings for one of more excitement  and adventure; and these were now likely to be gratified, to the  fullest.    Mary, however, felt the approaching loss of her friend and playmate  greatly, though even she was not insensible to the honor which the  offer of Josephus conferred upon him.    \"You don't seem glad of my good fortune, Mary,\" John said as, after  they returned home, they strolled together, as usual, down to the  edge of the lake.    \"It may be your good fortune, but it's not mine,\" the girl said,  pettishly. \"It will be very dull here, without you. I know what it  will be. Your mother will always be full of anxiety, and will be  fretting whenever we get news of any disturbances; and that is  often enough, for there seem to be disturbances, continually. Your  father will go about silently, Miriam will be sharper than usual  with the maids, and everything will go wrong. I can't see why you  couldn't have said that, in a year or two, you would go with the  governor; but that, at present, you thought you had better stop  with your own people.\"    \"A nice milksop he would have thought me!\" John laughed. \"No, if he  thought I was man enough to do him service, it would have been a  nice thing for me to say that I thought I was too young.    \"Besides, Mary, after all it is your good fortune, as well as mine;  for is it not settled that you are to share it? Josephus is all  powerful and, if I please him and do my duty, he can, in time,  raise me to a position of great honor. I may even come to be the  governor of a town, or a captain over troops, or a councilor.\"    \"No, no!\" Mary laughed, \"not a councilor, John. A governor,  perhaps; and a captain, perhaps; but never, I should say, a  councilor.\"    John laughed good temperedly.    \"Well, Mary, then you shall look forward to be the wife of a  governor, or captain; but you see, I might even fill the place of a  councilor with credit, because I could always come to you for  advice before, I give an opinion--then I should be sure to be  right.    \"But, seriously, Mary, I do think it great honor to have had such  an offer made me, by the governor.\"    \"Seriously, so do I, John; though I wish, in my heart, he had not  made it. I had looked forward to living here, all my life, just as  your mother has done; and now there will be nothing fixed to look  forward to.    \"Besides, where there is honor, there is danger. There seem to be  always tumults, always conspiracies--and then, as your father says,  above all there are"]]]
