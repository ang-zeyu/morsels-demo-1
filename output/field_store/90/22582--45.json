These are taken for the most part from among domesticated  animals which have been bred and crossed for a long time, and it is  hardly to be wondered at that their much mixed and much influenced  germ-plasm should, under certain conditions, give rise to remarkable  phenomena, often indeed producing forms which are strongly suggestive  of monstrosities, and which would undoubtedly not survive in free  nature, unprotected by man. I should regard such cases as due to an  intensified germinal selection--though this is to anticipate a  little--and from this point of view it cannot be denied that they have  a special interest. But they seem to me to have no significance as far  as the transformation of species is concerned, if only because of the  extreme rarity of their occurrence.    There are, however, many variations which have appeared in a sudden  and saltatory manner, and some of these Darwin pointed out and  discussed in detail: the copper beech, the weeping trees, the oak with  \"fern-like leaves,\" certain garden-flowers, etc. But none of them have  persisted in free nature, or evolved into permanent types.    On the other hand, wherever enduring types have arisen, we find traces  of a gradual origin by successive stages, even if, at first sight,  their origin may appear to have been sudden. This is the case with  _seasonal Dimorphism_, the first known cases of which exhibited marked  differences between the two generations, the winter and the summer  brood. Take for instance the much discussed and studied form  _Vanessa_ (_Araschnia_) _levana-prorsa_. Here the differences between  the two forms are so great and so apparently disconnected, that one  might almost believe it to be a sudden mutation, were it not that old  transition-stages can be called forth by particular temperatures, and  we know other butterflies, as for instance our Garden Whites, in which  the differences between the two generations are not nearly so marked;  indeed, they are so little apparent that they are scarcely likely to  be noticed except by experts. Thus here again there are small initial  steps, some of which, indeed, must be regarded as adaptations, such as  the green-sprinkled or lightly tinted under-surface which gives them a  deceptive resemblance to parsley or to Cardamine leaves.    Even if saltatory variations do occur, we cannot assume that these  _have ever led to forms which are capable of survival under the  conditions of wild life_. Experience has shown that in plants which  have suddenly varied the power of persistence is diminished.  Korschinsky attributes to them weaknesses of organisation in general;  \"they bloom late, ripen few of their seeds, and show great  sensitiveness to cold.\" These are not the characters which make for  success in the struggle for existence.    We must briefly refer here to the views--much discussed in the last  decade--of H. de Vries, who believes that the roots of transformation  must be sought for in _saltatory variations arising from internal  causes_, and distinguishes such _mutations_, as he has called them,  from ordinary individual variations, in that they breed true, that is,  with strict in-breeding they are handed on pure to the next  generation. I have elsewhere endeavoured to point out the weaknesses  of this theory,[33] and I am the less inclined to return to it here  that it now appears[34] that the far-reaching conclusions drawn by de  Vries from his observations on the Evening Primrose, _Oenothera  lamarckiana_, rest upon a very insecure foundation. The plant from  which de Vries saw numerous \"species\"--his \"mutations\"--arise was not,  as he assumed, a _wild species_ that had been introduced to Europe  from America, but was probably a hybrid form which was first  discovered in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, and which does not  appear to exist anywhere in America as a wild species.    This gives a severe shock to the \"Mutation theory,\" for the other  _actually wild_ species with which de Vries experimented showed no  \"mutations\" but yielded only negative results.    Thus we come to the conclusion that Darwin[35] was right in regarding  transformations as taking place by minute steps, which, if useful, are  augmented in the course of innumerable generations, because their  possessors more frequently survive in the struggle for existence.      (_b_) _Selection-value of the initial steps_    Is it possible that the insignificant deviations which we know as  \"individual variations\" can form the beginning of a process of  selection? Can they decide which is to perish and which to survive? To  use a phrase of Romanes, can they have _selection-value_?    Darwin himself answered this question, and brought together many  excellent examples to show that differences, apparently insignificant  because very small, might be of decisive importance for the life of  the possessor. But it is by no means enough to bring forward cases of  this kind, for the question is not merely whether finished adaptations  have selection-value, but whether the first beginnings of these, and  whether the small, I might almost say minimal increments, which have  led up from these beginnings to the perfect adaptation, have also had  selection-value. To this question even one who, like myself, has been  for many years a convinced adherent of the theory of selection, can  only reply: _We must assume so, but we cannot prove it in any case_.  It is not upon demonstrative evidence that we rely when we champion  the doctrine of selection as a scientific truth; we base our argument  on quite other grounds. Undoubtedly there are many apparently  insignificant features, which can nevertheless be shown to be  adaptations--for instance, the thickness of the basin-shaped shell of  the limpets that live among the breakers on the shore. There can be no  doubt that the thickness of these shells, combined with their flat  forms, protects the animals from the force of the waves breaking upon  them,--but how have they become so thick? What proportion of thickness  was sufficient to decide that of two variants of a limpet one should  survive, the other be eliminated? We can say nothing more than that we  infer from the present state of the shell, that it must have varied in  regard to differences in shell-thickness, and that these differences  must have had selection-value,--no proof therefore, but an assumption  which we must show to be convincing.    For a long time the marvellously complex _radiate_ and _lattice-work_  skeletons of Radiolarians were regarded as a mere outflow of \"Nature's  infinite wealth of form,\" as an instance of a purely morphological  character with no biological significance. But recent investigations  have shown that these, too, have an adaptive significance (Haecker).  The same thing has been shown by Schuett in regard to the lowly  unicellular plants, the Peridineae, which abound alike on the surface  of the ocean and in its depths. It has been shown that the long  skeletal processes which grow out from these organisms have  significance not merely as a supporting skeleton, but also as an  extension of the superficial area, which increases the contact with  the water-particles, and prevents the floating organisms from sinking.  It has been established that the processes are considerably shorter in  the colder layers of the ocean, and that they may be twelve times as  long[36] in the warmer layers, thus corresponding to the greater or  smaller amount of friction which takes place in the denser and less  dense layers of the water.    The Peridineae of the warmer ocean layers have thus become long-rayed,  those of the colder layers short-rayed, not through the direct effect  of friction on the protoplasm, but through processes of selection,  which favoured the longer rays in warm water, since they kept the  organism afloat, while those with short rays sank and were eliminated.  If we put the question as to selection-value in this case, and ask how  great the variations in the length of processes must be in order to  possess selection-value; what can we answer except that these  variations must have been minimal, and yet sufficient to prevent too  rapid sinking and consequent elimination? Yet this very case would  give the ideal opportunity for a mathematical calculation of the  minimal selection-value, although of course it is not feasible from  lack of data to carry out the actual calculation.    But even in organisms of more than microscopic size there must  frequently be minute, even microscopic differences which set going the  process of selection, and regulate its progress to the highest  possible perfection.    Many tropical trees possess thick, leathery leaves, as a protection  against the force of the tropical raindrops. The _direct_ influence of  the rain cannot be the cause of this power of resistance, for the  leaves, while they were still thin, would simply have been torn to  pieces. Their toughness must therefore be referred to selection, which  would favour the trees with slightly thicker leaves, though we cannot  calculate with any exactness how great the first stages of increase in  thickness must have been. Our hypothesis receives further support from  the fact that, in many such trees, the leaves are drawn out into a  beak-like prolongation (Stahl and Haberlandt) which facilitates the  rapid falling off of the rain water, and also from the fact that the  leaves, while they are still young, hang limply down in bunches which  offer the least possible resistance to the rain. Thus there are here  three adaptations which can only be interpreted as due to selection.  The initial stages of these adaptations must undoubtedly have had  selection-value.    But even in regard to this case we are reasoning in a circle, not  giving \"proofs,\" and no one who does not wish to believe in the  selection-value of the initial stages can be forced to do so.

All the while the under-water boat  continued to rain, shot and shell upon us, and at times was so close  that she was able to employ rifle fire effectively.    \"At last one shell blew the Captain off the bridge, killing him  outright and terribly mutilating him. Just before that he had given  orders to launch the boats, but this was very difficult under the  shell fire. Several men were struck down while working at the davits.  Ultimately four boats were got overboard and were rowed away until  picked up.\"    The son of Captain Parslow, serving as second mate, was standing by  his father's side when the Captain was killed. The son was knocked  down by the violence of the explosion. Springing to his feet, he  seized the wheel, and, as ably as his father had done, continued  dodging the submarine. Another shell burst alongside him, shattering  one of the spokes of the wheel, but young Parslow retained his post.    The wireless SOS calls that had been sent out at the first alarm had  reached those able to give more than passive assistance, however, and  British destroyers appeared. On their approach the submarine abandoned  the attack and submerged. Young Parslow was still at the wheel when  the destroyers came up.    [Illustration: War zone area showing where the Armenian, (British);  Normandy, (American); Anglo-Californian, (British), and Orduna,  (British) ships were attacked during the month of July.]      THE NORMANDY    _An Associated Press dispatch from Liverpool, dated July 13, 1915,  reported:_    How an American ship is alleged to have been used as a shield by a  German submarine for the sinking of another vessel is related by  members of the crew of the American bark Normandy, which has arrived  here from Gulfport, Miss.    The story is that the Normandy was stopped by a German submarine sixty  miles southwest of Tuskar Rock, off the southeast coast of Ireland,  Friday night. The captain was called aboard the submarine, whence his  papers were examined and found to show that the ship was chartered by  an American firm January 5.    The captain of the bark, it was asserted, was allowed to return to  the Normandy, but under the threat that his ship would be destroyed  unless he stood by and obeyed orders. These orders, it was stated,  were that he was to act as a shield for the submarine, which lay  around the side of the bark, hiding itself from an approaching vessel.    This vessel proved to be the Russian steamer Leo. Presently the  submarine submerged and proceeded around the bow of the Normandy, so  the story went, and ten minutes later the crew of the Normandy saw the  Leo blown up.    Twenty-five persons were on board, of whom eleven were drowned,  including three stewardesses. Those saved included three Americans,  Walter Emery of North Carolina, Harry Clark of Sierra, and Harry  Whitney of Camden, N.J. All these three men when interviewed  corroborated the above story. They declared that no opportunity was  given those on board the Leo for saving lives.    The Leo was bound from Philadelphia for Manchester with a general  cargo.    The Captain of the Normandy told the survivors that he would have  liked to signal their danger to them, but that he dared not do so,  because his uninsured ship would then have been instantly sunk.    _In a Washington dispatch to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES, _sent July 13,  appeared the following:_    The State Department received a short dispatch late this afternoon  from Consul General Washington at Liverpool, confirming the report  that three Americans were among those rescued by the American bark  Normandy at the time of the sinking of the Russian merchant steamer  Leo by a German submarine off the Irish coast Friday night. This is  the case in which press dispatches asserted that the submarine  commander forced the Captain of the Normandy to use his bark as a  shield behind which the submarine hid before firing the torpedo which  sank the Leo.    The cablegram from Consul General Washington makes no mention of this  phase of the affair, and does not show whether the German submarine  gave any warning to the commander of the Russian merchant ship before  firing the shot which destroyed the latter vessel. The official  message says that the Normandy was stopped by the submarine, that the  Normandy's papers were examined, and that she was allowed to proceed.  The message added that the Normandy rescued three American citizens  who were members of the crew of the Leo, and names them as Walter  Emery, seaman, of Swan Quarter, N.C.; Harry Whitney, steward, of  Camden, N.J., and Harry Clark, fireman, of 113 East Fifty-second  Street, Seattle, Wash.      THE ORDUNA    _This is the official statement of Captain Thomas M. Taylor of the  Cunard liner Orduna, concerning the attack made on his vessel by a  German submarine off Queenstown, westbound, on the morning of July 9:_    At 6.05 A.M., July 9, the lookout man on the after bridge rang the  telegraph, at the same time pointing his hand downward and out on the  port beam. The third officer was immediately sent aft to inquire what  was seen. He returned quickly and reported both men had seen a torpedo  pass across the stern from port to starboard, only ten feet clear of  the rudder. In the meantime both the chief officer and myself  distinctly saw the trail of the torpedo, extending from the stern to  about 200 yards out on the port beam. About eight minutes afterwards  the chief officer and I saw the submarine come to the surface about  two points on the starboard quarter, a distance of about  three-quarters of a mile, with five or six men on her deck, getting  her guns ready.    I immediately ordered all possible steam, altered the course, and  brought her right astern, when they began shelling us. The first shot  struck the water abreast of the forecastle on the starboard side,  about thirty feet off. The second dropped just under the bridge;  third, abreast of No. 5 hatch, quite close alongside; fourth, under  the stern, sending up a volume of water forty feet high; fifth and  sixth and last shells all fell short. The firing then ceased, and the  submarine was soon left far astern.    Marconi distress signals were sent out at once. We were thirty-seven  miles south of Queenstown. I got a reply that assistance would be with  us in an hour, but it was four hours before the small armored yacht  Jennette appeared. I account for the torpedo missing the ship to their  misjudging the speed, allowing fourteen knots instead of sixteen,  which we were doing at the time. The torpedo passed only ten feet  clear.    It was an ideal day for torpedo attack--light wind, slight ripple,  clear weather. The periscope could only have been a few inches above  water, for a very strict lookout was being kept at the time by chief  and third officers and myself and four lookout men. However, we failed  to see her before she fired the torpedo.    Not the least warning was given, and most or nearly all the passengers  were asleep at the time. It was almost another case of brutal murder.    We had twenty-one American passengers on board.    _A Washington dispatch of July 20 to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _announced:_    The President and the Cabinet decided today to have an investigation  made in the case of the British steamer Orduna, which was attacked by  a German submarine on July 9 while on her way from Liverpool to New  York. This action was taken following the receipt of a statement from  W.O. Thompson, counsel of the Federal Industrial Commission, who was a  passenger on the ship.    Mr. Thompson did not see any torpedo fired at the Orduna by the German  submarine, and was unable to give first-hand testimony that the Orduna  had been fired on without notice. It was determined, however, that the  report of Mr. Thompson justified the Government in making an  investigation.    Accordingly, Secretary Lansing wrote a letter to Secretary McAdoo,  requesting that his department undertake the investigation, which will  probably be intrusted to the Collector of Customs at New York.    At the State Department it was said that the attention of the German  Government had not been called to the charge that the Orduna was fired  on by a German submarine without warning. Any action of that sort, if  taken, will follow the investigation which is now ordered.      NEBRASKAN'S CASE    _Ambassador Gerard on July 15 formally transmitted to Washington  Germany's admission of liability and expression of regret for the  attack by a German submarine on the American steamer Nebraskan._    _Secretary Lansing's announcement of the German memorandum follows:_    Ambassador Gerard has telegraphed to the Department of State the  following memorandum from the German Foreign Office relative to the  damaging of the American steamer Nebraskan by a German submarine:    \"The German Government received from newspaper reports the  intelligence that the American steamer Nebraskan had been damaged by a  mine or torpedo on the southwest coast of Ireland. It therefore  started a thorough investigation of the case without delay, and from  the result of the investigation it has become convinced that the  damage to the Nebraskan was caused by an attack by a submarine.    \"On the evening of May 25 last the submarine met a steamer bound  westward without a flag and no neutral markings on her freeboard,  about 65 nautical miles west of Fastnet Rock. No appliance of any kind  for the illumination of the flag or markings was to be seen. In the  twilight, which had already set in, the name of the steamer was not  visible from the submarine. Since the commander of the submarine was  obliged to assume from his wide experience in the area of maritime war  that only English steamers, and no neutral steamers, traversed the war  area without flag and markings, he attacked the vessel with a torpedo,  in the conviction that he had an enemy vessel before him.
