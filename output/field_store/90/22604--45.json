We  pass the Balearic Isles, and at the distance they much resemble other  islands.    Before lunch we saw an extraordinary marine effect. Along the coast the  blue sea appeared to be covered with a veil or mist of grass green  colour, the green of a duck pond; beyond it the coast was distinct,  distant I should say about eighteen miles. We could see upper-top-sails  and the peaks of lateen sails beyond the flat bank of green, which  seemed to begin a few miles from the shore and spread over the sea's  surface several miles west and east. What made me think it was an effect  of colour above water, not in it, was that with glasses I could  distinctly see the blue backs of the swell coming through it. No one I  have met has ever seen the like, but one of the officers was asked what  it was, and he said \"Water.\"    In the afternoon we had two interesting shows on board. A bell rang, and  a waiter who was bringing us tea turned tail and fled--it was a fire  alarm! It was pretty the way every man in the ship's company jumped to  fire-stations; hose pipes were down and connected, and pumps manned very  quickly, and bar a little talk amongst the lascars, which was  immediately stopped, everything was done in silence--bravo, British  discipline! All the iron doors were shut and bolted, the inspection  followed, and that done, away went everyone, quickly and silently, to  boat-stations. All this rehearsal only took about half-an-hour or less,  then the tea came.    Another entertainment followed--a dummy dinner. Fifty waiters, all young  men, about half white and half Indian, took their posts at the tables up  the side of the saloon and down the middle. A tap on a gong and away  they all streamed to the entrances to the saloon, to port and starboard  service tables at the kitchen, where they pretended to get courses of  dinner, and then went and stood at their tables whilst the two pursers  and head steward went round the whole of them, patiently asking each  separately his duties: \"What have you to do?\" and each man answered as  well as he could, and corrections were made. This inspection took fully  an hour, then they went through the coffee, cream, and sugar and tea  drill. All this dinner and fire drill is very thorough, I must admit,  and the management of a big crowd of people on a ship begins to impress  me--but the tea--is horrid!    [Illustration]    We are now going north-east towards Marseilles. The sun shines, and it  blows a gentle half gale. The sea is blue where it isn't white, and the  wind is strong enough to keep us lying steadily over to starboard decks  of course all wet, with rainbows at the bow, and bursting spray over all  occasionally--people rather subdued, only a small muster at breakfast.    Place aux dames! I forgot to mention that a very beautiful French lady  came on board at Gibraltar; she looked like one of Van Beers' pictures  as she came down the quay steps in a most exquisite dress, dreamlike  petticoats, and open-work stockings on Diana's extremities, and she had  a little parasol, and held her skirts high--a Frenchwoman hates mud--and  the rain poured, in sheets! She gave a brave farewell to her friends and  fiance, and came on board with an air, notwithstanding the drenching  rain. She was beautiful--hair like night, eyes brown, and features most  perfectly Greek, and white as marble with a rose reflected on it! A  doctor beside me whispered \"anaemic,\" the red-haired ass! She leaves us  at Marseilles, and will never travel by sea again. G. befriended her and  interpreted for her; she was so helpless and alone in a cabin meant for  three, with a pile of boxes miles bigger than the regulation size. With  feminine courage she fought sea-sickness, fainted in the barber's chair,  but appeared at dinner in another most exquisite toilet, and then--even  in the paroxysm of sickness, preserved perfect grace of movement of hand  and eye and draperies! What heroic courage! But enough of the tea rose  in our bean field; let us get to more material things, and to  Marseilles, and the coals rattling down the iron shoot beneath our heads  as we try to sleep in air thick with coal dust.    [Illustration]    This morning the racket is like nothing else in the world. It is a  combination of the babel of the East and West, of Europe and Africa.  There are four groups of musicians alongside, harpists, singers and  fiddlers, all within the ship's length on the quay, and others in boats  alongside.    We have two gangways reaching to the wharf, where are hundreds of  porters, ship waiters and stewards bringing vegetables on board, and  ships officers and hundreds of newly arrived passengers, all talking  more or less over the music, and passing to and fro across the gangways  in the sun. The ship feels too full to move in now. The new arrivals  look a little pale and tired after their overland journey by Paris, but  we weather-worn people with The Bay behind us, enjoy the whole scene  with the calm of experienced mariners! Behind the sunlit groups of  passengers with their baggage, the dock labourers in the sheds pile  grain sacks on to waggons, and strings of stout horses stand resting  beside them. On the edge of the quay are flower girls in black, selling  big bunches of violets, and a Strong-man in pink tights and sky-blue  knickerbockers--a festive piece of colour taken with his two white  chairs and bright carpet. He plays with silver balls and does balancing  feats with his little girl, and puts his arms round her and strokes her  hair after each turn, in a delicate appeal to the sympathies of  passengers who lean over the rail and take it all in somewhat sleepily.    ... The post has brought me an Orient-Pacific guide-book which I wish I  had had coming down channel and along the Portuguese coast. I would  recommend it to anyone going this journey. It has a most interesting  collection of facts both about sea and land on the route.    ... We met the beautiful French lady again last night at the Hotel de  Louvre, where everyone meets everyone else up town. I think she is  Gascon, and the very opposite of the fair Saxon type we ought to admire  at home. You hardly expect a perfectly beautiful woman to talk well, but  this perfection could both talk and dress; her personality was not \"sunk  in her hat.\" She knew Scottish history, all about the good Lord James,  and about Mary Stuart, and what pleased us greatly was that she told us  words and hummed the airs of children's songs reputed to have been  written by Queen Mary, and which she said are sung to-day by French  children. The Hotel de Louvre soon filled, so we got away from the crowd  in a victoria and drove along the town to a cafe for supper, and it was  cold and dark too!    The cafe, Basso and Bregaillon, has a \"vue splendide\" (in the daytime),  so the bill says. What you see at night is a well lit quay with the cafe  lights shining out across the dark water in the dock on to some white  steam yachts. After getting rid of a uniformed interpreter, whose one  idea was to give us an \"Engleesh dinner, very good, very sheep,\" we made  up our own order. Of course bouillabaisse et soupe de poissons was the  first item. I am not sure how to eat this, with a spoon or fork--two  dishes are set down at once, one with half an inch of saffron-coloured  soup, made of, I think, shell-fish, and with great slices of bread in  it--certainly a spoon is not very suitable; the other dish has a perfect  aquarium of little fish and bits of bigger fish beautifully arranged in  a pyramid with similar soup round it--there are bits of red mullet,  crab, green fish, and white fish, and all sorts of odds and ends. Why do  we not make dishes like this at home? I get just such oddities any time  I lift my trammel net, but they are thrown away as \"trash.\" But the  French are artists in every line of life, in cooking, in dress, and I  believe they put art into the way they heave the coal on board. We feel  much inclined to stay here a little and see more of these Southern  French. I love their jolly abandon of manner, their kindness and  \"honesty,\" and their gasconade. So here's to you Cyrano and Daudet,  D'Artagnan and Tartarin, not forgetting M. le President.    Who do you think sat beside us within arm's length but Rejane! There  were only six or seven people in the cafe and none of them were aware of  the presence of their distinguished compatriot till we whispered her  name to the waiter, and he whispered it to them and their eyes opened! I  came to G.'s side of the table so that I might see the great actress in  mufti, and I would have liked to have made a sketch of her as she talked  to her companion, but it would have been too obvious--you know the way  she speaks, a little out of the corner of her eye and mouth, with hand  on hip. She is great! We saw her only a year ago with Coquelin in \"La  Mantansier.\"    This is the head of the Serang; I took it when he was not looking. He  runs the lascars on board; acts pretty much as bo'sun. This face is  brown and beard died rusty red, and he wears a lovely boatswains silver  whistle on a silver chain, and has an air of command and the appearance  of deepest intelligence.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER V      [Illustration]    There is a frightful crush on board. It would take years to consider all  the faces. Numbers of ladies are going out to join their husbands after  having taken their children home in spring. By the afternoon all the new  comers look much refreshed; they have washed off the travel stains of  that dusty journey across France, have tidied up, eaten, and slept a  little, and have perhaps met friends of the road. You hear,  \"Hillo--hillo--you here again! met in Simla last, didn't we--wasn't it  cold last night?\" \"By Jingo it was--rummy spell of cold--coming over all  western Europe so"]]]
