Instat vi patria Pyrrhus; nec claustra, neque ipsi    custodes sufferre valent; labat ariete crebro    ianua, et emoti procumbunt cardine postes.    Fit via vi; rumpunt aditus, primosque trucidant    immissi Danai, et late loca milite complent.    Non sic, aggeribus ruptis cum spumeus amnis    exiit, oppositasque evicit gurgite moles,    fertur in arva furens cumulo, camposque per omnis    cum stabulis armenta trahit.  Vidi ipse furentem    caede Neoptolemum geminosque in limine Atridas;    vidi Hecubam centumque nurus, Priamumque per aras    sanguine foedantem, quos ipse sacraverat, ignis.    Quinquaginta illi thalami, spes tanta nepotum,    barbarico postes auro spoliisque superbi,    procubuere; tenent Danai, qua deficit ignis.      Forsitan et Priami fuerint quae fata requiras.    Urbis uti captae casum convolsaque vidit    limina tectorum et medium in penetralibus hostem,    arma diu senior desueta trementibus aevo    circumdat nequiquam umeris, et inutile ferrum    cingitur, ac densos fertur moriturus in hostis.    Aedibus in mediis nudoque sub aetheris axe    ingens ara fuit iuxtaque veterrima laurus,    incumbens arae atque umbra complexa Penatis.    Hic Hecuba et natae nequiquam altaria circum,    praecipites atra ceu tempestate columbae,    condensae et divom amplexae simulacra sedebant.    Ipsum autem sumptis Priamum iuvenalibus armis    ut vidit, 'Quae mens tam dira, miserrime coniunx,    impulit his cingi telis?  Aut quo ruis?' inquit;    'Non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis    tempus eget, non, si ipse meus nunc adforet Hector.    Huc tandem concede; haec ara tuebitur omnis,    aut moriere simul.'  Sic ore effata recepit    ad sese et sacra longaevum in sede locavit.      Ecce autem elapsus Pyrrhi de caede Polites,    unus natorum Priami, per tela, per hostis    porticibus longis fugit, et vacua atria lustrat    saucius:  illum ardens infesto volnere Pyrrhus    insequitur, iam iamque manu tenet et premit hasta.    Ut tandem ante oculos evasit et ora parentum,    concidit, ac multo vitam cum sanguine fudit.    Hic Priamus, quamquam in media iam morte tenetur,    non tamen abstinuit, nec voci iraeque pepercit:    'At tibi pro scelere,' exclamat, 'pro talibus ausis,    di, si qua est caelo pietas, quae talia curet,    persolvant grates dignas et praemia reddant    debita, qui nati coram me cernere letum    fecisti et patrios foedasti funere voltus.    At non ille, satum quo te mentiris, Achilles    talis in hoste fuit Priamo; sed iura fidemque    supplicis erubuit, corpusque exsangue sepulchro    reddidit Hectoreum, meque in mea regna remisit.'      Sic fatus senior, telumque imbelle sine ictu    coniecit, rauco quod protinus aere repulsum    e summo clipei nequiquam umbone pependit.    Cui Pyrrhus:  'Referes ergo haec et nuntius ibis    Pelidae genitori; illi mea tristia facta    degeneremque Neoptolemum narrare memento.    Nunc morere.'  Hoc dicens altaria ad ipsa trementem    traxit et in multo lapsantem sanguine nati,    implicuitque comam laeva, dextraque coruscum    extulit, ac lateri capulo tenus abdidit ensem.    Haec finis Priami fatorum; hic exitus illum    sorte tulit, Troiam incensam et prolapsa videntem    Pergama, tot quondam populis terrisque superbum    regnatorem Asiae.  Iacet ingens litore truncus,    avolsumque umeris caput, et sine nomine corpus.      At me tum primum saevus circumstetit horror    Obstipui; subiit cari genitoris imago,    ut regem aequaevum crudeli volnere vidi    vitam exhalantem; subiit deserta Creusa,    et direpta domus, et parvi casus Iuli.    Respicio, et quae sit me circum copia lustro.    Deseruere omnes defessi, et corpora saltu    ad terram misere aut ignibus aegra dedere.      [Iamque adeo super unus eram, cum limina Vestae    servantem et tacitam secreta in sede latentem    Tyndarida aspicio:  dant clara incendia lucem    erranti passimque oculos per cuncta ferenti.    Illa sibi infestos eversa ob Pergama Teucros    et poenas Danaum et deserti coniugis iras    praemetuens, Troiae et patriae communis Erinys,    abdiderat sese atque aris invisa sedebat.    Exarsere ignes animo; subit ira cadentem    ulcisci patriam et sceleratas sumere poenas.    'Scilicet haec Spartam incolumis patriasque Mycenas    aspiciet, partoque ibit regina triumpho,    coniugiumque, domumque, patres, natosque videbit,    Iliadum turba et Phrygiis comitata ministris?    Occiderit ferro Priamus, Troia arserit igni?    Dardanium totiens sudarit sanguine litus?    Non ita:  namque etsi nullum memorabile nomen    feminea in poena est, nec habet victoria laudem,    extinxisse nefas tamen et sumpsisse merentis    laudabor poenas, animumque explesse iuvabit    ultricis flammae, et cineres satiasse meorum.'      Talia iactabam, et furiata mente ferebar :]    cum mihi se, non ante oculis tam clara, videndam    obtulit et pura per noctem in luce refulsit    alma parens, confessa deam, qualisque videri    caelicolis et quanta solet, dextraque prehensum    continuit, roseoque haec insuper addidit ore:    'Nate, quis indomitas tantus dolor excitat iras?    Quid furis, aut quonam nostri tibi cura recessit?    Non prius aspicies, ubi fessum aetate parentem    liqueris Anchisen; superet coniunxne Creusa,    Ascaniusque puer?  Quos omnes undique Graiae    circum errant acies, et, ni mea cura resistat,    iam flammae tulerint inimicus et hauserit ensis.    Non tibi Tyndaridis facies invisa Lacaenae    culpatusve Paris:  divom inclementia, divom,    has evertit opes sternitque a culmine Troiam.    Aspice---namque omnem, quae nunc obducta tuenti    mortalis hebetat visus tibi et umida circum    caligat, nubem eripiam; tu ne qua parentis    iussa time, neu praeceptis parere recusa:---    hic, ubi disiectas moles avolsaque saxis    saxa vides mixtoque undantem pulvere fumum.    Neptunus muros magnoque emota tridenti    fundamenta quatit, totamque a sedibus urbem    eruit; hic Iuno Scaeas saevissima portas    prima tenet, sociumque furens a navibus agmen    ferro accincta vocat.    Iam summas arces Tritonia, respice, Pallas    insedit, nimbo effulgens et Gorgone saeva.    Ipse pater Danais animos viresque secundas    sufficit, ipse deos in Dardana suscitat arma.    Eripe, nate, fugam, finemque impone labori.    Nusquam abero, et tutum patrio te limine sistam.'    Dixerat, et spissis noctis se condidit umbris.    Adparent dirae facies inimicaque Troiae    numina magna deum.      Tum vero omne mihi visum considere in ignis    Ilium et ex imo verti Neptunia Troia;    ac veluti summis antiquam in montibus ornum    cum ferro accisam crebrisque bipennibus instant    eruere agricolae certatim,---illa usque minatur    et tremefacta comam concusso vertice nutat,    volneribus donec paulatim evicta, supremum    congemuit, traxitque iugis avolsa ruinam.    Descendo, ac ducente deo flammam inter et hostis    expedior; dant tela locum, flammaeque recedunt.      Atque ubi iam patriae perventum ad limina sedis    antiquasque domos, genitor, quem tollere in altos    optabam primum montis primumque petebam,    abnegat excisa vitam producere Troia    exsiliumque pati.  'Vos O, quibus integer aevi    sanguis,' ait 'solidaeque suo stant robore vires,    vos agitate fugam:    me si caelicolae voluissent ducere vitam,    has mihi servassent sedes.  Satis una superque    vidimus exscidia et captae superavimus urbi.    Sic O, sic positum adfati discedite corpus.    Ipse manu mortem inveniam; miserebitur hostis    exuviasque petet; facilis iactura sepulcri.    Iam pridem invisus divis et inutilis annos    demoror, ex quo me divom pater atque hominum rex    fulminis adflavit ventis et contigit igni.'      Talia perstabat memorans, fixusque manebat.    Nos contra effusi lacrimis, coniunxque Creusa    Ascaniusque omnisque domus, ne vertere secum    cuncta pater fatoque urguenti incumbere vellet.    Abnegat, inceptoque et sedibus haeret in isdem.    Rursus in arma feror, mortemque miserrimus opto:    nam quod consilium aut quae iam fortuna dabatur?    'Mene efferre pedem, genitor, te posse relicto    sperasti, tantumque nefas patrio excidit ore?    Si nihil ex tanta Superis placet urbe relinqui,    et sedet hoc animo, perituraeque addere Troiae    teque tuosque iuvat, patet isti ianua leto,    iamque aderit multo Priami de sanguine Pyrrhus,    natum ante ora patris, patrem qui obtruncat ad aras.    Hoc erat, alma parens, quod me per tela, per ignis    eripis, ut mediis hostem in penetralibus, utque    Ascanium patremque meum iuxtaque Creusam    alterum in alterius mactatos sanguine cernam?    Arma, viri, ferte arma; vocat lux ultima victos.    Reddite me Danais; sinite instaurata revisam    proelia:  Numquam omnes hodie moriemur inulti.'      Hinc ferro accingor rursus clipeoque sinistram    insertabam aptans, meque extra tecta ferebam.    Ecce autem complexa pedes in limine coniunx    haerebat, parvumque patri tendebat Iulum:    'Si periturus abis, et nos rape in omnia tecum;    sin aliquam expertus sumptis spem ponis in armis,    hanc primum tutare domum.  Cui parvus Iulus,    cui pater et coniunx quondam tua dicta relinquor?'      Talia vociferans gemitu tectum omne replebat,    cum subitum dictuque oritur mirabile monstrum.    Namque manus inter maestorumque ora parentum    ecce levis summo de vertice visus Iuli    fundere lumen apex, tactuque innoxia mollis    lambere flamma comas et circum tempora pasci.    Nos pavidi trepidare metu, crinemque flagrantem    excutere et sanctos restinguere fontibus ignis.    At pater Anchises oculos ad sidera laetus    extulit, et caelo palmas cum voce tetendit:      'Iuppiter omnipotens, precibus si flecteris ullis,    aspice nos; hoc tantum, et, si pietate meremur,    da deinde auxilium, pater, atque haec omina firma.'    Vix ea fatus erat senior, subitoque fragore    intonuit laevum, et de caelo lapsa per umbras    stella facem ducens multa cum luce cucurrit.    Illam, summa super labentem culmina "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22700"],[0,"Brittany & Its Byways (#7)"],[1,"of these dogs prowling between St.  Malo and St. Servan; his sword was useless as defence, and, exhausted, in  despair he threw himself into the sea, but here he was followed by the  dogs and torn to pieces. A few days after they were all destroyed by the  municipality, and the custom of keeping them has been since discontinued.  In an old map of St. Malo, or \"Saint Malo de l'isle,\" as it was then  styled, preserved in the Imperial Library at Paris, is laid down, near the  \"Sillon\" a little sentry-box marked, \"Corps-de-garde de nuit pour les  chiens,\" and again, near the \"Tour de la grande Porte,\" is the \"Pont aux  chiens.\" The date of the map is 1662. The arms of St. Malo till the  seventeenth century were, on a field argent, a mastiff gules.    The castle dates principally from the Queen-Duchess Anne, and one of its  massive towers, the \"Qui qu'en grogne\" is a memorial of her dauntless  spirit. Twice crowned Queen of France, she was the only one of her line  worthy of the ducal crown. The Bishop of St. Malo was temporal lord of the  town, and maintained he held it direct from the Pope, as a fief of the  Church, because it was built upon land where a convent formerly stood; and  consequently the Duke of Brittany had no authority over it, either  spiritual or temporal. Duke John V. began to build a castle, but the  Bishop opposed himself to its construction, and the contest lasted on  until the time of the Queen-Duchess Anne, who, in defiance of the Bishop,  and to shew that she was and always would be sovereign of St. Malo,  finished the fortress and caused the lofty inscription to be placed in  raised letters upon the great tower: \"Qui qu'en grogne, ainsi sera, c'est  mon plaisir;\"--so runs the legend, but unfortunately a similar story is  told of Louis II., Duke of Bourbon.    On the opposite side of the mouth of the Rance is Dinard, lately become a  favourite watering-place; it has good sands, and houses and villas are  rapidly rising up in every direction, and covering its granite hills.    The prettiest route to Dinan is by the little steamer which ascends the  Rance, a lovely voyage, occupying about two hours. The banks one mixture  of rocks, valleys, and verdure; the river now expanding into the width of  a lake, now narrowing between its forest-clothed sides. After passing  through a lock, and, winding our way through a narrow pass of rocky crags,  we reached the bridge of Dinan; above us, the gigantic granite viaduct  stretched across the valley, the town, with its feudal walls and castle,  perched on its rocky heights over the river.    In the Grande Place is a miserable statue of Du Guesclin, who looks more  like a wandering minstrel than the hero of Brittany and Constable of  France. His life forms quite an historic romance. His future greatness was  foretold by a prophetess; his wife, the Lady Tiphaine, was herself a  fairy; his battles resemble those of the giants of old. Du Guesclin was  born at Broons, and was the eldest of ten children and of great trouble to  his parents. One day his mother dreamt she was in possession of a casket,  containing portraits of herself and her lord, and on one side were set  nine precious stones of lustrous beauty encircling one rough unpolished  pebble. In her dream she carried the casket to a lapidary, and asked him  to take out the rough stone as unworthy of such goodly company; but he  advised her to allow it to remain, and subsequently it shone forth more  brilliantly than the precious gems with which it was surrounded. The after  superiority of Bertrand over the other nine children explained the dream.    It was in this \"Place,\" where his statue now stands, the celebrated duel  took place between Du Guesclin and an English knight, called by the Breton  chroniclers Thomas of Cantorbery. Dinan was at that time closely besieged  by the Duke of Lancaster (1359), with the young Count de Montfort, and  defended by Du Guesclin. A truce of forty days had been agreed upon,  before the expiration of which Oliver, brother of Du Guesclin, rode out  unarmed beyond the city walls, and was made prisoner by Thomas of  Cantorbery, who demanded a ransom of 1000 florins. On this news reaching  Du Guesclin, he immediately repaired to the English camp, where he found  the Duke of Lancaster playing chess with Sir John Chandos. They received  him most cordially, and agreed that the dispute should be settled by a  combat within the walls, the Duke of Lancaster consenting to preside.  Victory declared in favour of Du Guesclin, who would have cut off the head  of his adversary, had not the Duke of Lancaster interceded for his life.  Cantorbery was dragged upon a hurdle out of the lists, and condemned to  pay 1000 florins to Oliver; his horse and armour were given to Bertrand,  and the felon knight expelled the English army.    We drove to see the Castle of Montafilant, one of the apanages of the  Rohan family, which passed with many others to the unfortunate Gilles de  Bretagne, by his marriage with the heiress Francoise de Dinan. The castle  is approached by a steep winding path, leading to the plateau upon which  it stands. Before the use of firearms, its position rendered it  impregnable. Of its seven towers, two only remain.    The story of Gilles de Bretagne forms the subject of a romance by the  Vicomte Walsh. Though his conduct was not free from blame, his long  captivity and tragic end have rendered this unfortunate prince an object  of pity to posterity. Third son of Duke John V., he was reared with Henry  VI. of England, and personally attached to the English; but he never was  in league with England against his own country, and his uncle the  Constable Richemont regarded him as the honour and hope of his house. His  wife Francoise was the most beautiful and accomplished woman of her time,  the \"perle de noblesse, de gentilesse, et de savoir;\" and moreover  possessed of the rich inheritance of her uncle Bertrand de Dinan, of the  Montafilant branch. She had been betrothed from her infancy to the Sire de  Gavre, son of Guy, Comte de Laval; but her father died when she was only  eight years old, and Gilles de Bretagne carried her off by force.  Dissatisfied with his paternal inheritance, the lordship of Champtoce, he  retired to Guildo, one of the chateaux of Francoise's dower, where he  passed his time in company with his English archers. His withdrawal from  court was represented to Duke Francis as the beginning of a revolt, by  Arthur de Montauban, his bitterest enemy and a great favourite of the  Duke. Gilles neglected his young wife, and she is reported, in an  unguarded moment, to have said to Montauban, she would marry him \"if her  husband were to die.\" Duke Francis was determined to get rid of his  brother, and Charles VII. was persuaded to assist him in his vile design.  The King arrested Gilles on the charge of high treason, as being in  correspondence with the English; and, in proof of the charge, his enemies  produced forged letters from the King of England compromising the loyalty  of Gilles. Charles gave him over to his brother for punishment. In vain  were Gilles's supplications to the Duke, or the entreaties of the  Constable, who went to Dinan and knelt to Francis to beg for the pardon of  his brother. Equally fruitless his being acquitted at Redon, from there  being no proof of his guilt. The unfortunate Gilles was dragged from  prison to prison, and consigned to keepers destitute of every feeling of  humanity.  Montauban, an Italian by descent (his mother was a Visconti),  sent for poison from Lombardy, and administered in his soup a strong dose,  which the good constitution of Gilles enabled him to resist. Starvation  was then tried, and the wretched Gilles would stand at his prison window,  calling on the passers by to give him bread: \"Du pain, du pain pour  l'amour de Dieu,\" but no one ventured to relieve him. At last, a poor  woman dared to give him food, and placed a loaf on the edge of his grated  window, continuing for six months to share with him in secret her scanty  meal of black bread. Seeing that he could hold out no longer and that his  death was determined upon, Gilles begged the woman would fetch him a  minister of religion, that he might confess before he died. By stealth she  brought him a Cordelier monk, who confessed him across the bars of his  prison, and Gilles adjured him to seek his brother and acquaint him with  his pitiable condition. The monk started on his errand, but in the mean  time the gaolers of Gilles determined on putting an end to his life. They  twisted a cloth round his neck, and smothered him between two mattresses  while he slept. The monks of Bosquen carried his body to their abbey for  interment, and the wooden effigy that was placed over his grave is still  preserved in the Museum at St. Brieuc. The monk who had received Gilles's  confession went in quest of Duke Francis, who, on hearing of his brother's  death when at Avranches, had left for Saint Michel. The monk met him on  the Greve, and cited him in the name of his brother \"de la part du Messire  Gilles\" to appear within fifty days at the tribunal of Heaven to answer  for his murder. The menace was realised. Duke Francis died within the  appointed time, struck with remorse, and terrified at the summons of the  Cordelier. The monk was never seen again. On the death of Gilles, the Duke  of Brittany himself wished to marry Francoise, but she would not listen to  his proposals; and at last was obliged, in order to recover her liberty,  to marry the aged Comte de Laval, father of her betrothed, with whom she  lived peacefully thirty years, and had three sons. Duke Francis II.  appointed her to the charge of rearing his daughter Anne.    Arthur Montauban turned monk to avoid the vengeance of Duke Peter, brother  of Gilles, and eventually became Archbishop of Bordeaux. The Pope gave him  the Abbey of Redon, but popular indignation prevented him from accepting"]]]
