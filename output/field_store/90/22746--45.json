Hence the over-pressure in schools, and hence, also, the urgent  necessity of totally revising both the subjects and the methods of  teaching, according to the new wants and to the examples already given  here and there, by separate schools and separate teachers.    It is evident that the years of childhood ought not to be spent so  uselessly as they are now. German teachers have shown how the very plays  of children can be made instrumental in conveying to the childish mind  some concrete knowledge in both geometry and mathematics. The children  who have made the squares of the theorem of Pythagoras out of pieces of  colored cardboard, will not look at the theorem, when it comes in  geometry, as on a mere instrument of torture devised by the teachers;  and the less so if they apply it as the carpenters do. Complicated  problems of arithmetic, which so much harassed us in our boyhood, are  easily solved by children seven and eight years old if they are put in  the shape of interesting puzzles. And if the _Kindergarten_--German  teachers often make of it a kind of barrack in which each movement of  the child is regulated beforehand--has often become a small prison for  the little ones, the idea which presided at its foundation is  nevertheless true. In fact, it is almost impossible to imagine, without  having tried it, how many sound notions of nature, habits of  classification, and taste for natural sciences can be conveyed to the  children's minds; and, if a series of concentric courses adapted to the  various phases of development of the human being were generally accepted  in education, the first series in all sciences, save sociology, could be  taught before the age of ten or twelve, so as to give a general idea of  the universe, the earth and its inhabitants, the chief physical,  chemical, zoological, and botanical phenomena, leaving the discovery of  the _laws_ of those phenomena to the next series of deeper and more  specialised studies. On the other side, we all know how children like to  make toys themselves, how they gladly imitate the work of full-grown  people if they see them at work in the workshop or the building-yard.  But the parents either stupidly paralyze that passion, or do not know  how to utilize it. Most of them despise manual work and prefer sending  their children to the study of Roman history, or of Franklin's teachings  about saving money, to seeing them at a work which is good for the  \"lower classes only.\" They thus do their best to render subsequent  learning the more difficult.        *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *    The so-called division of labor has grown under a system which condemned  the masses to toil all the day long, and all the life long, at the same  wearisome kind of labor. But if we take into account how few are the  real producers of wealth in our present society, and how squandered is  their labor, we must recognize that Franklin was right in saying that to  work five hours a day would generally do for supplying each member of a  civilized nation with the comfort now accessible for the few only,  provided everybody took his due share in production. But we have made  some progress since Franklin's times. More than one-half of the working  day would thus remain to every one for the pursuit of art, science, or  any hobby he might prefer; and his work in those fields would be the  more profitable if he spent the other half of the day in productive  work--if art and science were followed from mere inclination, not for  mercantile purposes. Moreover, a community organized on the principles  of all being workers would be rich enough to conclude that every man and  woman, after having reached a certain age--say of forty or more--ought  to be relieved from the moral obligation of taking a direct part in the  performance of the necessary manual work, so as to be able entirely to  devote himself or herself to whatever he or she chooses in the domain of  art, or science, or any kind of work. Free pursuit in new branches of  art and knowledge, free creation, and free development thus might be  fully guaranteed. And such a community would not know misery amidst  wealth. It would not know the duality of conscience which permeates our  life and stifles every noble effort. It would freely take its flight  towards the highest regions of progress compatible with human nature.    FOOTNOTE:    [1] What this school is now, I don't know.

[Illustration]          MOTHERHOOD AND MARRIAGE    By HENRIETTE FUERTH.    (_Translated from the German for_ MOTHER EARTH by ANNY MALI HICKS.)          Knowledge becomes understanding only when its scope includes the      origin, the development and the conclusion of things.--Bachofen,      \"Right to Motherhood.\"    \"THE future will endeavor to extend its power through its own ideas of  facts and appearances, however unfamiliar these may seem, rather than to  be influenced by a past and submerged civilization with a spirit far  removed from its own.\"    There could hardly be a more appropriate introduction to our remarks on  motherhood and marriage than these words of Bachofen's, for there are  few human relations whose traditional stages, taking through outside  causes and effects an established form, have become eternal law and  sacrament, as is the case in the realm of sex relations. Motherhood and  marriage! For most people these two conceptions are inseparably bound  together, or, rather, are in ratio connected as their ideas of morality  and religion are synonymous. Marriage in the Romish Church is a  religious sacrament, and in the collective Christian and Jewish worlds  the only sex relation acknowledged as customary and possible, is the one  based on a monogamous union. To work out logically from this  standpoint, the only condition of motherhood which is socially  justified, is that one which is the result of marital relations. In  consequence motherhood without the consent of the State or the benefit  of the clergy is just as logically condemned. And they who thus sit in  judgment, flatter themselves to be the prophets of an advanced and  enlightened era,--ingrafting their personal feelings and rights on the  religious and lawful order of the universe. Or, in common parlance, and  as our introduction so aptly put it, these good people wish to intend  the domination of the ideas of their own time over all the past and into  all the future. Marriage seems to them an everlasting institution, a  godly regulation, through which they can lend to their individual bias,  the dignity of that which is humanly purest and highest. Consequently it  also seems to them that the present form of marriage and its  accompanying conditions for motherhood, resting as these do on the  mutual consent of God and man, that these are to be in all eternity the  permanent form of sex relation.    But when we stop one moment only, to free ourselves from preconceived  and obsolete ideas, and look at motherhood and marriage from the calm  and unprejudiced standpoint of historical development and growth, how  differently do these in reality appear. Many advanced thinkers have done  this, and their views have here and there found adherents. Not so,  however, with the average seeker for light and truth, who if he wish to  succeed must stem the tide of prejudiced opinion.    But the day has come when, if all signs do not fail, spring is here, and  a thousand and one buds of promise are pushing toward the light, when a  wider and saner understanding of motherhood and marriage is at hand. And  it is not an untimely spring either, not one which the treacherous sun  of January calls forth only to blight with later snow and frost. No, it  is the real light and life-giving spring, which comes when the sap  begins to run, when the sun calls up smoky mists from out the brown  earth, ready to enclose the seed, which shall bring forth summer flowers  and autumn fruits.    And this same brown, misty earth, what a different aspect shall she  present to her children, for whom conditions are so changed, with truer  sex relations, encompassing the ethical and spiritual needs of the free  individual. Then only will it be _possible_ to base these needs and  demands on the surrounding world of realities filled with material and  spiritual phenomena.    But first it must be proven that the present form of marriage and its  effect on motherhood is not necessarily permanent, but, like all else,  subject to natural development and change. What indeed is the much  talked of marriage bond of to-day,--which is considered the cornerstone  of both Church and State? Is it something towards which the steps of  development in nature and history all go? No seriously minded person  could in truth make such a statement. In the plant and animal kingdoms,  whose species evoke as do those of the human race, we find no examples  of sex relations to which the term marriage would apply. And this is  also true of the historical development of man and social conditions. It  is not marriage but motherhood which has given permanence to sex  relations wherever they appear. Motherhood standing at the source of  life with its creative and ever recreative force.           \"Goddesses enthroned in solitude,       Surrounded not by time or place,       These are the mothers!       About them formed and formless,       Eternal stability and endless change       In images of all created life.\"      Thus does Goethe describe the depths of being which enclose the eternal  mystery of motherhood, leading not into known, but unknown paths."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27348"],[0,"The 2007 CIA World Factbook (#7)"],[1,"members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its  leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated to  their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly  responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will by  the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or the  leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no longer  function.    Parliamentary monarchy - a state headed by a monarch who is not  actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the  exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity);  true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head -  a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from a  legislature (parliament).    Republic - a representative democracy in which the people's elected  deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on  legislation.    Socialism - a government in which the means of planning, producing, and  distributing goods is controlled by a central government that  theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of property  and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended up being  no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite.    Sultanate - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the  supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state);  the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with  constitutionally limited authority.    Theocracy - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as the  supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by  ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government  subject to religious authority.    Totalitarian - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual to  the state by controlling not only all political and economic matters,  but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its population.

Household income or consumption by percentage share:  Data on household  income or consumption come from household surveys, the results adjusted  for household size. Nations use different standards and procedures in  collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys based on income will  normally show a more unequal distribution than surveys based on  consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with time, yet caution  is still necessary in making inter-country comparisons.    Hydrographic data codes:  see Data codes    Illicit drugs:  This entry gives information on the five categories of  illicit drugs - narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives),  hallucinogens, and cannabis. These categories include many drugs  legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally  produced and sold outside of medical channels.    Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides  hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana  (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,  Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).    Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain the  stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,  which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,  and cocoa butter.    Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.  Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and  include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,  phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone  (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,  Valmid).    Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,  emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.    Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that  results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an  individual.    Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-  awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),  mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants  (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine  analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).  Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis  sativa).    Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.    Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical depressant.  Marijuana is the dried leaf of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis  sativa).    Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax in  Southwest Asia and Africa.    Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to  opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics  include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),  codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC),  and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack),  and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or  Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and  others (Darvon, Lomotil).    Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the  opium poppy.    Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and  semisynthetic narcotics.    Poppy straw is the entire cut and dried opium poppy-plant material,  other than the seeds. Opium is extracted from poppy straw in commercial  operations that produce the drug for medical use.    Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis  that is chewed or drunk as tea.    Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a  pharmaceutical depressant.    Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and  activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines  (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), ephedrine, ecstasy (clarity, essence, doctor,  Adam), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others  (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).
