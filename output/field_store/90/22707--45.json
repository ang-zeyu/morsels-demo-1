Beowulf and Grendel    The fourteen champions of the Geats now made ready for sleep; but  while the others lay down in their armour, with weapons by their  sides, Beowulf took off his mail, unbelted his sword, unhelmed  himself, and gave his sword to a thane to bear away. For, as he said  to his men, \"I will strive against this fiend weaponless. With no  armour, since he wears none, will I wrestle with him, and try to  overcome him. I will conquer, if I win, by my hand-grip alone; and the  All-Father shall judge between us, and grant the victory to whom He  will.\"    The Geats then lay down--brave men who slept calmly, though they knew  they were risking their lives, for none of them expected to see the  light of day again, or to revisit their native land: they had heard,  too, much during the feast of the slaughter which Grendel had wrought.  So night came, the voices of men grew silent, and the darkness  shrouded all alike--calm sleepers, anxious watchers, and the deadly,  creeping foe.    When everything was still Grendel came. From the fen-fastnesses, by  marshy tracts, through mists and swamp-born fogs, the hideous monster  made his way to the house he hated so bitterly. Grendel strode fiercely  to the door of Heorot, and would fain have opened it as usual, but it  was locked and bolted. Then the fiend's wrath was roused; he grasped  the door with his mighty hands and burst it in. As he entered he seemed  to fill the hall with his monstrous shadow, and from his eyes shone a  green and uncanny light, which showed him a troop of warriors lying  asleep in their war-gear; it seemed that all slept, and the fiend did  not notice that one man half rose, leaning on his elbow and peering  keenly into the gloom. Grendel hastily put forth his terrible scaly  hand and seized one hapless sleeper. Tearing him limb from limb, so  swiftly that his cry of agony was unheard, he drank the warm blood and  devoured the flesh; then, excited by the hideous food, he reached forth  again. Great was Grendel's amazement to find that his hand was seized  in a grasp such as he had never felt before, and to know that he had  at last found an antagonist whom even he must fight warily. Beowulf  sprang from his couch as the terrible claws of the monster fell upon  him, and wrestled with Grendel in the darkness and gloom of the  unlighted hall, where the flicker of the fire had died down to a dim  glow in the dull embers. That was a dreadful struggle, as the  combatants, in deadly conflict, swayed up and down the hall,  overturning tables and benches, trampling underfoot dishes and goblets  in the darkling wrestle for life. The men of the Geats felt for their  weapons, but they could not see the combatants distinctly, though they  heard the panting and the trampling movements, and occasionally caught  a gleam from the fiend's eyes as his face was turned towards them. When  they struck their weapons glanced harmlessly off Grendel's scaly hide.  The struggle continued for some time, and the hall was an utter wreck  within, when Grendel, worsted for once, tried to break away and rush  out into the night; but Beowulf held him fast in the grip which no man  on earth could equal or endure, and the monster writhed in anguish as  he vainly strove to free himself--vainly, for Beowulf would not loose  his grip. Suddenly, with one great cry, Grendel wrenched himself free,  and staggered to the door, leaving behind a terrible blood-trail, for  his arm and shoulder were torn off and left in the victor's grasp. So  the monster fled wailing over the moors to his home in the gloomy mere,  and Beowulf sank panting on a shattered seat, scarce believing in his  victory, until his men gathered round, bringing a lighted torch, by the  flaring gleam of which the green, scaly arm of Grendel looked ghastly  and threatening. But the monster had fled, and after such a wound as  the loss of his arm and shoulder must surely die; therefore the Geats  raised a shout of triumph, and then took the hateful trophy and  fastened it high up on the roof of the hall, that all who entered might  see the token of victory and recognise that the Geat hero had performed  his boast, that he would conquer with no weapon, but by the strength of  his hands alone.    In the morning many a warrior came to Heorot to learn the events of  the night, and all saw the grisly trophy, praised Beowulf's might and  courage, and followed with eager curiosity the blood-stained track of  the fleeing demon till it came to the brink of the gloomy lake, where  it disappeared, though the waters were stained with gore, and boiled  and surged with endless commotion. There on the shore the Danes  rejoiced over the death of their enemy, and returned to Heorot  care-free and glad at heart. Meanwhile Beowulf and his Geats stayed in  Heorot, for Hrothgar had not yet come to receive an account of their  night-watch. Throughout the day there was feasting and rejoicing, with  horse-races, and wrestling, and manly contests of skill and endurance;  or the Danes collected around the bard as he chanted the glory of  Sigmund and his son Fitela. Then came King Hrothgar himself, with his  queen and her maiden train, and they paused to gaze with horror on the  dreadful trophy, and to turn with gratitude to the hero who had  delivered them from this evil spirit. Hrothgar said: \"Thanks be to the  All-Father for this happy sight! Much sorrow have I endured at the  hands of Grendel, many warriors have I lost, many uncounted years of  misery have I lived, but now my woe has an end! Now a youth has  performed, with his unaided strength, what all we could not compass  with our craft! Well might thy father, O Beowulf, rejoice in thy fame!  Well may thy mother, if she yet lives, praise the All-Father for the  noble son she bore! A son indeed shalt thou be to me in love, and  nothing thou desirest shalt thou lack, that I can give thee. Often  have I rewarded less heroic deeds with great gifts, and to thee I can  deny nothing.\"    Beowulf answered: \"We have performed our boast, O King, and have  driven away the enemy. I intended to force him down on one of the  beds, and to deprive him of his life by mere strength of my hand-grip,  but in this I did not succeed, for Grendel escaped from the hall. Yet  he left here with me his hand, his arm, and shoulder as a token of his  presence, and as the ransom with which he bought off the rest of his  loathsome body; yet none the longer will he live thereby, since he  bears with him so deadly a wound.\"    Then the hall was cleared of the traces of the conflict and hasty  preparation was made for a splendid banquet. There was joy in Heorot.  The Danes assembled once again free from fear in their splendid hall,  the walls were hung with gold-wrought embroideries and hangings of  costly stuffs, while richly chased goblets shone on the long tables,  and men's tongues waxed loud as they discussed and described the  heroic struggle of the night before. Beowulf and King Hrothgar sat on  the high seats opposite to each other, and their men, Danes and Geats,  sitting side by side, shouted and cheered and drank deeply to the fame  of Beowulf. The minstrels sang of the Fight in Finnsburg and the deeds  of Finn and Hnaef, of Hengest and Queen Hildeburh. Long was the chant,  and it roused the national pride of the Danes to hear of the victory  of their Danish forefathers over Finn of the Frisians; and merrily the  banquet went forward, gladdened still more by the presence of Queen  Wealhtheow. Now Hrothgar showed his lavish generosity and his  thankfulness by the gifts with which he loaded the Geat chief; and not  only Beowulf, but every man of the little troop. Beowulf received a  gold-embroidered banner, a magnificent sword, helmet, and corslet, a  goblet of gold, and eight fleet steeds. On the back of the best was  strapped a cunningly wrought saddle, Hrothgar's own, with gold  ornaments. When the Geat hero had thanked the king fittingly, Queen  Wealhtheow arose from her seat, and, lifting the great drinking-cup,  offered it to her lord, saying:        \"Take thou this goblet,    my lord and my ruler,      O giver of treasure,    O gold-friend of heroes,      And speak to the Geats    fair speeches of kindness,      Be mirthful and joyous,    for so should a man be!      To the Geats be gracious,    mindful of presents      Now that from far and near    thou hast firm peace!      Tidings have come to me    that thou for son wilt take      This mighty warrior    who has cleansed Heorot,      Brightest of banquet-halls!    Enjoy while thou mayest      These manifold pleasures,    and leave to thy kinsmen      Thy lands and thy lordships    when thou must journey forth      To meet thy death.\"    Turning to Beowulf, the queen said: \"Enjoy thy reward, O dear Beowulf,  while thou canst, and live noble and blessed! Keep well thy widespread  fame, and be a friend to my sons in time to come, should they ever  need a protector.\" Then she gave him two golden armlets, set with  jewels, costly rings, a corslet of chain-mail and a wonderful jewelled  collar of exquisite ancient workmanship, and, bidding them continue  their feasting, with her maidens she left the hall. The feast went on  till Hrothgar also departed to his dwelling, and left the Danes, now  secure and careless, to prepare their beds, place each warrior's  shield at the head, and go to sleep in their armour ready for an  alarm. Meanwhile Beowulf and the Geats were joyfully escorted to  another lodging, where they slept soundly without disturbance.      Grendel's Mother    In the darkness of the night an avenger came to Heorot, came in  silence and mystery as Grendel had done, with thoughts of murder and  hatred raging in her heart. Grendel had gone home to die, but his  mother, a fiend scarcely less terrible than her son, yet lived to  avenge his death. She arose from her dwelling in the gloomy lake,  followed the fen paths"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25529"],[0,"The Adventures of Danny Meadow Mouse (#7)"],[1,"laws, but he didn't  let himself think much about that, because he was so thankful to  be alive at all. So he limped around in the Old Briar-patch,  picking up seed which had fallen on the snow, and sometimes  pulling down a few of the red berries which cling all winter to  the wild rose bushes. The seeds in these were very nice indeed,  and Danny always felt especially good after a meal of them.    Danny Meadow Mouse had grown very fond of Peter Rabbit, for Peter  had been very, very good to him. Danny felt that he never, never  could repay all of Peter's kindness. It had been very good of  Peter to offer to share the Old Briar-patch with Danny because  Danny was so far from his own home that it would not be safe for  him to try to get back there. But Peter had done more than that.  He had taken care of Danny, such good care, during the first few  days after Danny's escape from Hooty the Owl. He had brought good  things to eat while Danny was too weak and sore to get things for  himself. Oh, Peter had been very good indeed to him!    But now, as Danny limped around, he was not happy. No, Sir, he  was not happy. The truth is, Danny Meadow Mouse was worried. It  was a different kind of worry from any he had known before. You  see, for the first time in his life, Danny was worrying about  someone else. He was worrying about Peter Rabbit. Peter had been  gone from the Old Briar-patch a whole night and a whole day. He  often was gone all night, but never all day too. Danny was sure  that something had happened to Peter. He thought of how he had  begged Peter not to go up to Farmer Brown's young peach orchard.  He had felt in his bones that it was not safe, that something  dreadful would happen to Peter. How Peter had laughed at him and  bravely started off! Why hadn't he come home?    As he limped around, Danny talked to himself:        \"_Why cannot people be content      With all the good things that are sent,      And mind their own affairs at home      Instead of going forth to roam?_\"    It was now the second night since Peter Rabbit had gone away.  Danny Meadow Mouse couldn't sleep at all. Round and round through  the Old Briar-patch he limped, and finally sat down at the edge  of it to wait and watch. At last, just as jolly, round, red Mr.  Sun sent his first long rays of light across the Green Meadows,  Danny saw something crawling toward the Old Briar-patch. He  rubbed his eyes and looked again. It was--no, it couldn't  be--yes, it was Peter Rabbit! But what was the matter with him?  Always before Peter had come home lipperty-lipperty-lipperty-lip,  but now he was crawling, actually crawling! Danny Meadow Mouse  didn't know what to make of it.    Nearer and nearer came Peter. Something was following him. No,  Peter was dragging something after him. At last Peter started to  crawl along one of his little private paths into the Old  Briar-patch. The thing dragging behind caught in the brambles,  and Peter fell headlong in the snow, too tired and worn out to  move. Then Danny saw what the trouble was. A wire was fast to one  of Peter's long hind legs, and to the other end of the wire was  fastened part of a stake. Peter had been caught in a snare! Danny  hurried over to Peter and tears stood in his eyes.    \"Poor Peter Rabbit! Oh, I'm so sorry, Peter!\" he whispered.                                      XVIII                Danny Meadow Mouse Returns a Kindness      There Peter Rabbit lay. He had dragged that piece of stake a long  way, a very long way, indeed. But now he could drag it no  farther, for it had caught in the bramble bushes. So Peter just  dropped on the snow and cried. Yes, Sir, he cried! You see, he  was so tired and worn out and frightened, and his leg was so  stiff and sore and hurt him so! And then it was so dreadful to  actually get home and be stopped right on your very own doorstep.  So Peter just lay there and cried. Just supposing old Granny Fox  should come poking around and find Peter caught that way! All she  would have to do would be to get hold of that hateful stake  caught in the bramble bushes and pull Peter out where she could  get him. Do you wonder that Peter cried?    By and by he became aware that someone was wiping away his tears.  It was Danny Meadow Mouse. And Danny was singing in a funny  little voice. Pretty soon Peter stopped crying and listened, and  this is what he heard:        \"_Isn't any use to cry!        Not a bit! Not a bit!      Wipe your eyes and wipe 'em dry!        Use your wit! Use your wit!      Just remember that tomorrow      Never brings a single sorrow.      Yesterday has gone forever      And tomorrow gets here never.      Chase your worries all away;      Nothing's worse than just today._\"    Peter smiled in spite of himself.    \"That's right! That's right! Smile away, Peter Rabbit. Smile  away! Your troubles, Sir, are all today. And between you and me,  I don't believe they are so bad as you think they are. Now you  lie still just where you are, while I go see what can be done.\"    With that, off whisked Danny Meadow Mouse as spry as you please,  in spite of his lame leg, and in a few minutes Peter knew by  little twitches of the wire on his leg that Danny was doing  something at the other end. He was. Danny Meadow Mouse had set  out to gnaw that piece of stake all to splinters. So there he sat  and gnawed and gnawed and gnawed. Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun  climbed higher and higher in the sky, and Danny Meadow Mouse  grew hungry, but still he kept right on gnawing at that  bothersome stake.    [Illustration: _Danny Meadow Mouse had set out to gnaw that piece  of stake all to splinters_]    By and by, happening to look across the snow-covered Green  Meadows, he saw something that made his heart jump. It was Farmer  Brown's boy coming straight over toward the dear Old Briar-patch.    Danny didn't say a word to Peter Rabbit, but gnawed faster than  ever.    Farmer Brown's boy was almost there when Danny stopped gnawing.  There was only a tiny bit of the stake left now, and Danny  hurried to tell Peter Rabbit that there was nothing to stop him  now from going to his most secret retreat in the very heart of  the Old Briar-patch. While Peter slowly dragged his way along,  Danny trotted behind to see that the wire did not catch on the  bushes.    They had safely reached Peter Rabbit's secretest retreat when  Farmer Brown's boy came up to the edge of the dear Old Briar-patch.    \"So this is where that rabbit that killed our peach tree lives!\"  said he. \"We'll try a few snares and put you out of mischief.\"    And for the rest of the afternoon Farmer Brown's boy was very  busy around the edge of the Old Briar-patch.    [Illustration]                                       XIX            Peter Rabbit and Danny Meadow Mouse Live High      Peter Rabbit sat in his secretest place in the dear Old  Briar-patch with one of his long hind legs all swelled up and  terribly sore because of the fine wire fast around it and cutting  into it. He could hear Farmer Brown's boy going around on the  edge of the dear Old Briar-patch and stopping every little while  to do something. In spite of his pain, Peter was curious.  Finally he called Danny Meadow Mouse.    \"Danny, you are small and can keep out of sight easier than I  can. Go as near as ever you dare to Farmer Brown's boy and find  out what he is doing,\" said Peter Rabbit.    So Danny Meadow Mouse crept out as near to Farmer Brown's boy as  ever he dared, and studied and studied to make out what Farmer  Brown's boy was doing. By and by he returned to Peter Rabbit.    \"I don't know what he's doing, Peter, but he's putting something  in every one of your private little paths leading into the  Briar-patch from the Green Meadows.\"    \"Ha!\" said Peter Rabbit.    \"There are little loops of that queer stuff you've got hanging to  your leg, Peter,\" continued Danny Meadow Mouse.    \"Just so!\" said Peter Rabbit.    \"And he's put cabbage leaves and pieces of apple all around,\"  said Danny.    \"We must be careful!\" said Peter Rabbit.    Peter's leg was in a very bad way, indeed, and Peter suffered a  great deal of pain. The worst of it was, he didn't know how to  get off the wire that was cutting into it so. He had tried to  cut the wire with his big teeth, but he couldn't do it. Danny  Meadow Mouse had tried and tried to gnaw the wire, but it wasn't  the least bit of use. But Danny wasn't easily discouraged, and he  kept working and working at it. Once he thought he felt it slip a  little. He said nothing, but kept right on working. Pretty soon  he was sure that it slipped. He went right on working harder than  ever. By and by he had it so loose that he slipped it right off  Peter's leg, and Peter didn't know anything about it. You see,  that cruel wire snare had been so tight that Peter didn't have  any feeling except of pain left in his leg, and so when Danny  Meadow Mouse pulled the cruel wire snare off, Peter didn't know  it until Danny held it up in front of him.    My, how thankful Peter was, and how he did thank Danny Meadow  Mouse! But Danny said that it was nothing at all, just nothing at  all, and that he owed more than that to Peter Rabbit for being so  good to him and letting him live in the dear Old Briar-patch.    It was a long time before Peter could hop as he used to, but  after the first day he managed to get around. He found that  Farmer Brown's boy had spread those miserable wire snares in  every one of his private little paths. But Peter knew what they  were now. He showed Danny Meadow Mouse how he, because he was so  small, could safely run about among the snares and steal all the  cabbage leaves and apples which Farmer Brown's boy had put there  for bait.    Danny Meadow Mouse thought this great fun and a great joke on  Farmer Brown's boy. So every day he stole the bait, and he and  Peter Rabbit lived high while Peter's leg was getting well. And  all the time Farmer Brown's boy wondered why he couldn't catch  "]]]
