A majority of the new tribunes were also  favourable to him, especially P. Sestius and T. Annius Milo; and in  spite of constant ups and downs in his feelings of confidence, he had on  the whole concluded that his recall was certain to take place. Towards  the end of November he therefore travelled back to Dyrrachium, a _libera  civitas_ in which he had many friends, and where he thought he might be  safe, and from which he could cross to Italy as soon as he heard of the  law for his recall having been passed. Here, however, he was kept  waiting through many months of anxiety. Clodius had managed to make his  recall as difficult as possible. He had, while tribune, obtained an  order from the people forbidding the consuls to bring the subject before  the senate, and Piso and Gabinius had during their year of office  pleaded that law as a bar to introducing the question.    [Sidenote: The Recall, August, B.C. 57.]    The new consuls were not, or did not consider themselves, so bound, and  Lentulus having brought the subject forward, the senate early passed a  resolution that Cicero's recall was to take precedence of all other  business. In accordance with the resolution of the senate, a law was  proposed by the consul Lentulus in the _comitia centuriata_, and  probably one by Milo to the _tributa_. But Clodius, though no longer  armed with the tribuneship, was not yet beaten. He obtained the aid of  some gladiators belonging to his brother Appius, and more than once  interrupted and dispersed an assembly of the _comitia_. In the riots  thus occasioned blood was shed on both sides, and Cicero's brother  Quintus on one occasion nearly lost his life. This was the beginning of  the series of violent contests between Clodius and Milo, only ended by  the murder of the former on the Appian road in B.C. 52. But Clodius was  a candidate for the aedileship in this year (B.C. 57), and could be  barred from that office legally by a prosecution for _vis_, of which  Milo gave notice against him. It was, perhaps, a desire to avoid this,  as much as fear of Milo's counter exhibition of violence, that at length  caused him to relax in his opposition, or at any rate to abstain from  violently interrupting the _comitia_. Accordingly, on the 4th of August,  the law proposed by both consuls, and supported by Pompey, was passed  unanimously by the centuries. Cicero, we must presume, had received  trustworthy information that this was to be the case (shewing that some  understanding had been come to with Clodius, or there would have been no  certainty of his not violently dispersing the _comitia_ again), for on  that same day he set sail from Dyrrachium and landed at Brundisium on  the 5th. His triumphant return to Rome is described in the eighty-ninth  letter of this collection. For Pompey's share in securing it he  expressed, and seems really to have felt, an exaggerated gratitude,  which still influenced him in the unhappy months of B.C. 49, when he was  hesitating as to joining him beyond seas in the civil war.    But though Clodius had somehow been prevented from hindering his recall,  he by no means relaxed his hostility. He not only tried to excite the  populace against him by arguing that the scarcity and consequent high  price of corn, from which the people were at that time suffering, was in  some way attributable to Cicero's policy, but he also opposed the  restoration of his house; and when a decree of the senate was passed in  Cicero's favour on that point, brought his armed ruffians to prevent the  workmen from going on with the rebuilding, as well as to molest Cicero  himself (vol. i., p. 195). This was followed by a determined opposition  by Milo to the holding of the elections for B.C. 56, until his  prosecution of Clodius _de vi_ should have been tried. Clodius, however,  was acquitted,[12] and, being elected aedile, immediately commenced a  counter accusation against Milo for _vis_. He impeached him before the  _comitia_ in February (B.C. 56), on which occasion Pompey spoke in  Milo's defence in the midst of a storm of interruptions got up by the  friends of Clodius (vol. i., pp. 214, 217). Milo was also acquitted, and  the rest of Clodius's aedileship seems to have passed without farther  acts of open violence.    [Sidenote: Cicero and the Triumvirs.]    But Cicero had now other causes of anxiety. He had spoken in favour of  the commission offered to Pompey in B.C. 57 for superintending the  corn-supply of Rome (_cura annonae_). Pompey was to have fifteen legates,  a good supply of ships and men, and considerable powers in all  corn-growing countries in the Mediterranean. Cicero supported this,  partly from gratitude to Pompey, but partly also from a wish to promote  his power and influence against the ever-increasing influence and fame  of Caesar. He secretly hoped that a jealousy might grow up between them;  that Pompey would be drawn closer to the Optimates; and that the union  of the triumvirate might be gradually weakened and finally disappear.  Pompey was thoroughly offended and alarmed by the insults offered him by  the Clodian mob, and by Clodius's own denunciations of him; and if he  could be convinced that these were suggested or approved by Caesar or  Crassus, it would go far to withdraw him from friendship with either of  them. With Crassus, indeed, he had never been on cordial terms: it was  only Caesar's influence that had caused him to form any union with him.  Caesar, on the other hand, was likely to be uneasy at the great powers  which the _cura annonae_ put into Pompey's hands; and at the possible  suggestion of offering him the dictatorship, if the Clodian riots became  quite intolerable. On the whole, Cicero thought that he saw the element  of a very pretty quarrel, from which he hoped that the result might be  \"liberty\"--the orderly working of the constitution, that is, without the  irregular supremacy of anyone, at any rate of anyone of the popular  party. He had, however, a delicate part to play. He did not wish or dare  to break openly with Caesar, or to speak too openly to Pompey; and he was  conscious that the intemperance, folly, or indifference of many of the  Optimates made it difficult to reckon on their support, and made that  support a very questionable benefit if accorded. But though his letters  of this period are full of expressions indicating doubt of Pompey and  irritation with him, yet he seems still to have spoken of him with  warmth on public occasions, while he avoided mentioning Caesar, or spoke  of him only in cold terms.    [Sidenote: Renewal of the Triumvirate at Luca, April, B.C. 56, and  Cicero's change of policy.]    [Sidenote: Quintus Cicero in Gaul.]    The hope, however, of detaching Pompey from Caesar was dashed by the  meeting at Luca in April, B.C. 56, at which a fresh arrangement was made  for the mutual advantage of the triumvirs. Caesar got the promise of the  introduction of a law giving him an additional five years of command in  Gaul, with special privileges as to his candidature for the consulship  of B.C. 48; while Pompey and Crassus bargained for a second consulship  in B.C. 55, and the reversion of the Spains (to be held as a single  province) and Syria respectively, each for five years. The care taken  that none of the three should have _imperium_ overlapping that of the  others was indeed a sign of mutual distrust and jealousy. But the  bargain was made with sufficient approval of the members of the party  crowding Luca to secure its being carried out by the _comitia_. The  union seemed stronger than ever; and Cicero at length resolved on a  great change of attitude. Opposition to the triumvirs had been  abandoned, he saw, by the very party for whom he had been incurring the  enmity of Pompey and Caesar. Why should he hold out any longer? \"Since  those who have no power,\" he writes to Atticus in April, \"refuse me  their affection, let me take care to secure the affection of those who  have power. You will say, 'I could have wished that you had done so  before.' I know you did wish it, and that I have made a real ass of  myself.\"[13] This is the first indication in the letters of the change.  But it was soon to be publicly avowed. The opposition to the consulship  of Pompey and Crassus was so violent that no election took place during  B.C. 56, and they were only elected under the presidency of _interreges_  at the beginning of February, B.C. 55. But by the _lex Sempronia_ the  senate was bound to name the consular provinces--_i.e._, the provinces  to be governed by the incoming consuls after their year of  office--before the elections, and in his speech on the subject (_de  Provinciis Consularibus_), delivered apparently in July, B.C. 56,  Cicero, while urging that Piso and Gabinius should have successors  appointed to them in Macedonia and Syria, took occasion to announce and  defend his own reconciliation with Caesar, and to support his continuance  in the governorship of Gaul. Shortly afterwards, when defending the  citizenship of L. Cornelius Balbus, he delivered a glowing panegyric on  Pompey's character and services to the state. This was followed by a  complete abstention from any farther opposition to the carrying out of  Caesar's law for the allotment of the Campanian land--a subject which he  had himself brought before the senate only a short time before, and on  which he really continued to feel strongly.[14] Cicero's most elaborate  defence of his change of front is contained in a long letter to P.  Lentulus Spinther, written two years afterwards.[15] The gist of it is  much the same as the remark to Atticus already quoted. \"Pompey and  Caesar were all-powerful, and could not be resisted without civil  violence, if not downright civil war. The Optimates were feeble and  shifty, had shewn ingratitude to Cicero himself, and had openly favoured  his enemy Clodius.

Two years ago there were  sixty _safaris_, or shooting expeditions, sent out from Nairobi. When we  left, late in September, there were about thirty.    [Photograph: By courtesy of W.D. Boyce. The Great White Way in  Nairobi]    [Photograph: By courtesy of W.D. Boyce The Busiest Place in Nairobi]    [Photograph: Umbrella Acacias]    [Drawing: _The New Governor Looks Something Like Roosevelt_]    Each party must have from thirty to a couple of hundred camp attendants,  depending upon the number of white men in the party. Each white man,  requires, roughly, thirty natives to take care of him. In our party of  four white people we had one hundred and eighteen. One would presume  that the game would speedily be exterminated, yet it is said that the  game is constantly increasing. After one day's ride on the railway it  would be hard to conceive of game being more plentiful than it was while  we were there. Mr. Roosevelt carried nearly three hundred men with him,  collected a great quantity of game, and necessarily spent a great deal  of money. It is said that the expenses of his expedition approached ten  thousand dollars a month, but the chances are that this figure is much  more than the actual figure.    At the time of our arrival there was a shortage in the porter supply,  and we were obliged to take out men from a number of different tribes.  Swahili porters are considered the best, but there are not enough to go  round, so we had to take Swahilis, Bagandas, Kikuyus, Kavirondos,  Lumbwas, Minyamwezis, and a lot more of assorted races. Each porter  carries sixty pounds on his head, and when the whole outfit is on the  trail it looks like a procession of much importance.    The Norfolk Hotel is the chief rendezvous of Nairobi. In the course of  the afternoon nearly all the white men on hunting bent show up at the  hotel and patronize the bar. They come in wonderful hunting regalia and  in all the wonderful splendor of the Britisher when he is afield. There  is nearly always a great coming and going of men riding up, and of  rickshaws arriving and departing. Usually several tired sportsmen are  stretched out on the veranda of the long one-storied building, reading  the ancient London papers that are lying about. Professional guides,  arrayed in picturesque Buffalo Bill outfits, with spurs and  hunting-knives and slouch hats, are among those present, and amateur  sportsmen in crisp khaki and sun helmets and new puttees swagger back  and forth to the bar. There is no denying the fact that there is  considerable drinking in Nairobi. There was as much before we got there  as there was after we got there, however. After the arrival of the  European steamer at Mombasa business is brisk for several days as the  different parties sally forth for the wilds.    [Drawing: _At the Norfolk Hotel Bar_]    On our ship there were four different parties. A young American from  Boston, who has been spending several years doing archaeological work in  Crete, accompanied by a young English cavalry officer, were starting out  for a six-weeks' shoot south of the railway and near Victoria Nyanza.    Two professional ivory hunters were starting for German East Africa by  way of the lake. Mr. Boyce and his African balloonograph party of seven  white men were preparing for the photographing expedition in the Sotik,  and our party of four was making final preparations for our march.  Consequently there was much hurrying about, and Newland and Tarlton's  warehouse was the center of throngs of waiting porters and the scene of  intense activity as each party sorted and assembled its mountains of  supplies.    Seager and Wormald got off first, going by train to Kijabe, where they  were to begin their ten days' march in the Sotik. Here they were to try  their luck for two or three weeks and then march back, preparatory to  starting home.    The professional ivory hunters were slow in starting. There was delay in  getting mules. One of them had shot three hundred elephants in the  Belgian Congo during the last four years, and it was suspected he had  been poaching. The other had been caught by the Belgian authorities on  his last trip, lost all his ivory and guns by confiscation, but was  ready to make another try. The ivory game is a rich one and there are  always venturesome men who are willing to take chances with the law in  getting the prizes.    The Boyce party with its two balloons and its great number of box kites  and its moving picture equipment and its twenty-nine cameras and its  vast equipment was slow in starting, but it expected to get away on  September twenty-fourth, the day after we left. They planned to fill  their balloon in Nairobi and tow it at the end of a special train as far  as Kijabe, where they were to strike inland from the railway. They were  encamped on a hill overlooking the city, with their two hundred and  thirty porters ready for the field and their balloon ready to make the  first ascension ever attempted in East Africa.    Throngs of natives squatted about, watching the final preparations, and  doubtless wondered what the strange, swaying object was. On the evening  of the twenty-second the party gave a moving picture show at one of the  clubs for the benefit of St. Andrew's church. A great crowd of  fashionably dressed people turned out and saw the motion picture records  of events which they had seen in life only a couple of days before.  There were moving pictures of the arrival of the governor's special  train, his march through the city, and many other events that were fresh  in the minds of the audience. There were also motion pictures taken on  the ship that brought us down from Naples to Mombasa, and it was most  interesting to see our fellow passengers and friends reproduced before  us in their various athletic activities while on shipboard. Mr. Boyce  gave an afternoon show for children, an evening show for grown-ups, and  was to give another for the natives the following night. The charities  of Nairobi were much richer because of Mr. Boyce and his African  Balloonograph Expedition.    While in Nairobi we visited the little station where experiments are  being made in the \"sleeping sickness.\" An intelligent young English  doctor is conducting the investigations and great hopes are entertained  of much new information about that most mysterious ailment that has  swept whole colonies of blacks away in the last few years.    In many little bottles were specimens of the deadly tsetse fly that  causes all the infection. And the most deadly of all was the small one  whose distinguishing characteristic was its wings, which crossed over  its back. These we were told to look out for and to avoid them, if  possible. They occur only in certain districts and live in the deep  shade, near water. They also are day-biting insects, who do their biting  only between eleven o'clock in the morning and five o'clock in the  afternoon.    In the station there were a number of monkeys, upon which the fly was  being tried. They were in various stages of the disease, but it seemed  impossible to tell whether their illness was due to the sleeping  sickness germ or was due to tick fever, a common malady among monkeys.  In one of the rooms of the laboratory there were natives holding little  cages of tsetse flies against the monkeys, which were pinioned to the  floor by the natives. The screened cages were held close to the stomach  of the helpless monkey, and little apertures in the screen permitted the  fly to settle upon and bite the animal.    There are certain wide belts of land in Africa called the \"tsetse fly  belts,\" where horses, mules and cattle can not live. These districts  have been known for a number of years, long before the sleeping sickness  became known. In the case of animals, the danger could be minimized by  keeping the animals out of those belts, but in the case of humans the  same can not be done. One infected native from a sleeping sickness  district can carry the disease from one end of the country to the other,  and when once it breaks out the newly infected district is doomed.  Consequently the British authorities are greatly alarmed, for by means  of this deadly fly the whole population of East Africa might be wiped  out if no remedy is discovered. It has not yet been absolutely proven  that East Africa is a \"white man's country,\" and in the end it may be  necessary for him to give up hope of making it more than a place of  temporary residence and exploration.    We were also shown some ticks. They are the pests of Africa. They exist  nearly every place and carry a particularly malicious germ that gives  one \"tick fever.\" It is not a deadly fever, but it is recurrent and  weakening. There are all kinds of ticks, from little red ones no bigger  than a grain of pepper to big fat ones the size of a finger-nail, that  are exactly the color of the ground. They seem to have immortal life,  for they can exist for a long time without food. Doctor Ward told us of  some that he had put in a box, where they lived four years without food  or water. He also told us of one that was sent to the British museum,  put on a card with a pin through it, and lived over two years in this  condition. It is assumed, however, that it sustained fatal injuries,  because after a two years' fight against its wound it finally succumbed.    We were told to avoid old camping grounds while on _safari_, because  these spots were usually much infested with ticks waiting for new  camping parties. Wild game is always covered with ticks and carries them  all over the land. As you walk through the grass in the game country the  ticks cling to your clothes and immediately seek for an opening where  they may establish closer relations with you. Some animals, like the  rhino and the eland, have tick birds that sit upon their backs and"]]]
