We sat      once more \"in oor ain hoose at hame,\" or rather      outside it, near a certain pleasant chalet in a      wood, from which place you can see a brown and      turbulent river running downward to the sea.            THE THIRD TALE FROM \"WAVERLEY\"      I. THE CHIEF OF THE MAC-IVORS AND THE CHIEF'S SISTER    WHEN Edward awoke next morning, he could not for a moment remember where  he was. The cave was deserted. Only the grey ashes of the fire, a few  gnawed bones, and an empty keg remained to prove that he was still on  the scene of last night's feast. He went out into the sunlight. In a  little natural harbour the boat was lying snugly moored. Farther out, on  a rocky spit, was the mark of last night's beacon-fire. Here Waverley  had to turn back. Cliffs shut him in on every side, and Edward was at a  loss what to do, till he discovered, climbing perilously out in the rock  above the cave mouth, some slight steps or ledges. These he mounted with  difficulty, and, passing over the shoulder of the cliff, found himself  presently on the shores of a loch about four miles long, surrounded on  every side by wild heathery mountains.    In the distance he could see a man fishing and a companion watching him.  By the Lochaber axe which the latter carried Edward recognised the  fisher as Evan Dhu. On a stretch of sand under a birch tree, a girl was  laying out a breakfast of milk, eggs, barley bread, fresh butter, and  honeycomb. She was singing blithely, yet she must have had to travel far  that morning to collect such dainties in so desolate a region.    This proved to be Alice, the daughter of Donald Bean Lean, and it is  nothing to her discredit that she had made herself as pretty as she  could, that she might attend upon the handsome young Englishman. All  communication, however, had to be by smiles and signs, for Alice spoke  no English. Nevertheless she set out her dainties with right good-will,  and then seated herself on a stone a little distance away to watch for  an opportunity of serving the young soldier.    Presently Evan Dhu came up with his catch, a fine salmon-trout, and soon  slices of the fish were broiling on the wood embers. After breakfast,  Alice gathered what was left into a wicker basket, and, flinging her  plaid about her, presented her cheek to Edward for \"the stranger's  kiss.\" Evan Dhu made haste to secure a similar privilege, but Alice  sprang lightly up the bank out of his reach, and with an arch wave of  her hand to Edward she disappeared.    Then Evan Dhu led Edward back to the boat. The three men embarked, and  after emerging from the mouth of the cavern, a clumsy sail was hoisted,  and they bore away up the lake--Evan Dhu all the time loud in the  praises of Alice Bean Lean.    Edward said that it was a pity that such a maiden should be the daughter  of a common thief. But this Evan hotly denied. According to Evan, Donald  Bean Lean, though indeed no reputable character, was far from being a  thief. A thief was one who stole a cow from a poor cotter, but he who  lifted a drove from a Sassenach laird was \"a gentleman drover.\"    \"But he would be hanged, all the same, if he were caught!\" objected  Edward. \"I do not see the difference.\"    \"To be sure, he would _die for the law_, as many a pretty man has done  before him,\" cried Evan. \"And a better death than to die, lying on damp  straw in yonder cave like a mangy tyke!\"    \"And what,\" Edward suggested, \"would become of pretty Alice then?\"    \"Alice is both canny and fendy,\" said the bold Evan Dhu, with a cock of  his bonnet, \"and I ken nocht to hinder me to marry her mysel'!\"    Edward laughed and applauded the Highlander's spirit, but asked also as  to the fate of the Baron of Bradwardine's cattle.    \"By this time,\" said Evan, \"I warrant they are safe in the pass of  Bally-Brough and on their road back to Tully-Veolan. And that is more  than a regiment of King George's red soldiers could have brought about!\"    Evan Dhu had indeed some reason to be proud.    Reassured as to this, Edward accompanied his guide with more confidence  toward the castle of Vich Ian Vohr. The \"five miles Scots\" seemed to  stretch themselves out indefinitely, but at last the figure of a hunter,  equipped with gun, dogs, and a single attendant, was seen far across the  heath.    \"_Shogh_,\" said the man with the Lochaber axe, \"tat's the Chief!\"    Evan Dhu, who had boasted of his master's great retinue, denied it  fiercely.    \"The Chief,\" he said, \"would not come out with never a soul with him but  Callum Beg, to meet with an English gentleman.\"    But in spite of this prophecy, the Chief of Clan Ivor it was. Fergus  Mac-Ivor, whom his people called Vich Ian Vohr, was a young man of much  grace and dignity, educated in France, and of a strong, secret, and  turbulent character, which by policy he hid for the most part under an  appearance of courtesy and kindness. He had long been mustering his clan  in secret, in order once more to take a leading part in another attempt  to dethrone King George, and to set on the throne of Britain either the  Chevalier St. George or his son Prince Charles.    When Waverley and the Chief approached the castle--a stern and rugged  pile, surrounded by walls, they found a large body of armed Highlanders  drawn up before the gate.    \"These,\" said Vich Ian Vohr, carelessly, \"are a part of the clan whom I  ordered out, to see that they were in a fit state to defend the country  in such troublous times. Would Captain Waverley care to see them go  through part of their exercise?\"    Thereupon the men, after showing their dexterity at drill, and their  fine target-shooting, divided into two parties, and went through the  incidents of a battle--the charge, the combat, the flight, and the  headlong pursuit--all to the sound of the great warpipes.    Edward asked why, with so large a force, the Chief did not at once put  down such robber bands as that of Donald Bean Lean.    \"Because,\" said the Chief, bitterly, \"if I did, I should at once be  summoned to Stirling Castle to deliver up the few broadswords the  government has left us. I should gain little by that. But there is  dinner,\" he added, as if anxious to change the subject, \"let me show you  the inside of my rude mansion.\"    The long and crowded dinner-table to which Edward sat down, told of the  Chief's immense hospitality. After the meal, healths were drunk, and the  bard of the clan recited a wild and thrilling poem in Gaelic--of which,  of course, Edward could not understand so much as one word, though it  excited the clansmen so that they sprang up in ecstasy, many of them  waving their arms about in sympathy with the warlike verses. The Chief,  exactly in the ancient manner, presented a silver cup full of wine to  the minstrel. He was to drink the one and keep the other for himself.    After a few more toasts, Vich Ian Vohr offered to take Waverley up to be  presented to his sister. They found Flora Mac-Ivor in her parlour, a  plain and bare chamber with a wide prospect from the windows. She had  her brother's dark curling hair, dark eyes, and lofty expression, but  her expression seemed sweeter, though not, perhaps, softer. She was,  however, even more fiercely Jacobite than her brother, and her devotion  to \"the King over the Water\" (as they called King James) was far more  unselfish than that of Vich Ian Vohr. Flora Mac-Ivor had been educated  in a French convent, yet now she gave herself heart and soul to the good  of her wild Highland clan and to the service of him whom she looked on  as the true King.    She was gracious to Edward, and at the request of Fergus, told him the  meaning of the war-song he had been listening to in the hall. She was,  her brother said, famed for her translations from Gaelic into English,  but for the present she could not be persuaded to recite any of these to  Edward.    He had better fortune, however, when, finding Flora Mac-Ivor in a wild  spot by a waterfall, she sang him, to the accompaniment of a harp, a  song of great chiefs and their deeds which fired the soul of the young  man. He could not help admiring--he almost began to love her from that  moment.    After this reception, Edward continued very willingly at  Glennaquoich--both because of his growing admiration for Flora, and  because his curiosity increased every day as to this wild race, and the  life so different from all that he had hitherto known. Nothing occurred  for three weeks to disturb his pleasant dreams, save the chance  discovery, made when he was writing a letter to the Baron, that he had  somehow lost his seal with the arms of Waverley, which he wore attached  to his watch. Flora was inclined to blame Donald Bean Lean for the  theft, but the Chief scouted the idea. It was impossible, he said, when  Edward was his guest, and, besides (he added slyly), Donald would never  have taken the seal and left the watch. Whereupon Edward borrowed Vich  Ian Vohr's seal, and, having despatched his letter, thought no more of  the matter.    Soon afterwards, whilst Waverley still remained at Glennaquoich, there  was a great hunting of the stag, to which Fergus went with three hundred  of his clan to meet some of the greatest Highland chiefs, his  neighbours. He took Edward with him, and the numbers present amounted  almost to those of a formidable army. While the clansmen drove in the  deer, the chiefs sat on the heather in little groups and talked in low  tones. During the _drive_, the main body of the deer, in their  desperation, charged right upon the place where the chief sportsmen  were waiting in ambush. The word was given for every one to fling  himself down on his face. Edward, not understanding the language,  remained erect,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22675"],[0,"Home Life in Colonial Days (#7)"],[1,"legs; by day the frame with its  bed furnishings was hooked up to the wall, and covered with homespun  curtains or doors. This was the sleeping-place of the master and  mistress of the house, chosen because the kitchen was the warmest room  in the house. One of these \"turn-up\" bedsteads which was used in the  Sheldon homestead until this century may be seen in Deerfield Memorial  Hall.    Over the fireplace and across the top of the room were long poles on  which hung strings of peppers, dried apples, and rings of dried pumpkin.  And the favorite resting-place for the old queen's-arm or fowling-piece  was on hooks over the kitchen fireplace.    On the pothooks and trammels hung what formed in some households the  costliest house-furnishing,--the pots and kettles. The Indians wished  their brass kettles buried with them as a precious possession, and the  settlers equally valued them; often these kettles were worth three  pounds apiece. In many inventories of the estates of the settlers the  brass-ware formed an important item. Rev. Thomas Hooker of Hartford had  brass-ware which, in the equalizing of values to-day, would be worth  three or four hundred dollars. The great brass and copper kettles often  held fifteen gallons. The vast iron pot--desired and beloved of every  colonist--sometimes weighed forty pounds, and lasted in daily use for  many years. All the vegetables were boiled together in these great pots,  unless some very particular housewife had a wrought-iron potato-boiler  to hold potatoes or any single vegetable in place within the vast  general pot.    Chafing-dishes and skimmers of brass and copper were also cheerful discs  to reflect the kitchen firelight.    Very little tin was seen, either for kitchen or table utensils. Governor  Winthrop had a few tin plates, and some Southern planters had tin pans,  others \"tynnen covers.\" Tin pails were unknown; and the pails they did  own, either of wood, brass, or other sheet metal, had no bails, but were  carried by thrusting a stick through little ears on either side of the  pail. Latten ware was used instead of tin; it was a kind of brass. A  very good collection of century-old tinware is shown in the  illustration. By a curious chance this tinware lay unpacked for over  ninety years in the attic loft of a country warehouse, in the  packing-box, just as it was delivered from an English ship at the close  of the Revolution. The pulling down of the warehouse disclosed the box,  with its dated labels. The tin utensils are more gayly lacquered than  modern ones, otherwise they differ little from the tinware of to-day.    There was one distinct characteristic in the house-furnishing of olden  times which is lacking to-day. It was a tendency for the main body of  everything to set well up, on legs which were strong enough for adequate  support of the weight, yet were slender in appearance. To-day bureaus,  bedsteads, cabinets, desks, sideboards, come close to the floor;  formerly chests of drawers, Chippendale sideboards, four-post bedsteads,  dressing-cases, were set, often a foot high, in a tidy, cleanly fashion;  thus they could all be thoroughly swept under. This same peculiarity of  form extended to cooking-utensils. Pots and kettles had legs, as shown  in those hanging in the slave-kitchen fireplace; gridirons had legs,  skillets had legs; and further appliances in the shape of trivets,  which were movable frames, took the place of legs. The necessity for the  stilting up of cooking-utensils was a very evident one; it was necessary  to raise the body of the utensil above the ashes and coals of the open  fireplace. If the bed of coals and burning logs were too deep for the  skillet or pot-legs, then the utensil must be hung from above by the  ever-ready trammel.    Often in the corner of the fireplace there stood a group of trivets, or  three-legged stands, of varying heights, through which the exactly  desired proximity to the coals could be obtained.    Even toasting-forks, and similar frail utensils of wire or wrought iron,  stood on tall, spindling legs, or were carefully shaped to be set up on  trivets. They usually had, also, long, adjustable handles, which helped  to make endurable the blazing heat of the great logs. All such irons as  waffle-irons had far longer handles than are seen on any  cooking-utensils in these days of stoves and ranges, where the flames  are covered and the housewife shielded. Gridirons had long handles of  wood or iron, which could be fastened to the shorter stationary handles.  The two gridirons in the accompanying illustration are a century old.  The circular one was the oldest form. The oblong ones, with groove to  collect the gravy, did not vary in shape till our own day. Both have  indications of fittings for long handles, but the handles have vanished.  A long-handled frying-pan is seen hanging by the side of the  slave-kitchen fireplace.    An accompaniment of the kitchen fireplace, found, not in farmhouses, but  among luxury-loving town-folk, was the plate-warmer. They are seldom  named in inventories, and I know of but one of Revolutionary days, and  it is here shown. Similar ones are manufactured to-day; the legs,  perhaps, are shorter, but the general outline is the same.    An important furnishing of every fireplace was the andirons. In kitchen  fireplaces these were usually of iron, and the shape known as goose-neck  were common. Cob irons were the simplest form, and merely supported the  spit; sometimes they had hooks to hold a dripping-pan. A common name for  the kitchen andirons was fire-dogs; and creepers were low, small  andirons, usually used with the tall fire-dogs. The kitchen andirons  were simply for use to help hold the logs and cooking-utensils. But  other fireplaces had handsome fire-dogs of copper, brass, or cut steel,  cast or wrought in handsome devices. These were a pride and delight to  the housewife.    A primitive method of roasting a joint of meat or a fowl was by  suspending it in front of the fire by a strong hempen string tied to a  peg in the ceiling, while some one--usually an unwilling  child--occasionally turned the roast around. Sometimes the sole  turnspit was the housewife, who, every time she basted the roast, gave  the string a good twist, and thereafter it would untwist, and then twist  a little again, and so on until the vibration ceased, when she again  basted and started it. As the juices sometimes ran down in the roast and  left the upper part too dry, a \"double string-roaster\" was invented, by  which the equilibrium of the joint could be shifted. A jack was a  convenient and magnified edition of the primitive string, being a metal  suspensory machine. A still further glorification was the addition of a  revolving power which ran by clockwork and turned the roast with  regularity; this was known as a clock-jack. The one here shown hangs in  the fireplace in Deerfield Memorial Hall. A smoke-jack was run somewhat  irregularly by the pressure of smoke and the current of hot air in the  chimney. These were noisy and creaking and not regarded with favor by  old-fashioned cooks.    We are apt to think of the turnspit dog as a creature of European life,  but we had them here in America--little low, bow-legged, patient souls,  trained to run in a revolving cylinder and keep the roasting joint  a-turn before the fire. Mine host Clark of the State House Inn in  Philadelphia in the first half of the eighteenth century advertised in  Benjamin Franklin's _Pennsylvania Gazette_ that he had for sale \"several  dogs and wheels, much preferable to any jacks for roasting any joints of  meat.\" I hope neither he nor any one else had many of these little  canine slaves.    A frequent accompaniment of the kitchen fireplace in the eighteenth  century, and a domestic luxury seen in well-to-do homes, was the various  forms of the \"roasting-kitchen,\" or Dutch oven. These succeeded the  jacks; they were a box-like arrangement open on one side which when in  use was turned to the fire. Like other utensils of the day, they often  stood up on legs, to bring the open side before the blaze. A little door  at the back could be opened for convenience in basting the roast. These  kitchens came in various sizes for roasting birds or joints, and in them  bread was occasionally baked. The bake-kettle, which in some communities  was also called a Dutch oven, was preferred for baking bread. It was a  strong kettle, standing, of course, on stout, stumpy legs, and when in  use was placed among the hot coals and closely covered with a strong  metal, convex cover, on which coals were also closely heaped. Such  perfect rolls, such biscuit, such shortcake, as issued from the  heaped-up bake-kettle can never be equalled by other methods of cooking.    When the great stone chimney was built, there was usually placed on one  side of the kitchen fireplace a brick oven which had a smoke uptake into  the chimney--and-an ash-pit below. The great door was of iron. This oven  was usually heated once a week. A great fire of dry wood, called oven  wood, was kindled within it and kept burning fiercely for some hours.  This thoroughly heated all the bricks. The coals and ashes were then  swept out, the chimney draught closed, and the oven filled with brown  bread, pies, pots of beans, etc. Sometimes the bread was baked in pans,  sometimes it was baked in a great mass set on cabbage leaves or oak  leaves. In some towns an autumn harvest of oak leaves was gathered by  children to use throughout the winter. The leaves were strung on sticks.  This gathering was called going a-leafing.    By the oven side was always a long-handled shovel known as a peel or  slice, which sometimes had a rack or rest to hold it; this implement was  a necessity in order to place the food well within the glowing oven. The  peel was sprinkled with meal, great heaps of dough were placed thereon,  and by a dexterous twist they were thrown on the cabbage or "]]]
