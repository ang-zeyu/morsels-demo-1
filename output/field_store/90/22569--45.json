Then he returned with all speed, imagining for the  first time that possibly Egypt was the object of attack, and made for  Alexandria. On his arrival there he heard that nothing was known of the  French movements, although in fact their fleet was on that day lying at  anchor off Cape Harzet, twenty leagues to the west.    Supposing, therefore, that they must after all have sailed for the coast  of Syria or Constantinople, he steered for Alexandretta, and learning  that, after having captured Malta, the French fleet had sailed to  Candia, he left for Rhodes, searched everywhere through the islands of  the Archipelago, and it was only when he anchored off Cape Matapan, the  southern extremity of the Morea, that he first learned that the French  army had landed in Egypt a month before.    The object of the French expedition was a vast one, but the means with  which it was undertaken were insufficient for its execution, and the  difficulties in the way were infinitely greater than had been supposed  in Paris. Bonaparte had been chosen for its command principally because  the directory feared that the great popularity of the victorious general  would render him formidable to themselves. They knew already that he was  by no means favourably disposed towards them, and they were therefore  anxious to remove him from the public eye.    Napoleon, on his part, was perfectly aware of the reason for which he  was appointed to the command, but he accepted it under the belief that a  vast amount of glory was to be gained, and that, should the plans of the  directory be entirely carried out, and India wrested from the English,  his name would be placed by the side of Alexander in history. Already  negotiations had been carried on for some time with Tippoo Sahib.  Commissioners had been despatched to him, and an alliance proposed  against the British. His power had been greatly overrated by the French,  and but a feeble idea was entertained of the enormous difficulties of  the scheme they proposed, which was that, after completely subduing and  organizing Egypt, they should march through Syria and Damascus, thence  to the head of the Persian Gulf, and thence down through India.    No account had been taken of the enormous difficulties of the journey.  There was no thought of the powerful and warlike people of Northern  India. The only idea was to revenge the total overthrow of the French  power in India by the British, to re-establish it on a firmer and wider  base than ever, and so not only to humiliate the pride of England, but  to obtain a monopoly of the trade of the East.    The news that possibly a French fleet might at any moment appear before  the port spread the greatest dismay throughout Alexandria; the native  population were furious, and foreigners scarcely dared to show  themselves in the streets. Mr. Blagrove and Edgar were busy from morning  till night on the day after the British fleet had left, in transporting  the goods from the store to the ship that had been chartered.    \"It is quite possible that all this is needless,\" the merchant said to  Edgar when they sat down to a hasty meal late in the evening. \"I think  myself that it is almost absurd, although I do not mean to leave  anything to chance; but it is purely a surmise that the French  expedition is intended to operate against Egypt. It seems to me that  either Greece or Syria is much more likely to be its destination. I have  just had a letter put into my hand, brought by the captain of a small  Maltese trader. It is from a correspondent in Malta. He states that the  French fleet has appeared off the island and summoned the knights to  surrender, and that it is thought probable that the demand will be  acceded to. He said that he sent me a line by a little coaster that  intended to sail late that evening, and was taking a cargo of grain for  Alexandria.    \"That certainly looks as if the expedition is intended to operate  farther east, for Malta is altogether out of the way for a fleet coming  from Toulon hither. Still it is just as well to continue our work. There  is, naturally enough, a violent ferment among the native population, and  this may not improbably find vent in a fanatical attack upon the  Christians. At any rate, we will get the rest of our goods of any value  on board, and then await events.\"    By the next evening their preparations were completed. The ferment had  now somewhat cooled down, and people were beginning to think that the  excitement roused by a mere vague report was absurd. The next morning at  breakfast Mr. Blagrove said to his son:    \"I think, Edgar, that as things have quieted down, and we are all  beginning to hope that the scare was altogether unfounded, it would be  just as well that you should ride over to your friends in the desert,  stay the night there, and come back to-morrow. They would think it  strange and discourteous if we were to leave suddenly without  communicating with them; and as I hope our absence will be of short  duration, I should be very sorry to give people so well-disposed towards  you any ground for offence. But return by to-morrow evening. In the  extremely remote possibility of a French fleet being made out before  that time, I must embark at once, if only for your mother and sisters'  sake. It would be madness to wait here--simple madness. Even putting  aside the certainty of captivity for a very long period, it is by no  means improbable that there would be a sudden rising on the part of the  population, and a massacre of foreigners.    \"I consider the contingency so remote, that it is scarcely worth  speaking of; but if the French fleet should arrive during the thirty-six  hours that you will be away, and I am obliged to embark and sail off,  you must stay with your Arab friends. You see, I have some L8000 worth  of goods on board the _Petrel_, and the loss would be an extremely heavy  one for me; and I have besides L2000 in cash. I shall leave L1000 in  Muller's hands, which will be ample for his needs, as there is a very  heavy stock of ships' stores in the warehouse. I shall, of course,  instruct him to supply you with any money that you may require. You  understand that I regard all this as extremely improbable, but it is  just as well to make arrangements for every contingency. And then,  should the French fleet come in sight, I can embark on board the  _Petrel_, and set sail without any great anxiety on your account. More  to relieve my mind than because I think there is any reasonable ground  for thinking it necessary, here are fifty pounds in gold; you had best  sew them up securely in the band of your trousers to-night; it will be  no great trouble, and they will be safer there than if loose in your  pocket.\"    As Edgar rode away the next morning, he could not help thinking that it  would be great fun if the French were to arrive before he returned. The  thought of a year or two passed in a stuffy office in London was not an  agreeable one; while, were he to stay with the Bedouins, he might have a  life of excitement and adventure. No doubt they and the other tribes  would all fight against the invaders; impelled in the first place by  their intense love of independence, and in the second, because the  invaders were Christians. The thought of dashing charges, of skirmishing  with the French cavalry, of pursuit, of flight, was very fascinating to  a high-spirited lad of seventeen, and after indulging in these fancies  for some time, he sighed, as he thought how small was the chance of  their becoming reality.    He was heartily welcomed on his arrival at the oasis. The news that Sidi  had brought of the visit of the British fleet, and the fact that they  were in search of a great French fleet carrying an army that might  possibly be intended for the invasion of Egypt, had created great  excitement in the camp.    \"Do you think it can be true,\" the sheik asked him, \"that so wild an  idea can have come to these people, as to think that they could conquer  our country?\"    \"That I cannot say,\" Edgar replied. \"If they did come, they would be  very formidable opponents, for they have conquered many countries in  Europe; their soldiers are well trained and disciplined, and they will  have great numbers of guns; but my father thinks that they can hardly  intend to come here, for if they landed we should soon have enough  ships-of-war here to prevent their return, and they would be cut off  from France altogether. There is no news of their fleet, except that  they have arrived at the island of Malta. Whither they sailed thence we  know not. Our fleet has gone in search of them, and will fight them when  they find them. But if they should escape, and should really come  hither, my father and I will embark on board a ship which he has loaded  with his most valuable goods, and we shall at once sail for England. It  is for this reason that I have ridden over this morning. If we should  go, our departure will be very sudden, for we should get up anchor as  soon as the French fleet was made out in the distance, or, at any rate,  as soon as it became dark enough to hide our departure; and I should  have been sorry indeed to go without saying good-bye to you.\"    \"But for how long will you go, brother?\" Sidi asked.    \"Until the trouble was over here, which might be only two or three  months, but which might be as many years.\"    \"And will you be glad to go back to your own country?\" the sheik asked.    \"No, indeed. There I should have to work in an office in London, which  would be very dull, while here my work is light, I have amusements, and  I have my friends here.\"    \"Why not stay behind with us until your father returns? You know that  you would be most welcome, and that it would gladden all our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22245"],[0,"Steve and the Steam Engine (#7)"],[1,"a complete revolution  took place. The engine with moving parts, the ancestor of our modern  exquisitely constructed machinery, speedily crowded out the primitive  steam fountain idea. The new device was very imperfect, there can be no  question about that; but just as the steam fountain furnished the  inspiration for the engine with moving parts, so this forward step  became the working hypothesis for the engines that followed.\"    \"What engines did follow?\" Doris persisted, \"and who did invent our  steam engine?\"    \"Silly! And you in college,\" jeered Steve disdainfully.    \"I am not taking a course in steam engines there,\" laughed his sister  teasingly. \"Anyway, girls are not expected to know who invented all the  machines in the world, are they, Dad?\"    Mr. Tolman waited a moment, then said soothingly:    \"No, dear. Girls are not usually so much interested in scientific  subjects as boys are--although why they should not be I never could  quite understand. Nevertheless, I think it might be as well for even a  girl to know to whom we are indebted for such a significant invention as  the steam engine.    \"It was James Watt,\" Stephen asserted triumphantly.    \"It certainly was,\" his father agreed. \"And since your brother has his  information at his tongue's end, suppose we get him to tell us more  about this remarkable person.\"    Stephen flushed.    \"I'm afraid,\" began he lamely, \"that I don't know much more. You see, I  studied about him quite a long time ago and I don't remember the  details. I should have to look it up. I do recall the name, though--\"    His father looked amused.    \"I don't know which of you children is the more blameworthy,\" remarked  he in a bantering tone. \"Doris, who never heard of Watt; or Stephen, who  has forgotten all about him.\"    Both the boy and the girl chuckled good-humoredly.    \"At least I knew his name, Dad--give me credit for that,\" piped Steve.    \"That was something, certainly,\" Mrs. Tolman declared, joining in the  laugh.    \"Well, since neither of us can furnish the story, I don't see but that  you will have to do it, Dad,\" Doris said mischievously.    \"It would be a terrible humiliation if I should discover that I could  not do it, wouldn't it?\" replied Mr. Tolman with a smile. \"In point of  fact, there actually is not a great deal more that it is essential for  one to know. It was by perfecting the engines of the Newcomen type and  adding to them first one and then another valuable device that Watt  finally built up the forerunner of our present-day engine. The  progression was a gradual one. Now he would better one part, then some  other. He surrounded the cylinder, for example, with a jacket, or  chamber, which contained steam at the same pressure as that within the  boiler, thereby keeping it as hot as the steam that entered it--a very  important improvement over the old idea; then he worked out a plan by  which the steam could be admitted at each end of the cylinder instead of  at one end, as was the case with former engines. The latter innovation  resulted in the push and pull of the piston rod. So it went.\"    \"How did Watt come to know so much about engines?\" asked Stephen.    \"Oh, Watt was an engineer by trade--or rather he was a maker of  mathematical instruments for the University of Glasgow, where he came  into touch with a Newcomen engine. He also made surveys of rivers,  harbors, and canals. So you see it was quite a consistent thing that a  man with such a bent of mind should take up the pastime of experimenting  with a toy like the steam engine in his leisure hours.\"    \"Did he go so far as to patent it, Henry?\" Mrs. Tolman questioned.    \"Yes, he did. Many of our scientists either had not the wit to do this,  alas, or else they were too impractical to appreciate the value of their  ideas. In consequence the glory and financial benefit of what they did  was often filched from them. But Watt was a Scotchman and canny enough  to realize to some extent what his invention was worth. He therefore  obtained a patent on it which was good for twenty-five years; and when,  in 1800, this right expired he retired from business with both fame and  fortune.\"    \"It is nice to hear of one inventor who got something out of his toil,\"  Mrs. Tolman observed.    \"Indeed it is. Think of the many men who have slaved day and night,  forfeited health, friends, and money to give to the world an idea, and  never lived to receive either gratitude or financial reward, dying  unknown or entirely forgotten. There is something tragic about the  injustice of it. But Watt, I am glad to say, lived long enough to  witness the service he had done mankind and enjoy an honored place among  the great of the world.\"    \"Is the kind of engine Watt invented now in use?\" Doris inquired.    \"Yes, that is a double-acting or reciprocating engine of a more perfect  type,\" her father returned. \"Mechanics and engineers went on improving  Watt's engine just as he had improved those that had preceded it. It is  interesting, too, to notice that after thousands of years scientists  have again worked around to the steam turbine described so long ago in  the Alexandrian records. This engine, although it does away with many of  the moving parts introduced by Newcomen, preserves the essential  principles of that early engine combined with Watt's later improvements.  To-day we have a number of different kinds of engines, their variety  differing with the purpose to which they are applied. Their cost,  weight, and the space they require have been reduced and their power  increased, and in addition we have made it possible to run them not only  by means of coal or wood but by gasoline, oil, or electricity. We have  small, light-weight engines for navigation use; mighty engines to propel  our great warships and ocean liners; stationary engines for mills and  power plants; to say nothing of the wonderful locomotive engines that  can draw the heaviest trains over the highest of mountains. The  principle of all these engines is, however, the same and for the brain  behind them we must thank James Watt.\"    \"Was it Watt who invented the locomotive, too?\" ventured Doris. Her  father shook his head.    \"The perfecting of the locomotive, my dear, is, as Kipling says, another  story.\"    \"Tell it to us.\"    \"Not now, daughter,\" protested Mr. Tolman. \"I am far too hungry; and  more than that I am eager to enjoy this beautiful country and forget  railroads and locomotives.\"    \"Did you say you were hungry, Henry?\" asked Mrs. Tolman.    \"I am--starved!\" her husband said apologetically. \"Isn't it absurd to be  hungry so early in the day?\"    \"It is nearly noon, Dad!\" said Steve, glancing down at the clock in the  front of the car.    \"Noon! Why, I thought it was still the middle of the morning.\"    \"No, indeed! While you have been talking we have come many a mile, and  the time has slipped past,\" his wife said. \"If all goes well--\" The shot  from a bursting tire rent the air.    \"Which evidently it does not,\" interrupted Mr. Tolman grimly, bringing  the car to a stop. \"How aggravating! We were almost into Palmer, where I  had planned for us to lunch. Now it may be some little time before we  can get anything to eat.\"    \"Motorist's luck! Motorist's luck, my dear!\" cried Mrs. Tolman gaily.  \"An automobilist must resign himself to taking cheerfully what comes.\"    \"That is all very well,\" grumbled her husband, as he clambered out of  the car. \"Nevertheless you must admit that this mishap on the heels of  the other one is annoying.\"    Stephen also got out and the two bent to examine the punctured tire.    \"I should not mind so much if I were not so hungry,\" murmured Mr.  Tolman. \"How are you, Steve? Fainting away?\"    The boy laughed.    \"Well, I could eat something if I had it,\" he confessed.    \"I wish I hadn't mentioned food,\" went on Mr. Tolman humorously. \"It was  an unfortunate suggestion.\"    \"I'm hungry, too,\" piped Doris.    \"There, you see the epidemic you have started, Henry,\" called Mrs.  Tolman accusingly. \"Here is Doris vowing she is in the last throes of  starvation.\"    Nobody noticed that in the meanwhile the mother had reached down and  lifted into her lap the small suitcase hidden in the bottom of the car.  She opened the cover and began to remove its contents.    At length, when a remark her husband made to her went unheeded, he  sensed her preoccupation and came around to the side of the car where  she was sitting. Immediately he gave a cry of surprise.    \"My word!\" he exclaimed. \"Steve, come here and see what your mother  has.\"    Stephen looked.    There sat Mrs. Tolman, unpacking with quiet enjoyment sandwiches, eggs,  cake, cookies, and olives.    A shout of pleasure rose from the famished travelers.    \"So it was not your jewels, after all, Mater!\" cried Stephen.    \"No, and after the way you have slandered me and my little suitcase,  none of you deserve a thing to eat,\" his mother replied. \"However, I am  going to be magnanimous if only to shame you. Now climb in and we will  have our lunch. You can fix the tire afterward.\"    The men were only too willing to obey.    As with brightened faces they took their seats in the car, Stephen  smiled with affection at his mother.    \"Well, Mater, Watt was not the only person who lived to see himself  appreciated; and I don't believe people were any more grateful to him  for his steam engine than we are to you right now for this luncheon. You  are the best mother I ever had.\"          CHAPTER IV    THE STORY OF THE FIRST RAILROAD      The new tire went on with unexpected ease and early afternoon saw the  Tolmans once more bowling along the highway toward Northampton. The  valley of the Connecticut was decked with harvest products as for an  autumnal pageant.
