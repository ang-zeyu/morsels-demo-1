Aurelius, now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori (first landing, nos. 42,  43, 44). One of them, representing the emperor sacrificing before the  Temple of Jupiter, is given opposite page 90.    The decoration of the churches, like that of the temples, was mostly  done by private contributions and gifts of works of art. The laying  out of the pavement, for instance, or the painting of the walls was  apportioned to voluntary subscribers, each of whom was entitled to  inscribe his name on his section of the work. The pavement of the  lower basilica of Parenzo, in Dalmatia, is divided into mosaic panels  of various sizes, representing vases, wreaths, fish, and animals; and  to each panel is appended the name of the contributor:--    \"Lupicinus and Pascasia made one hundred [square] feet.    \"Clamosus and Successa, one hundred feet.    \"Felicissimus and his relatives, one hundred feet.    \"Fausta, the patrician, and her relatives, sixty feet.    \"Claudia, devout woman, and her niece Honoria, made one hundred and  ten feet, in fulfilment of a vow.\"[21]    Theseus killing the Minotaur in the labyrinth of Crete, and labyrinths  in general, were favorite subjects for church pavements, especially  among the Gauls. The custom is very ancient, a labyrinth having been  represented in the church of S. Vitale at Ravenna as early as the  sixth century. Those of the cathedral at Lucca, of S. Michele Maggiore  at Pavia, of S. Savino at Piacenza, of S. Maria in Trastevere at Rome  (destroyed in the restoration of 1867), are of a later date. The image  of Theseus is accompanied by a legend in the \"leonine\" rhythm:--        _Theseus intravit, monstrumque biforme necavit._    The symbolism of the subject is explained thus: The labyrinth, so easy  of access, but from which no one can escape, is symbolical of human  life. At the time of the Crusades, church labyrinths began to be used  for a practical purpose. The faithful were wont to go over the  meandering paths on their knees, murmuring prayers in memory of the  passion of the Lord. Under the influence of this practice the classic  and Carolingian name--labyrinth--was forgotten; and the new one of  _rues de Jerusalem_, or _leagues_, adopted. The _rues de Jerusalem_ in  the cathedral at Chartres, designed in blue marble, were 666 feet  long; and it took an hour to finish the pilgrimage. Later the  labyrinths lost their religious meaning, and became a pastime for  idlers and children. The one in the church at Saint-Omer has been  destroyed, because the celebration of the office was often disturbed  by irreverent visitors trying the sport.[22]    In Rome we have several instances of these private artistic  contributions in the service of churches. The pavement of S. Maria in  Cosmedin is the joint offering of many parishioners; and so were those  of S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura and S. Maria Maggiore before their modern  restoration. The names of Beno de Rapiza, his wife Maria Macellaria,  and his children Clement and Attilia are attached to the frescoes of  the lower church of S. Clemente; and that of Beno alone to the  paintings of S. Urbano alla Caffarella. In the apse of S. Sebastiano  in Pallara, on the Palatine, and in that of S. Saba on the Aventine,  we read the names of a Benedictus and of a Saba, at whose expense the  apses were decorated.    We cannot help following with emotion the development of this artistic  feeling even among the lowest classes of mediaeval Rome.[23] We read of  an AEgidius, son of Hippolytus, a shoemaker of the Via Arenula, leaving  his substance to the church of S. Maria de Porticu, with the request  that it should be devoted to the building of a chapel, \"handsome and  handsomely painted, so that everybody should take delight in looking  at it.\" Such feelings, exceptional in many Italian provinces, were  common throughout Tuscany. When the triptych of Duccio Buoninsegna,  now in the \"Casa dell' opera\" at Siena, was carried from his studio to  the Duomo, June 9, 1310, the whole population followed in a triumphant  procession. Renzo di Maitano, another Sienese artist of fame, had the  soul of a poet. He was the first to advocate the erection of a church,  \"grand, beautiful, magnificent, whose just proportions in height,  breadth, and length should so harmonize with the details of the  decoration as to make it decorous and solemn, and worthy of the  worship of Christ in hymns and canticles, for the protection and glory  of the city of Siena.\" So spoke the artists of that age, and their  language was understood and felt by the multitudes. Their lives were  made bright and cheerful in spite of the troubles and misfortunes  which weighed upon their countries. Think of such sentiments in our  age!    [Illustration: THE TRANSLATION OF S. CYRIL'S REMAINS (Fresco in S.  Clemente, done at the order of Maria Macellaria)]    But I am digressing from my subject. Another step of the religious and  material transformation of the city is marked by the substitution of  chapels and shrines for the old _arae compitales_, at the crossings of  the main thoroughfares. The institution of altars in honor of the  _Lares_, or guardian genii of each ward or quarter, is ancient, and  can be traced to prehistoric times. When Servius Tullius enclosed the  city with his walls, there were twenty-four such altars, called  _sacraria Argeorum_. Two facts speak in favor of their remote  antiquity. The priestess of Jupiter was not allowed to sacrifice on  them, unless in a savage attire, with hair unkempt and untrimmed. On  the 17th of May, the Vestals used to throw into the Tiber, from the  Sublician bridge, manikins of wickerwork, in commemoration of the  human sacrifices once performed on the same altars.    When Augustus reorganized the capital and its wards, in the year 7  B. C., the number of street-shrines had grown to more than two hundred.  Two hundred and sixty-five were registered, A. D. 73, in the census  of Vespasian; three hundred and twenty-four at the time of  Constantine. A man of much leisure, and evidently of no occupation,  the cavaliere Alessandro Rufini, numbered and described the shrines  and images which lined the streets of Rome in the year 1853. As  modern civilization and indifference will soon obliterate this  historical feature of the city, I quote some results of Rufini's  investigations.[24] There were 1,421 images of the Madonna, 1,318  images of saints, ornamented with 1,928 precious objects, and 110  ex-votos; 1,067 lamps were kept burning day and night before them,--a  most useful institution in a city whose streets have not been  regularly lighted until recent years.    [Illustration: The Shrine and Altar of Mercurius Sobrius.]    As prototypes of a classical and Christian street-shrine,  respectively, we may take the _aedicula compitalis_ of Mercurius  Sobrius, discovered in April, 1888, near S. Martino ai Monti, and the  _immagine di Ponte_, at the corner of the Via dei Coronari and the  Vicolo del Micio. The shrine of Mercury near S. Martino was dedicated  by Augustus, in the year 10 B. C. The inscription engraved on the  front of the altar says: \"The emperor Augustus dedicated this shrine  to Mercury in the year of the City, 744, from money received as a  new-year's gift, during his absence from Rome.\"    Suetonius (Chapter 57) says that every year, on January 1, all classes  of citizens climbed the Capitol and offered _strenae calendariae_ to  Augustus, when he was absent; and that the emperor, with his usual  generosity, appropriated the money to the purchase of _pretiosissima  deorum simulacra_, \"the most valuable statues of gods,\" to be set up  at the crossings of thoroughfares. Four pedestals of these statues  have already been found: one near the Arch of Titus, at the beginning  of the sixteenth century; one, in 1548, near the Senate House; one, in  the same year, by the Arch of Septimius Severus. The fourth pedestal,  that recently discovered near S. Martino ai Monti, was raised at the  crossing of two important streets, the _clivus suburanus_ (Via di S.  Lucia in Selci), and the _vicus sobrius_ (Via dei Quattro Cantoni),  from which the statue was nicknamed _Mercurius Sobrius_, \"Mercury the  teetotaller.\"    The _immagine di Ponte_, in the Via dei Coronari, the prototype of  modern shrines, contains an image of the Virgin in a graceful niche  built, or re-built, in 1523, by Alberto Serra of Monferrato, from  designs by Antonio da Sangallo. Its name is derived from that of the  lane leading to the Ponte S. Angelo (Canale di Ponte). The house to  which it belongs is No. 113 Via dei Coronari, and No. 5 Vicolo del  Micio.    Monumental crosses were sometimes erected instead of shrines. Count  Giovanni Gozzadini has called the attention of archaeologists to this  subject in a memoir \"Sulle croci monumentali che erano nelle vie di  Bologna del secolo XIII.\" He proves from the texts of historians,  Fathers, and councils that the practice of erecting crosses at the  junction of the main streets is very ancient, and belongs to the first  century of the freedom of the Church, when the faithful withdrew the  emblem of Christ from the catacombs, and raised it in opposition to  the street shrines of the gentiles. Bologna has the privilege of  possessing the oldest of these crosses. One bears the legend \"In the  name of God; this cross, erected long since by Barbatus, was renewed  under the bishopric of Vitalis (789-814).\" This class of monuments  abounds in Rome, although it belongs to a comparatively recent age.  Such are the crosses before the churches of SS. Sebastiano, Cesareo,  Nereo ed Achilleo, Pancrazio, Lorenzo, Francesco a Ripa, and others.    The most curious and interesting is perhaps the column of Henry IV. of  France, which was erected under Clement VIII. in front of S. Antonio  all' Esquilino, and which the modern generation has concealed in a  recess on the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22157"],[0,"Lectures on Stellar Statistics (#7)"],[1,"catalogue of the stars nearest  to the pole in PARKHURST's \"Yerkes actinometry\" (1912),[11] which  contains all stars in B. D. brighter than 7m.5 between the pole and 73 deg.  northern declination. The total number of stars is 672.    During the last few years the astronomers of Harvard and Mount Wilson  have produced a collection of \"standard photographic magnitudes\" for  faint stars. These stars, which are called the _polar sequence_,[12] all  lie in the immediate neighbourhood of the pole. The list is extended  down to the 20th magnitude. Moreover similar standard photographic  magnitudes are given in H. A. 71, 85 and 101.    A discussion of the _colour-index_ (_i.e._, the difference between the  photographic and the visual magnitudes) will be found in L. M. II, 19.  When the visual magnitude and the type of spectrum are known, the  photographic magnitude may be obtained, with a generally sufficient  accuracy, by adding the colour-index according to the table 1 in Sec.15  above.      26. _Stellar spectra._ Here too we find the Harvard Observatory to be  the leading one. The same volume of the Annals of the Harvard  Observatory (H. 50) that contains the most complete catalogue of visual  magnitudes, also gives the spectral types for all the stars there  included, _i.e._, for all stars to 6m.5. Miss CANNON, at the Harvard  Observatory, deserves the principal credit for this great work. Not  content with this result she is now publishing a still greater work  embracing more than 200000 stars. The first four volumes of this work  are now published and contain the first twelve hours of right  ascension, so that half the work is now printed.[13]      27. _Radial velocity._ In this matter, again, we find America to be the  leading nation, though, this time, it is not the Harvard or the Mount  Wilson but the Lick Observatory to which we have to give the honour. The  eminent director of this observatory, W. W. CAMPBELL, has in a high  degree developed the accuracy in the determination of radial velocities  and has moreover carried out such determinations in a large scale. The  \"Bulletin\" No. 229 (1913) of the Lick Observatory contains the radial  velocity of 915 stars. At the observatory of Lund, where as far as  possible card catalogues of the attributes of the stars are collected,  GYLLENBERG has made a catalogue of this kind for the radial velocities.  The total number of stars in this catalogue now amounts to 1640.[14]      28. Finally I shall briefly mention some comprehensive works on more  special questions regarding the stellar system.    On _variable stars_ there is published every year by HARTWIG in the  \"Vierteljahrschrift der astronomischen Gesellschaft\" a catalogue of all  known variable stars with needful information about their minima &c.  This is the completest and most reliable of such catalogues, and is  always up to date. A complete historical catalogue of the variables is  given in \"Geschichte und Literatur des Lichtwechsels der bis Ende 1915  als sicher veraenderlich anerkannten Sterne nebst einem Katalog der  Elemente ihres Lichtwechsels\" von G. MUeLLER und E. HARTWIG. Leipzig  1918, 1920.    On _nebulae_ we have the excellent catalogues of DREYER, the \"New  General Catalogue\" (N. G. C.) of 1890 in the \"Memoirs of the  Astronomical Society\" vol. 49, the \"Index catalogues\" (I. C.) in the  same memoirs, vols. 51 and 59 (1895 and 1908). These catalogues contain  all together 13226 objects.    Regarding other special attributes I refer in the first place to the  important Annals of the Harvard Observatory. Other references will be  given in the following, as need arises.

The number of cases in which all the eight attributes of the stars  discussed in the first chapter are well known for one star is very  small, and certainly does not exceed one hundred. These cases refer  principally to such stars as are characterized either by great  brilliancy or by a great proper motion. The principal reason why these  stars are better known than others is that they lie rather near our  solar system. Before passing on to consider the stars from more general  statistical points of view, it may therefore be of interest first to  make ourselves familiar with these well-known stars, strongly  emphasizing, however, the exceptional character of these stars, and  carefully avoiding any generalization from the attributes we shall here  find.      30. _The apparently brightest stars._ We begin with these objects so  well known to every lover of the stellar sky. The following table  contains all stars the apparent visual magnitude of which is brighter  than 1m.5.    The first column gives the current number, the second the name, the  third the equatorial designation ([alpha][delta]). It should be  remembered that the first four figures give the hour and minutes in  right ascension, the last two the declination, italics showing negative  declination. The fourth column gives the galactic square, the fifth and  sixth columns the galactic longitude and latitude. The seventh and  eighth columns give the annual parallax and the corresponding distance  expressed in siriometers. The ninth column gives the proper motion  ([mu]), the tenth the radial velocity _W_ expressed in sir./st. (To get  km./sec. we may multiply by 4.7375). The eleventh column gives the  apparent visual magnitude, the twelfth column the absolute magnitude  (_M_), computed from _m_ with the help of _r_. The 13th column gives the  type of spectrum (_Sp_), and the last column the photographic magnitude  (_m'_). The difference between _m'_ and _m_ gives the colour-index  (_c_).
