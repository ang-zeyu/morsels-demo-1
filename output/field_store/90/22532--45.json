I felt I could do this well and  successfully.  I determined to try the experiment upon this old lady.  I  walked quietly up to her, took the shutters out of her hands and laid  them in their proper places.  I then took a broom and began sweeping away  the water which had accumulated in front of her cottage, and seeing a  kettle inside the door, I walked gravely into the house, took it, and  filled it at a pump close by.  The old woman was dumb-struck.  Not a word  did she say, but stood looking on with mute amazement, which was still  more intensely exhibited when I went to the fire-place, raked out the  cinders, took up some sticks and commenced making a fire.  Not a word  passed between us.  It was with great difficulty I could keep my  countenance.  We must have looked a curious couple.  The woman standing  staring at me, I sitting on a three-legged stool, with my elbows on my  knees looking steadfastly at her.  At length she broke this unnatural  silence.  Speaking in her broad Lancashire dialect I could scarcely make  her out.  My own deficiency in not understanding much English increased  my difficulty, but I understood her to ask \"Who I was, and whither I was  going.\"  This she repeated until, having sufficiently excited her  curiosity, I opened my mouth very wide, kept my tongue quite close so  that it might seem as if I had none, and with my fingers to my ears made  a gesture that I was deaf and dumb.  She then said, \"Poor man, poor man,\"  with great feeling and gave me a welcome.  So I sat before the fire, and  commenced drying my clothes, which were saturated during my walk.  I  suppose I must have fallen asleep, for the next thing I noticed was a  substantial meal laid on the table, consisting of bread, cold bacon, and  beer.  Pointing to the food the old woman motioned to me to partake, and  this I was not loath to do.  I made a hearty meal.  I should tell you,  before we sat down to the table I had pulled out my pockets to show her I  had no money.  The woman made a sign that she did not want payment for  her kindness.  When we had finished our meal I looked about me, and  seeing that several things wanted putting to rights, such as emptying a  bucket, getting in some coals, and cleaning down the front pavement of  the house, I commenced working hard as some repayment for the hospitality  I had received.  We Frenchmen can turn our hands to almost anything, and  my dexterity quite pleased the old lady.  While I was busily sweeping the  hearth, I heard the sound of a horse's feet coming swiftly onward.  Terror-struck, I did a foolish thing.  Fancying it must be some one in  pursuit of me, I dropped the little broom I was using, seized my cap from  one of the chairs, opened the back door of the cottage, and fled along  the garden walk, over-leaped a hedge, crossed a brook, and was off like a  hunted hare across the open fields.  This was a silly proceeding, because  if the horseman had been any one in pursuit, the chances were that,  should he have entered the cottage, I might not have been recognized; and  if I had simply hid myself in some of the outbuildings that were near I  might have escaped notice altogether, while by running across the fields  I exposed myself to observation, and to be taken.  When half over a field  I found there a small clump of trees, and a little pond.  Down the side  of this pond I slipped and hid myself amongst the rushes; but I need not  have given myself any anxiety or trouble, for I saw the horseman,  whatever might have been his errand, flying along the winding road in the  distance.    \"Having satisfied myself of my security, I started off and soon found  myself on the highroad again, and after a time I came near a fine old  mansion which presented a most venerable appearance.  I could not stop,  however, to look at it, for I found I had taken a wrong turn and was  going back to Liverpool.  I therefore retraced my steps and passed on,  going I know not whither.  After walking for about an hour in a southerly  direction, feeling tired and seeing a barn open I went to it and found  two men therein threshing wheat.  I made signs to them that I was deaf  and dumb, and asked leave to lie in the straw.  They stared at me very  much, whispered amongst themselves, and at length, made a sign of assent.  I fell asleep.  When I awoke the sun was up and bright, while all trace  of the night-storm had disappeared.  I wondered at first where I was.  Seeing the fresh straw lying about, an idea struck me that I could earn a  few pence by a little handiwork.  I thereupon commenced making some straw  baskets, the like of which you have often seen myself and  fellow-prisoners manufacture.  By the time I had completed two or three  the men came again into the barn and began to work with their flails.  I  stepped forward with my baskets, which seemed to surprise them.  The like  they had evidently never seen before--they examined them with the  greatest attention.  One of the men, pulling some copper money out of his  pocket, offered it for one of them.  Grateful for the shelter I had  received, I pushed back the man's hand which contained the money and  offered him the basket as a present, pointing to my bed of straw.  The  honest fellow would not accept it, saying I must have his money.  I  therefore sold him one of the baskets, and another was also purchased by  one of the other men.  They seemed astonishingly pleased with their  bargains.  Just as they had concluded their dealings with me a big man  came into the barn, who I found out was the master.  The men showed him  the baskets and pointed to me, telling the farmer that I was a \"dumby and  deafy.\"  The big farmer hereupon bawled in my ear the question, \"who was  I, and where had I come from?\"  I put on a perfectly stolid look although  the drum of my ears was almost split by his roaring.  The farmer had a  soft heart, however, in his big and burly frame.  Leaving the barn, he  beckoned me to follow him.  This I did.  He went into the farm-house,  and, calling his wife, bade her get dinner ready.  A capital piece of  beef, bread, and boiled greens or cabbages were soon on the table, to  which I sat down with the farmer and his wife.  Their daughter, soon  after we had commenced eating, came in.  Her attention was immediately  attracted by my remaining basket, which I had placed by them.  I got up  from the table and presented it to her.  Her father then told her of my  supposed infirmities.  I could scarcely help laughing while I heard them  canvass my personal appearance, my merits and demerits.  Pity, however,  seemed to be the predominant feeling.  When the dinner was over, I  happened to look up at an old clock and saw that it had stopped.  I went  up to it, and took it from the nail.  I saw it wanted but very little to  make it go again.  I therefore quietly, but without taking notice of my  companions, set to work to take off the face and do the needful repairs.  A pair of pincers on the window-ledge and some iron wire, in fact, an old  skewer, were all the tools necessary; and very soon, to the satisfaction  of my host, his wife, and his fair daughter, the clock was set going as  well as it ever had done.  The farmer slapped me on the back and gave me  great encouragement.  I then cast my eyes about to see what I could do  next.  I mended a chair, repaired a china image, cleaned an old picture,  and taking a lock from a door repaired it, altering the key so that it  became useful.  In fact, I so busied myself, and with such earnestness  that by night-time I had done the farmer a good pound's worth of  repairing.  I then had my supper, and was made to understand I might  sleep in the barn, if I liked.  On the next morning the farmer's daughter  found me very busy in the yard with the pigs, which I was feeding; in  fact, the whole of that day I worked hard, because I thought if I could  remain where I was until the wonder of our escapade was over, I might  eventually get away altogether from England by some unforeseen piece of  good fortune.  For some time I worked at this farm, for, as if by mutual  consent of the farmer and myself, I remained, getting only my food for my  work; however, at the end of each week the farmer's wife gave me quietly  some money.  I made several little fancy articles for Mademoiselle which  she seemed highly to prize; but it was through her that I left my snug  quarters.  The principal labourer on the farm was courting, on the sly,  this young woman, and I noticed he became sulky with me, as Miss Mary on  several occasions selected me to perform some little service for her.  From an expression I heard him make use of to one of the other men I felt  sure he was about to do me some act of treachery and unkindness, and, as  I was no match for the great Hercules he seemed to be, I thought it best  to leave the place, as any disturbance might draw down attention upon me  too closely.  I therefore put up my spare clothes, some of which had been  given to me by the farmer's wife--a kindly, Christian woman she was--and  hiding my little store of money securely in my breeches' waistband, very  early one fine morning I set off with a heart by no means light, from the  place where I had been so well-treated, not knowing where on earth to go  or what next to do.  Before I went, however, to show I was grateful for  their kindness, I made up a little parcel which I addressed to the  farmer's wife, in which I put a tobacco-box for Mr. John Bull, a  bodkin-case for herself, and a little ring for Miss Mary, all of which I  had made in my leisure time.  I dare say they were sorry to part with me.  I am sure Miss Mary was, for I fancied she suspected I was not what I  seemed, and had begun to take an evident liking to me.  I had taught her  some French modes of cooking, which excited surprise, as well as  gratification to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],[0,"Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#7)"],[1,".\"    But a good rub at his eyes seemed to bring a little thoughtfulness as  well, and he climbed put of the waggon and descended to the ground.    \"I don't think you will have anything to alarm you, my boy,\" said his  father.  \"Wake me up though if there is the slightest sign of danger.\"    Jack promised, and, shivering and uncomfortable, he crept up to the  fire, which the Zulu renewed; but though he roasted his face and knees,  his back felt horribly cold, and he heartily wished himself at home, and  in his snug bed.  But the Zulu began to look round at the cattle, to  satisfy himself that all were safe; and then seating himself with his  assegai across his knees close to the fire, he began to tell the young  Englishman about the dangers that would have surrounded them if they had  encamped here a few years earlier; and, then he lapsed into such vivid  accounts of his own hunting adventures and escapes, that the four hours'  watch seemed to have passed like magic, and Jack was ready to finish the  next; but recalling the last injunctions he had received from his  father, he went to the waggon, roused up Dick, and from under it Dinny  and Coffee, and soon after left them to finish the morning watch.    Jack felt as if it would be of no use to try and sleep again; but  knowing that their next day's journey would be very fatiguing, he lay  down in his brother's place, found the blankets very warm and cosy, and  then, with the sound of Dinny yawning loudly, he fell fast asleep.  He  seemed hardly to have closed his eyes, when a shout aroused him, just as  he heard his father seize his double rifle, and go to the front of the  waggon.    Jack did likewise, with as much speed as his sleepy confusion would  allow; and on reaching the opening he found that it was still dark, so  that he could not have been long asleep, the fire was burning  brilliantly, and every one was on the alert.    \"Yes, I seemed to hear it myself in my sleep,\" said Mr Rogers, in  answer to some words spoken by Dick.  \"Did it sound near?\"    \"Sure, sor, it was close by, and I thought the bastes had got one of the  bullocks.\"    The Zulu was with them now, having sprung from his place beneath the  waggon, asking eagerly what was wrong.    \"They heard a lion prowling round,\" replied Mr Rogers.    \"No, no,\" said the Zulu.  \"No lion here.\"    \"But I heard it quite plainly,\" said Dick, who felt angry at being  doubted.    \"Sure and I did too, so close to me shoulder that I could feel the  baste's breath blow over on to me chake.\"    \"No, no,\" said the Zulu.  \"Look! see!\"    He pointed towards the oxen and horses in turn.    \"But it would be impossible to see it in this darkness,\" said Mr  Rogers.    \"Yes, but the oxen,\" said the Zulu.  \"They would not lie quiet if there  was a lion.\"    \"Of course not,\" said Mr Rogers, envying the savage his knowledge.  \"Then what caused the alarm?\"    There was no reply; and after satisfying themselves that all was safe,  and piling up the rest of the wood upon the fire--for the streaks of the  coming dawn could be seen--the tired watchers returned to the waggon,  and slept until roused for breakfast, when the secret of the alarm came  out, Coffee having been afraid to confess at the time that he knew it  was his brother imitating the lion's cry in his sleep, his proximity to  Dick and Dinny making it seem the more real.  Feeling sure that he would  be punished if he spoke, Coffee had remained silent, and so the matter  ended, Dick laughing heartily at the false alarm, though Dinny would not  believe that the cry emanated from the boy.    \"Jist as if I was such a biby as to belave that story, Masther Jack,\" he  said.  \"I tell ye it was the lion himself attacking the bastes, and  you'll see he'll be about the camp now every night, as regular as  clockwork.  It's very good of the masther to try and put one at his aise  about the wild bastes; but that there was a lion--I know it was; and if,  Masther Jack, dear, I'm missing some night, ye may know that there's a  lion aiting of me; and I hope ye'll take me bones back and give me a  dacent burying somewhere among Christians, and not lave them kicking  about out here in a foreign land.\"    \"But how can you be so stupid, Dinny?  Father says it was Chicory, and  you know how he imitates the wild beasts.\"    \"Ah, do ye take me for a baby, Masther Jack?\" said the man,  reproachfully.  \"There, let it go.  I'm your father's servant, and he  must have his own way; but it's cruel work this coming out into such  savage lands; and there's one man as will niver see home parts again.\"    When once Dinny had got an idea in his, head, to use his own words, \"a  shillelagh would not knock it out;\" so he remained perfectly certain  that the camp had been attacked by a lion; and he went about prophesying  that the coming night would produce two.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    HOW THE BOYS FOUND IT WAS NOT EASY TO SHOOT.    The oxen were in-spanned and the horses saddled, on as glorious a  morning as ever shone over the great African continent.  The breakfast  things had been stowed away, a glance given round to see that nothing  had been left behind; the driver's and foreloper's whips cracked; and  with loud shouts of, \"Trek, boys, trek!\" the great waggon slowly went on  its course, every one forgetting the troubles of the disturbed night, in  the glorious sunshine and dew-glittering herbage.    Coffee and Chicory ran and bounded and spun their kiris in the air,  catching them again, and then running on beside the cantering horses of  their young masters, while their father ran beside Mr Rogers' big bay.  Above all, the dogs showed their delight by barking, yelping, and making  insane charges here and there, Rough'un's great delight being to run his  head into one or other of the holes made by the burrowing animals of the  plains, and then worrying and snapping at nothing until he was called  away.    As the waggon lumbered on, father and sons wandered off to left or  right, exploring, examining the trees and strange plants, and sometimes  bringing down some bright-plumaged bird, which was carefully laid in a  tin case carried for the purpose by the Zulu, ready to be skinned and  dressed to keep as a specimen on their return.    That they were approaching the game country was now hourly becoming  plainer, for from time to time little knots of bok could be seen upon  the hills; but when Dick or Jack eagerly drew the attention of the Zulu  to the fact, he laughed, and said it was nothing, bidding them to wait.    \"We must have some venison for dinner to-day, boys,\" said Mr Rogers,  cantering up; \"so one of you had better try your rifle.  Who's it to  be?\"    \"Let it be Jack, father,\" said Dick, quietly; \"my hands are not steady  yet.\"    \"Very good,\" said Mr Rogers; while the Zulu listened attentively,  trying to comprehend every word.  \"Now then, Jack, how shall you go to  work?  There is a little herd of half-a-dozen springbok there, on that  hill, nearly a mile away.\"    \"Get close and shoot them,\" replied Jack, stoutly.    \"Say, if you can, my boy,\" replied Mr Rogers, smiling.  \"Now look here,  Jack, this is the way the Boers shoot springbok, and I don't think you  will find a better plan.  Have a few cartridges handy, so that you can  load quickly, and then gallop easily towards the herd, which will begin  playing about, till they grow too alarmed to let you get nearer, and  then they'll bound off.  This is your time: gallop up as close as you  can, and when you see they are about to go, leap from your horse and  fire--reload, and fire again.  If you are very quick you may get three  shots at the herd before they are out of range.\"    \"But suppose I miss, father?\" said Jack.    \"Don't suppose anything of the kind, my boy,\" said Mr Rogers, smiling;  \"but go and do it.  Time enough to consider failure when you have  failed.\"    Jack nodded, opened the breech of his gun, placed half-a-dozen  cartridges ready, leaped down to tighten the girths of his saddle, the  cob standing perfectly still.  Then mounting once more, he waved his  hand, touched his horse's sides with his heels, and away it went like  the wind.    As he started, Chicory, who seemed to have adopted him as his leader,  made a bound at the saddle, caught hold of the pommel, and ran by his  side with marvellous speed.    The springbok seemed to pay not the slightest heed to their approach,  and Jack was beginning to feel excited with the chase, and to calculate  how far they should be able to get before having to dismount, when all  at once there was a sudden check; he went flying over his horse's head,  his double barrel escaped from his hand, and he found himself lying on  the hard sandy earth, confused and puzzled, with Chicory trying to pull  him up; and Stockings standing close by, snorting and shivering with  fear.    Jack got up, and limped to where his rifle lay, feeling stupid, and  wondering how it was that he had been thrown; and he had but regained  his piece, and was ruefully examining it, when his father and Dick came  galloping up.    \"Much hurt, my boy?\" cried Mr Rogers, eagerly.    \"Only my leg and arm a little,\" said Jack, rubbing first one and then  the other; \"but I did think I could ride better than that, father.\"    \"Ride, my boy?  Why, no one could have helped that.  Don't you know how  it was?\"    \"I know Stockings threw me,\" replied Jack.    \"Threw you?  Nonsense, boy!  He set his fore feet in an ant-bear hole,  and turned a complete somersault.  We were afraid that he had rolled  upon you.\"    \"Then a good rider couldn't have helped it, father?\"    \"Helped it?  No, my boy.\"    \"Oh, I feel better now,\" said Jack, laughing; and, limping up to his  horse, he patted its neck and remounted, though not without difficulty.  \"Where's the bok, Chicory?\"    Chicory pointed to where they were, nearly a mile away, and looking  exceedingly small, but quite clear in the bright African atmosphere; and  without a word "]]]
