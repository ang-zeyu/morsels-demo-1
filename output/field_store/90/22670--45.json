[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24561"],[0,"A Report of the Debates and Proceedings in the Secret Sessions of the Conference (#7)"],[1,"DENT:--I take this opportunity to announce to the Convention  that the Door-keeper of the House of Representatives has transmitted  to the Chair cards admitting members of this body on to the floor of  the House. These cards will be delivered by the Secretary to such  members as call for them.    Mr. CHASE:--I move that any propositions or resolutions which members  of this Convention desire to have considered by the Committee on  Resolutions and Propositions, may be presented to the committee  through the Secretary, without being presented in Convention.    The motion was agreed to, and on motion the Convention adjourned until  Wednesday the 13th instant, at 12 o'clock M.          EIGHTH DAY.    WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, _February 13th, 1861._      The Convention was called to order by the PRESIDENT, and prayer was  offered by Rev. Dr. EDWARDS. The Journal, after sundry amendments, was  approved.    Mr. GUTHRIE:--The Committee on Resolutions, &c., have labored  diligently, and held protracted sessions, in the hope of being able to  make their report to-day. This they find themselves unable to do. They  are fully impressed with the necessity of immediate action, in view of  the short time that will remain for Congress to consider the action of  this Convention, if it shall become necessary to submit any  proposition of this body to be acted upon by that. I have no doubt we  shall be able to report on Friday, and I ask that we may have until  that time to make a report.    The request of Mr. GUTHRIE was acceded to.    Mr. SEDDON:--The time has now arrived when, as one of the  Commissioners from the State of Virginia, I find it necessary to ask  the leave of the Convention to communicate to the Legislative  authorities of Virginia, and to her Convention now in session, the  state of the proceedings before this body, and the committee. I ask  for liberty to do so, and believe that a proper regard to the  instructions of the Legislature of the State under which my  appointment is made, requires that my request should be granted.    Mr. BARRINGER offered the following resolution:         _Resolved_, That the Commissioners of any State represented       in this Convention, upon their joint application, have leave       to communicate to the Legislature, Governor, or Convention       of said State, the proceedings of this body, or so much       thereof as they may deem expedient.    Mr. SEDDON:--The passage of this resolution is all I ask.    Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN:--I move to amend the resolution by adding thereto:  \"But not to communicate what has transpired in the committee, before  said committee has reported to the Convention.\"    Mr. SEDDON:--I do not deem the passage of the resolution at this  moment as very important. At the suggestion of several gentlemen, I  will move to lay it on the table, subject to be called up after  Friday.    The Convention then adjourned to Friday at 12 o'clock.    On the evening of February 13th, the members of the Conference were  informed of the death of Hon. JOHN C. WRIGHT, of Ohio, who officiated  as temporary chairman previous to the permanent organization. In view  of the anxious desire of all the members to recognize their  appreciation of this act of Divine Providence, in removing from the  sphere of his earthly labors one of the most valued Commissioners in  attendance, President TYLER was requested to summon a special meeting  of the Conference. In pursuance of his invitation, all the members  attended on the morning of February 14th, when the following  proceedings were had:    THURSDAY, WASHINGTON CITY, _February 14th, 1861._    The Convention met in special session, pursuant to the call of the  President.    The proceedings were opened with prayer by the Rev. Dr. HALL.    The following letter from the Secretary, CRAFTS J. WRIGHT, was read,  and ordered to be entered upon the minutes:         WILLARD'S HOTEL,                        }       WASHINGTON CITY, _February 13th, 1861._ }         _Hon._ JOHN TYLER, _President of Conference Convention._         DEAR SIR:--I grieve to communicate to you the fact, that the       delegate from Ohio to this Conference Convention, the Hon.       JOHN C. WRIGHT, departed this life this day, the 13th       February, at half-past one o'clock.         Judge WRIGHT came to this Convention with a heart filled       with fear for the safety of the Union. Though at an advanced       age and nearly blind, he was filled with an earnest desire       to add his efforts to that of others of the Convention       called by the State of Virginia, and seek to agree on some       measures honorable to each and all, to effect the object.       Since the arrival of my father in Washington, he has been       constant in his efforts to effect the end in view, and he       has had his heart cheered with the belief that the object       would be accomplished. Almost the last words that he uttered       were, that he believed the Union would be preserved. He       desired me to say, if the Union were preserved, he would die       content. He called me to read to him, at 12 o'clock, the       sections in the Constitution in regard to counting the       votes, and this request, and this reading, terminated his       knowledge on earth. In this desire of my father to do what       he could, he pressed me to accompany him on account of his       blindness. Since the Convention honored me with the       appointment of Secretary, he required of me a promise that I       would not leave the position. When I read the section of the       Constitution to him, he required me then to leave him for       the Convention. Whatever my personal feelings may be, I deem       the pledge made sacred. I therefore ask that I may have       leave of absence, until I carry the remains home to Ohio,       and return to my duty.         Respectfully,         CRAFTS J. WRIGHT.         P.S.--J. HENRY PULESTON will act for me in my absence.    The PRESIDENT informed the Convention that the request of the  Secretary had been complied with. The PRESIDENT asked what action the  Convention proposed to take on the subject for which they had been  specially assembled.    The Hon. SALMON P. CHASE, of Ohio, then said:--Mr. PRESIDENT, since we  assembled yesterday in this Hall, it has pleased God to remove one of  our number from all participation in the concerns of earth. It is my  painful duty to announce to the Convention that JOHN C. WRIGHT, one of  the Commissioners from Ohio, is no more. Full of years, honored by the  confidence of the people, rich in large experience and ripened wisdom,  and devoted in all his affections and all his powers to his country,  and his whole country, he has been called from our midst at the very  moment when the prudence and patriotism of his counsels seemed most  needed. Such are the mysterious ways of Divine Providence. Judge  WRIGHT was born in Wethersfield, Connecticut, on the 10th of August,  1784. The death of his parents made him an orphan in infancy; and he  had little to depend upon in youth and early manhood, save his own  energies and God's blessing. He was married, while young, to a  daughter of Thomas Collier, of Litchfield, and for several years after  resided at Troy, New York. When about twenty-six years old he removed  to Steubenville, in Ohio, where he commenced the practice of the law,  and rapidly rose to distinction in the profession. In 1822 he was  elected a representative in Congress, where he became the associate  and friend of Clay and Webster, and proved himself, on many occasions,  worthy of their association and friendship.    After serving several terms in Congress, he was elected a Judge of the  Supreme Court of Ohio, and, in 1834, removed from Steubenville to the  city of Cincinnati. Resigning his seat soon afterwards, he resumed  the labors of the bar, and, ever zealous for the improvement and  elevation of the profession, established, in association with others,  the Cincinnati law school.    In 1840, upon the dying request of CHARLES HAMMOND, the veteran editor  of the \"Cincinnati Gazette,\" Judge WRIGHT assumed the editorial  control of that Journal, and retained that position until impaired  vision, in 1853, admonished him of the necessity of withdrawing from  labors too severe.    Thenceforward engaged in moderate labors, surrounded by affectionate  relatives, enjoying the respect and confidence of his fellow-citizens,  and manifesting always the liveliest concern in whatever related to  the welfare and honor of his State and his country, he lived in  tranquil retirement, until called by the Governor of Ohio, with the  approbation of the Senate, to take part in the deliberations of this  Conference Convention.    It was but a just tribute, sir, to his honored age, illustrated by  abilities, by virtues, and by services, that he was unanimously  selected as its temporary President. His interest in the great purpose  of our assembling was profound and earnest. His labors to promote an  auspicious result of its deliberations were active and constant. And  when fatal disease assailed his life, and his enfeebled powers yielded  to its virulence, his last utterances were of the Constitution and the  Union.    Mr. PRESIDENT, Judge WRIGHT was my friend. His approval cheered and  encouraged my own humble labors in the service of the State. Pardon me  if I mingle private with public grief. He has gone from his last great  labor. He was not permitted to witness upon earth the result of the  mission upon which he and his associates, who here mourn his loss,  were sent. God grant that the clouds which now darken over us may  speedily disperse, and that through generous counsels and patriotic  labors, guided by that good Providence which directed our fathers in  its original formation, the Union of our States may be more than ever  firmly cemented and established.    Mr. PRESIDENT, I offer the following resolutions:         _Resolved_, That in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24562"],[0,"The Panjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir (#7)"],[1," interest, including as it does at one end of the  scale Cambrian beds of enormous antiquity and at the other rocks of  Tertiary age. Embedded in the Cambrian strata there are great deposits  of rock salt at Kheora, where the Mayo mine is situated. At Kalabagh  the Salt Range reappears on the far side of the Indus. Here the salt  comes to the surface, and its jagged pinnacles present a remarkable  appearance.    ~Country north of the Salt Range.~--The country to the north of the Salt  Range included in the districts of Jhelam, Rawalpindi, and Attock is  often ravine-bitten and seamed with the white sandy beds of torrents.  Generally speaking it is an arid precarious tract, but there are fertile  stretches which will be mentioned in the descriptions of the districts.  The general height of the plains north of the Salt Range is from 1000  feet to 2000 feet above sea level. The rise between Lahore and  Rawalpindi is just over a thousand feet. Low hills usually form a  feature of the landscape, pleasing at a distance or when softened by the  evening light, but bare and jagged on a nearer view. The chief hills are  the Margalla range between Hazara and Rawalpindi, the Kalachitta and the  Khairimurat hills running east and west through Attock and the very dry  and broken Narrara hills on the right bank of the Indus in the same  district. Between the Margalla and Kalachitta hills is the Margalla pass  on the main road from Rawalpindi to the passage of the Indus at Attock,  and therefore a position of considerable strategical importance. The  Kalachitta (black and white) chain is so called because the north side  is formed of nummulitic limestone and the south mainly of a dark purple  sandstone. The best tree-growth is therefore on the north side.    ~Peshawar, Kohat, and Bannu.~--Across the Indus the Peshawar and Bannu  districts are basins ringed with hills and drained respectively by the  Kabul and Kurram rivers with their affluents. Between these two basins  lies the maze of bare broken hills and valleys which make up the Kohat  district. The cantonment of Kohat is 1700 feet above sea level and no  hill in the district reaches 5000 feet. Near the Kohat border in the  south-west of the Peshawar district are the Khattak hills, the  culmination of which at Ghaibana Sir has a height of 5136 feet, and the  military sanitarium of Cherat in the same chain is 600 feet lower. On  the east the Maidani hills part Bannu from Isakhel, the trans-Indus  _tahsil_ of Mianwali, and on the south the Marwat hills divide it from  Dera Ismail Khan. Both are humble ranges. The highest point in the  Marwat hills is Shekhbudin, a bare and dry limestone rock rising to an  elevation of over 4500 feet.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: They are held to be of Turkish origin.]          CHAPTER III    RIVERS      ~The Panjab Rivers.~--\"Panjab\" is a Persian compound word, meaning \"five  waters,\" and strictly speaking the word denotes the country between the  valley of the Jhelam and that of the Sutlej. The intermediate rivers  from west to east are the Chenab, the Ravi, and the Bias. Their combined  waters at last flow into the Panjnad or \"five rivers\" at the south-west  corner of the Multan district, and the volume of water which 44 miles  lower down the Panjnad carries into the Indus is equal to the discharge  of the latter. The first Aryan settlers knew this part of India as the  land of the seven rivers (_sapla sindhavas_), adding to the five  mentioned above the Indus and the Sarasvati. The old Vedic name is more  appropriate than Panjab if we substitute the Jamna for the Sarasvati or  Sarusti, which is now a petty stream.    [Illustration: Fig. 11. Panjab Rivers.]    ~River Valleys.~--The cold weather traveller who is carried from Delhi to  Rawalpindi over the great railway bridges at points chosen because there  the waters of the rivers are confined by nature, or can be confined by  art, within moderate limits, has little idea of what one of these rivers  is like in flood time. He sees that, even at such favoured spots,  between the low banks there is a stretch of sand far exceeding in width  the main channel, where a considerable volume of water is running, and  the minor depressions, in which a sluggish and shallow flow may still  be found. If, leaving the railway, he crosses a river by some bridge of  boats or local ferry, he will find still wider expanses of sand  sometimes bare and dry and white, at others moist and dark and covered  with dwarf tamarisk. He may notice that, before he reaches the sand and  the tamarisk scrub, he leaves by a gentle or abrupt descent the dry  uplands, and passes into a lower, greener, and perhaps to his  inexperienced eye more fertile seeming tract. This is the valley, often  miles broad, through which the stream has moved in ever-shifting  channels in the course of centuries. He finds it hard to realize that,  when the summer heats melt the Himalayan snows, and the monsoon  currents, striking against the northern mountain walls, are precipitated  in torrents of rain, the rush of water to the plains swells the river  20, 30, 40, or even 50 fold. The sandy bed then becomes full from bank  to bank, and the silt laden waters spill over into the cultivated  lowlands beyond. Accustomed to the stable streams of his own land, he  cannot conceive the risks the riverside farmer in the Panjab runs of  having fruitful fields smothered in a night with barren sand, or lands  and well and house sucked into the river-bed. So great and sudden are  the changes, bad and good, wrought by river action that the loss and  gain have to be measured up year by year for revenue purposes. Nor is  the visitor likely to imagine that the main channel may in a few seasons  become a quite subsidiary or wholly deserted bed. Like all streams, e.g.  the Po, which flow from the mountains into a flat terrain, the Panjab  rivers are perpetually silting up their beds, and thus, by their own  action, becoming diverted into new channels or into existing minor ones,  which are scoured out afresh. If our traveller, leaving the railway at  Rawalpindi, proceeds by tonga to the capital of Kashmir, he will find  between Kohala and Baramula another surprise awaiting him. The noble but  sluggish river of the lowlands, which he crossed at the town of Jhelam,  is here a swift and deep torrent, flowing over a boulder bed, and  swirling round waterworn rocks in a gorge hemmed in by mountains. That  is the typical state of the Himalayan rivers, though the same Jhelam  above Baramula is an exception, flowing there sluggishly through a very  flat valley into a shallow lake.    ~The Indus Basin.~--The river Sindh (Sanskrit, Sindhu), more familiar to  us under its classical name of the Indus, must have filled with  astonishment every invader from the west, and it is not wonderful that  they called after it the country that lay beyond. Its basin covers an  area of 373,000 square miles. Confining attention to Asia these figures,  large though they seem, are far exceeded by those of the Yangtsze-Kiang.  The area of which a description is attempted in this book is, with the  exception of a strip along the Jamna and the part of Kashmir lying  beyond the Muztagh-Karakoram range, all included in the Indus basin. But  it does not embrace the whole of it. Part is in Tibet, part in  Afghanistan and Biluchistan, and part in Sindh, through which province  the Indus flows for 450 miles, or one-quarter of its whole course of  1800 miles. It seems likely that the Jamna valley was not always an  exception, or at least that that river once flowed westwards through  Rajputana to the Indian ocean. The five great rivers of the Panjab all  drain into the Indus, and the Ghagar with its tributary, the Sarusti,  which now, even when in flood, loses itself in the sands of Bikaner,  probably once flowed down the old Hakra bed in Bahawalpur either into  the Indus or by an independent bed now represented by an old flood  channel of the Indus in Sindh, the Hakro or Nara, which passes through  the Rann of Kachh.    ~The Indus outside British India.~--To the north of the Manasarowar lake  in Tibet is Kailas, the Hindu Olympus. On the side of this mountain the  Indus is said to rise at a height of 17,000 feet. After a course of 200  miles or more it crosses the south-east boundary of the Kashmir State at  an elevation of 13,800 feet. From the Kashmir frontier to Mt Haramosh  west of Gilgit it flows steadily to the north-west for 350 miles. After  125 miles Leh, the capital of Ladakh, is reached at a height of 10,500  feet, and here the river is crossed by the trade route to Yarkand. A  little below Leh the Indus receives the Zanskar, which drains the  south-east of Kashmir. After another 150 miles it flows through the  basin, in which Skardo, the principal town in Baltistan, is situated.  Above Skardo a large tributary, the Shyok, flows in from the east at an  elevation of 8000 feet. The Shyok and its affluent, the Nubra, rise in  the giant glaciers to the south-west of the Karakoram pass. After the  Skardo basin is left behind the descent is rapid. The river rushes down  a tremendous gorge, where it appears to break through the western  Himalaya, skirts Haramosh, and at a point twenty-five miles east of  Gilgit bends abruptly to the south. Shortly after it is joined from the  west by the Gilgit river, and here the bed is about 4000 feet above sea  level. Continuing to flow south for another twenty miles it resumes its  westernly course to the north of Nanga Parvat and persists in it for 100  miles. Our political post of Chilas lies in this section on the south  bank. Fifty or sixty miles west of Chilas the Indus turns finally to the  south. From Jalkot, where the Kashmir frontier is left, to Palosi below  the Mahaban mountain it flows for a hundred miles through territory over  which we only exercise political control. Near Palosi, 812 miles from  the source, the river enters British India."]]]
