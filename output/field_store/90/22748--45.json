On  a very fine night, without a moon, perhaps a dozen might be perceived,  or even more, according to the keenness of the eyesight. But when the  opera-glass is directed to the same part of the constellation an  astonishing sight is witnessed. A hundred stars can now be seen with the  greatest ease.    But the opera-glass will not show nearly all the stars in this region.  Any good telescope will reveal many hundreds too faint for the feebler  instrument. The greater the telescope the more numerous the stars: so  that seen through one of the colossal instruments the number would have  to be reckoned in thousands.    We have chosen the Great Bear because it is more generally known than  any other constellation. But the Great Bear is not exceptionally rich in  stars. To tell the number of the stars is a task which no man has  accomplished; but various estimates have been made. Our great telescopes  can probably show at least 50,000,000 stars.    The student who uses a good refracting telescope, having an object-glass  not less than three inches in diameter, will find occupation for many a  fine evening. It will greatly increase the interest of his work if he  have the charming handbook of the heavens known as Webb's \"Celestial  Objects for Common Telescopes.\"          CHAPTER II.

In commencing our examination of the orbs which surround us, we  naturally begin with our peerless sun. His splendid brilliance gives him  the pre-eminence over all other celestial bodies.    The dimensions of our luminary are commensurate with his importance.  Astronomers have succeeded in the difficult task of ascertaining the  exact figures, but they are so gigantic that the results are hard to  realise. The diameter of the orb of day, or the length of the axis,  passing through the centre from one side to the other, is 866,000 miles.  Yet this bare statement of the dimensions of the great globe fails to  convey an adequate idea of its vastness. If a railway were laid round  the sun, and if we were to start in an express train moving sixty miles  an hour, we should have to travel for five years without intermission  night or day before we had accomplished the journey.    When the sun is compared with the earth the bulk of our luminary becomes  still more striking. Suppose his globe were cut up into one million  parts, each of these parts would appreciably exceed the bulk of our  earth. Fig. 10 exhibits a large circle and a very small one, marked S  and E respectively. These circles show the comparative sizes of the two  bodies. The mass of the sun does not, however, exceed that of the earth  in the same proportion. Were the sun placed in one pan of a mighty  weighing balance, and were 300,000 bodies as heavy as our earth placed  in the other, the luminary would turn the scale.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Comparative Size of the Earth and the Sun.]    The sun has a temperature far surpassing any that we artificially  produce, either in our chemical laboratories or our metallurgical  establishments. We can send a galvanic current through a piece of  platinum wire. The wire first becomes red hot, then white hot; then it  glows with a brilliance almost dazzling until it fuses and breaks. The  temperature of the melting platinum wire could hardly be surpassed in  the most elaborate furnaces, but it does not attain the temperature of  the sun.    It must, however, be admitted that there is an apparent discrepancy  between a fact of common experience and the statement that the sun  possesses the extremely high temperature that we have just tried to  illustrate. \"If the sun were hot,\" it has been said, \"then the nearer we  approach to him the hotter we should feel; yet this does not seem to be  the case. On the top of a high mountain we are nearer to the sun, and  yet everybody knows that it is much colder up there than in the valley  beneath. If the mountain be as high as Mont Blanc, then we are certainly  two or three miles nearer the glowing globe than we were at the  sea-level; yet, instead of additional warmth, we find eternal snow.\" A  simple illustration may help to lessen this difficulty. In a greenhouse  on a sunshiny day the temperature is much hotter than it is outside. The  glass will permit the hot sunbeams to enter, but it refuses to allow  them out again with equal freedom, and consequently the temperature  rises. The earth may, from this point of view, be likened to a  greenhouse, only, instead of the panes of glass, our globe is enveloped  by an enormous coating of air. On the earth's surface, we stand, as it  were, inside the greenhouse, and we benefit by the interposition of the  atmosphere; but when we climb very high mountains, we gradually pass  through some of the protecting medium, and then we suffer from the cold.  If the earth were deprived of its coat of air, it seems certain that  eternal frost would reign over whole continents as well as on the tops  of the mountains.    The actual distance of the sun from the earth is about 92,900,000 miles;  but by merely reciting the figures we do not receive a vivid impression  of the real magnitude. It would be necessary to count as quickly as  possible for three days and three nights before one million was  completed; yet this would have to be repeated nearly ninety-three times  before we had counted all the miles between the earth and the sun.    Every clear night we see a vast host of stars scattered over the sky.  Some are bright, some are faint, some are grouped into remarkable forms.  With regard to this multitude of brilliant points we have now to ask an  important question. Are they bodies which shine by their own light like  the sun, or do they only shine with borrowed light like the moon? The  answer is easily stated. Most of those bodies shine by their own light,  and they are properly called _stars_.    Suppose that the sun and the multitude of stars, properly so called, are  each and all self-luminous brilliant bodies, what is the great  distinction between the sun and the stars? There is, of course, a vast  and obvious difference between the unrivalled splendour of the sun and  the feeble twinkle of the stars. Yet this distinction does not  necessarily indicate that our luminary has an intrinsic splendour  superior to that of the stars. The fact is that we are nestled up  comparatively close to the sun for the benefit of his warmth and light,  while we are separated from even the nearest of the stars by a mighty  abyss. If the sun were gradually to retreat from the earth, his light  would decrease, so that when he had penetrated the depths of space to a  distance comparable with that by which we are separated from the stars,  his glory would have utterly departed. No longer would the sun seem to  be the majestic orb with which we are familiar. No longer would he be a  source of genial heat, or a luminary to dispel the darkness of night.  Our great sun would have shrunk to the insignificance of a star, not so  bright as many of those which we see every night.    Momentous indeed is the conclusion to which we are now led. That myriad  host of stars which studs our sky every night has been elevated into  vast importance. Each one of those stars is itself a mighty sun,  actually rivalling, and in many cases surpassing, the splendour of our  own luminary. We thus open up a majestic conception of the vast  dimensions of space, and of the dignity and splendour of the myriad  globes by which that space is tenanted.    There is another aspect of the picture not without its utility. We must  from henceforth remember that our sun is only a star, and not a  particularly important star. If the sun and the earth, and all which it  contains, were to vanish, the effect in the universe would merely be  that a tiny star had ceased its twinkling. Viewed simply as a star, the  sun must retire to a position of insignificance in the mighty fabric of  the universe. But it is not as a star that we have to deal with the sun.  To us his comparative proximity gives him an importance incalculably  transcending that of all the other stars. We imagined ourselves to be  withdrawn from the sun to obtain his true perspective in the universe;  let us now draw near, and give him that attention which his supreme  importance to us merits.    [Illustration: Fig. 11.--The Sun, photographed on September 22, 1870.]    To the unaided eye the sun appears to be a flat circle. If, however, it  be examined with the telescope, taking care of course to interpose a  piece of dark-coloured glass, or to employ some similar precaution to  screen the eye from injury, it will then be perceived that the sun is  not a flat surface, but a veritable glowing globe.    The first question which we must attempt to answer enquires whether the  glowing matter which forms the globe is a solid mass, or, if not solid,  which is it, liquid or gaseous? At the first glance we might think that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2742"],[0,"Cenci (#7)"],[1,"Rome--    \"Signor Bernardo Cenci, in the name of our blessed Redeemer, our Holy  Father the Pope spares your life; with the sole condition that you  accompany your relatives to the scaffold and to their death, and never  forget to pray for those with whom you were condemned to die.\"    At this unexpected intelligence, a loud murmur of joy spread among the  crowd, and the members of the Confraternity immediately untied the small  mask which covered the youth's eyes; for, owing to his tender age, it  had been thought proper to conceal the scaffold from his sight.    Then the executioner; having disposed of Giacomo, came down from the  cart to take Bernardo; whose pardon being formally communicated to him,  he took off his handcuffs, and placed him alongside his brother,  covering him up with a magnificent cloak embroidered with gold, for the  neck and shoulders of the poor lad had been already bared, as a  preliminary to his decapitation. People were surprised to see such a  rich cloak in the possession of the executioner, but were told that it  was the one given by Beatrice to Marzio to pledge him to the murder of  her father, which fell to the executioner as a perquisite after the  execution of the assassin. The sight of the great assemblage of people  produced such an effect upon the boy that he fainted.    The procession then proceeded to the prison of Corte Savella, marching  to the sound of funeral chants. At its gates the sacred crucifix halted  for the women to join: they soon appeared, fell on their knees, and  worshipped the holy symbol as the others had done. The march to the  scaffold was then resumed.    The two female prisoners followed the last row of penitents in single  file, veiled to the waist, with the distinction that Lucrezia, as a  widow, wore a black veil and high-heeled slippers of the same hue, with  bows of ribbon, as was the fashion; whilst Beatrice, as a young  unmarried girl, wore a silk flat cap to match her corsage, with a plush  hood, which fell over her shoulders and covered her violet frock; white  slippers with high heels, ornamented with gold rosettes and  cherry-coloured fringe. The arms of both were untrammelled, except far a  thin slack cord which left their hands free to carry a crucifix and a  handkerchief.    During the night a lofty scaffold had been erected on the bridge of  Sant' Angelo, and the plank and block were placed thereon. Above the  block was hung, from a large cross beam, a ponderous axe, which, guided  by two grooves, fell with its whole weight at the touch of a spring.    In this formation the procession wended its way towards the bridge of  Sant' Angela. Lucrezia, the more broken down of the two, wept bitterly;  but Beatrice was firm and unmoved. On arriving at the open space before  the bridge, the women were led into a chapel, where they were shortly  joined by Giacomo and Bernardo; they remained together for a few  moments, when the brothers were led away to the scaffold, although one  was to be executed last, and the other was pardoned. But when they had  mounted the platform, Bernardo fainted a second time; and as the  executioner was approaching to his assistance, some of the crowd,  supposing that his object was to decapitate him, cried loudly, \"He is  pardoned!\" The executioner reassured them by seating Bernardo near the  block, Giacomo kneeling on the other side.    Then the executioner descended, entered the chapel, and reappeared  leading Lucrezia, who was the first to suffer. At the foot of the  scaffold he tied her hands behind her back, tore open the top of her  corsage so as to uncover her shoulders, gave her the crucifix to kiss,  and led her to the step ladder, which she ascended with great  difficulty, on account of her extreme stoutness; then, on her reaching  the platform, he removed the veil which covered her head. On this  exposure of her features to the immense crowd, Lucrezia shuddered from  head to foot; then, her eyes full of tears, she cried with a loud  voice--    \"O my God, have mercy upon me; and do you, brethren, pray for my soul!\"    Having uttered these words, not knowing what was required of her, she  turned to Alessandro, the chief executioner, and asked what she was to  do; he told her to bestride the plank and lie prone upon it; which she  did with great trouble and timidity; but as she was unable, on account  of the fullness of her bust, to lay her neck upon the block, this had to  be raised by placing a billet of wood underneath it; all this time the  poor woman, suffering even more from shame than from fear, was kept in  suspense; at length, when she was properly adjusted, the executioner  touched the spring, the knife fell, and the decapitated head, falling on  the platform of the scaffold, bounded two or three times in the air, to  the general horror; the executioner then seized it, showed it to the  multitude, and wrapping it in black taffetas, placed it with the body on  a bier at the foot of the scaffold.    Whilst arrangements were being made for the decapitation of Beatrice,  several stands, full of spectators, broke down; some people were killed  by this accident, and still more lamed and injured.    The machine being now rearranged and washed, the executioner returned to  the chapel to take charge of Beatrice, who, on seeing the sacred  crucifix, said some prayers for her soul, and on her hands being tied,  cried out, \"God grant that you be binding this body unto corruption, and  loosing this soul unto life eternal!\" She then arose, proceeded to the  platform, where she devoutly kissed the stigmata; then leaving her  slippers at the foot of the scaffold, she nimbly ascended the ladder,  and instructed beforehand, promptly lay down on the plank, without  exposing her naked shoulders. But her precautions to shorten the  bitterness of death were of no avail, for the pope, knowing her  impetuous disposition, and fearing lest she might be led into the  commission of some sin between absolution and death, had given orders  that the moment Beatrice was extended on the scaffold a signal gun  should be fired from the castle of Sant' Angelo; which was done, to the  great astonishment of everybody, including Beatrice herself, who, not  expecting this explosion, raised herself almost upright; the pope  meanwhile, who was praying at Monte Cavallo, gave her absolution 'in  articulo mortis'. About five minutes thus passed, during which the  sufferer waited with her head replaced on the block; at length, when the  executioner judged that the absolution had been given, he released the  spring, and the axe fell.    A gruesome sight was then afforded: whilst the head bounced away on one  side of the block, on the other the body rose erect, as if about to step  backwards; the executioner exhibited the head, and disposed of it and  the body as before. He wished to place Beatrice's body with that of her  stepmother, but the brotherhood of Mercy took it out of his hands, and  as one of them was attempting to lay it on the bier, it slipped from him  and fell from the scaffold to the ground below; the dress being  partially torn from the body, which was so besmeared with dust and blood  that much time was occupied in washing it. Poor Bernardo was so overcome  by this horrible scene that he swooned away for the third time, and it  was necessary to revive him with stimulants to witness the fate of his  elder brother.    The turn of Giacomo at length arrived: he had witnessed the death of his  stepmother and his sister, and his clothes were covered with their  blood; the executioner approached him and tore off his cloak, exposing  his bare breast covered with the wounds caused by the grip of red-hot  pincers; in this state, and half-naked, he rose to his feet, and turning  to his brother, said--    \"Bernardo, if in my examination I have compromised and accused you, I  have done so falsely, and although I have already disavowed this  declaration, I repeat, at the moment of appearing before God, that you  are innocent, and that it is a cruel abuse of justice to compel you to  witness this frightful spectacle.\"    The executioner then made him kneel down, bound his legs to one of the  beams erected on the scaffold, and having bandaged his eyes, shattered  his head with a blow of his mallet; then, in the sight of all, he hacked  his body into four quarters. The official party then left, taking with  them Bernardo, who, being in a state of high fever, was bled and put to  bed.    The corpses of the two ladies were laid out each on its bier under the  statue of St. Paul, at the foot of the bridge, with four torches of  white wax, which burned till four o'clock in the afternoon; then, along  with the remains of Giacomo, they were taken to the church of San  Giovanni Decollato; finally, about nine in the evening, the body of  Beatrice, covered with flowers, and attired in the dress worn at her  execution, was carried to the church of San Pietro in Montorio, with  fifty lighted torches, and followed by the brethren of the order of the  Stigmata and all the Franciscan monks in Rome; there, agreeably to her  wish, it was buried at the foot of the high altar.    The same evening Signora Lucrezia was interred, as she had desired to  be, in the church of San Giorgio di Velobre.    All Rome may be said to have been present at this tragedy, carriages,  horses, foot people, and cars crowding as it were upon one another. The  day was unfortunately so hot, and the sun so scorching, that many  persons fainted, others returned home stricken with fever, and some even  died during the night, owing to sunstroke from exposure during the three  hours occupied by the execution.    The Tuesday following, the 14th of September; being the Feast of the  Holy Cross, the brotherhood of San Marcello, by special licence of the  pope, set at liberty the unhappy Bernardo Cenci, with the condition of  paying within the year two thousand five hundred Roman crowns to"]]]
