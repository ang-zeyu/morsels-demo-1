Then the daughter went to ask the  nobleman's consent.    \"Have you really the courage to watch for a whole night in a room  haunted by ghosts? Are you sure you are not afraid, my good girl?\"    \"I am willing to try this very night,\" she replied. \"I would only ask  you to give me some food to cook for my supper, for I am very hungry.\"    Orders were given that she should be supplied with everything she  wanted, and indeed enough food was given her, not for one supper only,  but for three. With the food, some dry firewood and a candle, she  entered the room. Like a good housewife, she first lit the fire and  put on her saucepans, then she laid the table and made the bed. This  filled up the early part of the evening. The time passed so quickly  that she was surprised to hear the clock strike twelve, while at the  last stroke, footsteps, as of some one walking, shook the room, and  dismal groans filled the air. The frightened girl ran from one corner  to the other, but could not see any one. But the footsteps and the  groans did not cease. Suddenly a young man approached her and asked,  \"For whom is this food cooked?\"    \"For myself,\" she said.    The gentle face of the stranger saddened, and after a short silence he  asked again, \"And this table, for whom is it laid?\"    \"For myself,\" she replied.    The brow of the young man clouded over, and the beautiful blue eyes  filled with tears as he asked once more, \"And this bed, for whom have  you made it?\"    \"For myself,\" replied she in the same selfish and indifferent tone.    Tears fell from his eyes as he waved his arms and vanished.    Next morning she told the nobleman all that had happened, but without  mentioning the painful impression her answers had made upon the  stranger. The three hundred golden crowns were paid, and the father  was thankful to have at last heard something that might possibly lead  to the discovery of his son.    On the following day the second daughter, having been told by her  sister what to do and how to answer the stranger, went to the castle  to offer her services. The nobleman willingly agreed, and orders were  given that she should be provided with everything she might want.  Without loss of time she entered the room, lit the fire, put on the  saucepans, spread a white cloth upon the table, made the bed, and  awaited the hour of midnight. When the young stranger appeared and  asked, \"For whom is this food prepared? for whom is the table laid?  for whom is the bed made?\" she answered as her sister had bidden her,  \"For me, for myself only.\"    As on the night before, he burst into tears, waved his arms, and  suddenly disappeared.    Next morning she told the nobleman all that had happened except the  sad impression her answers had made upon the stranger. The three  hundred gold pieces were given her, and she went home.    On the third day the youngest daughter wanted to try her fortune.    \"Sisters,\" said she, \"as you have succeeded in earning three hundred  gold crowns each, and so helping our dear mother, I too should like to  do my part and remain a night in the haunted room.\"    [Illustration]    Now the widow loved her youngest daughter more dearly than the others,  and dreaded to expose her to any danger; but as the elder ones had  been successful, she allowed her to take her chance. So with the  instructions from her sisters as to what she should do and say, and  with the nobleman's consent and abundant provisions, she entered the  haunted room. Having lit the fire, put on the saucepans, laid the  table and made the bed, she awaited with hope and fear the hour of  midnight.    As twelve o'clock struck, the room was shaken by the footsteps of some  one who walked up and down, and the air was filled with cries and  groans. The girl looked everywhere, but no living being could she see.  Suddenly there stood before her a young man who asked in a sweet  voice, \"For whom have you prepared this food?\"    Now her sisters had told her how to answer and how to act, but when  she looked into the sad eyes of the stranger she resolved to treat him  more kindly.    \"Well, you do not answer me; for whom is the food prepared?\" he asked  again impatiently, as she made no reply. Somewhat confused, she said,  \"I prepared it for myself, but you too are welcome to it.\"    At these words his brow grew more serene.    \"And this table, for whom is it spread?\"    \"For myself, unless you will honour me by being my guest.\"    A bright smile illumined his face.    \"And this bed, for whom have you made it?\"    \"For myself, but if you have need of rest it is for you.\"    He clapped his hands for joy and replied, \"Ah, that's right; I accept  the invitation with pleasure, and all that you have been so kind as to  offer me. But wait, I pray you wait for me; I must first thank my kind  friends for the care they have taken of me.\"    A fresh warm breath of spring filled the air, while at the same moment  a deep precipice opened in the middle of the floor. He descended  lightly, and she, anxious to see what would happen, followed him,  holding on to his mantle. Thus they both reached the bottom of the  precipice. Down there a new world opened itself before her eyes. To  the right flowed a river of liquid gold, to the left rose high  mountains of solid gold, in the centre lay a large meadow covered with  millions of flowers. The stranger went on, the girl followed  unnoticed. And as he went he saluted the field flowers as old friends,  caressing them and leaving them with regret. Then they came to a  forest where the trees were of gold. Many birds of different kinds  began to sing, and flying round the young stranger perched familiarly  on his head and shoulders. He spoke to and petted each one. While thus  engaged, the girl broke off a branch from one of the golden trees and  hid it in remembrance of this strange land.    Leaving the forest of gold, they reached a wood where all the trees  were of silver. Their arrival was greeted by an immense number of  animals of various kinds. These crowded together and pushed one  against another to get close to their friend. He spoke to each one and  stroked and petted them. Meanwhile the girl broke off a branch of  silver from one of the trees, saying to herself, \"These will serve me  as tokens of this wonderful land, for my sisters would not believe me  if I only told them of it.\"    [Illustration]    When the young stranger had taken leave of all his friends he returned  by the paths he had come, and the girl followed without being seen.  Arrived at the foot of the precipice, he began to ascend, she coming  silently after, holding on to his mantle. Up they went higher and  higher, until they reached the room in the castle. The floor closed up  without trace of the opening. The girl returned to her place by the  fire, where she was standing when the young man approached.    \"All my farewells have been spoken,\" said he, \"now we can have  supper.\"    She hastened to place upon the table the food so hurriedly prepared,  and sitting side by side they supped together. When they had made a  good meal he said, \"Now it is time to rest.\"    He lay down on the carefully-made bed, and the girl placed by his side  the gold and silver branches she had picked in the Mineral Land. In a  few moments he was sleeping peacefully.    Next day the sun was already high in the sky, and yet the girl had not  come to give an account of herself. The nobleman became impatient; he  waited and waited, becoming more and more uneasy. At last he  determined to go and see for himself what had happened. Picture to  yourself his surprise and joy, when on entering the haunted chamber he  saw his long-lost son sleeping on the bed, while beside him sat the  widow's beautiful daughter. At that moment the son awoke. The father,  overwhelmed with joy, summoned the attendants of the castle to rejoice  with him in his new-found happiness.    Then the young man saw the two branches of metal, and said with  astonishment, \"What do I see? Did you then follow me down there? Know  that by this act you have broken the spell and released me from the  enchantment. These two branches will make two palaces for our future  dwelling.\"    Thereupon he took the branches and threw them out of the window.  Immediately there were seen two magnificent palaces, one of gold, the  other of silver. And there they lived happily as man and wife, the  nobleman's son and the miller's daughter. And if not dead they live  there still.          THE MAID WITH HAIR OF GOLD          [Illustration]    THE MAID WITH HAIR OF GOLD      There was once a king so wise and clever that he understood the  language of all animals. You shall hear how he gained this power.    One day an old woman came to the palace and said, \"I wish to speak to  his majesty, for I have something of great importance to tell him.\"  When admitted to his presence she presented him with a curious fish,  saying, \"Have it cooked for yourself, and when you have eaten it you  will understand all that is said by the birds of the air, the animals  that walk the earth, and the fishes that live under the waters.\"    The king was delighted to know that which every one else was ignorant  of, so he rewarded the old woman generously, and told a servant to  cook the fish very carefully.    \"But take care,\" said the monarch, \"that you do not taste it yourself,  for if you do you will be killed.\"    George, the servant, was astonished at such a threat, and wondered why  his master was so anxious that no one else should eat any of the fish.  Then examining it curiously he said, \"Never in all my life have I seen  such an odd-looking fish; it seems more like a reptile. Now where  would be the harm if I did take some? Every cook tastes of the dishes  he prepares.\"    When it was fried he tasted a small piece, and while taking some of  the sauce heard a buzzing in the air and a voice speaking in his ear.    \"Let us taste a crumb: "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25568"],[0,"Domesticated Animals (#7)"],[1,"in monkeys and perhaps even in the more intelligent horses,  but nowhere else save in man, and hardly there, except in the more  sensitive natures, do we find contempt, expressed in laughter of the  kind which conveys that emotion, so keenly and painfully appreciated.  With those dogs which are endowed with a large human quality, such as  our various breeds of hounds, it is possible by laughing in their faces  not only to quell their rage, but to drive them to a distance. They  seem in a way to be put to shame and at the same time hopelessly  puzzled as to the nature of their predicament. In this connection we  may note the very human feature that after you have cowed a dog by  insistent laughter you can never hope to make friends with him. A case  of this kind is fresh in my experience. A year or two ago I was  imprudent enough to laugh at a very intelligent dog in my neighborhood,  he having unreasonably assailed me at my house-door, where he had been  left for a long time to wait while his owner was within and had thereby  been brought into an unhappy state of mind. Sympathizing with his  situation, I preferred to laugh him out of his humor rather than to  beat him with my stick. I regret I did not take the other alternative,  for I made the poor brute my implacable enemy by my pretence of  contempt for him. I am inclined to think that if I had beaten him the  matter could have been arranged afterward in a friendly way.    [Illustration: The Pounce of a Terrier]    Another very remarkable and I believe hitherto unnoticed likeness  between the mind of dogs and that of man is found in the fact that  these dumb beasts, unlike all other inferior animals, except, perhaps,  some of the more intelligent species of monkeys, will learn lessons  from isolated experiences. In this regard they are indeed quite as apt  as the lower kinds of men. Thus a dog who has had an unsavory or  painful experience with a skunk or a porcupine is apt to keep away  from these creatures for a long time thereafter. Where, as is not  infrequently the case, a cur takes to eating eggs, a single dose of  tartar emetic concealed in an egg which is placed where he can readily  find it, is apt to effect an immediate and complete reform. This ready  learning from experience is almost the gist of our human quality--at  least on the intellectual side of it.    Perhaps the greatest success to which man has attained in his education  of the dog is to be found in the measure in which he has overcome the  fierce rage which clearly characterized the ancestors of this creature  when they first felt the mastering hand. The reader cannot understand  the intensity of the rage motive in the carnivora unless he has studied  some of these brutes in their wild state, where from the time in the  remote ages when they first began to take on the qualities of their  species they have survived and won success by the fury of their assault.  In almost all our breeds of dogs this primal ferocity has been overlaid  by the various motives of rationality, sympathy, and conventional  demeanor, until one may live half a lifetime with well-bred dogs without  a chance to see the demon which we have buried in their breasts, as we  have in our own, beneath a host of civilizing influences. It is rare  indeed in our day that a dog, unless insane, will bite a human being.  The most of their assaults are pure bluster, mere pretence of fury, as  is shown by the fact that if, carried away by their pretence, they are  led to use their teeth, it is usually a mere sham assault, having no  semblance of the effectiveness of true combat.    Something of the pristine fury of the primitive dogs may still be noted  in a certain brutal variety of watch-dogs which are still to be found in  parts of continental Europe. The best types of this breed which I have  ever seen are to be found among the dogs which are kept to guard the  quarries of Solenhofen, in Bavaria, whence come all the fine  lithographic stones which are so extensively used in printing. These  quarries are scattered over several square miles of untilled country,  and the separate pits are to be numbered by the score. As much valuable  stone is necessarily left over night in the quarries, their care is  confined to packs of watch-dogs which are turned loose at night and  appear as if by instinct to spend the hours of darkness in prowling over  the territory. Such is their size and ferocity that it takes a sturdy  beggar to face them. I remember inadvertently disturbing one of these  brutes from sleep, in the strong cage where he was confined, and I have  never beheld such a picture of blind fury as he exhibited. I had not  come within twenty feet of him, and was merely moving past his place of  confinement; yet he sprang to the grating and strove with his teeth to  break his way through the bars. I thought the animal must be mad, but  his keeper assured me that such was his ordinary state of mind and that  the humor was common to all the breed; even the masters dwelt in fear of  them. Ordinarily the only exhibitions of the innate ferocity of our dogs  are to be seen in their combats with each other, when for a time the  creatures return to their primitive state of mind. Even these occasional  exhibitions of fury are not found among all breeds of dogs, and among  many individuals even of the combative strains of blood the motive of  battle appears to have quite passed away.    [Illustration: Pomeranian or \"Spitz\"]    In antithesis to the old Ishmaelitic humor of our primitive dogs, man  has developed a singular, sympathetic, and kindly motive in these  creatures. From the point of view of the dog's education we must not  set too much store by his affection for his master. This kind of  devotion of one being to another is displayed elsewhere in the animal  kingdom, though it is more common among birds than among mammals. We  find traces of it in the greater part of our domesticated creatures or  in those which we have individually adopted from the wilderness. It is a  part of the great sympathetic motive, which, originating far down in the  series of animals, increases as they gain in the scale of being, until  it reaches the highest level it has yet attained in spiritually minded  men. The eminent peculiarity in the case of a dog is that the very  centre of his life is formed of the affections, which are evidently the  same as those which rule the days of the most cultivated men. To him  these elements of friendliness are absolutely necessary to a comfortable  existence. If by chance he becomes separated from his master and the  other people with whom he is familiar, his bereavement is intense; but  in most cases, at the end of a day or two, he is compelled to form new  bonds, and he sets about the task in an exceedingly human way. I dwell  in a town where dogs abound and where the frequent coming and going of  the people puts many of the creatures astray. Perhaps as often as once a  week, almost always late in the evening, one of these unhappy lost ones  seeks to make friends with me. His advances toward this end always begin  by his dogging my footsteps at a little distance. If I do not repulse  him he will come nearer until he has made sure of my attention. A  friendly word will bring him to my hand; but his behavior is never  effusive, as it would be if he had found his rightful owner, but mildly  propitiative and with a touch of sadness. There is, it seems to me, no  other feature in the life of the dog which tells so much as to his moral  nature as his conduct under these unhappy circumstances.    [Illustration: Poodles]    In the long catalogue of human qualities which characterize our  thoroughly domesticated dogs, we must not fail to take account of  their sense of property. In this the creature differs from all other  of our domesticated animals. It is a common characteristic of mammals,  both in their wild and tame state, that they feel a motive of  ownership in the food which they have captured or in the den which  they have made their lair; but beyond these narrow personal limits we  see no evidence of any sense of ownership in land or effects. We  readily observe, however, that our household dogs not only know the  chattels of their master and distinguish them from those of other  people, but they also learn to recognize the bounds of their house-lot  or even of a considerable farm. When a dog, even of a militant  quality, enters on territory which he does not feel to belong to him,  he is at once a very different creature as compared to his condition  when he is on his own land. He treads warily and will accept without  dispute an order to take himself off. A perception of this sort  indicates an extraordinary amount of sympathy and discernment. It  requires us to assume that the creature has a good sense of topography  and that he observes closely the various acts, none of them perhaps  very indicative, which go to show the limits of his master's claims.    Although the mental qualities of our highly domesticated dogs are  singularly like those of their masters, the likeness going to the  point that the household pet is apt to have acquired something of the  general character of the people with whom he dwells, there are many  suggestive differences arising from failures of development which are  in the highest measure interesting to those who study the species. We  note, in the first place, that although for ages in contact with the  constructive work which occupies his masters, the dog shows no  tendency whatever to essay any undertakings of this nature. He is  quite alive to considerations of personal comfort and is particularly  fond of a warm bed; yet, except for a few unverified stories, we may  say that there is no evidence whatever to show that they ever try to  improve their conditions by deliberately providing themselves with warm  bedding. In no well-attested case has a dog shown any sense as to"]]]
