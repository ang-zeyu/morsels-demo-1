I would call attention to the piece of solid brimstone so persistently  put into dogs' water pans. It is placed there with the best intention,  but is utterly useless, seeing it is a perfectly insoluble substance,  but a small teaspoonful of powdered brimstone mixed now and then with  the water would be lapped up when the animal drinks, and would tend to  keep his skin and coat in good condition.    Different animals need treating according to their nature and  requirements, and surely it is well to try and find out from some of the  many charming books on natural history all the information which is  needed to make the new pet happy in its captivity. It is both useless  and cruel to try to keep and tame newly caught, full-grown English  birds. After being used to their joyous life amongst tree branches, in  happy fellowship with others of their own kind, living on food of their  own selection, it is hardly likely they can be reconciled to the narrow  limits of a cage and the dreariness of a solitary life; it is far better  not to attempt keeping them, for what pleasure can there be in seeing  the incessant flutterings of a miserable little creature that we know is  breaking its heart in longings for liberty, and though it may linger a  while is sure to die at last of starvation and sorrow. No, the only way  to enjoy friendships with full-grown birds is to tame them by food and  kindness, till such a tie of love is formed that they will come into our  houses and give us their sweet company willingly.    No cruelty of any kind whatever should be tolerated for a moment in our  treatment of the tender dumb creatures our Heavenly Father has given us  to be a solace and joy during our life on earth.    The taming of pets requires a good many different qualities--much  patience, a very quiet manner, and a cheery way of talking to the little  creatures we desire to win into friendship with us; it is wonderful how  that prevents needless terrors.    There are no secrets that I am aware of in taming anything, but love and  gentleness. Directly a bird flutters, one must stop and speak kindly;  the human voice has wonderful power over all animated nature, and then  try to see what is the cause of alarm, and remove it if possible. In  entering a room where your pet is, always speak to it, and by the time  you have led it to give an answering chirp, the taming will go on  rapidly, because there is an understanding between you, and the little  lonely bird feels it has a friend, and takes you instead of its  feathered companions, and begins to delight in your company.    A person going silently to a cage and dragging out the bottom tray will  frighten any bird into flutterings of alarm, which effectually hinders  any taming going on; but approach gently, talking to the bird by name,  pull the tray quietly a little way, and then stop and speak, and so draw  it out by degrees and the thing is done, and no fright experienced. A  better way still is to have a second cage, and let birdie hop into that  while you clean the other, and then it is amusing to see the pleasure  and curiosity shown on his return when he finds fresh seed, pure water,  and some dainty green food supplied; the loud chirpings tell of great  delight and satisfaction, and the dreaded process is at last looked  forward to as a time of recreation. It is much best that one person only  should attend to the needs of a pet; indeed, I doubt if taming can ever  go on satisfactorily unless this rule is observed; a bird is perplexed  and scared if plans are changed, and, not knowing what is required of  him, he grows flurried, and the training of weeks past may be undone in  a single day.    Only those who have tried to educate birds can have any idea of the way  in which their little minds will respond to affectionate treatment shown  in a sensible way. They have a language of their own which we must set  ourselves to learn if we would be _en rapport_ with them. Their  different chirpings each mean something, and a little observation will  soon show what it is; for instance, my canary fairly shrieks when she  sees lettuce on the breakfast-table, and her grateful note of thanks  when it is bestowed upon her is of quite a different character. So also  is her tender little sound of rejoicing when I give her some broken  egg-shell; she seems to value it immensely, and chirps to me with a  great piece of it in her bill, quite regardless of good manners. I often  think with pain how much birds must suffer when hour after hour they  call and chirp and entreat for something they want, which they can see  and long for, and yet the dull-minded human beings they live with pay no  heed to them, food and water are given, but, in many cases, nothing more  all day long, not even a little chickweed or groundsel, or the  much-needed egg-shell to supply strength to their little bones. A bright  word or two for birdie now and then, and a few friendly chirps as we  enter the room, would do much to cheer the little prisoner's life, and  would soon bring a charming response in fluttering wings and evident  pleasure at our return.    This state of things cannot be attained in a day or a month; it is only  by persistent kindness, exercised patiently, until the little heart is  won to a perfect trust in you as a true friend.    Birds can easily be trained to come out for their daily bath, and then  go back to their cage of their own accord, but it needs patience at  first. The bird must never be caught by the hand or driven about, but if  the cage is put on the floor with some nice food in it, and the bird is  called and gently guided to it, though it may take an hour to do it the  first time, it will at last hop in, and then the door may be very  quietly shut. Next time he will know what you wish and will be much more  amenable, until at last it will be the regular thing to go home when the  bath is over.    I would condemn the practice of making birds draw up their own water;  they are never free to satisfy their thirst without toilsome effort, and  are much more liable to accident when chained to an open board than when  kept in a cage. It is also sad to know that dozens of birds are starved  to death or die of thirst whilst being taught this trick--frequently but  one out of many is found to have the aptitude to learn it.    It is a great help if some specially favourite food can be discovered by  which the pet creature can be rewarded for good conduct. I _never_ take  away food or water to induce obedience by privation--a practice which I  fear is often resorted to in training creatures for public  exhibition--but an additional dainty I much enjoy to bestow, as a means  of winning what is at first, it is true, merely cupboard love, but it  soon grows into something far deeper, a lifelong friendship, quite apart  from the food question.    Cleanliness is a _very_ important item in a bird's happiness. Whilst  kept in a cage with but little sand and an outside water-glass which  affords no means of washing its feathers, a bird is apt to become  infested with insects; it is tormented by them day and night, and having  no means of ridding itself of them, it grows thin and mopy, and at last  dies a miserable death.    There should be a bath supplied daily, suited to the size of the bird,  and so planned that the cage itself may not get wet, else it may give  the bird cramp to have to sit on a damp perch or floor. When its  feathers are dry, some insect powder may be carefully dusted under the  bird's wings, at the back of his head, where parasites are especially  apt to congregate, and all over the body, only taking care that the  powder may not get into the bird's eyes. The cage itself should be well  washed with carbolic soap and water, all the corners scrubbed with a  small brush; and, when dry, it might be sponged with carbolic lotion  over the wire-work to kill any insects which may yet remain.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    BIRDIE.      Amongst all the different birds which are kept in cages, either for  their beauty or song, there is one which to my mind far excels all  others, not only in its vocal powers, which are remarkable, but for its  very unusual intelligence. I refer to the Virginian nightingale. It is a  handsome, crimson plumaged bird, rather smaller than a starling, not  unfrequently seen in bird-sellers' collections, but seen there to the  worst possible advantage, for, being extremely shy and sensitive, and  taking keen notice of everything around, the slightest voice or movement  in the shop will make it flutter against the bars of its cage in an  agony of fright, and it therefore looks a most unlikely bird to become  an interesting pet; but I will try to show what may be done by gentle  kindness to overcome this natural timidity. This will be seen in the  history of Birdie, my first Virginian nightingale, my daily companion  for fourteen years.    He had belonged to a relative, and there was no way of tracing the age  of the bird when first obtained; I can therefore only speak of those  years in which he was in my possession. Birdie had been accustomed to  live in a cage on a high shelf in the kitchen, well cared for, no doubt,  but, untamed and unnoticed, he led a lonely life, and was one of the  wildest birds I ever met with. For many months his flutterings, when any  one came near his cage, could not be calmed, but by always speaking to  him when entering the room, and if possible giving him a few hemp-seeds  or any little dainty, he grew to endure one's presence; then, later on,  he would begin to greet one with a little clicking note, though still  retreating to the furthest corner of the cage, and a year or two passed  by before he would take anything out of my hand, but this was attained  by offering"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21137"],[0,"Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life (#7)"],[1,"they might lay about them a  little more freely, down went the first wicket amid the cheers of our  fellows, and we saw the figures 12 posted up on the telegraph, as  indicating the score so far standing to the credit of Westfield.    We had not long to wait for the next man in, and still less long to see  him out, poor fellow! for the very first ball sent his bails flying over  Steel's head, and he had to trudge back to the tent and take off his  pads almost before he had got used to the feel of them on his legs.    In the over following the arrival of his successor an easy catch by  point disposed of another wicket.    \"This is something like!\"  I exclaimed to myself.  \"Three men out for  fourteen runs.  If it goes on like this, we shall have it all our own  way\"; and in my satisfaction I ventured to communicate my ideas to the  man fielding at point.    \"Adams, will you attend to the game?\"  It was Steel who spoke, and at  the sound of his voice I started like one shot, and discovered that the  next man was in and ready to begin.  I stepped back to my place in an  instant, and would sooner have had one of Hurley's swiftest balls catch  me on the bare shin than be thus publicly called to order before the  whole field.  I can safely say that never in my life since that moment  have I caught myself talking during \"play\" in a cricket match.    I felt in disgrace, and got nervous; I dared not look at Steel, for fear  of meeting his eye.  I wished myself a mile away, and repented of my  satisfaction of being in the first eleven.  Most devoutly I hoped no  ball would chance near me, as I should assuredly miss it.  As the  thought passed my mind the man who was batting cut a ball hard and low  in my direction.  It was so hard and so low that under any circumstances  it would have been a most difficult ball to field, still more to catch.  It flew towards me a few inches from the ground, and I was in despair.  I knew every eye in the field was on me--Steel's in particular.  Here  would be some hundreds of witnesses to my utter imbecility!  Would that  the ground would swallow me!  I sprang forward and tripped as I sprang.  In my fall the ball dashed into my hand, and fell from it to the earth.  I had missed the catch, and my disgrace was complete.  Fancy then my  astonishment when I heard Steel's awful voice cry, \"Well tried, sir!\"  and when a distant sound of clapping reached me from the tents!  I could  not understand it at first; but I afterwards found out that by my lucky  trip I had more nearly succeeded in catching the ball than a more  experienced player would have done had he kept his balance, and so I got  credit for a good piece of play which I did not in the least deserve.  However, it served to recover me from my nervousness and bad spirits,  and incite me to a desire to accomplish something for which I could  honestly take credit.    Never was such a determination more called for than now.  Driver, the  captain of the Westfield eleven, was at the wickets, a most tremendous  hitter.  All bowling came alike to him.  The swifter the ball the  happier he was; sending one over the bowler's head, another nearly into  the scorers' tent, another among the spectators behind the ropes.  The  score, hitherto so slow, began to fly up.  Forty, fifty, sixty, seventy  we saw posted up in rapid succession, and wondered how it all would end.  He seemed to have as many lives as a cat.  Some easy catches were  missed, and some \"runs out\" were only just avoided.  Still he scored, no  matter who his partner was (and one or two came and went while he was  in); he hit away merrily, and the cheers of Westfield grew almost  monotonous from their frequency.    We on the \"off\" side, however, had not much to do, for nearly all  Driver's hits were to the \"on,\" and, curiously enough, nearly all found  their way between two of our men, the \"mid-wicket on\" and the \"long on,\"  just out of the reach of either.  I could not help wondering why neither  of these fellows altered his place, so as to guard the weak point.    It is curious how sometimes in cricket the same thing occurs to two  people at the same time.  While I was inwardly speculating on the result  of this change of position, Steel appeared to become aware of the same  necessity, for I saw him behind the batsman's back silently motioning  \"mid-wicket on\" to stand farther back, and \"mid on\" to come round to a  \"square\" position.  This manoeuvre, however, did not escape the wily  Driver, who sent his next ball to leg, and the next to the identical  spot \"mid-wicket on\" had just quitted.  Still, Steel motioned to them to  remain in their new posts.  He knew well enough that if a man has a  habit of hitting in any one direction, however studiously he tries to  avoid the place.  Nature will sooner or later assert herself, and the  ball will fly where it has been wont to fly.  So it was in this case.  He could _not_ resist an impulse to lift one specially tempting ball in  the direction of his old haunt, and sure enough in so doing he sent it  clean into \"long on's\" hands, and with his own innings ended, to our  great relief, the innings of his side, for a total score of 174, of  which he had contributed quite the odd 74.    It was a good round score to overtake, and things did not promise  cheerfully for us at the commencement of our innings.  The Westfield men  were happy in possessing two swift bowlers, who made havoc of the first  two or three on our side who presented themselves.  I was one of these.    When I started for the wickets, armed with pads and gloves and bat, I  did not feel happy; still, I was in hopes I might at least succeed in  \"breaking my duck's egg,\" which was more than could be said for either  of my predecessors.    I felt rather important as I requested the umpire to give me \"middle,\"  and hammered the mark a little with my bat.  Still, my feet fidgeted;  there was a sort of \"cobwebby\" feeling on my face, and a tickling  sensation in the small of my back, as I stood ready for my first ball,  which convinced me I was by no means at home in my new position.    \"Play!\" cries the umpire.    The bowler starts to run, with arm extended.  He makes a sort of curve  round the wicket, and balances himself on one foot as he discharges his  ball.  It comes like lightning, right on to my bat, twisting it in my  grasp, and then is snatched up in an instant by \"point,\" who tosses it  to the wicket-keeper, who returns it to the bowler.  All this is very  alarming.  Here are eleven men banded together with the one object of  putting me out, and they are all so quiet and determined about it that I  feel like a guilty thing as I stand there to defend my wicket.    The bowler starts again for his sinuous run, and again the ball whizzes  from his hand.  I lift my bat in an attempt to strike it; it slips under  it; there is a little \"click\" behind my back, and then the ball flies  aloft, and I discover that my services at the wicket are no longer  required.    So ended my first innings.  Happily for our side, some of the men who  went in afterwards made a better show than we three unfortunates who had  opened the ball had done.  Steel made forty, and two others about twenty  each, which, added to the odds and ends contributed by the rest of our  side, brought the Parkhurst score up to 102--72 runs behind our  competitors.    There was great jubilation among the Westfield partisans, as their  heroes entered on their second innings under such promising auspices,  especially when the redoubtable Driver went in first with the bat which  had wrought such wonders in the former innings.  There seemed every  probability, too, of his repeating his late performance with even  greater vigour, for the first ball which reached him he sent flying far  and high right over the tents for six, a magnificent hit, which fairly  deserved the praise it received, not from the Westfield fellows only,  but from ours, who for a moment could forget their rivalry to admire a  great exploit.  The next three balls were delivered to his partner at  the wickets, who blocked carefully, evidently bent on acting on the  defensive while his companion made the running.  From the fifth ball of  that over a bye was scored, which brought Driver once again to the end  facing the bowler.  The next ball came slightly to the \"off,\" and he  tried to cut it.  Either he miscalculated, or was careless about the  direction he gave it, for he lodged it clean into my hands, a safe and  easy catch, but a catch of enormous importance to our side, as it  disposed once and for all of our most dreaded opponent.    Bereft of their champion, the Westfield fellows only succeeded in  putting together the moderate score of fifty in their second innings, of  which twenty-four were contributed by one man.  So our spirits revived  somewhat, as we discovered we had only 123 to make to win.  That was  indeed plenty against such bowling, but it was a good deal less than we  had dreaded.    Well, the decisive innings began, as soon as we had fortified ourselves  with lunch, provided for us by our hospitable rivals.  The afternoon was  getting on, but still the crowd of spectators kept together patiently,  determined to see the end of the match.    \"Shall we do it?\"  I heard some one ask of Steel.    \"Do what?\" was the evasive reply.    \"Win,\" said the other.    \"How do I know?\" was our captain's curt answer.    If there was one thing that annoyed Steel above others, it was to be  asked foolish questions.    He sent in two steady men first, with orders not to be in a hurry to  score, but to \"break the back\" of the bowling.  And this advice they  faithfully acted upon.  For over after over there was nothing but  blocking.  In vain the bowlers strained every nerve to get round or  under those stubborn bats.  They could not do it!  Runs came few and far  between--the field had nothing to do--and altogether the game became  very monotonous."]]]
