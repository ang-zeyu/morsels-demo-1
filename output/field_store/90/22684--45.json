Will you join with my  cousin Arnvid and me against this young Shockhead?\"    \"Yes, I will do it,\" said the king.    [Decoration]      FOOTNOTES:    [8] See note about foster-father on page 197.          [Illustration]    The Sea Fight      Many men felt as Solfi did. So when King Audbiorn and King Arnvid sent  out their war arrows, a great host gathered. All men came by sea. Two  hundred ships lay at anchor in the fiord, looking like strange swimming  animals because of their high carved prows and bright paint. There were  red and gold dragons with long necks and curved tails. Sea-horses reared  out of the water. Green and gold snakes coiled up. Sea-hawks sat with  spread wings ready to fly. And among all these curved necks stood up the  tall, straight masts with the long yardarms swinging across them holding  the looped-up sails.    When the starting horn blew, and their sails were let down, it was like  the spreading of hundreds of curious flags. Some were striped black and  yellow or blue and gold. Some were white with a black raven or a brown  bear embroidered on them, or blue with a white sea-hawk, or black with  a gold sun. Some were edged with fur. As the wind filled the gaudy  sails, and the ships moved off, the men waved their hands to the women  on shore and sang:        \"To the sea! To the sea!      The wind in our sail,      The sea in our face,      And the smell of the fight.      After ship meets ship,      In the quarrel of swords      King Harald shall lie      In the caves under sea      And Norsemen shall laugh.\"    In the prow stood men leaning forward and sniffing the salt air with  joy. Some were talking of King Harald.    \"Yesterday he had a hard fight,\" they said. \"To-day he will be lying  still, dressing his wounds and mending his ships. We shall take him by  surprise.\"    They sailed near the coast. Solfi in his \"Sea-hawk\" was ahead leading  the way. Suddenly men saw his sail veer and his oars flash out. He had  quickly turned his boat and was rowing back. He came close to King  Arnvid and called:    \"He is there, ahead. His boats are ready in line of battle. The fox has  not been asleep.\"    King Arnvid blew his horn. Slowly his boats came into line with his  \"Sea-stag\" in the middle. Again he blew his horn. Cables were thrown  across from one prow to the next, and all the ships were tied together  so that their sides touched. Then the men set their sails again and they  went past a tongue of land into a broad fiord. There lay the long line  of King Harald's ships with their fierce heads grinning and mocking at  the newcomers. Back of those prows was what looked like a long wall with  spots of green and red and blue and yellow and shining gold. It was the  locked shields of the men in the bows, and over every shield looked  fierce blue eyes. Higher up and farther back was another wall of  shields; for on the half deck in the stern of every ship stood the  captain with his shield-guard of a dozen men.    Arnvid's people had furled their sails and were taking down the masts,  but the ships were still drifting on with the wind. The horn blew, and  quickly every man sprang to his place in bow and stern. All were leaning  forward with clenched teeth and widespread nostrils. They were clutching  their naked swords in their hands. Their flashing eyes looked over their  shields.    Soon King Arnvid's ships crashed into Harald's line, and immediately the  men in the bows began to swing their swords at one another. The soldiers  of the shield-guard on the high decks began to throw darts and stones  and to shoot arrows into the ships opposite them.    So in every ship showers of stones and arrows were falling, and many men  died under them or got broken arms or legs. Spears were hurled from deck  to deck and many of them bit deep into men's bodies. In every bow men  slashed with their swords at the foes in the opposite ship. Some jumped  upon the gunwale to get nearer or hung from the prow-head. Some even  leaped into the enemy's boat.    King Harald's ship lay prow to prow with King Arnvid's. The battle had  been going on for an hour. King Harald was still in the stern on the  deck. There was a dent in his helmet where a great stone had struck.  There was a gash in his shoulder where a spear had cut. But he was still  fighting and laughed as he worked.    \"Wolf meets wolf to-day,\" he said. \"But things are going badly in the  prow,\" he cried. \"Ivar fallen, Thorstein wounded, a dozen men lying in  the bottom of the boat!\"    He leaped down from the deck and ran along the gunwale, shouting as he  went:    \"Harald and victory!\"    So he came to the bow and stood swinging his sword as fast as he  breathed. Every time it hit a man of Arnvid's men. Harald's own warriors  cheered, seeing him.    \"Harald and victory!\" they shouted, and went to work again with good  heart.    Slowly King Arnvid's men fell back before Harald's biting sword. Then  Harald's men threw a great hook into that boat and pulled it alongside  and still pushed King Arnvid's people back.    \"Come on! Follow me!\" cried Harald.    Then he leaped into King Arnvid's boat, and his warriors followed him.    \"He comes like a mad wolf,\" King Arnvid's men said, and they turned and  ran back below the deck.    Then Arnvid himself leaped down and stood with his sword raised.    \"Can this young Shockhead make cowards of you all?\" he cried.    But Harald's sword struck him, and he fell dead. Then a big, bloody  viking of King Arnvid leaped upon the edge of the ship and stood there.  He held his drinking-horn and his sword high in his hands.    \"Ran[9] and not you, Shockhead, shall have them and me!\" he cried, and  leaped laughing into the water and was drowned.    Many other warriors chose the same death on that terrible day.    [Illustration: \"_Then he leaped into King Arnvid's boat_\"]    All along the line of boats men fought for hours. In some places the  cables had been cut, and the boats had drifted apart. Ships lay  scattered about two by two, fighting. May boats sank, many men died,  some fled away in their ships, and at the end King Harald had won the  battle. So he had King Arnvid's country and King Audbiorn's country.  Many men took the oath and became his friends. All people were talking  of his wonderful battles.    [Decoration]      FOOTNOTES:    [9] See note about Ran on page 198.          [Illustration]    King Harald's Wedding      It had taken King Harald ten years to fight so many battles. And all  that time he had not cut his hair or combed it. Now he was feasting one  day at an earl's house. Many people were there.    \"How is it, friends?\" Harald said. \"Have I kept my vow?\"    His friends answered:    \"You have kept your vow. There is no king but you in all Norway.\"    \"Then I think I will cut my hair,\" the king laughed.    So he went and bathed and put on fresh clothes. Then the earl cut his  hair and beard and combed them and put a gold band about his head. Then  he looked at him and said:    \"It is beautiful, smooth, and yellow.\"    And all people wondered at the beauty of the king's hair.    \"I will give you a new name,\" the earl said. \"You shall no longer be  called Shockhead. You shall be called Harald Hairfair.\"    \"It is a good name,\" everybody cried.    Then Harald said:    \"But I have another thing to do now. Guthorm, you shall take the same  message to Gyda that you gave ten years ago.\"    So Guthorm went and brought back this answer from Gyda:    \"I will marry the king of all Norway.\"    So when the wedding time came, Harald rode across the country to the  home of Gyda's father, Eric. Many men followed him. They were all richly  dressed in velvet and gold.    For three nights they feasted at Eric's house. On the next night Gyda  sat on the cross-bench with her women. A long veil of white linen  covered her face and head and hung down to the ground. After the  mead-horns had been brought in, Eric stood up from his high seat and  went down and stood before King Harald.    \"Will you marry Gyda now?\" he asked.    [Illustration: \"_I, Harald, King of Norway, take you Gyda, for my  wife_\"]    Harald jumped to his feet and laughed.    \"Yes,\" he said. \"I have waited long enough.\"    Then he stepped down from his high seat and stood by Eric. They walked  about the hall. Before them walked thralls carrying candles. Behind them  walked many of King Harald's great earls. Three times they walked around  the hall. The third time they stopped before the cross-bench. King  Harald and Eric stepped upon the platform, where the cross-bench was.    Eric gave a holy hammer to Harald, and it was like the hammer of Thor.  Harald put it upon Gyda's lap, saying:    \"With this holy hammer of Thor's, I, Harald, King of Norway, take you,  Gyda, for my wife.\"    Then he took a bunch of keys and tied it to Gyda's girdle, saying:    \"This is the sign that you are mistress of my house.\"    After that, Eric called out loudly:    \"Now, are Harald, King of Norway, and Gyda, daughter of Eric, man and  wife.\"    Then thralls brought meat and drink in golden dishes. They were about to  serve it to Gyda for the bride's feast, but Harald took the dish from  them and said:    \"No, I will serve my bride.\"    So he knelt and held the platter. When he did that his men shouted. Then  they talked among themselves, saying:    \"Surely Harald never knelt before. It is always other people who kneel  to him.\"    When the bride had tasted the food and touched the mead-horn to her lips  she stood up and walked from the hall. All her women followed her, but  the men stayed and feasted long.    On the next morning at breakfast Gyda sat by Harald's side. Soon the  king rose and said:    \"Father-in-law, our horses stand ready in the yard. Work is waiting for  me at home and on the sea. Lead out the bride.\"    So Eric took Gyda by the hand and led her out of the hall. Harald  followed close. When they passed through the door Eric"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24821"],[0,"Diamond Dyke (#7)"],[1,"Emson, dismounting and spreading out the net  upon the sand before they began carefully removing the spoil of the  nest--that is to say, the eggs, which evidently contained chicks.    This done, the net was folded over and tied here and there so as to form  a long bag, the ends fastened securely; and each taking an end, they  mounted, and swinging between them the huge bag, which now weighed  nearly a hundredweight, started for home.  They left the new-laid eggs  to be fetched that evening, or next morning, leaving them just as they  were spread, looking clean and fresh, about the outside of the nest,  much to Dyke's regret.    \"Why, we could manage them too,\" he said.    \"We might, but if we did we should have mixed them up with the others,  which would be a pity; for if we put them under a bird, they would only  be addled, whereas if we keep them separate, they will be good either to  set under another hen, or to eat.  They will not hurt there.\"    Dyke said no more, but held on tightly to the end of the net, helping  his brother to keep their horses a sufficient distance apart, so that  the egg purse might keep well off the ground, and not be shaken too much  by the horses' gentle pace.    \"Wonder what the young birds think of their ride,\" said Dyke merrily.  \"We shall have one of them chipping an egg presently, and poking out his  head to see what's the matter, and why things are getting so cold.\"    \"Cold, in this scorching sun!\" said Emson; \"why it would hatch them out.  Hold tight.\"    \"Right it is!\" cried Dyke in seafaring style.  \"I say, what a smash it  would be if I let go!\"    \"Ah, it would,\" said Emson; \"but you won't.  Cry stop when you're tired,  and we'll change hands.--Steady, boy!\" he continued to his horse, which  seemed disposed to increase its speed, and they jogged gently along  again.    \"I always used to read that the ostriches did lay their eggs in the sand  and leave them for the sun to hatch.\"    \"There is some truth in it,\" said Emson; \"but the old writers didn't get  to the bottom of it.  The sun would hatch them if it kept on shining,  but the cold nights would chill the eggs and undo all the day's work.  It's of a night that the birds sit closest.--Like to change now?\"    \"Yes: they are getting heavy for one's wrist,\" said Dyke; and the great  purse was lowered to the ground, the eggs clicking together as if made  of china.  Then the brothers changed places and hands; raised the net;  the horses hung apart again, and the slow journey was resumed.    \"Gently!\" cried Dyke before they had gone very far.  \"If you hang away  so hard, I shall be dragged out of the saddle.\"    The tension was relaxed, and they went on again riding by slow degrees  back to Kopfontein, which they finally reached with their heavy and  fragile load intact.    Dyke was hungry enough, but they neither ate nor rested till their eggs  were borne into one of the pens where three hens and their husband had a  nest which contained only ten eggs, and these were known to be addled,  for the time was long past for hatching; and upon the brothers  approaching the nest, there was a great deal of hissing and cackling,  the cock bird beginning to roar like a lion, and stalking menacingly  round the net, which he kept on inspecting curiously.    \"Be on the lookout for a kick,\" said Emson, as the net was lowered.    \"Oh, he won't kick me--will you, old chap?\" cried Dyke, giving the large  bird a playful poke, which had the effect of sending him off  remonstrating angrily, as if he resented such liberties being taken with  his ribs.  For he turned when he reached the fence, and stood fluttering  his short wings, clucking, and making threatening gestures with his  head.    The hen bird sitting was much more amenable to their approach, for,  after a little persuasion, she rose in a very stately way, blinked her  rather human-looking, eye-lashed optics, and stalked to the other wives  to stand with them, hissing and cackling a little, while the bad eggs  were removed and the fresh thirty-nine were put in their place, Emson  arranging them as regularly as he could in accordance with the bird's  habits.    But as Dyke handed them to him one by one, they had hard work to get  them in on account of the impatience displayed by the wives, two of  which displayed a great eagerness to have first sit upon the nestful,  and needing to be kept off until all were ready.    Then began a severe quarrel, and a good deal of pecking before the  youngest and strongest succeeded in mounting upon the nest, shuffling  the eggs about so as to get them more in accordance with her own idea of  the fitness of things, and then, when all were in order, she settled  down with her plumage regularly covering up the eggs, while the other  birds now looked on.    \"Do you double up your perambulators?\" said Dyke mockingly.  \"Yes,  madam, I see you do; but pray don't put a toe through either of the  shells.\"    The hen uttered a strangely soft clucking kind of noise, as if in reply,  and there was a peculiar look of satisfaction about the huge tame  creature as she covered the gigantic clutch.    \"So they are,\" said Dyke--\"something like eggs, aren't they?--I say,  look at the others,\" he continued, as they stalked off to go apparently  to discuss the new arrivals with the cock bird over at the other side of  the enclosure.    \"There,\" said Emson, \"you can have these addled eggs cleaned out, Dyke,  and we'll make chunking cups of them.  When shall we fetch the other  lot?  This evening?\"    \"If you like.\"    \"No; we'll leave it till to-morrow, and give the nags a rest.\"        CHAPTER SIX.    LIONS AT HOME.    Fortune smiled her brightest upon Joseph Emson when they first came up  the country, travelling for months in their wagon, till Kopfontein, with  its never-failing spring in the granite chasm, was settled upon as being  a capital place to carry out the idea of the ostrich-farm.  Then the  rough house was run up, and in course of time pens and other enclosures  made, and by very slow degrees stocked with the gigantic birds,  principally by help of Kaffir servants; Jack showing himself to be very  clever in finding nests of eggs, but afterwards proving lazy and  indifferent, excusing himself on the plea that \"Baas got all eggs.  No  more.  All gone.\"    It seemed to be a capital idea, and promised plenty of success, for at  first the feathers they obtained from the Kaffirs sold well, making  capital prices when sent down to Cape Town.  Then the supply from the  native hunters began to fail; and when at last the young farmers had  plumes to sell of their own raising, prices had gone down terribly, and  Emson saw plainly enough that he was losing by his venture.    Then he began to lose his birds by accident, by the destructive  propensities of the goblin and a vicious old hen or two; and lastly,  some kind of epidemic, which they dubbed ostrich chicken-pox, carried  the young birds off wholesale.    Then Dyke began to be damped, and grew dull, and soon his brother became  low-spirited too, and for a whole year matters had gone on from bad to  worse; Emson often asking himself whether it was not time to make a  fresh start, but always coming to the same frame of mind that it was too  soon to be beaten yet, and keeping a firm upper lip in the presence of  his brother.    The morning after the finding of the ostrich's nest, they started again,  taking the net, and keeping a keen lookout in the hope of discovering  another.    \"There's no reason why we should not,\" said Emson.  \"I've been too easy  with Jack; he has not disturbed the birds around for months.\"    \"I think we can find the nest again,\" said Dyke.    \"Why not?  We'll find it by the footmarks, if we cannot any other way.  But I think I can ride straight to it.\"    They kept a sharp lookout, but no ostrich sprang up in the distance and  sped away like the wind.  About six miles from home, though, something  else was seen lying right out on the plain, to which Dyke pointed.    \"A bird?\" cried Emson.  \"Yes, I see it.  No; a beast.  Why, Dyke, old  chap, there are two of them.  What shall we do?  Creep in and try a  shot, or let them go off?\"    \"I should try a shot,\" said the boy excitedly.  \"Why, one is a big-maned  fellow.\"    \"Then perhaps we had better let them alone.\"    \"What! to come and pull down one of the oxen.  No: let's have a shot at  them.\"    \"Very well,\" said Emson quietly; \"but see that you have a couple of  bullets in your rifle.  Make sure.\"    He set the example by opening the breech of his piece, and carefully  examining the cartridges before replacing them.    \"All right,\" he cried.  \"Now, look here, Dyke.  Be ready and smart, if  the brutes turn upon us to charge.  Sit fast, and give Breezy his head  then.  No lion would overtake him.  Only you must be prepared for a  sharp wheel round, for if the brutes come on with a roar, your cob will  spin about like a teetotum.\"    But no satisfactory shot was obtained, for when they were about a  quarter of a mile away, a big, dark-maned lion rose to his feet, stood  staring at them for nearly a minute, and then started off at a canter,  closely followed by its companion.    Dyke looked sharply round at his brother, as if to say, \"Come on!\" but  Emson shook his head.    \"Not to-day, old chap,\" he cried.  \"We're too busy.  It would mean, too,  a long gallop, tiring our horses before we could get a shot, and then we  should not be in good condition for aiming.\"    \"Oh, but, Joe, I daresay that is the wretch that killed the white ox,  and he is hanging about after another.\"    \"To be sure: I forgot that,\" cried Emson excitedly.  \"Come on.  But  steady: we can't lose sight of them, so let's canter, and follow till  they stand at bay or sneak into the bushes.\"    That was more to Dyke's taste, and side by side they followed the two  lions, as the great tawny-looking beasts cantered over the plain, their  heads down, tails drooping, and"]]]
