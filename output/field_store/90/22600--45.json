[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22693"],[0,"A Book of Myths (#7)"],[1,"  music coming from far away, or listen to the plaintive song of the  bird, are things that very specially belong to the story of Orpheus.    In the country of Thrace, surrounded by all the best gifts of the  gods, Orpheus was born. His father was Apollo, the god of music and of  song, his mother the muse Calliope. Apollo gave his little son a lyre,  and himself taught him how to play it. It was not long before all the  wild things in the woods of Thrace crept out from the green trees and  thick undergrowth, and from the holes and caves in the rocks, to  listen to the music that the child's fingers made. The coo of the dove  to his mate, the flute-clear trill of the blackbird, the song of the  lark, the liquid carol of the nightingale--all ceased when the boy  made music. The winds that whispered their secrets to the trees owned  him for their lord, and the proudest trees of the forest bowed their  heads that they might not miss one exquisite sigh that his fingers  drew from the magical strings. Nor man nor beast lived in his day that  he could not sway by the power of his melody. He played a lullaby, and  all things slept. He played a love-lilt, and the flowers sprang up in  full bloom from the cold earth, and the dreaming red rosebud opened  wide her velvet petals, and all the land seemed full of the loving  echoes of the lilt he played. He played a war-march, and, afar off,  the sleeping tyrants of the forest sprang up, wide awake, and bared  their angry teeth, and the untried youths of Thrace ran to beg their  fathers to let them taste battle, while the scarred warriors felt on  their thumbs the sharpness of their sword blades, and smiled, well  content. While he played it would seem as though the very stones and  rocks gained hearts. Nay, the whole heart of the universe became one  great, palpitating, beautiful thing, an instrument from whose  trembling strings was drawn out the music of Orpheus.    He rose to great power, and became a mighty prince of Thrace. Not his  lute alone, but he himself played on the heart of the fair Eurydice  and held it captive. It seemed as though, when they became man and  wife, all happiness must be theirs. But although Hymen, the god of  marriage, himself came to bless them on the day they wed, the omens on  that day were against them. The torch that Hymen carried had no golden  flame, but sent out pungent black smoke that made their eyes water.  They feared they knew not what; but when, soon afterwards, as Eurydice  wandered with the nymphs, her companions, through the blue-shadowed  woods of Thrace, the reason was discovered. A bold shepherd, who did  not know her for a princess, saw Eurydice, and no sooner saw her than  he loved her. He ran after her to proclaim to her his love, and she,  afraid of his wild uncouthness, fled before him. She ran, in her  terror, too swiftly to watch whither she went, and a poisonous snake  that lurked amongst the fern bit the fair white foot that flitted,  like a butterfly, across it. In agonised suffering Eurydice died. Her  spirit went to the land of the Shades, and Orpheus was left  broken-hearted.    The sad winds that blow at night across the sea, the sobbing gales  that tell of wreck and death, the birds that wail in the darkness for  their mates, the sad, soft whisper of the aspen leaves and the leaves  of the heavy clad blue-black cypresses, all now were hushed, for  greater than all, more full of bitter sorrow than any, arose the music  of Orpheus, a long-drawn sob from a broken heart in the Valley of the  Shadow of Death.    Grief came alike to gods and to men as they listened, but no comfort  came to him from the expression of his sorrow. At length, when to bear  his grief longer was impossible for him, Orpheus wandered to Olympus,  and there besought Zeus to give him permission to seek his wife in the  gloomy land of the Shades. Zeus, moved by his anguish, granted the  permission he sought, but solemnly warned him of the terrible perils  of his undertaking.    But the love of Orpheus was too perfect to know any fear; thankfully  he hastened to the dark cave on the side of the promontory of  Taenarus, and soon arrived at the entrance of Hades. Stark and grim  was the three-headed watchdog, Cerberus, which guarded the door, and  with the growls and the furious roaring of a wild beast athirst for  its prey it greeted Orpheus. But Orpheus touched his lute, and the  brute, amazed, sank into silence. And still he played, and the dog  would gently have licked the player's feet, and looked up in his face  with its savage eyes full of the light that we see in the eyes of the  dogs of this earth as they gaze with love at their masters. On, then,  strode Orpheus, playing still, and the melody he drew from his lute  passed before him into the realms of Pluto.    Surely never were heard such strains. They told of perfect, tender  love, of unending longing, of pain too great to end with death. Of all  the beauties of the earth they sang--of the sorrow of the world--of  all the world's desire--of things past--of things to come. And ever,  through the song that the lute sang, there came, like a thread of  silver that is woven in a black velvet pall, a limpid melody. It was  as though a bird sang in the mirk night, and it spoke of peace and of  hope, and of joy that knows no ending.    Into the blackest depths of Hades the sounds sped on their way, and  the hands of Time stood still. From his bitter task of trying to quaff  the stream that ever receded from the parched and burning lips,  Tantalus ceased for a moment. The ceaseless course of Ixion's wheel  was stayed, the vulture's relentless beak no longer tore at the  Titan's liver; Sisyphus gave up his weary task of rolling the stone  and sat on the rock to listen, the Danaides rested from their labour  of drawing water in a sieve. For the first time, the cheeks of the  Furies were wet with tears, and the restless shades that came and went  in the darkness, like dead autumn leaves driven by a winter gale,  stood still to gaze and listen. Before the throne where Pluto and his  queen Proserpine were seated, sable-clad and stern, the relentless  Fates at their feet, Orpheus still played on. And to Proserpine then  came the living remembrance of all the joys of her girlhood by the  blue AEgean Sea in the fair island of Sicily. Again she knew the  fragrance and the beauty of the flowers of spring. Even into Hades the  scent of the violets seemed to come, and fresh in her heart was the  sorrow that had been hers on the day on which the ruthless King of  Darkness tore her from her mother and from all that she held most  dear. Silent she sat beside her frowning, stern-faced lord, but her  eyes grew dim.    When, with a quivering sigh, the music stopped, Orpheus fearlessly  pled his cause. To let him have Eurydice, to give him back his more  than life, to grant that he might lead her with him up to \"the light  of Heaven\"--that was his prayer.    The eyes of Pluto and Proserpine did not dare to meet, yet with one  accord was their answer given. Eurydice should be given back to him,  but only on one condition. Not until he had reached the light of earth  again was he to turn round and look upon the face for a sight of which  his eyes were tired with longing. Eagerly Orpheus complied, and with a  heart almost breaking with gladness he heard the call for Eurydice and  turned to retrace his way, with the light footfall of the little feet  that he adored making music behind him. Too good a thing it  seemed--too unbelievable a joy. She was there--quite close to him.  Their days of happiness were not ended. His love had won her back,  even from the land of darkness. All that he had not told her of that  love while yet she was on earth he would tell her now. All that he had  failed in before, he would make perfect now. The little limping  foot--how it made his soul overflow with adoring tenderness. So near  she was, he might even touch her were he to stretch back his hand....    And then there came to him a hideous doubt. What if Pluto had played  him false? What if there followed him not Eurydice, but a mocking  shade? As he climbed the steep ascent that led upwards to the light,  his fear grew more cruelly real. Almost he could imagine that her  footsteps had stopped, that when he reached the light he would find  himself left once more to his cruel loneliness. Too overwhelming for  him was the doubt. So nearly there they were that the darkness was no  longer that of night, but as that of evening when the long shadows  fall upon the land, and there seemed no reason for Orpheus to wait.    Swiftly he turned, and found his wife behind him, but only for a  moment she stayed. Her arms were thrown open and Orpheus would fain  have grasped her in his own, but before they could touch each other  Eurydice was borne from him, back into the darkness.    \"Farewell!\" she said--\"Farewell!\" and her voice was a sigh of hopeless  grief. In mad desperation Orpheus sought to follow her, but his  attempt was vain. At the brink of the dark, fierce-flooded Acheron the  boat with its boatman, old Charon, lay ready to ferry across to the  further shore those whose future lay in the land of Shades. To him ran  Orpheus, in clamorous anxiety to undo the evil he had wrought. But  Charon angrily repulsed him. There was no place for such as Orpheus in  his ferry-boat. Those only who went, never to return, could find a  passage there. For seven long days and seven longer nights Orpheus  waited beside the river, hoping that Charon would relent, but at last  hope died, and he sought the depths of the forests of Thrace, where  trees and rocks and beasts and birds were all his friends.    He took his lyre again then and played:        \"Such strains as would have won the ear      Of Pluto, to have quite set free      His half-regained Eurydice.\"            Milton.

The varied characters are admirably drawn, and are individual,  distinct, and effectively contrasted. The incidents are all shaped and  combined with remarkable skill; and, as the _Athenaeum_ observes, \"Here,  there, everywhere, the author gives evidence of passionate and romantic  power.\" In some of the episodes, as in that of Wolfgang Hegewisch, for  example, in which are illustrated the tendency of a desperate philosophy  and hopeless skepticism, we have that sort of mastery of the feelings,  that chaining of the intensest interest, which distinguishes the most  wonderful compositions of Poe, or the German Hoffman, or Zschokke in his  \"Walpurgis Night;\" and every incident in the book tends with directest  certainty to the fulfilment of its main design.    The only other work of which Mr. Kimball is the acknowledged author, is  \"Cuba and the Cubans;\" a volume illustrative of the history, and social,  political, and economical condition of the island of Cuba, written  during the excitement occasioned by its invasion from the United States,  in 1849, and exhibiting a degree of research, and a judicial fairness of  statement and argument, which characterizes no other production upon  this subject. As it was generally admitted to be the most reliable,  complete, and altogether important work, upon points commanding the  attention of several nations, its circulation was very large; but it was  produced for a temporary purpose, and it will be recalled to popularity  only by a renewal of the inevitable controversies which await the  political relations of the Antilles.    \"A Story of Calais,\" in the following pages, is an example of Mr.  Kimball's success as a tale writer. Though less remarkable than passages  in \"St. Leger,\" it will vindicate his right to a place among the chief  creators of such literature among us.    FOOTNOTES:    [9] The Inner-Life, a Review of St. Leger, by Professor Tayler Lewis,  LL. D., &c.          THE BISHOP OF JAMAICA.      Among the distinguished strangers who visited the United States during  the last season, no one has left a more favorable impression upon  American society than the thoroughly accomplished scholar and highbred  gentleman, the Bishop of Jamaica. We propose a brief sketch of his  history:    AUBREY GEORGE SPENCER, D.D. and D.C.L., was born in London on the 12th  of February, 1795, and is the eldest son of the late Hon. William  Spencer, the poet, whose father, Lord Charles Spencer, was a son of  Charles the second Duke of Marlborough, and grandson of John Churchill,  the illustrious hero of Ramillies and Blenheim. His Christian names were  given by the Dukes of St. Albans and Marlborough, who were his great  uncles and godfathers. His mother was Susan Jennison, a countess of the  Holy Roman Empire, and a lady of singular beauty and accomplishments, to  whom Mr. William Spencer was married at the court of Hesse Darmstadt, in  1791. Aubrey Spencer and his younger brother George (subsequently Bishop  of Madras,) received the rudiments of learning at the Abbey School of  St. Albans, whence the former was soon removed to the seminary of the  celebrated Grecian, D. Burme, of Greenwich, and the latter to the  Charter house. For some time previous to his matriculation at Magdalen  Hall, Oxford, Mr. Aubrey Spencer was the private pupil of Mr. Mitchell,  the very learned translator of Aristophanes. At the house of his father  in Curzon street, at Melbourne House in Chiswick, Blenheim, and  Woolbeednig, Hallowell Hill, (the seat of the Countess Dowager Spencer,)  he was in frequent and familiar intercourse with many of the most  distinguished contemporary statesmen, philosophers, and other men of  letters; and in this society his own literary and conversational talents  obtained an early celebrity, and commended him to the regard and  friendship of Mr. Rogers, Mr. Campbell, Lord Byron, Mr. Hallam, Lord  Dudley, Mr. Coutts, Mr. Wordsworth, Mr. Francis, Mr. Homer, Thomas  Moore, Mr. Southey, Lady Caroline Lamb, Mr. Crabb, and many other  authors, with some of whom he still maintains a correspondence, while  some have fallen asleep.    With the society of the county of Oxford, and with that of the  University, he was equally popular. In the early part of the year 1818,  he took leave of his College, on being ordained deacon, and entered on a  charge of the parish of Great Oakering, in the diocese of London. From  this, which is a very unhealthy part of Essex, he removed at the end of  the year to Bannam, Norfolk, where he became the neighbor and frequent  guest of the Earl of Albemarle and the Bishop of Norwich. In March,  1819, he was admitted a priest, and soon after gave up the brilliant  society in which he had hitherto lived, and devoted himself to the  Church in the Colonies, where, for a quarter of a century, he has filled  a distinguished part as archdeacon and bishop.    His first visit to the Bermudas was undertaken for the recovery of his  health, to which a colder climate has always been hostile; and when, in  the year 1825, these islands were attached to the diocese of Nova  Scotia, he was, at the instance of the late Primate, appointed to them  as Archdeacon and Ecclesiastical Commissary to the Bishop of the see.  Here he may be said to have created the Ecclesiastical Establishment  which, under his conciliatory influence, has so rapidly and largely  increased; and with it he soon associated the revival of Bishop  Berkeley's Classical Academy, and a system of general instruction, of  which a chain of schoolhouses, from either extremity of the island, are  the abiding monuments.    From his connection with the Bishop of Nova Scotia, the visits of  Archdeacon Spencer to that colony were frequent, and many of the  inhabitants both of that province and of New Brunswick retain a lively  impression of his abilities, as they were illustrated in his preaching  and in the practice of the other duties of his profession and position.    In July, 1839, Dr. Spencer was consecrated by the venerable Archbishop  of Canterbury, on the nomination of the crown, to the new see of  Newfoundland, retaining still episcopal jurisdiction over the isles of  Bermuda, under the extension of the Colonial Episcopate, which relieved  the indefatigable Bishop of Nova Scotia of a large portion of his cares.  The new Bishop was enabled, by the aid of the Society for the Promotion  of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, to quadruple the number of his clergy  within four years, and to consecrate more than twenty additional  churches within the same period. A very grateful sense of the Bishop's  exertions, and of the prosperous results of his unceasing labor, was  manifested in the several addresses presented to his lordship on his  subsequent translation to the diocese of Jamaica, by the clergy and  laity of Newfoundland and Bermuda.    In a paper which only purports to be a biographical notice of one who is  still living, it is not desirable to do more than briefly advert to the  principal topics and dates of a history which may hereafter be  advantageously amplified and filled up. The real progress of the  established church in Newfoundland at this period, would be best  gathered from the Bishop's letters to the government and the religious  societies, and to the clergy under his jurisdiction, but to these  documents it is not likely that any biographer will have unreserved  access during the life of his lordship.    On the decease of Bishop Lipscombe, in April, 1843, Bishop Spencer was  translated, under circumstances peculiarly indicative of the high  opinion which was had of his ability by the Queen's ministers and the  heads of the English church, to the see of Jamaica, one of the most  important connected with the crown. He quitted his old diocese, as the  papers of the day amply testify, with the respect of all denominations  of Christians. A national ship, the Hermes, was appointed to convey him  and his family and suite to Jamaica, where he arrived in the first week  of November, having made the land on the auspicious festival of All  Saints.    The sermon delivered by him at his installation, in the cathedral at  Spanish Town, was published at the request of the Speaker of the House  of Assembly, while the Earl of Elgin, the Governor-General, in his  speech to the Legislature, \"congratulated the inhabitants of Jamaica on  the appointment of a prelate of such approved talents and piety to that  see.\" At every point of the Bishop's visitation, which he commenced by a  convention of eighty clergymen, at Spanish Town, he was met by  congratulatory addresses from the vestries, and other corporate bodies,  declaratory of their confidence in his projected measures, and of their  desire to aid him in the extension of the church. In consonance with his  views the local Legislature passed an act increasing the number of  island curates, and providing higher salaries for their support, while  at the same time, they granted three thousand pounds as a first  instalment to the Church Society, which had been organized by him, and  to which the Governor-General contributed the annual sum of one hundred  pounds.    On his visit to England in 1845 and in the beginning of 1846, he was  continually employed in preaching in aid of various charities, and in  assisting at"]]]
