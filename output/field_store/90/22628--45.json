The deer was killed, the wind rose, the sails filled, and the Greek  fleet soon came within sight of the high walls and towers of Troy.  There, contrary to their expectations, the Greeks found the people ready  to fight them; but, after many days' struggle, they saw that they had  made no great advance.    On the wide plain which stretched out between the city and the sea, the  Greek and Tro'jan armies fought many a battle; and sometimes one party,  and sometimes the other, had the victory. The men on both sides had been  trained to handle their weapons with great skill, and there were many  fights in which the Greek heroes met the bravest Trojans.    [Illustration]    Nine years passed thus in continual warfare, but even then the Greeks  were as far from taking the town as on the first day; and the Trojans,  in spite of all their courage, had not been able to drive their enemies  away.          XVI. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.      In all their battles, the booty won by the Greeks from the enemy had  been divided among the chiefs and soldiers, and on one occasion female  slaves were given to Agamemnon and Achilles. These girls were not born  slaves, but were captives of war reduced to slavery, as was then the  custom; for, while the men and boys were always killed, the women and  girls were forced to be the servants of the victors.    Now, it happened that the slave given to Agamemnon was the daughter of a  priest of A-pol'lo. He was very sorry when he heard she had fallen into  the hands of the Greeks, and sent a message to Agamemnon, offering to  give him a large sum of money if he would only set her free.    Agamemnon would not accept the money, and sent a rude message to the  priest, who, in anger, asked Apollo to avenge this insult by sending a  plague upon the Greeks. The god heard and granted this prayer, and soon  all the soldiers in the Greek camp were suffering from a terrible  disease, of which many of them died.    As no remedy could relieve the sufferers, the Greek leaders consulted an  oracle, to find out how the plague might be stopped. Then they learned  that Apollo was angry with Agamemnon because he had refused to give up  his slave, and that the Greeks would continue to suffer until he made up  his mind to give her back to her father.    Thus forced to give her up to save his men from further suffering and  even from death, Agamemnon angrily said he would take Achilles' slave  instead, and he had her brought to wait upon him in his tent.    Achilles, who wanted to save the Greeks from the plague, allowed the  maiden to depart, warning Agamemnon, however, that he would no longer  fight for a chief who could be so selfish and unjust. As soon as the  girl had gone, therefore, he laid aside his fine armor; and although he  heard the call for battle, and the din of fighting, he staid quietly  within his tent.    While Achilles sat thus sulking day after day, his companions were  bravely fighting. In spite of their bravery, however, the Trojans were  gaining the advantage; for, now that Achilles was no longer there to  fill their hearts with terror, they fought with new courage.    The Greeks, missing the bright young leader who always led them into the  midst of the fray, were gradually driven back by the Trojans, who  pressed eagerly forward, and even began to set fire to some of the Greek  ships.    Achilles' friend, Patroclus, who was fighting at the head of the Greeks,  now saw that the Trojans, unless they were checked, would soon destroy  the whole army, and he rushed into Achilles' tent to beg him to come and  help them once more.    His entreaties were vain. Achilles refused to move a step; but he  consented at last to let Patroclus wear his armor, and, thus disguised,  make a last attempt to rally the Greeks and drive back the Trojans.    Patroclus started out, and, when the Trojans saw the well-known armor,  they shrank back in terror, for they greatly feared Achilles. They soon  saw their mistake, however; and Hector, rushing forward, killed  Patroclus, tore the armor off his body, and retired to put it on in  honor of his victory.    Then a terrible struggle took place between the Trojans and the Greeks  for the possession of Patroclus' body. The news of his friend's death  had quickly been carried to Achilles, and had roused him from his  indifferent state. Springing upon the wall that stretched before the  camp, he gave a mighty shout, at the sound of which the Trojans fled,  while Ajax and Ulysses brought back the body of Patroclus.          XVII. DEATH OF HECTOR AND ACHILLES.      The next day, having secured armor and weapons, Achilles again went out  to fight. His purpose was to meet Hector, and, by killing him, to avenge  his dead friend, Patroclus. He therefore rushed up and down the  battlefield; and when at last he came face to face with his foe, they  closed in deadly fight. The two young men, each the champion warrior of  his army, were now fighting with the courage of despair; for, while  Achilles was thirsting to avenge his friend, Hector knew that the fate  of Troy depended mostly upon his arm. The struggle was terrible. It was  watched with breathless interest by the armies on both sides, and by  aged Priam and the Trojan women from the walls of Troy. In spite of  Hector's courage, in spite of all his skill, he was doomed to die, and  soon he fell under the blows of Achilles.    Then, in sight of both armies and of Hector's weeping family, Achilles  took off his enemy's armor, bound the dead body by the feet to his  chariot, and dragged it three times around the city walls before he went  back to camp to mourn over the remains of Patroclus.    That night, guided by one of the gods, old King Priam came secretly into  the Greek camp, and, stealing into Achilles' tent, fell at his feet. He  had come to beg Achilles to give back the body of Hector, that he might  weep over it, and bury it with all the usual ceremonies and honors.    Touched by the old man's tears, and ready now to listen to his better  feelings, Achilles kindly raised the old king, comforted him with gentle  words, and not only gave back the body, but also promised that there  should be a truce of a few days, so that both armies could bury their  dead in peace.    The funerals were held, the bodies burned, the usual games celebrated;  and when the truce was over, the long war was begun again. After several  other great fights, Achilles died from a wound in his heel caused by a  poisoned arrow that was treacherously shot by Paris.    The sorrowing Greeks then buried the young hero on the wide plain  between Troy and the sea. This spot has been visited by many people who  admired the brave young hero of the Il'i-ad (see p. 60).    [Illustration]          XVIII. THE BURNING OF TROY.      As the valor of the Greeks had proved of no avail during the ten-years'  war, and as they were still as far as ever from taking Troy, Ulysses the  crafty now proposed to take the city by a stratagem, or trick.    The Greeks, obeying his directions, built a wooden horse of very large  size. It was hollow, and the space inside it was large enough to hold a  number of armed men. When this horse was finished, and the men were  hidden in it, the Greeks all embarked as if to sail home.    The Trojans, who had watched them embark and sail out of sight, rushed  down to the shore shouting for joy, and began to wander around the  deserted camp. They soon found the huge wooden horse, and were staring  wonderingly at it, when they were joined by a Greek who had purposely  been left behind, and who now crept out of his hiding place.    In answer to their questions, this man said that his companions had  deserted him, and that the wooden horse had been built and left there as  an offering to Po-sei'don (or Nep'tune), god of the sea. The Trojans,  believing all this, now decided to keep the wooden horse in memory of  their long siege, and the useless attempt of the Greeks to take Troy.    They therefore joyfully dragged the huge animal into the city; and, as  the gates were not large enough for it to pass through, they tore down  part of their strong walls.    That very night, while all the Trojans were sleeping peacefully for the  first time in many years, without any fear of a midnight attack, the  Greek vessels noiselessly sailed back to their old moorings. The  soldiers landed in silence, and, marching up softly, joined their  companions, who had crept out of the wooden horse, and had opened all  the gates to receive them.    Pouring into Troy on all sides at once, the Greeks now began their work  of destruction, killing, burning, and stealing everywhere. The Trojan  warriors, awakening from sleep, vainly tried to defend themselves; but  all were killed except Prince AE-ne'as, who escaped with his family and a  few faithful friends, to form a new kingdom in Italy.    All the women, including even the queen and her daughters, were made  prisoners and carried away by the Greek heroes. The men were now very  anxious to return home with the booty they had won; for they had done  what they had long wished to do, and Troy, the beautiful city, was  burned to the ground.    All this, as you know, happened many years ago,--so many that no one  knows just how long. The city thus destroyed was never rebuilt. Some  years ago a German traveler began to dig on the spot where it once  stood. Deep down under the ground he found the remains of beautiful  buildings, some pottery, household utensils, weapons, and a great deal  of gold, silver, brass, and bronze. All these things were blackened or  partly melted by fire, showing that the Greeks had set fire to the city,  as their famous old poems relate.    The Greeks said, however, that their gods were very angry with many of  their warriors on account of the cruelty they showed on that dreadful  night,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],[0,"The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#7)"],[1,"the water in an upright position, holding my gun with both hands.  This  I intended to have, used as a club in case I should be attacked by the  alligators; but I had chosen the hot hour of noon, when these creatures  lie in a half-torpid state, and to my joy I was not molested.    \"Half an hour's drifting with the current carried me to the end of the  lake, and I found myself at the _debouchure_ of the bayou.  Here, to my  great delight, I saw my boat in the swamp, where it had been caught and  held fast by the sedge.  A few minutes more, and I had swung myself over  the gunwale, and was sculling with eager strokes down the smooth waters  of the bayou.    \"Of course my adventure was ended, and I reached the settlement in  safety, but without the object of my excursion.  I was enabled, however,  to procure it some days after, and had the gratification of being able  to keep my promise to my friend.\"    Besancon's adventure had interested all of us; the old hunter-naturalist  seemed delighted with it.  No doubt it revived within him the memories  of many a perilous incident in his own life.    It was evident that in the circle of the camp-fire there was more than  one pair of lips ready to narrate some similar adventure, but the hour  was late, and all agreed it would be better to go to rest.  On to-morrow  night, some other would take their turn; and, in fact, a regular  agreement was entered into that each one of the party who had at any  period of his life been the hero or participator in any hunting  adventure should narrate the same for the entertainment of the others.  This would bring out a regular \"round of stories by the camp-fire,\" and  would enable us to kill the many long evenings we had to pass before  coming up with the buffalo.  The conditions were, that the stories  should exclusively relate to birds or animals--in fact, any hunted game  belonging to the _fauna_ of the American Continent: furthermore, that  each should contribute his _quota_ of information about whatever animal  should chance to be the subject of the narration--about its habits, its  geographical range; in short, its general natural history, as well as  the various modes of hunting it, practised in different places by  different people.  This, it was alleged, would render our camp  conversation instructive as well as entertaining.    The idea originated with the old hunter-naturalist, who very wisely  reasoned that among so many gentlemen of large hunting experience he  might collect new facts for his favourite science--for to just such men,  and not to the closet-dreamer, is natural history indebted for its most  interesting chapters.  Of course every one of us, guides and all, warmly  applauded the proposal, for there was no one among us averse to  receiving a little knowledge of so entertaining a character.  No doubt  to the naturalist himself we should be indebted for most part of it; and  his mode of communicating was so pleasant, that even the rude trappers  listened to him with wonder and attention.  They saw that he was no  \"greenhorn\" either in woodcraft or prairie knowledge, and that was a  sufficient claim to their consideration.    There is no character less esteemed by the regular \"mountain-man\" than a  \"greenhorn,\"--that is, one who is new to the ways of their wilderness  life.    With the design of an early start, we once more crept into our several  quarters, and went to sleep.        CHAPTER FOUR.    THE PASSENGER-PIGEONS.    After an early breakfast we lit our pipes and cigars, and took to the  road.  The sun was very bright, and in less than two hours after  starting we were sweltering under a heat almost tropical.  It was one of  those autumn days peculiar to America, where even a high latitude seems  to be no protection against the sun, and his beams fall upon one with as  much fervour as they would under the line itself.  The first part of our  journey was through open woods of black-jack, whose stunted forms  afforded no shade, but only shut off the breeze which might otherwise  have fanned us.    While fording a shallow stream, the doctor's scraggy, ill-tempered horse  took a fit of kicking quite frantical.  For some time it seemed likely  that either the doctor himself, or his saddle-bags, would be deposited  in the bottom of the creek, but after a severe spell of whipping and  kicking on the part of the rider, the animal moved on again.  What had  set it dancing?  That was the question.  It had the disposition to be  \"frisky,\" but usually appeared to be lacking in strength.  The buzz of a  horse-fly sounding in our ears explained all.  It was one of those large  insects--the \"horse-bug,\"--peculiar to the Mississippi country, and  usually found near watercourses.  They are more terrible to horses than  a fierce dog would be.  I have known horses gallop away from them as if  pursued by a beast of prey.    There is a belief among western people that these insects are propagated  by the horses themselves; that is, that the eggs of the female are  deposited upon the grass, so that the horses may swallow them; that  incubation goes on within the stomach of the animal, and that the  chrysalis is afterwards voided.  I have met with others who believed in  a still stranger theory; that the insect itself actually sought, and  found, a passage into the stomach of the horse, some said by passing  down his throat, others by boring a hole through his abdomen; and that  in such cases the horse usually sickened, and was in danger of dying!    After the doctor's mustang had returned to proper behaviour, these odd  theories became the subject of discussion.  The Kentuckian believed in  them--the Englishman doubted them--the hunter-naturalist could not  endorse them--and Besancon ignored them entirely.    Shortly after the incident we entered the bottom lands of a considerable  stream.  These were heavily-timbered, and the shadow of the great forest  trees afforded us a pleasant relief from the hot sun.  Our guides told  us we had several miles of such woods to pass through, and we were glad  of the information.  We noticed that most of the trees were beech, and  their smooth straight trunks rose like columns around us.    The beech (_Fagus sylvatica_) is one of the most beautiful of American  forest trees.  Unlike most of the others, its bark is smooth, without  fissures, and often of a silvery hue.  Large beech-trees standing by the  path, or near a cross road, are often seen covered with names, initials,  and dates.  Even the Indian often takes advantage of the bark of a  beech-tree to signalise his presence to his friends, or commemorate some  savage exploit.  Indeed, the beautiful column-like trunk seems to invite  the knife, and many a souvenir is carved upon it by the loitering  wayfarer.  It does not, however, invite the axe of the settler.  On the  contrary, the beechen woods often remain untouched, while others fall  around them--partly because these trees are not usually the indices of  the richest soil, but more from the fact that clearing a piece of beech  forest is no easy matter.  The green logs do not burn so readily as  those of the oak, the elm, the maple, or poplar, and hence the necessity  of \"rolling\" them off the ground to be cleared--a serious thing where  labour is scarce and dear.    We were riding silently along, when all at once our ears were assailed  by a strange noise.  It resembled the clapping of a thousand pairs of  hands, followed by a whistling sound, as if a strong wind had set  suddenly in among the trees.  We all knew well enough what it meant, and  the simultaneous cry of \"pigeons,\" was followed by half a dozen  simultaneous cracks from the guns of the party, and several bluish birds  fell to the ground.  We had stumbled upon a feeding-place of the  passenger-pigeon (_Columba migratoria_).    Our route was immediately abandoned, and in a few minutes we were in the  thick of the flock, cracking away at them both with shot-gun and rifle.  It was not so easy, however, to bring them down in any considerable  numbers.  In following them up we soon strayed from each other, until  our party was completely scattered, and nearly two hours elapsed before  we got back to the road.  Our game-bag, however, made a fine show, and  about forty brace were deposited in the waggon.  With the anticipation  of roast pigeon and \"pot-pie,\" we rode on more cheerily to our  night-camp.  All along the route the pigeons were seen, and occasionally  large flocks whirled over our heads under the canopy of the trees.  Satiated with the sport, and not caring to waste our ammunition, we did  not heed them farther.    In order to give Lanty due time for the duties of the _cuisine_, we  halted a little earlier than usual.  Our day's march had been a short  one, but the excitement and sport of the pigeon-hunt repaid us for the  loss of time.  Our dinner-supper--for it was a combination of both--was  the dish known in America as \"pot-pie,\" in which the principal  ingredients were the pigeons, some soft flour paste, with a few slices  of bacon to give it a flavour.  Properly speaking, the \"pot-pie\" is not  a pie, but a stew.  Ours was excellent, and as our appetites wore in a  similar condition, a goodly quantity was used up in appeasing them.    Of course the conversation of the evening was the \"wild pigeon of  America,\" and the following facts regarding its natural history--  although many of them are by no means new--may prove interesting to the  reader, as they did to those who listened to the relation of them around  our camp-fire.    The \"passenger\" is less in size than the house pigeon.  In the air it  looks not unlike the kite, wanting the forked or \"swallow\" tail.  That  of the pigeon is cuneiform.  Its colour is best described by calling it  a nearly uniform slate.  In the male the colours are deeper, and the  neck-feathers present the same changeable hues of green, gold, and  purple-crimson, generally"]]]
