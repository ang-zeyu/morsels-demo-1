In character the native of  Venus is merry 'to a fault,' but of temper engaging, sweet and cheerful,  unless she be ill aspected, when her native is apt to be too fond of  pleasure and amusement. That her influence is good is shown (in the  opinion of Raphael, writing in 1828) by the character of George IV.,  'our present beloved monarch and most gracious majesty, who was born  just as this benevolent star' was in the ascendant; 'for it is well  known to all Europe what a refined and polished genius, and what  exquisite taste, the King of England possesses, which therefore may be  cited as a most illustrious proof of the celestial science; a proof  likewise which is palpably demonstrable, even to the most casual  observer, since the time of his nativity is taken from the public  journals of the period, and cannot be gainsaid.' 'This illustrious and  regal horoscope is replete with wonderful verifications of planetary  influence, and England cannot but prosper while she is blessed with the  mild and beneficent sway of this potent monarch.' Strengthened in faith  by this convincing proof of the celestial science, we proceed to notice  that Venus is the protectrice of musicians, embroiderers, perfumers,  classic modellers, and all who work in elegant attire or administer to  the luxuries of the great; but when she is afflicted, she represents  'the lower orders of the votaries of voluptuousness.'    Mercury is considered by astrologers 'a cold, dry, melancholy star.' The  Mercurial is neither dark nor fair, but between both, long-faced, with  high forehead and thin sharp nose, 'thin beard (many times none at all),  slender of body, and with small weak eyes;' long slender hands and  fingers are 'especial marks of Mercury,' says Raphael. In character the  Mercurial is busy and prattling. But when well affected, Mercury gives  his subjects a strong, vigorous, active mind, searching and exhaustive,  a retentive memory, a natural thirst for knowledge.[13] The persons  signified by Mercury are astrologers, philosophers, mathematicians,  politicians, merchants, travellers, teachers, poets, artificers, men of  science, and all ingenious, clever men. When he is ill affected,  however, he represents pettifoggers, cunning vile persons, thieves,  messengers, footmen, and servants, etc.    The moon comes last in planetary sequence, as nearest to the earth. She  is regarded by astrologers as a cold, moist, watery, phlegmatic planet,  variable to an extreme, and, like the sun, partaking of good or evil  according as she is aspected favourably or the reverse. Her natives are  of good stature, fair, and pale, moon-faced, with grey eyes, short arms,  thick hands and feet, smooth, corpulent and phlegmatic body. When she is  in watery signs, the native has freckles on the face, or, says Lilly,  'he or she is blub-cheeked, not a handsome body, but a muddling  creature.' Unless the moon is very well aspected, she ever signifies an  ordinary vulgar person. She signifies sailors (not as Mars does, the  fighting-men of war-ships, but nautical folk generally) and all persons  connected with water or any kind of fluid; also all who are engaged in  inferior and common offices.    We may note, in passing, that to each planet a special metal is  assigned, as also particular colours. Chaucer, in the Chanones Yemannes'  Tale, succinctly describes the distribution of the metals among the  planets:--      Sol gold is, and Luna silver we threpe;    Mars iren, Mercurie silver we clepe:    Saturnus led, and Jupiter is tin,    And Venus coper, by my [the Chanones Yemannes'] faderkin.    The colours are thus assigned:--to Saturn, black; to Jupiter, mixed red  and green; to Mars, red; to the sun, yellow or yellow-purple; to Venus,  white or purple; to Mercury, azure blue; to the moon, a colour spotted  with white and other mixed colours.    Again, the planets were supposed to have special influence on the seven  ages of human life. The infant, 'mewling and puking in the nurse's  arms,' was very appropriately dedicated to the moist moon; the whining  schoolboy (did schoolboys whine in the days of good Queen Bess?) was  less appropriately assigned to Mercury, the patron of those who eagerly  seek after knowledge: then very naturally, the lover sighing like  furnace was regarded as the special favourite of Venus. Thus far the  order has been that of the seven planets of the ancient astrology, in  supposed distance. Now, however, we have to pass over the sun, finding  Mars the patron of mid life, appropriately (in this respect) presiding  over the soldier full of strange oaths, and so forth; the 'justice in  fair round belly with good capon lined' is watched over by the  respectable sun; maturer age by Jupiter; and, lastly, old age by Saturn.    Colours were also assigned to the twelve zodiacal signs--to Aries, white  and red; to Taurus, white and lemon; to Gemini, white and red (the same  as Aries); to Cancer, green or russet; to Leo, red or green; to Virgo,  black speckled with blue; to Libra, black, or dark crimson, or tawny  colour; to Scorpio, brown; to Sagittarius, yellow, or a green sanguine  (this is as strange a colour as the _gris rouge_ of Moliere's  _L'Avare_); Capricorn, black or russet, or a swarthy brown; to Aquarius,  a sky-coloured blue; to Pisces, white glistening colour (like a fish  just taken out of the water).    The chief fixed stars had various influences assigned to them by  astrologers. These influences were mostly associated with the imaginary  figures of the constellations. Thus the bright star in the head of  Aries, called by some the Ram's Horn, was regarded as dangerous and  evil, denoting bodily hurts. The star Menkar in the Whale's jaw denoted  sickness, disgrace, and ill-fortune, with danger from great beasts.  Betelgeux, the bright star on Orion's right shoulder, denoted martial  honours or wealth; Bellatrix, the star on Orion's left shoulder, denoted  military or civic honours; Rigel, on Orion's left foot, denoted honours;  Sirius and Procyon, the greater and lesser Dog Stars, both implied  wealth and renown. Star clusters seem to have portended loss of sight;  at least we learn that the Pleiades were 'eminent stars,' but denoting  accidents to the sight or blindness, while the cluster Praesepe or the  Beehive in like manner threatened blindness. The cluster in Perseus does  not seem to have been noticed by astrologers. The variable star Algol or  Caput Medusae, which marks the head of Gorgon, was accounted 'the most  unfortunate, violent, and dangerous star in the heavens.' It is  tolerably clear that the variable character of this star had been  detected long before Montanari (to whom the discovery is commonly  attributed) noticed the phenomenon. The name Algol is only a variation  of Al-ghul, the monster or demon, and it cannot be doubted that the  demoniac, Gorgonian character assigned to this star was suggested by its  ominous change, as though it were the eye of some fierce monster slowly  winking amid the gloom of space. The two stars called the Aselli, which  lie on either side of the cluster Praesepe, 'are said' (by astrologers)  'to be of a burning nature, and to give great indications of a violent  death, or of violent and severe accidents by fire.' The star called Cor  Hydrae, or the serpent's heart, denotes trouble through women (said I not  rightly that Astrology was a masculine science?); the Lion's heart,  Regulus, implied glory and riches; Deneb, the Lion's tail, misfortune  and disgrace. The southern scale of Libra meant bad fortune, while the  northern was eminently fortunate.    Astrology was divided into three distinct branches--the doctrine of  nativities, horary astrology, and state astrology. The first assigned  the rules for determining the general fortunes of the native, by drawing  up his scheme of nativity or casting his horoscope. It took into account  the positions of the various planets, signs, stars, etc., at the time of  the native's birth; and as the astrologer could calculate the movements  of the planets thereafter, he could find when those planets which were  observed by the horoscope to be most closely associated with the  native's fortunes would be well aspected or the reverse. Thus the  auspicious and unlucky epochs of the native's life could be  predetermined. The astrologer also claimed some degree of power to rule  the planets, not by modifying their movements in any way, but by  indicating in what way the ill effects portended by their positions  could be prevented. The Arabian and Persian astrologers, having less  skill than the followers of Ptolemy, made use of a different method of  determining the fortunes of men, not calculating the positions of the  planets for many years following the birth of the native, but assigning  to every day after his birth a whole year of his life and for every two  hours' motion of the moon one month. Thus the positions of the stars and  planets, twenty-one days after the birth of the native, would indicate  the events corresponding to the time when he would have completed his  twenty-first year. There was another system called the Placidian, in  which the effects of the positions of the planets were judged with sole  reference to the motion of the earth upon her axis. It is satisfactory  to find astrologers in harmony amongst each other as to these various  methods, which one would have supposed likely to give entirely different  results. 'Each of them,' says a modern astrologer, 'is not only correct  and approved by long-tried practice, but may be said to defy the least  contradiction from those who will but take the pains to examine them  (and no one else should deliver an opinion upon the subject). Although  each of the above methods are different, yet they by no means contradict  each other, but each leads to _true results_, and in many instances they  each lead to the foreknowledge"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26558"],[0,"Pennsylvania Dutch Cooking (#7)"],[1,"cracker.
