It is a fact, however, that we every day experience; you know how it  fades the colours of linens and silks.    EMILY.    Certainly. And I recollect that endive is made to grow white instead of  green, by being covered up so as to exclude the light. But by what means  does light produce these effects?    MRS. B.    This I cannot attempt to explain to you until you have obtained a  further knowledge of chemistry. As the chemical properties of light can  be accounted for only in their reference to compound bodies, it would be  useless to detain you any longer on this subject; we may therefore pass  on to the examination of heat, or caloric, with which we are somewhat  better acquainted.    HEAT and LIGHT may be always distinguished by the different sensations  they produce, _Light_ affects the sense of sight; _Caloric_ that of  feeling; the one produces _Vision_, the other the sensation of _Heat_.    Caloric is found to exist in a variety of forms or modifications, and I  think it will be best to consider it under the two following heads, viz.    1. FREE OR RADIANT CALORIC.    2. COMBINED CALORIC.    The first, FREE or RADIANT CALORIC, is also called HEAT OF TEMPERATURE;  it comprehends all heat which is perceptible to the senses, and affects  the thermometer.    EMILY.    You mean such as the heat of the sun, of fire, of candles, of stoves; in  short, of every thing that burns?    MRS. B.    And likewise of things that do not burn, as, for instance, the warmth of  the body; in a word, all heat that is _sensible_, whatever may be its  degree, or the source from which it is derived.    CAROLINE.    What then are the other modifications of caloric? It must be a strange  kind of heat that cannot be perceived by our senses.    MRS. B.    None of the modifications of caloric should properly be called _heat_;  for heat, strictly speaking, is the sensation produced by caloric, on  animated bodies; this word, therefore, in the accurate language of  science, should be confined to express the sensation. But custom has  adapted it likewise to inanimate matter, and we say _the heat of an  oven_, _the heat of the sun_, without any reference to the sensation  which they are capable of exciting.    It was in order to avoid the confusion which arose from thus confounding  the cause and effect, that modern chemists adopted the new word  _caloric_, to denote the principle which produces heat; yet they do not  always, in compliance with their own language, limit the word _heat_ to  the expression of the sensation, since they still frequently employ it  in reference to the other modifications of caloric which are quite  independent of sensation.    CAROLINE.    But you have not yet explained to us what these other modifications of  caloric are.    MRS. B.    Because you are not acquainted with the properties of free caloric, and  you know that we have agreed to proceed with regularity.    One of the most remarkable properties of free caloric is its power of  _dilating_ bodies. This fluid is so extremely subtle, that it enters and  pervades all bodies whatever, forces itself between their particles, and  not only separates them, but frequently drives them asunder to a  considerable distance from each other. It is thus that caloric dilates  or expands a body so as to make it occupy a greater space than it did  before.    EMILY.    The effect it has on bodies, therefore, is directly contrary to that of  the attraction of cohesion; the one draws the particles together, the  other drives them asunder.    MRS. B.    Precisely. There is a continual struggle between the attraction of  aggregation, and the expansive power of caloric; and from the action of  these two opposite forces, result all the various forms of matter, or  degrees of consistence, from the solid, to the liquid and aeriform  state. And accordingly we find that most bodies are capable of passing  from one of these forms to the other, merely in consequence of their  receiving different quantities of caloric.    CAROLINE.    That is very curious; but I think I understand the reason of it. If a  great quantity of caloric is added to a solid body, it introduces itself  between the particles in such a manner as to overcome, in a considerable  degree, the attraction of cohesion; and the body, from a solid, is then  converted into a fluid.    MRS. B.    This is the case whenever a body is fused or melted; but if you add  caloric to a liquid, can you tell me what is the consequence?    CAROLINE.    The caloric forces itself in greater abundance between the particles of  the fluid, and drives them to such a distance from each other, that  their attraction of aggregation is wholly destroyed: the liquid is then  transformed into vapour.    MRS. B.    Very well; and this is precisely the case with boiling water, when it is  converted into steam or vapour, and with all bodies that assume an  aeriform state.    EMILY.    I do not well understand the word aeriform?    MRS. B.    Any elastic fluid whatever, whether it be merely vapour or permanent  air, is called aeriform.    But each of these various states, solid, liquid, and aeriform, admit of  many different degrees of density, or consistence, still arising  (chiefly at least) from the different quantities of caloric the bodies  contain. Solids are of various degrees of density, from that of gold, to  that of a thin jelly. Liquids, from the consistence of melted glue, or  melted metals, to that of ether, which is the lightest of all liquids.  The different elastic fluids (with which you are not yet acquainted) are  susceptible of no less variety in their degrees of density.    EMILY.    But does not every individual body also admit of different degrees of  consistence, without changing its state?    MRS. B.    Undoubtedly; and this I can immediately show you by a very simple  experiment. This piece of iron now exactly fits the frame, or ring, made  to receive it; but if heated red hot, it will no longer do so, for its  dimensions will be so much increased by the caloric that has penetrated  into it, that it will be much too large for the frame.    The iron is now red hot; by applying it to the frame, we shall see how  much it is dilated.    EMILY.    Considerably so indeed! I knew that heat had this effect on bodies, but  I did not imagine that it could be made so conspicuous.    MRS. B.    By means of this instrument (called a Pyrometer) we may estimate, in the  most exact manner, the various dilatations of any solid body by heat.  The body we are now going to submit to trial is this small iron bar;  I fix it to this apparatus, (PLATE I. Fig. 1.) and then heat it by  lighting the three lamps beneath it: when the bar expands, it increases  in length as well as thickness; and, as one end communicates with this  wheel-work, whilst the other end is fixed and immoveable, no sooner does  it begin to dilate than it presses against the wheel-work, and sets in  motion the index, which points out the degrees of dilatation on the  dial-plate.      [Illustration: Plate I. Vol. I. p. 38.      Fig. 1. Pyrometer.    A.A Bar of Metal.    1.2.3 Lamps burning.    B.B Wheel work.    C Index.      Fig. 2    A.A Glass tubes with bulbs.    B.B Glasses of water in which they are immersed.]    EMILY.    This is, indeed, a very curious instrument; but I do not understand the  use of the wheels: would it not be more simple, and answer the purpose  equally well, if the bar, in dilating, pressed against the index, and  put it in motion without the intervention of the wheels?    MRS. B.    The use of the wheels is merely to multiply the motion, and therefore  render the effect of the caloric more obvious; for if the index moved no  more than the bar increased in length, its motion would scarcely be  perceptible; but by means of the wheels it moves in a much greater  proportion, which therefore renders the variations far more conspicuous.    By submitting different bodies to the test of the pyrometer, it is found  that they are far from dilating in the same proportion. Different metals  expand in different degrees, and other kinds of solid bodies vary still  more in this respect. But this different susceptibility of dilatation is  still more remarkable in fluids than in solid bodies, as I shall show  you. I have here two glass tubes, terminated at one end by large bulbs.  We shall fill the bulbs, the one with spirit of wine, the other with  water. I have coloured both liquids, in order that the effect may be  more conspicuous. The spirit of wine, you see, dilates by the warmth of  my hand as I hold the bulb.    EMILY.    It certainly does, for I see it is rising into the tube. But water, it  seems, is not so easily affected by heat; for scarcely any change is  produced on it by the warmth of the hand.    MRS. B.    True; we shall now plunge the bulbs into hot water, (PLATE I. Fig. 2.)  and you will see both liquids rise in the tubes; but the spirit of wine  will ascend highest.    CAROLINE.    How rapidly it expands! Now it has nearly reached the top of the tube,  though the water has hardly begun to rise.    EMILY.    The water now begins to dilate. Are not these glass tubes, with liquids  rising within them, very like thermometers?    MRS. B.    A thermometer is constructed exactly on the same principle, and these  tubes require only a scale to answer the purpose of thermometers: but  they would be rather awkward in their dimensions. The tubes and bulbs of  thermometers, though of various sizes, are in general much smaller than  these; the tube too is hermetically closed, and the air excluded from  it. The fluid most generally used in thermometers is mercury, commonly  called quicksilver, the dilatations and contractions of which correspond  more exactly to the additions, and subtractions, of caloric, than those  of any other fluid.    CAROLINE.    Yet I have often seen coloured spirit of wine used in thermometers.    MRS. B.    The expansions and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26912"],[0,"Report of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee (#7)"],[1," business of importing books be required to supply to that      Department a list of the publishers whose books he imports.        \"(4) There is one anomaly in section 5 (1) (_d_) of the principal      Act as set out in the 1954 Act. This is the provision which      requires the Magistrate to take account of the persons, classes, or      age groups to whom a document is sold or is intended or likely to      be sold _and the tendency of the document to deprave or corrupt      such persons_. The words in italics are appropriate in the      Victorian statute from which they were copied because the      common-law test of depraving or corrupting applies in Victoria, but      they are at best unnecessary in New Zealand where the Act lays down      its own test--namely, that the act of the defendant must be of an      'immoral or mischievous tendency'.        \"(5) The 1954 Amendment contains some ambiguities and anomalies in      matters of detail which should be remedied when any further      legislation is brought down. These defects were discussed in an      article by Professor I. D. Campbell in the 1955 _New Zealand Law      Journal_, page 294.        \"_New Provisions Suggested_: (1) As we have said, we are not      anxious that the ordinary law-abiding bookseller or distributor      should have to undergo the stigma of a criminal prosecution, and      this was the main reason for entering into arrangements with the      Associated Booksellers and Gordon and Gotch. At present, however,      criminal proceedings afford the only real way of testing the      position even where there is an honest difference of opinion. We      think a better procedure could be devised, and the Select Committee      may be invited to deal with this matter.        \"(2) A number of comics which are not strictly indecent within the      meaning of the Act are nevertheless objectionable from other points      of view. In many the ethical standards of the characters are low.      The quality of the print and illustrations varies from the      indifferent to the very poor, and must have a serious effect on      children's eyesight. In a number of comics the grammar and      vocabulary are likewise bad.        \"It is said that children learn from what they see and hear around      them. If this is so it would appear that the assiduous reading of      comics tends to counteract the work of teachers which costs the      country so much.        \"An Inter-departmental Committee in 1952 recommended the      introduction of a system of registration. The Committee's original      recommendations were: that publishers or importers of comics should      apply for registration of every title and that only suitable titles      should be registered. The sale of unregistered comics was to be an      offence. This procedure may be preferable to the subsequently      suggested system of automatic registration followed by      de-registration upon complaint.        \"Registration of comics, of course, amounts to censorship. There      is, however, no question of literary merit or the spread of      knowledge, and the view that an adult should in general be free to      read what he likes does not apply in the case of publications      primarily intended for children. If it is accepted as proper to      censor films there can be little objection to censoring comics.        \"We therefore suggest that the Select Committee might consider      whether an authority might be set up to approve and register      comics. There could be an Appeal Board similar to that in respect      of films to consider complaints against any decision of the      registering authority.        \"If this suggestion is unacceptable an alternative might be an      amendment to the legislation to be introduced enabling the Court in      the case of comics to take into account as one of the factors in      considering whether they are objectionable matters of grammar,      language and visual standards.\"    The present Committee is of opinion that there is a good deal of force  in the suggestions put forward in this part of the report of the  Department of Justice, and our view is that these suggestions should be  referred to the Minister of Education with a request that he consider  them favourably and forward his conclusions to the Government.        \"(3) We have come across cases in which publications have been      advertised to such persons and in such a way as to endeavour to      sell them or attract the public on the basis of their emphasis or      alleged emphasis on sex, horror or violence.        \"If a publication--for instance, a medical book--is displayed in a      shop window open at a page of illustrations this would probably be      an offence against the present law even though the book may itself      be unobjectionable. There is however, another type of case which      would not be caught by the law as it stands, but which we think      equally deserves to be prohibited. An example of what we have in      mind is an advertisement which is put out by a mail-order firm and      is obviously designed to 'sell the book on its sex.' This open      appeal to salacious instincts is most objectionable and we can see      no justification for allowing it. Whether or not the publication      itself is indecent, we think the type of advertisement we refer to      should be prohibited by law.        \"_Amendments of Principal Act_: Prior to 1954 the Indecent      Publications Act 1910 had stood without alteration for over forty      years, and although its main principles are still sound revision is      badly needed. Indeed, last year's amendment in certain respects      increased rather than decreased the difficulties. In our opinion,      the best solution is to reconsider the legislation as a whole and      to deal with the topic of objectionable publications in a new and      self-contained Act. This would, of course, take some time. We have      notes of many points to raise with the draftsman, but we cite      others of more general significance.        \"(1) We consider that parts of the present section 6 are obsolete      and should be repealed. Section 6 enumerates certain classes of      works which are _prima facie_ indecent. Among these are 'any      document or matter which relates or refers, or may reasonably be      supposed to relate or refer, to any disease affecting the      generative organs of either sex, or to any complaint or infirmity      arising from or relating to sexual intercourse, or to the      prevention or removal of irregularities in menstruation'.        \"In so far as this part of the section would prevent the      advertising of useless or harmful products, it is unnecessary in      view of the Medical Advertisements Act 1942. In so far as it      represents a general attitude it seems out of date now that the      matters referred to are discussed with far less reticence than when      the Act was passed. The reference to drugs or methods for procuring      abortion or miscarriage in the later part of the section might be      retained, but it belongs more properly in the Crimes Act or the      Police Offences Act.        \"(2) At present section 157 of the Crimes Act overlaps the      provisions of the Indecent Publications Act 1910, and the tests it      lays down are expressed in very different language. This section is      little used, but it seems undesirable that there should be two      different tests for what is really the same offence. We recommend      the repeal of section 157 in so far as its subject matter overlaps      the Indecent Publications Act 1910.        \"(3) If the legislation is rewritten, we suggest that consideration      be given to the incorporation in the Act of the 'dominant effect'      test laid down in an American case, the Ulysses case.        \"The consolidation and rewriting of the existing legislation would      be of real benefit. The nature of the topic, however, demands that      any general consolidation should receive careful and even cautious      consideration. We do not think that in this matter urgent or speedy      action is called for.\"    The Committee has examined all of these suggestions and recommends that  they should receive the very favourable consideration of the Government.      Summary of Principal Conclusions and Recommendations    I. That the changes in the law which were regarded by the Mazengarb  Committee as calling for immediate action were duly and promptly  brought into being by the Government by and through its 1954 amendments  to the Indecent Publications Act 1910, the Child Welfare Act 1925, and  the Police Offences Act 1927.    II. That the changes made last year in the Indecent Publications Act  1910 have been to some extent effective and helpful. We recommend,  however, that consideration be given by Government to the redrafting of  the Indecent Publications Act 1910 and to the inclusion in any new  draft of the amendments suggested by the Department of Justice.    III. That it is clear that the suggestions made by the Mazengarb  Committee for administrative action by certain named Government  Departments along the lines indicated by that Committee have  been sympathetically studied by the several Departments and that  satisfactory measures have been taken by such Departments to carry  out the recommendations of that Committee.    IV. That in the opinion of the present Committee the Child Welfare  Division should not be reconstituted as a separate and independent  Department of State, but that it should remain, as at present, a Branch  or Division of the Department of Education.    V. That Government should take effective steps to set up a broadly  based committee composed of men and/or women of expert knowledge and  possessed of specialized training and wide experience to act as a  fact-finding body so that as far as possible a reliable diagnosis may  be obtained of the"]]]
