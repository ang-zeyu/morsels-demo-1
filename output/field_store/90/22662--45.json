On the last day of August, very few of the holes were open. A number of  Oil beetles were strolling suspiciously about in the neighborhood, and  some little black Ichneumon flies were seen running about among the  holes.    During mid-summer the holes were found closed night and day by clods of  earth.    The burrow is sunken perpendicularly, with short passages leading to the  cells, which are slightly inclined downwards and outwards from the main  gallery. The walls of the gallery are rough, but the cells are lined  with a mucous-like secretion, which, on hardening, looks like the  glazing of earthenware. This glazing is quite hard, and breaks up into  angular pieces. It is evidently the work of the bee herself, and is not  secreted and laid on by the larva. The diameter of the interior of the  cell is about one-quarter of an inch, contracting a little at the mouth.  When the cell is taken out, the dirt adheres for a line in thickness, so  that it is of the size and form of an acorn.    The larva of Andrena (Fig. 29) is soft and fleshy, like that of the  Honey bee. Its body is flattened, bulging out prominently at the sides,  and tapering more rapidly than usual towards each end of the body. The  skin is very thin, so that along the back the heart or dorsal vessel may  be distinctly seen, pulsating about sixty times a minute.    Our cut (Fig. 28, _a_) also represents the pupa, or chrysalis, as seen  lying in its cell. The limbs are folded close to the body in the most  compact way possible. On the head of the semi-pupa, _i.e._, a transition  state between the larva and pupa, there are two prominent tubercles  situated behind the simple eyes, or ocelli; these are deciduous organs,  apparently aiding the insect in moving about its cell. They disappear in  the mature pupa.    [Illustration: Fig. 29. Fig. 30. Fig. 31.    Fig. 31. Larva of Halictus parallelus.    Fig. 29. Larva of Andrena vicina.    Fig. 30. Pupa of Halictus parallelus seen from beneath.]    To those accustomed to rearing butterflies, and seeing the chrysalis at  once assuming its perfected shape, after the caterpillar skin is thrown  off, it may seem strange to hear one speak of a \"half-pupa,\" and of  stages intermediate between the larva and pupa. But the external changes  of form, though rapidly passed through, consisting apparently of a mere  sloughing off of the outer skin, are yet preceded by slow and very  gradual alterations of tissues, resulting from the growth of cells. An  inner layer of the larva-skin separates from the outer, and, by changes  in the form of the muscles, is drawn into different positions, such as  is assumed by the pupa, which thus lies concealed beneath the  larva-skin. But a slight alteration is made in the general form of the  larva, consisting mostly of an enlargement of the thoracic segments,  which is often overlooked, even by the special student, though of great  interest to the philosophic naturalist.    From Mr. Emerton's observations we should judge that the pupa state  lasted from three to four weeks, as the larvae began to transform the  first of August, and appeared during the last week of the same month as  perfect bees.    The Andrena is seen as late as the first week in September, and again  early in April, about the flowers of the willow. It is one of the  largest of its genus and a common species.    Having, in a very fragmentary way, sketched the life history of our  Andrena and had some glimpses of its subterranean life, let us now  compare with it another genus of solitary bee (Halictus), quite closely  allied in all respects, though a little lower in the scale.    The Halictus parallelus excavates cells almost exactly like those of  Andrena; but since the bee is smaller, the holes are smaller, though as  deep. Mr. Emerton found one nest in a path a foot in depth. Another  nest, discovered September 9th, was about six inches deep. The cells are  in form like those of Andrena, and like them, are glazed within. The egg  is rather slenderer and much curved; in form it is long, cylindrical,  obtuse at one end, and much smaller at the other. The larva (Fig. 31) is  longer and slenderer, being quite different from the rather broad and  flattened larva of Andrena. The body is rather thick behind, but in  front tapers slowly towards the head, which is of moderate size. Its  body is somewhat tuberculated, the tubercle aiding the grub in moving  about its cell. Its length is nearly one-half (.40) of an inch. On the  pupa are four quite distinct conical tubercles forming a transverse line  just in front of the ocelli; and there are also two larger, longer  tubercles, on the outer side of each of which, an ocellus is situated.  Figure 30 represents the pupa seen from beneath.    Search was made on July 16th, where the ground was hard as stone for six  inches in depth, below which the soil was soft and fine, and over twenty  cells were dug out. \"The upper cells contained nearly mature pupae, and  the lower ones, larvae of various sizes, the smallest being hardly  distinguishable by the naked eye. Each of these small larvae was in a  cell by itself, and situated upon a lump of pollen, which was the size  and shape of a pea, and was found to lessen in size as the larva grew  larger. These young were probably the offspring of several females, as  four mature bees were found in the hole.\" The larva of an English  species hatches in ten days after the eggs are laid.    Another brood of bees appeared the middle of September, as on the ninth  of that month (1864) Mr. Emerton found several holes of the same species  of bee, made in a hard gravel road near the turnpike. When opened, they  were found to contain several bees with their young. September 2nd, of  this year, the same kind of bee was found in holes, and just ready to  leave the cell. It is probable that these bees winter over.    We have incidentally noticed the presence in the nests of Andrena and  Halictus of a stranger bee, clad in gay, fantastic hues, which lives a  parasitic life on its hosts. This parasitism does not go far enough to  cause the death of the host, since we find the young of the parasitic  Cuckoo bee, in cells containing the young of the former.    Mr. F. Smith, in his \"Catalogue of British Bees,\" says of this genus:  \"No one appears to know anything beyond the mere fact of their entering  the burrows of Andrenidae and Apidae, except that they are found in the  cells of the working bees in their perfect condition: it is most  probable that they deposit their eggs on the provision laid up by the  working bee, that they close up the cell, and that the working bee,  finding an egg deposited, commences a fresh cell for her own progeny.\"    He has, however, found two specimens of Nomada, sexfasciata in the cells  of the long-horned bee, Eucera longicornis. He also states, that while  some species are constant in their attacks on certain Halicti and  Andrenae, others attack different species of these genera  indiscriminately. In like manner another Cuckoo bee (Coelioxys) is  parasitic on Megachile and Saropoda; Stelis is a parasite on Osmia, the  Mason bee: and Melecta infests the cells of Anthophora.    The observations of Mr. Emerton enable us still further to clear up the  history of this obscure visitor. He found both the larva and pupa, as  well as the perfect bee, in the cells of both genera; so that either  both kinds of bee, when hatched from eggs laid in the same cell, feed on  the same pollen mass, which therefore barely suffices for the  nourishment of both; or the hostess, discovering the strange egg laid,  cuckoo-like, in her own nest, has the forethought to deposit another  ball of pollen to secure the safety of her young.    Is such an act the operation of a blind instinct? Does it not rather  ally our little bee with those higher animals which undoubtedly possess  a reasoning power? Its _instinct_ teaches it to build cells, and prepare  its pollen mass, and lay an egg thereon. Its _reason_ enables it, in  such an instance as this, when the life of the brood is threatened, to  guard against any such danger by means to which it does not habitually  resort. This instance is paralleled by the case of our common summer  Yellow bird, which, on finding an egg of the Cow bunting in its nest,  often builds a new nest above it, to the certain destruction of the  unwelcome egg in the nest beneath.    In the structure of the bee, and in all its stages of growth, our  parasite seems lower in the zooelogical scale than its host. It is  structurally a degraded form of Working-bee, and its position socially  is unenviable. It is lazy, not having the provident habits of the  Working-bees; it aids not in the least, so far as we know, the  cross-fertilization of plants--one great office in the economy of nature  which most bees perform,--since it is not a pollen-gatherer, but on the  contrary is seemingly a drag and hinderance to the course of nature. But  yet nature kindly, and as if by a special interposition, provides for  its maintenance, and the humble naturalist can only exclaim, \"God is  great, and his ways mysterious,\" and go on studying and collecting  facts, leaving to his successors the more difficult task, but greater  joy of discovering the cause and reason of things that are but a puzzle  to the philosophers of this day.    The larva of Nomada may be known from those of its host, by its  slenderer body and smaller head, while the body is smoother and more  cylindrical. Both sexes of Nomada imbricata and N. pulchella were found  by Mr. Emerton, the former in both the Andrena and Halictus nests, and  both were found in a single Andrena nest.

One is called the Abert Squirrel and the other the  Kaibab Squirrel.  They are about the size of Happy Jack and Rusty  but have broader, handsomer tails and their ears have long tufts  of hair.  The Abert Squirrel has black ears, a brown back, gray  sides and white underneath.  Kaibab has brown ears with black  tips, and his tail is mostly white.  Both are very lovely, but  their families are small and so they are little known.\"    With this, Old Mother Nature dismissed school for the day.        CHAPTER VI  Striped Chipmunk and his Cousins    Of course there couldn't be a school in the Green Forest without  news of it spreading very fast.  News travels quickly through the  Green Forest and over the Green Meadows, for the little people who  live there are great gossips.  So it was not surprising that Striped  Chipmunk heard all about Old Mother Nature's school.  The next  morning, just as the daily lesson was beginning, Striped Chipmunk  came hurrying up, quite our of breath.    \"Well, well!  See who's here!\" exclaimed Old Mother Nature.  \"What  have you come for, Striped Chipmunk?\"    \"I've come to try to learn.  Will you let me stay, Mother Nature?\"  replied Striped Chipmunk.    \"Of course I'll let you stay,\" cried Old Mother Nature heartily.  \"I am glad you have come, especially glad you have come today,  because to-day's lesson is to be about you and your cousins.  Now,  Peter Rabbit, what are the differences between Striped Chipmunk  and his cousins, the Tree Squirrels?\"    Peter looked very hard at Striped Chipmunk as if he had never really  seen him before.  \"He is smaller than they are,\" began Peter.  \"In  fact, he is the smallest Squirrel I know.\"  Peter paused.    Old Mother Nature nodded encouragingly.  \"Go on,\" said she.    \"He wears a striped coat,\" continued Peter.  \"The stripes are black  and yellowish-white and run along his sides, a black stripe running  down the middle of his back.  The rest of his coat is reddish-brown  above and light underneath.  His tail is rather thin and flat.  I  never see him in the trees, so I guess he can't climb.\"    \"Oh, yes, I can,\" interrupted Striped Chipmunk.  \"I can climb if I  want to, and I do sometimes, but prefer the ground.\"    \"Go on, Peter,\" said Old Mother Nature.    \"He seems to like old stone walls and rock piles,\" continued Peter,  \"and he is one of the brightest, liveliest, merriest and the most  lovable of all my friends.\"    \"Thank you, Peter,\" said Striped Chipmunk softly.    \"I never have been able to find his home,\" continued Peter.  \"That is  one of his secrets.  But I know it is in the ground.  I guess this  is all I know about him.  I should say the chief difference between  Striped Chipmunk and the Tree Squirrels is that he spends all his  time on the ground while the others live largely in the trees.\"    \"Very good, Peter,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"But there are two  very important differences which you have not mentioned.  Striped  Chipmunk has a big pocket on the inside of each cheek, while his  cousins of the trees have no pockets at all.\"    \"Of course,\" cried Peter.  \"I don't see how I came to forget that.  I've laughed many times at Striped Chipmunk with those pockets  stuffed with nuts or seeds until his head looked three times bigger  than it does now.  Those pockets must be very handy.\"    \"They are,\" replied Striped Chipmunk.  \"I couldn't get along without  them.  They save me a lot of running back and forth, I can tell you.\"    \"And the other great difference,\" said Old Mother Nature, \"is  that Striped Chipmunk sleeps nearly all winter, just waking up  occasionally to pop his head out on a bright day to see how the  weather is.  A great many folks call Striped Chipmunk a Ground  Squirrel, but more properly he is a Rock Squirrel because he  likes stony places best.  Supposing, Striped Chipmunk, you tell  us where and how you make your home.\"    \"I make my home down in the ground,\" replied Striped Chipmunk.  \"I  dig a tunnel just big enough to run along comfortably.  Down deep  enough to be out of reach of Jack Frost I make a nice little  bedroom with a bed of grass and leaves, and I make another little  room for a storeroom in which to keep my supply of seeds and nuts.  Sometimes I have more than one storeroom.  Also I have some little  side tunnels.\"    \"But why is it I never have been able to find the entrance to your  tunnel?\" asked Peter, as full of curiosity as ever.    \"Because I have it hidden underneath the stone wall on the edge of  the Old Orchard,\" replied Striped Chipmunk.    \"But even then, I should think that all the sand you must have  taken out would give your secret away,\" cried Peter.    Striped Chipmunk chuckled happily.  It was a throaty little chuckle,  pleasant to hear.  \"I looked out for that,\" said he.  \"There isn't  a grain of that sand around my doorway.  I took it all out through  another hole some distance away, a sort of back door, and then  closed it up solidly.  If you please, Mother Nature, if I am not  a Ground Squirrel, who is?\"    \"Your cousin, Seek Seek the Spermophile, sometimes called Gopher  Squirrel, who lives on the open plains of the West where there are  no rocks or stones.  He likes best the flat, open country.  He is  called Spermophile because that means seed-eater, and he lives  largely on seeds, especially on grain.  Because of this he does a  great deal of damage and is much disliked by farmers.    \"Seek Seek's family are the true Ground Squirrels.  Please remember  that they never should be called Gophers, for they are not Gophers.  One of the smallest members of the family is just about your size,  Striped Chipmunk, and he also wears stripes, only he has more of  them than you have, and they are broken up into little dots.  He  is called the Thirteen-lined Spermophile.  He has pockets in his  cheeks just as you have, and he makes a home down in the ground  very similar to yours.  All the family do this, and all of them  sleep through the winter.  While they are great seed-eaters they  also eat a great many insects and worms, and some of them even  are guilty of killing and eating the babies of birds that nest  on the ground, and also young mice.    \"Some members of the family are almost as big as Happy Jack the  Gray Squirrel and have gray coats.  They are called Gray Ground  Squirrels and sometimes Gray Gophers.  One of the largest of these  is the California Ground Squirrel.  He has a big, bushy tail, very  like Happy Jack's.  He gets into so much mischief in the grain  fields and in the orchards that he is quite as much disliked as is  Jack Rabbit.  This particular member of the family is quite as much  at home among rocks and tree roots as in open ground.  He climbs low  trees for fruit and nuts, but prefers to stay on the ground.  Now  just remember that the Chipmunks are Rock Squirrels and their cousins  the Spermophiles are Ground Squirrels.  Now who of you has seen Timmy  the Flying Squirrel lately?\"    \"I haven't,\" said Peter Rabbit.    \"I haven't,\" said Striped Chipmunk.    \"I haven't,\" said Happy Jack.    \"I haven't,\" said Chatterer.    \"I have,\" spoke up Jumper the Hare.  \"I saw him last evening just  after jolly, round, red Mr. Sun went to bed behind the Purple Hills  and the Black Shadows came creeping through the Green Forest.  My,  I wish I could fly the way he can!\"    Old Mother Nature shook her head disapprovingly.  \"Jumper,\" said she,  \"what is wrong with your eyes?  When did you ever see Timmy fly?\"    \"Last night,\" insisted Jumper stubbornly.    \"Oh, no, you didn't,\" retorted Old Mother Nature.  \"You didn't see  him fly, for the very good reason that he cannot fly any more than  you can.  You saw him simply jump.  Just remember that the only  animals in this great land who can fly are the Bats.  Timmy the  Flying Squirrel simply jumps from the top of a tree and slides down  on the air to the foot of another tree.  If you had used your eyes  you would have noticed that when he is in the air he never moves  his legs or arms, and he is always coming down, never going up,  excepting for a little at the end of his jump, as would be the case  if he could really fly.  He hasn't any wings.\"    \"When he's flying, I mean jumping, he looks as if he had wings,\"  insisted Jumper stubbornly.    \"That is simply because I have given him a fold of skin between the  front and hind leg on each side,\" explained Old Mother Nature.  \"When he jumps he stretches his legs out flat, and that stretches  out those two folds of skin until they look almost like wings.  This is the reason he can sail so far when he jumps from a high  place.  You've seen a bird, after flapping its wings to get going,  sail along with them outstretched and motionless.  Timmy does the  same thing, only he gets going by jumping.  You may have noticed  that he usually goes to the top of a tree before jumping; then he  can sail down a wonderfully long distance.  His tail helps him to  keep his balance.  If there is anything in the way, he can steer  himself around it.  When he reaches the tree he is jumping for he  shoots up a little way and lands on the trunk not far above the  ground.  Then he scampers up that tree to do it all over again.\"    \"But why don't we ever see him?\" inquired Striped Chipmunk.    \"Because, when the rest of you squirrels are out and about, he is  curled up in a little ball in his nest, fast asleep.  Timmy likes  the night, especially the early evening, and doesn't like the  light of day.\"    \"How big is he?\" asked Happy Jack, and looked a little sheepish as  if he were a wee bit ashamed of not being acquainted with one of  his own cousins.    \"He is, if anything, a little smaller than Striped Chipmunk,\"  replied Old Mother Nature.  \"Way out in the Far West he grows a  little bigger.  His coat is a soft yellowish-brown above; beneath  he is all white.  His fur is"]]]
