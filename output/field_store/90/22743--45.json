And yet there must always have been naughty children asking  pointed questions, for it was long ago found necessary to try to scare  them by a divine fulmination. Honor thy father and thy mother that thy  days may be long! It seems that even so long ago parents were afraid  they could not win honor from their children. Abraham's place was on the  pile, just as it is the place of the modern parent who looks upon his  child as his chattel; disposing of him as he will; arbitrarily making  rules for his conduct which he would not dream of observing for himself;  stifling his natural demands for knowledge; converting what is pure and  most beautiful in the world into a mire of filth and ignorance; wilfully  robbing him of his birthright of individuality by forcing him to conform  to methods of thought and conduct which his own experience tells him no  man can or does conform to from the moment he wins his freedom or learns  the hideous lesson of that hypocrisy which he is sure in the end to  discover that his father practices. What right has any father to make a  sacrifice of his child? What is his title to the love or gratitude or  self-abnegation of his child? Is it that the child is the unconsidered  consequence of the legal rape of some poor woman who has been unfitted  for the office forced upon her, by a life mentally dwarfed, morally  twisted and physically mutilated? Is it that the child is haled out of  nothingness to be inoculated, perhaps, with germs of disease in the  first instance and then half nourished for nine months in a body which  has been robbed of its vitality by the mutilation and torture to which  it has been subjected at the behest of fashion?    The highest duty of a parent is to so treat his child that it will enter  upon the struggle of life prepared to obtain the utmost happiness from  it.    If anyone fancies I have been too severe in my strictures I would ask  him to read what Mrs. Gilman has to say on the subject of home. It is  true that she does not come to the same conclusion that I do. She would  have women economically independent, and she would have children taken  care of by those especially fitted for the task, leaving mothers and  fathers free to go their separate ways. But how could there be separate  ways so long as the slavery of marriage remained? Woman must be not only  economically free, but altogether free. As I have said, motherhood is  not an affair of morals; it is a function. Marriage, on the other hand,  is a matter of morals; and hideously immoral it is, too. Then why not  have motherhood without its immoral, artificial adjunct, marriage?    You see I do not ask for easy divorce as a solution of the problem of  marriage. I set my face sternly against divorce. I am one with the  church in that. I only demand that there shall be no marriage at all,  that there shall be no fastening of life-long slavery on woman. Let  woman mother children or not, as she will. Let her say who shall be the  father of her child and of each child. Let motherhood be deemed not even  honorable, but only natural.    Can anyone believe that if men and women were free to decide whether or  not they would be parents, they would not in the end, seeing their duty  in the light of their knowledge, fit themselves for parenthood before  taking upon themselves its responsibilities?    I would like to say that I have no fear of the odium of the designation  of iconoclast. Nor do I quake lest some one triumphantly ask me what I  will put in the place of marriage and the home. As well might one demand  what I would give in the place of smallpox if I were able to eradicate  it. I am not concerned to find a substitute for such perversion of sex  activity. If men and women choose to live together in freedom, fathering  and mothering their children according to a rule grown out of freedom,  and directed by expediency, I fancy they would be, at least, as happy as  they can be now, tied together by a hard, unpleasant knot. And if an  economically free woman chose to have six children by six different  fathers, as a wise woman might well do, I believe she could be trusted  to secure those children from want quite as well as the mother-slave of  to-day, who bears her children at the will of an irresponsible man, and  then, often enough, has to take care of them and him too.    [Illustration]    \"Wealth protects and animates art and literature, as the dew enlivens  the fields.\"    Nonsense! Wealth animates art and literature, as the whistle of the  master animates the dog and makes him wag his tail.          THE MODERN NEWSPAPER.      Let me describe to you, very briefly, a newspaper day.    Figure first, then, a hastily erected, and still more hastily designed,  building in a dirty, paper-littered back street of London, and a number  of shabbily dressed men coming and going in this with projectile  swiftness. Within this factory companies of printers, tensely active  with nimble fingers--they were always speeding up the printers--ply  their typesetting machines, and cast and arrange masses of metal in a  sort of kitchen inferno, above which, in a beehive of little, brightly  lit rooms, disheveled men sit and scribble. There is a throbbing of  telephones and a clicking of telegraph instruments, a rushing of  messengers, a running to and fro of heated men, clutching proofs and  copy. Then begins a roar of machinery catching the infection, going  faster and faster, and whizzing and banging. Engineers, who have never  had time to wash since their birth, fly about with oil cans, while paper  runs off its rolls with a shudder of haste. The proprietor you must  suppose arriving explosively on a swift motor car, leaping out before  the thing is at a standstill, with letters and documents clutched in his  hand, rushing in, resolute to \"hustle,\" getting wonderfully in  everybody's way. At the sight of him even the messenger boys who are  waiting get up and scamper to and fro. Sprinkle your vision with  collisions, curses, incoherencies. You imagine all the parts of this  complex, lunatic machine working hysterically toward a crescendo of  haste and excitement as the night wears on. At last, the only things  that seem to travel slowly in those tearing, vibrating premises, are the  hands of the clock.    Slowly things draw on toward publication, the consummation of all those  stresses. Then, in the small hours, in the now dark and deserted streets  comes a wild whirl of carts and men, the place spurts paper at every  door; bales, heaps, torrents of papers, that are snatched and flung  about in what looks like a free fight, and off with a rush and clatter  east, west, north and south. The interest passes outwardly; the men from  the little rooms are going homeward, the printers disperse, yawning, the  roaring presses slacken. The paper exists. Distribution follows  manufacture, and we follow the bundles.    Our vision becomes a vision of dispersal. You see those bundles hurling  into stations, catching trains by a hair's breadth, speeding on their  way, breaking up, smaller bundles of them hurled with a fierce accuracy  out upon the platforms that rush by, and then everywhere a division of  these smaller bundles into still smaller bundles, into dispersing  parcels, into separate papers. The dawn happens unnoticed amidst a great  running and shouting of boys, a shoving through letter-slots, openings  of windows, spreading out upon book-stalls. For the space of a few  hours, you must figure the whole country dotted white with rustling  papers. Placards everywhere vociferate the hurried lie for the day. Men  and women in trains, men and women eating and reading, men by study  fenders, people sitting up in bed, mothers and sons and daughters  waiting for father to finish--a million scattered people are  reading--reading headlong--or feverishly ready to read. It is just as if  some vehement jet had sprayed that white foam of papers over the surface  of the land.    Nonsense! The whole affair is a noisy paroxysm of nonsense, unreasonable  excitement, witless mischief, and waste of strength--signifying nothing.                   --From H. G. Wells \"In the Days of the Comet.\"    [Illustration]          A VISIT TO SING SING.    By A MORALIST.      I was ennuye; the everlasting decency and respectability of my  surroundings bored me. On whichever side of me I looked, I saw people  doing the same things for the same reasons; or for the same lack of  reasons. And they were uninteresting.    \"Oh,\" said I to myself, \"these are the people of the ruts; they go that  way because others have gone; they are conforming. But there must be  some persons who do not conform. Where are they?\"    Now you can understand why it was that my thoughts turned toward that  monument of our civilization on the Hudson River, and why finally I  made up my mind to visit it.    I knew that neither my citizenship, nor yet my philosophic and human  interest in the working of that great school would avail to obtain me  entrance there, so I sought out one of the politicians of my district,  who at that time at least exercised his activities outside of the walls  of the building, and I exchanged with him a five-dollar bill for an  order to admit me.    \"I suppose,\" I said to the attendant who did the honors of the place for  me, \"that these persons who are garbed alike and who affect the same  tonsorial effect are those who have been unskillful in their  non-conformity.\"    \"They are prisoners,\" he replied. I bit my lip and looked as smug as I  remembered one should who as yet has the right of egress as well as  ingress in an institution of that character.    At that moment my eyes fell on a face that seemed familiar to me, and as  I studied it I saw with surprise that I had come upon a man who had once  been a schoolmate of mine.    Now I had always believed that if a person had done wrong, he would be  conscious of it; and that if he were found "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27190"],[0,"Pussy and Doggy Tales (#7)"],[1,"he consented to eat  some supper. They gave him a much better basket than mine, and we went  to bed.    Next morning, the Irish terrier got out of his basket, stretched  himself, yawned, and insisted on thrashing me before breakfast.    \"But I am a dog of peace,\" I said; \"I don't fight.\"    \"But I do, you see,\" he answered, \"that's just the difference.\"    I tried to defend myself, but he got hold of one of my feet, and held it  up. I sat up, and howled with pain and indignation.    \"Have you had enough?\" he said, and, without waiting for my answer,  proceeded to give me more.    \"But I don't fight,\" I said; \"I don't approve of fighting.\"    \"Then I'll teach you to have better manners than to say so,\" said he,  and he taught me for nearly five minutes.    \"Now then,\" he said, \"are you licked?\"    \"Yes,\" I answered; for indeed I was.    \"Are you sorry you ever tried to fight with me?\"    \"Yes,\" still seemed to be the only thing to say.    \"And do you approve of fighting?\"    He seemed to wish me to say \"yes,\" and so I said it.    \"Very well, then,\" he said; \"now we'll be friends, if you like. Come  along; you have given me an appetite for breakfast.\"    \"Any society worth cultivating about here?\" he asked, after the meal, in  his overbearing way.    \"I have a very great friend who lives next door,\" I said; \"but I don't  know whether I should care to introduce you to him.\"    He showed his teeth, and asked what I meant.    \"You see, you might not like him; and, if you didn't like him----but  he's a most agreeable dog.\"    \"A good fighter?\" asked Rustler.    I scratched my ear with my hind foot, and pretended to think.    \"Oh, I see he's not,\" said Rustler contemptuously; \"well, you shall  introduce him to me directly he comes back.\"    Rustler's overbearing and disagreeable manners so upset me that I was  quite thin when, at the end of the week, Roy came home. I told him my  troubles at once.    \"Bring your Rustler along,\" he said grandly, \"and introduce him to  _me_.\"    So I did. Rustler came along with his ears up, and his miserable tail  in the air. Roy lay by his kennel looking the image of serenity and  peacefulness. To judge by his expression, he might not have had a tooth  in his head.    Rustler stood with his feet as far apart as he could get them, and put  his head on one side.    \"I have heard so much about you, Mr. What's-your-name,\" he said, \"that I  have come to make a closer acquaintance.\"    \"Delighted, I'm sure,\" said Roy, who has splendid manners.    \"If you will get on your legs,\" said Rustler rudely, \"I will tell you  what I think of you.\"    Roy got on his legs, still looking very humble, and the next minute he  had Rustler by the front foot, and was making him sit down and scream  just as Rustler had made me. It was a magnificent fight.    \"Have you had enough?\" said Roy, and then gave him more without waiting  for an answer.    \"I don't want to fight any more,\" said Rustler at last; \"I am sorry I  spoke.\"    \"Then I'll teach you to have more pluck than to own it,\" said Roy.    When he had taught him for some time, he said, \"Are you licked?\"    \"Yes,\" said Rustler, glaring at me out his uninjured eye.    \"Are you sorry you tried to fight with me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Will you promise to leave my little friend here alone?\"    \"Yes.\"    Then Roy let him go. We shook tails all round, and Rustler and I went  home.    \"Poor Rustler,\" I said, \"I know exactly how you feel.\"    \"You little humbug,\" he said, with half a laugh--for he is not an  ill-natured fellow when you come to know him--\"you managed it very  cleverly, and I'm not one to bear malice; but, I say, your friend is  A1.\"    We are now the most united trio, and Roy and Rustler have licked all the  other dogs in the neighbourhood.          A Noble Dog      ROVER would go into the water fast enough for a bathe or a swim, but he  would not bring anything out. The children used to throw in sticks, and  Rover and I used to bound in together; but I would bring the stick back,  while he swam round and round, enjoying himself.    I am not vain, but I could not help feeling how much superior I was to  such a dog as Rover. He is a prize Newfoundland, and I am only a humble  retriever of obscure family.    So one day I said to him--    \"Why don't you fetch the sticks out when the children throw them in?\"    \"I don't care about sticks,\" he said.    \"But it's so grand and clever to be able to fetch them out.\"    \"Is it?\" he answered.    \"I know it is, for the children tell me so.\"    \"Do they?\" he said.    \"I wonder you are not ashamed,\" I went on, a little nettled by his  meekness, \"never to do anything useful. I should be, if I were you.\"    \"Ah,\" he said, \"but you see you are not. Good night.\"    We used to spend a great deal of time by the river. The children loved  to play there, and we dogs were always expected to go with them.    One day, as I was lying asleep on the warm grass by the river bank, I  heard a splash. I jumped in, but there was no stick, only one of the  children floating down on the stream, and screaming whenever her head  came from under the water.    I thought it was a new kind of game, not very interesting, so I swam out  again; and just as I was shaking the water out of my ears, I heard  another great flop, and there was Rover in the water, holding on to the  child's dress. He pulled her out some ten yards down the stream; and oh!  if you could have seen the fuss that the master and mistress and the  rest of the children made of that black and white spotted person!    \"Why, Rover,\" I said afterwards, when we had got home and were  talking it over, \"whatever made you think that the child wanted to be  pulled out of the water?\"    \"It's my business to pull people out of the water,\" he said.    \"But,\" I urged, \"I always thought you were too stupid to understand  things.\"    \"Did you?\" he said, turning his mild eyes on me.    \"Why didn't you explain to me that you----\"    \"My dear dog,\" he said, \"I never think it worth while to fetch sticks  out of the water, and I never think it worth while to explain things to  stupid people.\"          The Dyer's Dog      SHE was beautiful, with a strange unearthly beauty. She had a little  black nose. Her eyes were small, but bright and full of charm. Her ears  were long and soft, and her tail curled like one of the ostrich plumes  in the window of the dyer with whom she lived.    I have met many little dogs with noses as charming, and eyes as bright,  and tails as curly; but never one who, like my Bessie, was a rich, deep  pink all over.    I lived with a baker then. I was sitting on his doorstep when she first  delighted my eyes. I ran across the road to give her good morning. She  seemed pleased to see me. We had a little chat about the weather and the  other dogs in the street, and about buns, and rats, and the vices of the  domestic cat.    Her manners and her conversation were as bright and charming as her  eyes. Before we parted, we had made an appointment for the next  afternoon, and as I said good-bye, I ventured to ask--    \"How is it, lady, that you are of such a surpassingly beautiful colour?\"    \"It is natural to our family,\" she said, tossing her pretty ears. \"My  mother was the Royal Crimson Dog at the Court of the King of India.\"    I bowed with deep respect and withdrew, for I heard them calling me at  home.    The next day I looked for my beautiful pink-coloured lady, but I looked  in vain. Instead, a dog of a bright sky-blue, with a yellow ribbon round  its neck, sat in the sun on the dyer's doorstep. Yet, could I be  mistaken? That nose, those ears, that feathery tail, those bright and  beaming eyes!    I went across. She received me with some embarrassment, which  disappeared as I talked gaily of milk and guinea pigs, and the habits of  the cats'-meat man. Before we parted I said--    \"You have changed your dress.\"    \"Yes,\" she said, \"it's so common and vulgar to wear always one colour.\"    \"But I thought\"--I hesitated--\"that your mother was the Royal Crimson  Dog at the Court of----\"    \"So she was,\" replied the lady promptly, \"but my father was the  well-known sky-blue terrier at the Crystal Palace Dog Show. I resemble  both my parents.\"    I retired, fascinated by her high breeding and graceful explanations.  Through my dreams that night wandered a long procession of blue and  crimson dogs.    The next day, when I hurried to keep the appointment she had been good  enough to make with me, I found her a deep purple. Again I concealed my  surprise, while we talked of subjects of common interest, of dog-collars  and chains and kennels, of biscuits, bones, and the outrage of the  muzzling order; and at last I said--    \"You have changed your dress again. Your mother was the Royal----\"    \"Oh, don't,\" she said, \"it's so tiresome to keep repeating things. My  father was red and my mother was blue, and I myself, as you see, am  purple. Don't you know that crimson and blue make purple? Any child with  a shilling box of paints could have told you that.\"    I thanked her, and came away. Purple seemed to me the most beautiful  colour in the world.    But the next day she was green--as green as grass. After the customary  exchange of civilities, I remarked firmly--    \"Blue and crimson may make purple, but----\"    \"But green is my favourite colour,\" she said briskly. \"I suppose a dog  is not to be bound down by the prejudices of its parents?\"    I went away very sadly, and, as I went, I noticed that there were some  curtains in the dyer's window of exactly the same tint as my friend's  dress. The next day she was gone.    I sought her in vain. The day after, a French poodle appeared on the  dyer's doorstep, dressed in stripes of orange and scarlet. I went boldly  across to him.    \"Good morning, old man; how do you come to be that colour?\" I said.    \"They dye me so,\" he answered gloomily. \"It's a dreadful lot for a dog  that respects himself.\"    I never saw Bessie but once"]]]
