Scarcely had I lain down, however, when the voice  of the watch was heard shouting hastily, \"Lifeboat close alongside, sir!  Didn't see it till this moment.  She carries no lights.\"    Out I bounced, minus hat, coat, and shoes, and scrambled on deck just in  time to see a boat close under our stern, rendered spectrally visible by  the light of our lantern.  It was not the Ramsgate but the Broadstairs  lifeboat, the men of which had observed our first rocket, had launched  their boat at once, and had run down with the favouring gale.    \"What are you firing for?\" shouted the coxswain of the boat.    \"Ship on the sands bearing south,\" replied Jack, at the full pitch of  his stentorian voice.    The boat which was under sail, did not pause, and nothing more was said.  With a magnificent rush it passed us, and shot away into the darkness.  Our reply had been heard, and the lifeboat, steering by compass, went  straight as an arrow to the rescue.    It was a thrilling experience to me!  Spectral as a vision though it  seemed, and brief almost as the lightning flash, its visit was the  _real_ thing at last.  Many a time had I heard and read of our  lifeboats, and had seen them reposing in their boat-houses, as well as  out \"for exercise,\" but now I had _seen_ a lifeboat tearing before the  gale through the tormented sea, sternly bent on the real work of saving  human life.    Once again all became silent and unexciting on board the Gull, and I  went shivering below with exalted notions of the courage, endurance, and  businesslike vigour of our coast heroes.  I now lay wakeful and  expectant.  Presently the shout came again.    \"Tug's in sight, sir!\"    And once more I went on deck with the mate.    The steamer was quickly alongside, heaving wildly in the sea, with the  Ramsgate lifeboat \"Bradford\" in tow far astern.  She merely slowed a  little to admit of the same brief question and reply, the latter being  repeated, as the boat passed, for the benefit of the coxswain.  As she  swept by us I looked down and observed that the ten men who formed her  crew crouched flat on the thwarts.  Only the steersman sat up.  No  wonder.  It must be hard to sit up in a stiff gale with freezing spray,  and sometimes heavy seas sweeping over one.  I knew that the men were  wide awake and listening, but, as far as vision went that boat was  manned only by ten oilskin coats and sou'-westers!    A few seconds carried them out of sight, and thus, as regards the Gull  Lightship, the drama ended.  There was no possibility of the dwellers in  the floating lights hearing anything of the details of that night's work  until the fortnightly visit of their \"tender\" should fall due, but next  morning at low tide, far away in the distance, we could see the wreck,  bottom up, high on the Goodwin Sands.    Afterwards I learned that the ship's crew had escaped in one of their  own boats, and taken refuge in the South Sand Head Lightship, whence  they were conveyed next day to land, so that the gallant men of Ramsgate  and Broadstairs had all their toil and trouble for nothing!    Thus, you see, there are not only high lights and deep shadows, but also  neutral tints in the various incidents which go to make up the grand  picture of lifeboat work.    There is a Fund connected with the Broadstairs Lifeboat which deserves  passing notice here.  It was raised by the late Sir Charles Reed, in  1867, the proceeds to be distributed annually among the seamen who save  life on that coast.  The following particulars of this fund were  supplied by Sir Charles Reed himself:--    \"Eight boatmen of Broadstairs were interested in a lugger--the  Dreadnought--which had for years done good service on the Goodwins.  One  night they went off in a tremendous sea to save a French barque; but  though they secured the crew, a steam-tug claimed the prize and towed  her into Ramsgate Harbour.  The Broadstairs men instituted proceedings  to secure the salvage, but they were beaten in a London law court, where  they were overpowered by the advocacy of a powerful company.  In the  meantime they lost their lugger off the coast of Normandy, and in this  emergency the lawyers they had employed demanded their costs.  The poor  men had no means, and not being able to pay they were taken from their  homes and lodged in Maidstone Gaol.  He (Sir Charles) was then staying  in Broadstairs, and an appeal being made to him, he wrote to the  `Times', and in one week received nearly twice the amount required.  The  bill was paid, the men were liberated and brought home to their  families, and the balance of the amount, a considerable sum, was  invested, the interest to be applied to the rewarding of boatmen who, by  personal bravery, had distinguished themselves by saving life on the  coast.\"        CHAPTER FOUR.    CONSTRUCTION AND QUALITIES OF THE LIFEBOAT.    In previous chapters enough has been told, I think, to prove that our  lifeboats deserve earnest and thoughtful attention, not only as regards  their work, but in reference to their details of construction.  It has  been said that the lifeboat possesses special qualities which  distinguish it from all other boats.  Chief among these are the  self-righting and self-emptying principles.  Stability, resulting from  breadth of beam, etcetera, will do much to render a boat safe in rough  seas and tempestuous weather, but when a boat has to face mighty rollers  which turn it up until it stands straight on end, like a rearing horse,  and even tumble it right over, or when it has to plunge into horrible  maelstroms which seethe, leap, and fume in the mad contention of cross  seas, no device that man has yet fallen upon will save it from turning  keel up and throwing its contents into the water.    Instead therefore, of attempting to build a boat which cannot upset, men  have deemed it wiser to attempt the construction of one which will not  remain in that position, but which will, of necessity, right itself.  The end aimed at has been achieved, and the boat now in use by the  Lifeboat Institution is absolutely perfect in this respect.  What more  could be desired in any boat than that, after being upset, it should  right itself in a _few seconds_, and empty itself of water in less than  one minute?    A boat which does not right itself when overturned is only a lifeboat so  long as it maintains its proper position on the water.    Let its self-emptying and buoyant qualities be ever so good, you have  only to upset it to render it no better than any other boat;--indeed, in  a sense, it is worse than other boats, because it leads men to face  danger which they would not dare to encounter in an ordinary boat.    Doubtless, lifeboats on the non-self-righting principle possess great  stability, and are seldom overturned; nevertheless they occasionally  are, and with fatal results.  Here is one example.  In the month of  January, 1865, the Liverpool lifeboat, when out on service, was upset,  and seven men of her crew were drowned.  This was not a self-righting  boat, and it did not belong to the Lifeboat Institution, most of whose  boats are now built on the self-righting principle.  Moreover, the  unfortunate men had not put on lifebelts.  It may be added that the men  who work the boats of the Institution are not allowed to go off without  their cork lifebelts on.    Take another case.  On the 4th January, 1857, the Point of Ayr lifeboat,  when under sail in a gale, upset at a distance from the land.  The  accident was seen from the shore, but no aid could be rendered, and the  whole boat's crew--thirteen in number--were drowned.  This boat was  considered a good lifeboat, and doubtless it was so in many respects,  but it was not a self-righting one.  Two or three of the poor fellows  were seen clinging to the keel for twenty minutes, by which time they  became exhausted, were washed off, and, having no lifebelts on,  perished.    Again in February, 1858, the Southwold lifeboat--a large sailing boat,  esteemed one of the finest in the kingdom, but not on the self-righting  principle--went out for exercise, and was running before a heavy surf  with all sail set, when she suddenly ran on the top of a sea, turned  broadside to the waves, and was upset.  The crew in this case were  fortunately near the shore, had on their lifebelts, and, although some  of them could not swim, were all saved--no thanks, however, to their  boat, which remained keel up--but three unfortunate gentlemen who had  been permitted to go off in the boat without lifebelts, and one of whom  was a good swimmer, lost their lives.    Let it be noted here that the above three instances of disaster occurred  in the day time, and the contrast of the following case will appear all  the stronger.    One very dark and stormy night in October, 1858, the small lifeboat of  Dungeness put off through a heavy sea to a wreck three-quarters of a  mile from the shore.  Eight stout men of the coastguard composed her  crew.  She was a self-righting, self-emptying boat, belonging to the  Lifeboat Institution.  The wreck was reached soon after midnight, and  found to have been abandoned.  The boat, therefore, returned towards the  shore.  Now, there is a greater danger in rowing before a gale than in  rowing against it.  For the first half mile all went well, though the  sea was heavy and broken, but, on crossing a deep channel between two  shoals, the little lifeboat was caught up and struck by three heavy seas  in succession.  The coxswain lost command of the rudder, and she was  carried away before a sea, broached to, and upset, throwing her crew out  of her.  _Immediately_ she righted herself, cleared herself of water,  and was brought up by her anchor which had fallen out when she was  overturned.  The crew meanwhile having on lifebelts, floated and swam to  the boat, caught hold of the life-lines festooned round her sides,  clambered into her, cut the cable, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#7)"],[1,"not see, and we therefore directed our course up the banks of the  rivulet towards the foot of it, intending to climb to the top, should  that be possible--as, indeed, we had no doubt it was.    Jack, being the wisest and boldest among us, took the lead, carrying the  axe on his shoulder.  Peterkin, with his enormous club, came second, as  he said he should like to be in a position to defend me if any danger  should threaten.  I brought up the rear; but having been more taken up  with the wonderful and curious things I saw at starting than with  thoughts of possible danger, I had very foolishly left my club behind  me.  Although, as I have said, the trees and bushes were very luxuriant,  they were not so thickly crowded together as to hinder our progress  among them.  We were able to wind in and out, and to follow the banks of  the stream quite easily, although, it is true, the height and thickness  of the foliage prevented us from seeing far ahead.  But sometimes a  jutting-out rock on the hillsides afforded us a position whence we could  enjoy the romantic view and mark our progress towards the foot of the  hill.  I was particularly struck, during the walk, with the richness of  the undergrowth in most places, and recognised many berries and plants  that resembled those of my native land, especially a tall, elegantly  formed fern, which emitted an agreeable perfume.  There were several  kinds of flowers, too; but I did not see so many of these as I should  have expected in such a climate.  We also saw a great variety of small  birds of bright plumage, and many paroquets similar to the one, that  awoke Peterkin so rudely in the morning.    Thus we advanced to the foot of the hill without encountering anything  to alarm us, except, indeed, once, when we were passing close under a  part of the hill which was hidden from our view by the broad leaves of  the banana-trees, which grew in great luxuriance in that part.  Jack was  just preparing to force his way through this thicket when we were  startled and arrested by a strange pattering or rumbling sound, which  appeared to us quite different from any of the sounds we had heard  during the previous part of our walk.    \"Hallo!\" cried Peterkin, stopping short, and grasping his club with both  hands; \"what's that?\"    Neither of us replied; but Jack seized his axe in his right hand, while  with the other he pushed aside the broad leaves and endeavoured to peer  amongst them.    \"I can see nothing,\" he said after a short pause.  \"I think it--\"    Again the rumbling sound came, louder than before, and we all sprang  back and stood on the defensive.  For myself, having forgotten my club,  and not having taken the precaution to cut another, I buttoned my  jacket, doubled my fists, and threw myself into a boxing attitude.  I  must say, however, that I felt somewhat uneasy; and my companions  afterwards confessed that their thoughts at this moment had been  instantly filled with all they had ever heard or read of wild beasts and  savages, torturings at the stake, roastings alive, and such-like  horrible things.  Suddenly the pattering noise increased with tenfold  violence.  It was followed by a fearful crash among the bushes, which  was rapidly repeated, as if some gigantic animal were bounding towards  us.  In another moment an enormous rock came crashing through the  shrubbery, followed by a cloud of dust and small stones, and flew close  past the spot where we stood, carrying bushes and young trees along with  it.    \"Pooh! is that all?\" exclaimed Peterkin, wiping the perspiration off his  forehead.  \"Why, I thought it was all the wild men and beasts in the  South Sea Islands, galloping on in one grand charge to sweep us off the  face of the earth, instead of a mere stone tumbling down the  mountain-side!\"    \"Nevertheless,\" remarked Jack, \"if that same stone had hit any of us it  would have rendered the charge you speak of quite unnecessary,  Peterkin.\"    This was true, and I felt very thankful for our escape.  On examining  the spot more narrowly, we found that it lay close to the foot of a very  rugged precipice, from which stones of various sizes were always  tumbling at intervals.  Indeed, the numerous fragments lying scattered  all round might have suggested the cause of the sound had we not been  too suddenly alarmed to think of anything.    We now resumed our journey, resolving that, in our future excursions  into the interior, we would be careful to avoid this dangerous  precipice.    Soon afterwards we arrived at the foot of the hill, and prepared to  ascend it.  Here Jack made a discovery which caused us all very great  joy.  This was a tree of a remarkably beautiful appearance, which Jack  confidently declared to be the celebrated bread-fruit tree.    \"Is it celebrated?\" inquired Peterkin with a look of great simplicity.    \"It is,\" replied Jack.    \"That's odd, now,\" rejoined Peterkin; \"I never heard of it before.\"    \"Then it's not so celebrated as I thought it was,\" returned Jack,  quietly squeezing Peterkin's hat over his eyes; \"but listen, you  ignorant boobie! and hear of it now.\"    Peterkin readjusted his hat, and was soon listening with as much  interest as myself while Jack told us that this tree is one of the most  valuable in the islands of the south; that it bears two, sometimes  three, crops of fruit in the year; that the fruit is very like wheaten  bread in appearance, and that it constitutes the principal food of many  of the islanders.    \"So,\" said Peterkin, \"we seem to have everything ready prepared to our  hands in this wonderful island--lemonade ready bottled in nuts, and  loaf-bread growing on the trees!\"    Peterkin, as usual, was jesting; nevertheless, it is a curious fact that  he spoke almost the literal truth.    \"Moreover,\" continued Jack, \"the bread-fruit tree affords a capital gum,  which serves the natives for pitching their canoes; the bark of the  young branches is made by them into cloth; and of the wood, which is  durable and of a good colour, they build their houses.  So you see,  lads, that we have no lack of material here to make us comfortable, if  we are only clever enough to use it.\"    \"But are you sure that that's it?\" asked Peterkin.    \"Quite sure,\" replied Jack; \"for I was particularly interested in the  account I once read of it, and I remember the description well.  I am  sorry, however that I have forgotten the descriptions of many other  trees which I am sure we have seen to-day, if we could but recognise  them.  So you see, Peterkin, I'm not up to everything yet.\"    \"Never mind, Jack,\" said Peterkin with a grave, patronising expression  of countenance, patting his tall companion on the shoulder--\"never mind,  Jack; you know a good deal for your age.  You're a clever boy, sir--a  promising young man; and if you only go on as you have begun, sir, you  will--\"    The end of this speech was suddenly cut short by Jack tripping up  Peterkin's heels and tumbling him into a mass of thick shrubs, where,  finding himself comfortable, he lay still, basking in the sunshine,  while Jack and I examined the bread-fruit tree.    We were much struck with the deep, rich green colour of its broad  leaves, which were twelve or eighteen inches long, deeply indented, and  of a glossy smoothness, like the laurel.  The fruit, with which it was  loaded, was nearly round, and appeared to be about six inches in  diameter, with a rough rind, marked with lozenge-shaped divisions.  It  was of various colours, from light pea-green to brown and rich yellow.  Jack said that the yellow was the ripe fruit.  We afterwards found that  most of the fruit-trees on the island were evergreens, and that we  might, when we wished, pluck the blossom and the ripe fruit from the  same tree.  Such a wonderful difference from the trees of our own  country surprised us not a little.  The bark of the tree was rough and  light-coloured; the trunk was about two feet in diameter, and it  appeared to be twenty feet high, being quite destitute of branches up to  that height, where it branched off into a beautiful and umbrageous head.  We noticed that the fruit hung in clusters of twos and threes on the  branches; but as we were anxious to get to the top of the hill, we  refrained from attempting to pluck any at that time.    Our hearts were now very much cheered by our good fortune, and it was  with light and active steps that we clambered up the steep sides of the  hill.  On reaching the summit a new, and if possible a grander, prospect  met our gaze.  We found that this was not the highest part of the  island, but that another hill lay beyond, with a wide valley between it  and the one on which we stood.  This valley, like the first, was also  full of rich trees--some dark and some light green, some heavy and thick  in foliage, and others light, feathery, and graceful, while the  beautiful blossoms on many of them threw a sort of rainbow tint over  all, and gave to the valley the appearance of a garden of flowers.  Among these we recognised many of the bread-fruit trees, laden with  yellow fruit, and also a great many cocoa-nut palms.  After gazing our  fill we pushed down the hillside, crossed the valley, and soon began to  ascend the second mountain.  It was clothed with trees nearly to the  top; but the summit was bare, and in some places broken.    While on our way up we came to an object which filled us with much  interest.  This was the stump of a tree that had evidently been cut down  with an axe!  So, then, we were not the first who had viewed this  beautiful isle.  The hand of man had been at work there before us.  It  now began to recur to us again that perhaps the island was inhabited,  although we had not seen any traces of man until now.  But a second  glance at the stump convinced us that we had not more reason to think so  now than formerly; for the surface of the wood was quite decayed and  partly covered with fungus and green matter,"]]]
