If we plan to make life fine, if we say, in effect, \"I will be good and  cheerful, no matter what happens,\" we are beginning at the wrong end. We  may be able to work back from our mottoes to real living, but the  chances are we shall stop somewhere by the way, too confused and  uncertain to go on. Self-control, at its best, is not a conscious thing.  It is not well that we should try to be good, but that we should so  dignify our lives with the spirit of good that evil becomes well-nigh  impossible to us.          VIII    THE LIGHTER TOUCH          Heart not so heavy as mine,      Wending late home,      As it passed my window      Whistled itself a tune.                  EMILY DICKINSON.    I have never seen good come from frightening worriers. It is no doubt  wise to speak the truth, but it seems to me a mistake to say in public  print or in private advice that worry leads to tragedies of the worst  sort. No matter how hopeful we may be in our later teaching about the  possibilities of overcoming worry, the really serious worrier will  pounce upon the original tragic statement and apply it with terrible  insistence to his own case.    I would not minimize the seriousness of worry, but I am convinced that  we can rarely overcome it by direct voluntary effort. It does not go  until we forget it, and we do not forget it if we are always trying  consciously to overcome it. We worriers must go about our  business--other business than that of worry.    Life is serious--alas, too serious--and full enough of pathos. We cannot  joke about its troubles; they are real. But, at least, we need not  magnify them. Why should we act as though everything depended upon our  efforts, even the changing seasons and the blowing winds? No doubt we  are responsible for our own acts and thoughts and for the welfare of  those who depend upon us. The trouble is we take unnecessary  responsibilities so seriously that we overreach ourselves and defeat our  own good ends.    I would make my little world more blessedly careless--with an _abandon_  that loves life too much to spoil it with worry. I would cherish so  great a desire for my child's good that I could not scold and bear down  upon him for every little fault, making him a worrier too, but,  instead, I would guide him along the right path with pleasant words and  brave encouragement. The condemnation of faults is rarely constructive.    We had better say to the worriers, \"Here is life; no matter what  unfortunate things you may have said or done, you must put all evil  behind you and live--simply, bravely, well.\" The greater the evil,  the greater the need of forgetting. Not flippantly, but reverently,  leave your misdeeds in a limbo where they may not rise to haunt you.  This great thing you may do, not with the idea of evading or escaping  consequences, but so that past evil may be turned into present and  future good. The criminal himself is coming to be treated this way. He  is no longer eternally reminded of his crime. He is taken out into the  sunshine and air and is given a shovel to dig with. A wonderful thing is  that shovel. With it he may bury the past and raise up a happier,  better future. We must care so much to expiate our sins that we are  willing to neglect them and live righteously. That is true repentance,  constructive repentance.    We cannot suddenly change our mental outlook and become happy when grief  has borne us down. \"For the broken heart silence and shade,\"--that is  fair and right. I would say to those who are unhappy, \"Do not try to be  happy, you cannot force it; but let peace come to you out of the great  world of beauty that calmly surrounds our human suffering, and that  speaks to us quietly of God.\" Genuine laughter is not forced, but we may  let it come back into our lives if we know that it is right for it to  come.    We have all about us instances of the effectiveness of the lighter touch  as applied to serious matters. The life of the busy surgeon is a good  example. He may be, and usually is, brimming with sympathy, but if he  were to feel too deeply for all his patients, he would soon fail and  die. He goes about his work. He puts through a half-dozen operations in  a way that would send cold shivers down the back of the uninitiated. And  yet he is accurate and sure as a machine. If he were to take each case  upon his mind in a heavy, consequential way, if he were to give deep  concern to each ligature he ties, and if he were to be constantly afraid  of causing pain, he would be a poor surgeon. His work, instead of being  clean and sharp, would suffer from over-conscientiousness. He might  never finish an operation for fear his patient would bleed to death.  Such a man may be the reverse of flippant, and yet he may actually enjoy  his somber work. Cruel, bloodthirsty? Not at all. These men--the great  surgeons--are as tender as children. But they love their work, they  really care very deeply for their patients. The successful ones have the  lighter touch and they have no time for worry.    Sometimes we wish to arouse the public conscience. Do the long columns  of figures, the impressive statistics, wake men to activity? It is  rather the keen, bright thrust of the satirist that saves the day. Once  in a New England town meeting there was a movement for a much-needed new  schoolhouse. By the installation of skylights in the attic the old  building had been made to accommodate the overflow of pupils. The  serious speakers in favor of the new building had left the audience  cold, when a young man arose and said he had been up into the attic and  had seen the wonderful skylights that were supposed to meet the needs of  the children. \"I have seen them,\" he said; \"we used to call them  scuttles when I was a boy.\" A hundred thousand dollars was voted for the  new schoolhouse.    There is a natural gayety in most of us which helps more than we realize  to keep us sound. The pity is that when responsibilities come and  hardships come, we repress our lighter selves sternly, as though such  repression were a duty. Better let us guard the springs of happiness  very, very jealously. The whistling boy in the dark street does more  than cheer himself on the way. He actually protects himself from evil,  and brings courage not only to himself, but to those who hear him. I do  not hold for false cheerfulness that is sometimes affected, but a brave  show of courage in a forlorn hope will sometimes win the day. It is  infinitely more likely to win than a too serious realization of the  danger of defeat. The show of courage is often not a pretense at all,  but victory itself.    The need of the world is very great and its human destiny is in our  hands. Half of those who could help to right the wrongs are asleep or  too selfishly immersed in their own affairs. We need more helpers like  my friend of the skylights. Most of us are far too serious. The  slumberers will slumber on, and the worriers will worry, the serious  people will go ponderously about until some one shows them how  ridiculous they are and how pitiful.          IX    REGRETS AND FOREBODINGS          Regret avails little--still less remorse--the one keeps alive      the old offense, the other creates new offenses.                  GOETHE.    The unrepentant sinner walks abroad. Unfortunately for us moralists he  seems to be having a very good time. We must not condone him, though he  may be a very lovable person; neither must we altogether condemn him,  for he may be repentant in the very best way of all ways, the way that  forgets much and leaves behind more, because life is so fine that it  must not be spoiled, and because progress is in every way better than  retrospection. The fact is, that repentance is too often the fear of  punishment, and such fear is, to say the least, unmanly. I would rather  be a lovable sinner than one of the people who repent because they  cannot bear to think of the consequences. Knowledge and fear of  consequences undoubtedly keep a great many young people from the  so-called sins of ignorance. But there must be something behind  knowledge and fear of consequences to stop the youth of spirit from  doing what he is inclined to do. Over and over again we must go back to  the appreciation of life's dignity and beauty--to the consciousness of  the spirit of God behind and in the world if we are to find a balance  and a character that will \"deliver us from evil.\"    When we have found this consciousness--when we live it and breathe it,  we shall be far less apt to sin, and when we have sinned, as we all must  in the course of our blundering lives, we shall not waste our time in  regret or in the fear of consequences. If the God we dream of is as  great as the sea, or as beautiful as a tree, we need not fear Him. He  will be tender, and just at the same time. He will be as forgiving as  He is strong. The best we can do, then, is to leave our sins in the hand  of God and go our way, sadder and wiser, maybe, but not regretting too  much, not fearing any more.    There is a new idea in medicine--the development of which has been one  of the most striking achievements of modern times--the idea of  psychanalysis as taught and advocated by Freud in Germany. The plan  is to study the subconscious mind of the nervous patient by means of  hypnotism, to assist the patient to recall all the mental experiences of  his past,--even his very early childhood,--and in this way to make clear  the origin of the misconceptions and the unfortunate impressions which  have presumably exerted their influence through the years. The new  system includes, also, the interpretation of dreams, their effect upon  the conscious life and their influence upon the mentality. Very  wonderful results are reported from the pursuit of this method. Many a  badly warped and twisted life has been straightened out and renewed when  the searchlight has revealed the hidden influences that have been at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22114"],[0,"A Plain Cookery Book for the Working Classes (#7)"],[1,"downward in the pot in which it is to be  boiled. It will take about two hours to boil a good sized pudding of  this kind; when you take it out of the pot, be very careful not to run  the fork through the crust, and pay great attention how you handle the  pudding while removing the cloth, so as not to spill or waste the gravy  it contains, as that would go very far towards spoiling the pudding you  have had all the trouble to prepare.      No. 81. HASHED MEATS.    I strongly recommend that you never allow yourselves to be persuaded,  that cold meat dinners are cheap dinners; just the reverse of this  assumption is the fact. And, let me tell you, that those who make the  former assertion, do so only because they know no better, and as an  excuse for their idleness. I am well aware that in your homes it is not  a common every-day occurrence for you to dress a large joint of meat,  from which enough would be left for one or more days' dinner; but still  it may, and does sometimes occur, that you have cold meat at your  disposal, upon which you may exercise your knowledge in domestic  economy. Besides, some of you who are living close to noblemen and  gentlemen's mansions in the country, or otherwise, may perhaps stand a  chance of now and then receiving a donation of this kind. And whenever  you have any cold meat, I advise you to cook it up into stews of the  various kinds described in this work, or else make it into a hash as  follows: First, chop two onions fine, and put them to boil with pepper  and salt and a pint of water, in a saucepan for ten minutes, then throw  in the meat cut in thin slices, mixed with a little flour; boil all  together gently for ten minutes longer, and pour the hash into a dish  containing either some ready boiled potatoes, or else some slices of  toasted bread.      No. 82. BOILED TRIPE.    Tripe is not exactly a cheap commodity for food; yet, as you may feel  occasionally inclined to indulge in a treat of this kind, I will give  you instructions to cook it in the most economical manner. When you have  procured any given quantity of tripe, cut it up in pieces the size of  two inches square, put these into a saucepan containing skim milk, or  milk and water, enough to swim the tripe; add some peeled onions,  pepper, and salt, and a sprig of thyme, and boil gently for at least an  hour; and when the tripe is done, eat it with mustard and some well  boiled potatoes.      No. 83. BAKED TRIPE.    Cut the tripe up in pieces, and put it into an earthen pot, with some  ale, cider, or water, enough to cover it in; add sliced onions, pepper,  and salt, and a good pinch of allspice; put the lid on the pot, and set  the tripe in the oven to bake for two hours.      No. 84. SAUSAGE DUMPLINGS.    Make one pound of flour and two ounces of dripping, or chopped suet,  into a firm paste, by adding just enough water to enable you to knead  the whole together. Divide this paste into twelve equal parts, roll each  of these out sufficiently large to be able to fold up one of the beef  sausages in it, wet the edge of the paste to fasten the sausage securely  in it, and, as you finish off each sausage dumpling, drop it gently into  a large enough saucepan, containing plenty of _boiling_ water, and when  the whole are finished, allow them to boil gently by the side of the  fire for one hour, and then take up the dumplings with a spoon free from  water, on to a dish, and eat them while they are hot.      No. 85. SAUSAGE ROLLS.    Procure a quartern of dough from the baker's, knead this with four  ounces of butter, dripping, or chopped suet; divide it into twelve equal  parts, and use each piece of paste to enfold a beef sausage in it; place  these rolls on a baking-tin, and bake them in the oven for about twenty  minutes or half an hour.      No. 86. ROAST PORK.    Let us suppose, or rather hope, that you may sometimes have a leg of  pork to cook for your dinner; it will eat all the better if it is scored  all over by cutting the rind, or rather slitting it crosswise, at short  distances, with the point of a sharp knife; it is to be well sprinkled  all over with salt, and allowed to absorb the seasoning during some  hours previously to its being cooked. Prepare some stuffing as  follows:--Chop six onions and twelve sage leaves fine, fry these with a  bit of butter, pepper, and salt, for five minutes; then add six ounces  of bread soaked in water; stir all together on the fire for five  minutes, and use this stuffing to fill up a hole or pocket, which you  will make by running the point of a knife down between the rind and the  flesh of the joint of pork; secure this by sewing it up, or else fasten  it securely in with a small wooden skewer or twig. The joint of pork, so  far prepared, must then be placed upon a trivet in a baking-dish  containing plenty of peeled potatoes, and, if possible, a few apples for  the children; add half a pint of water, pepper and salt, and if the  joint happens to be a leg, it will require about two hours to bake it.      No. 87. BUBBLE AND SQUEAK.    When you happen to have some cold boiled salt beef, cut this up in  slices; fry it on both sides, and dish it up round some cabbages or any  dressed vegetables ready to hand, which must be chopped up, seasoned  with pepper and salt, and fried.      No. 88. JUGGED HARE.    It does sometimes happen that when you are living in the country, in the  neighbourhood of considerate gentlefolks who possess game preserves,  that they now and then make presents of a hare and a few rabbits to the  poor cottagers in their vicinity. And when you are so fortunate as to  have a hare given to you, this is the way to cook it:--First, cut the  hare up into pieces of equal size, then cut up a pound of bacon into  small squares, and fry these in a saucepan for five minutes; next, add  the pieces of hare, and, stirring them round in the pot with a spoon,  fry them brown; add a good handful of flour, some pepper and allspice,  carrots and onions, and a sprig of winter savory; moisten the stew with  nearly three pints of water, and stir it all together on the fire till  it boils, and then set it on the hob to continue gently simmering for  about an hour and a-half or two hours; the jugged hare will then be  ready for dinner.      No. 89. BOILED BACON AND CABBAGES.    Put a piece of bacon in a pot capable of containing two gallons; let it  boil up, and skim it well; then put in some well-washed split cabbages,  a few carrots and parsnips also split, and a few peppercorns; when the  whole has boiled gently for about an hour and a-half, throw in a dozen  peeled potatoes, and by the time that these are done, the dinner will be  ready. And this is the way in which to make the most of this excellent  and economical dinner. First, take up the bacon, and having placed it on  its dish, garnish it round with the cabbages, carrots, parsnips, and  potatoes, and then add some pieces of crust, or thin slices of bread, to  the liquor in which the bacon-dinner has been cooked, and this will  furnish you with a good wholesome soup with which to satisfy the first  peremptory call of your healthy appetites.      No. 90. ECONOMICAL VEGETABLE POTTAGE.    In France, and also in many parts of Europe, the poorer classes but very  seldom taste meat in any form; the chief part of their scanty food  consists of bread, vegetables, and more especially of their soup, which  is mostly, if not entirely, made of vegetables, or, as is customary on  the southern coasts of France, Italy, and Spain, more generally of  fish, for making which kinds of soup see Nos. 4, 6, 118, etc.    The most common as well as the easiest method for making a good mess of  cheap and nutritious soup is the following:--If you are five or six in  family, put a three-gallon pot on the fire rather more than half full of  water, add four ounces of butter, pepper and salt, and small sprigs of  winter savory, thyme, and parsley; and when this has boiled, throw in  any portion or quantity, as may best suit your convenience, of such of  the following vegetables as your garden can afford:--Any kind of  cabbages cleaned and split, carrots, turnips, parsnips, broad beans,  French beans, peas, broccoli, red cabbages, vegetable marrow, young  potatoes, a few lettuce, some chervil, and a few sprigs of mint. Allow  all this to simmer by the side of the hob for about two hours, and then,  after taking up the more considerable portion of the whole vegetables on  to a dish, eat one half, or as much as you may require, of the soup with  bread in it, and make up your dinner with the whole vegetables and more  bread. The remainder will serve for the next day. Let me persuade you,  my friends, to try and persevere in adopting this very desirable kind of  food, when in your power, for your ordinary fare. I, of course, intend  this remark more particularly for the consideration of such of my  readers as are or may be located in the country, and who may have a  little garden of their own.      No. 91. HOW TO MAKE A FISH CURRY.    Slice up six onions fine, and fry them with a little butter or grease  over a slow fire until they become very lightly coloured; then add three  or four green apples in slices, and when these are dissolved, place your  pieces of any kind of fish, which you have previously fried in a  frying-pan, on the top of the onions, etc., sprinkle a spoonful of curry  powder all over the fish, put the lid on the saucepan, and set the  whole on the hob of a moderate fire, or in the oven, if you have one, to  remain simmering for about half an hour; the curry will then be ready to  be eaten with well-boiled rice.      No. 92. THIS IS THE WAY TO BOIL RICE.    I recommend you to buy Patna rice, as it is the cheapest; it is best to  soak it in water over-night, as it then requires less time to boil it,  and moreover, when soaked, the rice becomes lighter, from the fact that  the grains separate more readily while boiling.
