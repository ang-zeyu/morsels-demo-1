They are so _very_ \"moral\" that they have no working  contact with the average affairs of every-day life. These moral  principles need to be brought down to the ground through their statement  in social and in psychological terms. We need to see that moral  principles are not arbitrary, that they are not \"transcendental\"; that  the term \"moral\" does not designate a special region or portion of life.  We need to translate the moral into the conditions and forces of our  community life, and into the impulses and habits of the individual.    All the rest is mint, anise, and cummin. The one thing needful is that  we recognize that moral principles are real in the same sense in which  other forces are real; that they are inherent in community life, and in  the working structure of the individual. If we can secure a genuine  faith in this fact, we shall have secured the condition which alone is  necessary to get from our educational system all the effectiveness there  is in it. The teacher who operates in this faith will find every  subject, every method of instruction, every incident of school life  pregnant with moral possibility.          OUTLINE        I.

As he drew near Normanstand he looked forward eagerly to seeing Stephen,  and the sight of the old church lying far below him as he came down the  steep road over Alt Hill, which was the short-cut from Norcester, set his  mind working.  His visit to the tomb of his own father made him think of  the day when he kept Stephen from entering the crypt.    The keenest thought is not always conscious.  It was without definite  intention that when he came to the bridle-path Harold turned his horse's  head and rode down to the churchyard.  As he pushed open the door of the  church he half expected to see Stephen; and there was a vague possibility  that Leonard Everard might be with her.    The church was cool and dim.  Coming from the hot glare the August  sunshine it seemed, at the first glance, dark.  He looked around, and a  sense of relief came over him.  The place was empty.    But even as he stood, there came a sound which made his heart grow cold.  A cry, muffled, far away and full of anguish; a sobbing cry, which  suddenly ceased.    It was the voice of Stephen.  He instinctively knew where it came from;  the crypt.  Only for the experience he had had of her desire to enter the  place, he would never have suspected that it was so close to him.  He ran  towards the corner where commenced the steps leading downward.  As he  reached the spot a figure came rushing up the steps.  A boy in Eton  jacket and wide collar, careless, pale, and agitated.  It was Leonard  Everard.  Harold seized him as he came.    'Where is Stephen?' he cried in a quick, low voice.    'In the vault below there.  She dropped her light and then took mine, and  she dropped it too.  Let me go!  Let me go!'  He struggled to get away;  but Harold held him tight.    'Where are the matches?'    'In my pocket.  Let me go!  Let me go!'    'Give me them--this instant!'  He was examining the frightened boy's  waistcoat pockets as he spoke.  When he had got the matches he let the  boy go, and ran down the steps and through the open door into the crypt,  calling out as he came:    'Stephen!  Stephen dear, where are you?  It is I--Harold!'  There was no  response; his heart seemed to grow cold and his knees to weaken.  The  match spluttered and flashed, and in the momentary glare he saw across  the vault, which was not a large place, a white mass on the ground.  He  had to go carefully, lest the match should be blown out by the wind of  his passage; but on coming close he saw that it was Stephen lying  senseless in front of a great coffin which rested on a built-out pile of  masonry.  Then the match went out.  In the flare of the next one he lit  he saw a piece of candle lying on top of the coffin.  He seized and lit  it.  He was able to think coolly despite his agitation, and knew that  light was the first necessity.  The bruised wick was slow to catch; he  had to light another match, his last one, before it flamed.  The couple  of seconds that the light went down till the grease melted and the flame  leaped again seemed of considerable length.  When the lit candle was  placed steadily on top of the coffin, and a light, dim, though strong  enough to see with, spread around, he stooped and lifted Stephen in his  arms.  She was quite senseless, and so limp that a great fear came upon  him that she might be dead.  He did not waste time, but carried her  across the vault where the door to the church steps stood out sharp  against the darkness, and bore her up into the church.  Holding her in  one arm, with the other hand he dragged some long cushions from one of  the pews and spread them on the floor; on these he laid her.  His heart  was smitten with love and pity as he looked.  She was so helpless; so  pitifully helpless!  Her arms and legs were doubled up as though broken,  disjointed; the white frock was smeared with patches of thick dust.  Instinctively he stooped and pulled the frock down and straightened out  the arms and feet.  He knelt beside her, and felt if her heart was still  beating, a great fear over him, a sick apprehension.  A gush of thankful  prayer came from his heart.  Thank God! she was alive; he could feel her  heart beat, though faintly underneath his hand.  He started to his feet  and ran towards the door, seizing his hat, which lay on a seat.  He  wanted it to bring back some water.  As he passed out of the door he saw  Leonard a little distance off, but took no notice of him.  He ran to the  stream, filled his hat with water, and brought it back.  When he came  into the church he saw Stephen, already partially restored, sitting up on  the cushions with Leonard supporting her.    He was rejoiced; but somehow disappointed.  He would rather Leonard had  not been there.  He remembered--he could not forget--the white face of  the boy who fled out of the crypt leaving Stephen in a faint within, and  who had lingered outside the church door whilst he ran for water.  Harold  came forward quickly and raised Stephen, intending to bring her into the  fresh air.  He had a shrewd idea that the sight of the sky and God's  greenery would be the best medicine for her after her fright.  He lifted  her in his strong arms as he used to do when she was a very little child  and had got tired in their walks together; and carried her to the door.  She lent herself unconsciously to the movement, holding fast with her arm  round his neck as she used to do.  In her clinging was the expression of  her trust in him.  The little sigh with which she laid her head on his  shoulder was the tribute to his masculine power, and her belief in it.  Every instant her senses were coming back to her more and more.  The veil  of oblivion was passing from her half-closed eyes, as the tide of full  remembrance swept in upon her.  Her inner nature was expressed in the  sequence of her emotions.  Her first feeling was one of her own fault.  The sight of Harold and his proximity recalled to her vividly how he had  refused to go into the crypt, and how she had intentionally deceived him,  negatively, as to her intention of doing that of which he disapproved.  Her second feeling was one of justice; and was perhaps partially evoked  by the sight of Leonard, who followed close as Harold brought her to the  door.  She did not wish to speak of herself or Harold before him; but she  did not hesitate to speak of him to Harold:    'You must not blame Leonard.  It was all my fault.  I made him come!'  Her  generosity appealed to Harold.  He was angry with the boy for being there  at all; but more for his desertion of the girl in her trouble.    'I'm not blaming him for being with you!' he said simply.  Leonard spoke  at once.  He had been waiting to defend himself, for that was what first  concerned that young gentleman; next to his pleasure, his safety most  appealed to him.    'I went to get help.  You had let the candle drop; and how could I see in  the dark?  You would insist on looking at the plate on the coffin!'    A low moan broke from Stephen, a long, low, trembling moan which went to  Harold's heart.  Her head drooped over again on his shoulder; and she  clung close to him as the memory of her shock came back to her.  Harold  spoke to Leonard over his shoulder in a low, fierce whisper, which  Stephen did not seem to hear:    'There! that will do.  Go away!  You have done enough already.  Go!  Go!'  he added more sternly, as the boy seemed disposed to argue.  Leonard ran  a few steps, then walked to the lich-gate, where he waited.    Stephen clung close to Harold in a state of agitation which was almost  hysterical.  She buried her face in his shoulder, sobbing brokenly:    'Oh, Harold!  It was too awful.  I never thought, never for a moment,  that my poor dear mother was buried in the crypt.  And when I went to  look at the name on the coffin that was nearest to where I was, I knocked  away the dust, and then I saw her name: \"Margaret Norman, aetat 22.\"  I  couldn't bear it.  She was only a girl herself, only just twice my  age--lying there in that terrible dark place with all the thick dust and  the spiders' webs.  Oh, Harold, Harold!  How shall I ever bear to think  of her lying there, and that I shall never see her dear face?  Never!  Never!'    He tried to soothe her by patting and holding her hands.  For a good  while the resolution of the girl faltered, and she was but as a little  child.  Then her habitual strength of mind asserted itself.  She did not  ask Harold how she came to be out in the church instead of in the crypt  when she recovered her senses.  She seemed to take it for granted that  Leonard had carried her out; and when she said how brave it had been of  him, Harold, with his customary generosity, allowed her to preserve the  belief.  When they had made their way to the gate Leonard came up to  them; but before he could speak Stephen had begun to thank him.  He  allowed her to do so, though the sight of Harold's mouth set in scorn,  and his commanding eyes firmly fixed on him, made him grow hot and cold  alternately.  He withdrew without speaking; and took his way home with a  heart full of bitterness and revengeful feelings.    In the park Stephen tried to dust herself, and then Harold tried to  assist her.  But her white dress was incurably soiled, the fine dust of  the vault seemed to have got ingrained in the muslin.  When she got to  the house she stole upstairs, so that no one might notice her till she  had made herself tidy.    The next day but one she took Harold for a walk in the afternoon.  When  they were quite alone and out of earshot she said:    'I have been thinking all night about poor mother.  Of course I know she  cannot be moved from the crypt.  She must remain there.  But there  needn't be all that dust.  I want you to come there with me some time  soon.  I fear I am afraid to go alone.  I want to bring some flowers and  to tidy up the place.  Won't you come with me this time?  I know now,  Harold, why you didn't let me go"]]]
