PALMARES: THE NEGRO NUMANTIA      One of the most glorious achievements in the history of the Iberian  Peninsula was the long and desperate defence of Numantia against the  Roman legionaries sent to effect the destruction of the city. When the  beleaguered inhabitants could no longer maintain themselves, owing to  the shortage of food supplies, they burned the city, and those who  were not killed in battle with the Romans committed suicide. Scipio  AEmilianus, the Roman leader, entered Numantia to find nothing but  burning embers and piles of corpses.    This incident has an almost exact parallel in the history of  Brazil--only this time the heroes were Negroes, defending the capital  of one of the earliest and one of the strangest Negro republics in the  history of the world. The Portuguese, who were the first to introduce  Negro slavery into Europe, did not long delay in carrying the  institution to their colony of Brazil. It was in 1574 that the first  slave ship reached there. Thereafter, great numbers of Negroes were  brought, especially to northern Brazil, in the equatorial belt, to  work in the profitable sugar fields. No region of the Americas was so  accessible to the slave trade, for the Brazilian coast juts out into  the Atlantic Ocean directly opposite the Gulf of Guinea in Africa,  whence most of the slaves were procured. It is profitless here to go  into the question of the treatment of the slaves by their Portuguese  masters. Some were badly treated, and took the chance of flight to the  interior forest lands, rather than submit any longer. Various causes  prompted yet others to escape from the colonial plantations. Thus many  a _quilombo_, or Negro village of the forest, was formed. By far the  most famous of these was the _quilombo_ of Palmares, whose history is  the subject of this article.    In 1650, forty determined Negroes of the province of Pernambuco, all  of them natives of Guinea, rose against their masters, taking as much  as they could in the way of arms and provisions, and fled to the  neighboring forest. There they founded a _quilombo_ on the site of a  well-known Negro village of earlier days, which the Dutch had  destroyed. The tale of their escape was told throughout the province,  with the result that it was not long before the population of the new  _quilombo_ was greatly increased. Slaves and freemen were eager to  join their brethren in the forest. It seemed prudent, however, to go  farther away from the white settlements, lest the very strength of the  Negro town should invite annihilation or re-enslavement by the  planters. Thus it was that the inland site of Palmares, not far from  present-day Anadia, was chosen. A town was founded, and all seemed  well except for one thing--an essential to permanence was lacking, for  there were no women. A detachment of Negroes was sent on the romantic  mission of procuring wives for the colony. This party marched to the  nearest plantations, and, without stopping to discriminate, took all  the women it could find, black, mulatto, and white. Palmares was now  on a secure footing indeed.    At first, the inhabitants lived by a species of banditry, robbing the  whites whenever they could. Gradually, a more settled type of life  developed. The Negroes began to engage in agriculture, and at length  entered into something approximating peaceful relations with the  Portuguese settlements. Trade took the place of warfare, although fear  of the overgrown _quilombo_ was perhaps as much the motive on the part  of the whites as the desire for profits. A rustic republic of an  admirable type was formed for the maintenance of internal order and  external safety. Combining republican and monarchical features, they  elected a chief, or king, called the _Zombe_, who ruled with absolute  authority during the term of his life. The right of candidacy was  restricted to a group recognized as composing the bravest men of the  community. Any man in the state might aspire to this dignity, provided  he had Negro blood in his veins. There were other officials, both of a  military and of a civil character. In the interests of good order,  the _Zombes_ made laws imposing the death penalty for murder,  adultery, and robbery. Slavery existed, and in this respect there was  a curious custom. Every Negro who had won his freedom from the white  man, by whatever method, as for example by a successful flight to  Palmares, remained a free man. Those who were captured while in a  state of slavery, however, became slaves in Palmares. Thus the reward  of freedom was offered to those who should escape from the planters,  and a punishment was held out to those who would not, or could not, do  so. In course of time, the Negro republic expanded until it included a  number of towns. Palmares alone is said to have had a population of  20,000, and the number of fighting men in the whole republic was some  10,000. The capital city, Palmares, was surrounded by wooden walls,  made of the trunks of large trees. The city was entered by means of  three huge gates, on the tops of which were great platforms, always  well guarded.    For nearly half a century the little republic prospered. It was  perhaps only natural that the Portuguese settlers should wish to  destroy it, for it represented an alien force and an ever present  danger, certainly so far as their profits from the use of slave labor  went. At any rate, in the year 1696, Governor Caetano de Mello of  Pernambuco decided upon an expedition against Palmares. A strong force  was sent, but it was met by the Negroes and totally defeated. A  veritable army of some 7,000 men was now gathered, and placed under  the command of a competent soldier named Bernardo Vieira. This time,  the Portuguese troops were well provided with artillery, with which  the Negro republic could not be expected to cope. Palmares was  reached, but it was in no mood for surrender, and it was necessary to  begin a regular siege of the city. The defence was desperate. After  the Portuguese artillery had breached the walls in three places, their  infantry attacked in force. They entered the city, but had to take it,  foot by foot. At last, the defenders came to the center of Palmares,  where a high cliff impeded further retreat. Death or surrender were  now the only alternatives. Seeing that his cause was lost beyond  repair, the _Zombe_ hurled himself over the cliff, and his action was  followed by the most distinguished of his fighting men. Some prisoners  were indeed taken, but it is perhaps a tribute to Palmares, though a  gruesome one, that they were all put to death; it was not safe to  enslave these men, despite the value of their labor. Thus passed  Palmares, the Negro Numantia, most famous and greatest of the  Brazilian _qui-lombos_.                                         CHARLES E. CHAPMAN      ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF HISTORY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.          SLAVERY IN CALIFORNIA      Slavery in California prior to the Mexican War was slavery in the  Spanish possessions. The Spaniards began with the enslavement of  Indians and later at the advice of De las Casas changed to that of  Negroes.[16] This system was first used in the West Indies and later  extended to other colonies. It is said that about the year 1537,  Cortes fitted out at the port of Tehuantepec, several small vessels,  provided with everything required for planting a colony and sailed  north to the head of the Gulf of California, transporting four hundred  Spaniards and three hundred Negro slaves, that he had assembled for  that purpose.[17] This is the first mention of Negro slavery in  California. After the founding of the Mission of San Carlos by the  president, Father Junipero Serra, with a community of twenty-three  friars, we read that the first interment in the cemetery was that of  Ignacio Ramirez, a former mulatto slave from San Antonio, who had  money to purchase his freedom.[18] There were too a number of Negro  slaves brought to California between these periods. They came on  trading ships and with various expeditions, which they usually  deserted after reaching the State. Hittell is wrong, therefore, in  saying that the first slave in California was brought there in 1825  when the wife of Antonio Jose de Cot, a Spaniard, brought with her a  slave girl named Juana, fourteen years of age, from Lima to San  Francisco. He doubted even that this was the first slave in California  for the lady expressed her intention to avail herself of the first  opportunity to leave.[19]    Spain did not especially bother about Negro slavery in her Pacific  coast territory for nearly two hundred years before the coming of the  Americans. She promised by the treaty of September 30, 1817, to  abolish the slave trade October 31, 1820, in all Spanish territory. In  1821, however, certain of the northern colonies of Spain in America  established their independence as the United "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20907"],[0,"The Best of the World's Classics,  Restricted to prose.

He  closed the temples and forbade the Egyptians to offer sacrifice,  compelling them instead to labor, one and all, in his service. Some  were required to drag blocks of stone down to the Nile from the  quarries in the Arabian range of hills; others received the blocks  after they had been conveyed in boats across the river, and drew them  to the range of hills called the Libyan. A hundred thousand men  labored constantly, and were relieved every three months by a fresh  lot. It took ten years' oppression of the people to make the causeway  for the conveyance of the stones, a work not much inferior, in my  judgment, to the pyramid itself. This causeway is five furlongs in  length, ten fathoms wide, and in height, at the highest part, eight  fathoms. It is built of polished stone, and is covered with carvings  of animals. To make it took ten years, as I said--or rather to make  the causeway, the works on the mound where the pyramid stands, and the  underground chambers, which Cheops intended as vaults for his own use;  these last were built on a sort of island, surrounded by water  introduced from the Nile by a canal. The pyramid itself was twenty  years in building. It is a square, eight hundred feet each way, and  the height the game, built entirely of polished stone, fitted together  with the utmost care. The stones of which it is composed are none of  them less than thirty feet in length.    The pyramid was built in steps, battlement-wise, as it is called, or,  according to others, altar-wise. After laying the stones for the base,  they raised the remaining stones to their places by means of machines  formed of short wooden planks. The first machine raised them from the  ground to the top of the first step. On this there was another  machine, which received the stone upon its arrival, and conveyed it to  the second step, whence a third machine advanced it still higher.  Either they had as many machines as there were steps in the pyramid or  possibly they had but a single machine, which, being easily moved,  was transferred from tier to tier as the stone rose--both accounts are  given, and therefore I mention both. The upper portion of the pyramid  was finished first, then the middle, and finally the part which was  lowest and nearest the ground. There is an inscription in Egyptian  characters on the pyramid which records the quantity of radishes,  onions, and garlic consumed by the laborers who constructed it; and I  perfectly well remember that the interpreter who read the writing to  me said that the money expended in this way was 1,600 talents of  silver. If this then is a true record, what a vast sum must have been  spent on the iron tools used in the work, and on the feeding and  clothing of the laborers, considering the length of time the work  lasted, which has already been stated, and the additional time--no  small space, I imagine--which must have been occupied by the quarrying  of the stones, their conveyance, and the formation of the underground  apartments!

Cheops,  according to Herodotus, reigned fifty years.]          IV    THE STORY OF PERIANDER'S SON[15]      After Periander had put to death his wife Melissa, it chanced that on  his first affliction a second followed of a different kind. His wife  had borne him two sons, and one of them had now reached the age of  seventeen, the other of eighteen years, when their mother's father,  Procles, tyrant of Epidaurus,[16] asked them to his court. They went,  and Procles treated them with much kindness, as was natural,  considering they were his own daughter's children. At length, when the  time for parting came, Procles as he was sending them on their way  said, \"Know you now, my children, who it was that caused your mother's  death?\" The elder son took no account of this speech, but the younger,  whose name was Lycophron, was sorely troubled at it--so much so that  when he got back to Corinth, looking upon his father as his mother's  murderer, he would neither speak to him nor answer when spoken to nor  utter a word in reply to all his father's questionings. So Periander,  at last growing furious at such behavior, banished his son from his  house.    The younger son gone, he turned to the elder and asked him what it was  that their grandfather had said to them. Then the son related in how  kind and friendly a fashion the grandfather had received them; but,  not having taken any notice of the speech which Procles had uttered at  parting, he quite forgot to mention it. Periander insisted that it was  not possible this should be all--their grandfather must have given  them some hint or other--and he went on pressing his son till at last  he remembered the parting speech and told it. Periander, after he had  turned the whole matter over in his thoughts and felt unwilling to  give way at all, sent a messenger to the persons who had opened their  houses to his outcast son and forbade them to harbor him. Then the  boy, when he had been driven from one friend, sought refuge with  another, but was forced from shelter to shelter by the threats of his  father, who menaced all those that took him in, and commanded them to  shut their doors against him. Still, as fast as he was forced to leave  one house he went to another, and was received by the inmates; for his  acquaintances, altho in no small alarm, yet gave him shelter, as he  was Periander's son.    At last Periander made proclamation that whoever harbored his son, or  even spoke to him, should forfeit a certain sum of money to Apollo. On  hearing this no one any longer liked to take him in, or even to hold  converse with him, and he himself did not think it right to seek to do  what was forbidden; so, abiding by his resolve, he made his lodging in  the public porticoes. When four days had passed in this way,  Periander, seeing how wretched his son was, that he neither washed nor  took any food, felt moved with compassion toward him; wherefore,  foregoing his anger, he approached the lad, and said, \"Which is  better, oh, my son, to fare as now thou farest or to receive my crown  and all the good things that I possess, on the one condition of  submitting thyself to thy father? See, now, tho my own child, and lord  of this wealthy Corinth, thou hast brought thyself to a beggar's life,  because thou must resist and treat with anger him whom it least  behooves thee to oppose. If there has been a calamity, and thou  bearest me ill will on that account, bethink thee that I too feel it,  and am the greater sufferer, inasmuch as it was by me that the deed  was done. For thyself, now that thou knowest how much better a thing  it is to be envied than pitied, and how dangerous it is to indulge  anger against parents and superiors, come back with me to thy home.\"  With such words as these did Periander chide his son; but the latter  made no reply except to remind his father that he was indebted to the  god in the penalty for coming and holding converse with him. Then  Periander knew there was no cure for the youth's malady, nor means of  overcoming it; so he prepared a ship and sent him away out of his  sight to Corcyra,[17] which island at that time belonged to him. As  for Procles, Periander, regarding him as the true author of all his  present troubles, went to war with him as soon as his son was gone,  and not only made himself master of his kingdom, Epidaurus, but also  took Procles himself, and carried him into captivity.    As time went on, and Periander came to be old, he found himself no  longer equal to the oversight and management of affairs. Seeing  therefore in his elder son no manner of ability, but knowing him to be  dull and blockish, he sent to Corcyra and recalled Lycophron to take  the kingdom. Lycophron, however, did not even deign to ask the bearer  of this message a question. But Periander's heart was set upon the  youth, so he sent again to him, this time by his own daughter, the  sister of Lycophron, who would, he thought, have more power to  persuade him than any other person. Then the daughter, when she had  reached Corcyra, spoke thus with her brother: \"Dost thou wish the  kingdom, brother, to pass into strange hands, and our father's wealth  to be made a prey rather than thyself return to enjoy it? Come back  home with me, and cease to punish thyself. It is scant gain, this  obstinacy. Why seek to cure evil by evil? Mercy, remember, is by many  set above justice. Many, also while pushing their mother's claims have  forfeited their father's fortune. Power is a slippery thing--it has  many suitors; and he is old and stricken in years--let not thy own  inheritance go to another.\"    Thus did the sister, who had been tutored by Periander what to say,  urge all the arguments most likely to have weight with her brother.  He, however, made answer that so long as he knew his father to be  still alive, he would never go back to Corinth. When the sister "]]]
