A tomb of coral, the dirge of bee,        The grey apes' guttural groan      For Alliolyle, for Lallerie,        For thee, O Muziomone!              THE SLEEPING BEAUTY          The scent of bramble sweets the air,        Amid her folded sheets she lies,      The gold of evening in her hair,        The blue of morn shut in her eyes.        How many a changing moon hath lit        The unchanging roses of her face!      Her mirror ever broods on it        In silver stillness of the days.        Oft flits the moth on filmy wings        Into his solitary lair;      Shrill evensong the cricket sings        From some still shadow in her hair.        In heat, in snow, in wind, in flood,        She sleeps in lovely loneliness,      Half folded like an April bud        On winter-haunted trees.              THE HORN          Hark! is that a horn I hear,        In cloudland winding sweet--      And bell-like clash of bridle-rein,        And silver-shod light feet?        Is it the elfin laughter of        Fairies riding faint and high,      'Neath the branches of the moon,        Straying through the starry sky?        Is it in the globed dew        Such sweet melodies may fall?      Wood and valley--all are still,        Hushed the shepherd's call.        Hark! is that a horn I hear        In cloudland winding sweet?      Or gloomy goblins marching out        Their captain Puck to greet?              CAPTAIN LEAN          Out of the East a hurricane        Swept down on Captain Lean--      That mariner and gentleman        Will ne'er again be seen.        He sailed his ship against the foes        Of his own country dear,      But now in the trough of the billows        An aimless course doth steer.        Powder was violets to his nostril,        Sweet the din of the fighting-line,      Now he is flotsam on the seas,        And his bones are bleached with brine.        The stars move up along the sky,        The moon she shines so bright,      And in that solitude the foam        Sparkles unearthly white.        This is the tomb of Captain Lean,        Would a straiter please his soul?      I trow he sleeps in peace,        Howsoever the billows roll!              THE PORTRAIT OF A WARRIOR          His brow is seamed with line and scar;        His cheek is red and dark as wine;      The fires as of a Northern star        Beneath his cap of sable shine.        His right hand, bared of leathern glove,        Hangs open like an iron gin,      You stoop to see his pulses move,        To hear the blood sweep out and in.        He looks some king, so solitary        In earnest thought he seems to stand,      As if across a lonely sea        He gazed impatient of the land.        Out of the noisy centuries        The foolish and the fearful fade;      Yet burn unquenched these warrior eyes,        Time hath not dimmed nor death dismayed.              HAUNTED          From out the wood I watched them shine,--        The windows of the haunted house,      Now ruddy as enchanted wine,        Now dim as flittermouse.        There went a thin voice piping airs        Along the grey and crooked walks,--      A garden of thistledown and tares,        Bright leaves, and giant stalks.        The twilight rain shone at its gates,        Where long-leaved grass in shadow grew;      And black in silence to her mates        A voiceless raven flew.        Lichen and moss the lone stones greened,        Green paths led lightly to its door,      Keen from her lair the spider leaned,        And dusk to darkness wore.        Amidst the sedge a whisper ran,        The West shut down a heavy eye,      And like last tapers, few and wan,        The watch-stars kindled in the sky.              THE RAVEN'S TOMB          'Build me my tomb,' the Raven said,      'Within the dark yew-tree,      So in the Autumn yewberries      Sad lamps may burn for me.      Summon the haunted beetle,      From twilight bud and bloom,      To drone a gloomy dirge for me      At dusk above my tomb.      Beseech ye too the glowworm      To bear her cloudy flame,      Where the small, flickering bats resort,      Whistling in tears my name.      Let the round dew a whisper make,      Welling on twig and thorn;      And only the grey cock at night      Call through his silver horn.      And you, dear sisters, don your black      For ever and a day,      To show how sweet a raven      In his tomb is laid away.'              THE CHRISTENING          The bells chime clear,      Soon will the sun behind the hills sink down;      Come, little Ann, your baby brother dear      Lies in his christening-gown.        His godparents      Are all across the fields stepped on before,      And wait beneath the crumbling monuments,      This side the old church door.        Your mammie dear      Leans frail and lovely on your daddie's arm;      Watching her chick, 'twixt happiness and fear,      Lest he should come to harm.        All to be blest      Full soon in the clear heavenly water, he      Sleeps on unwitting of't, his little breast      Heaving so tenderly.        I carried you,      My little Ann, long since on this same quest,      And from the painted windows a pale hue      Lit golden on your breast;        And then you woke,      Chill as the holy water trickled down,      And, weeping, cast the window a strange look,      Half smile, half infant frown.        I scarce could hear      The larks a-singing in the green meadows,      'Twas summertide, and budding far and near      The hedges thick with rose.        And now you're grown      A little girl, and this same helpless mite      Is come like such another bud half-blown,      Out of the wintry night.        Time flies, time flies!      And yet, bless me! 'tis little changed am I;      May Jesu keep from tears those infant eyes,      Be love their lullaby!              THE MOTHER BIRD          Through the green twilight of a hedge      I peered, with cheek on the cool leaves pressed,      And spied a bird upon a nest:      Two eyes she had beseeching me      Meekly and brave, and her brown breast      Throbb'd hot and quick above her heart;      And then she oped her dagger bill,--      'Twas not a chirp, as sparrows pipe      At break of day; 'twas not a trill,      As falters through the quiet even;      But one sharp solitary note,      One desperate, fierce, and vivid cry      Of valiant tears, and hopeless joy,      One passionate note of victory:      Off, like a fool afraid, I sneaked,      Smiling the smile the fool smiles best,      At the mother bird in the secret hedge      Patient upon her lonely nest.              THE CHILD IN THE STORY GOES TO BED          I prythee, Nurse, come smooth my hair,        And prythee, Nurse, unloose my shoe,      And trimly turn my silken sheet        Upon my quilt of gentle blue.        My pillow sweet of lavender        Smooth with an amiable hand,      And may the dark pass peacefully by        As in the hour-glass droops the sand.        Prepare my cornered manchet sweet,        And in my little crystal cup      Pour out the blithe and flowering mead        That forthwith I may sup.        Withdraw my curtains from the night,        And let the crisped crescent shine      Upon my eyelids while I sleep,        And soothe me with her beams benign.        From far-away there streams the singing        Of the mellifluent nightingale,--      Surely if goblins hear her lay,        They shall not o'er my peace prevail.        Now quench my silver lamp, prythee,        And bid the harpers harp that tune      Fairies which haunt the meadowlands        Sing clearly to the stars of June.        And bid them play, though I in dreams        No longer heed their pining strains,      For I would not to silence wake        When slumber o'er my senses wanes.        You Angels bright who me defend,        Enshadow me with curved wing,      And keep me in the darksome night        Till dawn another day do bring.              THE CHILD IN THE STORY AWAKES          The light of dawn rose on my dreams,        And from afar I seemed to hear      In sleep the mellow blackbird call        Hollow and sweet and clear.        I prythee, Nurse, my casement open,        Wildly the garden peals with singing,      And hooting through the dewy pines        The goblins all are winging.        O listen the droning of the bees,        That in the roses take delight!      And see a cloud stays in the blue        Like an angel still and bright.        The gentle sky is spread like silk,        And, Nurse, the moon doth languish there,      As if it were a perfect jewel        In the morning's soft-spun hair.        The greyness of the distant hills        Is silvered in the lucid East,      See, now the sheeny-plumed cock        Wags haughtily his crest.        'O come you out, O come you out,        Lily, and lavender, and lime;      The kingcup swings his golden bell,        And plumpy cherries drum the time.        'O come you out, O come you out!        Roses, and dew, and mignonette,      The sun is in the steep blue sky,        Sweetly the morning star is set.'              THE LAMPLIGHTER          When the light of day declineth,      And a swift angel through the sky      Kindleth God's tapers clear,      With ashen staff the lamplighter      Passeth along the darkling streets      To light our earthly lamps;        Lest, prowling in the darkness,      The thief should haunt with quiet tread,      Or men on evil errands set;      Or wayfarers be benighted;      Or neighbours bent from house to house      Should need a guiding torch.        He is like a needlewoman      Who deftly on a sable hem      Stitches in gleaming jewels;      Or, haply, he is like a hero,      Whose bright deeds on the long journey      Are beacons on our way."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23580"],[0,"The Children's Bible (#7)"],[1,"was fond of game; but Rebekah loved Jacob.    Once when Jacob was preparing a stew, Esau came in from the fields, and  he was very hungry; so he said to Jacob, \"Let me swallow some of that  red stew, for I am very hungry.\" But Jacob said, \"Sell me first of all  your right as the eldest.\" Esau replied, \"See, I am nearly dead now! So  of what use is this birthright to me?\" Jacob said, \"First solemnly  promise to give it to me.\" So Esau solemnly promised and sold his  birthright to Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and stewed lentils, and  when he had had something to eat and drink, he got up and went away. In  this way Esau gave away his birthright.    When Isaac was so old and so nearly blind that he could not see, he  called Esau his oldest son and said to him, \"My son.\" Esau answered,  \"Here am I.\" Then Isaac said, \"See, I am old and do not know how soon I  may die. Now, therefore, take your quiver and your bow and go out into  the fields and hunt game for me and prepare for me savory food, such as  I love, and bring it to me that I may eat and that I may bless you  before I die.\"    Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau  went into the fields to hunt game, Rebekah said to her son Jacob, \"I  just now heard your father say to your brother Esau, 'Bring me game and  prepare for me savory food that I may eat it and bless you before I  die.' Now, my son, do as I tell you: Go to the flock and bring me from  there two good kids, and I will make of them savory food for your  father, such as he loves. Then take it to him, that he may eat, so that  he may bless you before he dies.\" But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother,  \"You know that my brother Esau is a hairy man, while I am smooth.  Perhaps my father will feel of me; then I shall appear to him as a  deceiver, and I shall bring blame upon me and not a blessing.\" But his  mother said to him, \"Upon me be the blame, my son; only obey me and go,  bring the kids to me.\" So he went and brought them to his mother, and  his mother made savory food such as his father loved.    Rebekah also took the fine clothes of her older son Esau, which she had  with her in the tent, and put them on her younger son Jacob. Then she  put the skins of the kids upon his hands and upon the smooth part of his  neck, and she placed the savory food and the bread which she had  prepared in his hand, and he went to his father and said, \"My father.\"  Isaac answered, \"Here am I; who are you, my son?\" Jacob said, \"I am Esau  your oldest son. I have done as you commanded me. Sit up and eat of my  game, that you may bless me.\" Isaac said to his son, \"How very quickly  you have found it, my son.\" He answered, \"Yes, because Jehovah your God  gave me success.\"    Then Isaac said to Jacob, \"Come here, my son, that I may feel of you to  find out whether you are really my son Esau or not.\" So Jacob went near  to Isaac his father, and he felt of him and said, \"The voice is the  voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau. Are you really my  son Esau?\" Jacob answered, \"I am.\" And Isaac did not recognize him, for  his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's. So he blessed him. Then  Isaac said, \"Bring the food to me, that I may eat of my son's game and  bless you.\" So he brought it to him, and he ate. Jacob also brought him  wine, and he drank.    Then his father Isaac said to him, \"Come near now and kiss me, my son.\"  As he came near and kissed him, he smelled the smell of his garment, and  blessed him.    As soon as Isaac had given Jacob his blessing, and Jacob was about to  leave his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting. He also had  made savory food and was bringing it to his father. So he said to him,  \"Father, rise and eat of your son's game, that you may bless me.\" But  Isaac his father said to him, \"Who are you?\" He answered, \"I am your  son, your oldest, Esau.\" Then Isaac trembled and said, \"Who then is he  that has hunted game and brought it to me, so that I ate plentifully  before you came, and blessed him? Also blessed shall he be!\"    When Esau heard the words of his father, he uttered a loud and bitter  cry and said to his father, \"Bless me, even me also, O my father.\"    But Isaac said, \"Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your  blessing.\" Esau said, \"Is it not because he was named Jacob, which means  Supplanter, that he has supplanted me these two times: he took my  birthright, and now he has taken my blessing!\" Then he said, \"Have you  kept a blessing for me?\" Isaac answered Esau, \"See, I have made him your  master and I have given to him all his relatives as servants and grain  and wine as his food. What then can I do for you, my son?\" Esau said to  his father, \"Is that the only blessing you have, my father?\" and Esau  began to weep aloud. Then Isaac his father answered him:            \"You shall live far from earth's fertile places,           And away from the dew of heaven.           By your sword you shall live,           And your brother you shall serve.\"      JACOB'S DREAM    Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing which his father had given him.  And Esau said to himself, \"My father will soon die; then I will kill  Jacob, my brother.\"    When the words of her older son Esau were told to Rebekah, she sent for  her younger son Jacob and said to him, \"Your brother, Esau, is going to  kill you. Now therefore, my son, listen to me: run away to my brother  Laban at Haran and stay with him for a time until your brother is no  longer angry and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send  and bring you back. Why should I lose both of you in one day?\"    Then Jacob set out from Beersheba and went toward Haran. And when he  arrived at a certain place, he passed the night there, because the sun  had set. And he took one of the stones from its place and put it under  his head and lay down to sleep. Then he dreamed and saw a ladder set up  on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and the angels of God were  going up and down on it.    Jehovah also stood beside him and said, \"I am Jehovah, the God of  Abraham and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to  you and to your children. See, I am with you, and will keep you wherever  you go and will bring you again to this land; for I will not leave you  until I have done what I have promised you.\"    When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said, \"Surely Jehovah is in this  place, and I did not know it.\" And he was filled with awe and said,  \"This place is the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\"    So Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had put  under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil upon the top of  it. And he named that place Bethel, which means House of God. Jacob also  made this promise, \"If God will be with me and protect me on this  journey which I am making and give me bread to eat and clothing to put  on, and if I return safe and sound to my father's house, then Jehovah  shall be my God, and this stone which I have set up as a pillar shall be  a house of God. And of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give a  tenth to thee.\"      THE DECEIVER DECEIVED    Then Jacob went on his journey and arrived at the land of the children  of the East. And he looked and saw a well in the field, and there were  three flocks of sheep lying down by it; for from that well they watered  the flocks; but there was a large stone over the well. When all the  flocks were gathered there, they used to roll away the stone and water  the sheep and then put the stone back in its place over the well.    Jacob said to the men, \"My friends, from where do you come?\" They said,  \"We are from Haran.\" Then he said to them, \"Do you know Laban the son of  Nahor?\" And they said, \"We know him.\" And he said to them, \"Is all well  with him?\" And they said, \"All is well; indeed, this is Rachel his  daughter coming with the sheep.\" And he said, \"See, the sun is still  high! It is not time for the cattle to be gathered together. Water the  sheep and feed them.\" But they said, \"We cannot until all the flocks are  gathered together, and they roll away the stone from the well; then we  will water the sheep.\"    While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's  sheep; for she was a shepherdess. When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of  Laban, his mother's brother, and Laban's sheep, he went up and rolled  the stone from the well and watered the flock of Laban his mother's  brother. Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. And when Jacob told  Rachel that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rebekah's  son, she ran and told her father.    As soon as Laban heard about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet  him, put his arms around him, kissed him many times, and brought him to  his home. When Jacob told Laban all about these things, Laban said to  him, \"Surely you are my bone and my flesh.\" So he remained with him a  whole month.    Then Laban said to Jacob, \"Should you serve me for nothing simply  because you are related to me? Tell me what shall be your wages?\" Now  Laban had two daughters: the name of the older was Leah, and the name of  the younger was Rachel. Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful.  Jacob loved Rachel, and so he said, \"I will serve you seven years for  Rachel your younger daughter.\" And Laban said, \"It is better for me to  give her to you than to give her to any other man. Stay with me.\" So  Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few  days, because he loved her so.    Then Jacob said to Laban, \"Give me my wife, for my time is up, and let  me marry her.\" So Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a  feast. In the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him,  and Jacob received her as his wife.    When in the morning Jacob found it was Leah, he said to Laban, \"What is  this you have done to me? Did I not serve you for Rachel? Why then have  you "]]]
