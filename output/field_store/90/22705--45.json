In  psychology, the scientific attitude is even more recent and more  difficult than in the physical sciences: it is natural to consider  that human nature is either good or bad, and to suppose that the  difference between good and bad, so all-important in practice, must be  important in theory also. It is only during the last century that an  ethically neutral psychology has grown up; and here too, ethical  neutrality has been essential to scientific success.    In philosophy, hitherto, ethical neutrality has been seldom sought and  hardly ever achieved. Men have remembered their wishes, and have  judged philosophies in relation to their wishes. Driven from the  particular sciences, the belief that the notions of good and evil must  afford a key to the understanding of the world has sought a refuge in  philosophy. But even from this last refuge, if philosophy is not to  remain a set of pleasing dreams, this belief must be driven forth. It  is a commonplace that happiness is not best achieved by those who  seek it directly; and it would seem that the same is true of the good.  In thought, at any rate, those who forget good and evil and seek only  to know the facts are more likely to achieve good than those who view  the world through the distorting medium of their own desires.    We are thus brought back to our seeming paradox, that a philosophy  which does not seek to impose upon the world its own conceptions of  good and evil is not only more likely to achieve truth, but is also  the outcome of a higher ethical standpoint than one which, like  evolutionism and most traditional systems, is perpetually appraising  the universe and seeking to find in it an embodiment of present  ideals. In religion, and in every deeply serious view of the world and  of human destiny, there is an element of submission, a realisation of  the limits of human power, which is somewhat lacking in the modern  world, with its quick material successes and its insolent belief in  the boundless possibilities of progress. \"He that loveth his life  shall lose it\"; and there is danger lest, through a too confident love  of life, life itself should lose much of what gives it its highest  worth. The submission which religion inculcates in action is  essentially the same in spirit as that which science teaches in  thought; and the ethical neutrality by which its victories have been  achieved is the outcome of that submission.    The good which it concerns us to remember is the good which it lies in  our power to create--the good in our own lives and in our attitude  towards the world. Insistence on belief in an external realisation of  the good is a form of self-assertion, which, while it cannot secure  the external good which it desires, can seriously impair the inward  good which lies within our power, and destroy that reverence towards  fact which constitutes both what is valuable in humility and what is  fruitful in the scientific temper.    Human beings cannot, of course, wholly transcend human nature;  something subjective, if only the interest that determines the  direction of our attention, must remain in all our thought. But  scientific philosophy comes nearer to objectivity than any other human  pursuit, and gives us, therefore, the closest constant and the most  intimate relation with the outer world that it is possible to achieve.  To the primitive mind, everything is either friendly or hostile; but  experience has shown that friendliness and hostility are not the  conceptions by which the world is to be understood. Scientific  philosophy thus represents, though as yet only in a nascent condition,  a higher form of thought than any pre-scientific belief or  imagination, and, like every approach to self-transcendence, it brings  with it a rich reward in increase of scope and breadth and  comprehension. Evolutionism, in spite of its appeals to particular  scientific facts, fails to be a truly scientific philosophy because of  its slavery to time, its ethical preoccupations, and its predominant  interest in our mundane concerns and destiny. A truly scientific  philosophy will be more humble, more piecemeal, more arduous, offering  less glitter of outward mirage to flatter fallacious hopes, but more  indifferent to fate, and more capable of accepting the world without  the tyrannous imposition of our human and temporary demands.

II    THE PLACE OF SCIENCE IN A LIBERAL EDUCATION      I    Science, to the ordinary reader of newspapers, is represented by a  varying selection of sensational triumphs, such as wireless telegraphy  and aeroplanes, radio-activity and the marvels of modern alchemy. It is  not of this aspect of science that I wish to speak. Science, in this  aspect, consists of detached up-to-date fragments, interesting only  until they are replaced by something newer and more up-to-date,  displaying nothing of the systems of patiently constructed knowledge  out of which, almost as a casual incident, have come the practically  useful results which interest the man in the street. The increased  command over the forces of nature which is derived from science is  undoubtedly an amply sufficient reason for encouraging scientific  research, but this reason has been so often urged and is so easily  appreciated that other reasons, to my mind quite as important, are apt  to be overlooked. It is with these other reasons, especially with the  intrinsic value of a scientific habit of mind in forming our outlook  on the world, that I shall be concerned in what follows.    The instance of wireless telegraphy will serve to illustrate the  difference between the two points of view. Almost all the serious  intellectual labour required for the possibility of this invention is  due to three men--Faraday, Maxwell, and Hertz. In alternating layers  of experiment and theory these three men built up the modern theory of  electromagnetism, and demonstrated the identity of light with  electromagnetic waves. The system which they discovered is one of  profound intellectual interest, bringing together and unifying an  endless variety of apparently detached phenomena, and displaying a  cumulative mental power which cannot but afford delight to every  generous spirit. The mechanical details which remained to be adjusted  in order to utilise their discoveries for a practical system of  telegraphy demanded, no doubt, very considerable ingenuity, but had  not that broad sweep and that universality which could give them  intrinsic interest as an object of disinterested contemplation.    From the point of view of training the mind, of giving that  well-informed, impersonal outlook which constitutes culture in the  good sense of this much-misused word, it seems to be generally held  indisputable that a literary education is superior to one based on  science. Even the warmest advocates of science are apt to rest their  claims on the contention that culture ought to be sacrificed to  utility. Those men of science who respect culture, when they associate  with men learned in the classics, are apt to admit, not merely  politely, but sincerely, a certain inferiority on their side,  compensated doubtless by the services which science renders to  humanity, but none the less real. And so long as this attitude exists  among men of science, it tends to verify itself: the intrinsically  valuable aspects of science tend to be sacrificed to the merely  useful, and little attempt is made to preserve that leisurely,  systematic survey by which the finer quality of mind is formed and  nourished.    But even if there be, in present fact, any such inferiority as is  supposed in the educational value of science, this is, I believe, not  the fault of science itself, but the fault of the spirit in which  science is taught. If its full possibilities were realised by those  who teach it, I believe that its capacity of producing those habits of  mind which constitute the highest mental excellence would be at least  as great as that of literature, and more particularly of Greek and  Latin literature. In saying this I have no wish whatever to disparage  a classical education. I have not myself enjoyed its benefits, and my  knowledge of Greek and Latin authors is derived almost wholly from  translations. But I am firmly persuaded that the Greeks fully deserve  all the admiration that is bestowed upon them, and that it is a very  great and serious loss to be unacquainted with their writings. It is  not by attacking them, but by drawing attention to neglected  excellences in science, that I wish to conduct my argument.    One defect, however, does seem inherent in a purely classical  education--namely, a too exclusive emphasis on the past. By the study  of what is absolutely ended and can never be renewed, a habit of  criticism towards the present and the future is engendered. The  qualities in which the present excels are qualities to which the study  of the past does not direct attention, and to which, therefore, the  student of Greek civilisation may easily become blind.

Put that down, and use this; or, no, keep your  sword; the hilt will protect your hand in case I come down upon it.\"    He took up a stout ash stick and threw himself on guard again, waiting  for Roy's blow, which he turned off, but before the next could descend,  the boy's aim was disordered by a sharp dig in the chest from the end of  the ash stick; and so it was as he went on: before he could strike he  always received a prod in the chest, ribs, arms, or shoulders.    \"Oh, I say, Ben,\" he cried at last; \"I didn't know you could use a stick  like that.\"    \"Suppose not, my lad; but I knew you couldn't use a sword like that.  Now, I tell you what: you'd better come to me for an hour every morning  before breakfast, and I'll begin to make such a man of you as your  father would like to see when he comes back.\"    \"Well, I will come, Ben,\" said the lad; \"but my arm does not ache so  much now, and I don't feel quite beaten.  Let's have another try.\"    \"Oh, I'll try all day with you, if you like, sir,\" said the old soldier;  \"only, suppose now you stand on guard and let me attack.\"    \"With swords?\" said Roy, blankly.    \"No, no,\" said Ben, laughing; \"I don't want to hurt you.  We'll keep to  sticks.  Better still: I want you to get used to handling a sword, so  I'll have the stick and you shall defend yourself with a blade.\"    \"But that wouldn't be fair to you,\" cried Roy.  \"I might hurt you, while  you couldn't hurt me.\"    \"Couldn't I?\" said the old fellow, drily.  \"I'm afraid I could, and more  than you could me.  Now, then, take that blade.\"    He took one from the wall, a handsome-looking sword, upon which the  armourer who made it had bestowed a good deal of ingenious labour,  carving the sides, and ornamenting the hilt with a couple of beautifully  fluted representations in steel of the scallop shell, so placed that  they formed as complete a protection to the hand of the user as that  provided in the basket-hilted Scottish claymore.    \"Find that too heavy for you, sir?\"    \"It is heavy,\" said Roy; \"but one seems to be able to handle it easily.\"    \"Yes, sir; you'll find that will move lightly.  You see it's so well  balanced by the hilt being made heavy.  The blade comes up lightly, and,  with a fair chance, I believe I could cut a man in two with it after a  few touches on a grindstone.\"    \"Ugh!\" ejaculated Roy; \"horrid!\"    \"Oh, I don't know, sir.  Much more horrid if he cut you in two.  It's of  no use to be thin-skinned over fighting in earnest.  Man's got to defend  himself.  Now, then, let's give you a word or two of advice to begin  with.  A good swordsman makes his blade move so sharply that you can  hardly see it go through the air.  You must make it fly about like  lightning.  Now then, ready?\"    \"Yes; but you won't mind if I hurt you?\"    \"Don't you be afraid of doing that, sir.  If you hurt me, it'll serve me  right for being such a bungler.  _En garde_!\"    Roy threw himself into position, and the old soldier attacked him very  slowly, cutting at his neck on either side, then down straight at his  head, next at his arms and legs; and in every case, though in a bungling  way, Roy interposed his blade after the fashion shown by his adversary.    Then the old fellow drew back and rested the point of his ash stick upon  his toe, while Roy panted a little, and smiled with satisfaction.    \"Come,\" he said; \"I wasn't so bad there.\"    \"Oh, no, you weren't so bad there, because you showed that you'd got  some idea of what a sword's for; but when you're ready we'll begin  again.  May as well have something to think about till to-morrow  morning.  First man you fight with won't stop to ask whether you're  ready, you know.\"    \"I suppose not; but wait a minute.\"    \"Hour, if you like, sir; but your arms'll soon get hard.  Seems a pity,  though, that they're not harder now.  I often asked the master to let me  teach you how to use a sword.\"    \"Yes, I know; but my mother always objected.  She doesn't like swords.  I do.\"    \"Of course you do, sir.  It's a lad's nature to like one.  Ready?\"    \"Yes,\" cried Roy, standing on his guard; \"but look out this time, Ben,  because I mean you to have something.\"    \"That's right, sir; but mind this: I'm not going to let my stick travel  like a snail after a cabbage-leaf this time.  I'm going to cut as I  should with a sword, only I'm going to hit as if you were made of glass,  so as not to break you.  Now!\"    The old soldier's eyes flashed as he threw one foot forward, Roy doing  the same; but it was his newly polished sword that flashed as he  prepared to guard the cuts, taking care, or meaning to take care, to  hold his blade at such an angle that the stick would glance off.  The  encounter ended in a few seconds.  _Whizz, whirr, pat, pat, pat_, and  the elastic ash sapling came down smartly upon the boy's arms, legs,  sides, shoulders, and finished off with a rap on the head, with the  result that Roy angrily threw the sword jangling upon the floor, and  stood rubbing his arms and sides viciously.    \"You said you were going to hit at me as if I were made of glass,\" cried  the boy.    \"So I did.  Don't mean to say those taps hurt you?\"    \"Hurt?  They sting horribly.\"    \"Why, those cuts would hardly have killed flies, sir.  But why didn't  you guard?\"    \"Guard?  I did guard,\" cried Roy, angrily, as he rubbed away; \"but you  were so quick.\"    \"Oh, I can cut quicker than that, sir.  You see I got in before you did  every time.  I'd cut, and was on my way to give another before you were  ready for the first.  Come, they don't tingle now, do they?\"    \"Tingle?  Yes.  Here, I want a stick.  I'm not going to leave off  without showing you how it does hurt.\"    \"Better leave off now, sir,\" said the man, grinning.    \"But I don't want to,\" cried Roy; and picking up the sword which he had  handled with a feeling of pride, he took the other stick, and, crying  \"Ready!\" attacked in his turn, striking hard and as swiftly as he could,  but _crack, crack, crack_, wherever he struck, there was the defensive  sapling; and at last, with his arm and shoulder aching, the boy lowered  his point and stood panting, with his brow moist with beads of  perspiration.    \"Well done!\" cried Ben.  \"Now that's something like a first lesson.  Why, those last were twice as good as any you gave before.\"    \"Yes,\" said Roy, proudly; \"I thought I could make you feel.  Some of  those went home.\"    \"Not one of them, my lad,\" said Ben, smiling; \"you didn't touch me  once.\"    \"Not once?\"    \"No, sir; not once.\"    \"Is that the truth, Ben?\"    \"Every word of it, sir.  But never you mind that; you did fine; and if  you'll come to me every morning, I'll make you so that in three months I  shall have to look out for myself.\"    \"I don't seem to have done any good at all,\" said Roy, pettishly.    \"Not done no good, sir?  Why, you've done wonders; you've taken all the  conceit out of yourself, and learned in one lesson that you don't know  anything whatever about a sword, except that it has a blade and a hilt  and a scabbard.  And all the time you'd been thinking that all you had  to do was to chop and stab with it as easy as could be, and that there  was nothing more to learn.  Now didn't you?\"    \"Something like it,\" said Roy, who was now cooling down; \"but, of  course, I knew that you had to parry.\"    \"But you didn't know how to, my lad; and look here, you haven't tried to  thrust yet.  Here, give me a sharp one now.\"    \"No, I can't do any more,\" said Roy, sulkily.  \"I don't know how.\"    \"That's a true word, sir; but you're going to try?\"    \"No, I'm not,\" said Roy, whom a sharp sting in one leg from the worst  cut made a little vicious again.    \"Come, come, come,\" said the old soldier, reproachfully.  \"That aren't  like my master's son talking; that's like a foolish boy without anything  in his head.\"    \"Look here, Ben; don't you be insolent.\"    \"Not I, Master Roy.  I wouldn't be to you.  Only I speak out because I'm  proud of you, my lad, and I want to see you grow up into a man like your  father.  I tried hard not to hurt you, sir, but I suppose I did.  But I  can't say I'm sorry.\"    \"Then you ought to be, for you cut at me like a brute.\"    The old soldier shook his head sadly.    \"You don't mean that, Master Roy,\" he said; \"and it's only because  you're tingling a bit; that's all.\"    The man's words disarmed Roy, and the angry frown passed away, as he  said, frankly--    \"No, I don't mean it now, Ben.  The places don't tingle so; but I say,  there'll be black marks wherever you cut at me.\"    \"Never mind, sir; they'll soon come white again, and you'll know next  time that you've got to have your weapon ready to save yourself.  Well,  I dunno.  I meant it right, but you've had enough of it.  Some day Sir  Granby'll let you go to a big fencing-master as never faced a bit o'  steel drawn in anger in his life, and he'll put you on leather pads and  things, and tap you soft like, and show you how to bow, s'loot, and cut  capers like a Frenchman, and when he's done with you I could cut you up  into mincemeat without you being able to give me a scratch.\"    \"Get out!\" cried Roy.  \"You don't think anything of the sort.  What time  shall I come to-morrow morning--six?\"    \"No, sir, no.  Bed's very nice at six o'clock in the morning.  You stop  there, and then you won't be hurt.\"    \"Five, then?\" said Roy, sharply.    \"Nay, sir; you wait for the big fencing-master.\"    \"Five o'clock, I said,\" cried Roy.    The old soldier took the sword Roy had held, and fetching a "]]]
