Domitilla._]    The walls of the chambers of the catacombs are laid out in such a manner  as to have the effect of decorated apartments, just as was done in the  pagan tombs, and sometimes the pictures were a strange union of pagan and  Christian devices.    The above cut, from the Catacomb of S. Domitilla, has in the centre the  pagan god Orpheus playing his lyre, while in the alternate compartments of  the border are the following Christian subjects: 1, David with the Sling;  2, Moses Striking the Rock; 3, Daniel in the Lion's Den; 4, The Raising of  Lazarus. The other small divisions have pictures of sacrificial animals.  These two cuts will give you an idea of the catacomb wall-paintings.    The mosaics of the Middle Ages were of a purely ornamental character down  to the time of Constantine. Then, when the protection of a Christian  emperor enabled the Christians to express themselves without fear, the  doctrines of the church and the stories of the life of Christ and the  histories of the saints, as well as many other instructive religious  subjects, were made in mosaics, and placed in prominent places in churches  and basilicas. Mosaics are very durable, and many belonging to the early  Christian era still remain.    The mosaics at Ravenna form the most connected series, and are the best  preserved of those that still exist. While it is true in a certain sense  that Rome was always the art centre of Italy, it is also true that at  Ravenna the works of art have not suffered from devastation and  restoration as have those of Rome. After the invasion of the Visigoths in  A.D. 404, Honorius transferred the imperial court to Ravenna, and that  city then became distinguished for its learning and art. The Ravenna  mosaics are so numerous that I shall only speak of one series, from which  I give an illustration (Fig. 19).    This mosaic is in the church of S. Vitalis, which was built between A.D.  526 and 547. In the dome of the church there is a grand representation of  Christ enthroned; below Him are the sacred rivers of Paradise; near Him  are two angels and S. Vitalis, to whom the Saviour is presenting a crown;  Bishop Ecclesius, the founder of the church, is also represented near by  with a model of the church in his hand.    On a lower wall there are two pictures in which the Emperor Justinian and  the Empress Theodosia are represented: our cut is from one of these, and  shows the emperor and empress in magnificent costumes, each followed by a  train of attendants. This emperor never visited Ravenna; but he sent such  rich gifts to this church that he and his wife are represented as its  donors.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--JUSTINIAN, THEODORA, AND ATTENDANTS. _From a  mosaic picture at S. Vitalis, Ravenna._]    After the time of Justinian (A.D. 527-565) mosaics began to be less  artistic, and those of the later time degenerated, as did everything else  during the Middle or Dark Ages, and at last all works of art show less and  less of the Greek or Classic influence.    When we use the word miniature as an art term, it does not mean simply a  small picture as it does in ordinary conversation; it means the pictures  executed by the hand of an illuminator or _miniator_ of manuscripts, and  he is so called from the _minium_ or cinnabar which he used in making  colors.    In the days of antiquity, as I have told you in speaking of Egypt, it was  customary to illustrate manuscripts, and during the Middle Ages this art  was very extensively practised. Many monks spent their whole lives in  illuminating religious books, and in Constantinople and other eastern  cities this art reached a high degree of perfection. Some manuscripts have  simple borders and colored initial letters only; sometimes but a single  color is used, and is generally red, from which comes our word rubric,  which means any writing or printing in red ink, and is derived from the  Latin _rubrum_, or red. This was the origin of illumination or  miniature-painting, which went on from one step to another until, at its  highest state, most beautiful pictures were painted in manuscripts in  which rich colors were used on gold or silver backgrounds, and the effect  of the whole was as rich and ornamental as it is possible to imagine.    Many of these old manuscripts are seen in museums, libraries, and various  collections; they are very precious and costly, as well as interesting;  their study is fascinating, for almost every one of the numberless designs  that are used in them has its own symbolic meaning. The most ancient,  artistic miniatures of which we know are those on a manuscript of a part  of the book of Genesis; it is in the Imperial Library at Vienna, and was  made at the end of the fifth century. In the same collection there is a  very extraordinary manuscript, from which I give an illustration.    This manuscript is a treatise on botany, and was written by Dioskorides  for his pupil, the Princess Juliana Anicia, a granddaughter of the Emperor  Valentine III. As this princess died at Constantinople A.D. 527, this  manuscript dates from the beginning of the sixth century. This picture  from it represents Dioskorides dressed in white robes and seated in a  chair of gold; before him stands a woman in a gold tunic and scarlet  mantle, who represents the genius of discovery; she presents the legendary  mandrake root, or mandragora, to the learned man, while between them is  the dog that has pulled the root, and falls dead, according to the  fabulous story. This manuscript was painted by a masterly hand, and is  curious and interesting; the plants, snakes, birds, and insects must have  been painted from nature, and the whole is most skilfully done.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--THE DISCOVERY OF THE HERB MANDRAGORA. _From a MS.  of Dioskorides, at Vienna._]    During the Middle Ages the arts as practised in Rome were carried into all  the different countries in which the Romans made conquests or sent their  monks and missionaries to establish churches, convents, and schools. Thus  the mediaeval arts were practised in Gaul, Spain, Germany, and Great  Britain. No wall-paintings or mosaics remain from the early German or  Celtic peoples; but their illuminated manuscripts are very numerous:  miniature-painting was extensively done in Ireland, and many Irish  manuscripts remain in the collections of Great Britain.    When Charlemagne became the king of the Franks in 768, there was little  knowledge of any art among his northern subjects; in 800 he made himself  emperor of the Romans, also, and when the Franks saw all the splendor of  Rome and other parts of Italy, it was not difficult for the great emperor  to introduce the arts into the Frankish portion of his empire. All sorts  of beautiful objects were carried from Italy by the Franks, and great  workshops were established at Aix-la-Chapelle, the capital, and were  placed under the care of Eginhard, who was skilled in bronze-casting,  modelling, and other arts; he was called Bezaleel, after the builder of  the Tabernacle. We have many accounts of the wall-paintings and mosaics of  the Franks; but there are no remains of them that can be identified with  positive accuracy.    Miniature-painting flourished under the rule of Charlemagne and his  family, and reached a point of great magnificence in effect, though it was  never as artistic as the work of the Italian miniators; and, indeed,  gradually everything connected with art was declining in all parts of the  world; and as we study its history, we can understand why the terms Dark  Ages and Middle Ages are used to denote the same epoch, remarkable as it  is for the decay and extinction of so many beautiful things.      THE CENTRAL, OR ROMANESQUE PERIOD.    During the Romanesque Period (950-1250) architecture was pursued according  to laws which had grown out of the achievements and experiences of earlier  ages, and had reached such a perfection as entitled it to the rank of a  noble art. But this was not true of painting, which was then but little  more than the painting of the Egyptians had been, that is, a sort of  picture-writing, which was principally used to illustrate the doctrines of  religion, and by this means to teach them to peoples who had no books, and  could not have read them had they existed.    During all this time the art of painting was largely under the control of  the priests. Some artists were priests themselves, and those who were not  were under the direction of some church dignitary. Popes, bishops, abbots,  and so on, were the principal patrons of art, and they suggested to the  artists the subjects to be painted, and then the pictures were used for  the decoration of churches and other buildings used by the religious  orders. The monks were largely occupied in miniature-painting; artists  frequented the monasteries, and, indeed, when they were engaged upon  religious subjects, they were frequently under the same discipline as that  of the monks themselves.    Next to the influence of the church came that of the court; but in a way  it was much the same, for the clergy had great influence at court, and,  although painting was used to serve the luxury of sovereigns and nobles,  it was also true that these high personages often employed artists to  decorate chapels and to paint altar-pieces for churches at their expense,  for during the Romanesque period there was some painting on panels. At  first these panel-pictures were placed on the front of the altar where  draperies had formerly been used: later they were raised above the altar,  and also put in various parts of the church. The painting of the  Romanesque period was merely a decline, and there can be little more said  of it than is told by that one word.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--KING DAVID. _From a window in Augsburg  Cathedral._]    Glass-painting dates from this time. The very earliest specimens of which  we know "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24728"],[0,"Stories Of Georgia (#7)"],[1,"  proved himself to be, was fully sensible of the injustice to which  the Colonies were compelled to submit. On the 15th of August, 1769, he  addressed a letter to the Earl of Hillsborough, which was not read until  fifteen months after it was written. In this letter the governor warned  the British cabinet that the Colonies would never submit to taxation  without representation. There was no disaffection, he said, toward the  King or the royal family, but simply a determination on the part of the  people to stand on their rights. But the governor's letter lay unread  for fifteen months, and there was no reply to the numerous petitions  sent from the Colonies. At last the Americans determined to appeal to  the pockets instead of to the sentiments of the people of Great Britain.  They determined to import no goods whatever that could be manufactured  or produced at home.    This determination, instead of causing the British people to conciliate  the Americans by securing the repeal of unfriendly laws, turned the  popular opinion against the Colonies; and this feeling was intensified  by the Boston Tea Party. A bill was passed by both Houses of the British  Parliament to close the port of Boston, and the discussion of the  measure gave an opportunity to some of the statesmen of the mother  country to show their spite. Another law was passed, limiting and  cutting down the power of the representative assembly of Massachusetts,  and providing that town meetings should not be held except on permission  in writing from the royal governor. Another act was passed, giving the  governor of the Province the power to send to Great Britain or to other  Colonies persons indicted for murder or charged with capital crimes  committed in aiding the government of Massachusetts. These acts,  intended to humiliate the Colonies, had the effect of inflaming them,  and the Liberty Boys grew in numbers and determination.    [Illustration: Tondee's Tavern 055]    On the 20th of July, 1774, \"The Georgia Gazette,\" published at Savannah,  contained an invitation to the people of the Province to meet at  Tondee's Tavern on the 27th of July to take into consideration the  unjust laws that had been passed by the British Parliament. The cause  of Massachusetts was the cause of all. The meeting was held, and stood  adjourned to the 10th of August, in order to give all the parishes an  opportunity to be represented by delegates. Governor Wright, loyal to  the last, issued a proclamation warning the people of the Province to  avoid attending the meeting; but the proclamation was disregarded, and a  meeting of the people of the Province was held at Tondee's Tavern on  the 10th of August, 1774. Resolutions were adopted, declaring that  his Majesty's subjects in America owed the same allegiance, and were  entitled to the same rights and privileges, as their fellow-subjects  in Great Britain; that the act lately passed for blockading the port  of Boston was contrary to the British constitution; that the act for  abolishing the charter of Massachusetts Bay tended to the subversion of  American rights; that the Parliament of Great Britain had not, nor ever  had, the right to tax his Majesty's American subjects; and that every  demand for the support of government should be by requisition made to  the several houses of representatives. The resolutions covered all the  grievances of the people of the Colonies.    Meanwhile, Governor Wright was not idle. He called a convention of  Royalists, which met, and signed a protest against the resolutions.  Copies of this protest were made, and sent into all the parishes, by the  governor's friends. Under pressure, many timid men who were really in  sympathy with the Liberty Boys signed the protest. The signatures of  dead men were used, and other frauds practiced, in order to make the  demonstration in favor of the King sufficient to overawe those who  had pledged themselves to American independence. In all this, Governor  Wright was aided by the fact that the only newspaper in the Province,  \"The Georgia Gazette,\" was under his control. He was also aided by the  geographical situation of Georgia, and by his own personal popularity.  He had made a good governor. He had worked as hard for the prosperity  and progress of the Province as he now worked to prevent the people from  joining the movement for independence.    The governor was successful to the extent that he was able to prevent  Georgia from sending duly accredited representatives to the First  Continental Congress; and this fact has been taken by some writers of  history to mean that the spirit of liberty and independence was not as  earnest and as enthusiastic in Georgia as in the other Provinces. Later,  when Georgia was overrun by British and Tory influences, and appeared to  be conquered, ill-natured critics recalled the fact that her people were  slow to join hands with those who advocated resistance to tyranny.    When the South Carolina delegates to the First Continental Congress  returned to their homes, bearing with them copies of the Declaration of  Colonial Rights, the Liberty Boys of Georgia renewed their movement with  great zeal. Copies of the Declaration were distributed throughout the  Province. The result was, that the Liberty Boys grew steadily stronger  in numbers, and more defiant in action. An idea of the situation at this  time may be gathered from a letter written by Governor Wright to the  Earl of Dartmouth on the 13th of December, 1774. He declared that the  spirit of independence, or, as he called it, the spirit of enthusiasm,  which many were possessed of before, \"is raised to such a height of  frenzy, that God knows what the consequences may be, or what man or  whose property may escape their resentment.\"    No doubt the amiable governor misunderstood the situation. What he  regarded as \"frenzy\" was merely the eager desire and the determination  of the Liberty Boys of Georgia to redeem themselves in the eyes of their  brethren in the other Colonies. They were humiliated by their failure to  send representatives to the Continental Congress, and they endeavored to  redeem themselves by increased zeal and enthusiasm.    They arranged to hold a provincial congress in Savannah on the 18th  of January, 1775. Governor Wright, on hearing of this, determined to  convene the Provincial General Assembly on the same day, hoping and  believing that this would prevent a meeting of the Provincial Congress,  or greatly hamper its action. But the governor was mistaken. The  General Assembly met in response to the call, and so did the Provincial  Congress. Governor Wright addressed the members, declaring to them the  danger of the situation, and imploring them to be prudent and loyal.  The upper house of the General Assembly made a response agreeable to the  governor's expectations, but the lower house gave to its address a tone  of independence that was not at all pleasing to the King's officer. He  showed his displeasure, and placed a serious obstacle in the way of the  Liberty Boys by adjourning the General Assembly until the 9th of the  following May. The Assembly had met on the 18th of January, and was  adjourned on the 10th of February; so that the Liberty Boys, who made up  a majority of the lower house, had no time to appoint delegates to the  Philadelphia congress soon to be held, nor to take any official action  in behalf of the independence of Georgia.    Governor Wright's plans were certainly very shrewdly laid. His  adjournment of the General Assembly not only hampered the Provincial  Congress (or convention) that had met at Savannah simultaneously with  the legislature, but threw the delegates into confusion and disorder,  and was the means of causing the convention to adjourn without taking  such action as the friends of liberty hoped for. All that it did was  to elect three representatives to the Philadelphia congress. This  was something, but it was not enough. The Liberty Boys expected  the Provincial Convention to adopt all the measures and resolutions  suggested by the Continental Congress. They therefore felt mortified  when the convention adjourned, and left Georgia still outside the  continental association.    This event was a serious embarrassment to the other Colonies, and  aroused the anger of those friends of liberty who were unable to  understand the peculiar conditions that surrounded the movement for  independence in Georgia. The friends of liberty in South Carolina were  so indignant, that they denounced the Georgians \"as unworthy the  rights of freemen, and as inimical to the liberties of their country.\"  Throughout the Colonies, the partisans of American independence were  deeply wounded by the apparent hesitation of the Georgians, while the  Royalists were delighted.    Though the Provincial Convention remained in session only seven days  before adjourning, the delegates of St. John's Parish had withdrawn from  the body. These delegates insisted on an emphatic indorsement of the  acts of the Continental Congress, and they retired as soon as they  found there would be some difficulty in bringing some of the hesitating  members to their way of thinking. They retired, and selected Dr. Lyman  Hall to represent St. John's in the Philadelphia congress. He took his  seat in that body, and although he cast no vote, he made his voice heard  in the discussions.    In spite of all the drawbacks which the Liberty Boys in Georgia had  experienced, their enthusiasm did not cool. They never ceased their  efforts, and the independence movement continued to grow. The public  mind became more and more inflamed with resentment against the tyranny  of King George and his Parliament, as the people heard of the progress  of events in the more northern Colonies. By the 10th of May the people  of Savannah had heard of the shedding of American blood by British  troops at Lexington and Concord. As the news spread from parish to"]]]
