Sunday, June 17, 1838, I attended  meeting. Samuel H. Smith, a brother of the Prophet, and Elder  Daniel Cathcart preached. After meeting I and my wife were  baptized by Elder Cathcart, in Ambrosia, on Shady Grove Creek, in  Daviess County, Missouri. I was now a member of the Church, and  expected to live in strict obedience to the requirements of the  holy priesthood that ruled, governed, and controlled it. I must  do this in order to advance in the scale of intelligence unto  thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, and through  faithfulness and fidelity to the cause receive eternal increase  in the mansions that would be prepared for me in my Father's  kingdom.    Neighbor Stewart and myself each selected a place on the same  stream, and near where his three brothers, Riley, Jackson, and  Urban, lived. On my location there was a spring of pure, cold  water; also a small lake fed by springs. This lake was full of  fish, such as perch, bass, pickerel, mullet, and catfish. It was  surrounded by a grove of heavy timber, mostly hickory and oak. We  could have fish sufficient for use every day in the year if we  desired.    My home on Ambrosia Creek reminded me of the one I had left on  Luck Creek, Illinois; but it was on more rolling land, and much  healthier than the Illinois home had proven to us. I knew I could  soon replace, by labor, all the comfort I had abandoned when I  started to seek my salvation. I felt that I had greatly  benefitted my condition by seeking first the Kingdom of Heaven  and its righteousness; all else, I felt, would be added unto me.  But still I knew I must be frugal, industrious, and use much  care. I improved my farm as rapidly as I could, and was soon so  fixed that we were very comfortably established.    Meetings were held three times a week; also prayer and testimony  meetings - at the latter sacrament was administered. In these  meetings, as well as in everything I was called upon to do, I  tried hard to give satisfaction. I was a devout follower from the  first. Whatever duty was assigned me I tried to discharge with a  willing heart and ready hand. This disposition, on my part,  coupled with my views of duty, my promptness and punctuality,  soon brought me to the notice of the leading men of the Church.    The motives of the people who composed my neighborhood were pure;  they were all sincere in their devotions, and tried to square  their actions through life by the golden rule - \"Do unto others  as you would they should do unto you.\" The word of a Mormon was  then good for all it was pledged to or for. I was proud to  associate with such an honorable people.    Twenty miles northeast of my home was the settlement of Adam-on-  Diamond. It was on the east bank of Grand River, near the Three  Forks. Lyman White, one of the twelve apostles, was president of  that Stake of Zion. In July, 1838, Levi Stewart and myself  concluded to visit the settlement of Adam-on-Diamond. We remained  over night at the house of Judge Mourning. He was a Democrat. He  told us that at the approaching election the Whigs were going to  cast their votes, at the outside precincts, early in the day, and  then rush in force to the town of Gallatin, the county seat of  Daviess County, and prevent the Mormons from voting. The Judge  requested us to inform our people of the facts in the case, and  for us to see that the Mormons went to the polls in force,  prepared to resist and overcome all violence that might be  offered. He said the Whigs had no right to deprive the Mormons of  their right of suffrage, who had a right to cast their votes as  free and independent Americans.    The two political parties were about equally divided in Daviess  County. The Mormons held the balance of power, and could turn the  scale whichever way they desired. I had heard of Judge Mourning  as a sharp political worker, and I then thought he was trying to  carry out an electioneering job for his party.    We visited our friends at Adam-on-Diamond, and returned home.  While on this trip I formed the acquaintance of Solomon McBrier,  and purchased some cattle from him. He wished to sell me quite a  number, but as I did not want to be involved in debt I refused to  take them. I had a perfect horror of debt, for I knew that when a  man was in debt he was in nearly every respect a slave, and that  if I got in debt it would worry me and keep my mind from that  quiet repose so necessary for contemplating the beauties of  nature and communing with the Spirit regarding holy subjects.    Just before the election of August, 1838, a general notice was  given for all the brethren of Daviess County to meet at Adam-on-  Diamond. Every man obeyed the call. At that meeting the males  over eighteen years of age were organized into a military body,  according to the law of the Priesthood, and called The Host of  Israel. The first rank was a captain with ten men under him; next  was a captain of fifty - that is, he had five companies of ten;  next, the captain of a hundred, or of ten captains and companies  of ten. The entire male membership of the Mormon Church was then  organized in the same way.    This, as I was informed, was the first organization of the  military force of the Church. It was so organized by command of  God, as revealed through the Lord's prophet, Joseph Smith. God  commanded Joseph Smith to place the Host of Israel in a situation  for defense against the enemies of God and the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints.    At the same Conference another organization was formed - it was  called the Danites. The members of this order were placed under  the most sacred obligations that language could invent. They were  sworn to stand by and sustain each other; to sustain, protect,  defend, and obey the leaders of the Church, under any and all  circumstances unto death; and to disobey the orders of the  leaders of the Church, or divulge the name of a Danite to an  outsider, or to make public any of the secrets of the order of  Danites, was to be punished with death. And I can say of a truth,  many have paid the penalty for failing to keep their covenants.    They had signs and tokens for use and protection. The token of  recognition was such that it could be readily understood, and it  served as a token of distress by which they could know each other  from their enemies, although they were entire strangers to each  other. When the sign was given it must be responded to and  obeyed, even at the risk or certainty of death. The Danite that  would refuse to respect the token, and comply with all its  requirements, was stamped with dishonor, infamy, shame, disgrace,  and his fate for cowardice and treachery was death.    This sign or token of distress is made by placing the right hand  on the right side of the face, with the points of the fingers  upward, shoving the hand upward until the ear is snug between the  thumb and forefinger. I here pause, and ask myself the question:    \"Am I justified in making the above statement?\"    Those who think I am not should wait until they read the whole  story. It is my purpose and intention to free my mind and bring  to light some of the secret workings of the Priesthood.    To return to the election at Gallatin: The brethren all attended  the election. All things seemed to pass off quietly, until some  of the Mormons went up to the polls to vote. I was then lying on  the grass with McBrier and a number of others.    As the Mormons were going to the polls a drunken brute by the  name of Richard Weldorp stepped up to a little Mormon preacher by  the name of Brown and said:    \"Are you a Mormon preacher?\"    \"Yes, sir, I am.\"    \"Do you Mormons believe in healing the sick by laying on of  hands, speaking in tongues, and casting out devils?\"    \"We do,\" said Brown.    Weldon then said, \"You are a liar. Joseph Smith is an impostor.\"    With this, he attacked Brown, and beat him severely. Brown did  not resent it, but tried to reason with him; but without effect.    At this time a Mormon by the name of Hyrum Nelson attempted to  pull Weldon off Brown, when he was struck by half a dozen men on  the head, shoulders, and face. He was soon forced to the ground.  Just then Riley Stewart struck Weldon across the back of the head  with a billet of oak lumber and broke his skull. Weldon fell on  me, and appeared lifeless. The blood flowed freely from the  wound. Immediately the fight became general.    Gallatin was a new town, with about ten houses, three of which  were saloons. The town was on the bank of Grand River, and heavy  timber came near the town, which stood in a little arm of the  prairie. Close to the polls there was a lot of oak timber which  had been brought there to be riven into shakes or shingles,  leaving the heart, taken from each shingle-block, lying there on  the ground. These hearts were three square, four feet long,  weighed about seven pounds, and made a very dangerous, yet handy  weapon; and when used by an enraged man they were truly a class  of instrument to be dreaded.    When Stewart fell the Mormons sprang to the pile of oak hearts,  and each man, taking one for use, rushed into the crowd. The  Mormons were yelling:    \"Save him!\" and the settlers yelled:    \"Kill him!\"    The sign of distress was given by the Danites, and all rushed  forward, determined to save Stewart, or die with him. One of the  mob stabbed Stewart in the shoulder. He rose and ran, trying to  escape, but was again surrounded and attacked by a large number  of foes.    The Danite sign of distress was again given by John L. Butler,  one of the captains of the Host of Israel. Butler was a brave,  true man, and a leader that it was a pleasure to follow where  duty called. Seeing the sign, I sprang to my feet and armed  myself with one of the oak sticks. I did this because I was a  Danite, and my oaths that I had taken required"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23533"],[0,"A War-time Journal, Germany 1914 and German Travel Notes (#7)"],[1,"rough. Now and then pale bandaged faces looked out at us  from passing trains, and men on crutches hobbled by, and the horrors  of mutilating war came home to us all. At Goch we had to show our  passports, and have our luggage examined, but the reality proved not  nearly so bad as our imaginings, and on the whole the officials were  kind and courteous compared to our Altheim demon. The sun was setting  blood-red behind a distant line of black forest when we left Goch and  our enemies and imprisonment behind us and entered the Land of Promise.    We had all been saddened in the morning to learn that Mr. Ives'  strenuous efforts to get permission for the men left behind to go  soon, had met with a curt refusal from the Commandant at Frankfort.  \"When England returns our men, not before, and she had better be quick  about it,\" said he. But how true is Rochefoucauld's cynical  epigram--\"Nous avons tous assez de force pour supporter les maux  d'Autrui!\" Even our sympathy with, and sorrow for, those left in  Altheim could not damp the joy we felt to be free again; and when we  quitted Goch, the German frontier station, I thought how blessed would  be that day when \"They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and  their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up a sword  against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall  sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall  make them afraid.\"                                    GERMAN TRAVEL NOTES                                \"TAKIN' NOTES\"      He who knows his Rhine and loves it must take of its charms in small  doses, or satiety is the outcome. There are those, of course, who can  travel from Dan to Beersheba and cry, \"'Tis all barren\"; but the  ordinarily intelligent traveller may find much to delight and interest  on the banks of the Rhine, always provided that he suits his mood to  his environment, and takes but little of Rhine scenery at a time. For  surely between Coblentz and Bingen there is an iteration as regards  castles and ruins which is downright wearisome. Do we not between  these points find Lahneck, Marksburg, Sterrenberg, Liebenstein, The  Mouse, Rheinfels, The Cat, Schoenburg, Gutenfels, The Pfalz, Stahleck,  Furstenberg, Hohneck, Sooneck, Falkenburg, Rheinstein, and Ehrenfels?    Moreover, there is an affinity of form and colour and, indeed, of  situation between all these which produces the effect of perpetual  repetition. And we owe Byron a grudge for having written such trite  words as \"the castled crag\" in relation to the Rhine, since no  commonplace mind of the present day acquainted with his works but has  fallen back on \"the castled crag\" to describe Drachenfels or Marksburg  or Rheinfels, because, forsooth, its own English is too limited to  supply a better adjective. So it is that conventional and inadequate  English is perpetuated and individual force and expression are lost  because people accept the ideas of others and will not seek language  to convey their own.    All of which above prosing is the result of a day on the Rhine when  the thermometer registered 74 deg. to 84 deg. in the shade, and a white vapour  hid the banks of the river from Koeln till close on Bonn. At Bonn a  huge party of \"personally-conducted\" American tourists came on board.  Their sharp, keen, eager, shrewd faces and shrill voices proclaimed  their nationality at the outset. They were all obviously outside the  pale of Society, and their thirst for information and keen interest in  their surroundings were amazing. One learned before long that they had  \"done\" the Paris Exhibition and meant to have a \"look in\" at most  European countries before sailing from Naples. They took the whole  ship into their confidence before a quarter of an hour had passed; and  we shared alike in thrilling intelligences conveyed through the medium  of Baedeker's pages. \"The castled crag\" resounded from one end of the  boat to the other; and as for Roland and Hildegunde, the tragedy of  their lives was discussed, and exclaimed over, and lamented, until,  happily, a bend of the river hid Nonnenwerth from sight.    In emphatic contrast to the nervous alertness of the Yankee was the  spectacle of the middle-class German and his ways. He sat by his  plain, stout, ill-dressed Frau, with his back to the scenery, and ate.  Occasionally he spoke in monosyllables: more often he drank; but the  end and object of his Rhine trip seemed to be that of consuming as  much food as lay within the limits of possibility. What Nemesis has in  store for him and those of his manner of life I can only imagine!    At a table near us sat three women and two men. Directly we left Koeln  a waiter set forth trays in front of them laden with coffee,  zwiebacks, hoernchens, and eggs. This meal over, they sat sleepily  blinking their eyes, whisking away flies, and mopping the moisture  from their faces until the sound of \"Eis! meine Herrschaften!\" \"Bier!  meine Herrschaften!\" roused them from their lethargy. Ices and beer  and cherries and peaches successively filled up the weary hours until  \"the tocsin of the soul, the dinner bell,\" carried joy to their  hearts. I can never forget the rapturous look of anticipation and  satisfaction which those stolid middle-class Teutonic countenances  wore when \"Mittagsessen\" was announced. They shook off their normal  and habitual torpidity, and cheerfully elbowed their neighbours,  nearly tumbling down the companion-ladder in their eagerness to be  first in the field. They lost no time over the unlovely detail of  tucking a corner of their napkins down their necks, and smoothing its  folds over their protuberant persons; and they studied the  Speise-Karte with a conscientiousness that was worthy of a better  cause.    Dinner began with a tolerably good soup, followed by tough roast beef,  cut in thick slices and garnished with carrots, peas and beans. Next  came veal, equally uneatable, and then a surprise in the shape of  Rhine salmon; after which followed chicken, salad, and _compote_.  Finally, a stodgy pudding, sufficiently satisfying, and dessert. Not  one item of the menu was neglected by the five. They calmly and  conscientiously and readily ate through the Speise-Karte from start to  finish. Then they returned to deck, only to order coffee and ices, and  called for a bottle of champagne, three of light Rhine wine, and a  plateful of peaches; out of which they brewed a cup, ladling it from a  Taunus ware bowl into their long Munich glasses, and sipping it lazily  all the afternoon between such trifles as Kuchen and fresh relays of  cherries. They ate and drank from Koeln to Bingen with rare intervals  of dozing, and I never once saw any of the party take the faintest  interest in the Rhine, so far as its banks were concerned.    It was a relief to turn from such grossness to its antithesis in the  shape of two American ladies who sat near us. They were  well-preserved, well-bred spinsters under forty. Everything about them  was dainty and exquisitely neat. I likened them in my mind to bowls of  dried rose-leaves--the freshness gone, the perfume left. Such was  their intense and intelligent interest in travel that, rather than  lose a timber-framed village or historic castle, a vineyard or  watch-tower, they abstained from lunch and picnicked lightly on deck  off tea and eggs and hoernchen. They knew the legends of the Rhine as  you and I know (or ought to know) our Prayer-Books. They had studied  the history of Germany, and mastered the intricacies alike of the  Thirty Years' War and of the Hohenzollern pedigree; and they talked  well, expressing their ideas in good Saxon words; at times, perhaps a  trifle pedantic, but never offensively so.    As the day wore on the temperature became almost overpowering. The  water reflected a blinding glare, and a heat like that of a burning  fiery furnace was radiated from the engines. I was wondering whether a  hammock in a cool English garden would not have been more desirable,  when I heard a plaintive, uneducated American voice behind me ask a  question of its mate which exactly embodied my own unuttered  sentiments:    \"What _I_ want to know, Jake, is: Is this pleasure, or ain't it? Did  we come here to enjoy ourselves, or what?\"    JAKE: \"Wall, I guess you ain't used to travelling around, my dear, and  you don't understand it. Oh, yes\" (with an obvious effort), \"this is  real fust-class pleasure, this is!\"    MRS. JAKE: \"Wall, I'm darned! I'd as lief be in our store.\"    JAKE: \"Sakes alive! You _do_ surprise me! Think what Keren-Happuch  Jones will say when you mention casual on your return something that  happened when you was sailing up the Rhine. She'll die of envy, she  will, and spite to think you've seen more'n her.\"    MRS. JAKE (cheered somewhat): \"Wall, I reckon, Jake, there's summat in  that. Keren-Happuch don't like anyone to do what she don't do.\"    JAKE: \"And then, my dear, think of your noo bonnet from Paris! That'll  be another pill for Keren-Happuch to swallow.\"    MRS. JAKE: \"My! Yes! I don't think much of Europe, anyway, but I could  never have bought that bonnet in Baltimore. But, Jake, do look on the  map and tell me when we get to Heidelberg.\"    JAKE: \"It ain't any good my lookin', my dear, for I wasn't raised to  these sort of things, and I'm darned if I know where to find it.\"    A groan from Mrs. Jake, followed by: \"Wall, I reckon when I find  myself again in No. 9, Mount Mascal Street, I won't want to go  travelling around even to cut out Keren-Happuch Jones.\"    I came to the rescue at this point, and showed the good lady where  Heidelberg lay. She was a hard-featured, plain woman of some  thirty-eight summers, her hair was dragged back uncompromisingly from  her forehead, and there were no \"adulteries of art\" about either  coiffure or costume.    \"You see,\" she said apologetically, \"Jake here and me are travelling  around, and the only way we can"]]]
