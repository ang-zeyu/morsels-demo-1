And even  Billee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not half  so placatingly as in former days. Buck never came near Spitz without  snarling and bristling menacingly. In fact, his conduct approached that  of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down before Spitz's  very nose.    The breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their  relations with one another. They quarrelled and bickered more than ever  among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. Dave and  Sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the  unending squabbling. Francois swore strange barbarous oaths, and stamped  the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. His lash was always singing  among the dogs, but it was of small avail. Directly his back was turned  they were at it again. He backed up Spitz with his whip, while Buck  backed up the remainder of the team. Francois knew he was behind all the  trouble, and Buck knew he knew; but Buck was too clever ever again to be  caught red-handed. He worked faithfully in the harness, for the toil  had become a delight to him; yet it was a greater delight slyly to  precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces.    At the mouth of the Tahkeena, one night after supper, Dub turned up a  snowshoe rabbit, blundered it, and missed. In a second the whole team  was in full cry. A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest  Police, with fifty dogs, huskies all, who joined the chase. The rabbit  sped down the river, turned off into a small creek, up the frozen bed of  which it held steadily. It ran lightly on the surface of the snow, while  the dogs ploughed through by main strength. Buck led the pack, sixty  strong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. He lay down low  to the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing forward, leap  by leap, in the wan white moonlight. And leap by leap, like some pale  frost wraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.    All that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men  out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things  by chemically propelled leaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to  kill--all this was Buck's, only it was infinitely more intimate. He was  ranging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the living  meat, to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm  blood.    There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life  cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when  one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is  alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the artist,  caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to the  soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it came  to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining after  the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the  moonlight. He was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the parts of  his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb of Time.  He was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being,  the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was  everything that was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing  itself in movement, flying exultantly under the stars and over the face  of dead matter that did not move.    But Spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the pack  and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend  around. Buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the frost  wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and larger  frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of  the rabbit. It was Spitz. The rabbit could not turn, and as the white  teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man  may shriek. At sound of this, the cry of Life plunging down from Life's  apex in the grip of Death, the fall pack at Buck's heels raised a hell's  chorus of delight.    Buck did not cry out. He did not check himself, but drove in upon Spitz,  shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. They rolled  over and over in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his feet almost as  though he had not been overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder and  leaping clear. Twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel jaws of  a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and lifting lips  that writhed and snarled.    In a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As  they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the  advantage, the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He seemed  to remember it all,--the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the  thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm.  There was not the faintest whisper of air--nothing moved, not a leaf  quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in  the frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit, these  dogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an  expectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and  their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was nothing new or  strange, this scene of old time. It was as though it had always been,  the wonted way of things.    Spitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and  across Canada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner of  dogs and achieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his, but never  blind rage. In passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his  enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. He never rushed till  he was prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first  defended that attack.    In vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog.  Wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by  the fangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding,  but Buck could not penetrate his enemy's guard. Then he warmed up and  enveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he tried  for the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and  each time and every time Spitz slashed him and got away. Then Buck took  to rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his  head and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the  shoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. But instead,  Buck's shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly away.    Spitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and panting  hard. The fight was growing desperate. And all the while the silent and  wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. As Buck  grew winded, Spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for  footing. Once Buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs started  up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle sank  down again and waited.    But Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness--imagination. He  fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as  though attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept  low to the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz's left fore leg. There  was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three  legs. Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and  broke the right fore leg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz  struggled madly to keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming  eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in  upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists  in the past. Only this time he was the one who was beaten.    There was no hope for him. Buck was inexorable. Mercy was a thing  reserved for gentler climes. He manoeuvred for the final rush. The  circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on  his flanks. He could see them, beyond Spitz and to either side, half  crouching for the spring, their eyes fixed upon him. A pause seemed to  fall. Every animal was motionless as though turned to stone. Only Spitz  quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth, snarling with  horrible menace, as though to frighten off impending death. Then Buck  sprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely  met shoulder. The dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as  Spitz disappeared from view. Buck stood and looked on, the successful  champion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found  it good.          Chapter IV. Who Has Won to Mastership      \"Eh? Wot I say? I spik true w'en I say dat Buck two devils.\" This was  Francois's speech next morning when he discovered Spitz missing and Buck  covered with wounds. He drew him to the fire and by its light pointed  them out.    \"Dat Spitz fight lak hell,\" said Perrault, as he surveyed the gaping  rips and cuts.    \"An' dat Buck fight lak two hells,\" was Francois's answer. \"An' now we  make good time. No more Spitz, no more trouble, sure.\"    While Perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the  dog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. Buck trotted up to the place  Spitz would have occupied as leader; but Francois, not noticing him,  brought Sol-leks to the coveted position. In his judgment, Sol-leks was  the best lead-dog left. Buck sprang upon Sol-leks in a fury, driving him  back and standing in his place.    \"Eh? eh?\" Francois cried, slapping his thighs gleefully. \"Look at dat  Buck. Heem keel dat Spitz, heem t'ink to take de job.\"    \"Go 'way, Chook!\" he cried, but Buck refused to budge.

The churchyard is overlooked on its northern side by the back windows  of some rickety old wooden houses, suggestive of an easy conflagration,  and dangerously near the church. They date from the time of Queen  Elizabeth, and stand on a piece of the ground formerly devoted to  Bartholomew Fair, the memory of which is perpetuated in the adjoining  street (Cloth Fair), where the humble shops in front of the same houses  are said to be a survival of the ancient booths. They run close up to  the #North Porch#, which projects into the street from the transept. It  was erected in 1893, at the same time that the transept was restored.  The porch is similar in material and character to that on the west, with  some differences in detail, the chief of which are that the figure over  the door represents St. Bartholomew, with only one window on each side  of it--in this case square-headed, with a label-moulding--and the  chequered diaper covers the whole wall-surface of the upper storey. The  Saint is raising his right hand in the act of blessing, and holds in the  left a knife, which has become his emblem, as the instrument of his  passion. A scroll entwined about the effigy bears the appropriate words  (in English) from Rahere's vision: _Almighty God this spiritual house  shall inhabit and hallow it._ The upper chamber here is reserved for the  mission-lady working in the district.    [Illustration: THE NORTH PORCH                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    The face of the transept visible above displays three lancet-headed  windows of the clerestory; the spaces are laid out in ornamental panels;  and there is an octagonal turret on the right, with battlements and a  pointed roof.    The rest of the church is hemmed in, and for the most part concealed, by  tumble-down houses, forming a labyrinth of narrow winding passages about  the walls, and even encroaching upon them--a bit of old London which has  escaped the modern spirit of improvement, and would appear to be full of  suggestive material for the writer of romance. As we thread our way  through this network round the east end and south side, to reach the  entrance once more, we get an occasional glimpse of the choir and Lady  Chapel through a gap in the surrounding buildings; but are far more  impressed with the sense of poverty and ruin than by anything in the way  of architecture, which can be much better seen and described from  within. The new schools in the south-east corner (built to supersede the  old structure which still remains attached to the north triforium) are  worth a visit _en route_: and so, perhaps, is the abandoned  burial-ground outside the south transept, if only as a melancholy  souvenir of the past.    The church is open every day, and the services are as follows:                           SUNDAYS      8.15 a.m.  Holy Communion.      11 a.m.    Mattins.      11.45 a.m. Holy Communion (choral) and Sermon.      4 p.m.     Children's Service and Catechizing.      7 p.m.     Evensong and Sermon.

Photo._]          CHAPTER III    THE INTERIOR      As soon as the visitor enters the church, he will be able to contrast  the Norman work of the twelfth century with that which succeeded it in  the thirteenth, as both are brought into juxtaposition immediately  within the western doorway. The surviving #Bay of the Nave#, which  probably marks the boundary of the monastic choir, now answers the  purpose of a vestibule to the church, from the body of which it is  separated by the organ-screen, the instrument being carried on a gallery  built against the western wall. The nave arches, at each end of the  passage thus formed, are semicircular in shape, with a zigzag moulding  on the inner sides, and rest on massive rounded piers, with square bases  and abaci and simple cushioned capitals--the whole obviously of early  twelfth century date. The northern arch has been built up, and a small  Tudor doorway, inserted in the wall, gives access to the transept.    At right angles with the southern arch, and on each side of the entrance  to the choir aisle, or ambulatory, there is a cluster of #Early English  Columns#, still bearing a portion of the vaulting-shafts, from which it  can be seen that the pitch of the roof to the nave aisle was much higher  than that of the ambulatory to which it was attached, probably implying  a corresponding difference in the height of the nave. The slender  columns on both sides are alike in their moulded bases, which resemble  those left (_in situ_) among the ruins outside, as far as the latter can  be discerned; but there is an interesting variety in other details, the  capitals of the northern group being cut into foliage, while they are  moulded on the south, where also the shafts are banded.    #The Organ-screen# (modern) is an elegant piece of work in oak, panelled  and canopied in the Perpendicular style. With the organ-front above, it  forms an admirable background to the choir-stalls, which are arranged in  the space within the old central tower, the seats for the congregation  being carried along towards the east, facing each other chapel-wise, in  continuation of the stalls on either side. A description of the organ  will be found in the Appendix.    [Illustration: THE SOUTH AISLE FROM THE WEST, SHOWING THE EARLY                 ENGLISH SHAFTS                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    #The Tower Arches# are worth particular notice. Those on the north and  south are pointed, and much narrower than the others, which have a bold  semicircular sweep. An intelligible reason sometimes assigned for the  difference is that the area enclosed is not exactly square, and that it  became necessary for the builders to carry the transept-arches to a  point, to accommodate them to the oblong plan, and bring the upper  mouldings into line with those of the rounded arches between the choir  and nave. On this supposition the result has been called \"an incidental  use of the pointed arch,\" examples of which occur elsewhere (_e.g._, at  Christ Church, Oxford, and other churches of the transitional period)  before it became a distinguishing feature of the later style. It is  tolerably certain, however, that the tower was rebuilt in the fifteenth  century, and that the north and south arches were then altered from  their first design. And their appearance is strongly in favour of a  reconstruction; for it will be noticed that, instead of the usual  elegant inclination in a continuous curve from the spring to the apex,  they rise perpendicularly for some distance above the piers on either  side, and then take rather an abrupt turn inwards, suggesting the  imposition of a pointed heading on an original stilted form. Further  signs of alteration appear on the northern side, where the capitals have  been recut in the Perpendicular fashion; but the Norman pilasters and  mouldings on the south remain untouched. On both sides the double  serrated line of moulding claims attention, as an example of the  \"saw-tooth\" ornament found in early work. A difference will be observed  in the corbels supporting the mouldings of the eastern and western  arches. The former are much more boldly cut, with all the appearance of  original work, while those on the west would seem to have been modified  by some architect of the Perpendicular age. In the decoration of the  inner tower walls there is a lozenge-shaped panel in each of the  spandrels, sculptured into a floral ornament something like the Greek  honeysuckle, a shallow arcading in the angles, and a cornice of zigzag  moulding extending round the walls, immediately below the modern ceiling  (1886) of panelled oak.    The piers at the angles of the tower are not very much more massive  than the adjacent walls, and do not strike one as capable of sustaining  a superstructure of any great weight. It may therefore be inferred that  the tower was a low one, as is in fact borne out by the representation  on the Priory seal, where the circular turrets at each end of the church  are shown to exceed it in height. #The North Transept#, which had been  occupied for many years as a blacksmith's forge, was re-opened on 5th  June, 1893, after restoration to something like its original state. It  is now used as a morning chapel, with an altar in a recess on the north  side, slightly to the east of the porch already described, by which the  church is entered from Cloth Fair.[1]    [Illustration: THE NORTH TRANSEPT AND SCREEN                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    [Illustration: THE NORTH TRANSEPT FROM THE SOUTH                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    Both transepts had been injured by fire, and were originally much  deeper than they are at present, but to have rebuilt them exactly on the  old lines would have involved the suppression of a right of way and the  purchase of neighbouring properties, besides adding to the cost of  heating and maintenance,"]]]
