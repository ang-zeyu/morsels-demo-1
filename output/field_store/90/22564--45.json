One could not honestly  call the building a beautiful one, but in its unrestored condition it is  quite picturesque and quaint. It possesses a spacious verandah painted  bright blue, and two windows at each side with elaborate ornamentations  similarly coloured red and blue. A red-bordered white flag with the  national lion in the centre floats over the Palace, and an elaborate  castellated archway, with a repetition of the Persian Lion on either  side, stands in front of the main entrance in the square of the Palace.  So also do four useful kerosene lamp-posts. The telegraph office is to  the right of the Palace with a pretty garden in front of it.    The most important political personage living in Resht is His Excellency  Salare Afkham, called Mirza Fathollah Khan, one of the richest men in  Persia, who has a yearly income of some twenty thousand pounds sterling.  He owns a huge house and a great deal of land round Resht, and is much  respected for his talent and kindly manner. He was formerly Minister of  the Customs and Posts of all Persia, and his chest is a blaze of Russian,  Turkish and Persian decorations of the highest class, bestowed upon him  by the various Sovereigns in recognition of his good work. He has for  private secretary Abal Kassem Khan, the son of the best known of modern  Persian poets, Chams-echoera, and himself a very able man who has  travelled all over Asia, Turkestan and Europe.    Persia is a country of disappointments. There is a general belief that  the Swiss are splendid hotel-keepers. Let me give you my experience of  the hotel at Resht kept by a Swiss.    \"Can this be the Swiss hotel?\" I queried to myself, as the driver pulled  up in front of an appallingly dirty flight of steps. There seemed to be  no one about, and after going through the greater part of the building, I  eventually came across a semi-starved Persian servant, who assured me  that it was. The proprietor, when found, received me with an air of  condescension that was entertaining. He led me to a room which he said  was the best in the house. On inspection, the others, I agreed with him,  were decidedly not better. The hotel had twelve bedrooms and they were  all disgustingly filthy. True enough, each bedroom had more beds in it  than one really needed, two or even three in each bedroom, but a  _coup-d'oeil_ was sufficient to assure one's self that it was out of the  question to make use of any of them. I counted four different coloured  hairs, of disproportionate lengths and texture, on one bed-pillow in my  room, leaving little doubt that no less than four people had laid their  heads on that pillow before; and the pillow of the other bed was so black  with dirt that I should imagine at least a dozen consecutive occupants of  that couch would be a low estimate indeed. As for the sheets, blankets,  and towels, we had better draw a veil. I therefore preferred to spread my  own bedding on the floor, and slept there. The hotel boasted of three  large dining-rooms in which a few moth-eaten stuffed birds and a case or  two of mutilated butterflies, a couple of German oleographs, which set  one's teeth on edge, and dusty, stamped cotton hangings formed the entire  decoration.    To give one an appetite--which one never lost as long as one stayed  there--one was informed before dinner that the proprietor was formerly  the Shah's cook. After dinner one felt very, very sorry for the poor  Shah, and more so for one's self, for having put up at the hotel. But  there was no other place in Resht, and I stuck to my decision that I  would never get angry, so I stood all patiently. The next day I would  start for Teheran.    One talks of Persian extortion, but it is nothing to the example offered  to the natives by Europeans in Persia. The charges at the hotel were  exorbitant. One paid as much per day as one would at the very first hotel  in London, New York, or Paris, such as the Carlton, the Waldorf, or Ritz.  Only here one got absolutely nothing for it except very likely an  infectious disease, as I did. In walking bare-footed on the filthy  matting, while taking my bath, some invisible germ bored its way into the  sole of my right foot and caused me a good deal of trouble for several  weeks after. Animal life in all its varieties was plentiful in all the  rooms.    Previous to starting on the long drive to the capital I had to get some  meat cooked for use on the road, but it was so putrid that even when I  flung it to a famished pariah dog he refused to eat it. And all this,  mind you, was inexcusable, because excellent meat, chickens, eggs,  vegetables, and fruit, can be purchased in Resht for a mere song, the  average price of a good chicken, for instance, being about 5_d._ to  10_d._, a whole sheep costing some eight or ten shillings. I think it is  only right that this man should be exposed, so as to put other travellers  on their guard, not so much for his overcharges, for when travelling one  does not mind over-paying if one is properly treated, but for his  impudence in furnishing provisions that even a dog would not eat. Had it  not been that I had other provisions with me I should have fared very  badly on the long drive to Teheran.    It may interest future travellers to know that the building where the  hotel was at the time of my visit, August, 1901, has now been taken over  for five years by the Russian Bank in order to open a branch of their  business in Resht, and that the hotel itself, I believe, has now shifted  to even less palatial quarters!    The Imperial Bank of Persia has for some years had a branch in Resht, and  until 1901 was the only banking establishment in the town.

Resht is an odious place in every way. It is, as it were, the \"Port Said\"  of Persia, for here the scum of Armenia, of Southern Russia, and of  Turkestan, stagnates, unable to proceed on the long and expensive journey  to Teheran. One cannot go out for a walk without being accosted by any  number of impostors, often in European clothes, who cling like leeches  and proceed to try to interest you in more or less plausible swindles.  One meets a great many people, too, who are on the look out for a \"lift\"  in one's carriage to the Persian capital.    I paid quite an interesting visit to a near relation of the Shah's, who  was the guest of the local Head Mullah. The approach to the Mullah's  palace was not attractive. I was conveyed through narrow passages, much  out of repair, until we arrived in front of a staircase at the foot of  which lay in a row, and in pairs, shoes of all sizes, prices, and ages,  patiently waiting for their respective owners inside the house. A great  many people were outside in the courtyard, some squatting down and  smoking a kalian, which was passed round after a puff or two from one  person to the other, care being taken by the last smoker to wipe the  mouthpiece with the palm of his hand before handing it to his neighbour.  Others loitered about and conversed in a low tone of voice.    A Mullah received me at the bottom of the staircase and led me up stairs  to a large European-looking room, with glass windows, cane chairs, and  Austrian glass candelabras. There were a number of Mullahs in their long  black robes, white or green sashes, and large turbans, sitting round the  room in a semicircle, and in the centre sat the high Mullah with the  young prince by his side. They all rose when I entered, and I was greeted  in a dignified yet very friendly manner. A chair was given me next to the  high Mullah, and the usual questions about one's family, the vicissitudes  of one's journey, one's age, one's plans, the accounts of what one had  seen in other countries, were duly gone through.    It was rather curious to notice the interest displayed by the high Mullah  in our South African war. He seemed anxious to know whether it was over  yet, or when it would be over. Also, how was it that a big nation like  Great Britain could not conquer a small nation like the Boers.    \"It is easier for an elephant to kill another elephant,\" I replied, \"than  for him to squash a mosquito.\"    \"Do you not think,\" said the Mullah, \"that England is now an old nation,  tired and worn--too old to fight? Nations are like individuals. They can  fight in youth--they must rest in old age. She has lived in glory and  luxury too long. Glory and luxury make nations weak. Persia is an  example.\"    \"Yes, there is much truth in your sayings. We are tired and worn. We have  been and are still fast asleep in consequence. But maybe the day will  come when we shall wake up much refreshed. We are old enough to learn,  but not to die yet.\"    He was sorry that England was in trouble.    Tea, or rather sugar with some drops of tea on it was passed, in tiny  little glasses with miniature perforated tin spoons. Then another  cross-examination.    \"Do you drink spirits and wine?\"    \"No.\"    \"Do you smoke?\"    \"No.\"    \"You would make a good Mussulman.\"    \"Possibly, but not probably.\"    \"In your travels do you find the people generally good or bad?\"    \"Taking things all round, in their badness, I find the people usually  pretty good.\"    \"How much does your King give you to go about seeing foreign countries?\"    \"The King gives me nothing. I go at my own expense.\"    This statement seemed to take their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22125"],[0,"The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance (#7)"],[1,"'s helplessness before organized power--a sense which, as we  have seen, the early Renaissance, with its belief in the omnipotence of  the individual, totally lacked. This was not without a decided influence  on art. In the last three decades of his long career, Titian did not  paint man as if he were as free from care and as fitted to his  environment as a lark on an April morning. Rather did he represent man  as acting on his environment and suffering from its reactions. He made  the faces and figures show clearly what life had done to them. The great  \"Ecce Homo\" and the \"Crowning with Thorns\" are imbued with this feeling  no less than the equestrian portrait of Charles the Fifth. In the \"Ecce  Homo\" we see a man with a godlike personality, humbled by the imperial  majesty, broken by the imperial power, and utterly unable to hold out  against them. In the \"Crowning with Thorns\" we have the same godlike  being almost brutalised by pain and suffering. In the portrait of the  Emperor we behold a man whom life has enfeebled, and who has to meet a  foe who may crush him.    Yet Titian became neither soured nor a pessimist. Many of his late  portraits are even more energetic than those of his early maturity. He  shows himself a wise man of the world. \"Do not be a grovelling  sycophant,\" some of them seem to say, \"but remember that courtly manners  and tempered elegance can do you no harm.\" Titian, then, was ever ready  to change with the times, and on the whole the change was toward a  firmer grasp of reality, necessitating yet another advance in the  painter's mastery of his craft. Titian's real greatness consists in the  fact that he was as able to produce an effect of greater reality as he  was ready to appreciate the need of a firmer hold on life. In painting,  as I have said, a greater effect of reality is chiefly a matter of light  and shadow, to be obtained only by considering the canvas as an enclosed  space, filled with light and air, through which the objects are seen.  There is more than one way of getting this effect, but Titian attains it  by the almost total suppression of outlines, by the harmonising of his  colours, and by the largeness and vigour of his brushwork. In fact, the  old Titian was, in his way of painting, remarkably like some of the best  French masters of to-day. This makes him only the more attractive,  particularly when with handling of this kind he combined the power of  creating forms of beauty such as he has given us in the \"Wisdom\" of the  Venetian Royal Palace, or in the \"Shepherd and Nymph\" of Vienna. The  difference between the old Titian, author of these works, and the young  Titian, painter of the \"Assumption,\" and of the \"Bacchus and Ariadne,\"  is the difference between the Shakspeare of the \"Midsummer-Night's  Dream\" and the Shakspeare of the \"Tempest.\" Titian and Shakspeare begin  and end so much in the same way by no mere accident. They were both  products of the Renaissance, they underwent similar changes, and each  was the highest and completest expression of his own age. This is not  the place to elaborate the comparison, but I have dwelt so long on  Titian, because, historically considered, he is the only painter who  expressed nearly all of the Renaissance that could find expression in  painting. It is this which makes him even more interesting than  Tintoretto, an artist who in many ways was deeper, finer, and even more  brilliant.      =XIV. Humanity and the Renaissance.=--Tintoretto grew to manhood when the  fruit of the Renaissance was ripe on every bough. The Renaissance had  resulted in the emancipation of the individual, in making him feel that  the universe had no other purpose than his happiness. This brought an  entirely new answer to the question, \"Why should I do this or that?\" It  used to be, \"Because self-instituted authority commands you.\" The answer  now was, \"Because it is good for men.\" In this lies our greatest debt to  the Renaissance, that it instituted the welfare of man as the end of all  action. The Renaissance did not bring this idea to practical issue, but  our debt to it is endless on account of the results the idea has  produced in our own days. This alone would have made the Renaissance a  period of peculiar interest, even if it had had no art whatever. But  when ideas are fresh and strong, they are almost sure to find artistic  embodiment, as indeed this whole epoch found in painting, and this  particular period in the works of Tintoretto.      =XV. Sebastiano del Piombo.=--The emancipation of the individual had a  direct effect on the painter in freeing him from his guild. It now  occurred to him that possibly he might become more proficient and have  greater success if he deserted the influences he was under by the  accident of birth and residence, and placed himself in the school that  seemed best adapted to foster his talents. This led to the unfortunate  experiment of Eclecticism which checked the purely organic development  of the separate schools. It brought about their fusion into an art which  no longer appealed to the Italian people, as did the art which sprang  naturally from the soil, but to the small class of _dilettanti_ who  considered a knowledge of art as one of the birthrights of their social  position. Venice, however, suffered little from Eclecticism, perhaps  because a strong sense of individuality was late in getting there, and  by that time the painters were already well enough educated in their  craft to know that they had little to learn elsewhere. The one Venetian  who became an Eclectic, remained in spite of it a great painter.  Sebastiano del Piombo fell under the influence of Michelangelo, but  while this influence was pernicious in most cases, the hand that had  learned to paint under Bellini, Cima, and Giorgione, never wholly lost  its command of colour and tone.      =XVI. Tintoretto.=--Tintoretto stayed at home, but he felt in his own  person a craving for something that Titian could not teach him. The  Venice he was born in was not the Venice of Titian's early youth, and  his own adolescence fell in the period when Spain was rapidly making  herself mistress of Italy. The haunting sense of powers almost  irresistible gave a terrible fascination to Michelangelo's works, which  are swayed by that sense as by a demonic presence. Tintoretto felt this  fascination because he was in sympathy with the spirit which took form  in colossal torsoes and limbs. To him these were not, as they were to  Michelangelo's enrolled followers, merely new patterns after which to  model the nude.    But beside this sense of overwhelming power and gigantic force,  Tintoretto had to an even greater degree the feeling that whatever  existed was for mankind and with reference to man. In his youth people  were once more turning to religion, and in Venice poetry was making its  way more than it had previously done, not only because Venice had become  the refuge of men of letters, but also because of the diffusion of  printed books. Tintoretto took to the new feeling for religion and  poetry as to his birthright. Yet whether classic fable or biblical  episode were the subject of his art, Tintoretto coloured it with his  feeling for the human life at the heart of the story. His sense of power  did not express itself in colossal nudes so much as in the immense  energy, in the glowing health of the figures he painted, and more still  in his effects of light, which he rendered as if he had it in his hands  to brighten or darken the heavens at will and subdue them to his own  moods.    He could not have accomplished this, we may be sure, if he had not had  even greater skill than Titian in the treatment of light and shadow and  of atmosphere. It was this which enabled him to give such living  versions of biblical stories and saintly legends. For, granting that an  effect of reality were attainable in painting without an adequate  treatment of light and atmosphere, even then, the reality would look  hideous, as it does in many modern painters who attempt to paint people  of to-day in their every-day dress and among their usual surroundings.  It is not \"Realism\" which makes such pictures hideous, but the want of  that toning down which the atmosphere gives to things in life, and of  that harmonising to which the light subjects all colours.    It was a great mastery of light and shadow which enabled Tintoretto to  put into his pictures all the poetry there was in his soul without once  tempting us to think that he might have found better expression in  words. The poetry which quickens most of his works in the Scuola di San  Rocco is almost entirely a matter of light and colour. What is it but  the light that changes the solitudes in which the Magdalen and St. Mary  of Egypt are sitting, into dreamlands seen by poets in their moments of  happiest inspiration? What but light and colour, the gloom and chill of  evening, with the white-stoled figure standing resignedly before the  judge, that give the \"Christ before Pilate\" its sublime magic? What,  again, but light, colour, and the star-procession of cherubs that imbue  the realism of the \"Annunciation\" with music which thrills us through  and through?    Religion and poetry did not exist for Tintoretto because the love and  cultivation of the Muses was a duty prescribed by the Greeks and Romans,  and because the love of God and the saints was prescribed by the Church;  but rather, as was the case with the best people of his time, because  both poetry and religion were useful to man. They helped him to forget  what was mean and sordid in life, they braced him to his task, and  consoled him for his disappointments. Religion answered to an  ever-living need of the human heart. The Bible was no longer a mere  document wherewith to justify Christian dogma. It was rather a series of  parables and symbols pointing at all times to the path that led to a  finer and nobler life.
