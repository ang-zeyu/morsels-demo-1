On the       reverse: The Evacuation of Boston. The American army advances in       good order toward the town, which is seen at a distance, while       the British army flies with precipitation toward the strand, to       embark on board the vessels with which the roads are covered. In       the front of the picture, on the side of the American army,       General Washington appears on horseback, amid a group of       officers, to whom he seems to be pointing out the retreat of the       enemy.         Legend: HOSTIBUS PRIMO FUGATIS.         On the Exergue: BOSTONIUM RECUPERATUM, DIE 17 MARTII, MDCCLXXVI.         The gold medal for General Gates represents the head of that       general, with this legend: HORATIO GATES, DUCI STRENUO, COMITIA       AMERICANA.         On the reverse: The enemy's general, at the head of his army, who       are grounding their arms, presents his sword to the American       general, whose troops stand with shouldered arms.

The gold medal of General Greene represents the head of that       general, with this legend: NATHANIELI GREEN, EGREGIO DUCI,       COMITIA AMERICANA.         On the reverse: A Victory treading under feet broken arms.         Legend: SALUS REGIONUM AUSTRALIUM.         On the Exergue: HOSTIBUS APUD EUTAW DEBELLATIS, DIE 8 SEPTEMBRIS,       MDCCLXXXI.         The medal in gold for General Morgan, and those in silver for       Colonels Howard and Washington, were to be indicative of the       several circumstances which attended the victory at the Cowpens       on the 17th of January, 1781, in conformity to a special       resolution of Congress.         It may not be foreign to the purpose to add that dies have       formerly been engraved under the direction of Dr. Franklin,[20]       for striking the gold medal for General Wayne, and the silver       medals for Colonels de Fleury and Stewart, emblematic of their       gallant conduct in storming the works of Stony Point, sword in       hand.                       [Footnote 20: This is an error. The medals for                     General Wayne and Major Stewart were composed, at                     the request of Mr. Jefferson, by the French Royal                     Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, in                     1789.

The encounter had excited him not a little. \"Uncle Tom,  that fellow seemed to know you?\"    \"Yes, I know that boy. His name is Napoleon Martell, although they call  him Nappy for short. He is the son of Nelson Martell, one of our rivals  in business, a man who occupies the floor above us in this building.\"    \"I didn't know Nappy was much of a scrapper,\" was Sam Rover's comment.  \"I thought he was too much of a dude to fight.\"    \"He certainly is a dude as far as appearances go,\" answered Jack; \"but  he has the manner of a brute. I wish now I'd had the chance to give him  a good licking,\" he went on heartily.    \"You had better go slow when it comes to fighting,\" returned his uncle.  \"A fight seldom settles anything.\"    \"Didn't you ever have any fights, Uncle Sam?\"    At this direct question Sam Rover's face became a study while his  brother Tom looked at him rather quizzically.    \"Yes! I had my share of fights when I was a boy,\" admitted the uncle.  \"But, looking back, I think a good many of them might have been  avoided. Of course, I expect a boy to take his own part and not be a  coward. But a fight isn't always the best way to settle a difficulty.\"    Once back in the offices, Jack did not hesitate to tell his father  about what had happened. In the meantime, an office boy rewrapped the  bundle, securing it this time with a stout cord.    \"I am sorry to hear about this trouble, Jack,\" said his father  seriously. \"I don't want you to grow up into a scrapper.\"    \"But, Dad, I couldn't stand by and see that fellow abuse a poor little  peddler like that,\" answered the son. \"It wasn't fair at all! What  right had that Nappy Martell to order the man away?\"    \"No right, that I know of. Jack, except that Mr. Martell owns some  stock in the company that owns this building; but that would be a very  far-fetched right at the best.\"    \"I guess those Martells are all tarred from the same stick,\" was Tom  Rover's comment. \"The father is just as overbearing as the son.\"    \"Do you know what I'm inclined to think?\" remarked Sam Rover, as he  walked over and closed the door to the outer office so that the clerks  might not hear what was said. \"I'm inclined to think that Nelson  Martell is a good deal of a crook.\"    \"And that's just my idea of the man, too,\" added Tom Rover. \"What do  you think, Dick?\"    At this direct question the oldest of the three brothers pursed up his  lips in concentrated thought.    \"To tell the truth, I don't know exactly what to think,\" he answered  slowly. \"Some of the things that Nelson Martell is trying to put  through are certainly rather shady. Still, they may be within the  strict letter of the law, and if that is so it would hardly be fair to  call the man a crook.\"    When Jack returned home, he, of course, told his cousins of his  encounter at the entrance to the office building.    \"It's a pity you didn't have a chance to give Martell one in the eye or  in the nose,\" was Randy's comment. \"Such a brute deserves to be hauled  down a peg or two.\"    \"Well, I rather think I gave his ear a pretty good twist,\" answered  Jack, grinning.    \"You ought to have made him pick up that bundle he flung into the  gutter,\" added Fred.    \"I couldn't do much of anything with the crowd gathering around. My!  how the people do flock together when the least thing happens! If we  had stayed there another minute or two, we might have had a thousand  people around us.\"    With so many things to be thought of and done previous to the departure  for Colby Hall, the subject of Nappy Martell was soon dismissed. All  the boys were wondering what they had better put in their trunks and  suitcases.    \"Gee! I've got enough stuff planned out to fill five trunks,\" declared  Randy. \"I want to take all my clothing, and my fishing outfit, and my  football and baseball togs, and my gym suit, and I'd like to take along  my dumbbells, and my physical culture exerciser, and maybe a shotgun,  and that favorite paddle of mine, and----\"    \"And about five thousand other things,\" finished his twin. \"I'm in the  same boat. But we've simply got to cut down and take only the things  that are actually necessary.\"    \"We won't need any baseball things during this term,\" declared Jack.  \"The Fall is the time for football--not baseball. And say! we don't  want to forget our skates. There's a river up there and also a lake; so  if the winter gets cold enough there ought to be some dandy skating.\"    \"Yes. And if the lake is large enough there ought to be a chance for  some ice-boating,\" added Fred.    At last, with the aid of their parents, the four boys got their trunks  and suitcases packed. They were to leave home for Colby Hall on  Wednesday morning, and on Tuesday evening their folks gave them a  little send-off in the shape of a party given at Dick Rover's  residence. At this gathering many of their boy friends were present, as  well as a number of girls along with Mary and Martha. All of the young  folks had an exceedingly pleasant time, which was kept up until  midnight.    \"And now for Colby Hall!\" exclaimed Jack, after the party had come to  an end.    \"That's it,\" returned Fred. \"Colby Hall and the best times ever!\"    \"So say we all of us!\" came from the twins.          CHAPTER VI    ON THE TRAIN      \"Ready?\"    \"I've been ready for the last half hour.\"    \"So have I. Come on, if we're going to catch that train.\"    \"Yes, boys, you don't want to miss the train,\" came from Mrs. Dick  Rover. She gazed at Jack fondly. \"Oh, dear! how I hate to have you go!\"    \"And how I do hate to see Fred leave!\" sighed Mrs. Sam Rover.    \"And my twins!\" murmured Tom's wife. \"I suppose they'll be getting into  all sorts of mischief at that boarding school.\"    \"Oh, Ma! we're going to be regular little lambs there,\" declared Andy.    \"Just you wait and see what fine records we send home,\" added his twin.    \"The automobiles are waiting, boys,\" broke in Dick Rover. \"Come. The  train is due to leave in twenty minutes, and you know how crowded  traffic is around the Grand Central Terminal.\"    There were hasty good-byes, a number of kisses and words of cheer, and  then the four boys left their mothers and the girls and ran down to  where two automobiles were standing at the curb. The twins and their  father leaped into one, and Jack and Fred and their fathers into the  other, and in a moment more the two machines were gliding down  Riverside Drive on the way to the Grand Central Terminal at  Forty-second Street.    It was a perfect autumn day, and all four of the lads were in the best  of spirits. To be sure, the fact that they were leaving home to be gone  for several months sobered them a trifle; but all were eager to find  out what was in store for them rather than to give thought to what had  been left behind.    As might have been expected, there was a perfect jam of automobiles and  carriages in the vicinity of the Terminal, and as a consequence the  lads had barely time to get aboard the train which was to carry them to  Haven Point, the town on the outskirts of which Colby Hall was located.    \"Take care of yourselves!\" cried Dick Rover.    \"Learn all you can,\" added his brother Sam.    \"And go slow on mischief,\" warned Tom.    \"We'll remember everything,\" came in a chorus from the four boys; and  then, as they waved their hands to their parents, the long train pulled  out of the big, gloomy station and the trip to the boarding school was  begun.    Haven Point was located in the heart of New England, so that the boys  had a ride of several hours ahead of them. They had seats in a parlor  car, two on one side and two on the other, and they proceeded without  delay to make themselves comfortable, the porter aiding them in  disposing of their handbaggage.    \"Good-bye to old New York!\" cried Jack. \"Won't we have a lot of things  to talk about when we get back!\"    \"I'm just crazy to see Colby Hall, to find out what it really looks  like,\" said Andy.    \"That picture we had of it looked pretty good,\" was Fred's comment.  \"But, of course, you can't always tell by a picture.\"    \"Not much!\" vouchsafed Randy. \"A building may look all right enough in  a picture and still be about ready to tumble down.\"    The boys had left home in the middle of the forenoon, and expected to  have their lunch on the train before reaching Haven Point.    \"When lunch time comes I'm going to fill up,\" declared Andy. \"No  telling what sort of grub we'll get at the Hall.\"    \"Father said they used to have first-class eats at Putnam Hall,\"  declared Fred.    \"Not always!\" cried Jack. \"At one time, while Captain Putnam was away,  the food got so bad there that the cadets rebelled and left the  school.\"    \"Oh, that was before our fathers went to Putnam Hall,\" answered Randy.  \"I heard about that, too. But while our fathers were there, the food  was very good, indeed.\"    After about half an hour's ride the train halted at a station, and  among the passengers to get aboard were two youths with suitcases.    \"Hello! what do you know about this?\" cried Jack, surprised. \"If there  isn't Spouter Powell! I wonder what he is doing down here. He doesn't  live in this town.\"    \"And look at the fellow who is with him!\" burst out Fred. \"Did you ever  see such a fat chap in your life?\"    \"Oh, say! I'll bet I know who that fellow is,\" declared Randy. \"It must  be Spouter's friend, Will Hendry. Spouter told me about him. They call  him Fatty.\"    \"And he fits his name,\" declared Randy. \"Here they come now. They must  have seats in this car.\"    Spouter Powell, a tall,"]]]
