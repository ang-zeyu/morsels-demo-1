Supposing that the tube is now ready to be drawn down, the operator  will remove it from the flame, and will gently pull the ends apart,  interrupting his turning as little as possible.  If the tube be pulled  too hard, or if the area heated be too small (about three-eighths of  an inch in length in the case given would be proper), it will be found  that the ends of the two portions of the tube will be nearly closed at  a very sharp angle (nearly a right angle to the length of the tube),  that the ends will be thin, and that a long length of very fine tube  will be produced.  To heat a short length of tube and pull hard and  suddenly is the proper way to make a very fine capillary tube, but, in  general, this is what we want to avoid.    If the operation be successfully performed, the drawn-down tube will  have the appearance exhibited, which is suitable either for  subsequently closing or handling by means of the drawn-down portion.  The straightness of the point can be obtained by a little practice in  \"feeling\" the glass when the tube is rotated as it cools just before  it loses its viscous condition.    When the operation is carried out properly the shoulder of the \"draw\"  should be perfectly symmetrical and of even thickness, and its axis  regarded as that of a cone should lie in the axis of the tube  produced.  The operation should be repeated till the student finds  that he can produce this result with certainty, and he should not be  discouraged if this takes several days, or even weeks.  Of course, it  is probable that within the first hour he will succeed in making a  tolerable job, but it is his business to learn never to make anything  else.    Fig. 9.    Fig. 10. Diagram of a folded end.    Sec. 20.  Closing and blowing out the End of a Tube.    When it is desired to close the end of a particular bit of tube, this  is easily done by heating the end, and at the same time heating the  end of a waste bit of tube or rod;  the ends, when placed in contact,  stick together, and a point can be drawn down as before.  [Footnote:  \"Point\" is here used in the technical sense, i.e.  it is a thin tail  of glass produced by drawing down a tube.]  Having got a point, it  will be found that the thin glass cools enough to allow of the point  being handled after a few moments.    The most convenient way of reducing the point to a suitable length  (say 1.5 inch) is to fuse it off in the flame, but this must be done  neatly;  if a tail is left it may cause inconvenience by catching, or  even piercing the finger and breaking off.  The blow-pipe flame being  turned down to a suitable size, and the shoulder of the \"draw\" having  been kept warm meanwhile, let the tip of the flame impinge on a point  where the diameter is about half that of the undrawn tube, and let the  temperature be very high (Fig.  11).  The tube is to be inclined to  the flame so that the latter strikes the shoulder normally, or  nearly so.  Then, according to circumstances, little or much of the  glass can be removed at will by drawing off the tail (Fig.  12), till,  finally, a small drop of melted glass only, adheres to the end of the  now closed tube (Fig.  13).    Fig. 11.    Fig.  12.    Fig.  13.    Fig. 14.    When this is satisfactorily accomplished, heat the extreme end of the  tube most carefully and equally, holding it in such a position that  the glass will tend to flow from the bead back on to the tube, i.e.  hold the closed end up to the flame, the tube being, say, at 45  degrees to the horizontal.  Then when the temperature is such as to  indicate complete softness lift the tube to the mouth, still holding  the tube pointing with its closed end a little above the horizontal,  and blow gently.  A beginner almost always blows too hard.    What is wanted, of course, is a continued pressure, to give the  viscous glass time to yield gradually, if it is uniform;  or else  intermittent puffs to enable the thinner parts, if there are any, to  cool more, and hence become more resisting than the thicker ones.  In  any case a little practice will enable the operator to blow out a  round and even end--neither thicker nor thinner than the rest of the  tube.    Sec. 21.  To make a Weld.    To begin with, try on two bits of glass of the same size, i.e.  cut a  seven-inch length of glass in half by scratching it with the knife,  and pulling the ends apart with a slight inclination away from the  scratch.  In other words, combine a small bending moment with a  considerable tensional stress.  It is important to learn to do this  properly.  If the proportions are not well observed, the tube will  break with difficulty, and the section will not be perpendicular to  the main length.  If the knife is in good order it will make a fine  deep scratch--the feel of the glass under the knife will enable the  operator to decide when the scratch is made.  The operation of cutting  large tubes will be treated further on.  The two halves of the tube  being held one in each hand, and one tube closed at one end, the  extremities to be united will be warmed, and then put in the flame as  before.    Fig. 16.    There are many ways of proceeding--perhaps the easiest is as follows.  As soon as the glass shows signs of melting at the ends--and care  should be taken that much more is not heated--take both bits out of  the flame.  Stop rotating for a moment, and resting the arms carefully  on the edge of the  table, raise the tubes above the flame and bring  the ends swiftly and accurately together.  This is a case of \"sudden  death no second attempt at making the ends meet can be allowed;  if  the tubes join in any other than a perfectly exact manner a kink more  or less objectionable will result.  In practice the operator will  learn to bring the ends together, commencing at one point; i.e.  the  axes of the tubes will be inclined at first, so as to cause adherence  at one spot only.  If this is not quite \"fair\", then less damage is  done in moving one tube slightly up or down to get the contact exact.  The tubes will then be closed upon one another as if they were hinged  at the joint.  This must be done lightly, yet sufficiently, to ensure  that the glass is actually in contact all round.    Having gone so far, replace the tubes--now one--in the flame, and  carefully rotating the glass, raise the temperature higher than in the  operation just described, in fact the higher the temperature, short of  burning the glass, the better.  Take the tube out of the flame and  blow into the open end, turning constantly as before.  One puff is  enough.  Then turn and pull the glass apart till it is of the same  diameter and thickness throughout, and feel that it is straight as  before.    Though it is in general of high importance that the joint should be  well heated, the beginner will probably find that he \"ties up\" his  glass as soon as it gets really soft.    If his object is to make one joint--at any cost--then let him be  careful to use two bits of exactly the same kind of glass, and only  get the temperature up to the viscous stage.  If the joint be then  pulled out till it is comparatively thin, it will probably stand (if  of soda glass); certainly, if of lead glass, though in this case it  may not be sound.  In any case the joint should be annealed in the  asbestos box if practicable, otherwise (unless between narrow tubes)  with the asbestos rag.  Care must be taken that the asbestos is dry.    Sec. 22.  To weld two Tubes of different Sizes.    To do this, the diameter of the larger tube must be reduced to that of  the smaller.  The general procedure described in drawing down must be  followed, with the following modification.  In general, a greater  length of the tube must be heated, and it must be made hotter.  The  tube is to be gradually drawn in the flame with constant turning till  the proper diameter and thickness of glass are attained.    Fig. 16.    For this operation time must be allowed if the operator's hands are  steady enough to permit of it; the shoulder should form partly by the  glass sinking in and partly by the process of drawing the hot glass  out.  A shoulder properly prepared is shown in the sketch.  Beginners  generally make the neck too thin on large tubes, and too thick on  smaller ones.  There ought to be no great difference in thickness of  glass between the neck on the larger tube, and the smaller tube.  The  diameters should be as nearly as possible alike.    Having drawn down the larger tube to a neck, take it out of the flame,  and as it cools pull and turn till the neck is of the right thickness  and is perfectly straight, i.e.  make the final adjustment outside the  flame, and to that end have the neck rather too thick (as to glass)  before it is taken out.  It is not necessary to wait till the neck  gets cold before the end can be cut off. Make a scratch as before--this  will probably slightly damage the temper of the file knife, but  that must be put up with.  Hold the tube against the edge of the  table,  so that the scratch is just above the level of the rim, and  strike the upper part a smart blow with the handle of the glass knife  rather in the direction of its length.  [Footnote: A bit of hoop iron  nailed against the side of the table is a very convenient arrangement,  and it need not project appreciably above the general level of the  rim.]    Of course this applies to a tube where economy has been exercised and  the end is short.  If the tail is long enough to form a handle, the  tube may be pulled apart as before.  As a rule a temporary joint  between a tube and a rod is not strong enough to enable the shoulder  to be broken at the scratch by mere pulling.  The ends to be welded  must be broken off very clean and true.  Subsequent operations are to  be carried out as already described.    Sec. 23.  The above operations will be easily performed on tubes up to  half an inch in diameter, if they are not too"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22790"],[0,"The accomplisht cook (#7)"],[1,"the meat, two Pigeons also forc't, two  Chickens, two boned of each, and filled with some minced veal or  mutton, with some interlarded Bacon, or Beef-suet, and season it  with Cloves, Mace, Pepper, Salt, and some grated parmison or none,  grated bread, sweet Herbs chopped small, yolks of Eggs, and Grapes,  fill the skins, and stitch up the back of the skin, then put them in  a deep dish, with some Sugar, strong broth, Artichocks, Marrow,  Saffron, Sparrows, or Quails, and some boiled Sparagus.
