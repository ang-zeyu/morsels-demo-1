That was just what the wise old elephant wanted.    Then he pulled the bamboo slowly along the ground, as you see in the  picture, taking care to give one or two more twists in case the knots  came undone. He pulled the bamboo lap by lap; that is, he pulled the  bamboo for about a yard, then he let go and took hold of the bamboo  farther up; he pulled again for another yard, and so on. In this way  he at last pulled the bunch of bananas quite out of the trap.    I need not tell you how he and Salar enjoyed that feast!    And the hunters, who were hiding in the trees around, laughed and  laughed at the trick the wily old elephant had played on them! For, as  you see, he got the bananas and yet escaped from that trap! He beat  the men at their own game!    But now I must tell you about other animals,--first about buffaloes.  They are the brave knights who helped that timid little lady, the blue  deer. They are just as wonderful as the elephants, in their own way.          CHAPTER VI    Buffaloes: The Knights of the Jungle      There are three or four kinds of buffaloes that live in different  countries. The kind that lives in America you may have already heard  about. I am sorry to say that hunters have killed so many of them,  that there are very few buffaloes left in the United States now; and  these few are kept in parks.    So in this book I shall tell you about another kind of buffalo, that  lives in the jungles of India. These are the buffaloes that have to  live in herds just because they have to guard themselves from the  tiger. Yet they are much bigger than all other kinds of buffaloes in  the world. Many of them are more than ten feet long, and a span taller  than a tall man.    They have two huge horns which stand outward, one from each side of  the head. Each horn is at least a yard long; and there are some  buffaloes that have horns two yards long! (See the picture facing the  next page.)    So you can understand that this kind of buffalo is a strong and mighty  animal. But still, if just one buffalo tried to fight a tiger, the  tiger could kill him every time. Why?    Because the tiger is much _quicker_ than the buffalo. The tiger could  jump to the side to escape the buffalo's horns. Then the tiger could  turn quickly, and strike the buffalo on the neck from behind. And  though the buffalo's neck is very thick, the tiger himself is so  strong that he could break the buffalo's neck at one blow.    So, to guard against the tiger, the buffaloes have to live together  like a band of soldiers, so that the tiger never gets the chance of  catching just one buffalo alone.    Now I shall tell you how these buffaloes live. They live in a part of  the country where there is plenty of water, and lots of trees and  grass. There is sure to be a stream or two in the jungles there, like  the one where we saw the buffaloes drinking at midnight.    When the buffaloes are feeding in the jungle, and wandering here and  there to find good grass to eat, they always try to remain somewhere  near one of these streams.    Why do they do that? To drink, of course.    [Illustration: The Buffalo that lives in India]    And as the country is hot, they may want to drink more than once in  the day.    Still, there is another reason why they like to be near water. Can you  tell what it is?    \"To bathe in the water, when it is hot,\" you may say.    That is quite true; the buffaloes do enjoy a good bath. In fact, they  like to remain in the water for a long time, when the sun is very hot.  Then they lie down in the shallow part, and remain neck deep in the  water. And every now and again they dip their heads in the water to  keep them cool.    But even when the sun is not at all hot, when the sky is cloudy, the  buffaloes like to go into a stream or a pond. Why?    \"Of course to wash themselves, and make themselves clean,\" you may  say.      _Buffaloes Cover Body with Mud against Flies_    No, my dear, you are wrong this time! Like some little boys, buffaloes  do not _want_ to make themselves clean! In fact, the buffaloes go into  the stream or the pond to _cover themselves with mud_! To _wallow_, as  it is called. They do that by rolling in the mud where the water is  shallow.    And why do they want to cover themselves with mud? Because of the  tormenting flies! Buffaloes of this kind do not have long hair on  their necks, like the American buffaloes. In fact, they do not have  much hair anywhere on their bodies--just like the ordinary cows which  you have seen near your home. So they are very much tormented by the  flies.    I have told you that an elephant can \"swat\" the flies with a bough  which he holds in his trunk. But the buffalo has no trunk, and his  tail can whisk off the flies for only a yard around. So, what can the  buffalo do to guard other parts of his body from the flies?    The only thing he can do is to go down into the mud, roll about, and  cover himself with the mud. Then he does not feel the flies at all,  even if they swarm all over him. And he need not trouble to work his  tail at all, as he is protected all over by the mud.    And when he comes out to feed again, if the sun happens to be very hot  at that time, he does not mind it. Why? Because the mud on his body  keeps off the sun. So, you see, the mud is useful to the buffalo in  two ways.    But now come with me into the jungle while I show you all that the  buffaloes do.    You must _imagine_ that I am taking you quietly through the jungle,  where the buffalo herd is grazing right ahead of us. We are following  them from behind. You must be careful not to make a sound. If you  should tread on a rotten twig, the buffaloes would hear the sound as  far away as a quarter of a mile.    In another book I shall tell you why all animals that keep their _ears  close to the ground_ while they are feeding can _hear a sound a long  way off_.    But now let us hide behind this bush for a minute, and watch the herd.  They are eating the grass as they walk along. But do you see the  wonderful way in which they are arranged? It is just like the shape of  the moon when it is new, that is, something like the letter C, and  which we call a crescent.    You saw at the midnight pool that, when the buffaloes drink or march,  they are in rows close together, like soldiers. But when they are  eating grass, they could not be in rows; because then they would be  too close together to pick out the best bits of grass. So, how could  they have enough to eat, and yet guard themselves from danger? To do  this they thought of arranging themselves in the form of a crescent.      _How Buffaloes Guard against Tiger while Feeding_    It is a big crescent, as there are so many buffaloes that make it up.  The ends of the crescent bend in toward each other, just as if the two  tips of the letter C were to close up a little, leaving only a small  opening between the tips.    The buffaloes have their faces toward the _outside_ of the crescent.  So, as we are following the buffaloes from behind, we are looking at  them through the gap between the tips.    There are only bulls in the line making up the crescent; the cows and  the calves come behind them, so that they are _inside_ the crescent.  So you see, while the buffaloes are grazing and moving along, if they  meet any danger, the Papa buffaloes will face the danger. And as the  Mammas and the children are inside the crescent, they are quite safe.    This is the way the buffaloes feed and move along:    The Papas on the outside of the crescent tear off a mouthful of grass,  with one or two bites, and walk on a step or two while they are  munching the mouthful. Then, with another bite or two, they take a  fresh mouthful and walk on a step or two while they are munching that.  In this way they leave enough grass for the Mammas and the young  buffaloes that are following them.    But now let us come out of this thicket, and go after the herd very  quietly from behind. We shall see some wonderful things.    You notice at once that the Mammas and the children do not show any  fear at all, as they graze along; they are quite sure that the Papas  are taking good care of them all the time. The little ones even play  about here and there.    See that very young calf! He is playing about near the middle of the  space. He is only a few weeks old, and not much bigger than the calf  of the ordinary cow. Watch and see how playful he is! He is just like  any other calf. His Mamma is grazing along quietly, and he is now  standing still for a minute, looking at nothing. A calf and a baby can  do that quite well--just stare, and yet look at nothing.    But now this buffalo calf rushes to his Mamma very suddenly, and has  a mouthful of milk. He does not seem to want more than a mouthful at a  time. So he looks up suddenly, and stares. Then just as suddenly he  plunges into a frantic race over the ground, all by himself.    The race also ends suddenly--after going only ten yards. Then he stops  there for a minute, stares, and trots back to his Mamma for another  mouthful of milk. After that he looks up again for a minute, stares at  nothing, and plunges into another mad gallop all by himself.    So you see that he spends his time doing two things--having a mouthful  of milk, and then a mad gallop. And he does both very suddenly. He  likes to have his joys suddenly.    A kitten or a puppy dog is different, and is nearly always doing  something. It tumbles head over heels, or chases its own tail, or  keeps frisking about in some way or other most of the time. But the  buffalo calf is not like this; and when you see him standing quite  still, staring at nothing, you can never tell whether he is going to  be hungry for a mouthful of milk the next minute, or whether he is  going to break into a frantic race.    But, you may ask, while he and all the other calves are playing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24855"],[0,"Concrete Construction: Methods and Costs (#7)"],[1,". The cost of shoveling divided by the number of cubic  yards shoveled is the cost of screening only when both the sand and the  coarser material are saved. Tests made in the pit will enable the  contractor to estimate how many cubic yards of gravel must be shoveled  to get a cubic yard of sand or pebbles. An energetic man will shovel  about 25 cu. yds. of gravel against a screen per 10-hour day and keep  the screened material cleared away, providing no carrying is necessary.    A mechanical arrangement capable of handling a considerably larger  yardage of material is shown by Fig. 8. Two men and a team are required.  The team is attached to the scraper by means of the rope passing through  the pulley at the top of the incline. The scraper is loaded in the usual  manner, hauled up the incline until its wheels are stopped by blocks and  then the team is backed up to slacken the rope and permit the scraper to  tip and dump its load. The trip holding the scraper while dumping is  operated from the ground. The scraper load falls onto an inclined  screen which takes out the sand and delivers the pebbles into the wagon.  By erecting bins to catch the sand and pebbles this same arrangement  could be made continuous in operation.    [Illustration: Fig. 8.--Device for Excavating and Screening Gravel and  Loading Wagons.]    [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Gravel Washing Plant of 120 to 130 Cu. Yds., Per  Hour Capacity.]    In commercial gravel mining, the gravel is usually sorted into several  sizes and generally it is washed as well as screened. Where the pebbles  run into larger sizes a crushing plant is also usually installed to  reduce the large stones. Works producing several hundred cubic yards of  screened and washed gravel per day require a plant of larger size and  greater cost than even a very large piece of concrete work will warrant,  so that only general mention will be made here of such plants. The  commercial sizes of gravel are usually 2-in., 1-in., ½-in. and ¼-in.,  down to sand. No very detailed costs of producing gravel by these  commercial plants are available. At the plant of the Lake Shore &  Michigan Southern Ry., where gravel is screened and washed for ballast,  the gravel is passed over a 2-in., a ¾-in., a ¼-in. and a 1/8-in. screen  in turn and the fine sand is saved. About 2,000 tons are handled per  day; the washed gravel, 2-in. to 1/8-in. sizes, represents from 40 to 65  per cent. of the raw gravel and costs from 23 to 30 cts. per cu. yd.,  for excavation, screening and washing. The drawings of Fig. 9 show a  gravel washing plant having a capacity of 120 to 130 cu. yds. per hour,  operated by the Stewart-Peck Sand Co., of Kansas City, Mo. Where washing  alone is necessary a plant of one or two washer units like those here  shown could be installed without excessive cost by a contractor at any  point where water is available. Each washer unit consists of two  hexagonal troughs 18 ins. in diameter and 18 ft. long. A shaft carrying  blades set spirally is rotated in each trough to agitate the gravel and  force it along; each trough also has a fall of 6 ins. toward its  receiving end. The two troughs are inclosed in a tank or box and above  and between them is a 5-in. pipe having ¾-in. holes 3 ins. apart so  arranged that the streams are directed into the troughs. The water and  dirt pass off at the lower end of the troughs while the gravel is fed by  the screws into a chute discharging into a bucket elevator, which in  turn feeds into a storage bin. The gravel to be washed runs from 2 ins.  to 1/8-in. in size; it is excavated by steam shovel and loaded into 1½  cu. yd. dump cars, three of which are hauled by a mule to the washers,  where the load is dumped into the troughs. The plant having a capacity  of 120 to 130 cu. yds. per hour cost $25,000, including pump and an  8-in. pipe line a mile long. A 100-hp. engine operates the plant, and 20  men are needed for all purposes. This plant produces washed gravel at a  profit for 40 cts. per cu. yd.          CHAPTER II.    THEORY AND PRACTICE OF PROPORTIONING CONCRETE.      American engineers proportion concrete mixtures by measure, thus a 1-3-5  concrete is one composed of 1 volume of cement, 3 volumes of sand and 5  volumes of aggregate. In Continental Europe concrete is commonly  proportioned by weight and there have been prominent advocates of this  practice among American engineers. It is not evident how such a change  in prevailing American practice would be of practical advantage. Aside  from the fact that it is seldom convenient to weigh the ingredients of  each batch, sand, stone and gravel are by no means constant in specific  gravity, so that the greater exactness of proportioning by weight is not  apparent. In this volume only incidental attention is given to  gravimetric methods of proportioning concrete.    ~VOIDS.~--Both the sand and the aggregates employed for concrete contain  voids. The amount of this void space depends upon a number of  conditions. As the task of proportioning concrete consists in so  proportioning the several materials that all void spaces are filled with  finer material the conditions influencing the proportion of voids in  sand and aggregates must be known.    ~Voids in Sand.~--The two conditions exerting the greatest influence on  the proportion of voids in sand are the presence of moisture and the  size of the grains of which the sand is composed.      TABLE I.--SHOWING EFFECT OF ADDITIONS OF DIFFERENT PERCENTAGES OF  MOISTURE ON VOLUME OF SAND.    Per cent of water in sand       0    0.5    1     2     3     5     10  Weight per cu. yd. of fine     Lbs.  Lbs.  Lbs.  Lbs.  Lbs.  Lbs.

A dry loose sand that has 45 per  cent. voids if mixed with 5 per cent. by weight of water will swell,  unless tamped, to such an extent that its voids may be 57 per cent. The  same sand if saturated with water until it becomes a thin paste may show  only 37½ per cent. voids after the sand has settled. Table I shows the  results of tests made by Feret, the French experimenter. Two kinds of  sand were used, a very fine sand and a coarse sand. They were measured  in a box that held 2 cu. ft. and was 8 ins. deep, the sand being  shoveled into the box but not tamped or shaken. After measuring and  weighing the dry sand 0.5 per cent. by weight of water was added and the  sand was mixed and shoveled back into the box again and then weighed.  These operations were repeated with varying percentages of water up to  10 per cent. It will be noted that the weight of mixed water and sand is  given; to ascertain the exact weight of dry sand in any mixture, divide  the weight given in the table by 100 per cent. plus the given tabular  per cent.; thus the weight of dry, fine sand in a 5 per cent. mixture is  2,035 ÷ 1.5 = 1,98 lbs. per cu. yd. The voids in the dry sand were 45  per cent. and in the sand with 5 per cent. moisture they were 56.7 per  cent. Pouring water onto loose, dry sand compacts it. By mixing fine  sand and water to a thin paste and allowing it to settle, it was found  that the sand occupied 11 per cent. less space than when measured dry.  The voids in fine sand, having a specific gravity of 2.65, were  determined by measurement in a quart measure and found to be as follows:    Sand not packed, per cent. voids                     44½  Sand shaken to refusal, per cent. voids              35  Sand saturated with water, per cent. voids           37½    Another series of tests made by Mr. H. P. Boardman, using Chicago sand  having 34 to 40 per cent. voids, showed the following results:    Water added, per cent.           2      4    6      8     10  Resulting per cent. increase    17.6   22   19.5   16.6   15.6    Mr. Wm. B. Fuller found by tests that a dry sand, having 34 per cent.  voids, shrunk 9.6 per cent. in volume upon thorough tamping until it had  27 per cent. voids. The same sand moistened with 6 per cent. water and  loose had 44 per cent. voids, which was reduced to 31 per cent. by  ramming. The same sand saturated with water had 33 per cent. voids and  by thorough ramming its volume was reduced 8½ per cent. until the sand  had only 26¼ per cent. voids. Further experiments might be quoted and  will be found recorded in several general treatises on concrete, but  these are enough to demonstrate conclusively that any theory of the  quantity of cement in mortar to be correct must take into account the  effect of moisture on the voids in sand.    The effect of the size and the shape of the component grains on the  amount of voids in sand is considerable. Feret's experiments are  conclusive on these points, and they alone will be followed here. Taking  for convenience three sizes of sand Feret mixed them in all the varying  proportions possible with a total of 10 parts; there were 66 mixtures.  The sizes used were: Large (L), sand composed of grains passing a  sieve of 5 meshes per linear inch and retained on a sieve of 15 meshes  per linear inch; medium (M>), sand passing a sieve of 15 meshes and  retained on a sieve of 50 meshes per linear inch, and fine (F), sand  passing a 50-mesh sieve. With a dry sand whose grains have a specific  gravity of 2.65, the weight of a cubic yard of either the fine, or the  medium, or the large size, was 2,190 lbs., which is equivalent to 51 per  cent. voids. The greatest weight of mixture, 2,840 lbs. per cu. yd., was  an L_{6}M_{0}F_{4} mixture, that is, one composed of six parts  large, no parts medium and 4 parts fine; this mixture was the densest of  the 66 mixtures made, having 36 per cent. voids. It will be noted that  the common opinion that the densest mixture is obtained by a mixture of  gradually"]]]
