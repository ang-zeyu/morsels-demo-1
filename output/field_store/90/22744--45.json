Russell Jennings'  patented auger bits (figs. 55-56) were cited for their \"workmanship and  quality,\" and, collectively, the Exhibition \"fully established the  reputation of American augers.\"[14] Likewise, makers of braces and bits  were commended for the number of excellent examples shown. Some were a  departure from the familiar design with \"an expansive chuck for the  bit,\" but others were simply elegant examples of the traditional brace,  in wood, japanned and heavily reinforced with highly polished brass  sidings. An example exhibited by E. Mills and Company, of Philadelphia,  received a certification from the judges as being \"of the best quality  and finish\" (fig. 57). The Mills brace, together with other  award-winning tools of the company--drawknives, screwdrivers, and  spokeshaves--is preserved in the collections of the Smithsonian  Institution (accession 319326). Today as a group they confirm \"the  remarkably fine quality of ... both iron and steel\" that characterized  the manufacture of American edge tools in the second half of the 19th  century.[15]    [Illustration: Figure 57.--1876: JAPANNED AND SPLINTED WITH HEAVY BRASS,  this brace was among the award-winning tools exhibited at the Centennial  by E. Mills and Company of Philadelphia. (Smithsonian photo 49792-D.)]    [Illustration: Figure 58.--1827: THE BENCH PLANES exhibited at  Philadelphia in 1876 were a radical departure from the traditional. In  1827 H. Knowles patented an iron-bodied bench plane that portended a  change in form that would witness a substitution of steel for wood in  all critical areas of the tool's construction, and easy adjustment of  the cutting edge by a setscrew, and an increased flexibility that  allowed one plane to be used for several purposes. (Wash drawing from  the restored patent drawings, August 24, 1827, U.S. Patent Office,  Record Group 241, the National Archives.)]    [Illustration: Figure 59.--1857: THE ADDITION OF METALLIC PARTS to  critical areas of wear as suggested by M.B. Tidey did not at first  radically alter the design of the bench plane. (Wash drawing from U.S.  Patent Office, March 24, 1857, Record Group 241, the National  Archives.)]    It is the plane, however, that best exemplifies the progress of tool  design. In 1876, American planemakers were enthusiastically credited  with having achieved \"an important change in the structure of the  tool.\"[16] Although change had been suggested by American patentees as  early as the 1820's, mass production lagged until after the Civil War,  and the use of this new tool form was not widespread outside of the  United States. Hazard Knowles of Colchester, Connecticut, in 1827,  patented a plane stock of cast iron which in many respects was a  prototype of later Centennial models (fig. 58).[17] It is evident, even  in its earliest manifestation, that the quest for improvement of the  bench plane did not alter its sound design. In 1857, M.B. Tidey (fig.  59) listed several of the goals that motivated planemakers:         First to simplify the manufacturing of planes; second to render       them more durable; third to retain a uniform mouth; fourth to       obviate their clogging; and fifth the retention of the essential       part of the plane when the stock is worn out.[18]    By far the greatest number of patents was concerned with perfecting an  adjustable plane iron and methods of constructing the sole of a plane so  that it would always be \"true.\" Obviously the use of metal rather than  the older medium, wood, was a natural step, but in the process of  changing from the wood to the iron-bodied bench plane there were many  transitional suggestions that combined both materials. Seth Howes of  South Chatham, Massachusetts, in U.S. patent 37,694, specified:         This invention relates to an improvement in that class of planes       which are commonly termed \"bench-planes,\" comprising the foreplane,       smoothing plane, jack plane, jointer, &c.         The invention consists in a novel and improved mode of adjusting       the plane-iron to regulate the depth of the cut of the same, in       connection with an adjustable cap, all being constructed and       arranged in such a manner that the plane-iron may be \"set\" with the       greatest facility and firmly retained in position by the adjustment       simply of the cap to the plane-iron, after the latter is set, and       the cap also rendered capable of being adjusted to compensate for       the wear of the \"sole\" or face of the plane stock.    The stock of Howes' plane was wood combined with metal plates, caps, and  screws. Thomas Worrall of Lowell was issued patent 17,657 for a plane  based on the same general principle (fig. 60). Worrall claimed in his  specifications of June 23, 1857:         the improved manufacture of [the] carpenter's bench plane or       jointer as made with its handle, its wooden stock to which said       handle is affixed, and a separate metallic cutter holder, and       cutter clamping devices arranged together substantially as       specified.    Finally patentees throughout the 19th century, faced with an increasing  proliferation of tool types, frequently sought to perfect multipurpose  implements of a type best represented later by the ubiquitous Stanley  plane. The evolution of the all-purpose idea, which is incidentally not  peculiar to hand tools alone, can be seen from random statements  selected from U.S. patents for the improvement of bench planes. In 1864  Stephen Williams in the specifications of his patent 43,360 stated:         I denominate my improvement the \"universal smoothing plane,\"       because it belongs to that variety of planes in which the face is       made changeable, so that it may be conveniently adapted to the       planing of curved as well as straight surfaces. By the use of my       improvement surfaces that are convex, concave, or straight may be       easily worked, the face of the tool being readily changed from one       form to another to suit the surface to which it is to be applied.    The announced object of Theodore Duval's improved grooving plane (pat.  97,177) was \"to produce in one tool all that is required to form grooves  of several different widths.\" None was more appealing than Daniel D.  Whitker's saw-rabbet plane (pat. 52,478) which combined \"an adjustable  saw with an adjustable fence or gage, both being attached to a stock  with handle similar to a plane, forming together a tool combining the  properties of the joiner's plow and fillister\" (fig. 61). Nor was  Whitker's idea simply a drawing-board exercise. It was produced  commercially and was well advertised, as seen in the circular reproduced  in figure 62.    [Illustration: Figure 60.--1857: IN A VARIETY OF ARRANGEMENTS, the  addition of metal plates, caps, and screws at the mouth of the plane, as  shown in Thomas Worrall's drawing, proved a transitional device that  preserved the ancient shape of the tool and slowed the introduction of  bench planes made entirely of iron. (Wash drawing from U.S. Patent  Office, June 23, 1857, Record Group 241, the National Archives.)]    [Illustration: Figure 61.--1865: NOT ALL MULTIPURPOSE INNOVATIONS  resulted from the use of new materials. Daniel D. Whitker patented a  combination saw and rabbet plane little different from one illustrated  by Andre-Jacob Roubo in his _L'Art du menuisier_ in 1769. (Wash drawing  from U.S. Patent Office, October 4, 1865, Record Group 241, the National  Archives.)]    In sum, these ideas produced a major break with the traditional shape of  the bench plane. William Foster in 1843 (pat. 3,355), Birdsill Holly in  1852 (pat. 9,094), and W.S. Loughborough in 1859 (pat. 23,928) are  particularly good examples of the radical departure from the wooden  block. And, in the period after the Civil War, C.G. Miller (discussed on  p. 213 and in fig. 63), B.A. Blandin (fig. 64), and Russell Phillips  (pat. 106,868) patented multipurpose metallic bench planes of excellent  design. It should be pointed out that the patentees mentioned above  represent only a few of the great number that tried to improve the  plane. Only the trend of change is suggested by the descriptions and  illustrations presented here. The cumulative effect awaited a showcase,  and the planemakers found it at the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 held  in Philadelphia.    [Illustration: Figure 62.--ABOUT 1865: THE PROGRESS OF AN IDEA from an  18th-century encyclopedia through an American patentee to commercial  reality can be seen in this flier advertising Whitker's saw-rabbet.  (Smithsonian Institution Library. Smithsonian photo 56629.)]    The impact of these new planes at the Exhibition caused some  retrospection among the judges:         The planes manufactured in Great Britain and in other countries       fifty years ago were formed of best beech-wood; the plane irons       were of steel and iron welded together; the jointer plane, about 21       inches long, was a bulky tool; the jack and hand planes were of the       same materials. Very little change has been made upon the plane in       Great Britain, unless in the superior workmanship and higher       quality of the plane iron.[19]    The solid wood-block plane, varying from country to country only in the  structure of its handles and body decoration, had preserved its  integrity of design since the Middle Ages. At the Centennial, however,  only a few examples of the old-type plane were exhibited. A new shape  dominated the cases. Designated by foreign observers as the American  plane, it received extended comment. Here was a tool         constructed with a skeleton iron body, having a curved wooden       handle; the plane iron is of the finest cast-steel; the cover is       fitted with an ingenious trigger at the top, which, with a screw       below the iron, admits of the plane iron being removed for       sharpening and setting without the aid of the hammer, and with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27250"],[0,"What I Saw in America (#7)"],[1," plumage of the seraphim; so long as he did not go near the  Tree of Knowledge.    In other words, if once he went to school it would be all up; and indeed  I fear in any case he would soon discover his error. If he stood wildly  waving his hat for liberty in the middle of the road as Chunk Chutney  picked itself out in ruby stars upon the sky, he would impede the  excellent but extremely rigid traffic system of New York. If he fell on  his knees before a sapphire splendour, and began saying an Ave Maria  under a mistaken association, he would be conducted kindly but firmly by  an Irish policeman to a more authentic shrine. But though the foreign  simplicity might not long survive in New York, it is quite a mistake to  suppose that such foreign simplicity cannot enter New York. He may be  excluded for being illiterate, but he cannot be excluded for being  ignorant, nor for being innocent. Least of all can he be excluded for  being wiser in his innocence than the world in its knowledge. There is  here indeed more than one distinction to be made. New York is a  cosmopolitan city; but it is not a city of cosmopolitans. Most of the  masses in New York have a nation, whether or no it be the nation to  which New York belongs. Those who are Americanised are American, and  very patriotically American. Those who are not thus nationalised are not  in the least internationalised. They simply continue to be themselves;  the Irish are Irish; the Jews are Jewish; and all sorts of other tribes  carry on the traditions of remote European valleys almost untouched. In  short, there is a sort of slender bridge between their old country and  their new, which they either cross or do not cross, but which they  seldom simply occupy. They are exiles or they are citizens; there is no  moment when they are cosmopolitans. But very often the exiles bring with  them not only rooted traditions, but rooted truths.    Indeed it is to a great extent the thought of these strange souls in  crude American garb that gives a meaning to the masquerade of New York.  In the hotel where I stayed the head waiter in one room was a Bohemian;  and I am glad to say that he called himself a Bohemian. I have already  protested sufficiently, before American audiences, against the pedantry  of perpetually talking about Czecho-Slovakia. I suggested to my American  friends that the abandonment of the word Bohemian in its historical  sense might well extend to its literary and figurative sense. We might  be expected to say, 'I'm afraid Henry has got into very Czecho-Slovakian  habits lately,' or 'Don't bother to dress; it's quite a Czecho-Slovakian  affair.' Anyhow my Bohemian would have nothing to do with such nonsense;  he called himself a son of Bohemia, and spoke as such in his criticisms  of America, which were both favourable and unfavourable. He was a squat  man, with a sturdy figure and a steady smile; and his eyes were like  dark pools in the depth of a darker forest, but I do not think he had  ever been deceived by the lights of Broadway.    But I found something like my real innocent abroad, my real peasant  among the sky-signs, in another part of the same establishment. He was a  much leaner man, equally dark, with a hook nose, hungry face, and fierce  black moustaches. He also was a waiter, and was in the costume of a  waiter, which is a smarter edition of the costume of a lecturer. As he  was serving me with clam chowder or some such thing, I fell into speech  with him and he told me he was a Bulgar. I said something like, 'I'm  afraid I don't know as much as I ought to about Bulgaria. I suppose most  of your people are agricultural, aren't they?' He did not stir an inch  from his regular attitude, but he slightly lowered his low voice and  said, 'Yes. From the earth we come and to the earth we return; when  people get away from that they are lost.'    To hear such a thing said by the waiter was alone an epoch in the life  of an unfortunate writer of fantastic novels. To see him clear away the  clam chowder like an automaton, and bring me more iced water like an  automaton or like nothing on earth except an American waiter (for piling  up ice is the cold passion of their lives), and all this after having  uttered something so dark and deep, so starkly incongruous and so  startlingly true, was an indescribable thing, but very like the picture  of the peasant admiring Broadway. So he passed, with his artificial  clothes and manners, lit up with all the ghastly artificial light of the  hotel, and all the ghastly artificial life of the city; and his heart  was like his own remote and rocky valley, where those unchanging words  were carved as on a rock.    I do not profess to discuss here at all adequately the question this  raises about the Americanisation of the Bulgar. It has many aspects, of  some of which most Englishmen and even some Americans are rather  unconscious. For one thing, a man with so rugged a loyalty to land could  not be Americanised in New York; but it is not so certain that he could  not be Americanised in America. We might almost say that a peasantry is  hidden in the heart of America. So far as our impressions go, it is a  secret. It is rather an open secret; covering only some thousand square  miles of open prairie. But for most of our countrymen it is something  invisible, unimagined, and unvisited; the simple truth that where all  those acres are there is agriculture, and where all that agriculture is  there is considerable tendency towards distributive or decently  equalised property, as in a peasantry. On the other hand, there are  those who say that the Bulgar will never be Americanised, that he only  comes to be a waiter in America that he may afford to return to be a  peasant in Bulgaria. I cannot decide this issue, and indeed I did not  introduce it to this end. I was led to it by a certain line of  reflection that runs along the Great White Way, and I will continue to  follow it. The criticism, if we could put it rightly, not only covers  more than New York but more than the whole New World. Any argument  against it is quite as valid against the largest and richest cities of  the Old World, against London or Liverpool or Frankfort or Belfast. But  it is in New York that we see the argument most clearly, because we see  the thing thus towering into its own turrets and breaking into its own  fireworks.    I disagree with the aesthetic condemnation of the modern city with its  sky-scrapers and sky-signs. I mean that which laments the loss of beauty  and its sacrifice to utility. It seems to me the very reverse of the  truth. Years ago, when people used to say the Salvation Army doubtless  had good intentions, but we must all deplore its methods, I pointed out  that the very contrary is the case. Its method, the method of drums and  democratic appeal, is that of the Franciscans or any other march of the  Church Militant. It was precisely its aims that were dubious, with their  dissenting morality and despotic finance. It is somewhat the same with  things like the sky-signs in Broadway. The aesthete must not ask me to  mingle my tears with his, because these things are merely useful and  ugly. For I am not specially inclined to think them ugly; but I am  strongly inclined to think them useless. As a matter of art for art's  sake, they seem to me rather artistic. As a form of practical social  work they seem to me stark stupid waste. If Mr. Bilge is rich enough to  build a tower four hundred feet high and give it a crown of golden  crescents and crimson stars, in order to draw attention to his  manufacture of the Paradise Tooth Paste or The Seventh Heaven Cigar, I  do not feel the least disposition to thank him for any serious form of  social service. I have never tried the Seventh Heaven Cigar; indeed a  premonition moves me towards the belief that I shall go down to the dust  without trying it. I have every reason to doubt whether it does any  particular good to those who smoke it, or any good to anybody except  those who sell it. In short Mr. Bilge's usefulness consists in being  useful to Mr. Bilge, and all the rest is illusion and sentimentalism.  But because I know that Bilge is only Bilge, shall I stoop to the  profanity of saying that fire is only fire? Shall I blaspheme crimson  stars any more than crimson sunsets, or deny that those moons are golden  any more than that this grass is green? If a child saw these coloured  lights, he would dance with as much delight as at any other coloured  toys; and it is the duty of every poet, and even of every critic, to  dance in respectful imitation of the child. Indeed I am in a mood of so  much sympathy with the fairy lights of this pantomime city, that I  should be almost sorry to see social sanity and a sense of proportion  return to extinguish them. I fear the day is breaking, and the broad  daylight of tradition and ancient truth is coming to end all this  delightful nightmare of New York at night. Peasants and priests and all  sorts of practical and sensible people are coming back into power, and  their stern realism may wither all these beautiful, unsubstantial,  useless things. They will not believe in the Seventh Heaven Cigar, even  when they see it shining as with stars in the seventh heaven. They will  not be affected by advertisements, any more than the priests and  peasants of the Middle Ages would have been affected by advertisements.  Only a very soft-headed, sentimental, and rather servile generation of  men could possibly be affected by advertisements at all. People who are  a little more hard-headed, humorous, and intellectually independent, see  the rather simple joke; and are not impressed by this or any other form  of self-praise. Almost any other men in almost any other age would have  seen the joke. If you had said to a man in the Stone Age, 'Ugg says Ugg  makes the best stone hatchets,' he would have perceived a lack of  detachment and disinterestedness "]]]
