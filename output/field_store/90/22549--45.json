At one moment it ran like the wind; the next it stopped  with such violence as to tear up the turf and scatter it around.  Then  it reared, almost falling back; anon it plunged and rushed on again,  with the foam flying from its mouth, and its bloodshot eyes glaring with  the fire of rage and terror, while the woods seemed to tremble with its  loud and deep-toned bellowing.  Twice in its passage across the open  glade it ran, in its blind fury, straight against a tree, almost beating  in its skull, and for a moment arresting its progress; but it instantly  recovered the shock and burst away again as madly as ever.  But no  effort that it was capable of making could relieve the poor creature  from its deadly burden, or cause the leopard in the slightest degree to  relax its fatal gripe.    It chanced that the wild bull's mad gallop was in a direction that  brought it within a few yards of the spot where we stood, so we prepared  to put an end to its misery.  As it drew near, Jack, who was in advance,  raised his rifle.  I, being only a short distance from him, also made  ready to fire, although I confess that in the agitation of the moment I  could not make up my mind whether I should fire at the buffalo or the  leopard.  As far as I can recall my rapid and disjointed thoughts on  that exciting occasion, I reasoned thus: \"If I shoot the leopard the  bull will escape, and if I shoot the bull the leopard will escape.\"  It  did not occur to me at that trying moment, when self-possession and  decision were so necessary, that I might shoot the bull with one barrel,  and the leopard with the other.  Still less did it occur to me that I  might miss bull and leopard altogether.    While I was engaged in this hurried train of troubled thought, Jack  fired both barrels of his rifle, one after the other, as quickly as  possible.  The bull stumbled forward upon its knees.  In order to make  assurance doubly sure, I aimed at its head and fired both barrels at  once.  Instantly the bull rose, with a hideous bellow, and stood for one  moment irresolute, glaring at its new enemies.  The leopard, I observed,  was no longer on its back.  At this moment I heard an exclamation of  anger, and looking round I observed Peterkin struggling violently in the  grasp of one of the wild vines or thorny plants which abound in some  parts of the African forests and render them almost impassable.  It  seems that as the bull drew near, Peterkin, who, like Jack and me, was  preparing to shoot, found that a dense thicket came between him and the  game, so as to prevent his firing.  He leaped nimbly over a bush,  intending to run to another spot, whence he could more conveniently take  aim, but found himself, as I have related, suddenly entangled among the  thorns in such a way that the more he struggled the more firmly he  became ensnared.  Being of an impatient disposition, he did struggle  violently, and it was this, probably, that attracted the attention of  the bull and decided its future course and its ultimate fate; for after  remaining one moment, as I have stated, in an irresolute attitude, it  turned suddenly to the left and rushed, with its head down and its tail  up, straight at Peterkin.    I cannot describe the sensations that overwhelmed me on observing the  imminent danger of my friend.  Horror almost overwhelmed me as I gazed  with a stare of fascination at the frightful brute, which with flashing  eyes and bloody foam dripping from its mouth charged into the thicket,  and crashed through the tough boughs and bushes as if they were grass.  A film came over my eyes.  I tried to reload my rifle, but my trembling  hand refused to act, and I groaned with mingled shame and despair on  finding myself thus incapable of action in the hour of extreme peril.  At that moment I felt I would joyfully have given my own life to have  saved that of Peterkin.  It takes me long to describe it, but the whole  scene passed with the rapidity almost of a flash of light.    Jack did not even attempt to load, but uttering a fearful cry, he sprang  towards our friend with a bound like that of an enraged tiger.  A gleam  of hope flashed through my soul as I beheld his gigantic form dash  through the underwood.  It seemed to me as if no living creature could  withstand such a furious onset.  Alas for Peterkin, had his life  depended on Jack, strong and lion-like though he was!  His aid could not  have been in time.  A higher Power nerved his arm and steeled his heart  at that terrible moment.  As I gazed helplessly at Peterkin, I observed  that he suddenly ceased his struggles to get free, and throwing forward  the muzzle of his piece, stood boldly up and awaited the onset with calm  self-possession.  The bull was on him almost in an instant.  One stride  more and he would have been lost, but that stride was never taken.  His  rifle poured its deadly charge into the skull of the wild bull, which  fell a mass of dead flesh, literally at his feet.    It were vain to attempt to describe the state of our feelings on this  memorable occasion--the fervour with which we thanked our heavenly  Father for our friend's deliverance--the delight with which we shook his  hands, again and again, and embraced him.  It was with considerable  difficulty that we extricated Peterkin from his entanglement.  When this  was accomplished we proceeded to examine our prize.    We were not a little puzzled on discovering that only three bullets had  struck the bull.  For my part, I fired straight at its forehead, and had  felt certain at the time that my shots had taken effect; yet there was  but one ball in the animal's head, and that was undoubtedly Peterkin's,  for the hair all round the hole was singed off, so near had it been to  him when he fired.  The other two shots were rather wide apart--one in  the shoulder, the other in the neck.  Both would have proved mortal in  the long run, but neither was sufficiently near to a vital spot to kill  speedily.    \"Now, Ralph, my boy,\" said Jack, after our excitement was in some degree  abated, \"you and I must divide the honour of these two shots, for I fear  we can't tell which of us fired them.  Peterkin only fired once, and  that was pretty effectual.\"    \"Yes,\" I replied, \"it is rather perplexing; for although I have no  objection whatever to your having all the honour of those two shots,  still one likes to know with certainty who actually made them.\"    \"You'd better toss for them,\" suggested Peterkin, who was seated on the  trunk of a fallen tree, examining, with a somewhat rueful countenance,  the tattered condition of his garments.    \"There would not be much satisfaction in that,\" replied Jack, laughing.    \"It is probable,\" said I, \"that each of us hit with one barrel and  missed with the other.\"    \"And it is possible,\" added Jack, \"that one of us hit with both, and the  other missed with both.  All that I can positively affirm is that I  fired both barrels at his shoulder--one after the other.\"    \"And all that I am certain of,\" said I, \"is that I fired both barrels at  his forehead, and that I discharged them both at once.\"    \"Did you?\" said Peterkin, looking up quickly; \"then, Ralph, I'm afraid  you must give all the honour to Jack, for you have missed altogether.\"    \"How do you know that?\"  I asked, in a somewhat piqued tone.    \"Simply enough.  If you fired both shots together at so short a  distance, they would have been found close together wherever they had  struck, whereas the two shots in the neck and shoulder are more than two  feet apart.\"    I was compelled to admit that there was much truth in the observation,  but still felt unwilling to give up all claim to having assisted in  slaying our first buffalo.  I pondered the subject a good deal during  the remainder of the time we spent in cutting up and packing part of the  buffalo meat, and in preparing to continue our journey, but could come  at no satisfactory conclusion in my own mind, and, to say truth, I felt  not a little crestfallen at my conduct in the whole affair.    While wandering in this mood near the spot where the buffalo had been  first wounded, I received a sudden and severe start on observing the  leopard crouching within a couple of yards of me.  I saw it through the  bushes quite distinctly, but could not make quite sure of its attitude.  With a mingled cry of alarm and astonishment I sprang back to the place  where I had left my rifle.    Jack and Peterkin instantly ran up with their pieces cocked.    \"Where is it?\" they cried in a breath.    \"There, crouching just behind that bush.\"    Jack darted forward.    \"Crouching!\" he cried, with a loud laugh, seizing the animal by the tail  and dragging it forth; \"why, it's dead--stone dead.\"    \"Dead as mutton,\" said Peterkin.  \"Hallo! what's this?\" he added in  surprise.  \"Two holes close together in its forehead, I do declare!  Hooray!  Ralph, my boy, give us your paw!  You've missed the bull and  hit the leopard!  If you haven't been and put two bullets right between  its two eyes, I'm a Dutchman!\"    And so, in truth, it turned out.  I had aimed at the bull and hit the  leopard.  So I left that spot not a little pleased with my bad aim and  my good fortune.        CHAPTER FOUR.    WHEREIN WILL BE FOUND MUCH THAT IS PHILOSOPHICAL.    Having skinned the leopard and cut off as much of the buffalo meat as we  could carry, we started for the negro village at a round pace, for we  had already lost much time in our last adventure.  As we walked along I  could not help meditating on the uncertainty of this life, and the  terrible suddenness with which we might at any unexpected moment be cut  off.  These thoughts led me naturally to reflect how important a matter  it is that every one, no matter how young, should be in a state of  preparedness to quit this world.    I also reflected, and not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2176"],[0,"Seven Discourses on Art (#7)"],[1,"individual form of that class, yet the highest perfection of the human  figure is not to be found in any one of them.  It is not in the Hercules,  nor in the gladiator, nor in the Apollo; but in that form which is taken  from them all, and which partakes equally of the activity of the  gladiator, of the delicacy of the Apollo, and of the muscular strength of  the Hercules.  For perfect beauty in any species must combine all the  characters which are beautiful in that species.  It cannot consist in any  one to the exclusion of the rest: no one, therefore, must be predominant,  that no one may be deficient.    The knowledge of these different characters, and the power of separating  and distinguishing them, is undoubtedly necessary to the painter, who is  to vary his compositions with figures of various forms and proportions,  though he is never to lose sight of the general idea of perfection in  each kind.    There is, likewise, a kind of symmetry or proportion, which may properly  be said to belong to deformity.  A figure lean or corpulent, tall or  short, though deviating from beauty, may still have a certain union of  the various parts, which may contribute to make them, on the whole, not  unpleasing.  When the artist has by diligent attention acquired a clear  and distinct idea of beauty and symmetry; when he has reduced the variety  of nature to the abstract idea; his next task will be to become  acquainted with the genuine habits of nature, as distinguished from those  of fashion.  For in the same manner, and on the same principles, as he  has acquired the knowledge of the real forms of nature, distinct from  accidental deformity, he must endeavour to separate simple chaste nature  from those adventitious, those affected and forced airs or actions, with  which she is loaded by modern education.    Perhaps I cannot better explain what I mean than by reminding you of what  was taught us by the Professor of Anatomy, in respect to the natural  position and movement of the feet.  He observed that the fashion of  turning, them outwards was contrary to the intent of nature, as might be  seen from the structure of the bones, and from the weakness that  proceeded from that manner of standing.  To this we may add the erect  position of the head, the projection of the chest, the walking with  straight knees, and many such actions, which are merely the result of  fashion, and what nature never warranted, as we are sure that we have  been taught them when children.    I have mentioned but a few of those instances, in which vanity or caprice  have contrived to distort and disfigure the human form; your own  recollection will add to these a thousand more of ill-understood methods,  that have been practised to disguise nature, among our dancing-masters,  hair-dressers, and tailors, in their various schools of deformity.    However the mechanic and ornamental arts may sacrifice to fashion, she  must be entirely excluded from the art of painting; the painter must  never mistake this capricious changeling for the genuine offspring of  nature; he must divest himself of all prejudices in favour of his age or  country; he must disregard all local and temporary ornaments, and look  only on those general habits that are everywhere and always the same.  He  addresses his works to the people of every country and every age; he  calls upon posterity to be his spectators, and says with Zeuxis, _In  aeternitatem pingo_.    The neglect of separating modern fashions from the habits of nature,  leads to that ridiculous style which has been practised by some painters  who have given to Grecian heroes the airs and graces practised in the  court of Louis XIV.; an absurdity almost as great as it would have been  to have dressed them after the fashion of that court.    To avoid this error, however, and to retain the true simplicity of  nature, is a task more difficult than at first sight it may appear.  The  prejudices in favour of the fashions and customs that we have been used  to, and which are justly called a second nature, make it too often  difficult to distinguish that which is natural from that which is the  result of education; they frequently even give a predilection in favour  of the artificial mode; and almost every one is apt to be guided by those  local prejudices who has not chastised his mind, and regulated the  instability of his affections, by the eternal invariable idea of nature.    Here, then, as before, we must have recourse to the ancients as  instructors.  It is from a careful study of their works that you will be  enabled to attain to the real simplicity of nature; they will suggest  many observations, which would probably escape you, if your study were  confined to nature alone.  And, indeed, I cannot help suspecting, that in  this instance the ancients had an easier task than the moderns.  They  had, probably, little or nothing to unlearn, as their manners were nearly  approaching to this desirable simplicity; while the modern artist, before  he can see the truth of things, is obliged to remove a veil, with which  the fashion of the times has thought proper to cover her.    Having gone thus far in our investigation of the great style in painting;  if we now should suppose that the artist has formed the true idea of  beauty, which enables him to give his works a correct and perfect design;  if we should suppose also that he has acquired a knowledge of the  unadulterated habits of nature, which gives him simplicity; the rest of  his talk is, perhaps, less than is generally imagined.  Beauty and  simplicity have so great a share in the composition of a great style,  that he who has acquired them has little else to learn.  It must not,  indeed, be forgot that there is a nobleness of conception, which goes  beyond anything in the mere exhibition, even of perfect form; there is an  art of animating and dignifying the figures with intellectual grandeur,  of impressing the appearance of philosophic wisdom or heroic virtue.  This  can only be acquired by him that enlarges the sphere of his understanding  by a variety of knowledge, and warms his imagination with the best  productions of ancient and modern poetry.    A hand thus exercised, and a mind thus instructed, will bring the art to  a higher degree of excellence than, perhaps, it has hitherto attained in  this country.  Such a student will disdain the humbler walks of painting,  which, however profitable, can never assure him a permanent reputation.  He will leave the meaner artist servilely to suppose that those are the  best pictures which are most likely to deceive the spectator.  He will  permit the lower painter, like the florist or collector of shells, to  exhibit the minute discriminations which distinguish one object of the  same species from another; while he, like the philosopher, will consider  nature in the abstract, and represent in every one of his figures the  character of its species.    If deceiving the eye were the only business of the art, there is no  doubt, indeed, but the minute painter would be more apt to succeed: but  it is not the eye, it is the mind, which the painter of genius desires to  address; nor will he waste a moment upon these smaller objects, which  only serve to catch the sense, to divide the attention, and to counteract  his great design of speaking to the heart.    This is the ambition I could wish to excite in your minds; and the object  I have had in my view, throughout this discourse, is that one great idea  which gives to painting its true dignity, that entitles it to the name of  a Liberal Art, and ranks it as a sister of poetry.    It may possibly have happened to many young students whose application  was sufficient to overcome all difficulties, and whose minds were capable  of embracing the most extensive views, that they have, by a wrong  direction originally given, spent their lives in the meaner walks of  painting, without ever knowing there was a nobler to pursue.  \"Albert  Durer,\" as Vasari has justly remarked, \"would probably have been one of  the first painters of his age (and he lived in an era of great artists)  had he been initiated into those great principles of the art which were  so well understood and practised by his contemporaries in Italy.  But  unluckily, having never seen or heard of any other manner, he considered  his own, without doubt, as perfect.\"    As for the various departments of painting, which do not presume to make  such high pretensions, they are many.  None of them are without their  merit, though none enter into competition with this great universal  presiding idea of the art.  The painters who have applied themselves more  particularly to low and vulgar characters, and who express with precision  the various shades of passion, as they are exhibited by vulgar minds  (such as we see in the works of Hogarth) deserve great praise; but as  their genius has been employed on low and confined subjects, the praise  that we give must be as limited as its object.  The merrymaking or  quarrelling of the Boors of Teniers; the same sort of productions of  Brouwer, or Ostade, are excellent in their kind; and the excellence and  its praise will be in proportion, as, in those limited subjects and  peculiar forms, they introduce more or less of the expression of those  passions, as they appear in general and more enlarged nature.  This  principle may be applied to the battle pieces of Bourgognone, the French  gallantries of Watteau, and even beyond the exhibition of animal life, to  the landscapes of Claude Lorraine, and the sea-views of Vandervelde.  All  these painters have, in general, the same right, in different degrees, to  the name of a painter, which a satirist, an epigrammatist, a sonnetteer,  a writer of pastorals, or descriptive poetry, has to that of a poet.    In the same rank, and, perhaps, of not so great merit, is the cold  painter of portraits.  But his correct and just imitation of "]]]
