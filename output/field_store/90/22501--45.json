Would you like to accompany  me?\"    It occurred to him at once that it would further his design to see Thais  in the games, and Paphnutius followed the stranger. In front of them  stood the theatre, its portico ornamented with shining masks, and its  huge circular wall covered with innumerable statues. Following the  crowd, they entered a narrow passage, at the end of which lay the  amphitheatre, glittering with light. They took their places on one of  the seats, which descended in steps to the stage, which was empty but  magnificently decorated. There was no curtain to hide the view, and on  the stage was a mound, such as used to be erected in old times to the  shades of heroes. This mound stood in the midst of a camp. Lances were  stacked in front of the tents, and golden shields hung from masts,  amidst boughs of laurel and wreaths of oak. On the stage all was  silence, but a murmur like the humming of bees in a hive rose from the  vast hemicycle filled with spectators. All their faces, reddened by the  reflection from the purple awning which waved above them, turned with  attentive curiosity towards the large, silent stage, with its tomb and  tents. The women laughed and ate lemons, and the regular theatre-goers  called gaily to one another from their seats.    Paphnutius prayed inwardly, and refrained from uttering any vain words,  but his neighbour began to complain of the decline of the drama.    \"Formerly,\" he said, \"clever actors used to declaim, under a mask, the  verses of Euripides and Menander. Now they no longer recite dramas, they  act in dumb show; and of the divine spectacles with which Bacchus  was honoured in Athens, we have kept nothing but what a barbarian--a  Scythian even--could understand--attitude and gesture. The tragic mask,  the mouth of which was provided with metal tongues that increased the  sound of the voice; the cothurnus, which raised the actors to the height  of gods; the tragic majesty and the splendid verses that used to be  sung, have all gone. Pantomimists, and dancing girls with bare faces,  have replaced Paulus and Roscius. What would the Athenians of the days  of Pericles have said if they had seen a woman on the stage? It is  indecent for a woman to appear in public. We must be very degenerate to  permit it. It is as certain as that my name is Dorion, that woman is the  natural enemy of man, and a disgrace to human kind.\"    \"You speak wisely,\" replied Paphnutius; \"woman is our worst enemy. She  gives us pleasure, and is to be feared on that account.\"    \"By the immovable gods,\" cried Dorion, \"it is not pleasure that woman  gives to man, but sadness, trouble, and black cares. Love is the cause  of our most biting evils. Listen, stranger. When I was a young man  I visited Troezene, in Argolis, and I saw there a myrtle of a most  prodigious size, the leaves of which were covered with innumerable  pinholes. And this is what the Troezenians say about that myrtle. Queen  Phaedra, when she was in love with Hippolytos, used to recline idly all  day long under this same tree. To beguile the tedium of her weary life  she used to draw out the golden pin which held her fair locks, and  pierce with it the leaves of the sweet-scented bush. All the leaves were  riddled with holes. After she had ruined the poor young man whom  she pursued with her incestuous love, Phaedra, as you know, perished  miserably. She locked herself up in her bridal chamber, and hanged  herself by her golden girdle from an ivory peg. The gods willed that the  myrtle, the witness of her bitter misery, should continue to bear, in  its fresh leaves, the marks of the pin-holes. I picked one of these  leaves, and placed it at the head of my bed, that by the sight of it  I might take warning against the folly of love, and conform to the  doctrine of the divine Epicurus, my master, who taught that all lust is  to be feared. But, properly speaking, love is a disease of the liver,  and one is never sure of not catching the malady.\"    Paphnutius asked--    \"Dorion, what are your pleasures?\"    Dorion replied sadly--    \"I have only one pleasure, and, it must be confessed, that it is not a  very exciting one; it is meditation. When a man has a bad digestion, he  must not look for any others.\"    Taking advantage of these words, Paphnutius proceeded to initiate the  Epicurean into those spiritual joys which the contemplation of God  procures. He began--    \"Hear the truth, Dorion, and receive the light.\"    But he saw then that all heads were turned towards him, and everybody  was making signs for him to be quiet. Dead silence prevailed in the  theatre, broken at last by the strains of heroic music.    The play began. The soldiers left their tents, and were preparing to  depart, when a prodigy occurred--a cloud covered the summit of the  funeral pile. Then the cloud rolled away, and the ghost of Achilles  appeared, clad in golden armour. Extending his arms towards the  warriors, he seemed to say to them, \"What! do you depart, children of  Danaos? do you return to the land I shall never behold again, and leave  my tomb without any offerings?\" Already the principal Greek chieftains  pressed to the foot of the pile. Acamas, the son of Theseus, old Nestor,  Agamemnon, bearing a sceptre and with a fillet on his brow, gazed at the  prodigy. Pyrrhus, the young son of Achilles, was prostrate in the dust.  Ulysses, recognisable by the cap which covered his curly hair, showed  by his gestures that he acquiesced in the demand of the hero's shade. He  argued with Agamemnon, and their words might be easily guessed--    \"Achilles,\" said the King of Ithaca, \"is worthy to be honoured by us,  for he died gloriously for Hellas. He demands that the daughter of  Priam, the virgin Polyxena, should be immolated on his tomb. Greeks!  appease the manes of the hero, and let the son of Peleus rejoice in  Hades.\"    But the king of kings replied--    \"Spare the Trojan virgins we have torn from the altars. Sufficient  misfortunes have already fallen on the illustrious race of Priam.\"    He spoke thus because he shared the couch of the sister of Polyxena, and  the wise Ulysses reproached him for preferring the couch of Cassandra to  the lance of Achilles.    The Greeks showed they shared the opinion of Ulysses, by loudly clashing  their weapons. The death of Polyxena was resolved on, and the appeased  shade of Achilles vanished. The music--sometimes wild and sometimes  plaintive--followed the thoughts of the personages in the drama. The  spectators burst into applause.    Paphnutius, who applied divine truth to everything murmured--    \"This fable shows how cruel the worshippers of false gods were.\"    \"All religions breed crimes,\" replied the Epicurean. \"Happily, a  Greek, who was divinely wise, has freed men from foolish terrors of the  unknown--\"    Just at that moment, Hecuba, her white hair dishevelled, her robe  tattered, came out of the tent in which she was kept captive. A long  sigh went up from the audience, when her woeful figure appeared. Hecuba  had been warned by a prophetic dream, and lamented her daughter's fate  and her own. Ulysses approached her, and asked her to give up Polyxena.  The old mother tore her hair, dug her nails into her cheeks, and kissed  the hands of the cruel chieftain, who, with unpitying calmness, seemed  to say--    \"Be wise, Hecuba, and yield to necessity. There are amongst us many old  mothers who weep for their children, now sleeping under the pines of  Ida.\"    And Hecuba, formerly queen of the most flourishing city in Asia, and now  a slave, bowed her unhappy head in the dust.    Then the curtain in front of one of the tents was raised, and the virgin  Polyxena appeared. A tremor passed through all the spectators. They had  recognised Thais. Paphnutius saw again the woman he had come to seek.  With her white arm she held above her head the heavy curtain. Motionless  as a splendid statue, she stood, with a look of pride and resignation  in her violet eyes, and her resplendent beauty made a shudder of  commiseration pass through all who beheld her.    A murmur of applause uprose, and Paphnutius, his soul agitated, and  pressing both hands to his heart, sighed--    \"Why, O my God, hast thou given this power to one of Thy creatures?\"    Dorion was not so disturbed. He said--    \"Certainly the atoms, which have momentarily met together to form this  woman, present a combination which is agreeable to the eye. But that is  but a freak of nature, and the atoms know not what they do. They will  some day separate with the same indifference as they came together.  Where are now the atoms which formed Lais or Cleopatra? I must confess  that women are sometimes beautiful. But they are liable to grievous  afflictions, and disgusting inconveniences. That is patent to all  thinking men, though the vulgar pay no attention to it. And women  inspire love, though it is absurd and ridiculous to love them.\"    Such were the thoughts of the philosopher and the ascetic as they  gazed on Thais. They neither of them noticed Hecuba, who turned to her  daughter, and seemed to say by her gestures--    \"Try to soften the cruel Ulysses. Employ your tears, your beauty, and  your youth.\"    Thais--or rather Polyxena herself--let fall the curtain of the tent. She  made a step forward, and all hearts were conquered. And when, with firm  but light steps, she advanced towards Ulysses, her rhythmic movements,  which were accompanied by the sound of flutes, created in all present  such happy visions, that it seemed as though she were the divine centre  of all the harmonies of the world. All eyes were bent on her; the other  actors were obscured by her effulgence, and were not noticed. The play  continued, however.    The prudent son of Laertes turned away his head, and hid his hand under  his mantle, in order to avoid the looks and kisses of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781"],[0,"Heidi (#7)"],[1,"morning, he would blow into his hands, he was so frozen. At last even  Peter could not come any more, for a deep snow had fallen over night.  Heidi stood at the window, watching the snow falling down. It kept on  snowing till it reached the windows; still it did not stop, and soon  the windows could not be opened, and they were all shut in. When it  had lasted for several days, Heidi thought that it would soon cover  up the cottage. It finally stopped, and the grandfather went out to  shovel the snow away from the door and windows, piling it up high here  and there. In the afternoon the two were sitting near the fire when  noisy steps were heard outside and the door was pushed open. It was  Peter, who had come up to see Heidi. Muttering, \"Good-evening,\" he  went up to the fire. His face was beaming, and Heidi had to laugh when  she saw little waterfalls trickling down from his person, for all the  ice and snow had melted in the great heat.    The grandfather now asked Peter how he got along in school. Heidi was  so interested that she asked him a hundred questions. Poor Peter, who  was not an easy talker, found himself in great difficulty answering  the little girl's inquiries, but at least it gave him leisure to dry  his clothes.    During this conversation the grandfather's eyes had been twinkling,  and at last he said to the boy: \"Now that you have been under fire,  general, you need some strengthening. Come and join us at supper.\"    With that the old man prepared a meal which amply satisfied Peter's  appetite. It had begun to get dark, and Peter knew that it was time to  go. He had said good-bye and thank you, when turning to Heidi he  remarked:    \"I'll come next Sunday, if I may. By the way, Heidi, grandmother asked  me to tell you that she would love to see you.\"    Heidi immediately approved of this idea, and her first word next  morning was: \"Grandfather, I must go down to grandmother. She is  expecting me.\"    Four days later the sun was shining and the tight-packed frozen snow  was crackling under every step. Heidi was sitting at the dinner-table,  imploring the old man to let her make the visit then, when he got up,  and fetching down her heavy cover, told her to follow him. They went  out into the glistening snow; no sound was heard and the snow-laden  fir-trees shone and glittered in the sun. Heidi in her transport was  running to and fro: \"Grandfather, come out! Oh, look at the trees!  They are all covered with silver and gold,\" she called to the  grandfather, who had just come out of his workshop with a wide sled.  Wrapping the child up in her cover, he put her on the sled, holding  her fast. Off they started at such a pace that Heidi shouted for joy,  for she seemed to be flying like a bird. The sled had stopped in front  of Peter's hut, and grandfather said: \"Go in. When it gets dark, start  on your way home.\" When he had unwrapped her, he turned homewards with  his sled.    [Illustration: OFF THEY STARTED AT SUCH A PACE THAT HEIDI SHOUTED FOR  JOY]    Opening the door, Heidi found herself in a tiny, dark kitchen, and  going through another door, she entered a narrow chamber. Near a table  a woman was seated, busy with mending Peter's coat, which Heidi had  recognized immediately. A bent old woman was sitting in a corner, and  Heidi, approaching her at once, said: \"How do you do, grandmother? I  have come now, and I hope I haven't kept you waiting too long!\"    Lifting her head, the grandmother sought for Heidi's hand. Feeling it  thoughtfully, she said: \"Are you the little girl who lives up with the  uncle? Is your name Heidi?\"    \"Yes,\" Heidi replied. \"The grandfather just brought me down in the  sled.\"    \"How is it possible? Your hands are as warm as toast! Brigida, did the  uncle really come down with the child?\"    Brigida, Peter's mother, had gotten up to look at the child. She said:  \"I don't know if he did, but I don't think so. She probably doesn't  know.\"    Heidi, looking up, said quite decidedly: \"I know that grandfather  wrapped me up in a cover when we coasted down together.\"    \"Peter was right after all,\" said the grandmother. \"We never thought  the child would live more than three weeks with him. Brigida, tell me  what she looks like.\"    \"She has Adelheid's fine limbs and black eyes, and curly hair like  Tobias and the old man. I think she looks like both of them.\"    While the women were talking, Heidi had been taking in everything.  Then she said: \"Grandmother, look at the shutter over there. It is  hanging loose. If grandfather were here, he would fasten it. It will  break the window-pane! Just look at it.\"    \"What a sweet child you are,\" said the grandmother tenderly. \"I can  hear it, but I cannot see it, child. This cottage rattles and creaks,  and when the wind blows, it comes in through every chink. Some day the  whole house will break to pieces and fall on top of us. If only Peter  knew how to mend it! We have no one else.\"    \"Why, grandmother, can't you see the shutter?\" asked Heidi.    \"Child, I cannot see anything,\" lamented the old woman.    \"Can you see it when I open the shutter to let in the light?\"    \"No, no, not even then. Nobody can ever show me the light again.\"    \"But you can see when you go out into the snow, where everything is  bright. Come with me, grandmother, I'll show you!\" and Heidi, taking  the old woman by the hand, tried to lead her out. Heidi was frightened  and got more anxious all the time.    \"Just let me stay here, child. Everything is dark for me, and my poor  eyes can neither see the snow nor the light.\"    \"But grandmother, does it not get light in the summer, when the sun  shines down on the mountains to say good-night, setting them all  aflame?\"    \"No, child, I can never see the fiery mountains any more. I have to  live in darkness, always.\"    Heidi burst out crying now and sobbed aloud. \"Can nobody make it light  for you? Is there nobody who can do it, grandmother? Nobody?\"    The grandmother tried all possible means to comfort the child; it  wrung her heart to see her terrible distress. It was awfully hard for  Heidi to stop crying when she had once begun, for she cried so seldom.  The grandmother said: \"Heidi, let me tell you something. People who  cannot see love to listen to friendly words. Sit down beside me and  tell me all about yourself. Talk to me about your grandfather, for it  has been long since I have heard anything about him. I used to know  him very well.\"    Heidi suddenly wiped away her tears, for she had had a cheering  thought. \"Grandmother, I shall tell grandfather about it, and I am  sure he can make it light for you. He can mend your little house and  stop the rattling.\"    The old woman remained silent, and Heidi, with the greatest vivacity,  began to describe her life with the grandfather. Listening  attentively, the two women would say to each other sometimes: \"Do you  hear what she says about the uncle? Did you listen?\"    Heidi's tale was interrupted suddenly by a great thumping on the door;  and who should come in but Peter. No sooner had he seen Heidi, than he  smiled, opening his round eyes as wide as possible. Heidi called,  \"Good-evening, Peter!\"    \"Is it really time for him to come home!\" exclaimed Peter's  grandmother. \"How quickly the time has flown. Good-evening, little  Peter; how is your reading going?\"    \"Just the same,\" the boy replied.    \"Oh, dear, I was hoping for a change at last. You are nearly twelve  years old, my boy.\"    \"Why should there be a change?\" inquired Heidi with greatest interest.    \"I am afraid he'll never learn it after all. On the shelf over there  is an old prayer-book with beautiful songs. I have forgotten them all,  for I do not hear them any more. I longed that Peter should read them  to me some day, but he will never be able to!\"    Peter's mother got up from her work now, saying, \"I must make a light.  The afternoon has passed and now it's getting dark.\"    When Heidi heard those words, she started, and holding out her hand to  all, she said: \"Good-night. I have to go, for it is getting dark.\" But  the anxious grandmother called out: \"Wait, child, don't go up alone!  Go with her, Peter, and take care that she does not fall. Don't let  her get cold, do you hear? Has Heidi a shawl?\"    \"I haven't, but I won't be cold,\" Heidi called back, for she had  already escaped through the door. She ran so fast that Peter could  hardly follow her. The old woman frettingly called out: \"Brigida, run  after her. Get a warm shawl, she'll freeze in this cold night. Hurry  up!\" Brigida obeyed. The children had hardly climbed any distance,  when they saw the old man coming and with a few vigorous steps he  stood beside them.    \"I am glad you kept your word, Heidi,\" he said; and packing her into  her cover, he started up the hill, carrying the child in his arms.  Brigida had come in time to see it, and told the grandmother what she  had witnessed.    \"Thank God, thank God!\" the old woman said. \"I hope she'll come again;  she has done me so much good! What a soft heart she has, the darling,  and how nicely she can talk.\" All evening the grandmother said to  herself, \"If only he lets her come again! I have something to look  forward to in this world now, thank God!\"    Heidi could hardly wait before they reached the cottage. She had tried  to talk on the way, but no sound could be heard through the heavy  cover. As soon as they were inside the hut she began: \"Grandfather, we  must take some nails and a hammer down tomorrow; a shutter is loose in  grandmother's house and many other places shake. Everything rattles in  her house.\"    \"Is that so? Who says we must?\"    \"Nobody told me, but I know,\" Heidi replied. \"Everything is loose in  the house, and poor grandmother told me she was afraid that the house  might tumble down. And grandfather, she cannot see the light. Can you  help her and make it light for her? How terrible it must be to be  afraid in the dark and nobody"]]]
