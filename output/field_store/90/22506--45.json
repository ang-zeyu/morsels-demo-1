What products were left in the  flask, and how much of each was present?          CHAPTER III    HYDROGEN      ~Historical.~ The element hydrogen was first clearly recognized as a  distinct substance by the English investigator Cavendish, who in 1766  obtained it in a pure state, and showed it to be different from the  other inflammable airs or gases which had long been known. Lavoisier  gave it the name hydrogen, signifying water former, since it had been  found to be a constituent of water.    ~Occurrence.~ In the free state hydrogen is found in the atmosphere, but  only in traces. In the combined state it is widely distributed, being a  constituent of water as well as of all living organisms, and the  products derived from them, such as starch and sugar. About 10% of the  human body is hydrogen. Combined with carbon, it forms the substances  which constitute petroleum and natural gas.         It is an interesting fact that while hydrogen in the free state       occurs only in traces on the earth, it occurs in enormous       quantities in the gaseous matter surrounding the sun and       certain other stars.    ~Preparation from water.~ Hydrogen can be prepared from water by several  methods, the most important of which are the following.    1. _By the electric current._ As has been indicated in the preparation  of oxygen, water is easily separated into its constituents, hydrogen and  oxygen, by passing an electric current through it under certain  conditions.    2. _By the action of certain metals._ When brought into contact with  certain metals under appropriate conditions, water gives up a portion  or the whole of its hydrogen, its place being taken by the metal. In the  case of a few of the metals this change occurs at ordinary temperatures.  Thus, if a bit of sodium is thrown on water, an action is seen to take  place at once, sufficient heat being generated to melt the sodium, which  runs about on the surface of the water. The change which takes place  consists in the displacement of one half of the hydrogen of the water by  the sodium, and may be represented as follows:              _        _            _        _           | hydrogen |          | sodium   |  sodium + | hydrogen |(water) = | hydrogen |(sodium hydroxide) + hydrogen           |_oxygen  _|          |_oxygen  _|    The sodium hydroxide formed is a white solid which remains dissolved in  the undecomposed water, and may be obtained by evaporating the solution  to dryness. The hydrogen is evolved as a gas and may be collected by  suitable apparatus.    Other metals, such as magnesium and iron, decompose water rapidly, but  only at higher temperatures. When steam is passed over hot iron, for  example, the iron combines with the oxygen of the steam, thus displacing  the hydrogen. Experiments show that the change may be represented as  follows:            _        _         | hydrogen |           _       _                 _        _  iron + | hydrogen |(water) = | iron    |(iron oxide) + | hydrogen |         |_oxygen  _|          |_oxygen _|               |_hydrogen_|    The iron oxide formed is a reddish-black compound, identical with that  obtained by the combustion of iron in oxygen.         ~Directions for preparing hydrogen by the action of steam on       iron.~ The apparatus used in the preparation of hydrogen from       iron and steam is shown in Fig. 9. A porcelain or iron tube       B, about 50 cm. in length and 2 cm. or 3 cm. in diameter, is       partially filled with fine iron wire or tacks and connected as       shown in the figure. The tube B is heated, slowly at first,       until the iron is red-hot. Steam is then conducted through the       tube by boiling the water in the flask A. The hot iron       combines with the oxygen in the steam, setting free the       hydrogen, which is collected over water. The gas which first       passes over is mixed with the air previously contained in the       flask and tube, and is allowed to escape, _since a mixture of       hydrogen with oxygen or air explodes violently when brought in       contact with a flame_. It is evident that the flask A must be       disconnected from the tube before the heat is withdrawn.         That the gas obtained is different from air and oxygen may be       shown by holding a bottle of it mouth downward and bringing a       lighted splint into it. The hydrogen is ignited and burns with       an almost colorless flame.    [Illustration Fig. 9]    ~Preparation from acids~ (_usual laboratory method_). While hydrogen can  be prepared from water, either by the action of the electric current or  by the action of certain metals, these methods are not economical and  are therefore but little used. In the laboratory hydrogen is generally  prepared from compounds known as acids, all of which contain hydrogen.  When acids are brought in contact with certain metals, the metals  dissolve and set free the hydrogen of the acid. Although this reaction  is a quite general one, it has been found most convenient in preparing  hydrogen by this method to use either zinc or iron as the metal and  either hydrochloric or sulphuric acid as the acid. Hydrochloric acid is  a compound consisting of 2.77% hydrogen and 97.23% chlorine, while  sulphuric acid consists of 2.05% hydrogen, 32.70% sulphur, and 65.25%  oxygen.    The changes which take place in the preparation of hydrogen from zinc  and sulphuric acid (diluted with water) may be represented as follows:            _        _               _       _         | hydrogen |(sulphuric   | zinc    |(zinc  zinc + | sulphur  | acid)     = | sulphur | sulphate) + hydrogen         |_oxygen  _|             |_oxygen _|    In other words, the zinc has taken the place of the hydrogen in  sulphuric acid. The resulting compound contains zinc, sulphur, and  oxygen, and is known as zinc sulphate. This remains dissolved in the  water present in the acid. It may be obtained in the form of a white  solid by evaporating the liquid left after the metal has passed into  solution.    When zinc and hydrochloric acid are used the following changes take  place:            _        _                  _        _         | hydrogen |(hydrochloric   | zinc     |(zinc  zinc + |_chlorine_| acid)        = |_chlorine_| chloride) + hydrogen    When iron is used the changes which take place are exactly similar to  those just given for zinc.    [Illustration Fig. 10.]         ~Directions for preparing hydrogen from acids.~ The preparation       of hydrogen from acids is carried out in the laboratory as       follows: The metal is placed in a flask or wide-mouthed bottle       A (Fig. 10) and the acid is added slowly through the funnel       tube B. The metal dissolves in the acid, while the hydrogen       which is liberated escapes through the exit tube C and is       collected over water. It is evident that the hydrogen which       passes over first is mixed with the air from the bottle A.       Hence care must be taken not to bring a flame near the exit       tube, since, as has been stated previously, such a mixture       explodes with great violence when brought in contact with a       flame.         ~Precautions.~ Both sulphuric acid and zinc, if impure, are       likely to contain small amounts of arsenic. Such materials       should not be used in preparing hydrogen, since the arsenic       present combines with a portion of the hydrogen to form a very       poisonous gas known as arsine. On the other hand, chemically       pure sulphuric acid, i.e. sulphuric acid that is entirely free       from impurities, will not act upon chemically pure zinc. The       reaction may be started, however, by the addition of a few       drops of a solution of copper sulphate or platinum       tetrachloride.    ~Physical properties.~ Hydrogen is similar to oxygen in that it is a  colorless, tasteless, odorless gas. It is characterized by its extreme  lightness, being the lightest of all known substances. One liter of the  gas weighs only 0.08984 g. On comparing this weight with that of an  equal volume of oxygen, viz., 1.4285 g., the latter is found to be 15.88  times as heavy as hydrogen. Similarly, air is found to be 14.38 times as  heavy as hydrogen. Soap bubbles blown with hydrogen rapidly rise in the  air. On account of its lightness it is possible to pour it upward from  one bottle into another. Thus, if the bottle A (Fig. 11) is filled  with hydrogen, placed mouth downward by the side of bottle _B_, filled  with air, and is then gradually inverted under B as indicated in the  figure, the hydrogen will flow upward into bottle _B_, displacing the  air. Its presence in bottle B may then be shown by bringing a lighted  splint to the mouth of the bottle, when the hydrogen will be ignited by  the flame. It is evident, from this experiment, that in order to retain  the gas in an open bottle the bottle must be placed mouth downward.    [Illustration Fig. 11]    Hydrogen is far more difficult to liquefy than any other gas, with the  exception of helium, a rare element recently found to exist in the  atmosphere. The English scientist Dewar, however, in 1898 succeeded not  only in obtaining hydrogen in liquid state but also as a solid. Liquid  hydrogen is colorless and has a density of only 0.07. Its boiling point  under atmospheric pressure is -252 deg.. Under diminished pressure the  temperature has been reduced to -262 deg.. The solubility of hydrogen in  water is very slight,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20851"],[0,"Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 3 (#7)"],[1,"les pens['e]es dont son [^a]me est       remplie, et cherche sans cesse [`a] resoudre les antith[`e]ses.--G.

The  first mayor of this village was elected towards the close of the  eighteenth century, and the election came about thus: Garratt Common had  often been encroached on, and in 1780 the inhabitants associated  themselves together to defend their rights. The chairman was called  _Mayor_, and as it happened to be the time of a general election, the  society made it a law that a new \"mayor\" should be elected at every  general election. The addresses of these mayors, written by Foote,  Garrick, Wilks, and others, are satires and political squibs. The first  mayor of Garratt was \"Sir\" John Harper, a retailer of brickdust; and the  last was \"Sir\" Harry Dimsdale, a muffin-seller (1796). In Foote's farce  so called, Jerry Sneak is chosen mayor, son-in-law of the landlord  (1763).      =Mayors= (_Lord_) who have founded noble houses:                                                               _Lord Mayor._    AVELAND (_Lord_), from Sir Gilbert Heathcote                  1711    BACON (_Lord_), from Sir Thomas Cooke, draper                 1557    BATH (_Marquis of_), from Sir Rowland Heyward, cloth-worker   1570    BRAYBROOKE (_Lord_), from Sir John Gresham, grocer            1547    BROOK (_Lord_), from Sir Samuel Dashwood, vintner             1702    BUCKINGHAM (_Duke of_), from Sir John Gresham, grocer         1547    COMPTON (_Lord_), from Sir Wolston Dixie, skinner             1585    CRANBOURNE (_Viscount_), from Sir Christopher Gascoigne       1753    DENBIGH (_Earl of_), from Sir Godfrey Fielding, mercer        1452    DONNE (_Viscount_), from Sir Gilbert Heathcote                1711    FITZWILLIAM (_Earl of_), from Sir Thomas Cooke, draper        1557    PALMERSTON (_Lord_), from Sir John Houblon, grocer            1695    SALISBURY (_Marquis of_), from Sir Thomas Cooke, draper       1557    WARWICK (_Earl of_), from Sir Samuel Dashwood, vintner        1702    WILTSHIRE (_Earl of_), from Sir Godfrey Boleine               1457      (queen Elizabeth was his granddaughter).      =Maypole= (_The_), the nickname given to Erangard Melousine de  Schulemberg, duchess of Kendal, the mistress of George I., on account of  her leanness and height (1719, died, 1743).      =Mazarin of Letters= (_The_), D'Alembert (1717-1783).      =Mazarine= (_A_), a common council-man of London; so called from the  mazarine-blue silk gown worn by this civil functionary.      =Mazeppa= (_Jan_), a hetman of the Cossacks, born of a noble Polish family  in Podolia. He was a page in the court of Jan Casimir, king of Poland,  and while in this capacity intrigued with Theresia, the young wife of a  Podolian count, who discovered the amour, and had the young page lashed  to a wild horse, and turned adrift. The horse rushed in mad fury, and  dropped down dead in the Ukraine, where Mazeppa was released by a  Cossack, who nursed him carefully in his own hut. In time the young page  became a prince of the Ukraine, but fought against Russia in the battle  of Pultowa. Lord Byron (1819) makes Mazeppa tell his tale to Charles  XII. after the battle (1640-1709).         \"Muster Richardson\" had a fine appreciation of genius, and left the       original \"Mazeppa\" at Astley's a handsome legacy [1766-1836].--Mark       Lemon.      =M.

So the duke deputed Angelo to enforce it, and, assuming the  dress of a friar, absented himself awhile, to watch the result. Scarcely  was the duke gone, when Claudio was sentenced to death for violating  the law. His sister Isabel went to intercede on his behalf, and Angelo  told her he would spare her brother if she would give herself to him.  Isabel told her brother he must prepare to die, as the conditions  proposed by Angelo were out of the question. The duke, disguised as a  friar, heard the whole story, and persuaded Isabel to \"assent in words,\"  but to send Mariana (the divorced wife of Angelo), to take her place.  This was done; but Angelo sent the provost to behead Claudio, a crime  which \"the friar\" contrived to avert. Next day, the duke returned to the  city, and Isabel told her tale. The end was, the duke married Isabel,  Angelo took back his wife, and Claudio married Juliet, whom he had  seduced.--Shakespeare, _Measure for Measure_ (1603).
