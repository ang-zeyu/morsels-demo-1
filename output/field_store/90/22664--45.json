They sailed into the main when they had a fair wind, and made Orkney a  little before the winter. Earl Sigurd Lodverson was still lord over the  isles, and Gunnlaug went to him and abode there that winter, and the  earl held him of much account.    In the spring the earl would go on warfare, and Gunnlaug made ready to  go with him; and that summer they harried wide about the South-isles  and Scotland's firths, and had many fights, and Gunnlaug always showed  himself the bravest and doughtiest of fellows, and the hardiest of men  wherever they came.    Earl Sigurd went back home early in the summer, but Gurmlaug took ship  with chapmen, sailing for Norway, and he and Earl Sigurd parted in great  friendship.    Gunnlaug fared north to Thrandheim, to Hladir, to see Earl Eric, and  dwelt there through the early winter; the earl welcomed him gladly, and  made offer to Gunnlaug to stay with him, and Gunnlaug agreed thereto.    The earl had heard already how all had befallen between Gunnlaug and  Raven, and he told Gunnlaug that he laid ban on their fighting within  his realm; Gunnlaug said the earl should be free to have his will  herein.    So Gunnlaug abode there the winter through, ever heavy of mood.          CHAPTER XVI.     How the two Foes met and fought at Dingness.    But on a day in spring Gunnlaug was walking abroad, and his kinsman  Thorkel with him; they walked away from the town, till on the meads.  before them they saw a ring of men, and in that ring were two men with  weapons fencing; but one was named Raven, the other Gunnlaug, while they  who stood by said that Icelanders smote light, and were slow to remember  their words.    Gunnlaug saw the great mocking hereunder, and much jeering was brought  into the play; and withal he went away silent.    So a little while after he said to the earl that he had no mind to bear  any longer the jeers and mocks of his courtiers about his dealings with  Raven, and therewith he prayed the earl to give him a guide to Lifangr:  now before this the earl had been told that Raven had left Lifangr and  gone east to Sweden; therefore, he granted Gunnlaug leave to go, and  gave him two guides for the journey.    Now Gunnlaug went from Hladir with six men to Lifangr; and, on the  morning of the very day whereas Gunnlaug came in in the evening, Raven  had left Lifangr with four men. Thence Gunnlaug went to Vera-dale, and  came always in the evening to where Raven had been the night before.    So Gunnlaug went on till he came to the uppermost farm in the valley,  called Sula, wherefrom had Raven fared in the morning; there he stayed  not his journey, but kept on his way through the night.    Then in the morning at sun-rise they saw one another. Raven had got to  a place where were two waters, and between them flat meads, and they  are called Gleipni's meads: but into one water stretched a little ness  called Dingness. There on the ness Raven and his fellows, five together,  took their stand. With Raven were his kinsmen, Grim and Olaf.    Now when they met, Gunnlaug said, \"It is well that we have found one  another.\"    Raven said that he had nought to quarrel with therein;    \"But now,\" says he, \"thou mayest choose as thou wilt, either that we  fight alone together, or that we fight all of us man to man.\"    Gunnlaug said that either way seemed good to him.    Then spake Raven's kinsmen, Grim and Olaf, and said that they would  little like to stand by and look on the fight, and in like wise spake  Thorkel the Black, the kinsman of Gunnlaug.    Then said Gunnlaug to the earl's guides, \"Ye shall sit by and aid  neither side, and be here to tell of our meeting;\" and so they did.    So they set on, and fought dauntlessly, all of them. Grim and Olaf went  both against Gunnlaug alone, and so closed their dealings with him that  Gunnlaug slew them both and got no wound. This proves Thord Kolbeinson  in a song that he made on Gunnlaug the Wormtongue:--              \"Grim and Olaf great-hearts            In Gondul's din, with thin sword            First did Gunnlaug fell there            Ere at Raven fared he;            Bold, with blood be-drifted            Bane of three the thane was;            War-lord of the wave-horse            Wrought for men folks' slaughter.\"    Meanwhile Raven and Thorkel the Black, Gunnlaug's kinsman, fought until  Thorkel fell before Raven and lost his life; and so at last all their  fellowship fell. Then they two alone fought together with fierce  onsets and mighty strokes, which they dealt each the other, falling on  furiously without stop or stay.    Gunnlaug had the sword Ethelred's-gift, and that was the best of  weapons. At last Gunnlaug dealt a mighty blow at Raven, and cut his leg  from under him; but none the more did Raven fall, but swung round up to  a tree-stem, whereat he steadied the stump.    Then said Gunnlaug, \"Now thou art no more meet for battle, nor will I  fight with thee any longer, a maimed man.\"    Raven answered: \"So it is,\" said he, \"that my lot is now all the worser  lot, but it were well with me yet, might I but drink somewhat.\"    Gunnlaug said, \"Bewray me not if I bring thee water in my helm.\"    \"I will not bewray thee,\" said Raven. Then went Gunnlaug to a brook and  fetched water in his helm, and brought it to Raven; but Raven stretched  forth his left hand to take it, but with his right hand drave his sword  into Gunnlaug's head, and that was a mighty great wound.    Then Gunnlaug said, \"Evilly hast thou beguiled me, and done traitorously  wherein I trusted thee.\"    Raven answers, \"Thou sayest sooth, but this brought me to it, that I  begrudged thee to lie in the bosom of Helga the Fair.\"    Thereat they fought on, recking of nought; but the end of it was that  Gunnlaug overcame Raven, and there Raven lost his life..    Then the earl's guides came forward and bound the head-wound of  Gunnlaug, and in meanwhile, he sat and sang:--              \"O thou sword-storm stirrer,            Raven, stem of battle            Famous, fared against me            Fiercely in the spear din.            Many a flight of metal            Was borne on me this morning,            By the spear-walls' builder,            Ring-bearer, on hard Dingness.\"    After that they buried the dead, and got Gunnlaug on to his horse  thereafter, and brought him right down to Lifangr. There he lay three  nights, and got all his rights of a priest, and died thereafter, and was  buried at the church there.    All men thought it great scathe of both of these men, Gunnlaug and  Raven, amid such deeds as they died.          CHAPTER XVII.     The News of the Fight brought to Iceland.    Now this summer, before these tidings were brought out hither to  Iceland, Illugi the Black, being at home at Gilsbank, dreamed a dream:  he thought that Gunnlaug came to him in his sleep, all bloody, and he  sang in the dream this stave before him; and Illugi remembered the song  when he woke, and sang it before others:--              \"Knew I of the hewing            Of Raven's hilt-finned steel-fish            Byrny-shearing--sword-edge            Sharp clave leg of Raven.--            Of warm wounds drank the eagle,            When the war-rod slender,            Cleaver of the corpses,            Clave the head of Gunnlaug.\"    This portent befel south at Mossfell, the self-same night, that Onund  dreamed how Raven came to him, covered all over with blood, and sang:--              \"Red is the sword, but I now            Am undone by Sword-Odin.            'Gainst shields beyond the sea-flood            The ruin of shields was wielded.            Methinks the blood-fowl blood-stained            In blood der men's heads stood there,            The wound-erne yet wound-eager            Trod over wounded bodies?\"    Now the second summer after this, Illugi the Black spoke at the Althing  from the Hill of Laws, and said:--    \"Wherewith wilt thou make atonement to me for my son, whom Raven, thy  son, beguiled in his troth?\"    Onund answers, \"Be it far from me to atone for him, so sorely as their  meeting hath wounded me. Yet will I not ask atonement of thee for my  son.\"    \"Then shall my wrath come home to some of thy kin,\" says Illugi. And  withal after the Thing was Illugi at most times very sad.    Tells the tale how this autumn Illugi rode from Gilsbank with thirty  men, and came to Mossfell early in the morning. Then Onund got into the  church with his sons, and took sanctuary; but Illugi caught two of his  kin, one called Biorn and the other Thorgrim, and had Biorn slain, but  the feet smitten from Thorgrim. And thereafter Illugi rode home, and  there was no righting of this for Onund.    Hermund, Illugi's son, had little joy after the death of Gunnlaug his  brother, and deemed he was none the more avenged even though this had  been wrought.    Now there was a man called Raven, brother's son to Onund of Mossfell;  he was a great sea-farer, and had a ship that lay up in Ramfirth: and in  the spring Hermund Illugison rode from home alone north over Holt-beacon  Heath, even to Ramfirth, and out as far as Board-ere to the ship of  the chapmen. The chapmen were then nearly ready for sea; Raven, the  ship-master, was on shore, and many men with him; Hermund rode up to  him, and thrust him through with his spear, and rode away forthwith: but  all Raven's men were bewildered at seeing Hermund.    No atonement came for this slaying, and therewith ended the dealings of  Illugi the Black and Onund of Mossfell.          CHAPTER XVIII.     The Death of Helga the Fair.    AS time went on, Thorstein Egilson married his daughter Helga to a man  called Thorkel, son of Hallkel, who lived west in Hraundale. Helga went  to his house with him, but loved him little, for she cannot cease to  think of Gunnlaug, though he be dead. Yet was Thorkel a doughty man, and  wealthy of goods, and a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2443"],[0,"The Story of the Mormons, from the Date of Their Origin to the Year 1901 (#7)"],[1,"ts,\" where she  saw the Saviour and received a message from Him for her earthly friends.         * A sect called \"Seekers,\" who arose in 1645, taught, like the  Mormons, that the Scriptures are defective, the true church lost, and  miracles necessary to faith.      Lucy herself came very exactly under the description given by Ruth  McEnery Stuart of one of her negro characters: \"Duke's mother was of the  slighter intelligences, and hence much given to convictions. Knowing  few things, she 'believed in' a great many.\" Lucy Smith had neither  education nor natural intelligence that would interfere with such  \"beliefs\" as came to her from family tradition, from her own literal  interpretations of the Bible, or from the workings of her imagination.  She tells us that after her marriage, when very ill, she made a covenant  with God that she would serve him if her recovery was granted; thereupon  she heard a voice giving her assurance that her prayer would be  answered, and she was better the next morning. Later, when anxious for  the safety of her husband's soul, she prayed in a grove (most of  the early Mormons' prayers were made in the woods), and saw a vision  indicating his coming conversion; later still, in Vermont, a daughter  was restored to health by her parent's prayers.    According to Mrs. Smith's account of their life in Vermont, they were  married on January 24, 1796, at Tunbridge, but soon moved to Randolph,  where Smith was engaged in \"merchandise,\" keeping a store. Learning of  the demand for crystallized ginseng in China, he invested money in that  product and made a shipment, but it proved unprofitable, and, having in  this way lost most of his money, they moved back to a farm at Tunbridge.  Thence they moved to Royalton, and in a few months to Sharon, where,  on December 23, 1805, Joseph Smith, Jr., their fourth child, was born.*  Again they moved to Tunbridge, and then back to Royalton (all these  places in Vermont). From there they went to Lebanon, New Hampshire,  thence to Norwich, Vermont, still \"farming\" without success, until,  after three years of crop failure, they decided to move to New York  State, arriving there in the summer of 1816.         ** There is equally good authority for placing the house in which  Smith was born across the line in Royalton.      Less prejudiced testimony gives an even less favorable view than this of  the elder Smith's business career in Vermont. Judge Daniel Woodward,  of the county court of Windsor, Vermont, near whose father's farm the  Smiths lived, says that the elder Smith while living there was a hunter  for Captain Kidd's treasure, and that he also \"became implicated with  one Jack Downing in counterfeiting money, but turned state's evidence  and escaped the penalty.\"* He had in earlier life been a Universalist,  but afterward became a Methodist. His spiritual welfare gave his wife  much concern, but although he had \"two visions\" while living in Vermont,  she did not accept his change of heart. She admits, however, that after  their removal to New York her husband obeyed the scriptural injunction,  \"your old men shall dream dreams,\" and she mentions several of these  dreams, the latest in 1819, giving the particulars of some of them. One  sample of these will suffice. The dreamer found himself in a beautiful  garden, with wide walks and a main walk running through the centre. \"On  each side of this was a richly carved seat, and on each seat were placed  six wooden images, each of which was the size of a very large man. When  I came to the first image on the right side it arose, bowed to me with  much deference. I then turned to the one which sat opposite to me, on  the left side, and it arose and bowed to me in the same manner as the  first. I continued turning first to the right and then to the left until  the whole twelve had made the obeisance, after which I was entirely  healed (of a lameness from which he then was suffering). I then asked my  guide the meaning of all this, but I awoke before I received an answer.\"         * Historical Magazine, 1870.      A similar wakefulness always manifested itself at the critical moment  in these dreams. What the world lost by this insomnia of the dreamer the  world will never know.    The Smiths' first residence in New York State was in the village  of Palmyra. There the father displayed a sign, \"Cake and Beer Shop,  \"selling\" gingerbread, pies, boiled eggs, root beer, and other like  notions,\" and he and his sons did odd jobs, gardening, harvesting, and  well-digging, when they could get them.*         * Tucker's \"Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism,\" p. 12.      They were very poor, and Mrs. Smith added to their income by painting  oilcloth table covers. After a residence of three years and a half in  Palmyra, the family took possession of a piece of land two miles south  of that place, on the border of Manchester. They had no title to it,  but as the owners were nonresident minors they were not disturbed. There  they put up a little log house, with two rooms on the ground floor  and two in the attic, which sheltered them all. Later, the elder Smith  contracted to buy the property and erected a farmhouse on it; but he  never completed his title to it.    While classing themselves as farmers, the Smiths were regarded by  their neighbors as shiftless and untrustworthy. They sold cordwood,  vegetables, brooms of their own manufacture, and maple sugar, continuing  to vend cakes in the village when any special occasion attracted a  crowd. It may be remarked here that, while Ontario County, New York, was  regarded as \"out West\" by seaboard and New England people in 1830,  its population was then almost as large as it is to-day (having 40,288  inhabitants according to the census of 1830 and 48,453 according to the  census of 1890). The father and several of the boys could not read,  and a good deal of the time of the younger sons was spent in hunting,  fishing, and lounging around the village.    The son Joseph did not rise above the social standing of his brothers.  The best that a Mormon biographer, Orson Pratt, could say of him as a  youth was that \"He could read without much difficulty, and write a very  imperfect hand, and had a very limited understanding of the elementary  rules of arithmetic. These were his highest and only attainments, while  the rest of those branches so universally taught in the common schools  throughout the United States were entirely unknown to him.\"* He was \"Joe  Smith\" to every one. Among the younger people he served as a butt  for jokes, and we are told that the boys who bought the cakes that he  peddled used to pay him in pewter twoshilling pieces, and that when he  called at the Palmyra Register office for his father's weekly paper, the  youngsters in the press room thought it fun to blacken his face with the  ink balls.         * \"Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism,\" p. 16.      Here are two pictures of the young man drawn by persons who saw him  constantly in the days of his vagabondage. The first is from Mr.  Tucker's book:--    \"At this period in the life and career of Joseph Smith, Jr., or 'Joe  Smith,' as he was universally named, and the Smith family, they were  popularly regarded as an illiterate, whiskey-drinking, shiftless,  irreligious race of people--the first named, the chief subject of this  biography, being unanimously voted the laziest and most worthless of  the generation. From the age of twelve to twenty years he is distinctly  remembered as a dull-eyed, flaxen-haired, prevaricating boy noted  only for his indolent and vagabondish character, and his habits  of exaggeration and untruthfulness. Taciturnity was among his  characteristic idiosyncrasies, and he seldom spoke to any one outside  of his intimate associates, except when first addressed by another;  and then, by reason of his extravagancies of statement, his word was  received with the least confidence by those who knew him best. He could  utter the most palpable exaggeration or marvellous absurdity with the  utmost apparent gravity. He nevertheless evidenced the rapid development  of a thinking, plodding, evil-brewing mental composition--largely given  to inventions of low cunning, schemes of mischief and deception, and  false and mysterious pretensions. In his moral phrenology the professor  might have marked the organ of secretiveness as very large, and that of  conscientiousness omitted. He was, however, proverbially good natured,  very rarely, if ever, indulging in any combative spirit toward any one,  whatever might be the provocation, and yet was never known to laugh.  Albeit, he seemed to be the pride of his indulgent father, who has been  heard to boast of him as the 'genus of the family,' quoting his own  expression.\"*         * \"Remarkable Visions.\"      The second (drawn a little later) is by Daniel Hendrix, a resident of  Palmyra, New York, at the time of which he speaks, and an assistant in  setting the type and reading the proof of the Mormon Bible:--    \"Every one knew him as Joe Smith. He had lived in Palmyra a few years  previous to my going there from Rochester. Joe was the most ragged,  lazy fellow in the place, and that is saying a good deal. He was about  twenty-five years old. I can see him now in my mind's eye, with his torn  and patched trousers held to his form by a pair of suspenders made out  of sheeting, with his calico shirt as dirty and black as the earth, and  his uncombed hair sticking through the holes in his old battered hat. In  winter I used to pity him, for his shoes were so old and worn out that  he must have suffered in the snow and slush; yet Joe had a jovial, easy,  don't-care way about him that made him a lot of warm friends. He was a  good talker, and would have made a fine stump speaker if he had had  the training. He was known among the young men I associated with as a  romancer of the first water. I never knew so ignorant a man as Joe  was to"]]]
