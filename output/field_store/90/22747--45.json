I do not believe that he knew, after a  half-hour's conversation with me, whether I was man or woman. That was  defeat number one.\"    \"And what was number two?\" Amelie was now thoroughly interested in  Angelique's gossip.    \"I left the dry, unappreciative philosopher, and devoted myself to charm  the handsome Colonel Philibert. He was all wit and courtesy, but my  failure was even more signal with him than with the cold Swede.\"    Amelie's eyes gave a sparkle of joy, which did not escape Angelique,  but she pretended not to see it. \"How was that? Tell me, pray, how you  failed with Colonel Philibert?\"    \"My cause of failure would not be a lesson for you, Amelie. Listen! I  got a speedy introduction to Colonel Philibert, who, I confess, is one  of the handsomest men I ever saw. I was bent on attracting him.\"    \"For shame, Angelique! How could you confess to aught so unwomanly!\"  There was a warmth in Amelie's tone that was less noticed by herself  than by her companion.    \"Well, it is my way of conquering the King's army. I shot my whole  quiver of arrows at Colonel Philibert, but, to my chagrin, hit not a  vital part! He parried every one, and returned them broken at my feet.  His persistent questioning about yourself, as soon as he discovered we  had been school companions at the Convent, quite foiled me. He was full  of interest about you, and all that concerned you, but cared not a fig  about me!\"    \"What could Colonel Philibert have to ask you about me?\" Amelie  unconsciously drew closer to her companion, and even clasped her arm by  an involuntary movement which did not escape her friend.    \"Why, he asked everything a gentleman could, with proper respect, ask  about a lady.\"    \"And what did you say?\"    \"Oh, not half enough to content him. I confess I felt piqued that he  only looked on me as a sort of pythoness to solve enigmas about you.  I had a grim satisfaction in leaving his curiosity irritated, but not  satisfied. I praised your beauty, goodness, and cleverness up to the  skies, however. I was not untrue to old friendship, Amelie!\" Angelique  kissed her friend on the cheek, who silently allowed what, in her  indignation a few moments ago, she would have refused.    \"But what said Colonel Philibert of himself? Never mind about me.\"    \"Oh, impatient that you are! He said nothing of himself. He was absorbed  in my stories concerning you. I told him as pretty a fable as La  Fontaine related of the Avare qui avait perdu son tresor! I said you  were a beautiful chatelaine besieged by an army of lovers, but the  knight errant Fortunatus had alone won your favor, and would receive  your hand! The brave Colonel! I could see he winced at this. His steel  cuirass was not invulnerable. I drew blood, which is more than you  would have dared to do, Amelie! But I discovered the truth hidden in his  heart. He is in love with you, Amelie de Repentigny!\"    \"Mad girl! How could you? How dare you speak so of me? What must Colonel  Philibert think?\"    \"Think? He thinks you must be the most perfect of your sex! Why, his  mind was made up about you, Amelie, before he said a word to me. Indeed,  he only just wanted to enjoy the supernal pleasure of hearing me sing  the praises of Amelie De Repentigny to the tune composed by himself.\"    \"Which you seem to have done, Angelique!\"    \"As musically as Mere St. Borgia when singing vespers in the Ursulines,\"  was Angelique's flippant reply.    Amelie knew how useless it was to expostulate. She swallowed her mingled  pleasure and vexation salt with tears she could not help. She changed  the subject by a violent wrench, and asked Angelique when she had last  seen Le Gardeur.    \"At the Intendant's levee the other day. How like you he is, too, only  less amiable!\"    Angelique did not respond readily to her friend's question about her  brother.    \"Less amiable? that is not like my brother. Why do you think him less  amiable than me?\"    \"Because he got angry with me at the ball given in honor of the arrival  of the Intendant, and I have not been able to restore him to perfect  good humor with me since.\"    \"Oh, then Le Gardeur completes the trio of those who are proof against  your fascinations?\" Amelie was secretly glad to hear of the displeasure  of Le Gardeur with Angelique.    \"Not at all, I hope, Amelie. I don't place Le Gardeur in the same  category with my other admirers. But he got offended because I seemed  to neglect him a little to cultivate this gay new Intendant. Do you know  him?\"    \"No; nor wish to! I have heard much said to his disadvantage. The  Chevalier La Corne St. Luc has openly expressed his dislike of the  Intendant for something that happened in Acadia.\"    \"Oh, the Chevalier La Corne is always so decided in his likes and  dislikes: one must either be very good or very bad to satisfy him!\"  replied Angelique with a scornful pout of her lips.    \"Don't speak ill of my godfather, Angelique; better be profane on any  other topic: you know my ideal of manly virtues is the Chevalier La  Corne,\" replied Amelie.    \"Well, I won't pull down your idol, then! I respect the brave old  soldier, too; but could wish him with the army in Flanders!\"    \"Thousands of estimable people augur ill from the accession of the  Intendant Bigot in New France, besides the Chevalier La Corne,\" Amelie  said after a pause. She disliked censuring even the Intendant.    \"Yes,\" replied Angelique, \"the Honnetes Gens do, who think themselves  bound to oppose the Intendant, because he uses the royal authority in a  regal way, and makes every one, high and low, do their devoir to Church  and State.\"    \"While he does his devoir to none! But I am no politician, Angelique.  But when so many good people call the Intendant a bad man, it behooves  one to be circumspect in 'cultivating him,' as you call it.\"    \"Well, he is rich enough to pay for all the broken pots: they say he  amassed untold wealth in Acadia, Amelie!\"    \"And lost the province for the king!\" retorted Amelie, with all the  asperity her gentle but patriotic spirit was capable of. \"Some say he  sold the country.\"    \"I don't care!\" replied the reckless beauty, \"he is like Joseph in  Egypt, next to Pharaoh in authority. He can shoe his horses with gold! I  wish he would shoe me with golden slippers--I would wear them, Amelie!\"    Angelique stamped her dainty foot upon the ground, as if in fancy she  already had them on.    \"It is shocking if you mean it!\" remarked Amelie pityingly, for she felt  Angelique was speaking her genuine thoughts. \"But is it true that the  Intendant is really as dissolute as rumor says?\"    \"I don't care if it be true: he is noble, gallant, polite, rich, and  all-powerful at Court. He is reported to be prime favorite of the  Marquise de Pompadour. What more do I want?\" replied Angelique warmly.    Amelie knew enough by report of the French Court to cause her to shrink  instinctively, as from a repulsive insect, at the name of the mistress  of Louis XV. She trembled at the thought of Angelique's infatuation, or  perversity, in suffering herself to be attracted by the glitter of the  vices of the Royal Intendant.    \"Angelique!\" exclaimed she, \"I have heard things of the Intendant that  would make me tremble for you, were you in earnest.\"    \"But I am in earnest! I mean to win and wear the Intendant of New  France, to show my superiority over the whole bevy of beauties competing  for his hand. There is not a girl in Quebec but would run away with him  tomorrow.\"    \"Fie, Angelique! such a libel upon our sex! You know better. But you  cannot love him?\"    \"Love him? No!\" Angelique repeated the denial scornfully. \"Love him! I  never thought of love and him together! He is not handsome, like your  brother Le Gardeur, who is my beau-ideal of a man I could love; nor has  the intellect and nobility of Colonel Philibert, who is my model of a  heroic man. I could love such men as them. But my ambition would not be  content with less than a governor or royal intendant in New France. In  old France I would not put up with less than the King himself!\"    Angelique laughed at her own extravagance, but she believed in it all  the same. Amelie, though shocked at her wildness, could not help smiling  at her folly.    \"Have you done raving?\" said she; \"I have no right to question your  selection of a lover or doubt your power, Angelique. But are you  sure there exists no insurmountable obstacle to oppose these high  aspirations? It is whispered that the Intendant has a wife, whom he  keeps in the seclusion of Beaumanoir. Is that true?\"    The words burnt like fire. Angelique's eyes flashed out daggers. She  clenched her delicate hands until her nails drew blood from her velvet  palms. Her frame quivered with suppressed passion. She grasped her  companion fiercely by the arm, exclaiming,--\"You have hit the secret  now, Amelie! It was to speak of that I sought you out this morning, for  I know you are wise, discreet, and every way better than I. It is all  true what I have said, and more too, Amelie. Listen! The Intendant has  made love to me with pointed gallantry that could have no other meaning  but that he honorably sought my hand. He has made me talked of and hated  by my own sex, who envied his preference of me. I was living in the  most gorgeous of fool's paradises, when a bird brought to my ear the  astounding news that a woman, beautiful as Diana, had been found in the  forest of Beaumanoir by some Hurons of Lorette, who were out hunting  with the Intendant. She was accompanied by a few Indians of a strange  tribe, the Abenaquais of Acadia. The woman was utterly exhausted by  fatigue, and lay asleep on a couch of dry leaves under a tree, when the  astonished Hurons led the Intendant to the spot where she lay.    \"Don't interrupt me, Amelie; I see you are amazed, but let me go on!\"  She held the hands of her companion firmly in her lap as she proceeded:    \"T"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27365"],[0,"Tales of Space and Time (#7)"],[1,"er, with limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and scant, and  the flood like a wall swift and white behind. And then death.    China was lit glowing white, but over Japan and Java and all the islands  of Eastern Asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of  the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to  salute its coming. Above was the lava, hot gases and ash, and below the  seething floods, and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the  earthquake shocks. Soon the immemorial snows of Thibet and the Himalaya  were melting and pouring down by ten million deepening converging  channels upon the plains of Burmah and Hindostan. The tangled summits of  the Indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places, and below the  hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that still struggled  feebly and reflected the blood-red tongues of fire. And in a rudderless  confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the broad river-ways to  that one last hope of men--the open sea.    Larger grew the star, and larger, hotter, and brighter with a terrible  swiftness now. The tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence, and the  whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged  incessantly, speckled with storm-tossed ships.    And then came a wonder. It seemed to those who in Europe watched for the  rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation. In a  thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled thither  from the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of hill  watched for that rising in vain. Hour followed hour through a terrible  suspense, and the star rose not. Once again men set their eyes upon the  old constellations they had counted lost to them forever. In England it  was hot and clear overhead, though the ground quivered perpetually, but  in the tropics, Sirius and Capella and Aldebaran showed through a veil  of steam. And when at last the great star rose near ten hours late, the  sun rose close upon it, and in the centre of its white heart was a disc  of black.    Over Asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the  sky, and then suddenly, as it hung over India, its light had been  veiled. All the plain of India from the mouth of the Indus to the mouths  of the Ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night, out of  which rose temples and palaces, mounds and hills, black with people.  Every minaret was a clustering mass of people, who fell one by one into  the turbid waters, as heat and terror overcame them. The whole land  seemed a-wailing, and suddenly there swept a shadow across that furnace  of despair, and a breath of cold wind, and a gathering of clouds, out of  the cooling air. Men looking up, near blinded, at the star, saw that a  black disc was creeping across the light. It was the moon, coming  between the star and the earth. And even as men cried to God at this  respite, out of the East with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang  the sun. And then star, sun and moon rushed together across the  heavens.    So it was that presently, to the European watchers, star and sun rose  close upon each other, drove headlong for a space and then slower, and  at last came to rest, star and sun merged into one glare of flame at the  zenith of the sky. The moon no longer eclipsed the star but was lost to  sight in the brilliance of the sky. And though those who were still  alive regarded it for the most part with that dull stupidity that  hunger, fatigue, heat and despair engender, there were still men who  could perceive the meaning of these signs. Star and earth had been at  their nearest, had swung about one another, and the star had passed.  Already it was receding, swifter and swifter, in the last stage of its  headlong journey downward into the sun.    And then the clouds gathered, blotting out the vision of the sky, the  thunder and lightning wove a garment round the world; all over the earth  was such a downpour of rain as men had never before seen, and where the  volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended torrents  of mud. Everywhere the waters were pouring off the land, leaving  mud-silted ruins, and the earth littered like a storm-worn beach with  all that had floated, and the dead bodies of the men and brutes, its  children. For days the water streamed off the land, sweeping away soil  and trees and houses in the way, and piling huge dykes and scooping out  Titanic gullies over the country side. Those were the days of darkness  that followed the star and the heat. All through them, and for many  weeks and months, the earthquakes continued.    But the star had passed, and men, hunger-driven and gathering courage  only slowly, might creep back to their ruined cities, buried granaries,  and sodden fields. Such few ships as had escaped the storms of that time  came stunned and shattered and sounding their way cautiously through the  new marks and shoals of once familiar ports. And as the storms subsided  men perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than of yore, and the  sun larger, and the moon, shrunk to a third of its former size, took now  fourscore days between its new and new.    But of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men, of the saving  of laws and books and machines, of the strange change that had come over  Iceland and Greenland and the shores of Baffin's Bay, so that the  sailors coming there presently found them green and gracious, and could  scarce believe their eyes, this story does not tell. Nor of the  movement of mankind now that the earth was hotter, northward and  southward towards the poles of the earth. It concerns itself only with  the coming and the passing of the Star.    The Martian astronomers--for there are astronomers on Mars, although  they are very different beings from men--were naturally profoundly  interested by these things. They saw them from their own standpoint of  course. \"Considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was  flung through our solar system into the sun,\" one wrote, \"it is  astonishing what a little damage the earth, which it missed so narrowly,  has sustained. All the familiar continental markings and the masses of  the seas remain intact, and indeed the only difference seems to be a  shrinkage of the white discolouration (supposed to be frozen water)  round either pole.\" Which only shows how small the vastest of human  catastrophes may seem, at a distance of a few million miles.          A Story of the Stone Age          A STORY OF THE STONE AGE      I--UGH-LOMI AND UYA    This story is of a time beyond the memory of man, before the beginning  of history, a time when one might have walked dryshod from France (as we  call it now) to England, and when a broad and sluggish Thames flowed  through its marshes to meet its father Rhine, flowing through a wide and  level country that is under water in these latter days, and which we  know by the name of the North Sea. In that remote age the valley which  runs along the foot of the Downs did not exist, and the south of Surrey  was a range of hills, fir-clad on the middle slopes, and snow-capped for  the better part of the year. The cores of its summits still remain as  Leith Hill, and Pitch Hill, and Hindhead. On the lower slopes of the  range, below the grassy spaces where the wild horses grazed, were  forests of yew and sweet-chestnut and elm, and the thickets and dark  places hid the grizzly bear and the hyaena, and the grey apes clambered  through the branches. And still lower amidst the woodland and marsh and  open grass along the Wey did this little drama play itself out to the  end that I have to tell. Fifty thousand years ago it was, fifty thousand  years--if the reckoning of geologists is correct.    And in those days the spring-time was as joyful as it is now, and sent  the blood coursing in just the same fashion. The afternoon sky was blue  with piled white clouds sailing through it, and the southwest wind came  like a soft caress. The new-come swallows drove to and fro. The reaches  of the river were spangled with white ranunculus, the marshy places were  starred with lady's-smock and lit with marsh-mallow wherever the  regiments of the sedges lowered their swords, and the northward-moving  hippopotami, shiny black monsters, sporting clumsily, came floundering  and blundering through it all, rejoicing dimly and possessed with one  clear idea, to splash the river muddy.    Up the river and well in sight of the hippopotami, a number of little  buff-coloured animals dabbled in the water. There was no fear, no  rivalry, and no enmity between them and the hippopotami. As the great  bulks came crashing through the reeds and smashed the mirror of the  water into silvery splashes, these little creatures shouted and  gesticulated with glee. It was the surest sign of high spring. \"Boloo!\"  they cried. \"Baayah. Boloo!\" They were the children of the men folk, the  smoke of whose encampment rose from the knoll at the river's bend.  Wild-eyed youngsters they were, with matted hair and little broad-nosed  impish faces, covered (as some children are covered even nowadays) with  a delicate down of hair. They were narrow in the loins and long in the  arms. And their ears had no lobes, and had little pointed tips, a thing  that still, in rare instances, survives. Stark-naked vivid little  gipsies, as active as monkeys and as full of chatter, though a little  wanting in words.    Their elders were hidden from the wallowing hippopotami by the crest of  the knoll. The human squatting-place was a trampled area among the dead  brown fronds of Royal Fern, through which the crosiers of this year's  growth were unrolling to the light and warmth. The fire was a  smouldering heap of char, light grey and black, replenished by the old  women from time to time with brown leaves. Most of the men were  asleep--they slept sitting with their foreheads on"]]]
