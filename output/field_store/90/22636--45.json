The extra time it takes in making  the dovetailed joints will greatly add to the durability of the box. The  box can be made much stronger by nailing the sides and ends to posts 2  in. square placed on the inside. Cleats should also be placed on the  inside, at the bottom, as shown. Fasten four blocks, 2 in. square, to  the bottom for the box to rest upon. These can be attached with long  screws run through from the bottom of the box.    [Illustration: Fig. 2--Design of the Covering Strip Put on Over the  Burlap]    The green burlap is glued to the outside of the box. Be careful not to  apply too much glue on the burlap, or it will soak through. This should  be tried out on a scrap piece, and when the proper application of glue  is ascertained, applied to one side of the burlap and stuck on the box.  Place the cloth on so the weave will run in the same direction on all  sides. The oak slats are cut and fit over the burlap as shown in Fig. 2.  Care should be taken to make the mitered joints a tight fit. After the  miters are all cut and the location of the squares, found, they are  marked so that pieces of red burlap may be placed over the green before  the slats are fastened permanently. The slats are put in place over the  burlap and fastened with small brass screws.    Cover the top or lid with green burlap, allowing the edges to lap over  the ends and sides and fasten under the side strips. This top can be  stuffed with excelsior, if desired, and tacks with large heads driven in  to hold it in place. The slats can be stained any color to suit the  maker. They should be removed from the box when being stained so as not  to spot or stain the burlap.          QUARTER-SAWED OAK SETTEE      The mission settee shown in the accompanying picture should be made of  quarter-sawed white oak. The material needed will be as follows:       4 posts, 3-1/4 by 3-1/4 by 36-1/2 in., S-4-S.     4 end rails, 1-1/2 by 5 by 32 in., S-4-S.    12 end slats, 5/8 by 3-1/2 by 24 in., S-4-S.     1 front rail, 1-1/2 by 7 by 87 in., S-4-S.     1 lower back rail, 1-1/2 by 9 by 87 in., S-4-S.     1 upper back rail, 1-1/2 by 12 by 87 in., S-4-S.     2 cleats for seat frame, 1-1/2 by 2 by 82 in., S-4-S.     2 cleats for seat frame, 1-1/2 by 2 by 32 in., S-4-S.    [Illustration: Mission Settee Made of Quarter-Sawed Oak]    On account of the unusual width of the pieces that go into the makeup of  this settee, it will be necessary to have the wood thoroughly seasoned  before putting them together, otherwise shrinkage will cause them to  crack open.    Begin work by making the ends of the settee first. Cut the posts to  length, chamfering both top and bottoms somewhat so that they shall not  splinter or cause injury to the hands. Next lay out and cut the mortises  as shown on the drawing. With the posts finished, lay out the end rails,  cutting the tenons and the mortises into which the ends of the slats are  to be fitted.    It should be noted that the drawing calls for the \"setting in\" of the  whole of the ends of the slats, there being no shoulders. This is much  easier and gives just as satisfactory a result, provided the sides of  the mortises are carefully cut.    Thoroughly scrape and sandpaper all these parts and then put the ends  together. In addition to the glue it will be well to through pin each of  the tenons and mortises. These pins may be put in flush and permanent on  the ends of the settee. On the side rails, however, the pins are to be  allowed to project so that they can be removed, and no glue is used in  the joint.    While the glue of the ends is hardening, prepare the rails of front and  back. Scrape and sandpaper these and when the clamps can be removed from  the ends put the whole frame together. The ends of all projecting tenons  are chamfered.    The illustration shows a loose leather cushion. There is quite a variety  of materials out of which such a cushion can be made. The best, of  course, is leather. In the highest class of furniture where loose  cushions are used, the seat base is formed by solidly mortising a frame  together on which is woven a heavy cane seating. This in turn is  fastened to the inside of the piece of furniture, and the cushions  when placed upon it make a very comfortable seat. The stock bill for  this settee calls for such a frame. Wood slats may be substituted if  desired.    [Illustration: Detail of the Oak Settee]    This piece of furniture will look well if finished in weathered oak. See  that all glue is removed from the surface, and that the wood is clean  and smooth, and apply a coat of weathered oak oil stain. Sandpaper this  lightly with No. 00 paper when the stain has thoroughly dried, and put  on a coat of lackluster or an equivalent.          A SCREEN      In selecting or making up mission furniture for the home, a screen is  necessary sometimes to add to the appearance of a room. The screen shown  in the accompanying illustration consists of a few parts which are  easily put together. The stock can be bought of any planing mill planed,  sanded and cut to the proper lengths. The cloth, which should be of dark  color, can be purchased at a dry goods store. The following list of  material will be needed.      6 posts, 1 in. square by 65 in.    6 rails, 3/4 in. square by 18 in.    6 rails, 1/2 in. square by 18 in.    3 panels, 1/4 by 3 by 18 in.    6 yd. of cloth.    4 double-acting hinges.    2 doz. 2-1/2-in. slender screws.    Cut or plow a groove 1/4 in. wide and 1/4 in. deep in the center of one  surface on each of the 3/4-in. rails. Cut out the ends with a compass  saw. The five holes are bored with a 1-in. bit. The edges of these  panels are inserted in the grooves of the 3/4-in. rails, using plenty of  good glue.    When the glue has dried for at least 24 hours the screen frame can be  put together. Holes for the screws should be bored through the posts  where the 3/4-in. rails are joined and a screw turned into the end grain  of each rail.    Scrape off all the surplus glue and sandpaper all the parts well. When  this is done the finish can be applied. Any one of the mission stains  can be used and finished with wax and polished.    [Illustration: Detail of One Section]    The cloth is cut to length, a hem sewed on each end and one 1/2-in. rail  put through each hem. Place the top rail in position and screw it fast.  Stretch the cloth tight and fasten the lower 1/2-in. rail with screws at  the bottom. Each section of the screen is finished in the same way.    The hinges are attached about 4 in. from each end of the posts in the  same manner as hanging a door.    The sections can be made up in various ways to suit the builder. Instead  of using cloth, heavy paste-board, or board made up to take the place  of plaster on walls of dwellings, may be substituted, thus forming a  ground that will take paint and bronze decorations. A piece of this  material can be easily cut to fit the opening in each section.    [Illustration: Screen of Three Sections]          A MISSION BOOKRACK      The accompanying sketch shows a bookrack designed strictly along mission  lines. Enough stock may be found among the scrap, as no piece is over 1  in, in width or thickness. If stock is not on hand, secure the  following, cut to exact lengths:      2 stretchers, 1 by 1 by 20 in., S-4-S.    4 posts, 1 by 1 by 7-1/2 in., S-4-S.    4 rails, 1 by 1 by 7 in., S-4-S.    8 slats, 1/2 by 1/2 by 3-1/2 in., S-4-S.    Arrange the pieces as they are to be in the finished rack and number  both parts of each joint. There will be twelve lap joints, and great  care must be taken to mark them accurately and to cut to exactly half  the depth of each piece.    First fit the posts and rails of the ends. To mark the width of each  notch, lay the piece which is to fit into the notch upon it and thus get  the exact size. Knife lines must be used for the width and light gauge  lines for the depth of each notch.    [Illustration: Detail of the Bookrack]    Next lay out and cut joints between the stretchers and ends.    In each end there are four slats which should be mortised into the  rails 1/4 in. Glue the pieces in place and clamp them with handscrews.    A rubber-headed tack in the bottom of each post will prevent the marring  of the surface upon which the rack is to rest.    [Illustration: The Complete Bookrack]    Mission, weathered or fumed-oak stain will look well. A waxed finish  should be used. Before applying the wax, it is well to use a very thin  coat of shellac as a foundation. Let this coat stand for a few hours and  allow an interval of at least an hour between applying the coats of wax.    Should the rack wind a little, it may be remedied by cutting off part of  two diagonally opposite racks.          A ROUND EXTENSION DINING TABLE      [Illustration: Detail of the Table]    This extension table should be made of some hard wood, preferably white  oak. It will be a difficult matter to secure legs of the sizes indicated  in solid pieces of clear stock. It will be possible, however, to  secure them veneered upon white-pine cores. If the veneering is properly  done these will serve the purpose very well, the lighter weight, due to  the white-pine core, being an advantage. The circular facing is best  made by first sawing a segment of the circle of the size wanted and then  veneering the outer surface of this. Order the following stock:      4 legs, 3 by 3 by 30-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 leg, 5 by 5 by 30-1/2 in., S-4-S.    4 rails, 1-1/8 by 5 by 23 in., S-2-S.    4 facing segments, 1-1/8 by 3-1/4 in. on a 24-in. radius.    1 top, 1-1/8 in. thick on a 27-in. radius, S-2-S;    3 extra boards, 1-1/8 by 12 by 55 in., S-2-S.    4 slides, 1-1/8 by 2-3/4 by 36-1/2 in., S-4-S, maple.    2 slides, 1-1/4 by 2-3/4 by 36-1/2 in., S-4-S, maple.    4 frame pieces, 7/8 by 3 by 9 in., S-4-S, maple.    2 frame pieces, 7/8 by 6 by 28 in., S-4-S, maple.    2 frame pieces, 7/8 by 4 by 23-1/2 in., S-4-S, maple.

He got his pinch of salt all ready, as his friends down  below kept calling and jeering: \"Now you've got him, now is your  chance.\" But just as he was going to leap forward and drop the salt on  its tail, the Creeper gave a tiny little laugh like \"_Tee-tee-tee_,\"  spread its wings, for it could fly very well, and sailed away to the  bottom of the next tree to do the spiral staircase all over again, while  Smarty Brownie was so mad that he jumped to the ground and hid away from  his friends for two days. When he came back he did not talk quite so  much as he used to. But to this day you can see the staircase of  toadstools on the tree trunks where the Brownie went up.      TALE 18    The Pot-herb that Sailed with the Pilgrims    \"Come,\" said the Guide, \"to-day I am going to show you a Pot-herb that  came from England with the Pilgrim Fathers and spread over the whole of  America. There is a story about it that will keep it ever in your  memory.\"    [Illustration: The Pilgrim's Pot-herb]    The Pilgrims had landed in Massachusetts, and slowly made farms for  themselves as they cleared off the forest. They had a very hard time at  first, but the Indians helped them; sometimes with gifts of venison, and  sometimes by showing them which things in the woods were good to eat.    There was a Squaw named Monapini, \"the Root-digger,\" who was very  clever at finding forest foods. She became friendly with a white woman  named Ruth Pilgrim, and so Ruth's family got the benefit of it, and  always had on the table many good things that came from the woods.    One day, long after the farms were cleared and doing well, the white  woman said, \"See, Mother Monapini, thou hast shown me many things, now I  have somewhat to show thee. There hath grown up in our wheat field a  small herb that must have come from England with the wheat, for hitherto  I have not seen it elsewhere. We call it lamb's-quarter, for the lamb  doth eat it by choice. Or maybe because we do eat it with a quarter of  lamb. Nevertheless it maketh a good pot-herb when boiled.\"    The old Indian woman's eyes were fixed on the new plant that was good to  eat: and she said, \"Is it very good, oh white sister?\"    \"Yes, and our medicine men do say that it driveth out the poison that  maketh itch and spots on the skin.\" After a moment Monapini said, \"It  looketh to me like the foot of a wild goose.\"    \"Well found,\" chuckled Ruth, \"for sometimes our people do call it by  that very name.\"    \"That tells me different,\" said the Indian.    \"What mean you,\" said Ruth.    \"Is not a goose foot very strong, so it never catcheth cold in the icy  water?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And this hath the shape of a goose foot?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then my Shaman tells that it is by such likeness that the Great Spirit  showeth the goose foot plant to be charged with the driving out of  colds.\"    \"It may be so,\" said the white woman, \"but this I know. It is very good  and helpeth the whole body.\"    The Indian picked a handful of the pot-herbs, then stared hard at the  last; a very tall and strong one.    \"What hast thou now, Monapini?\" The red woman pointed to the stem of the  lamb's-quarter, whereon were long red streaks, and said: \"This I see,  that, even as the white-man's herb came over the sea and was harmless  and clean while it was weak, but grew strong and possessed this field,  then was streaked to midheight with blood, so also shall they be who  brought it--streaked at last to the very waist with blood--not the white  men's but the dark purple blood of the Indian. This the voices tell me  is in the coming years, that this is what we shall get again for helping  you--destruction in return for kindness. Mine inner eyes have seen it.\"  She threw down the new pot-herb and glided away, to be seen no more in  the settlements of the white men.    And Ruth, as she gazed after her, knew that it was true. Had she not  heard her people talking and planning? For even as the weed seed came  with the wheat, so evil spirits came with the God-fearing Pilgrims, and  already these were planning to put the heathens to the sword, when the  Colony was strong enough.    So the Indian woman read the truth in the little pot-herb that sailed  and landed with the Pilgrims; that stands in our fields to this day,  streaked with the blood of the passing race--standing, a thing of  remembrance.      TALE 19    How the Red Clover Got the White Mark on Its Leaves    [Illustration: How the Red Clover Got the White Mark on Its Leaves]    Once upon a time a Bee, a Bug, and a Cow went marching up to Mother  Carey's palace in the hemlock grove, to tell her of their troubles. They  complained that food was poor and scarce, and they were tired of the  kinds that grew along the roadsides.    Mother Carey heard them patiently, then she said: \"Yes, you have some  reason to complain, so I will send you a new food called Clover. Its  flower shall be full of honey for the Bee, its leaves full of cowfood  and its cellar shall be stocked with tiny pudding bags of meal for the  Bug, that is for good little Bug-folks who live underground.\"    Now the tribes of the Bee, the Bug, and the Cow had a fine time  feasting, for the new food was everywhere.    But Cows are rather stupid you know. They found the new food so good  that they kept on munching everything that had three round leaves,  thinking it was Clover, and very soon a lot of them were poisoned with  strange plants that no wise Cow would think of eating.    So Mother Carey called a Busy Brownie, and put him on guard to keep the  Cows from eating the poison plants by mistake.    At first it was good fun, and the Brownie enjoyed it because it made him  feel important. But he got very tired of his job and wanted to go to the  ball game.    He sat down on a toadstool, and looked very glum. He could hear the  other Brownies shouting at the game, and that made him feel worse. Then  he heard a great uproar, and voices yelling \"A home run!\" \"A home run!\"  That drove him wild. He had been whittling the edge of the toadstool  with his knife, and now he slashed off a big piece of the cap, he was so  mad.    Then up he got and said to the Cows: \"See here, you fool Cows, I can't  stay here for ever trying to keep you from eating poison, but I'll do  this much. I'll stamp all the good-to-eat leaves with a mark that will  be your guide.\"    [Illustration: The Shamrock]    So he made a rubber stamp out of part of the toadstool he was sitting  on, and stamped every Clover leaf in that pasture, so the Cows could be  sure, then skipped away to the ball game.    When Mother Carey heard of his running away from his job, she was very  angry. She said: \"Well, you Bad Brownie, you should be ashamed, but that  white mark was a good idea so I'll forgive you, if you go round, and put  it on every Clover leaf in the world.\"    He had to do it, though it looked like an endless task, and he never  would have finished it, had not the other Brownies all over the world  come to help him; so it was done at last. And that is the reason that  every Clover leaf to-day has on it the white mark like an arrowhead, the  Brownie sign for \"good-to eat.\"    The Cows get along better now, but still they are very stupid; they go  munching ahead without thinking, and will even eat the blossoms which  belong to the Bees. And the Bees have to buzz very loudly and even sting  the Cows on their noses to keep them from stealing the bee-food. The  good little Bugs underground have the best time, for there the Cows can  not harm them, and the Bees never come near. They eat when they are  hungry and sleep when they are cold, which is their idea of a good time;  so except for some little quarrels between the Cows and the Bees they  have all gotten along very well ever since.      TALE 20    The Shamrock and Her Three Sisters    [Illustration: Yellow-haired Hob. Shamrock's blonde sister]    The Shamrock is really the White Clover. It is much the same shape as  the Red Clover, and has the same food bags in its cellar. It is just as  good for Cows and even better for Bees; so the Brownie stamped all its  leaves with the white arrow mark, as you can plainly see. This plant,  as you know, is the emblem of Ireland.    The story-tellers say that St. Patrick was preaching to Leary, the  heathen King of Tara in Ireland hoping to turn him into a Christian. The  king listened attentively, but he was puzzled by St. Patrick's account  of the Trinity. \"Stop,\" said the king. \"How can there be three Gods in  one and only one God where there are three. That is impossible.\" St.  Patrick stooped down and picking up a Shamrock leaf, said: \"See, there  it is, growing in your own soil; there are three parts but only one  leaf.\" The king was so much struck by this proof that he became a  Christian and ever since the Shamrock has been the emblem of Ireland.    Now to fill out the history of the Clovers, I should tell you of the  other three. The next is called Alsike, or the Pink Clover.    When you look at this Alsike or Alsatian Clover, you might think its  mother was a red clover and its father a white one, for it is about half  way between them in size, and its bloom is pink on the outside and white  in the middle. Evidently, the Brownie didn't think much of it, for he  did not put his arrow mark on its leaves. Still the Cows think it is  good, the Bees think it is fine, and it always carried lots of food bags  in its cellar. So also does the next sister--Melilot, the Yellow Clover  or Honey-lotus--and the last and sweetest of them all, is the Sweet  Clover that spreads sweet smells in the old-fashioned garden.
