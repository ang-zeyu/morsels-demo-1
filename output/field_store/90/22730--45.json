Otherwise there would be no point in the lines in which Ovid  makes his book--sent from Pontus after his banishment--deplore its  exclusion. The book is supposed to climb from the Forum to the temple of  Apollo:      Signa peregrinis ubi sunt alterna columnis      Belides et stricto barbarus ense pater    Quaeque viri docto veteres coepere novique      Pectore lecturis inspicienda patent.    Quaerebam fratres exceptis scilicet illis      Quos suus optaret non genuisse parens;    Quaerentem frustra custos e sedibus illis      Praepositus sancto iussit abire loco[41].        Where, set between each pair of columns from some      foreign quarry, are statues of the Danaids, and their      barbarous father with drawn sword; and where whatever      the minds of men of old or men of to-day have imagined,      is laid open for a reader's use. I sought my brethren,      save those of course whom their father would fain have      never begotten; and, while I was seeking for them in      vain, he who was set over the room bade me leave that      holy ground.    The second couplet can only mean that old books and new books were alike  to be found there. The general nature of the collection, and its extent,  may be further gathered from the advice which Horace gives to his friend  Celsus:      Quid mihi Celsus agit? monitus multumque monendus    Privatas ut quaerat opes, et tangere vitet    Scripta Palatinus quaecunque recepit Apollo[42].        What is my friend Celsus about? he who has been      reminded, and must still be reminded again and again,      that he should draw upon his own resources, and be      careful to avoid the multifarious writings which      Palatine Apollo has taken under his charge.    A man might say now-a-days, \"Trust to your own wits, and don't go so often  to the library of the British Museum.\"    Aulus Gellius, who lived A.D. 117-180, speaks of \"sitting with a party of  friends in the library of the palace of Tiberius, when a book happened to  be taken down with the title M. Catonis Nepotis,\" and they began asking  one another who this M. Cato Nepos might be[43]. This library contained  also public records[44].    The same writer tells a story of a grammatical difficulty which was to be  settled by reference to a book _in templo Pacis_, in the forum of  Vespasian; and again, when a particular book was wanted, \"we hunted for it  diligently,\" he says, \"and, when we had found it in the temple of Peace,  we read it[45].\"    The library in the forum of Trajan, often called _Bibliotheca Ulpia_, was  apparently the Public Record Office of Rome. Aulus Gellius mentions that  some decrees of former praetors had fallen in his way there when he was  looking for something else, and that he had been allowed to read them[46];  and a statement of Vopiscus is still more conclusive as to the nature of  its contents. It tells us, moreover, something about the arrangement. In  his life of the Emperor Tacitus (Sept. A.D. 275--Apr. 276) Vopiscus says:        And lest anybody should think that I have given too      hasty a credence to a Greek or Latin author, the Ulpian      Library has in its sixth press (_armarium_) an ivory      volume (_librum elephantinum_) in which the following      decree of the Senate, signed by Tacitus with his own      hand, is recorded, etc.[47]    Again, in his life of the Emperor Aurelian, the same writer records how  his friend Junius Tiberianus, prefect of the city, had urged him to  undertake the task, and had assured him that: \"even the linen-books  (_libri lintei_) shall be brought out of the Ulpian library for your  use[48].\"    Books could occasionally be borrowed from a public library, but whether  from one of those in the city of Rome, I cannot say. The scene of the  story which proves this is laid by Aulus Gellius at Tibur (Tivoli), where  the library was in the temple of Hercules--another instance of the care of  a library being entrusted to a temple. Aulus Gellius and some friends of  his were assembled in a rich man's villa there at the hottest season of  the year. They were drinking melted snow, a proceeding against which one  of the party, a peripatetic philosopher, vehemently protested, urging  against the practice the authority of numerous physicians and of Aristotle  himself. But none the less the party went on drinking snow-water.  Whereupon \"he fetched a treatise by Aristotle out of the library of Tibur,  which was then very conveniently accommodated in the temple of Hercules,  and brought it to us, saying----[49].\" But I need not finish the  quotation, as it has no bearing on my special subject.    It is probable that numerous collections of books had been got together by  individuals in Rome, before it occurred to Augustus and his friends to  erect public libraries. One such library, that belonging to the rich and  luxurious Lucullus, has been noticed as follows by Plutarch[50]:        His procedure in regard to books was interesting and      remarkable. He collected fine copies in large numbers;      and if he was splendid in their acquisition, he was more      so in their use. His libraries were accessible to all,      and the adjoining colonnades and reading-rooms were      freely open to Greeks, who, gladly escaping from the      routine of business, resorted thither for familiar      converse, as to a shelter presided over by the Muses.    The Romans were not slow in following the example set by Lucullus; and a  library presently became indispensable in every house, whether the owner  cared for reading or not. This fashionable craze is denounced by Seneca  (writing about A.D. 49) in a vehement outburst of indignation, which  contains so many valuable facts about library arrangement, that I will  give a free translation of it.        Outlay upon studies, best of all outlays, is reasonable      so long only as it is kept within certain limits. What      is the use of books and libraries innumerable, if scarce      in a lifetime the master reads the titles? A student is      burdened by a crowd of authors, not instructed; and it      is far better to devote yourself to a few, than to lose      your way among a multitude.        Forty thousand books were burnt at Alexandria. I leave      others to praise this splendid monument of royal      opulence, as for example Livy, who regards it as \"a      noble work of royal taste and royal thoughtfulness.\" It      was not taste, it was not thoughtfulness, it was learned      extravagance--nay not even learned, for they had bought      their books for the sake of show, not for the sake of      learning--just as with many who are ignorant even of the      lowest branches of learning books are not instruments of      study, but ornaments of dining-rooms. Procure then as      many books as will suffice for use; but not a single one      for show. You will reply: \"Outlay on such objects is      preferable to extravagance on plate or paintings.\"      Excess in all directions is bad. Why should you excuse a      man who wishes to possess book-presses inlaid with      _arbor-vitae_ wood or ivory: who gathers together masses      of authors either unknown or discredited; who yawns      among his thousands of books; and who derives his chief      delight from their edges and their tickets?        You will find then in the libraries of the most arrant      idlers all that orators or historians have      written--book-cases built up as high as the ceiling.      Nowadays a library takes rank with a bathroom as a      necessary ornament of a house. I could forgive such      ideas, if they were due to extravagant desire for      learning. As it is, these productions of men whose      genius we revere, paid for at a high price, with their      portraits ranged in line above them, are got together to      adorn and beautify a wall[51].    A library was discovered in Rome by Signor Lanciani in 1883 while  excavating a house of the 4th century on the Esquiline in the modern Via  dello Statuto. I will narrate the discovery in his own words.        I was struck, one afternoon, with the appearance of a      rather spacious hall [it was about 23 feet long by 15      feet broad], the walls of which were plain and      unornamented up to a certain height, but beautifully      decorated above in stucco-work. The decoration consisted      of fluted pilasters, five feet apart from centre to      centre, enclosing a plain square surface, in the middle      of which there were medallions, also in stucco-work, two      feet in diameter. As always happens in these cases, the      frame was the only well-preserved portion of the      medallions. Of the images surrounded by the frames, of      the medallions themselves, absolutely nothing was left      _in situ_, except a few fragments piled up at the foot      of the wall, which, however, could be identified as      having been representations of human faces. My hope      that, at last, after fifteen years of excavations, I had      succeeded in discovering a library, was confirmed beyond      any doubt by a legend, written, or rather painted, in      bright red colour on one of the frames. There was but      one name POLONIVS THYAN ..., but this name told more      plainly the purpose of the apartment than if I had      discovered there the actual bookshelves and their      contents[52].    When I had the pleasure of meeting Signor Lanciani in Rome in April, 1898,  he most kindly gave me his own sketch of the pilasters and medallion,  taken at the moment of discovery. I am therefore able to reproduce exactly  (fig. 6) one compartment of the wall of the library above described. The  height of the blank wall below the stucco-work, against which the  furniture containing the books stood, has been laid down as about 3 feet 6  inches, on the authority of Professor Middleton[53].

(_Tovomita pentapetala_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Namakpakan_, _Tagudin_, Iloc. (?).    Uses.--An oil expressed from the fruit is used in Ilocos for  illuminating purposes. The flowers are astringent and are used in  infusion in cases of diarrhoea. The oil of the fruit is also used  locally in rheumatism, tumefactions and other painful conditions. In  some countries of Malaysia the oil is used in the same way especially  in beriberi and the periarticular inflammations incident to puerperium.    Botanical Description.--Straight trunk about 8' in diameter, with  milky sap. Leaves 1 1/2' long, sessile, opposite, ovate, expanded,  minutely notched and glabrous, with a small downy swelling at  the base, superior and glued to the branch. Flowers terminal,  in racemes, with opposite pedicels. Calyx white, of 2 rounded  leaflets bent downwards. Corolla white, 5 petals (not 4), oval,  concave, twice as long as the calyx. Stamens numerous, joined to the  receptacle. Filaments slightly longer than the corolla. Anthers oval,  2-celled. Ovary superior, oval. Style longer than the stamens. Stigma  peltate, sometimes bilobed, sometimes 4-lobed. Fruit about the size  of an acorn, oval, fleshy, containing a milky juice; it is 2-celled  and each cell contains a solitary, hard seed; of these one aborts.    Habitat.--It grows near the sea. Blooms in December.        _Calophyllum Inophyllum_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Palo Maria_, Sp.-Fil.; _Bitanhol_, _Tamawian_, _Dankalan_,  _Dinkalin_, Tag.; _Dankalan Bitaog_, Vis., Pam., Bik.    Uses.--From the seeds of the fruit there exudes a yellowish-green oil,  bitter and aromatic. It is used in some districts for illuminating  purposes. Its density is 0.942 and its point of solidification 5°  above zero. In India it is used by inunction in rheumatism and in the  Philippines locally over the stomach in indigestion and colic. The  bark of the tree when incised exudes a green resin of a very agreeable  odor, which is used as an application to wounds and old sores. In  India it is used in the same way. This resin is fusible and dissolves  completely in alcohol. It has been mistaken for the _tacamahaca_  of India, which, however, is a product of the _C. calaba_, L. Mixed  with equal parts of pitch and wax it is applied to the chest as a  plaster in bronchitis. A decoction of the leaves is used for purulent  ophthalmia in some parts of India and Mauritius. The pounded bark is  applied locally in orchitis and epididymitis. We have had occasion to  use a mixture of equal parts of the resin with white vaseline spread  on linen and applied between the shoulder blades; in the persistent  cough of senile bronchitis the relief was marked.    Botanical Description.--A large tree with beautiful, dark green  leaves 4-5' long, opposite, entire, large, oval with nerves numerous,  fine and perpendicular to the midrib. Petioles very short. Flowers  large, white, sweet-scented, axillary, in racemes of 7-9. Calyx  white, of 4 sepals. Corolla white, of 4 petals. Stamens numerous,  polyadelphous. Ovary rudimentary in the male flower; unilocular and  uniovulate in the female. Style single and large. Drupe superior,  with a hard, bony pit, containing a thicker, softer substance which  envelopes a seed of like consistency.    Habitat.--It is found in central Luzon and in the Provinces of Tayabas,  La Union and Ilocos. Blooms in November.        _Mesua ferrea_, L. (_Calophyllum apetalum_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Malabukbuk_ (?), Tag.    Uses.--We do not know to what use the Filipinos put this plant, but  in India the sweet flowers are dried and sold in the bazars under the  name of _Nag-Kasar_ or _Nagesur_, which is used as a mild stimulant,  but especially as a perfume.    A dark oil is expressed from the seeds, its density 0.954 and its  solidifying point 5° above zero. In northern Canara it is used locally  in rheumatism. The incised root bark exudes a resinous sap which is  a good bitter tonic. The infusion of the wood is equally good. The  dried flowers, finely powdered and mixed with oil or lard make a useful  ointment for acute hemorrhoids. The fruit is acrid and purgative.    Botanical Description.--A tree with leaves long-petioled, oblong,  lanceolate, acuminate, rounded at the base, thick, coriaceous,  upper surface lustrous, lower surface greenish or covered with a  waxy, ash-colored powder. Flowers terminal or axillary, solitary,  yellowish. Calyx 4 imbricated sepals, orbiculate, slightly  pubescent. Corolla 4 persistent petals, wedge-shaped, short, with  rounded points. Stamens indefinite, free, in 5-6 series. Ovary free,  2-celled, each cell containing 2 ovules. Style bilobed. Fruit nearly  unilocular, ovate, acuminate, encompassed at its base by the sepals,  the lower part of the petals, and crowned by the style. Pericarp  woody, dehiscent at the tip by 2-4 valves; contains 1-4 seeds,  slightly orbiculate, coriaceous.    Habitat.--Common in the forests.          DIPTEROCARPEÆ.        _Dipterocarpus turbinatus_, Gaertn. (_D. Indicus_, Bedd.; _D. Mayapis_,  Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Mayapis_, Tag.; _Gurjun_, _Kanyin_, Indo-Eng.    Uses.--This tree yields an oleo resin, used in medicine and known  under the name of _bálsamo de gurjun_. Other species of _Dipterocarpus_  (_D. alatus_, Roxb.; _D. incanus_, Roxb.; _D. trinervis_, Bl., etc.,  etc.) produce the same substance. Balsam of Gurjun is a stimulant  of the mucous membranes, especially those of the genito-urinary  tract, and is diuretic. It is also indicated in bronchial catarrh  and as a local application in ulcer. The first to recommend the use  of gurjun as a substitute for copaiba was Sir W. O'Shaughnessy in  1838, and in 1852 this property was confirmed by Waring with highly  satisfactory results. Dr. Enderson of Glasgow employed it in cases  that received no benefit from copaiba, giving a teaspoonful t. i. d. in  emulsion. Dr. Rean also classed it as equal to copaiba in efficiency.    The daily dose ranges from 5-20 grams, in liquid or pill.    The following is an excellent formula for an emulsion:              Cinnamon water                  125 grams.          Sodium carbonate, crystals        2 grams.          Balsam of gurjun                 25 grams.          Syrup of gum                     25 grams.          Sulphuric ether                   2 grams.            Mix and shake.      Dose.--6-12 large spoonfuls each day, for the declining stage of  gonorrhoea.    In Burmah they extract the balsam by the following method: A large  hole is cut in the trunk of the tree and a fire is built in this  cavity and kept up till the wood of the trunk begins to burn, by  which time the oleo resin has collected in abundance in the segments  of bamboo placed to receive it. When the exudate diminishes, fire is  again placed in the cavity and one tree may tolerate 2, 3 or even 4  of these cavities. The exudate on standing separates into 2 parts;  a solid called \"guad\" which forms the lower layer, and a supernatant  liquid which is the balsam. It is dense, viscid and very fluorescent;  opaque and gray-green by reflected light. It has an odor similar to  that of copaiba, is bitter and aromatic. Its density is 0.964. It  is soluble in benzine, in bisulphuret of carbon, chloroform, the  essential oils and less so in ether and acetic acid. It becomes turbid  and coagulates if it be kept at 100° for some time and it solidifies  at 200°, while copaiba remains liquid at this temperature.    A specimen of the balsam examined by Flückiger consisted of 54.44  parts semifluid resin and 45.56 volatile material. Upon distillation  it yields an essential oil, of slight odor, straw-colored; formula  C_20_H_32_ (Werner). If purified its density is 0.915. It is soluble  in amylic alcohol, scarcely so in absolute alcohol. Hydrochloric acid  colors it a beautiful blue. The resin remaining after distillation,  dissolved in alcohol 0.838 with the addition of ammonia, yields as a  precipitate a crystalline acid (gurjunic acid), C_44_H_64_O_8_, soluble  in alcohol 0.838, in ether, in benzol and bisulphide of carbon. It  melts at 220° (Werner), solidifies at 180° and is decomposed at 260°.    Botanical Description.--A very large, handsome tree with leaves  about 5' in length, alternate, ovate, broad and lanceolate, entire,  glabrous and membranaceous. Petioles very short. Flowers terminal,  paniculate, handsome, fragrant. Calyx free, 5 lanceolate sepals, of  which 2 are slightly longer than the others. Corolla, 5 yellow oblong  petals longer than the sepals. Stamens numerous, attached to the  receptacle. Filaments very short. Anthers of 2 divisions each ending  in a long beard. Ovary half buried in the receptacle. A single thick  style. Three simple stigmas. Seed vessel of 3 cells, seeds in pairs.    Habitat.--In Luzon in the mountains of Tala, Angat and San Mateo;  in Mindanao, Paragua, Balabac and Negros. Blooms in June.          MALVACEÆ.    Mallow Family.        _Sida carpinifolia_, L. (_S. acuta_, Burm.; _S. stipulata_, Cav.;  _S. frutescens_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Wawalisan_, _Eskobanghaba_, _Pamalis_, _Higot-balato_,  _Mamalis_, Tag., Vis., Pam.    Uses.--The root is emollient and bitter. The decoction is  used as a lotion for ulcers, and internally as a sudorific and  tonic-astringent. The physicians of India prescribe the powdered root  with milk for fevers and for nervous and urinary diseases. The leaves  are used locally in ophthalmia.    The juice of the root is employed as a wash for all kinds of  sores and ulcers and the juice of the entire plant is given for  spermatorrhoea. After experimenting with the root, the compilers of  the Bengal Dispensatory announced their uncertainty as to whether  or not it possessed antipyretic properties; however, they pronounce  it diaphoretic, an exciter of the appetite and an excellent bitter  tonic.
