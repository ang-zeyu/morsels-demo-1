The  wounded stag, and the close prisoner of a Provincial Government,  experience similar treatment.\"[15]    The summer heat, as before mentioned, had been excessive. No rain had  fallen for weeks until just before the opening of the assizes, when  there had been three days of damp, cool weather. During these three days  the prisoner's strength had rallied wonderfully, and he had been able to  prepare a written defence, as well as a written protest against the  legality of his trial, in case of a hostile verdict. But the exertion  had been too much for him in his enfeebled condition, and, as though to  add to his miseries, the heat had become more intolerable than before.  He had not known how utterly his nerves were shattered until his case  had been called for trial, and he had been placed in the prisoners'  dock. Hot and stifling as was the air of the court-room, it was balm  itself when compared with the vitiated element which he had long been  forced to breathe. The stimulus was too great, and he was no longer  master of himself. To quote his own words, he became rampant with the  fresh air, and was reduced to imbecility at the very moment when he  specially needed strength, patience and recollection. Such was his  condition when Mr. Attorney-General rose from his seat and proceeded to  lay bare the prisoner's unspeakable enormities. It had been determined  that no attempt should be made to convict him of sedition, and that the  only charge to be pressed against him should be his refusal to leave the  Province. The indictment, however, was read and commented upon,  doubtless for the purpose of influencing the minds of the audience. It  charged, with wearisome iteration and reiteration, that he, the said  Robert Gourlay, being a seditious and ill-disposed person, and  contriving and maliciously intending the peace and tranquillity of our  lord the King within the Province of Upper Canada to disquiet and  disturb, and to excite discontent and sedition among his Majesty's liege  subjects of this Province--and so forth, and so forth, to the end of the  tedious and tautological chapter. The patriotic and disinterested  conduct of Dickson and Claus, in performing the imperative but  unpleasant duty of committing their personal friend to jail, lest he  should undermine the loyalty of the people, was commented upon with  periphrastic eloquence. When the official inquiry was put to the  prisoner: \"How say you, Robert Gourlay, are you guilty or not guilty?\"  he instinctively replied \"Not guilty.\" Then came the next query: \"Are  you ready for your trial?\" Ready for his trial, indeed! when his  helpless condition was apparent to everybody who could catch a glimpse  of his tottering frame and his vacant, expressionless face. The  unmeaning sound which issued from his lips was taken for an affirmative,  and the farce of an impartial investigation proceeded with.    During the whole of these proceedings the prisoner stood like one amazed  and confounded; as one who gropes blindly in the dark for what he cannot  find. From the various hints scattered here and there throughout his  numerous writings, we are able to form some idea of what he underwent  during that trying ordeal. His imagination had been rendered more lively  by weakness and prostration of body, and he was so stimulated by the  change of air from his cell to the court-room that his sensations were  chiefly those of a vague and unreasoning delight--delight at the  prospect of freedom; delight at the prospect of once more enjoying the  luxury of heaven's sunlight unimpeded by the bars of a prison cell; of  running rampant through the land, and feeling upon his sunken cheeks the  deliciously invigorating air of the open fields. His high spirit had  been effectually tamed by that rigid, excruciating torture of close  confinement during the dog days, with no other companion than despair.  By this time personal liberty and fresh air seemed to him the only  things greatly to be desired. He was cognizant of a sensation of  thankfulness that his trial had come on at last, even though it should  result in his banishment. He rejoiced that he should even thus be set at  liberty from his horrible situation.[16] He longed to feel the tide of  human life ebbing and flowing around him, and to feel that he himself  was not a mere drone in the hive. During the progress of the trial,  though he was oblivious of most that was going on in the court-room,  memory and fancy were keenly alert, and he rapidly lived over again many  episodes of his past life. The dead and gone years rose up before him  like the scenes of a rapidly-shifting panorama, even as the past is said  to arise before the mental vision of those lying on beds of pain, just  before the great mystery of the grave is unfolded to their view.  Subjects and scenes long forgotten or seldom remembered presented  themselves. There was the little Fifeshire school, with its umbrageous  playground, where he had been a merry laughing lad, and where Dominie  Angus had given him his first taste of ferule and Fotherup. There was  the patched portrait of Cardinal Beaton, in St. Mary's College, at which  he and his friend John Dean had been wont to gaze with rapt admiration  in the old days left so far behind. There was that odd adventure among  the Mendip Hills, during his professional peregrination through  Somersetshire more than a dozen years before, and upon which he could  not remember that he had bestowed a single thought since his arrival in  Canada. There, too, was the drunken type-setter from Bristol, who had  taught him the technical marks to be used in making corrections for the  press, and whom he had neither seen nor thought of since the publication  of his pamphlet in which be had portrayed the sufferings of Bet Bennam  and Mary Bacon. Who shall say what other scenes, sad or mirthful,  presented themselves among his \"thick-coming fancies\"? Possibly he  recalled the high hopes of his boyhood, when he thirsted to better the  condition of the poor, and was almost persuaded that he had been sent  into the world expressly to guard their interests against the exactions  of grasping landlords. Visions, too, may have arisen before him of his  beautiful Wiltshire farm, where the modest daisies peeped above the  grass, and the joyous lark sang from the meadow; where he had once been  so happy in the companionship of his fond wife and little ones, who at  this moment waited in longing expectation for tidings from the absent  husband and father. Perchance also he called to mind, at that crisis,  his little dead daughter, who had blossomed and faded among the green  glades of Wily, and over whose grave the parson of the parish had  refused to read the services of the Church.[17] The poor babe had died  unchristened, and under such circumstances the rubric forbade the  solemnization of funeral rites.    From all such musings he was recalled by the voice of Chief Justice  Powell, demanding if he had aught to say ere the sentence of the court  should be pronounced upon him. The sentence of the court! For the best  part of two hours he had been wool-gathering, and the words beat upon  his brain without arousing any just appreciation of their significance.  He now once more awoke to the fact that he was on his trial, but he  could not grasp the potentialities of his situation, nor could he for  the life of him recall the precise nature of the offence with which he  had been charged. He did, however, realize that the jury had returned a  verdict to the effect that he had been guilty of refusing to leave the  Province, pursuant to the order served upon him. By a desperate effort  he managed to rally his senses sufficiently to remember that he had been  accused of being a seditious person, though whether the accusation had  been made yesterday, or the day before, or half a century ago, he was  wholly unaware. Turning towards the jury-box, he enquired of the nearest  occupant whether he had been found guilty of sedition. Suddenly it  flashed across him that he had prepared a defence, together with a  written protest against the anticipated verdict. But by no mental  exertion of which he was capable could he remember what he had done  with the defence, nor could he call to mind the word \"protest,\" although  at that moment he had the written one in his pocket. After a moment's  struggle to remember what he wished to say, he found himself hopelessly  befogged, and abandoned the attempt. Then, to the amazement of all who  heard him, he burst out into a loud, strident peal of unmeaning,  maniacal laughter--laughter which had no spice of merriment in it, and  which was a mere spontaneous effort of nature to relieve the strain upon  the shattered nerves. Bench, bar, jury and spectators stared aghast. Such  laughter sounded not only incongruous, but sinister, ominous. It was  suggestive of the expiring wail of a lost soul. It was more eloquent  than any mere words could have been, and spoke with most miraculous  organ. Over more than one heart there crept a sort of premonition that a  dread reckoning must sometime arrive for that day's work: that Eternal  Justice would sooner or later exact a fit penalty for the cruel  perversion of right which was then and there being consummated. It would  be interesting to know what, at that particular moment, were the  innermost sensations of William Dickson and William Claus, both of whom  sat within a few feet of their victim, and both of whom had repeatedly  received offices of kindness at his hands.    Strange to say, the miserable man's memory was merely suspended, and he  afterwards recalled with much clearness the thoughts and reflections  which passed through his mind during that delirium of more than two  hours. He even remembered "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22136"],[0,"The Book-Hunter (#7)"],[1," _obliged_ to communicate it.         \"Finding, on inquiry, that there would be no opportunity of being       examined after the 14th, I will allow I was a little startled, but       still stuck fast, and had a sort of feeling I would be able to       pass, as I do not like setting about what I cannot perform.         \"Proceeding in my labours, I gathered confidence, and when the day       came thought it would be rather hard were I rejected. There were       four examined at the same time, and being before myself, I had to       stand their statements of the difficulty and minuteness of the       questions, and they stared not a little when I told them I had       studied the subject for a fortnight and two days; for previous to       that time I had been engaged in the _History_ of Roman Law at       college, and had commenced with the Principles. After the first       question I felt myself secure; yet I will allow I felt a little       easy (_i.e. relieved_) when each of the examiners shook hands with       me, and told me I had given perfect satisfaction.         \"The librarian tells me some are rejected in the Civil Law trials,       but _none_ in the Scotch Law, for which I must next year be       prepared. I hope the saving will counter-balance the trouble of       raising the money. I believe I shall enclose you my acknowledgment       for the L200 (the L13 goes to the library, or something of that       sort, which, though rather apocryphal in my nomenclature, shows the       destination of the money). Tell the children[7] if they will write       I will answer them soon, and enclose them something. Pray remember       me to Mr Alcock, and repeat my sense of obligation to him.

BEGINNING OF LITERARY LIFE.    _Particulars regarding passing of Civil Law trial--Letters containing  account of first years in Edinburgh and beginning of literary  life--First marriage--Wife's death--Publications during married life and  widowhood--Political Economy._      If genius is to be defined as the power of taking a great deal of  trouble, Dr Burton certainly possessed genius. His most remarkable power  was that of mental labour. It did not seem to fatigue or excite him. In  his best years his capability for mental work was limited only by the  need of food and sleep, and he could reduce these needs to a minimum,  and apparently without any future reaction.    He has told the writer that he did not go to bed at all during the  fortnight's preparation for his Civil Law trial, described in the last  chapter, but worked continuously, day and night, living almost entirely  on strong tea and coffee. After his examination was over, he felt no  actual fatigue or discomfort. He went to bed at his usual hour, but  slept till the night of the second day was falling, a period of wellnigh  forty-eight hours. He sustained no injury to health, and became entitled  to style himself Advocate.    He never had much practice at the bar; and the need of earning a  livelihood first led him to literary publication.    The two letters next offered refer to the following years of his life,  when the little family was reunited in Edinburgh. Their mother's absence  on a visit to relations in Aberdeen gave occasion for the letters.         \"3 HOWARD PLACE, SOUTH,       _14th July 1833_.         \"MY DEAR MOTHER,--I take the opportunity of Spalding's[8] going to       Aberdeen to write you a few lines. James received the other day two       letters--one from you, and one from Mary.         [Footnote 8: William Spalding, author of a History of English       Literature and other works; a close friend till his too early       death.]         \"The latter mentioned you had sent a letter for me, which has not       yet arrived. I hope to receive it soon, or that you will write me       another, giving a more particular account of your health than the       letters to James have stated.         \"I am at all events glad to hear yourself say you are not worse,       and hope that a little such exertion and variety as you must meet       will tend to strengthen you. We have been going on just as usual;       perhaps I have been a little more idle than usual during the past       week, being the last of the session. I have had one or two friends       in to dine, but did not give them very splendid entertainments.       James is most particular in his care of the cat, and we both prowl       about occasionally looking for gooseberries.         \"I caught a hedgehog the other evening, which has been let loose in       the garden. I have been unable to discover his place of abode, but       we sometimes meet him taking an evening stroll through the walks.       He is an object of great interest to the cat, whose curiosity,       however, he seems decidedly to baffle....         \"I am sorry to hear Robertson is unwell, but I suppose he is able       to write, and he must really be at the trouble of sending me a       letter before I can trouble myself farther about his trunks.         \"I shall be engaged to-morrow and next day in the Justiciary Court,       and shall be otherwise very busy during the rest of the month....         \"By the way, could you ascertain anything about the next Circuit?       You might perhaps send a note to Daniel (Alexander Daniel, Esq.,       advocate, Farquhar's Court, Upperkirkgate), asking him to call on       you and see if he can get me a case or two....         \"With kindest remembrances to grand-aunt and Mrs Brown.--My dear       mother, your affectionate son,         \"JOHN HILL BURTON.\"    The fondness for animals and for gooseberries were lifelong tastes. That  for animals did not extend to taking much trouble about them; but Dr  Burton had none of a student's nervousness about slight noises or  interruptions. He would have thought a house dull without the sounds of  birds or other pets in it, and one of his favourite amusements was to  watch the ways of animals. He had examples, in his acquaintance among  dogs and cats, of heart and conscience in the two species respectively,  too trivial for notice here.    Dr Burton has stated in the letters previously quoted some of the  studies which he pursued at college in Edinburgh. His contribution to  Mrs Gordon's 'Life of Professor Wilson' furnishes a lively picture of  college life and experience in Edinburgh. He attended the course of the  late Sir William Hamilton, and gained some distinction in the study of  moral philosophy and metaphysics, so much that his appointment as  assistant and successor to Sir William was seriously considered by  himself and others. Had he become Professor of Logic and Metaphysics, he  would no doubt have discharged the duties of the situation well. At that  time of his life, great versatility, along with extraordinary diligence,  was the chief characteristic of his mind. In later years he did not  pursue the study of mental science.    Before the period in Dr Burton's life which we have now reached, he had  contributed many articles to the 'Aberdeen Magazine,' published by his  kind old friend Lewis Smith. These were lately collected and republished  by Mr Smith; but, to judge from such specimens as the writer has seen,  they are not, on the whole, of a character to increase Dr Burton's  present reputation. He seems to have tried his hand at every kind of  composition--romance, drama, poetry. In the last mentioned he had most  success. His sentimental verses are pretty. His romances are so much  crowded with incident as to be almost unintelligible. He was true to his  own peculiar taste in novels. If a novel was recommended to him he used  to inquire, \"Is there plenty of murder in it?\" He disliked almost  equally the philosophical novel, and the domestic or social novel. Of  the former he used to say he preferred to read _either_ philosophy or  fiction; he could not endure them combined. To hear even a sentence of  the best social or domestic novel read irritated him intolerably. He  would ask, \"How any one could feel interest in the talk of a set of  ordinary silly people, such as one must meet with every day. It was bad  enough to hear them talk when one could not help it.\"    Quantities of early works, never printed, are still preserved by his  family. The habit of writing--_not_ letter-writing--seems to have begun  as soon as he could use a pen, and while his orthography--never a strong  point--was excessively weak. \"The Rosted Baron\" remains a popular work  in a small circle. It is a tale, crowded, as its title indicates, with  blood and flames. The idea may have been taken from the burning of  Frendraught. It was written when Dr Burton was quite a boy, and is now  one of a heap of manuscripts in a childish hand on very yellow paper  remaining in his repositories.         \"3 HOWARD PLACE, SOUTH,       _24th July 1833_.         \"MY DEAR MOTHER,-- ... I was extremely glad to receive your letter       by post this morning, showing me that you are able to go about, and       that you are enjoying yourself as much as possible. James[9] and I       have been getting on very well and very comfortably.         [Footnote 9: Dr Burton's eight years"]]]
