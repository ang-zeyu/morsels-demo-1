These are the signs, with the primitive characters that  distinguish them: the Ram [Aries], the Bull [Taurus], the Twins  [Gemini], the Crab [Cancer], the Lion [Leo], the Virgin [Virgo], the  Balance [Libra], the Scorpion [Scorpio], the Archer [Sagittarius], the  Goat [Capricorn], the Water-Carrier [Aquarius], the Fishes [Pisces]. The  sign [Aries] represents the horns of the Ram, [Taurus] the head of the  Bull, and so on.    If you will now follow me into the Houses of the Sun you will readily  recognize them again, provided you have a clear picture of the principal  stars of the Northern Heavens. First, you see the Ram, the initial sign  of the Zodiac; because at the epoch at which the actual Zodiac was  fixed, the Sun entered this sign at the vernal equinox, and the equator  crossed the ecliptic at this point. This constellation, in which the  horns of the Ram (third magnitude) are the brightest, is situated  between Andromeda and the Pleiades. Two thousand years ago, the Ram was  regarded as the symbol of spring; but owing to the secular movement of  the precession of the equinoxes, the Sun is no longer there on March 21:  he is in the Fishes.    To the left, or east of the Ram, we find the Bull, the head of which  forms a triangle in which burns Aldebaran, of first magnitude, a  magnificent red star that marks the right eye; and the Hyades,  scintillating pale and trembling, on its forehead. The timid Pleiades,  as we have seen, veil themselves on the shoulder of the Bull--a  captivating cluster, of which six stars can be counted with the unaided  eye, while several hundred are discovered with the telescope.    Next the Twins. They are easily recognized by the two fine stars,  [alpha] and [beta], of first magnitude, which mark their heads, and  immortalize Castor and Pollux, the sons of Jupiter, celebrated for their  indissoluble friendship.    Cancer, the Crab, is the least important sign of the Zodiac. It is  distinguished only by five stars of fourth and fifth magnitudes,  situated below the line of Castor and Pollux, and by a pale cluster  called Praesepe, the Beehive.    The Lion next approaches, superb in his majesty. At his heart is a  gorgeous star of first magnitude, [alpha] or Regulus. This figure forms  a grand trapezium of four stars on the celestial sphere.    The Virgin exhibits a splendid star of first magnitude; this is Spica,  which with Regulus and Arcturus, form a triangle by which this  constellation can be recognized.    The Balance follows the Virgin. Its scales, marked by two stars of  second magnitude, are situated a little to the East of Spica.    We next come to the eighth constellation of the Zodiac, which is one of  the most beautiful of this belt of stars. Antares, a red star of first  magnitude, occupies the heart of the venomous and accursed Scorpion. It  is situated on the prolongation of a line joining Regulus to Spica, and  forms with Vega of the Lyre, and Arcturus of the Herdsman, a great  isosceles triangle, of which this latter star is the apex.    The Scorpion, held to be a sign of ill luck, has been prejudicial to the  Archer, which follows it, and traces an oblique trapezium in the sky, a  little to the east of Antares. These two southernmost constellations  never rise much above the horizon for France and England. In fable, the  Archer is Chiron, the preceptor of Jason, Achilles and AEsculapius.    Capricorn lies to the south of Altair, on the prolongation of a line  from the Lyre to the Eagle. It is hardly noticeable save for the stars  [alpha] and [beta] of third magnitude, which scintillate on its  forehead.    The Water-Carrier pours his streams toward the horizon. He is not rich  in stars, exhibiting only three of third magnitude that form a very  flattened triangle.    Lastly the Fishes, concluding sign of the Zodiac, are found to the  south of Andromeda and Pegasus. Save for [alpha], of third magnitude,  this constellation consists of small stars that are hardly visible.    These twelve zodiacal constellations will be recognized on examining the  chart (Figs. 10-11).    We must now visit the stars of the Southern Heavens, some of which are  equally deserving of admiration.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--The Constellations of the Zodiac: summer and  autumn; Capricorn, Archer, Scorpion, Balance, Virgin, Lion.]    It should in the first place be noted that the signs of the Zodiac and  the Southern Constellations are not, like those which are circumpolar,  perpetually visible at all periods of the year. Their visibility depends  on the time of year and the hour of the night.[4]    In order to admire the fine constellations of the North, as described  above, we have only to open our windows on a clear summer's evening, or  walk round the garden in the mysterious light of these inaccessible  suns, while we look up at the immense fields in which each star is like  the head of a celestial spear.    But the summer is over, autumn is upon us, and then, too soon, comes  winter clothed in hoar-frost. The days are short and cold, dark and  dreary; but as a compensation the night is much longer, and adorns  herself with her most beautiful jewels, offering us the contemplation of  her inexhaustible treasures.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--The Constellations of the Zodiac: winter and  spring; Crab, Twins, Bull, Ram, Fishes, Water-Carrier.]    First, let us do homage to the magnificent Orion, most splendid of all  the constellations: he advances like a colossal giant, and confronts the  Bull.    This constellation appears about midnight in November, in the  south-eastern Heavens; toward eleven o'clock in December and January,  due south; about ten in February, in the south-east; about nine in  March, and about eight in April, in the west; and then sets below our  horizon.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Orion and his celestial companions.]    It is indisputably the most striking figure in the sky, and with the  Great Bear, the most ancient in history, the first that was noticed:  both are referred to in the ancient texts of China, Chaldea, and Egypt.    Eight principal stars delineate its outline; two are of the first  magnitude, five of the second, and one of the third (Fig. 12). The most  brilliant are Betelgeuse ([alpha]) and Rigel ([beta]): the former  marking the right shoulder of the Colossus as it faces us; the second  the left foot. The star on the left shoulder is [gamma] or Bellatrix, of  second magnitude; that of the right foot, [chi], is almost of the third.  Three stars of second magnitude placed obliquely at equal distances from  each other, the first or highest of which marks the position of the  equatorial line, indicate the Belt or Girdle. These stars, known as the  Three Kings, and by country people as the Rake, assist greatly in the  recognition of this fine constellation.    A little below the second star of the Belt, a large white patch, like a  band of fog, the apparent dimensions of which are equal to that of the  lunar disk, is visible to the unaided eye: this is the Nebula of Orion,  one of the most magnificent in the entire Heavens. It was discovered in  1656 by Huyghens, who counted twelve stars in the pale cloud. Since that  date it has been constantly studied and photographed by its many  admirers, while the giant eye of the telescope discovers in it to-day an  innumerable multitude of little stars which reveal the existence of an  entire universe in this region.    Orion is not merely the most imposing of the celestial figures; it is  also the richest in sidereal wonders. Among these, it exhibits the most  complex of all the multiple systems known to us: that of the star  [theta] situated in the celebrated nebula just mentioned. This marvelous  star, viewed through a powerful telescope, breaks up into six suns,  forming a most remarkable stellar group.    This region is altogether one of the most brilliant in the entire  firmament. We must no longer postpone our homage to the brightest star  in the sky, the magnificent Sirius, which shines on the left below  Orion: it returns every year toward the end of November. This marvelous  star, of dazzling brilliancy, is the first, [alpha], in the  constellation of the Great Dog, which forms a quadrilateral, the base of  which is adjacent to a triangle erected from the horizon.    When astronomers first endeavored to determine the distance of the  stars, Sirius, which attracted all eyes to its burning fires, was the  particular object of attention. After long observation, they succeeded  in determining its distance as 92 trillion kilometers (57 trillion  miles). Light, that radiates through space at a velocity of 300,000  kilometers (186,000 miles) per second, takes no less than ten years to  reach us from this sun, which, nevertheless, is one of our neighbors.    The Little Dog, in which Procyon ([alpha], of first magnitude) shines  out, is above its big brother. With the exception of [alpha], it has no  bright stars.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Winter Constellations.]    Lastly, toward the southern horizon, we must notice the Hydra, Eridanus,  the Whale, the Southern Fish, the Ship, and the Centaur. This last  constellation, while invisible to our latitudes, contains the star that  is nearest to the Earth, [alpha], of first magnitude, the distance of  which is 40 trillion kilometers (25 trillion miles).    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Spring Constellations.]    The feet of the Centaur touch the Southern Cross, which is always  invisible to us, and a little farther down the Southern Pole reigns  over the icy desert of the antarctic regions.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Summer Constellations.]    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Autumn Constellations.]    In order to complete the preceding descriptions, we subjoin four charts  representing the aspect of the starry heavens during the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2527"],[0,"The Sorrows of Young Werther (#7)"],[1,"feelings by catching up the child and  kissing her heartily. She was frightened, and began to cry. \"You should  not do that,\" said Charlotte: I felt perplexed. \"Come, Jane,\" she  continued, taking her hand, and leading her down the steps again, \"it  is no matter: wash yourself quickly in the fresh water.\" I stood and  watched them; and when I saw the little dear rubbing her cheeks with  her wet hands, in full belief that all the impurities contracted from my  ugly beard would be washed off by the miraculous water, and how, though  Charlotte said it would do, she continued still to wash with all her  might, as though she thought too much were better than too little, I  assure you, Wilhelm, I never attended a baptism with greater reverence;  and, when Charlotte came up from the well, I could have prostrated  myself as before the prophet of an Eastern nation.    In the evening I would not resist telling the story to a person who,  I thought, possessed some natural feeling, because he was a man of  understanding. But what a mistake I made. He maintained it was very  wrong of Charlotte, that we should not deceive children, that such  things occasioned countless mistakes and superstitions, from which we  were bound to protect the young. It occurred to me then, that this very  man had been baptised only a week before; so I said nothing further,  but maintained the justice of my own convictions. We should deal with  children as God deals with us, we are happiest under the influence of  innocent delusions.    JULY 8.    What a child is man that he should be so solicitous about a look! What a  child is man! We had been to Walheim: the ladies went in a carriage;  but during our walk I thought I saw in Charlotte's dark eyes--I am a  fool--but forgive me! you should see them,--those eyes.--However, to be  brief (for my own eyes are weighed down with sleep), you must know,  when the ladies stepped into their carriage again, young W. Seldstadt,  Andran, and I were standing about the door. They are a merry set of  fellows, and they were all laughing and joking together. I watched  Charlotte's eyes. They wandered from one to the other; but they did not  light on me, on me, who stood there motionless, and who saw nothing but  her! My heart bade her a thousand times adieu, but she noticed me not.  The carriage drove off; and my eyes filled with tears. I looked after  her: suddenly I saw Charlotte's bonnet leaning out of the window, and  she turned to look back, was it at me? My dear friend, I know not; and  in this uncertainty I find consolation. Perhaps she turned to look at  me. Perhaps! Good-night--what a child I am!    JULY 10.    You should see how foolish I look in company when her name is mentioned,  particularly when I am asked plainly how I like her. How I like her!  I detest the phrase. What sort of creature must he be who merely liked  Charlotte, whose whole heart and senses were not entirely absorbed by  her. Like her! Some one asked me lately how I liked Ossian.    JULY 11.    Madame M--is very ill. I pray for her recovery, because Charlotte shares  my sufferings. I see her occasionally at my friend's house, and to-day  she has told me the strangest circumstance. Old M--is a covetous,  miserly fellow, who has long worried and annoyed the poor lady sadly;  but she has borne her afflictions patiently. A few days ago, when the  physician informed us that her recovery was hopeless, she sent for  her husband (Charlotte was present), and addressed him thus: \"I have  something to confess, which, after my decease, may occasion trouble  and confusion. I have hitherto conducted your household as frugally and  economically as possible, but you must pardon me for having defrauded  you for thirty years. At the commencement of our married life, you  allowed a small sum for the wants of the kitchen, and the other  household expenses. When our establishment increased and our property  grew larger, I could not persuade you to increase the weekly allowance  in proportion: in short, you know, that, when our wants were greatest,  you required me to supply everything with seven florins a week. I  took the money from you without an observation, but made up the weekly  deficiency from the money-chest; as nobody would suspect your wife of  robbing the household bank. But I have wasted nothing, and should have  been content to meet my eternal Judge without this confession, if she,  upon whom the management of your establishment will devolve after my  decease, would be free from embarrassment upon your insisting that the  allowance made to me, your former wife, was sufficient.\"    I talked with Charlotte of the inconceivable manner in which men allow  themselves to be blinded; how any one could avoid suspecting some  deception, when seven florins only were allowed to defray expenses  twice as great. But I have myself known people who believed, without  any visible astonishment, that their house possessed the prophet's  never-failing cruse of oil.    JULY 13.    No, I am not deceived. In her dark eyes I read a genuine interest in me  and in my fortunes. Yes, I feel it; and I may believe my own heart which  tells me--dare I say it?--dare I pronounce the divine words?--that she  loves me!    That she loves me! How the idea exalts me in my own eyes! And, as you  can understand my feelings, I may say to you, how I honour myself since  she loves me!    Is this presumption, or is it a consciousness of the truth? I do not  know a man able to supplant me in the heart of Charlotte; and yet when  she speaks of her betrothed with so much warmth and affection, I feel  like the soldier who has been stripped of his honours and titles, and  deprived of his sword.    JULY 16.    How my heart beats when by accident I touch her finger, or my feet meet  hers under the table! I draw back as if from a furnace; but a secret  force impels me forward again, and my senses become disordered.  Her innocent, unconscious heart never knows what agony these little  familiarities inflict upon me. Sometimes when we are talking she lays  her hand upon mine, and in the eagerness of conversation comes closer to  me, and her balmy breath reaches my lips,--when I feel as if lightning  had struck me, and that I could sink into the earth. And yet, Wilhelm,  with all this heavenly confidence,--if I know myself, and should ever  dare--you understand me. No, no! my heart is not so corrupt, it is weak,  weak enough but is not that a degree of corruption?    She is to me a sacred being. All passion is still in her presence: I  cannot express my sensations when I am near her. I feel as if my soul  beat in every nerve of my body. There is a melody which she plays on the  piano with angelic skill,--so simple is it, and yet so spiritual! It is  her favourite air; and, when she plays the first note, all pain, care,  and sorrow disappear from me in a moment.    I believe every word that is said of the magic of ancient music. How her  simple song enchants me! Sometimes, when I am ready to commit suicide,  she sings that air; and instantly the gloom and madness which hung over  me are dispersed, and I breathe freely again.    JULY 18.    Wilhelm, what is the world to our hearts without love? What is a  magic-lantern without light? You have but to kindle the flame within,  and the brightest figures shine on the white wall; and, if love only  show us fleeting shadows, we are yet happy, when, like mere children, we  behold them, and are transported with the splendid phantoms. I have not  been able to see Charlotte to-day. I was prevented by company from which  I could not disengage myself. What was to be done? I sent my servant to  her house, that I might at least see somebody to-day who had been near  her. Oh, the impatience with which I waited for his return! the joy with  which I welcomed him! I should certainly have caught him in my arms, and  kissed him, if I had not been ashamed.    It is said that the Bonona stone, when placed in the sun, attracts the  rays, and for a time appears luminous in the dark. So was it with me  and this servant. The idea that Charlotte's eyes had dwelt on his  countenance, his cheek, his very apparel, endeared them all inestimably  to me, so that at the moment I would not have parted from him for a  thousand crowns. His presence made me so happy! Beware of laughing at  me, Wilhelm. Can that be a delusion which makes us happy?    JULY 19.    \"I shall see her today!\" I exclaim with delight, when I rise in the  morning, and look out with gladness of heart at the bright, beautiful  sun. \"I shall see her today!\" And then I have no further wish to form:  all, all is included in that one thought.    JULY 20.    I cannot assent to your proposal that I should accompany the ambassador  to ------. I do not love subordination; and we all know that he is  a rough, disagreeable person to be connected with. You say my mother  wishes me to be employed. I could not help laughing at that. Am I not  sufficiently employed? And is it not in reality the same, whether  I shell peas or count lentils? The world runs on from one folly to  another; and the man who, solely from regard to the opinion of others,  and without any wish or necessity of his own, toils after gold, honour,  or any other phantom, is no better than a fool.    JULY 24.    You insist so much on my not neglecting my drawing, that it would be as  well for me to say nothing as to confess how little I have lately done.    I never felt happier, I never understood nature better, even down to the  veriest stem or smallest blade of grass; and yet I am unable to express  myself: my powers of execution are so weak, everything seems to swim  and float before me, so that I cannot make a clear, bold outline. But  I fancy I should succeed better if I had some clay or wax to model. I  shall try, if this state of mind continues much longer, and will take to  modelling, if I only knead dough.    I have commenced Charlotte's portrait "]]]
