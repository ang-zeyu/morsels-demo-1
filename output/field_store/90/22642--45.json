The stretcher should have its ends  shouldered on the two edges so as to make a 2-1/2-in. tenon. Allow the  tenons to extend 1-1/8 in. beyond the cross rail and cut mortises in  these tenons for the keys.    All projecting tenons, as well as the tops and bottoms of the posts,  should be chamfered about 1/8 in. For the seat, screw cleats to the  insides of the rails and place a platform of thin boards so that its top  surface is 1/2 in. below the top of the rails.    A cushion can be made, as shown in the photograph, by lacing with  leather thongs two pieces of Spanish leather cut to proper length and  width. When nearly laced fill with any of the common upholsterer's  fillings.    [Illustration: Details of Parts of Chair]    For a brown stain, dissolve by boiling in 4 oz. of water, extract of  logwood the size of a walnut. Apply hot and repeat until the desired  color is obtained. Stains can be bought ready prepared, however, and are  quite satisfactory. Finish by applying several coats of wax.          HOW TO MAKE A SETTEE      This handsome piece of mission furniture is designed to be made up in  three different pieces as desired, the only changes necessary being in  the length of the one front and the two back rails. The settee can be  made into a three-cushion length by adding the length of another cushion  to the dimensions of the one front and two back rails. A companion piece  chair can be made by using suitable length rails to admit only one  cushion. The following stock list of materials ordered mill-planed and  sandpapered will be sufficient to make up the settee as illustrated. Oak  is the most suitable wood which can be finished in either mission or a  dark golden oak.       3 rails 1 by 4 by 52-1/4 in.     4 end rails 1 by 4 by 24-1/4 in.     4 posts 2-1/4 in. square by 34-1/2 in.    13 slats 1/2 by 5 by 21-1/4 in.     2 cleats 1 in. square by 51 in.    All the rails are mortised into the posts for a depth of 5/8 in., also  the slats are mortised 5/8 in. into the rails. The material list gives  the exact dimensions for the rails and slats as they will not need to be  squared for entering the mortises, provided you are careful to get all  lengths cut to dimensions. When cutting the mortises take care to get  them square and clean. The posts have 1/2 in. extra added for squaring  up and cutting the corners sloping on the top ends.    The joints are all put together with glue. Nails can be driven into the  posts intersecting the tenons of the rails on the inside, as they will  not show and will help to make the settee more solid.    [Illustration: A Complete Two-Cushion Settee]    [Illustration: Details of a Mission Settee]    The cushions can be made with or without springs as desired. If made  without springs, 15 slats must be provided in the material list 1/2 in.  thick, 2 in. wide and 24 in. long to be placed on the cleats fastened  to the inside of each bottom rail. The two cleats are fastened one on  each inside of the front and back rails with screws. The location as to  height of these cleats will depend upon the kind of cushions used. The  parts necessary to make the cushions with springs are as follows:       4 pieces 1 by 2-1/2 by 26 in.     8 pieces 1 by 2-1/2 by 24 in.     4 pieces 1 by 2-1/2 by 22 in.    32 8-in. springs.     2 pieces leather about 29 by 31 in.    [Illustration: Details of the Cushion]    An open box is made from two 26-in. and two 22-in. pieces, and across  the bottom are mortised and set in four 24-in. pieces to form slats on  which to set the springs. The tops of the springs are tied or anchored  with stout cords running in both directions and fastened to the inside  of the pieces forming the open box. These should be tied in such manner  as to hold each spring so it cannot slip over and come in contact with  another spring.    Roan or pebbled leather are very popular for cushions for this style of  furniture. The leather is drawn over the springs and tacked to the  outside of the open box frame. When complete the cushions are set in  loose on the cleats, which should, in this case, be placed about 1 in.  from the top of the rails.          HOW TO MAKE A PYROGRAPHER'S TABLE      [Illustration: Convenient Pyrographer's Table]    Any pyrographer will appreciate the construction of the table and  cabinet as illustrated. Anyone doing burnt wood work will know the  annoyance of building up a steady support for the arm to the level of  the article on which the work is to be done. The size of this table may  be made to suit the surroundings and the space of the builder. Figure 1  shows the table with a slot cut in the side support in which to place  the thumb screw of the bracket as shown on top of the table. It will be  noticed, Fig. 2, that while both drawer and cabinet are available for  storing the apparatus, they are not in the way of the operator while  sitting at his work; the drawer overhangs the knees and the cabinet is  far enough back not to interfere with sitting up close to the work. The  bracket shelf slides in the slot at the side of the table, and is  fastened to any height by the thumb screw There is also a smaller slide  bracket on the shelf to clamp irregular objects to the side of the  table. The thumb screws, hinges and drawer pulls can be purchased from  any hardware store. When the table is not in use for pyrography it can  be used for a writing table or a round top provided and attached on  which to play games. When used for this purpose the bracket, as well as  the pyrographic outfit, is stowed away in the cabinet as shown in Fig.  3.    [Illustration: Storage for Apparatus]          MISSION STAINS      What is mission oak stain? There are many on the market, with hardly two  alike in tone. The true mission oak stain may be said to show a dull  gray, the flakes showing a reddish tint, while the grain of the wood  will be almost a dead black. To produce such a stain take 1 lb. of drop  black in oil and 1/2 oz, of rose pink in oil, adding a gill of best  japan drier, thinning with three half-pints of turpentine. This will  make about 1 qt. of stain. Use these proportions for a larger quantity  of stain. Strain it through cheese cloth. Japan colors will give a  quicker drying stain than that made with oil colors, and in this case  omit the japan and add a little varnish to bind it.    One of the most popular of all the fancy oaks has been that known as  Flemish, and this in spite of its very somber color, says Wood Craft.  There are several ways of producing Flemish finish; you can fill the  wood with a paste filler strained with raw umber, and when dry apply a  stain of transparent flat raw umber, and for the darker shades of finish  use drop black with the umber. Varnish and rub down.    According to a foreign technical journal, French workmen mahoganize  various kinds of woods by the following method: The surface of the wood  to be stained is made perfectly smooth. Then it is given a coating of  dilute nitric acid which is rubbed well into the wood fiber. Then it is  stained with a mixture made by dissolving 1-1/2 oz. of dragon's blood in  a pint of alcohol, this solution being filtered, and then there is added  to it one-third of its weight of sodium carbonate. Apply this mixture  with a brush, and repeat the coats at intervals until the surface has  the appearance of polished mahogany. In case the luster should fail it  may be restored by rubbing with a little raw linseed oil. The  description of the process is meager, and hence he who would try it will  have to experiment a little.    A good cheap mission effect for oak is to mix together equal parts of  boiled linseed oil and good asphaltum varnish, and apply this to the  wood with a brush; in a minute or so you may rub off surplus with a rag,  and when dry give a coat of varnish. A gallon of this stain will cover  about 600 sq. ft.          FILLING OAK      A very good hardwood filler for oak, either for a natural or golden  effect, may be made from two parts of turpentine and one part of raw  linseed oil, with a small amount of good japan to dry in the usual time.  To this liquid add bolted gilder's whiting to form a suitable paste, it  may be made thin enough for use, if to be used at once, or into a stiff  paste for future use, when it can be thinned down for use, says  Woodworkers' Review. After applying a coat of filler, let stand until it  turns gray, which requires about 20 minutes, depending upon the amount  of japan in the filler, when it should be rubbed off with cotton waste  or whatever you use for the purpose. A filler must be rubbed well into  the wood, the surplus only being removed. The application of a coat of  burnt umber stain to the wood before filling is in order, which will  darken the wood to the proper depth if you rub off the surplus, showing  the grain and giving a golden oak effect. The filling should stand at  least a day and night before applying shellac and varnish.          WAX FINISHING      In wax-finishing hardwoods, use a paste filler and shellac varnish to  get a good surface. Of course, the wax may also be rubbed into the  unfilled wood but that gives you quite a different effect from the  regular wax polish, says a correspondent of Wood Craft. With soft woods  you first apply a stain, then apply a liquid filler or shellac,  according to the quality of work to be done. The former for the cheaper  job. The usual proportion of wax and turpentine is two parts of the  former to one part of the latter, melting the wax first, then adding the  spirits of turpentine. For reviving or polishing furniture you can add  three or four times as much turpentine as wax, all these proportions to  be by weight. To produce the desired egg-shell gloss, rub vigorously  with a brush of stiff bristles or woolen rag.          THE FUMING OF OAK      Darkened oak always has a better appearance when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23800"],[0,"Contemporary American Composers (#7)"],[1,"symphonic dignity, while in play of fancy,  suggestive programmaticism, and rollicking enthusiasm it is infectious  with wit. Gulliver himself is richly characterized with a burly,  blustering English theme. The storm that throws him on the shores of  Lilliput is handled with complete mastery, certain phrases picturing  the toss of the billows, another the great roll of the boat, others  the rattle of the rigging and the panic of the crew; and all wrought  up to a demoniac climax at the wreck. As the stranded Gulliver falls  asleep, the music hints his nodding off graphically. The entrance of  the Lilliputians is perhaps the happiest bit of the whole delicious  work. By adroit devices in instrumentation, their tiny band toots a  minute national hymn of irresistible drollery. The sound of their wee  hammers and the rest of the ludicrous adventures are carried off in  unfailing good humor. The scene finally changes to the rescuing ship.  Here a most hilarious hornpipe is interrupted by the distant call of  Gulliver's aria, and the rescue is consummated delightfully.    In nothing has Kelley showed such wanton scholarship and such  free-reined fancy as in his Chinese suite for orchestra, \"Aladdin.\" It  is certainly one of the most brilliant musical feats of the  generation, and rivals Richard Strauss in orchestral virtuosity.    While in San Francisco, where, as every one knows, there is a  transplanted corner of China, Kelley sat at the feet of certain  Celestial cacophonists, and made himself adept. He fathomed the, to  us, obscure laws of their theory, and for this work made a careful  selection of Chinese musical ideas, and used what little harmony they  approve of with most quaint and suggestive effect upon a splendid  background of his own. The result has not been, as is usual in such  alien mimicries, a mere success of curiosity.    The work had its first accolade of genius in the wild protests of the  music copyists, and in the downright mutiny of orchestral performers.    On the first page of the score is this note: \"This should be played  with a bow unscrewed, so that the hairs hang loose--thus the bow never  leaves the string.\" This direction is evidently meant to secure the  effect of the Chinese violin, in which the string passes between the  hair and the wood of the bow, and is played upon the under side. But  what self-respecting violinist could endure such profanation without  striking a blow for his fanes?    The first movement of the suite is made up of themes actually learned  from Chinese musicians. It represents the \"Wedding of Aladdin and the  Princess,\" a sort of sublimated \"shivaree\" in which oboes quawk, muted  trumpets bray, pizzicato strings flutter, and mandolins (loved of  Berlioz) twitter hilariously.    The second movement, \"A Serenade in the Royal Pear Garden,\" begins  with a luxurious tone-poem of moonlight and shadow, out of which,  after a preliminary tuning of the Chinese lute (or sam-yin), wails a  lyric caterwaul (alternately in 2-4 and 3-4 tempo) which the Chinese  translate as a love-song. Its amorous grotesque at length subsides  into the majestic night. A part of this altogether fascinating  movement came to Kelley in a dream.    The third chapter is devoted to the \"Flight of the Genie with the  Palace,\" and there is a wonderfully vivid suggestion of his struggle  to wrest loose the foundations of the building. At length he heaves it  slowly in the air, and wings majestically away with it.    It has always seemed to me that the purest stroke of genius in  instrumentation ever evinced was Wagner's conceit of using tinkling  bells to suggest leaping flames. And yet quite comparable with this  seems Kelley's device to indicate the oarage of the genie's mighty  wings as he disappears into the sky: liquid _glissandos_ on the upper  harp-strings, with chromatic runs upon the elaborately divided  violins, at length changed to sustained and most ethereally fluty  harmonics. It is very ravishment.    The last movement, \"The Return and Feast of the Lanterns,\" is on the  sonata formula. After an introduction typifying the opening of the  temple gates (a gong giving the music further locale), the first theme  is announced by harp and mandolin. It is an ancient Chinese air for  the yong-kim (a dulcimer-like instrument). The second subject is  adapted from the serenade theme. With these two smuggled themes  everything contrapuntal (a fugue included) and instrumental is done  that technical bravado could suggest or true art license. The result  is a carnival of technic that compels the layman to wonder and the  scholar to homage.    A transcription for a piano duet has been made of this last movement.    In Chinese-tone also is Kelley's most popular song, \"The Lady Picking  Mulberries,\" which brought him not only the enthusiasm of Americans  but the high commendation of the Chinese themselves. It is written in  the limited Chinese scale, with harmonies of our school; and is a  humoresque of such catchiness that it has pervaded even London and  Paris.    This song is one of a series of six lyrics called \"The Phases of  Love,\" with this motive from the \"Anatomy of Melancholy\": \"I am  resolved, therefore, in this tragi-comedy of love, to act several  parts, some satirically, some comically, some in a mixed tone.\" The  poems are all by American poets, and the group, opus 6, is an  invaluable addition to our musical literature. The first of the  series, \"My Silent Song,\" is a radiantly beautiful work, with a  wondrous tender air to a rapturous accompaniment. The second is a  setting of Edward Rowland Sill's perfect little poem, \"Love's Fillet.\"  The song is as full of art as it is of feeling and influence. \"What  the Man in the Moon Saw\" is an engaging satire, \"Love and Sleep\" is  sombre, and \"In a Garden\" is pathetic.    Besides two small sketches, a waltz and a gavotte, and his own  arrangements, for two and for four hands, of the Gaelic March in  \"Macbeth,\" Kelley has published only three piano pieces: opus 2, \"The  Flower Seekers,\" superb with grace, warm harmony, and May ecstasies;  \"Confluentia,\" whose threads of liquidity are eruditely, yet  romantically, intertangled to represent the confluence of the Rhine  and the Moselle; and \"The Headless Horseman,\" a masterpiece of  burlesque weirdness, representing the wild pursuit of Ichabod Crane  and the final hurling of the awful head,--a pumpkin, some say. It is  relieved by Ichabod's tender reminiscences of Katrina Van Tassel at  the spinning-wheel, and is dedicated to Joseffy, the pianist, who  lives in the region about Sleepy Hollow.    To supplement his successful, humorously melodramatic setting of \"The  Little Old Woman who Went to the Market her Eggs for to Sell,\" Kelley  is preparing a series of similar pieces called \"Tales Retold for  Musical Children.\" It will include \"Gulliver,\" \"Aladdin,\" and \"Beauty  and the Beast.\"    Kelley once wrote music for an adaptation of \"Prometheus Bound,\" made  by the late George Parsons Lathrop for that ill-starred experiment,  the Theatre of Arts and Letters. The same thoroughness of research  that gave Kelley such a command of Chinese theories equipped him in  what knowledge we have of Greek and the other ancient music. He has  delivered a course of lectures on these subjects, and this learning  was put to good and public use in his share in the staging of the  novel \"Ben Hur.\" His music had a vital part in carrying the play over  the thin ice of sacrilege; it was so reverent and so appealing that  the scrubwomen in the theatre were actually moved to tears during its  rehearsal, and it gave the scene of the miraculous cure of the lepers  a dignity that saved it from either ridicule or reproach.    In the first act there is a suggestion of the slow, soft march of a  caravan across the sand, the eleven-toned Greek and Egyptian scale  being used. In the tent of the Sheik, an old Arabian scale is  employed. In the elaborate ballets and revels in the \"Grove of Daphne\"  the use of Greek scales, Greek progressions (such as descending  parallel fourths long forbidden by the doctors of our era), a  trimetrical grouping of measures (instead of our customary fourfold  basis), and a suggestion of Hellenic instruments,--all this lore has  not robbed the scene in any sense of an irresistible brilliance and  spontaneity. The weaving of Arachne's web is pictured with especial  power. Greek traditions have, of course, been used only for  occasional impressionisms, and not as manacles. Elaborately colored  modern instrumentation and all the established devices from canon up  are employed. A piano transcription of part of the music is promised.  The \"Song of Iras\" has been published. It is full of home-sickness,  and the accompaniment (not used in the production) is a wonderwork of  color.    [Music:        Tottering above      In her highest noon      The enamoured moon blushes with love      While to listen      The red levin      With the rapid pleiads even      Which were seven      Pauses in heaven!

KELLEY.]    Kelley has two unpublished songs that show him at his best, both  settings of verse by Poe,--\"Eldorado,\" which vividly develops the  persistence of the knight, and \"Israfel.\" This latter poem, as you  know, concerns the angel \"whose heart-strings are a lute.\" After a  rhapsody upon the cosmic spell of the angel's singing, Poe, with a  brave defiance, flings an implied challenge to him. The verse marks  one of the highest reaches of a genius honored abroad as a world-great  lyrist. It is, perhaps, praise enough, then, to say that Kelley's  music flags in no wise behind the divine"]]]
