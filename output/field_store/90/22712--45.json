There, then, awhile in chains we lay,      In wintry dungeons, far from day;      But ris'n at length, with might and main,      Our iron fetters burst in twain.        Then all the horns were blown in town;      And to the ramparts clanging down,      All the giants leaped to horse      And charged behind us through the gorse.        On we rode, the others and I,      Over the mountains blue, and by      The Silver River, the sounding sea,      And the robber woods of Tartary.        A thousand miles we galloped fast,      And down the witches' lane we passed,      And rode amain, with brandished sword,      Up to the middle, through the ford.        Last we drew rein--a weary three--      Upon the lawn, in time for tea,      And from our steeds alighted down      Before the gates of Babylon."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2562"],[0,"The Clouds (#7)"],[1,"first?         Unj. I will give him the precedence; and then, from       these things which he adduces, I will shoot him dead       with new words and thoughts. And at last, if he mutter,       he shall be destroyed, being stung in his whole face and       his two eyes by my maxims, as if by bees.         Cho. Now the two, relying on very dexterous arguments       and thoughts, and sententious maxims, will show which of       them shall appear superior in argument. For now the       whole crisis of wisdom is here laid before them; about       which my friends have a very great contest. But do you,       who adorned our elders with many virtuous manners, utter       the voice in which you rejoice, and declare your nature.         Just. I will, therefore, describe the ancient system of       education, how it was ordered, when I flourished in the       advocacy of justice, and temperance was the fashion. In       the first place it was incumbent that no one should hear       the voice of a boy uttering a syllable; and next, that       those from the same quarter of the town should march in       good order through the streets to the school of the       harp-master, naked, and in a body, even if it were to       snow as thick as meal. Then again, their master would       teach them, not sitting cross-legged, to learn by rote a       song, either \"pallada persepolin deinan\"  or \"teleporon       ti boama\"  raising to a higher pitch the harmony which       our fathers transmitted to us. But if any of them were       to play the buffoon, or to turn any quavers, like these       difficult turns the present artists make after the       manner of Phrynis, he used to be thrashed, being beaten       with many blows, as banishing the Muses. And it behooved       the boys, while sitting in the school of the       Gymnastic-master, to cover the thigh, so that they might       exhibit nothing indecent to those outside; then again,       after rising from the ground, to sweep the sand       together, and to take care not to leave an impression of       the person for their lovers. And no boy used in those       days to anoint himself below the navel; so that their       bodies wore the appearance of blooming health. Nor used       he to go to his lover, having made up his voice in an       effeminate tone, prostituting himself with his eyes. Nor       used it to be allowed when one was dining to take the       head of the radish, or to snatch from their seniors dill       or parsley, or to eat fish, or to giggle, or to keep the       legs crossed.         Unj. Aye, antiquated and dipolia-like  and full of       grasshoppers, and of Cecydes, and of the Buphonian       festival!         Just Yet certainly these are those principles by which       my system of education nurtured the men who fought at       Marathon. But you teach the men of the present day, so       that I am choked, when at the Panathenaia a fellow,       holding his shield before his person, neglects       Tritogenia,  when they ought to dance. Wherefore, O       youth, choose with confidence, me, the better cause, and       you will learn to hate the Agora, and to refrain from       baths, and to be ashamed of what is disgraceful, and to       be enraged if any one jeer you, and to rise up from       seats before your seniors when they approach, and not to       behave ill toward your parents, and to do nothing else       that is base, because you are to form in your mind an       image of Modesty: and not to dart into the house of a       dancing-woman, lest, while gaping after these things,       being struck with an apple by a wanton, you should be       damaged in your reputation: and not to contradict your       father in anything; nor by calling him Iapetus, to       reproach him with the ills of age, by which you were       reared in your infancy.         Unj. If you shall believe him in this, O youth, by       Bacchus, you will be like the sons of Hippocrates, and       they will call you a booby.         Just. Yet certainly shall you spend your time in the       gymnastic schools, sleek and blooming; not chattering in       the market-place rude jests, like the youths of the       present day; nor dragged into court for a petty suit,       greedy, pettifogging, knavish; but you shall descend to       the Academy  and run races beneath the sacred olives       along with some modest compeer, crowned with white       reeds, redolent of yew, and careless ease, of       leaf-shedding white poplar, rejoicing in the season of       spring, when the plane-tree whispers to the elm. If you       do these things which I say, and apply your mind to       these, you will ever have a stout chest, a clear       complexion, broad shoulders, a little tongue, large       hips, little lewdness. But if you practise what the       youths of the present day do, you will have in the first       place, a pallid complexion, small shoulders, a narrow       chest, a large tongue, little hips, great lewdness, a       long psephism;  and this deceiver will persuade you to       consider everything that is base to be honourable, and       what is honourable to be base; and in addition to this,       he will fill you with the lewdness of Antimachus.         Cho. O thou that practisest most renowned high-towering       wisdom! How sweetly does a modest grace attend your       words! Happy, therefore, were they who lived in those       days, in the times of former men! In reply, then, to       these, O thou that hast a dainty-seeming Muse, it       behooveth thee to say something new; since the man has       gained renown. And it appears you have need of powerful       arguments against him, if you are to conquer the man and       not incur laughter.         Unj. And yet I was choking in my heart, and was longing       to confound all these with contrary maxims. For I have       been called among the deep thinkers the \"worse cause\" on       this very account, that I first contrived how to speak       against both law and justice; and this art is worth more       than ten thousand staters, that one should choose the       worse cause, and nevertheless be victorious. But mark       how I will confute the system of education on which he       relies, who says, in the first place, that he will not       permit you to be washed with warm water. And yet, on       what principle do you blame the warm baths?         Just. Because it is most vile, and makes a man cowardly.         Unj. Stop! For immediately I seize and hold you by the       waist without escape. Come, tell me, which of the sons       of Jupiter do you deem to have been the bravest in soul,       and to have undergone most labours?         Just. I consider no man superior to Hercules.         Unj. Where, pray, did you ever see cold Herculean baths?       And yet, who was more valiant than he?         Just. These are the very things which make the bath full       of youths always chattering all day long, but the       palaestras empty.         Unj. You next find fault with their living in the       market-place; but I commend it. For if it had been bad,       Homer would never have been for representing Nestor  as       an orator; nor all the other wise men. I will return,       then, from thence to the tongue, which this fellow says       our youths ought not to exercise, while I maintain they       should. And again, he says they ought to be modest: two       very great evils. For tell me to whom you have ever seen       any good accrue through modesty and confute me by your       words.         Just. To many. Peleus,  at any rate, received his sword       on account of it.         Unj. A sword? Marry, he got a pretty piece of luck, the       poor wretch! While Hyperbolus, he of the lamps, got more       than many talents by his villainy, but by Jupiter, no       sword!         Just. And Peleus married Thetis, too, through his       modesty.         Unj. And then she went off and left him; for he was not       lustful, nor an agreeable bedfellow to spend the night       with. Now a woman delights in being wantonly treated.       But you are an old dotard. For (to Phidippides)       consider, O youth, all that attaches to modesty, and of       how many pleasures you are about to be deprived--of       women, of games at cottabus, of dainties, of       drinking-bouts, of giggling. And yet, what is life worth       to you if you be deprived of these enjoyments? Well, I       will pass from thence to the necessities of our nature.       You have gone astray, you have fallen in love, you have       been guilty of some adultery, and then have been caught.       You are undone, for you are unable to speak. But if you       associate with me, indulge your inclination, dance,       laugh, and think nothing disgraceful. For if you should       happen to be detected as an adulterer, you will make       this reply to him, \"that you have done him no injury\":       and then refer him to Jupiter, how even he is overcome       by love and women. And yet, how could you, who are a       mortal, have greater power than a god?         Just. But what if he should suffer the radish through       obeying you, and be depillated with hot ashes?  What       argument will he be able to state, to prove that he is       not a blackguard?         Unj. And if he be a blackguard, what harm will he       suffer?         Just. Nay, what could he ever suffer still greater than       this?         Unj. What then will you say if you be conquered by me in       this?         Just. I will be silent: what else can I do?         Unj. Come, now, tell me; from what class do the       advocates come?         Just. From the blackguards.         Unj. I believe you. What then? From what class do       tragedians come?         Just. From the blackguards.         Unj. You say well. But from what class do the public       orators come?         Just. From the blackguards. "]]]
