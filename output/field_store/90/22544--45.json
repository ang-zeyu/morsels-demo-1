I'll let you know when she comes along, Prissie!\"    \"All serene! Bring her to school if you like!\" laughed Prissie. \"You  didn't let me finish, or I might have gone on to something nicer. There  were other things on the cards as well as those.\"    \"What things?\"    \"Oh, I shan't tell you now, when you only make fun of them! Sh! sh!  Here's Miss Herbert!\"    And Prissie, turning away from her comrade, opened her French dictionary  and plunged into the difficulties of her page of translation from  Racine.          CHAPTER IV    Disinherited      Valentine's Day had brought early flowers, and the song of the thrush  and glints of golden sunshine, but the bright weather was too good to  last, and winter again stretched out an icy hand to check the advance of  spring. Green daffodil buds peeped through a covering of snow, and the  yellow jessamine blossom fell sodden in the rain. The playing-field was  a quagmire, and the girls had to depend upon walking for their daily  exercise. Their tramps were somewhat of an adventure, for in places the  swollen brooks were washing over the tops of their bridges, and they  would be obliged to turn back, or go round by devious ways. The river in  the valley had overflowed its banks and spread over the low-lying  meadows like a lake. Tops of gates and hedges appeared above the flood,  and sea-gulls, driven inland by the gales, swam over the pastures.  Flocks of peewits, starlings, and red-wings collected on the uplands,  and an occasional heron might be seen flitting majestically across the  storm-flecked sky.    As a rule the school sallied forth in waterproofs and thick boots,  regardless of drizzle or slight snow, but on days of blizzard there was  Swedish drill or dancing in the big class-room, to work off the  superfluous energy accumulated during hours of sitting still at lessons.    One afternoon, when driving sleet and showers swept past the house, and  an inclement sky hid every hint of sunshine, the twenty girls, clad in  their gymnasium costumes, were hard at work doing Indian club exercises.  Dulcie, who stood in the vicinity of the window, could watch the  raindrops splashing on the pane, and see the wet tree-tops waving about  in the wind, and runnels of water coursing down the drive like little  rivulets. It was the sort of afternoon when nobody who could help it  would choose to be out, and a visitor to the Hall seemed about the most  unlikely event on the face of the earth. Judge her surprise, therefore,  when she heard the hoot of a motor-horn, and the next instant saw,  coming up the drive, the well-known Daimler touring car from Cheverley  Chase. In her excitement she almost dropped her clubs. Had Cousin Clare  come over to see them? Or had Everard a holiday? She longed to  communicate the thrilling news to Lilias, but the music was still going  on, and her arms must move in time to it. She waited in a flutter of  expectation, revolving all kinds of delightful possibilities that might  occur. Cousin Clare would surely send a cake and a box of chocolates,  even if she had not come herself. Five minutes passed, then Davis, the  parlor-maid, opened the door, and whispered a brief message to Miss  Perkins. The mistress held up her hand and stopped the exercises.    \"Lilias and Dulcie are wanted at once in the study,\" she said.    Amid the astonished looks of their companions, the two girls put down  their clubs and left the room, Dulcie hastily telling her sister, as  they hurried down the passage, how she had seen the car from the window.  They tapped at the study door, and entered full of pleasant  anticipation. Miss Walters was standing by the fire, with a letter in  her hand.    \"Come in, girls,\" she said gravely. \"I've sent for you because I have  something very sad to tell you. Can you prepare your minds for a great  shock? Your Grandfather was taken ill suddenly last night, and passed  away this morning. Your cousin has sent the car to fetch you both home.  Go at once and change your dresses, and Miss Harvey will help you to  pack a few clothes. The chauffeur is having some tea, but you must not  keep him waiting very long. I can't tell you how grieved I am. You must  be brave girls and try to comfort every one else at home. It will be a  sad loss for you all.\"    Lilias and Dulcie went upstairs almost dazed with the unexpected bad  news. They could hardly believe that their grandfather, whom they had  left apparently in the best of health and spirits, could have gone away  into that other world where Father and Mother and a little sister had  already passed over before. They packed in a sort of dream, drank the  cups of tea which Miss Walters, full of kind sympathy, pressed upon them  in the hall, greeted Milner, who was starting his engine, and entered  the waiting car. Owing to the floods, they took a roundabout route, but  half an hour's drive through sleet and rain brought them to Cheverley  Chase. It was strange to see the blinds all down as they drew up at the  house. As they ran indoors, Winder, the old butler, came from his pantry  into the hall. They questioned him eagerly. He shook his head as he  replied:    \"It's a sad business, Miss Lilias and Miss Dulcie. He was just as usual  yesterday, then about nine o'clock Miss Clare rang the bell violently,  and when I came into the drawing-room, there was Master lying on the  floor in a kind of fit. I telephoned to the doctor, and we got him to  bed, but he never recovered consciousness. He went at eleven this  morning, as you'll see by the clock there. I stopped all the clocks at  once. It's the right thing to do in a house when the master dies. Miss  Clare's in her room. I'll let her know you've arrived.\"    \"We'll go and find her, thank you,\" said Lilias, walking quietly  upstairs.    The Ingleton children were truly grieved at the loss of the grandfather  who, for so many years, had stood to them in the place of a parent. They  went softly about the house and spoke in hushed voices. Everything  seemed strange and unusual. A dressmaker came from London with boxes of  mourning for Cousin Clare and the girls; beautiful wreaths and crosses  of flowers kept arriving and were carried upstairs. Mr. Bowden, the  lawyer, was constantly in and out, making arrangements for the funeral;  neighbors left cards with \"Kind sympathy\" written across the corner.  Everard, who had arrived home shortly after his sisters, seemed to have  grown years older. He walked with a new dignity, as of one who is  suddenly called to fill a high position.    \"I'll be a good brother to you all,\" he said to the younger ones. \"You  must always look upon the Chase as your home, of course. I'll do  everything for you that Grandfather ever did, and more!\"    \"Will the Chase be yours now, then, Everard?\" asked Bevis.    \"I suppose so. I'm the eldest son, you see, and the property has always  gone in the direct line. It was entailed until fifty years ago. I shan't  make any changes. I've told the servants so, and they all said they  wished to stay on. I wouldn't part with Winder or Milner for the world!  They're part of the establishment.\"    \"I couldn't imagine the place without them,\" agreed Dulcie.    On the afternoon before the funeral, Mr. Bowden, who had motored over to  make some final arrangements, concluded his business, drank a cup of tea  in the drawing-room, and was escorted by Everard and Lilias through the  hall.    \"The passing of the Squire is a sad loss to the neighborhood,\" he  remarked. \"He was a true type of the good old school of country  gentlemen, and most of us feel 'we shall not look upon his like again.'\"    \"No,\" replied Everard. \"It will be very hard to succeed him, I know, but  I shall try to do my best.\"    Mr. Bowden started, looked at him musingly for a moment, knitted his  brows, then apparently came to a decision. Instead of taking his hat and  coat from Winder, he waved the two young people into the study, followed  them, and shut the door.    \"I want a word with you in private,\" he began. \"I'm going to do a very  unprofessional thing, but, as I've known you for years, I feel the case  justifies me. I can't let you come into the dining-room to-morrow, after  the funeral, and hear your grandfather's will read aloud, without giving  you some warning beforehand of its contents. I hinted to you, Everard,  at Christmas-time, not to count too much upon expectations.\"    \"Why, but surely I am the heir?\" burst out Everard with white lips.    \"My poor boy, you are nothing of the sort. Your grandfather has willed  the property to the child of his elder son, Tristram.\"    At that critical moment there was a rap at the door, and Winder, the  butler, entered, respectfully apologetic, to summon Mr. Bowden to the  telephone. The lawyer answered the call, which was apparently a very  urgent one, for, without another word to Everard and Lilias, he took hat  and coat, hurried from the house, mounted his motor-cycle, and was gone.  He left utter consternation behind him. The two young people, returning  to the study, tried to face the disastrous news. He had indeed told them  no details, but the main outline was quite sufficient. They could  scarcely accustom themselves to believe it for a moment or two.    \"To bring me up as the heir, and then disinherit me!\" gasped Everard.    \"Why, everybody called you 'the young squire'!\" exclaimed Lilias. \"It's  unthinkable!\"    \"Unthinkable or not, I'm afraid it's true,\" said Everard bitterly.  \"Bowden wouldn't have told me otherwise. I suppose he drew up the will,  so he knows what's in it. Nice position to be in, isn't it? Turned out  to make room for some other chap!\"    \"Who is this child of Uncle Tristram's? We've never heard of him.\"    \"It'll be the kid who is in that photo, I suppose--Leslie. He looked  about a year old in the portrait, and it's thirteen years since Uncle  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#7)"],[1,"liberty,      When straight a barbarous noise environs me    Of owls and cuckoos, asses, apes, and dogs.    So he is brought, with great reluctance, to the estimate of men which is  expressed by Milton in _The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates_; \"being  slaves within doors, no wonder that they strive so much to have the  public state conformably governed to the inward vicious rule whereby they  govern themselves. For indeed none can love freedom heartily but good  men.\"    Milton cannot claim the exemption from censure which is allowed to the  theorists, the builders of ideal states somewhere in the clouds. On his  own behalf he expressly disclaims any such intention. \"To sequester out  of the world,\" he says, \"into Atlantic and Utopian politics, which never  can be drawn into use, will not mend our condition; but to ordain wisely  as in this world of evil, in the midst whereof God has placed us  unavoidably.\" Poetry might well have served him, if his object had been  to add another to imaginary commonwealths. He took up with politics  because he believed that in the disorder of the times his ideas might be  made a \"programme,\" and carried into effect.    It was in 1641, when already \"the vigour of the Parliament had begun to  humble the pride of the bishops,\" that he first intervened. \"I saw,\" he  says, \"that a way was opening for the establishment of real liberty; that  the foundation was laying for the deliverance of mankind from the yoke of  slavery and superstition.... I perceived that if I ever wished to be of  use, I ought at least not to be wanting to my country, to the church, and  to so many of my fellow-Christians, in a crisis of so much danger; I  therefore determined to relinquish the other pursuits in which I was  engaged, and to transfer the whole force of my talents and my industry to  this one important object.\" So he wrote the treatise in two books, _Of  Reformation in England, and the causes that hitherto have hindered it._  His later pamphlets are all similarly occasional in nature, written with  a particular and definite object in view. In these he advocates as  practicable and much-needed reforms, among other things, the  establishment of a perpetual republic on the lines of an oligarchy; the  abolition of bishops, religious ceremonials, liturgies, tithes, and,  indeed, of all regular payment or salary given to ministers of religion;  the supersession of universities and public schools by the erection of  new academic institutions, combining the functions of both, \"in every  City throughout this Land\"; the legalisation of free divorce; and the  repeal of the ordinances compelling all books to be licensed. If he did  not advocate, in any of the works put forth during his lifetime, the  legal toleration of polygamy, it was probably only because he perceived  that that, at least, did not fall within the scope of practical politics.  He defends it in his posthumous treatise, _De Doctrina Christiana_.    It will readily be seen that on almost all these questions Milton was not  only--to use the foolish modern phrase--\"in advance of his time,\" but  also considerably in advance of ours. Twenty years after his death the  Licensing Acts were abolished; for the rest, his reforms are yet to  accomplish. It is an odd remark of one of his learned biographers that  the _Areopagitica_ is the only one of all Milton's prose writings \"whose  topic is not obsolete.\" It is the only one of his prose writings whose  thesis commands the general assent of modern readers, and is, therefore,  from his own practical point of view, obsolete.    The mere enumeration of his opinions suffices to show that Milton's is a  sad case of the poet in politics. The labours of the twenty prime years  of his manhood have been copiously bewailed. To have Pegasus in harness  is bad enough; but when the waggon that he draws is immovably stuck in  the mud, and he himself bespattered by his efforts, the spectacle is yet  more pitiable. Many of his critics have expressed regret that he did not  make for himself an artificial seclusion, and continue his purely  poetical labours, with the classics for companions. The questions that  drew him into politics were burning questions, it is true; but were there  not others to deal with them, good, earnest, sensible, homely people?  Samuel Butler has enumerated some of those who were dedicating their time  and thought to politics at this important crisis:--      The oyster-women locked their fish up,    And trudged away to cry \"No Bishop\":    The mouse-trap men laid save-alls by,    And 'gainst ev'l counsellors did cry;    Botchers left old cloaths in the lurch,    And fell to turn and patch the Church;    Some cried the Covenant, instead    Of pudding-pies and ginger-bread,    And some for brooms, old boots and shoes,    Bawled out to purge the Common-house:    Instead of kitchen-stuff, some cry    A gospel-preaching ministry;    And some for old shirts, coats or cloak,    No surplices nor service-book;    A strange harmonious inclination    Of all degrees to reformation.    But what was Milton doing in this malodorous and noisy assembly? Might he  not with all confidence have left the Church to the oyster-women, and the  State to the mouse-trap men? The company that he kept with them ruined  his manners; he had to speak loud in order to be heard, to speak broad in  order to be respected; and so (bitterest thought of all!) he lost  something of that sweet reasonableness which is a poet's proper grace.    The answer to this strain of criticism is to be found in the study of  Milton's works, poetry and prose--and perhaps best in the poetry. We  could not have had anything at all like _Paradise Lost_ from a dainty,  shy poet-scholar; nor anything half so great. The greatest men hold their  power on this tenure, that they shall not husband it because the occasion  that presents itself, although worthy of high effort, is not answerable  to the refinement of their tastes. Milton, it is too often forgotten, was  an Englishman. He held the privilege and the trust not cheap. When God  intends some new and great epoch in human history, \"what does he then,\"  this poet exultantly asks, \"but reveal himself to his servants, and, as  his manner is, first to his Englishmen?\" To his chief work in poetry he  was instigated by patriotic motives. \"I applied myself,\" he says, \"to  that resolution which Ariosto followed against the persuasions of Bembo,  to fix all the industry and art I could unite to the adorning of my  native tongue, not to make verbal curiosity the end (that were a toilsome  vanity), but to be an interpreter and relater of the best and sagest  things among mine own citizens throughout this island in the mother  dialect.\"    There is plenty of \"verbal curiosity\" in Milton's poetry; he is in some  respects the finest craftsman who ever handled the English speech: so  that this declaration is the more timely to remind us by how wide a chasm  he is separated from those modern greenhouse poets who move contentedly  in an atmosphere of art ideals and art theories. He had his breeding from  the ancient world, where AEschylus fought at Marathon, and he could not  think of politics as of a separable part of human life.      To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,    Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair,    is a lyric ideal that may quite well consist with political indifference,  but how should an epic inspiration be nourished where the prosperity of  the State is lightly esteemed? Even had poetry lost by his political  adventures, he would have been content that politics should gain. And  politics did gain; for Milton's prose works raise every question they  touch, even where they cannot truly be said to advance it. It is as  unseemly for the politicians to complain of his choice, as it would be  for the herdsmen of King Admetus to complain of the presence among them  of a god. The large considerations and high passions imported into the  treatment of practical questions by a Milton, or a Burke, have done much  to keep even party politics at a high level in England, so that civil  servants and journalists may join in the hymn of the herdsmen--      He has been our fellow, the morning of our days,    Us he chose for house-mates, and this way went.            God, of whom music            And song and blood are pure,            The day is never darkened            That had thee here obscure!    In a long autobiographic passage in the _Second Defence of the People of  England_ Milton makes a formal classification of his prose works written  before that date. All of them, he says, were designed to promote Liberty.  By the accidents of the time he was induced to treat first, in his  anti-episcopal pamphlets, of religious liberty. Once that controversy was  fairly ablaze, in the name of the same goddess he applied his incendiary  torch to humbler piles. \"I perceived,\" he says, \"that there were three  species of liberty which are essential to the happiness of social  life--religious, domestic, and civil; and as I had already written  concerning the first, and the magistrates were strenuously active in  obtaining the third, I determined to turn my attention to the second, or  the domestic species.\" He includes in this division of his work the  Divorce pamphlets, the tractate _Of Education_, and the _Areopagitica_,  as dealing with the \"three material questions\" (so he calls them) of  domestic liberty, namely, \"the conditions of the conjugal tie, the  education of the children, and the free publication of the thoughts.\"    It seems a strange conception of domestic liberty which makes it rest on  a threefold support--divorce at will, an unrestrained printing-press, and  the encyclopaedic education of polyglot children. But the truth is that  Milton's classification is an after-thought. The pamphlets that he names  were all written by him much about the same time, between 1643 and 1645;  but the true history of "]]]
