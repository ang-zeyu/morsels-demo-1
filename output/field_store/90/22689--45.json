What then? First thing you know you'll be dreaming again--thank the  Lord for it. I ain't going to ask you what's soured you on dreaming  just now. After awhile you'll begin again, especially if you come to  this garden as much as I hope you will. It's chockful of dreams--_any_  kind of dreams. You take your choice. Now, _I_ favour dreams of  adventures, if you'll believe it. I'm sixty-one and I never do anything  rasher than go out cod-fishing on a fine day, but I still lust after  adventures. Then I dream I'm an awful fellow--blood-thirsty.\"    I burst out laughing. Perhaps laughter was somewhat rare in that old  garden. Tamzine, who was weeding at the far end, lifted her head in a  startled fashion and walked past us into the house. She did not look  at us or speak to us. She was reputed to be abnormally shy. She was  very stout and wore a dress of bright red-and-white striped material.  Her face was round and blank, but her reddish hair was abundant and  beautiful. A huge, orange-coloured cat was at her heels; as she passed  us he bounded over to the arbour and sprang up on Abel's knee. He was  a gorgeous brute, with vivid green eyes, and immense white double  paws.    \"Captain Kidd, Mr. Woodley.\" He introduced us as seriously as if the  cat had been a human being. Neither Captain Kidd nor I responded very  enthusiastically.    \"You don't like cats, I reckon, master,\" said Abel, stroking the  Captain's velvet back. \"I don't blame you. I was never fond of them  myself until I found the Captain. I saved his life and when you've  saved a creature's life you're bound to love it. It's next thing to  giving it life. There are some terrible thoughtless people in the  world, master. Some of those city folks who have summer homes down the  harbour are so thoughtless that they're cruel. It's the worst kind of  cruelty, I think--the thoughtless kind. You can't cope with it. They  keep cats there in the summer and feed them and pet them and doll them  up with ribbons and collars; and then in the fall they go off and  leave them to starve or freeze. It makes my blood boil, master.\"    \"One day last winter I found a poor old mother cat dead on the shore,  lying against the skin and bone bodies of her three little kittens.  She had died trying to shelter them. She had her poor stiff claws  around them. Master, I cried. Then I swore. Then I carried those poor  little kittens home and fed 'hem up and found good homes for them. I  know the woman who left the cat. When she comes back this summer I'm  going to go down and tell her my opinion of her. It'll be rank  meddling, but, lord, how I love meddling in a good cause.\"    \"Was Captain Kidd one of the forsaken?\" I asked.    \"Yes. I found him one bitter cold day in winter caught in the  branches of a tree by his darn-fool ribbon collar. He was almost  starving. Lord, if you could have seen his eyes! He was nothing but a  kitten, and he'd got his living somehow since he'd been left till he  got hung up. When I loosed him he gave my hand a pitiful swipe with  his little red tongue. He wasn't the prosperous free-booter you behold  now. He was meek as Moses. That was nine years ago. His life has been  long in the land for a cat. He's a good old pal, the Captain is.\"    \"I should have expected you to have a dog,\" I said.    Abel shook his head.    \"I had a dog once. I cared so much for him that when he died I  couldn't bear the thought of ever getting another in his place. He was  a _friend_--you understand? The Captain's only a pal. I'm fond of the  Captain--all the fonder because of the spice of deviltry there is in  all cats. But I _loved_ my dog. There isn't any devil in a good dog.  That's why they're more lovable than cats--but I'm darned if they're  as interesting.\"    I laughed as I rose regretfully.    \"Must you go, master? And we haven't talked any business after all. I  reckon it's that stove matter you've come about. It's like those two  fool trustees to start up a stove sputter in spring. It's a wonder  they didn't leave it till dog-days and begin then.\"    \"They merely wished me to ask you if you approved of putting in a new  stove.\"    \"Tell them to put in a new stove--any kind of a new stove--and be  hanged to them,\" rejoined Abel. \"As for you, master, you're welcome to  this garden any time. If you're tired or lonely, or too ambitious or  angry, come here and sit awhile, master. Do you think any man could  keep mad if he sat and looked into the heart of a pansy for ten  minutes? When you feel like talking, I'll talk, and when you feel like  thinking, I'll let you. I'm a great hand to leave folks alone.\"    \"I think I'll come often,\" I said, \"perhaps too often.\"    \"Not likely, master--not likely--not after we've watched a moonrise  contentedly together. It's as good a test of compatibility as any I  know. You're young and I'm old, but our souls are about the same age,  I reckon, and we'll find lots to say to each other. Are you going  straight home from here?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then I'm going to bother you to stop for a moment at Mary Bascom's  and give her a bouquet of my white lilacs. She loves 'em and I'm not  going to wait till she's dead to send her flowers.\"    \"She's very ill just now, isn't she?\"    \"She's got the Bascom consumption. That means she may die in a month,  like her brother, or linger on for twenty years, like her father. But  long or short, white lilac in spring is sweet, and I'm sending her a  fresh bunch every day while it lasts. It's a rare night, master. I  envy you your walk home in the moonlight along that shore.\"    \"Better come part of the way with me,\" I suggested.    \"No.\" Abel glanced at the house. \"Tamzine never likes to be alone o'  nights. So I take my moonlight walks in the garden. The moon's a great  friend of mine, master. I've loved her ever since I can remember. When  I was a little lad of eight I fell asleep in the garden one evening  and wasn't missed. I woke up alone in the night and I was most scared  to death, master. Lord, what shadows and queer noises there were! I  darsn't move. I just sat there quaking, poor small mite. Then all at  once I saw the moon looking down at me through the pine boughs, just  like an old friend. I was comforted right off. Got up and walked to  the house as brave as a lion, looking at her. Goodnight, master. Tell  Mary the lilacs'll last another week yet.\"    From that night Abel and I were cronies. We walked and talked and kept  silence and fished cod together. Stillwater people thought it very  strange that I should prefer his society to that of the young fellows  of my own age. Mrs. Campbell was quite worried over it, and opined  that there had always been something queer about me. \"Birds of a  feather.\"    I loved that old garden by the harbour shore. Even Abel himself, I  think, could hardly have felt a deeper affection for it. When its gate  closed behind me it shut out the world and my corroding memories and  discontents. In its peace my soul emptied itself of the bitterness  which had been filling and spoiling it, and grew normal and healthy  again, aided thereto by Abel's wise words. He never preached, but he  radiated courage and endurance and a frank acceptance of the hard  things of life, as well as a cordial welcome of its pleasant things.  He was the sanest soul I ever met. He neither minimized ill nor  exaggerated good, but he held that we should never be controlled by  either. Pain should not depress us unduly, nor pleasure lure us into  forgetfulness and sloth. All unknowingly he made me realize that I had  been a bit of a coward and a shirker. I began to understand that my  personal woes were not the most important things in the universe, even  to myself. In short, Abel taught me to laugh again; and when a man can  laugh wholesomely things are not going too badly with him.    That old garden was always such a cheery place. Even when the east  wind sang in minor and the waves on the gray shore were sad, hints of  sunshine seemed to be lurking all about it. Perhaps this was because  there were so many yellow flowers in it. Tamzine liked yellow flowers.  Captain Kidd, too, always paraded it in panoply of gold. He was so  large and effulgent that one hardly missed the sun. Considering his  presence I wondered that the garden was always so full of singing  birds. But the Captain never meddled with them. Probably he understood  that his master would not have tolerated it for a moment. So there was  always a song or a chirp somewhere. Overhead flew the gulls and the  cranes. The wind in the pines always made a glad salutation. Abel and  I paced the walks, in high converse on matters beyond the ken of cat  or king.    \"I liked to ponder on all problems, though I can never solve them,\"  Abel used to say. \"My father held that we should never talk of things  we couldn't understand. But, lord, master, if we didn't the subjects  for conversation would be mighty few. I reckon the gods laugh many a  time to hear us, but what matter? So long as we remember that we're  only men, and don't take to fancying ourselves gods, really knowing  good and evil, I reckon our discussions won't do us or anyone much  harm. So we'll have another whack at the origin of evil this evening,  master.\"    Tamzine forgot to be shy with me at last, and gave me a broad smile of  welcome every time I came. But she rarely spoke to me. She spent all  her spare time weeding the garden, which she loved as well as Abel  did. She was addicted to bright colours and always wore wrappers of  very gorgeous print. She worshipped Abel and his word was a law unto  her.    \"I am very thankful Tamzine is so well,\" said Abel one evening as we  watched the sunset. The day had begun sombrely in gray cloud and mist,  but it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24884"],[0,"Commercial Geography (#7)"],[1,"look to the United States for wheat and cotton, to the Australian  Commonwealth for wool, and to New Zealand and the United States for  meat. Her chief wealth is in her coal and iron, and these make the  nation a great manufacturing centre. So, also, the manufacturer of New  York must go to Pittsburg for steel, to Minneapolis for flour, and to  Chicago for beef.    The application of this principle is very broad; it is the foundation of  all commerce, and it underlies modern civilization. For this reason the  question of transportation is just as important to a community as the  industries of agriculture, mining, and manufacture. Food-stuffs are of  no use unless they can be transported to the people who want them; nor  can peoples remain in unproductive regions unless the food-stuffs are  brought to them.    The gross tonnage of goods is transported mainly in one or another or  all of three ways--namely, by animal power, by railway, or by water.  Thus, the cotton-crop of the United States is usually transported by  wagon from the plantation to the nearest station or boat-landing; by  rail or by barge to the nearest seaport; and by ocean steamship to the  foreign seaport.    Water transportation is more economical than land carriage, for the  reason that less power is required to move a given tonnage through the  water than on the most perfectly graded railway. Steamship freights, as  a rule, are lower than those of sailing-vessels, because a steamship has  more than twice the speed, and, being larger, can carry a greater  tonnage. Freight rates on the Great Lakes are higher per ton-mile than  on the ocean, because the vessels are necessarily smaller than those  built for ocean traffic. For a similar reason, river and canal freights  are higher than lake freights. Railway transportation is economical,  partly because a single locomotive will draw an enormous weight of  goods, and partly because of the high speed at which the goods move from  point to point. Animal transportation is more expensive than any other  means ordinarily employed.    =Ocean Transportation.=--In many respects, water-routes form the most  available and economical methods of transportation. Intercontinental  commerce must be carried on by means of deep-water vessels. Therefore an  extraordinary development of ocean carriers has taken place in the past  century.    One important period of development began with the rise of American  commerce. Just after the close of the War for Independence, it was found  that deep-water ships could be built of New England timber for  thirty-five dollars per ton, rated tonnage, while a vessel of the same  burden built in Europe cost about forty-five dollars per unit of  tonnage. Two types of vessels came into use--one, the clipper ship with  square sails, was used for long ocean voyages; the other, the schooner,  with fore-and-aft rigging, was employed mainly in the coast-trade.    [Illustration: A SQUARE-RIGGED SHIP--A TYPE NOW BEING REPLACED BY  FORE-AND-AFT RIGGED SCHOONERS]    In speed and ease of management these vessels surpassed anything that  had ever sailed. In time they became the standards for the  sailing-vessels of all the great commercial nations. The types of the  vessels are still standards.    [Illustration: THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN STEAMSHIP]    =The Development of the Steamship.=--Another important era in ocean  commerce began when steam was used as a motive power for vessels. The  first deep-water vessel thus to be propelled was the Savannah. Her  steam-power was merely incidental, however, and her paddle-wheels were  unshipped and taken aboard when there was enough wind for sailing. Up  to 1860 almost all the ocean steamships were side-wheelers, propelled by  low-pressure beam-engines.    The next most important improvement was the screw-blade propeller,  placed astern. This means of propulsion called for higher speed of the  engines, and in a very short time compactly built high-pressure engines  took the place of the low-pressure engine with its heavy walking-beam.  The latter carried steam at a pressure varying from twenty to thirty-two  pounds; the modern boiler has steam at 260 pounds per square inch.    Ocean steamships have gradually evolved into two types. The freighter,  broad in beam and capacious, is built to carry an enormous amount of  freight at a moderate speed. The White Star liner Celtic is a vessel of  this class; her schedule time between New York and Liverpool is about  nine days. The Philadelphia of the American line, though not the fastest  steamship, makes the same trip in an average time of five and one-half  days.[7]    Twin-screws, instead of a single propeller, are employed on nearly all  the large liners. The gain in speed is not greatly increased, but the  vessel is far more manageable with two screws than with one; moreover,  if one engine breaks down, the vessel can make excellent time with the  other.    Triple-expansion engines are almost universally used on modern  steamships, and a pound of coal now makes about three times as much  steam available as in the engines formerly used. As a result a bushel of  wheat is now carried from Fargo, N. Dak., to Liverpool for about  twenty-one cents--less than one-half the freight tariff of 1876.    [Illustration: THE SCHOONER THOMAS A. LAWSON. THE FIRST SEVEN-MASTED  SAILING-VESSEL]    The fastest liners consume from three hundred and fifty to more than  four hundred tons of coal a day, and for each additional knot of speed  the amount of coal burned must be greatly increased. Freighters like the  Celtic consume scarcely more than half as much as those of the Kaiser  Wilhelm II. type.    =Sailing-Craft.=--In spite of the growth and development of  steam-navigation, a large amount of freight is still carried by  sailing-craft; moreover, it is not unlikely that the relative proportion  of ocean freight carried by sailing-vessels will increase rather than  decrease, especially in the case of imperishable freight.    The square-rigged ship, or bark, has been very largely replaced by the  fore-and-aft, or schooner-rigged vessel. A large full-rigged ship  requires a crew of thirty to thirty-six men; a schooner-rigged vessel  needs from sixteen to twenty. These vessels are commonly built with  three and four masts; some of the largest have six or seven. They carry  as many as five thousand tons of freight at a speed of about ten  knots--only a trifle less than that of an ordinary tramp freighter. Some  of the larger vessels are provided with auxiliary engines and propelling  apparatus, which enables them to enter or to leave port without the  assistance of a tug. Donkey-engines hoist and lower the sails, and  perform the work of loading and unloading. They are admirable colliers  and grain-carriers.    At the beginning of the twentieth century, about ninety thousand  sailing-craft and thirty-five thousand steam-vessels were required to  carry the world's commerce. Of this number, Great Britain and her  colonies register nearly thirty-five thousand, and the United States  over twenty thousand.         HARBOR SAFEGUARDS.--Excepting the open anchorages formed by angles       in coast-lines, the greater number of harbors consist of small       coves and river-mouths. In these, although there may be a       considerable area of water, there is not apt to be much sailing       room; it is therefore necessary to mark off the navigable channels.       For this purpose buoys of different shapes and colors are used by       day; by night fixed and flashing lights are employed.         The buoys of permanent channels are usually hollow metal cylinders       or cones about two feet in diameter, anchored so that the end of       the cylinder projects about three feet above the water. On entering       a channel from the seaward, red buoys are on the starboard, or       right hand; white buoys are kept on the port, or left side. Buoys       at the end of a channel are usually surmounted each by some device       or other fastened at the upper end of a perch. Thus, at the outer       entrance of Gedney Channel in New York Harbor, a ball surmounts the       perch; at the inner entrance the buoy carries a double square.       Sharp angles in a channel are similarly marked. In many instances       the buoy carries, as a warning signal, a bell that rings as the       buoy is rocked by the waves; in others, a whistle that sounds by       the air which the rocking motion compresses within the cylinder;       still others carry electric or gas lights.         The color of a buoy is an index of its character. Thus, one with       black and red stripes indicates danger; one with black and white       vertical stripes is a channel-marker. Temporary channels are       frequently marked by pieces of spar floating upright. In some cases       it is customary to set untrimmed tree-tops on the port, and trimmed       sticks on the starboard.         Light-houses are built at all exposed points of navigated       coast-waters, and beacons are set at all necessary points within a       harbor for use at night. All lights are kept burning from sunset       until sunrise. The color, the duration, and the intervals of       flashing indicate the position of the beacon. In revolving lights       the beams, concentrated by powerful lenses, sweep the horizon as       the lantern about the light revolves. Flashing lights are produced       when the light is obscured at given intervals. Fixed lights burn       with a steady flame. In some instances a sector of colored glass is       set so as to cover a given part of a channel. Range lights, set so       that one shows directly above the other, are used as       channel-markers.         [Illustration: CITY OF NEW YORK AND VICINITY, WITH HARBOR       APPROACHES.]         The use of lights may be seen as a vessel enters New York Lower       Bay.
