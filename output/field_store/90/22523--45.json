'I  confess,' he said, 'I trust infinitely more (according to the sound  principles of those who ever have at any time meliorated the state of  mankind) to the effect and influence of religion than to all the rest of  the regulations put together.'[22]    FOOTNOTES:    [1] The freedom was formally bestowed on him in 1863.    [2] Sir William Fraser died in 1898.    [3] Researches into the ancestry of the Gladstone family have been made  by Sir William Fraser, Professor John Veitch, and Mrs. Oliver of  Thornwood. Besides his special investigation of the genealogy of the  family, Sir W. Fraser devoted some pages in the _Douglas Book_ to the  Gledstanes of Gledstanes. The surname of Gledstanes occurs at a very  early period in the records of Scotland. Families of that name acquired  considerable landed estates in the counties of Lanark, Peebles,  Roxburgh, and Dumfries. The old castle of Gledstanes, now in ruins, was  the principal mansion of the family. The first of the name who has been  found on record is Herbert de Gledstanes, who swore fealty to Edward I.  in 1296 for lands in the county of Lanark. The Gledstanes long held the  office of bailie under the Earls of Douglas, and the connection between  the two families seems to have lasted until the fall of the Douglas  family. The Gledstanes still continued to figure for many generations on  the border. About the middle of the eighteenth century two branches of  the family--the Gledstanes of Cocklaw and of Craigs--failed in the  direct male line. Mr. Gladstone was descended from a third branch, the  Gledstanes of Arthurshiel in Lanarkshire. The first of this line who has  been traced is William Gledstanes, who in the year 1551 was laird of  Arthurshiel. His lineal descendants continued as owners of that property  till William Gledstanes disposed of it and went to live in the town of  Biggar about the year 1679. This William Gledstanes was Mr. Gladstone's  great-great-grandfather. The connection between these three branches and  Herbert de Gledstanes of 1296 has not been ascertained, but he was  probably the common ancestor of them all.    [4] John Gladstone built St. Thomas's Church, Seaforth, 1814-15; St.  Andrew's, Liverpool, about 1816; the church at Leith; the Episcopal  chapel at Fasque built and endowed about 1847.    [5] Charles Simeon (1759-1836), who played as conspicuous a part in low  church thought as Newman afterwards in high.    [6] See below, pp. 106-7.    [7] XII 58--'Removed from death by four or maybe seven fingers'  breadth.'    [8] The fragment is undated.    [9] One or two further genealogical _nugae_ are among the papers. A  correspondent wrote to Mr. Gladstone in 1887: Among the donors to the  Craftsman's Hospital, Aberdeen, established in 1833, occurs the name of  'Georg Gladstaines, pewterer, 300 merks' (L16, 13s. 4d. sterling), 1698.  George joined the Hammerman Craft in 1656, when he would have been about  25 years of age. His signature is still in existence appended to the  burgess oath. Very few craftsmen could sign their names at that  period--not one in twenty--so that George must have been fairly well  educated. Mr. Gladstone replied that it was the first time that he had  heard of the name so far north, and that the pewterer was probably one  planted out. At Dundee (1890) he mentioned that others of his name and  blood appeared on the burgess-roll as early as the fifteenth century. As  for his maternal grandfather, the _Inverness Courier_ (March 2, year not  given) has the following:--'Provost Robertson of Dingwall was a  descendant of the ancient family of the Robertsons of Inshes, of whose  early settlement in the north the following particulars are known: The  first was a member of the family of Struan, Perthshire, and was a  merchant in Inverness in 1420. In the battle of _Blair-na-leine_, fought  at the west end of Loch-Lochy in 1544, John Robertson, a descendant of  the above, acted as standard-bearer to Lord Lovat. This battle was  fought between the Frasers and Macdonalds of Clanranald, and derived its  appellation from the circumstance of the combatants fighting only in  their shirts. The contest was carried on with such bloody determination,  foot to foot and claymore to claymore, that only _four_ of the Frasers  and _ten_ of the Macdonalds returned to tell the tale. The former family  was well nigh extirpated; tradition, however, states that sixteen widows  of the Frasers who had been slain, shortly afterwards, as a providential  succour, gave birth to sixteen sons! From the bloody onslaught at  Loch-Lochy young Robertson returned home scaithless, and his brave and  gallant conduct was the theme of praise with all. Some time thereafter  he married the second daughter of Paterson of Wester and Easter Inshes,  the eldest being married to Cuthbert of Macbeth's Castlehill, now known  as the Crown lands, possessed by Mr. Fraser of Abertarff. On the death  of Paterson, his father-in-law, Wester Inshes became the property of  young Robertson, and Easter Inshes that of the Cuthberts, who, for the  sake of distinction, changed the name to Castlehill. The Robertsons, in  regular succession until the present time, possess the fine estate of  Inshes; while that of Castlehill, which belonged to the powerful  Cuthberts for so many generations, knows them no more. The family of  Inshes, in all ages, stood high in respect throughout the highlands, and  many of them had signalised themselves in upholding the rights of their  country; and the worthy Provost Robertson of Dingwall had no less  distinguished himself, who, with other important reforms, had cleared  away the last burdensome relic of feudal times in that ancient burgh.'    [10] The other sons and daughters of this marriage were Thomas, _d._  1889; Robertson, _d._ 1875; John Neilson, _d._ 1863; Anne, _d._ 1829;  Helen Jane, _d._ 1880.    [11] At Dundee, Oct. 29, 1890.    [12] In 1835 formal difficulties arose in connection with the purchase  of a government annuity, and then he seems to have taken out letters  patent authorising the change in the name.

[17] In Demerara the average price of slaves from 1822 to 1830 had been  L114, 11s. 51/4d. The rate of compensation per slave averaged L51, 17s.  1/2d., but it is of interest to note that the slaves on the Vreedenhoop  estate were valued at L53, 15s. 6d.    [18] _Dict. Nat.

There are rare and splendid exceptions, to be sure, but in my       conscience I believe, that England would not be what she is without       her system of public education, and that no other country can       become what England is, without the advantages of such a       system.--CANNING.         It is difficult to discern the true dimensions of objects in that       mirage which covers the studies of one's youth.--GLADSTONE.      In September 1821, the young Gladstone was sent to Eton. Life at Eton  lasted over six years, until the Christmas of 1827. It impressed images  that never faded, and left traces in heart and mind that the waves of  time never effaced,--so profound is the early writing on our opening  page. Canning's words at the head of our present chapter set forth a  superstition that had a powerful hold on the English governing class of  that day, and the new Etonian never shook it off. His attachment to Eton  grew with the lapse of years; to him it was ever 'the queen of all  schools.'    'I went,' he says, 'under the wing of my eldest brother, then in the  upper division, and this helped my start and much mitigated the sense of  isolation that attends the first launch at a public school.' The door of  his dame's house looked down the Long Walk, while the windows looked  into the very crowded churchyard: from this he never received the  smallest inconvenience, though it was his custom (when master of the  room)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],[0,"Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#7)"],[1,"was a moment's silence, then she repeated in a tone of the utmost  solemnity--    \"The country is very pretty and undulating--you are quite right.  Your  remark is most apt!  May I ask if you would object to my repeating it to  my friend over here?  She would be so very much interested.\"    She was so preternaturally grave, that for a moment Rhoda was taken in  by the pretence, the next she flushed angrily, and tilted her head in  the air, but it was of no avail, for already the next girl was tittering  over the quotation, and turning to repeat it in her turn.  The simple  words must surely contain some hidden joke, for on hearing it each  listener was seized with a paroxysm of laughter, and face after face  peered forward to stare at the originator, and chuckle with renewed  mirth.  It was a good ten minutes before it had travelled round the  carriage and been digested by each separate traveller, and then, so far  from dying out, it acquired fresh life from being adapted to passing  circumstances, as when the train having stopped at a junction and moved  on again with a jerk, Square Face fell prone into her companion's arms,  and excused herself with a bland--    \"Excuse me, dear.  It's my little way.  I _am_ so pretty and  undulating,\" and instantly the titters burst out afresh.    Rhoda's face was a study, but even as she sat fuming with passion, a  voice spoke in her ear from the side where Brown Eyes still studied her  advertisements.    \"Laugh, can't you?\" said the voice.  \"Laugh, too, as if you enjoyed the  joke.  It's the only way.  They will go on all the more if they see you  are angry.\"    \"I hate them all!\" hissed Rhoda savagely, and the other heaved a sigh.    \"Ah, so do I, but they shan't hate me if I know it!  I'm sorry I  snapped, but I'll talk now, and for pity's sake don't look so dismal.  Let us look over this paper together, and make remarks, and smile as if  we were enjoying ourselves too.\"    \"I don't feel as if I should ever enjoy myself again.  It's hateful  going to school.  If I had known it was as bad as this I would never  have come.\"    \"There's a lake in the grounds.  We will drown ourselves together after  tea, but in the meantime do please keep up appearances.  Don't give  yourself away before all these girls!\"    Rhoda looked at her curiously, and felt a thrill of comfort at finding a  friend in the midst of her desolation.  \"What is your name?\" she queried  eagerly, and the dark eyes met hers in a solemn stare.    \"Marah, for bitterness.  That's how I feel to-day, anyhow.  My  godmothers and godfather christened me Dorothy, and in festive moments I  have even answered to `Doll,' but I'd murder any one who called me that  to-day.  Now, I'll show you something interesting...  I've travelled on  this line before, and if you look out of the window you can catch a  glimpse of Hurst Manor as we pass the next station.  It stands in its  own grounds with nothing between it and the line.  Over there to the  right--you can't miss it if you keep your eyes open.  Now!  There!  That  gaunt, grey building.\"    Rhoda looked, and there it lay--a gaunt building, indeed, with row upon  row of tall, bare windows staring like so many eyes, and out-standing  wings flanked like sentinels on either side.  The poor recruit's face  lengthened with horror.    \"It looks,\" she said dismally, \"like a prison!  It looks as if when you  once got in, you would never never get out any more!\"        CHAPTER FIVE.    FIRST IMPRESSIONS.    Ten minutes later the journey came to an end, and the girls surged out  on to the platform of the country station.  A line of waggonettes,  cheerfully denominated \"Black Marias\" by the pupils, was in waiting, and  with less confusion than might have been expected the girls divided into  different parties, and seated themselves in the carriages marked with  their own house colours.  Rhoda and her travelling companions, being all  \"blue,\" were among the first to drive off, each girl clutching the  handbag which contained the immediate necessities of her toilet, and  chattering away at the pitch of her voice.  \"Square Face\" was evidently  the wag of the party, and was treated with an admiring deference which  seemed to bespeak a position of importance.  She was professionally  addressed as \"Tom,\" and Rhoda from her seat opposite, read the words,  \"Thomasina Bolderston,\" upon the label of the bag, and reflected that  she had never heard a name more entirely appropriate to its owner.  It  was at once so ugly, so uncommon, and so arresting to the memory, while  Tom herself, once seen, could never be forgotten, nor confounded with  another girl.  There she sat, the keen autumn air blanching her cheeks  and reddening her eyes, her arms crossed squarely over her bag, her lips  twitching with mischievous enjoyment.  She had but to roll her eyes, and  the girls went into fresh convulsions of laughter; and when, at the  entrance to \"Hurst\" grounds, she took out her handkerchief and affected  to sob, the merriment reached an almost hysterical pitch.  Rhoda,  however, failed to appreciate the humour of the joke, being inclined to  cry in good truth as the grim doorway yawned before her, and she caught  a glimpse of the chill, grey hall, so different from the glowing warmth  of her own dear home.    Dorothy gripped her arm in sympathetic fashion as they alighted and fell  into position in the long line of girls, who had suddenly thrown off  their hoyden airs, and assumed a demeanour of severe propriety.  The  queue wended its serpentine course down the hall itself, and across a  smaller corridor to the head of the great staircase, where stood a lady  in a black silk dress, and a cap with lavender ribbons, crowning bands  of iron-grey hair.  She was in reality small of stature, but she held  herself with an air which gave her the appearance of being six feet high  at least, and as she shook hands with each girl she addressed to her a  word of greeting.    \"How do you do, Mary?  Glad to see you, Kathleen.  Hope you are better,  Ella.  Welcome back, Carrie!\" and so on, and so on.  Occasionally there  came a hesitation, and the greeting terminated without a name being  added, but whenever this was the case there was a knitting of the brows  which showed distinct annoyance.  Miss Bruce evidently took a pride in  remembering her pupils, and was hard on herself for any forgetfulness.  When it came to the turn of the new girls, she detained them a moment to  hope they would be happy, before waving them forward with an encouraging  smile.    \"That's what we call being `presented.'  She is the Queen, and on the  next landing are `the Lords,' and on the second `the Commons,'\"  whispered a girl, who being herself only in her second term was not  averse from posing as preceptor.  Rhoda lifted her eyes and beheld an  array of governesses standing before her, shaking hands and welcoming  the pupils in their turn.  Some looked formidable and learned, some did  not.  Some had the orthodox braided locks and spectacles, some even  condescended to the frivolity of a `fringe,' but one and all bore  themselves with a dignity worthy of a foremost position in the newest of  all new schools.    Rhoda passed by as in a dream, and felt far more interest in \"the  Commons,\" who were for the most part young women removed from girlhood  by so slight a barrier that there was a tone of comradeship in their  voices, a sympathetic understanding in their glance.  The sweetest  looking of all was evidently in special charge of the Blues, and, walked  by the side of the two new girls as the detachment filed along the  endless corridor towards its own apartments.    \"You two are sisters?  No!  Ah, well, you must pretend you are, for a  day or two at least, until you get over the first loneliness.  Every one  feels lonely at first among such a crowd of strangers, but it soon  passes, and we are very happy together.  You must come and sit with me  in my little den sometimes.  I'll ask you to tea on Sunday, and you must  always come to me if you are in any difficulty.  In the meantime do as  the other girls do, and you will get along quite easily.  You are in the  same room.  Wash and get ready for tea at once.  The gong will ring in  half an hour, and after that your boxes will have arrived and you will  be able to unpack.\"    They reached the door of the dormitory as she finished speaking, and the  girls entered, trying not to feel as if they were being introduced to a  prison cell, or to be unduly cast down because they were separated by  half the length of the room.    \"If we could have been next each other and just wobbled the curtain  occasionally it would have been friendly!\" sighed Rhoda, sinking down on  the solitary chair and gazing forlornly round her new abode.  A bed, a  wash-stand, a chest of drawers with a glass on top, a small fixture  wardrobe, and about three yards of space on which to disport her own  fair self--different quarters, indeed, from her room at home, with its  spacious floor, its deep bay windows, its adjoining dressing-room and  bathroom!  When the curtains were drawn there was a feeling of cramped  confinement which was most depressing to the spirits; yet, as her eye  took in one detail after the other, Rhoda realised that there were  redeeming points in the situation.  Small as it was, the cubicle was  decidedly pretty, and blue enough to satisfy the blondest of mistresses.  Blue was the paint on the walls, blue the mat on the floor, blue and  white the coverlet on the bed, blue the quaintly shaped china on the  wash-stand.  She remembered with a thrill of satisfaction that her own  bags and cases were of the same hue, and took off her hat feeling that  she had found an oasis in the desert of life.    Half-an-hour seemed a long time to prepare for tea, when no change of  garment was possible, but it passed so quickly that the sound of the  gong came as a surprise, and she emerged from her"]]]
