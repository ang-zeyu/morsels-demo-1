And the curious thing is that book-collecting  was gradually passing away from the monks, and becoming exceedingly  popular with the laity. 'Flocks and fleeces, crops and herds, gardens  and orchards, the wine of the winecup, are the only books and studies of  the monks.' The Franciscans, who (like the Dominicans) came to England  in 1224, were expressly forbidden 'the possession of books or the  necessary materials for study.' When Roger Bacon joined this order, he  was deprived of his books. St. Francis himself, it seems, was once  'tempted to possess books'--by honest means, let us hope, although the  point is not quite clear--and he almost yielded to the temptation, but  finally decided that it would be sinful. The plague of books seems to  have troubled this poor saint's soul, for he hoped that the day would  come when men would throw their books out of the window as rubbish.    [Illustration: _Lambeth Palace Library._]    In proof of the theory that laymen at a very early period became  book-collectors, the most interesting example which we can quote is that  of Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who died in 1315, and who  bequeathed his library to Bordesley Abbey, Worcestershire, where it had  already been deposited during his lifetime. Beginning with this  preamble, 'A tus iceux qe ceste lettre verront ou orrount. Guy de  Beauchamp, Comte de Warr. Saluz en Deu. Nous avoir bayle e en lagarde le  Abbe e le covent de Bordesleye, lesse a demorer a touz jours les  Romaunces de souz nomes; ces est assaveyr,' the bequest recites, with  great minuteness, a remarkably interesting list of books. This list  ('escrites ou Bordesleye le premer jour de may, le an du regn le Roy  Edw{d} trentime quart') is in the Lambeth Library, but it is reprinted  by Todd in his 'Illustrations of Gower and Chaucer,' pp. 161, 162. This  list is of more than ordinary interest, chiefly because the collection  formed by a layman gives us a very good insight into the class of books  which the early nobility of England read, or, at all events, collected.  Religious books, of course, formed the background of the library, but  there were many romances, such, for instance, as those of King Arthur,  of 'Josep alb Arimathie e deu Seint Grael,' of 'Troies,' etc. There was  also a book 'De Phisik et de Surgie.'    This collection contained between forty and fifty volumes, in which was  included pretty nearly the entire range of human knowledge as it then  extended. It is well to remember in connection with this bequest that,  at the same time, or, more correctly, in 1300, the academical library of  Oxford consisted of a few tracts kept in chests under St. Mary's Church.    With the greatest book-collector of this period, Richard de Bury  (1287-1345), the author of the 'Philobiblon,' unfortunately, we have  little to do, as his book expeditions appear to have been confined  almost entirely to foreign countries. He collected books from every  source open to him, and wrote of his passion with a warmth of eloquence  of which even Cicero might have been proud. His most important book  transaction, which comes within the purview of the present volume,  relates to the gift by an Abbot of St. Albans of four volumes to De  Bury, then Clerk of the Privy Seal, viz., Terence, Virgil, Quintilian,  and Hieronymus against Rufinus. In addition to these, the Abbot sold him  thirty-two other books for fifty pounds of silver. When De Bury became  Bishop this 'gift' troubled his conscience, and he restored several of  the books which had come into his possession in a perfectly honest and  legitimate manner, whilst others were secured from the Bishop's  executors. One of the volumes acquired in the latter manner is now in  the British Museum. It is a large folio MS. on the works of John of  Salisbury, and bears upon it a note to the effect that it was written by  Simon (Abbot of St. Albans, 1167-1183), and another to the following  effect: 'Hunc librum venditum Domino Ricardo de Biry Episcopo Dunelmensi  emit Michael Abbas Sancti Albani ab executoribus predicti episcopi anno  Domini millesimo ccc{o} xlv{to} circa purificationem Beate Virginis.'    The catalogue of the library of the Benedictine monastery of Christ  Church, Canterbury, in the Cottonian Collection, British Museum, and  printed for the first time at length in Edward's 'Memoirs of Libraries'  (i. 122-235), is a remarkable list of the most extensive collection of  books at that time in this country. It was formed at the end of the  thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century. This library was  well furnished with works in science and history, and particularly so  with the classics--Aristotle, Cicero, Lucan, Plato, Suetonius, Seneca,  Terence, and Virgil. The extreme probability is that London was the  highway through which the greater part of this and other early libraries  passed. If, early in the fifteenth century, the book-hunter in London  possessed few opportunities of purchasing books, he would have found  several very good libraries which were open to his inspection. There  was, for example, a very considerable collection in the Franciscan  monastery, which once stood on the site now occupied by Christ's  Hospital, Newgate Street. The first stone of this monastery was laid in  October, 1421, amid much pomp, by the then Lord Mayor, Sir Richard  Whittington, who gave L400 in books. It was covered in before the winter  of 1422, and completed in three years, and furnished with books. From  Stow's 'Survey' we learn that one hundred marks were expended on the  transcription of the works of Nicholas de Lira, to be chained in the  library, and of which cost John Frensile remitted 20s. One of the  chained books, 'The Lectures of Hostiensis,' cost five marks. From  another source we learn that a Carmelite friar named John Wallden  bequeathed to this library as many MSS. as were worth 2,000 pieces of  gold.    Anthony a Wood refers to the oft-repeated charge of the  book-covetousness of the mendicant friars, which, in fact, was carried  to such an extreme 'that wise men looked upon it as an injury to laymen,  who therefore found a difficulty to get any books.' Of the same period,  there is a very curious anecdote in Rymer's 'Foedera' about taking off  the duty upon six barrels of books sent by a Roman cardinal to the Prior  of the conventual church of St. Trinity, Norwich. These barrels, which  lay at the Custom-house, were imported duty free.    Neither the book-hunger of the mendicant friars, nor the difficulties  which surrounded the importation of books, appears to have militated  greatly against the growing passion. We have the name, and only the  name, of a very famous book-hunter--John of Boston--of the first decade  of the fifteenth century, whose labours, however, have been completely  blotted out of existence by the dispersed monasteries. But there were  many other collectors whose memories have been handed down to us in a  more tangible form, even if their collections of books are almost as  abstract and indefinite as that of John of Boston. During the first  quarter of the fifteenth century, we have quite a considerable little  group of royal book-collectors--Henry IV., Henry V., and his brothers,  John, Duke of Bedford, and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. The last-named  was undoubtedly the most enthusiastic bibliophile of the four, but  whilst his extensive gifts of books to the University of Oxford may be  said to have formed the foundation of the library there, they were in  the following century destroyed by the mob. A few examples of his gifts  are now preserved in the British Museum and at Oxford. His books were  estimated at a very high figure, the value placed on 120 of them (out of  the total of 600) being no less than L1,000. The memory of the Duke of  Bedford's library is best perpetuated by the famous Bedford Missal, or  Book of Hours, perhaps the most splendid example of fifteenth-century  illustration. It is now in the British Museum, where it has been since  1852. The history of this missal, perhaps the most interesting in  existence, is too well known to be dealt with here (see p. 109).    Henry V. was undoubtedly fond of books. Rymer refers to two petitions to  the Council after the King's death for the return of valuable books of  history, borrowed by him of the Countess of Westmoreland, and of the  priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, and not returned, though one of  them had been directed to be delivered to its owner by the King's last  will. The elegantly illuminated copy of Lydgate's 'Hystory, Sege, and  Destruccion of Troye,' 1513, in the Bodleian, is doubtless the copy  which Lydgate gave to Henry V. At Cambridge there is the MS. of a French  translation of Cardinal Bonaventure's 'Life of Christ,' with the note  'this wasse sumtyme Kinge Henri the fifeth his booke,' etc.    Henry VI. does not appear to have cared for books, and it is not  surprising, what with wars abroad and excessive taxation, plague and  famine at home, that literary tastes received a severe check. We get  several glimpses of the dearth of books. In the MS. history of Eton  College, in the British Museum, the Provost and Fellows of Eton and  Cambridge are stated, 25 Henry VI., to have petitioned the King that he  would be pleased to order one of his chaplains, Richard Chestre, 'to  take to him such men as shall be seen to him expedient in order to get  knowledge where such bookes [for Divine service] may be found, paying a  reasonable price for the same, and that the sayd men might have the  choice of such bookes, ornaments, and other necessaries as now late were  perteynyng to the Duke of Gloucester, and that the king would  particular[ly] cause to be employed herein John Pye--his stacioner of  London.'    Book-importation by the galleys that brought the produce of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22608"],[0,"A Book for All Readers (#7)"],[1,"years in vain. In any  case, you will have acquired valuable information--whether you acquire  any books or not; since there is hardly a priced catalogue, of any  considerable extent, from which you cannot reap knowledge of some  kind--knowledge of editions, knowledge of prices, and knowledge of the  comparative scarcity or full supply of many books, with a glimpse of  titles which you may never have met before. The value of the study of  catalogues as an education in bibliography can never be over-estimated.    The large number of active and discriminating book-buyers from America  has for years past awakened the interest and jealousy of collectors  abroad, where it has very largely enhanced the price of all first-class  editions, and rare works.    No longer, as in the early days of Dibdin and Heber, is the competition  for the curiosities of old English literature confined to a half-score of  native amateurs. True, we have no such omnivorous gatherers of literary  rubbish as that magnificent _helluo librorum_, Richard Heber, who amassed  what was claimed to be the largest collection of books ever formed by a  single individual. Endowed with a princely fortune, and an undying  passion for the possession of books, he spent nearly a million dollars in  their acquisition. His library, variously stated at from 105,000 volumes  (by Dr. Dibdin) to 146,000 volumes (by Dr. Allibone) was brought to the  hammer in 1834. The catalogue filled 13 octavo volumes, and the sale  occupied 216 days. The insatiable owner (who was a brother of Reginald  Heber, Bishop of Calcutta) died while still collecting, at the age of  sixty, leaving his enormous library, which no single house of ordinary  size could hold, scattered in half a dozen mansions in London, Oxford,  Paris, Antwerp, Brussels and Ghent.    Yet the owner of this vast mass of mingled nonsense and erudition, this  library of the curiosities of literature, was as generous in imparting as  in acquiring his literary treasures. No English scholar but was freely  welcome to the loan of his volumes; and his own taste and critical  knowledge are said to have been of the first order.    From this, probably the most extensive private library ever gathered, let  us turn to the largest single purchase, in number of volumes, made at one  time for a public library. When Dr. J. G. Cogswell went abroad in 1848,  to lay the foundations of the Astor Library, he took with him credentials  for the expenditure of $100,000; and, what was of even greater  importance, a thoroughly digested catalogue of _desiderata_, embracing  the most important books in every department of literature and science.  No such opportunity of buying the finest books at the lowest prices is  likely ever to occur again, as the fortuitous concourse of events brought  to Dr. Cogswell. It was the year of revolutions--the year when the  thrones were tottering or falling all over Europe, when the wealthy and  privileged classes were trembling for their possessions, and anxious to  turn them into ready money. In every time of panic, political or  financial, the prices of books, as well as of all articles of luxury, are  the first to fall. Many of the choicest collections came to the hammer;  multitudes were eager to sell--but there were few buyers except the book  merchants, who were all ready to sell again. The result was that some  80,000 volumes were gathered for the Astor Library, embracing a very  large share of the best editions and the most expensive works, with many  books strictly denominated rare, and nearly all bound in superior style,  at an average cost of about $1.40 per volume. This extraordinary good  fortune enabled the Astor Library to be opened on a very small endowment,  more splendidly equipped for a library of reference than any new  institution could be today with four or five times the money.    Compared with such opportunities as these, you may consider the  experiences of the little libraries, and the narrow means of recruitment  generally found, as very literally the day of small things. But a wise  apportionment of small funds, combined with a good knowledge of the  commercial value of books, and perpetual vigilance in using  opportunities, will go very far toward enlarging any collection in the  most desirable directions.    Compare for a moment with the results stated of the Astor Library's early  purchases, the average prices paid by British Libraries for books  purchased from 1826 to 1854, as published in a parliamentary return. The  average cost per volume varied from 16_s_ or about $4 a volume, for the  University Library of Edinburgh, to 4_s_ 6_d_, or $1.10 a volume for the  Manchester Free Library. The latter, however, were chiefly popular new  books, published at low prices, while the former included many costly old  works, law books, etc. The British Museum Library's average was 8_s_ 5_d_  or about $2.00 per volume. Those figures represent cloth binding, while  the Astor's purchases were mostly in permanent leather bindings.    Averages are very uncertain standards of comparison, as a single book  rarity often costs more than a hundred volumes of the new books of the  day; but in a library filled with the best editions of classical and  scientific works, and reference books, I presume that two dollars a  volume is not too high an estimate of average cost, in these days  represented by the last twenty years. For a circulating library, on the  other hand, composed chiefly of what the public most seek to read, half  that average would perhaps express the full commercial value of the  collection. Of its intrinsic value I will not here pause to speak.    There are many methods of book buying, of which we may indicate the  principal as follows:        1. By direct orders from book dealers.      2. By competition on select lists of wants.      3. By order from priced catalogues.      4. By purchase at auction sales.      5. By personal research among book stocks.      6. By lists and samples of books sent on approval.    Each of these methods has its advantages--and, I may add, its  disadvantages likewise. The collector who combines them, as opportunity  presents, is most likely to make his funds go the farthest, and to enrich  his collection the most. Direct orders for purchase are necessary for  most new books wanted, except in the case of the one government library,  which in most countries, receives them under copyright provision. An  advantageous arrangement can usually be made with one or more  book-dealers, to supply all new books at a fairly liberal discount from  retail prices. And it is wise management to distribute purchases where  good terms are made, as thereby the trade will feel an interest in the  library, and a mutuality of interest will secure more opportunities and  better bargains.    The submission of lists of books wanted, to houses having large stocks or  good facilities, helps to make funds go as far as possible through  competition. By the typewriter such lists can now be manifolded much more  cheaply than they can be written or printed.    Selection from priced catalogues presents a constantly recurring  opportunity of buying volumes of the greatest consequence, to fill gaps  in any collection, and often at surprisingly low prices. Much as book  values have been enhanced of late years, there are yet catalogues issued  by American, English and continental dealers which quote books both of  the standard and secondary class at very cheap rates. Even now English  books are sold by the Mudie and the W. H. Smith lending libraries in  London, after a very few months, at one-half to one-fourth their original  publishing price. These must usually be rebound, but by instructing your  agent to select copies which are clean within, all the soil of the edges  will disappear with the light trimming of the binder.    Purchase at auction supplies a means of recruiting libraries both public  and private with many rare works, and with the best editions of the  standard authors, often finely bound. The choice private libraries of the  country, as well as the poor ones, tend to pour themselves sooner or  later into public auctions. The collectors of books, whose early avidity  to amass libraries of fine editions was phenomenal, rarely persist in  cultivating the passion through life. Sometimes they are overtaken by  misfortune--sometimes by indifference--the bibliomania not being a  perennial inspiration, but often an acute and fiery attack, which in a  few years burns out. Even if the library gathered with so much money and  pains descends to the heirs of the collector, the passion for books is  very seldom an inherited one. Thus the public libraries are constantly  recruited by the opportunities of selection furnished by the forced sale  of the private ones. Here, public competition frequently runs up the  price of certain books to an exorbitant degree, while those not wanted  often sell for the merest trifle. One should have a pretty clear idea of  the approximate commercial value of books, before competing for them at  public sale. He may, however, if well persuaded in his own mind as to the  importance or the relative unimportance to his own collection of any  work, regulate his bids by that standard, regardless of commercial value,  except as a limit beyond which he will not go. Few librarians can  personally attend auction sales--nor is it needful, when limits can so  easily be set to orders. It is never safe to send an unlimited bid, as  there may be others without limit, in which case the book is commonly  awarded to the most remote bidder.    There are many curiosities of the auction room, one of them being the  frequent re-appearance of book rarities which have been through several  auctions, sometimes at intervals of years, keenly competed for by rival  bibliophiles, and carried off in triumph by some ardent collector, who  little thought at the time how soon his"]]]
