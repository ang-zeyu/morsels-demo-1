From the moment that Magdalen Crawford's haunting eyes had looked  straight into his for one fleeting second, an unnamable thrill of pain  and pleasure stirred his heart, a thrill so strong and sudden and  passionate that his face paled with emotion; the room seemed to swim  before his eyes in a mist out of which gleamed that wonderful face  with its mesmeric, darkly radiant eyes, burning their way into deeps  and abysses of his soul hitherto unknown to him.    When the mist cleared away and his head grew steadier, he wondered at  himself. Yet he trembled in every limb and the only clear idea that  struggled out of his confused thoughts was an overmastering desire to  take that cold face between his hands and kiss it until its  passionless marble glowed into warm and throbbing life.    \"Who is that girl?\" he said abruptly, when they had left the cottage.  \"She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen--present company  always excepted,\" he concluded, with a depreciatory laugh.    The delicate bloom on Marian's face deepened slightly.    \"You had much better to have omitted that last sentence,\" she said  quietly, \"it was so palpably an afterthought. Yes, she is wonderfully  lovely--a strange beauty, I fancied. There seemed something odd and  uncanny about it to me. She must be Mrs. Barrett's niece. I remember  that when I was down here about a month ago Mrs. Barrett told me she  expected a niece of hers to live with her--for a time at least. Her  parents were both dead, the father having died recently. Mrs. Barrett  seemed troubled about her. She said that the girl had been well  brought up and used to better things than the Cove could give her, and  she feared that she would be very discontented and unhappy. I had  forgotten all about it until I saw the girl today. She certainly seems  to be a very superior person; she will find the Cove very lonely, I am  sure. It is not probable she will stay there long. I must see what I  can do for her, but her manner seemed rather repellent, don't you  think?\"    \"Hardly,\" responded Esterbrook curtly. \"She seemed surprisingly  dignified and self-possessed, I fancied, for a girl in her position. A  princess could not have looked and bowed more royally. There was not a  shadow of embarrassment in her manner, in spite of the incongruity of  her surroundings. You had much better leave her alone, Marian. In all  probability she would resent any condescension on your part. What  wonderful, deep, lovely eyes she has.\"    Again the sensitive colour flushed Marian's cheek as his voice lapsed  unconsciously into a dreamy, retrospective tone, and a slight  restraint came over her manner, which did not depart. Esterbrook went  away at sunset. Marian asked him to remain for the evening, but he  pleaded some excuse.    \"I shall come tomorrow afternoon,\" he said, as he stooped to drop a  careless good-bye kiss on her face.    Marian watched him wistfully as he rode away, with an unaccountable  pain in her heart. She felt more acutely than ever that there were  depths in her lover's nature that she was powerless to stir into  responsive life.    Had any other that power? She thought of the girl at the Cove, with  her deep eyes and wonderful face. A chill of premonitory fear seized  upon her.    \"I feel exactly as if Esterbrook had gone away from me forever,\" she  said slowly to herself, stooping to brush her cheek against a  dew-cold, milk-white acacia bloom, \"and would never come back to me  again. If that could happen, I wonder what there would be left to live  for?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Esterbrook Elliott meant, or honestly thought he meant, to go home  when he left Marian. Nevertheless, when he reached the road branching  off to the Cove he turned his horse down it with a flush on his dark  cheek. He realized that the motive of the action was disloyal to  Marian and he felt ashamed of his weakness.    But the desire to see Magdalen Crawford once more and to look into the  depths of her eyes was stronger than all else, and overpowered every  throb of duty and resistance.    He saw nothing of her when he reached the Cove. He could think of no  excuse for calling at the Barrett cottage, so he rode slowly past the  hamlet and along the shore.    The sun, red as a smouldering ember, was half buried in the silken  violet rim of the sea; the west was a vast lake of saffron and rose  and ethereal green, through which floated the curved shallop of a thin  new moon, slowly deepening from lustreless white, through gleaming  silver, into burnished gold, and attended by one solitary, pearl-white  star. The vast concave of sky above was of violet, infinite and  flawless. Far out dusky amethystine islets clustered like gems on the  shining breast of the bay. The little pools of water along the low  shores glowed like mirrors of polished jacinth. The small,  pine-fringed headlands ran out into the water, cutting its lustrous  blue expanse like purple wedges.    As Esterbrook turned one of them he saw Magdalen standing out on the  point of the next, a short distance away. Her back was towards him,  and her splendid figure was outlined darkly against the vivid sky.    Esterbrook sprang from his horse and left the animal standing by  itself while he walked swiftly out to her. His heart throbbed  suffocatingly. He was conscious of no direct purpose save merely to  see her.    She turned when he reached her with a slight start of surprise. His  footsteps had made no sound on the tide-rippled sand.    For a few moments they faced each other so, eyes burning into eyes  with mute soul-probing and questioning. The sun had disappeared,  leaving a stain of fiery red to mark his grave; the weird, radiant  light was startlingly vivid and clear. Little crisp puffs and flakes  of foam scurried over the point like elfin things. The fresh wind,  blowing up the bay, tossed the lustrous rings of hair about Magdalen's  pale face; all the routed shadows of the hour had found refuge in her  eyes.    Not a trace of colour appeared in her face under Esterbrook Elliott's  burning gaze. But when he said \"Magdalen!\" a single, hot scorch of  crimson flamed up into her cheeks protestingly. She lifted her hand  with a splendid gesture, but no word passed her lips.    \"Magdalen, have you nothing to say to me?\" he asked, coming closer to  her with an imploring passion in his face never seen by Marian  Lesley's eyes. He reached out his hand, but she stepped back from his  touch.    \"What should I have to say to you?\"    \"Say that you are glad to see me.\"    \"I am not glad to see you. You have no right to come here. But I knew  you would come.\"    \"You knew it? How?\"    \"Your eyes told me so today. I am not blind--I can see further than  those dull fisher folks. Yes, I knew you would come. That is why I  came here tonight--so that you would find me alone and I could tell  you that you were not to come again.\"    \"Why must you tell me that, Magdalen?\"    \"Because, as I have told you, you have no right to come.\"    \"But if I will not obey you? If I will come in defiance of your  prohibition?\"    She turned her steady luminous eyes on his pale, set face.    \"You would stamp yourself as a madman, then,\" she said coldly. \"I know  that you are Miss Lesley's promised husband. Therefore, you are either  false to her or insulting to me. In either case the companionship of  Magdalen Crawford is not what you must seek. Go!\"    She turned away from him with an imperious gesture of dismissal.  Esterbrook Elliott stepped forward and caught one firm, white wrist.    \"I shall not obey you,\" he said in a low, intense tone; his fine eyes  burned into hers. \"You may send me away, but I will come back, again  and yet again until you have learned to welcome me. Why should you  meet me like an enemy? Why can we not be friends?\"    The girl faced him once more.    \"Because,\" she said proudly, \"I am not your equal. There can be no  friendship between us. There ought not to be. Magdalen Crawford, the  fisherman's niece, is no companion for you. You will be foolish, as  well as disloyal, if you ever try to see me again. Go back to the  beautiful, high-bred woman you love and forget me. Perhaps you think I  am talking strangely. Perhaps you think me bold and unwomanly to speak  so plainly to you, a stranger. But there are some circumstances in  life when plain-speaking is best. I do not want to see you again. Now,  go back to your own world.\"    Esterbrook Elliott slowly turned from her and walked in silence back  to the shore. In the shadows of the point he stopped to look back at  her, standing out like some inspired prophetess against the fiery  background of the sunset sky and silver-blue water. The sky overhead  was thick-sown with stars; the night breeze was blowing up from its  lair in distant, echoing sea caves. On his right the lights of the  Cove twinkled out through the dusk.    \"I feel like a coward and a traitor,\" he said slowly. \"Good God, what  is this madness that has come over me? Is this my boasted strength of  manhood?\"    A moment later the hoof beats of his horse died away up the shore.    Magdalen Crawford lingered on the point until the last dull red faded  out into the violet gloom of the June sea dusk, than which nothing can  be rarer or diviner, and listened to the moan and murmur of the sea  far out over the bay with sorrowful eyes and sternly set lips.    The next day, when the afternoon sun hung hot and heavy over the  water, Esterbrook Elliott came again to the Cove. He found it  deserted. A rumour of mackerel had come, and every boat had sailed  out in the rose-red dawn to the fishing grounds. But down on a strip  of sparkling yellow sand he saw Magdalen Crawford standing, her hand  on the rope that fastened a small white dory to the fragment"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24875"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1904 (#7)"],[1,"Worth set out for Greenwood, a  mile away.    \"Oh, what will Paul say?\" exclaimed the aunts, with dismal  forebodings.    Worth met her Uncle Paul at the garden gate. He was standing there  when she came up the slope of the long lane, a tall, massive figure of  a man, with deep-set black eyes, a long, prematurely white beard, and  a hooked nose. Handsome and stubborn enough Paul Ingelow looked. It  was not without reason that his neighbours called him the oddest  Ingelow of them all.    Behind him was a fine old farmhouse in beautiful grounds. Worth felt  almost as much interested in Greenwood as in the Grange. It had been  her mother's home for three years, and Elizabeth Ingelow had loved it  and talked much to her daughter of it.    Paul Ingelow did not move or speak, although he probably guessed who  his visitor was. Worth held out her hand. \"How do you do, Uncle Paul?\"  she said.    Paul ignored the outstretched hand. \"Who are you?\" he asked gruffly.    \"I am Worth Sheldon, your sister Elizabeth's daughter,\" she answered.  \"Won't you shake hands with me, Uncle Paul?\"    \"I have no sister Elizabeth,\" he answered unbendingly.    Worth folded her hands on the gatepost and met his frowning gaze  unshrinkingly. \"Oh, yes, you have,\" she said calmly. \"You can't do  away with natural ties by simply ignoring them, Uncle Paul. They go on  existing. I never knew until this morning that you were at enmity with  my mother. She never told me. But she has talked a great deal of you  to me. She has told me often how much you and she loved each other and  how good you always were to her. She sent her love to you.\"    \"Years ago I had a sister Elizabeth,\" said Paul Ingelow harshly. \"I  loved her very tenderly, but she married against my will a shiftless  scamp who--\"    Worth lifted her hand slightly. \"He was my father, Uncle Paul, and he  was always kind to me; whatever his faults may have been I cannot  listen to a word against him.\"    \"You shouldn't have come here, then,\" he said, but he said it less  harshly. There was even a certain reluctant approval of this composed,  independent niece in his eyes. \"Didn't they tell you at the Grange  that I didn't want to see you?\"    \"Yes, they told me this morning, but _I_ wanted to see you, so I came.  Why cannot we be friends, Uncle Paul, not because we are uncle and  niece, but simply because you are you and I am I? Let us leave my  father and mother out of the question and start fair on our own  account.\"    For a moment Uncle Paul looked at her. She met his gaze frankly and  firmly, with a merry smile lurking in her eyes. Then he threw back his  head and laughed a hearty laugh that was good to hear. \"Very well,\" he  said. \"It is a bargain.\"    He put his hand over the gate and shook hers. Then he opened the gate  and invited her into the house. Worth stayed to tea, and Uncle Paul  showed her all over Greenwood.    \"You are to come here as often as you like,\" he told her. \"When a  young lady and I make a compact of friendship I am going to live up to  it. But you are not to talk to me about your mother. Remember, we are  friends because I am I and you are you, and there is no question of  anybody else.\"    The Grange Ingelows were amazed to see Paul bringing Worth home in his  buggy that evening. When Worth had gone into the house Charlotte told  him that she was glad to see that he had relented towards Elizabeth's  child.    \"I have not,\" he made stern answer. \"I don't know whom you mean by  Elizabeth's child. That young woman and I have taken a liking for each  other which we mean to cultivate on our own account. Don't call her  Elizabeth's child to me again.\"    As the days and weeks went by Worth grew dearer and dearer to the  Grange folk. The aunts often wondered to themselves how they had  existed before Worth came and, oftener yet, how they could do without  her when the time came for her to go home. Meanwhile, the odd  friendship between her and Uncle Paul deepened and grew. They read and  drove and walked together. Worth spent half her time at Greenwood.  Once Uncle Paul said to her, as if speaking half to himself,    \"To think that James Sheldon could have a daughter like you!\"    Up went Worth's head. Worth's grey eyes flashed. \"I thought we were  not to speak of my parents?\" she said. \"You ought not to have been the  first to break the compact, Uncle Paul.\"    \"I accept the rebuke and beg your pardon,\" he said. He liked her all  the better for those little flashes of spirit across her girlish  composure.    One day in September they were together in the garden at Greenwood.  Worth, looking lovingly and regretfully down the sun-flecked avenue of  box, said with a sigh, \"Next month I must go home. How sorry I shall  be to leave the Grange and Greenwood. I have had such a delightful  summer, and I have learned to love all the old nooks and corners as  well as if I had lived here all my life.\"    \"Stay here!\" said Uncle Paul abruptly. \"Stay here with me. I want you,  Worth. Let Greenwood be your home henceforth and adopt your crusty old  bachelor uncle for a father.\"    \"Oh, Uncle Paul,\" cried Worth, \"I don't know--I don't think--oh, you  surprise me!\"    \"I surprise myself, perhaps. But I mean it, Worth. I am a rich, lonely  old man and I want to keep this new interest you have brought into my  life. Stay with me. I will try to give you a very happy life, my  child, and all I have shall be yours.\"    Seeing her troubled face, he added, \"There, I don't ask you to decide  right here. I suppose you have other claims to adjust. Take time to  think it over.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Worth. She went back to the Grange as one in a  dream and shut herself up in the white southeast room to think. She  knew that she wanted to accept this unexpected offer of Uncle Paul's.  Worth's loyal tongue had never betrayed, even to the loving aunts, any  discontent in the prairie farm life that had always been hers. But it  had been a hard life for the girl, narrow and poverty-bounded. She  longed to put forth her hand and take this other life which opened so  temptingly before her. She knew, too, that her mother, ambitious for  her child, would not be likely to interpose any objections. She had  only to go to Uncle Paul and all that she longed for would be given  her, together with the faithful, protecting fatherly love and care  that in all its strength and sweetness had never been hers.    She must decide for herself. Not even of Aunt Charlotte or Aunt Ellen  could she ask advice. She knew they would entreat her to accept, and  she needed no such incentive to her own wishes. Far on into the night  Worth sat at the white-curtained dormer window, looking at the stars  over the apple trees, and fighting her battle between inclination and  duty. It was a hard and stubbornly contested battle, but with that  square chin and those unfaltering grey eyes it could end in only one  way. Next day Worth went down to Greenwood.    \"Well, what is it to be?\" said Uncle Paul without preface, as he met  her in the garden.    \"I cannot come, Uncle Paul,\" said Worth steadily. \"I cannot give up my  mother.\"    \"I don't ask you to give her up,\" he said gruffly. \"You can write to  her and visit her. I don't want to come between parent and child.\"    \"That isn't the point exactly, Uncle Paul. I hope you will not be  angry with me for not accepting your offer. I wanted to--you don't  know how much I wanted to--but I cannot. Mother and I are so much to  each other, Uncle Paul, more, I am sure, than even most mothers and  daughters. You have never let me speak of her, but I must tell you  this. Mother has often told me that when I came to her things were  going very hard with her and that I was heaven's own gift to comfort  and encourage her. Then, in the ten years that followed, the three  other babies that came to her all died before they were two years old.  And with each loss Mother said I grew dearer to her. Don't you see,  Uncle Paul, I'm not merely just one child to her but I'm _all_ those  children? Six years ago the twins were born, and they are dear, bright  little lads, but they are very small yet, so Mother has really nobody  but me. I know she would consent to let me stay here, because she  would think it best for me, but it wouldn't be really best for me; it  couldn't be best for a girl to do what wasn't right. I love you, Uncle  Paul, and I love Greenwood, and I want to stay so much, but I cannot.  I have thought it all over and I must go back to Mother.\"    Uncle Paul did not say one word. He turned his back on Worth and  walked the full length of the box alley twice. Worth watched him  wistfully. Was he very angry? Would he forgive her?    \"You are an Ingelow, Worth,\" he said when he came back. That was all,  but Worth understood that her decision was not to cause any  estrangement between them.    A month later Worth's last day at the Grange came. She was to leave  for the West the next morning. They were all out in Grandfather  Ingelow's arcade, Uncle George and Aunt Charlotte and Aunt Ellen and  Worth, enjoying the ripe mellow sunshine of the October day, when Paul  Ingelow came up the slope. Worth went to meet him with outstretched  hands. He took them both in his and looked at her very gravely.    \"I have not come to say goodbye, Worth. I will not say it. You are  coming back to me.\"    Worth shook her brown head sadly. \"Oh, I cannot, Uncle Paul. You  know--I told you--\"    \"Yes, I know,\" he interrupted. \"I have been thinking it all over every  day since. You know yourself what the Ingelow determination is. It's a  good thing in a good cause but a bad thing in a bad one. And it is no  easy thing to conquer when you've let it rule you for years as I have  done. But I have conquered it, or you have conquered it for me. Child,  here is a letter. It is to your mother--my sister Elizabeth. In it I  have asked her to forgive me, and to forget our long estrangement. I  have asked her to come back"]]]
