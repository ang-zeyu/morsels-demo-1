While I      readily admit the very interesting devices of antiquity to possess      decided heraldic attributes, I cannot consider Mr. King to have      shown that, as a general rule, they were held by the ancients      themselves to have been either \"unalterable\" or \"hereditary.\"      Possibly, further light may be thrown upon the hereditary quality of      ancient Heraldry: but, I certainly do not expect to see any evidence      adduced, which would establish a line of descent connecting the      Mediæval Heraldry of England with any heraldic system of classic      antiquity.]      [Illustration: Nos. 7-10.--Ancient Shields from Greek Vases.]    This Heraldry of Antiquity is to be regarded as the predecessor, and not  as the ancestor of the Heraldry of England. There may be much that is  common to both; but, there is nothing to show the later system to have  been a lineal descendant from the earlier. It would seem much more  likely that Heraldry, when it had been evolved, adopted ready made the  emblems of an older civilisation for its own purpose, often  appropriating at the same time the symbolism attaching to the emblems.  The Heraldry, therefore, that has flourished, declined, and now is in  the act of reviving in our own country in almost the full vigour of its  best days, I shall treat as an independent science, proceeding from a  single source, and from thence flowing onwards with varied fortunes,  side by side with the chequered chronicles of England. In the course of  its progress from the palmy days of EDWARD III., it has had to  encounter, in a degree without precedent or parallel, that most painful  and mischievous of trials--the excessive admiration of injudicious  friends. Hence, Heraldry was brought into disrepute, and even into  contempt, by the very persons who loved it with a genuine but a most  unwise love. In process of time, no nonsense appeared too extravagant,  and no fable too wild, to be engrafted upon the grave dignity of the  Herald's early science. Better times at length have succeeded. Heraldry  now has friends and admirers, zealous as of old, whose zeal is guided  aright by a sound judgment in alliance with a pure taste. Very much  already has been accomplished to sweep away the amazing mass of  absurdities and errors which had overwhelmed our English Heraldry, by  such men as Nicholas, Nichols, Courthope, Seton, Planché, Walford,  Montagu, and Lower: and the good work goes on and prospers, with the  most cheering assurances of complete and triumphant success.          CHAPTER II    EARLY HERALDIC AUTHORITIES      _Seals: Monumental Effigies, &c.: Rolls of Arms, Official Heraldic    Records, &c.-- Earliest Heraldic Shields and Banners-- Allusive    Quality of Early Armory-- Attributed Arms._      \"Let us begin at the beginning.\"      --PURSUIVANT OF ARMS.      At the head of the earliest existing authorities in English Heraldry are  SEALS. To the fortunate circumstance of the legal importance attached to  them we are indebted for the preservation of these equally interesting  and valuable relics, in great variety and in very considerable numbers.  The heraldic evidence of Seals is necessarily of the highest order. They  are original works, possessing contemporaneous authority. Produced with  peculiar care and approved by their first possessors, their original  authenticity is confirmed by their continued use through successive  generations.    Having been in use before the introduction and adoption of Heraldry in  England, Seals enable us to compare the devices that preceded true  Heraldry with the earliest that are truly heraldic: and thus they show  that, in many instances, regular coats-of-arms were derived in their  hereditary bearings from similar devices that had been adopted in the  same families before the heraldic era. For example: the Seal of John  Mundegumri, about A.D. 1175, bears a _single fleur-de-lys_, not placed  upon a shield; and, accordingly, here is seen the origin of the _three  golden fleurs-de-lys_, borne afterwards upon a blue shield by the  descendants of this John, the Montgomeries, Earls of Eglintoun. Again:  the Seal of Walter Innes, A.D. 1431, displays the shield of arms of his  house--_three blue mullets_ (stars generally of five rays) on a field of  silver, No. 11; and these mullets may be traced to the _single star_,  that appears on the Seal of William Innes, or De Ynays, No. 12, appended  to his deed of homage to Edward I., in the year 1295. I have selected  these examples from the \"Catalogue of Scottish Seals,\" published by Mr.  Laing, of Edinburgh, that I may be enabled here to refer in the highest  terms of admiring commendation to that most excellent work. It is  greatly to be desired that a corresponding publication should treat,  with equal ability, of the Seals of England which, from the dawn of  Heraldry, continue their admirable examples and illustrations throughout  its career.      [Illustration: No. 11.--Seal of Walter Innes.]      [Illustration: No. 12.--Seal of Wm. Innes.]    Monumental Effigies, Sepulchral Memorials, early Buildings, and early  Stained Glass, frequently are rich in authoritative examples of \"the  figures of Heraldry.\" In addition to the various forms and combinations  of heraldic composition, these works illustrate the early style of  drawing in favour with Heralds during the great eras of mediæval Art,  and they have preserved to us most useful and suggestive representations  of various devices in their proper heraldic aspect. In many instances  the Heraldry of early Monuments and Architecture possesses a peculiar  value, arising from the circumstance of the shields of arms and other  insignia having been sculptured in low relief or outlined in incised  lines, and consequently these devices and compositions retain their  original forms: and, in like manner, the original colouring of the  Heraldry of Stained Glass remains safe from restoration or destruction,  in consequence of the impossibility of re-painting it.    The early written Literature of English Heraldry is calculated to throw  but little light upon either its true character or its history. In  addition, however, to the various and numerous official documents of the  Heralds' College, several examples of one particular class of heraldic  record have been preserved, the value of which cannot be too highly  estimated. These are ROLLS OF ARMS--long, narrow strips of parchment, on  which are written lists of the names and titles of certain personages,  with full descriptions of their armorial insignia. The circumstances  under which these Rolls were prepared are obviously not identical and  for the most part unknown: but, the exact accuracy of their statements  has been established beyond all question by careful and repeated  comparison with Seals and other Monuments, and also with Documents which  give only an indirect and yet not the less conclusive corroboration to  the records of the Rolls of Arms themselves. The earliest of these Rolls  at present known date about A.D. 1240 to 1245; and since in these  earliest Rolls a very decided technical language is uniformly adopted,  and the descriptions are all given in palpable accordance with fixed  rules which must then have been well understood, we infer that by the  end of the first half of the thirteenth century there was in existence a  system for the regulation of such matters. Heraldry was perhaps  recognised as a Science, with fixed terms and rules for describing  heraldic devices and figures, and established laws to direct the  granting, the assuming, and the bearing of arms.    The most interesting of these early heraldic Rolls records, in a  metrical form, and in Norman-French, the siege and capture of the  fortress of Carlaverock, on the Scottish border, by EDWARD I., in the  year 1300. In addition to very curious descriptions of the muster of the  Royal troops at Carlisle, their march northwards, and the incidents of  the siege (which last have a strange resemblance to what Homer has  recorded of incidents that took place during the siege of Troy), this  Roll gives some graphic personal sketches of the princes, nobles,  bannerets, and knights, whose banners and shields of arms are set forth  in it with minute exactness. This Roll, as well as several others, has  been published, with translations and very valuable notes.    In the Manuscript Collections of the British Museum also, and of other  Libraries both public and private, and in the County Histories, and  other works of a cognate character, there are many documents which  contain various important records and illustrations of early English  Heraldry.    In any references to authorities, that it may appear desirable for me to  make in the course of this and the following chapters, I must be as  concise as possible. A direct reference to Seals, Effigies, &c., will be  necessary in each case: but, in referring to Rolls of Arms, it will be  sufficient to denote the period of the authority in general terms.  Accordingly, I shall refer, not to each particular Roll, but  collectively to those of each of the following reigns--HENRY III.,  EDWARD I., EDWARD II., EDWARD III., and RICHARD II.; and these  references will severally be made thus,--(H. 3), (E. 1), (E. 2), (E. 3),  and (R. 2).    Amongst the earliest Shields and Banners of Arms, all of them remarkable  for their simplicity, many are found to be without any device whatever,  their distinction consisting simply in some peculiarity in the  colouring. Such examples may be considered to have been derived from  pre-heraldic times, and transmitted, without any change or addition, to  later periods.

I am very much occupied  in examining matters, and have to go out to look over the ground. Cousin  John tempts me strongly to go down, but I never visit for many reasons.  If for no other, to prevent compromising the house, for my visit would  certainly be known.    \"I have written to you fully and to Cousin Anna. I am decidedly of the  opinion that it would be better for you to leave, on your account and  Cousin Anna's. My only objection is the leaving of Cousin Anna alone,  if she will not go with you. If you prefer Richmond, go with Nannie.  Otherwise, go to the upper country, as John indicates. I fear I cannot  be with you anywhere. I do not think Richmond will be permanent.    \"Truly, R.\"    I may as well say here, that \"Cousin Anna\" never did leave \"Ravensworth\"  during the war. She remained there, with only a few faithful servants,  and managed to escape any serious molestation. \"Nannie\" was Mrs. S. S.  Lee, who shortly after this time went to Richmond.    On May 25th, my father was transferred, with all the Virginia troops, to  the Confederate States Army. He ceased to be a Major-General, and  became a Brigadier. No higher rank having been created as yet in the  Confederate service. Later, when the rank was created, he was made a  full general.    By the end of May, to quote from General Long,    \"Lee had organised, equipped, and sent to the field more than thirty  thousand men, and various regiments were in a forward state of  preparation.\"    When the Confederate government moved from Montgomery to Richmond, and  President Davis took charge of all military movements, my father was  kept near him as his constant and trusted adviser. His experience as  an engineer was of great service to the young Confederacy, and he was  called upon often for advice for the location of batteries and troops on  our different defensive lines. In a letter to my mother he speaks of one  of these trips to the waters east of Richmond.    \"Richmond, June 9, 1861.    \"...I have just returned from a visit to the batteries and troops on  James and York rivers, etc., where I was some days. I called a few hours  at the White House. Saw Charlotte and Annie. Fitzhugh was away, but got  out of the cars as I got in. Our little boy looked very sweet and seemed  glad to kiss me good-bye. Charlotte said she was going to prepare to  leave for the summer, but had not determined where to go. I could only  see some of the servants about the house and the stables. They were all  well.... You may be aware that the Confederate Government is established  here. Yesterday I turned over to it the command of the military and  naval forces of the State, in accordance with the proclamation of the  Government and the agreement between the State and the Confederate  States. I do not know what my position will be. I should like to retire  to private life, if I could be with you and the children, but if I can  be of any service to the State or her cause I must continue. Mr. Davis  and all his Cabinet are here.... Good-bye. Give much love to kind  friends. May God guard and bless you, them, and our suffering country,  and enable me to perform my duty. I think of you constantly. Write me  what you will do. Direct here.    \"Always yours,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    To my mother, who was now in Fauquier County, staying at \"Kinloch,\" Mr.  Edward Turner's home, he writes on June 24th, from Richmond:    \"...Your future arrangements are the source of much anxiety to me. No  one can say what is in the future, nor is it wise to anticipate evil.  But it is well to prepare for what may reasonably happen and be provided  for the worst. There is no saying when you can return to your home or  what may be its condition when you do return. What, then, can you do in  the meantime? To remain with friends may be incumbent, and where can you  go?... My movements are very uncertain, and I wish to take the field as  soon as certain arrangements can be made. I may go at any moment, and  to any point where it may be necessary.... Many of our old friends are  dropping in. E. P. Alexander is here, Jimmy Hill, Alston, Jenifer, etc.,  and I hear that my old colonel, A. S. Johnston, is crossing the plains  from California....    \"As ever, R. E. Lee.\"    I again quote from a letter to my mother, dated Richmond, July 12, 1861:    \"...I am very anxious to get into the field, but am detained by matters  beyond my control. I have never heard of the appointment, to which you  allude, of Commander-in-Chief of the Confederate States Army, nor have  I any expectation or wish for it. President Davis holds that position.  Since the transfer of the military operations in Virginia to the  authorities of the Confederate States, I have only occupied the position  of a general in that service, with the duties devolved on me by the  President. I have been labouring to prepare and get into the field the  Virginia troops, and to strengthen, by those from the other States, the  threatened commands of Johnston, Beauregard, Huger, Garnett, etc. Where  I shall go I do not know, as that will depend upon President Davis. As  usual in getting through with a thing, I have broken down a little and  had to take my bed last evening, but am at my office this morning and  hope will soon be right again.... My young friend Mr. Vest has just  returned from a search in the city for 'Dixie,' and says he has visited  every place in Richmond without finding it. I suppose it is exhausted.  Always yours,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    \"The booksellers say 'Dixie' is not to be had in Virginia. R. E. L.\"    On July 21st occurred the battle of Manassas. In a letter to my mother  written on the 27th, my father says:    \"...That indeed was a glorious victory and has lightened the pressure  upon our front amazingly. Do not grieve for the brave dead. Sorrow for  those they left behind--friends, relatives, and families. The former are  at rest. The latter must suffer. The battle will be repeated there in  greater force. I hope God will again smile on us and strengthen our  hearts and arms. I wished to partake in the former struggle, and am  mortified at my absence, but the President thought it more important I  should be here. I could not have done as well as has been done, but  I could have helped, and taken part in the struggle for my home and  neighbourhood. So the work is done I care not by whom it is done. I  leave to-morrow for the Northwest Army. I wished to go before, as I  wrote you, and was all prepared, but the indications were so evident of  the coming battle, and in the uncertainty of the result, the President  forbade my departure. Now it is necessary and he consents. I cannot say  for how long, but will write you.... I inclose you a letter from Markie  [Miss Martha Custis Williams--second cousin of my mother, afterward Mrs.  Admiral Carter, U.S.N.]. Write to her if you can and thank her for her  letter to me. I have not time. My whole time is occupied, and all my  thoughts and strength are given to the cause to which my life, be it  long or short, will be devoted. Tell her not to mind the reports she  sees in the papers. They are made to injure and occasion distrust. Those  that know me will not believe them. Those that do not will not care for  them. I laugh at them. Give love to all, and for yourself accept the  constant prayers and love of truly yours,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    It was thought best at this time to send General Lee to take command  of military operations in West Virginia. The ordinary difficulties of  a campaign in this country of mountains and bad roads were greatly  increased by incessant rains, sickness of all kinds amongst the new  troops, and the hostility of many of the inhabitants of the Southern  cause. My father's letters, which I will give here, tell of his trials  and troubles, and describe at the same time the beauty of the scenery  and some of the military movements.    About August 1st he started for his new command, and he writes to my  mother on his arrival at Huntersville, Pocahontas County, now West  Virginia:    \"Huntersville, August 4, 1861.    \"I reached here yesterday, dearest Mary, to visit this portion of the  army. The day after my arrival at Staunton, I set off for Monterey,  where the army of General Garnett's command is stationed. Two regiments  and a field-battery occupy the Alleghany Mountains in advance, about  thirty miles, and this division guards the road to Staunton. The  division here guards the road leading to the Warm Springs to Milboro and  Covington. Two regiments are advanced about twenty-eight miles to Middle  Mountain. Fitzhugh [Major W. H. F. Lee--General Lee's second son] with  his squadron is between that point and this. I have not seen him. I  understand he is well. South of here again is another column of our  enemies, making their way up the Kanawha Valley, and, from General  Wise's report, are not far from Lewisburgh. Their object seems to be to  get possession of the Virginia Central Railroad and the Virginia and  Tennessee Railroad. By the first they can approach Richmond; by the last  interrupt our reinforcements from the South. The points from which we  can be attacked are numerous, and their means are unlimited. So we must  always be on the alert. My uneasiness on these points brought me out  here. It is so difficult to get our people, unaccustomed to the  necessities of war, to comprehend and promptly execute the measures  required for the occasion. General Jackson of Georgia commands on the  Monterey line, General Loring on this line, and General Wise, supported  by General Floyd, on the Kanawha line. The soldiers everywhere are sick.  The measles are prevalent throughout the whole army, and you know that  disease leaves unpleasant results, attacks on the lungs, typhoid, etc.,  especially in camp, where"]]]
