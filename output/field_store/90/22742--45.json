Some years ago, I remember, there was a hearse  with two horses returning one dark night, and just by Farmer Sparrow's  house, where the pond is close to the road, the wheels went too near the  edge, and the hearse was overturned into the water; both the horses were  drowned, and the driver hardly escaped. Of course after this accident  a stout white rail was put up that might be easily seen, but if those  horses had not been partly blinded, they would of themselves have kept  further from the edge, and no accident would have happened. When our  master's carriage was overturned, before you came here, it was said that  if the lamp on the left side had not gone out, John would have seen the  great hole that the road-makers had left; and so he might, but if old  Colin had not had blinkers on he would have seen it, lamp or no lamp,  for he was far too knowing an old horse to run into danger. As it was,  he was very much hurt, the carriage was broken, and how John escaped  nobody knew.\"    \"I should say,\" said Ginger, curling her nostril, \"that these men, who  are so wise, had better give orders that in the future all foals should  be born with their eyes set just in the middle of their foreheads,  instead of on the side; they always think they can improve upon nature  and mend what God has made.\"    Things were getting rather sore again, when Merrylegs held up his  knowing little face and said, \"I'll tell you a secret: I believe John  does not approve of blinkers; I heard him talking with master about it  one day. The master said that 'if horses had been used to them, it might  be dangerous in some cases to leave them off'; and John said he thought  it would be a good thing if all colts were broken in without blinkers,  as was the case in some foreign countries. So let us cheer up, and have  a run to the other end of the orchard; I believe the wind has blown down  some apples, and we might just as well eat them as the slugs.\"    Merrylegs could not be resisted, so we broke off our long conversation,  and got up our spirits by munching some very sweet apples which lay  scattered on the grass.          11 Plain Speaking      The longer I lived at Birtwick the more proud and happy I felt at having  such a place. Our master and mistress were respected and beloved by all  who knew them; they were good and kind to everybody and everything; not  only men and women, but horses and donkeys, dogs and cats, cattle and  birds; there was no oppressed or ill-used creature that had not a friend  in them, and their servants took the same tone. If any of the village  children were known to treat any creature cruelly they soon heard about  it from the Hall.    The squire and Farmer Grey had worked together, as they said, for more  than twenty years to get check-reins on the cart-horses done away with,  and in our parts you seldom saw them; and sometimes, if mistress met  a heavily laden horse with his head strained up she would stop the  carriage and get out, and reason with the driver in her sweet serious  voice, and try to show him how foolish and cruel it was.    I don't think any man could withstand our mistress. I wish all ladies  were like her. Our master, too, used to come down very heavy sometimes.  I remember he was riding me toward home one morning when we saw a  powerful man driving toward us in a light pony chaise, with a beautiful  little bay pony, with slender legs and a high-bred sensitive head and  face. Just as he came to the park gates the little thing turned toward  them; the man, without word or warning, wrenched the creature's head  round with such a force and suddenness that he nearly threw it on its  haunches. Recovering itself it was going on, when he began to lash it  furiously. The pony plunged forward, but the strong, heavy hand held the  pretty creature back with force almost enough to break its jaw, while  the whip still cut into him. It was a dreadful sight to me, for I knew  what fearful pain it gave that delicate little mouth; but master gave me  the word, and we were up with him in a second.    \"Sawyer,\" he cried in a stern voice, \"is that pony made of flesh and  blood?\"    \"Flesh and blood and temper,\" he said; \"he's too fond of his own will,  and that won't suit me.\" He spoke as if he was in a strong passion. He  was a builder who had often been to the park on business.    \"And do you think,\" said master sternly, \"that treatment like this will  make him fond of your will?\"    \"He had no business to make that turn; his road was straight on!\" said  the man roughly.    \"You have often driven that pony up to my place,\" said master; \"it only  shows the creature's memory and intelligence; how did he know that you  were not going there again? But that has little to do with it. I must  say, Mr. Sawyer, that a more unmanly, brutal treatment of a little  pony it was never my painful lot to witness, and by giving way to such  passion you injure your own character as much, nay more, than you injure  your horse; and remember, we shall all have to be judged according to  our works, whether they be toward man or toward beast.\"    Master rode me home slowly, and I could tell by his voice how the thing  had grieved him. He was just as free to speak to gentlemen of his own  rank as to those below him; for another day, when we were out, we met  a Captain Langley, a friend of our master's; he was driving a splendid  pair of grays in a kind of break. After a little conversation the  captain said:    \"What do you think of my new team, Mr. Douglas? You know, you are the  judge of horses in these parts, and I should like your opinion.\"    The master backed me a little, so as to get a good view of them. \"They  are an uncommonly handsome pair,\" he said, \"and if they are as good as  they look I am sure you need not wish for anything better; but I see  you still hold that pet scheme of yours for worrying your horses and  lessening their power.\"    \"What do you mean,\" said the other, \"the check-reins? Oh, ah! I know  that's a hobby of yours; well, the fact is, I like to see my horses hold  their heads up.\"    \"So do I,\" said master, \"as well as any man, but I don't like to  see them held up; that takes all the shine out of it. Now, you are a  military man, Langley, and no doubt like to see your regiment look well  on parade, 'heads up', and all that; but you would not take much credit  for your drill if all your men had their heads tied to a backboard! It  might not be much harm on parade, except to worry and fatigue them; but  how would it be in a bayonet charge against the enemy, when they want  the free use of every muscle, and all their strength thrown forward? I  would not give much for their chance of victory. And it is just the same  with horses: you fret and worry their tempers, and decrease their power;  you will not let them throw their weight against their work, and so  they have to do too much with their joints and muscles, and of course  it wears them up faster. You may depend upon it, horses were intended  to have their heads free, as free as men's are; and if we could act a  little more according to common sense, and a good deal less according  to fashion, we should find many things work easier; besides, you know as  well as I that if a horse makes a false step, he has much less chance  of recovering himself if his head and neck are fastened back. And now,\"  said the master, laughing, \"I have given my hobby a good trot out, can't  you make up your mind to mount him, too, captain? Your example would go  a long way.\"    \"I believe you are right in theory,\" said the other, \"and that's rather  a hard hit about the soldiers; but--well--I'll think about it,\" and so  they parted.          12 A Stormy Day      One day late in the autumn my master had a long journey to go on  business. I was put into the dog-cart, and John went with his master. I  always liked to go in the dog-cart, it was so light and the high wheels  ran along so pleasantly. There had been a great deal of rain, and now  the wind was very high and blew the dry leaves across the road in a  shower. We went along merrily till we came to the toll-bar and the low  wooden bridge. The river banks were rather high, and the bridge, instead  of rising, went across just level, so that in the middle, if the river  was full, the water would be nearly up to the woodwork and planks; but  as there were good substantial rails on each side, people did not mind  it.    The man at the gate said the river was rising fast, and he feared it  would be a bad night. Many of the meadows were under water, and in one  low part of the road the water was halfway up to my knees; the bottom  was good, and master drove gently, so it was no matter.    When we got to the town of course I had a good bait, but as the master's  business engaged him a long time we did not start for home till rather  late in the afternoon. The wind was then much higher, and I heard the  master say to John that he had never been out in such a storm; and so I  thought, as we went along the skirts of a wood, where the great branches  were swaying about like twigs, and the rushing sound was terrible.    \"I wish we were well out of this wood,\" said my master.    \"Yes, sir,\" said John, \"it would be rather awkward if one of these  branches came down upon us.\"    The words were scarcely out of his mouth when there was a groan, and a  crack, and a splitting sound, and tearing, crashing down among the other  trees came an oak, torn up by the roots, and it fell right across the  road just before us. I will never say I was not frightened, for I was. I  stopped still, and I believe I trembled; of course I did not turn round  or run away; I was not brought up to that. John jumped out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710"],[0,"Louise de la Valliere (#7)"],[1," not: and, consequently, I told the valet who waited on me to bring me my  clothes.\"    \"You were quite naked, then?\"    \"Oh, no! on the contrary, I had a magnificent dressing-gown to wear. The  lackey obeyed; I dressed myself in my own clothes, which had become  too large for me; but a strange circumstance had happened,--my feet had  become too large.\"    \"Yes, I quite understand.\"    \"And my boots too small.\"    \"You mean your feet were still swollen?\"    \"Exactly; you have hit it.\"    \"_Pardieu!_ And is that the accident you were going to tell me about?\"    \"Oh, yes; I did not make the same reflection you have done. I said to  myself: 'Since my feet have entered my boots ten times, there is no  reason why they should not go in the eleventh.'\"    \"Allow me to tell you, my dear Porthos, that on this occasion you failed  in your logic.\"    \"In short, then, they placed me opposite to a part of the room which  was partitioned; I tried to get my boot on; I pulled it with my hands,  I pushed with all the strength of the muscles of my leg, making the most  unheard-of efforts, when suddenly the two tags of my boot remained in my  hands, and my foot struck out like a ballista.\"    \"How learned you are in fortification, dear Porthos.\"    \"My foot darted out like a ballista, and came against the partition,  which it broke in; I really thought that, like Samson, I had demolished  the temple. And the number of pictures, the quantity of china, vases  of flowers, carpets, and window-panes that fell down were really  wonderful.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"Without reckoning that on the other side of the partition was a small  table laden with porcelain--\"    \"Which you knocked over?\"    \"Which I dashed to the other side of the room,\" said Porthos, laughing.    \"Upon my word, it is, as you say, astonishing,\" replied D'Artagnan,  beginning to laugh also; whereupon Porthos laughed louder than ever.    \"I broke,\" said Porthos, in a voice half-choked from his increasing  mirth, \"more than three thousand francs worth of china--ha, ha, ha!\"    \"Good!\" said D'Artagnan.    \"I smashed more than four thousand francs worth of glass!--ho, ho, ho!\"    \"Excellent.\"    \"Without counting a luster, which fell on my head and was broken into a  thousand pieces--ha, ha, ha!\"    \"Upon your head?\" said D'Artagnan, holding his sides.    \"On top.\"    \"But your head was broken, I suppose?\"    \"No, since I tell you, on the contrary, my dear fellow, that it was the  luster which was broken, like glass, which, in point of fact, it was.\"    \"Ah! the luster was glass, you say.\"    \"Venetian glass! a perfect curiosity, quite matchless, indeed, and  weighed two hundred pounds.\"    \"And it fell upon your head!\"    \"Upon my head. Just imagine, a globe of crystal, gilded all over, the  lower part beautifully encrusted, perfumes burning at the top, with jets  from which flame issued when they were lighted.\"    \"I quite understand, but they were not lighted at the time, I suppose?\"    \"Happily not, or I should have been grilled prematurely.\"    \"And you were only knocked down flat, instead?\"    \"Not at all.\"    \"How, 'not at all?'\"    \"Why, the luster fell on my skull. It appears that we have upon the top  of our heads an exceedingly thick crust.\"    \"Who told you that, Porthos?\"    \"The doctor. A sort of dome which would bear Notre-Dame.\"    \"Bah!\"    \"Yes, it seems that our skulls are made in that manner.\"    \"Speak for yourself, my dear fellow, it is your own skull that is made  in that manner, and not the skulls of other people.\"    \"Well, that may be so,\" said Porthos, conceitedly, \"so much, however,  was that the case, in my instance, that no sooner did the luster fall  upon the dome which we have at the top of our head, than there was a  report like a cannon, the crystal was broken to pieces, and I fell,  covered from head to foot.\"    \"With blood, poor Porthos!\"    \"Not at all; with perfumes, which smelt like rich creams; it was  delicious, but the odor was too strong, and I felt quite giddy from it;  perhaps you have experienced it sometimes yourself, D'Artagnan?\"    \"Yes, in inhaling the scent of the lily of the valley; so that, my  poor friend, you were knocked over by the shock and overpowered by the  perfumes?\"    \"Yes; but what is very remarkable, for the doctor told me he had never  seen anything like it--\"    \"You had a bump on your head I suppose?\" interrupted D'Artagnan.    \"I had five.\"    \"Why five?\"    \"I will tell you; the luster had, at its lower extremity, five gilt  ornaments; excessively sharp.\"    \"Oh!\"    \"Well, these five ornaments penetrated my hair, which, as you see, I  wear very thick.\"    \"Fortunately so.\"    \"And they made a mark on my skin. But just notice the singularity of  it, these things seem really only to happen to me! Instead of making  indentations, they made bumps. The doctor could never succeed in  explaining that to me satisfactorily.\"    \"Well, then, I will explain it to you.\"    \"You will do me a great service if you will,\" said Porthos, winking his  eyes, which, with him, was sign of the profoundest attention.    \"Since you have been employing your brain in studies of an exalted  character, in important calculations, and so on, the head has gained a  certain advantage, so that your head is now too full of science.\"    \"Do you think so?\"    \"I am sure of it. The result is, that, instead of allowing any foreign  matter to penetrate the interior of the head, your bony box or skull,  which is already too full, avails itself of the openings which are made  in allowing this excess to escape.\"    \"Ah!\" said Porthos, to whom this explanation appeared clearer than that  of the doctor.    \"The five protuberances, caused by the five ornaments of the luster,  must certainly have been scientific globules, brought to the surface by  the force of circumstances.\"    \"In fact,\" said Porthos, \"the real truth is, that I felt far worse  outside my head than inside. I will even confess, that when I put my hat  upon my head, clapping it on my head with that graceful energy which we  gentlemen of the sword possess, if my fist was not very gently applied,  I experienced the most painful sensations.\"    \"I quite believe you, Porthos.\"    \"Therefore, my friend,\" said the giant, \"M. Fouquet decided, seeing how  slightly built the house was, to give me another lodging, and so they  brought me here.\"    \"It is the private park, I think, is it not?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Where the rendezvous are made; that park, indeed, which is  so celebrated in some of those mysterious stories about the  superintendent?\"    \"I don't know; I have had no rendezvous or heard mysterious stories  myself, but they have authorized me to exercise my muscles, and I take  advantage of the permission by rooting up some of the trees.\"    \"What for?\"    \"To keep my hand in, and also to take some birds' nests; I find it more  convenient than climbing.\"    \"You are as pastoral as Tyrcis, my dear Porthos.\"    \"Yes, I like the small eggs; I like them very much better than larger  ones. You have no idea how delicate an _omelette_ is, if made of four  or five hundred eggs of linnets, chaffinches, starlings, blackbirds, and  thrushes.\"    \"But five hundred eggs is perfectly monstrous!\"    \"A salad-bowl will hold them easily enough,\" said Porthos.    D'Artagnan looked at Porthos admiringly for full five minutes, as if  he had seen him for the first time, while Porthos spread his chest  out joyously and proudly. They remained in this state several minutes,  Porthos smiling, and D'Artagnan looking at him. D'Artagnan was evidently  trying to give the conversation a new turn. \"Do you amuse yourself much  here, Porthos?\" he asked at last, very likely after he had found out  what he was searching for.    \"Not always.\"    \"I can imagine that; but when you get thoroughly bored, by and by, what  do you intend to do?\"    \"Oh! I shall not be here for any length of time. Aramis is waiting until  the last bump on my head disappears, in order to present me to the king,  who I am told cannot endure the sight of a bump.\"    \"Aramis is still in Paris, then?\"    \"No.\"    \"Whereabouts is he, then?\"    \"At Fontainebleau.\"    \"Alone?\"    \"With M. Fouquet.\"    \"Very good. But do you happen to know one thing?\"    \"No, tell it me, and then I shall know.\"    \"Well, then, I think Aramis is forgetting you.\"    \"Do you really think so?\"    \"Yes; for at Fontainebleau yonder, you must know, they are laughing,  dancing, banqueting, and drawing the corks of M. de Mazarin's wine in  fine style. Are you aware that they have a ballet every evening there?\"    \"The deuce they have!\"    \"I assure you that your dear Aramis is forgetting you.\"    \"Well, that is not at all unlikely, and I have myself thought so  sometimes.\"    \"Unless he is playing you a trick, the sly fellow!\"    \"Oh!\"    \"You know that Aramis is as sly as a fox.\"    \"Yes, but to play _me_ a trick--\"    \"Listen: in the first place, he puts you under a sort of sequestration.\"    \"He sequestrates me! Do you mean to say I am sequestrated?\"    \"I think so.\"    \"I wish you would have the goodness to prove that to me.\"    \"Nothing easier. Do you ever go out?\"    \"Never.\"    \"Do you ever ride on horseback?\"    \"Never.\"    \"Are your friends allowed to come and see you?\"    \"Never.\"    \"Very well, then; never to go out, never to ride on horseback, never to  be allowed to see your friends, that is called being sequestrated.\"    \"But why should Aramis sequestrate me?\" inquired Porthos.    \"Come,\" said D'Artagnan, \"be frank, Porthos.\"    \"As gold.\"    \"It was Aramis who drew the plan of the fortifications at Belle-Isle,  was it not?\"    Porthos colored as he said, \"Yes; but that was all he did.\"    \"Exactly, and my own opinion is that it was no very great affair after  all.\"    \"That is mine, too.\"    \"Very good; I am delighted we are of the same opinion.\"    \"He never even came to Belle-Isle,\" said Porthos.    \"There now, you see.\"    \"It was I who went to Vannes, as you may"]]]
