Ordinarily, the victims were buried immediately after death, with such  imperfect rites of sepulture as the harassed frightened priests would  pay them, and very seldom was time afforded by the authorities to the  survivors to pay those last offices to the departed which a Spaniard  and a Catholic considers so important. Once I was present at a  terrible scene in the house of a New Granada grandee, whose pride and  poverty justified many of the old Spanish proverbs levelled at his  caste.    It was when the cholera was at its height, and yet he had  left--perhaps on important business--his wife and family, and gone to  Panama for three days. On the day after his departure, the plague  broke out in his house, and my services were required promptly. I  found the miserable household in terrible alarm, and yet confining  their exertions to praying to a coarse black priest in a black  surplice, who, kneeling beside the couch of the Spanish lady, was  praying (in his turn) to some favourite saint in Cruces. The sufferer  was a beautiful woman, suffering from a violent attack of cholera,  with no one to help her, or even to take from her arms the poor little  child they had allowed her to retain. In her intervals of comparative  freedom from pain, her cries to the Madonna and her husband were  heartrending to hear. I had the greatest difficulty to rout the stupid  priest and his as stupid worshippers, and do what I could for the  sufferer. It was very little, and before long the unconscious Spaniard  was a widower. Soon after, the authorities came for the body. I never  saw such passionate anger and despair as were shown by her relatives  and servants, old and young, at the intrusion--rage that she, who had  been so exalted in life, should go to her grave like the poor, poor  clay she was. Orders were given to bar the door against the convict  gang who had come to discharge their unpleasant duty, and while all  were busy decking out the unconscious corpse in gayest attire, none  paid any heed to me bending over the fire with the motherless child,  journeying fast to join its dead parent. I had made more than one  effort to escape, for I felt more sick and wretched than at any  similar scene of woe; but finding exit impossible, I turned my back  upon them, and attended to the dying child. Nor did I heed their  actions until I heard orders given to admit the burial party, and then  I found that they had dressed the corpse in rich white satin, and  decked her head with flowers.    The agitation and excitement of this scene had affected me as no  previous horror had done, and I could not help fancying that symptoms  were showing themselves in me with which I was familiar enough in  others. Leaving the dying infant to the care of its relatives (when  the Spaniard returned he found himself widowed and childless), I  hastened to my brother's house. When there, I felt an unpleasant chill  come over me, and went to bed at once. Other symptoms followed  quickly, and, before nightfall, I knew full well that my turn had come  at last, and that the cholera had attacked me, perhaps its greatest  foe in Cruces.

When it became known that their \"yellow doctress\" had the cholera, I  must do the people of Cruces the justice to say that they gave her  plenty of sympathy, and would have shown their regard for her more  actively, had there been any occasion. Indeed, when I most wanted  quiet, it was difficult to keep out the sympathising Americans and  sorrowing natives who came to inquire after me; and who, not content  with making their inquiries, and leaving their offerings of blankets,  flannel, etc., must see with their own eyes what chance the yellow  woman had of recovery. The rickety door of my little room could never  be kept shut for many minutes together. A visitor would open it  silently, poke his long face in with an expression of sympathy that  almost made me laugh in spite of my pain, draw it out again, between  the narrowest possible opening, as if he were anxious to admit as  little air as he could; while another would come in bodily, and after  looking at me curiously and inquisitively, as he would eye a horse or  nigger he had some thoughts of making a bid for, would help to carpet  my room, with the result perhaps of his meditations, and saying,  gravely, \"Air you better, Aunty Seacole, now? Isn't there a something  we can du for you, ma'am?\" would as gravely give place to another and  another yet, until I was almost inclined to throw something at them,  or call them bad names, like the Scotch king does the ghosts in the  play.[A] But, fortunately, the attack was a very mild one, and by the  next day all danger had gone by, although I still felt weak and  exhausted.    After a few weeks, the first force of the cholera was spent, and  although it lingered with us, as though loath to leave so fine a  resting-place, for some months, it no longer gave us much alarm; and  before long, life went on as briskly and selfishly as ever with the  Cruces survivors, and the terrible past was conveniently forgotten.  Perhaps it is so everywhere; but the haste with which the Cruces  people buried their memory seemed indecent. Old houses found new  masters; the mules new drivers; the great Spaniard chose another  pretty woman, and had a grand, poor, dirty wedding, and was married by  the same lazy black priest who had buried his wife, dead a few months  back; and very likely they would all have hastened as quickly to  forget their doctress, had circumstances permitted them: but every now  and then one of them sickened and died of the old complaint; and the  reputation I had established founded for me a considerable practice.  The Americans in the place gladly retained me as their medical  attendant, and in one way or other gave me plenty to do; but, in  addition to this, I determined to follow my original scheme of keeping  an hotel in Cruces.    Right opposite my brother's Independent Hotel there was a place to let  which it was considered I could adapt to my purpose. It was a mere  tumble-down hut, with wattled sides, and a rotten thatched roof,  containing two rooms, one small enough to serve as a bedroom. For this  charming residence--very openly situated, and well ventilated--twenty  pounds a month was considered a fair and by no means exorbitant rent.  And yet I was glad to take possession of it; and in a few days had  hung its rude walls with calico of gayest colour in stripes, with an  exuberance of fringes, frills, and bows (the Americans love show  dearly), and prepared it to accommodate fifty dinner guests. I had  determined that it should be simply a _table d'hote_, and that I would  receive no lodgers. Once, and once only, I relaxed this rule in favour  of two American women, who sent me to sleep by a lengthy quarrel of  words, woke me in the night to witness its crisis in a fisticuff  _duello_, and left in the morning, after having taken a fancy to some  of my moveables which were most easily removeable. I had on my staff  my black servant Mac, the little girl I have before alluded to, and a  native cook. I had had many opportunities of seeing how my brother  conducted his business; and adopted his tariff of charges. For an  ordinary dinner my charge was four shillings; eggs and chickens were,  as I have before said, distinct luxuries, and fetched high prices.    Four crowds generally passed through Cruces every month. In these were  to be found passengers to and from Chili, Peru, and Lima, as well as  California and America. The distance from Cruces to Panama was not  great--only twenty miles, in fact; but the journey, from the want of  roads and the roughness of the country, was a most fatiguing one. In  some parts--as I found when I made the journey, in company with my  brother--it was almost impassable; and for more than half the  distance, three miles an hour was considered splendid progress. The  great majority of the travellers were rough, rude men, of dirty,  quarrelsome habits; the others were more civilized and more dangerous.  And it was not long before I grew very tired of life in Cruces,  although I made money rapidly, and pressed my brother to return to  Kingston. Poor fellow! it would have been well for him had he done so;  for he stayed only to find a grave on the Isthmus of Panama.    The company at my _table d'hote_ was not over select; and it was often  very difficult for an unprotected female to manage them, although I  always did my best to put them in good humour. Among other comforts, I  used to hire a black barber, for the rather large consideration of two  pounds, to shave my male guests. You can scarcely conceive the  pleasure and comfort an American feels in a clean chin; and I believe  my barber attracted considerable custom to the British Hotel at  Cruces. I had a little out-house erected for his especial convenience;  and there, well provided with towels, and armed with plenty of razors,  a brush of extraordinary size, and a foaming sea of lather, Jose  shaved the new-comers. The rivalry to get within reach of his huge  brush was very great; and the threats used by the neglected, when the  grinning black was considered guilty of any interested partiality,  were of the fiercest description.    This duty over, they and their coarser female companions--many of them  well known to us, for they travelled backwards and forwards across the  Isthmus, hanging on to the foolish gold-finders--attacked the dinner,  very often with great lack of decency. It was no use giving them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23033"],[0,"Classic French Course in English (#7)"],[1,"yet would be  truth, and nothing but the truth\"? If any thing besides fondness for  paradox inspired Coleridge in saying this, it must, one would guess,  have been belief on his part in the allegorical sense hidden deep  underneath the monstrous mass of the Rabelaisian buffoonery. A more  judicial sentence is that of Hallam, the historian of the literature of  Europe: \"He [Rabelais] is never serious in a single page, and seems to  have had little other aim, in his first two volumes, than to pour out  the exuberance of his animal gayety.\"    The supply of animal gayety in this man was something portentous. One  cannot, however, but feel that he forces it sometimes, as sometimes did  Dickens those exhaustless animal spirits of his. A very common trick of  the Rabelaisian humor is to multiply specifications, or alternative  expressions, one after another, almost without end. From the second book  of his romance,--an afterthought, probably, of continuation to his  unexpectedly successful first book,--we take the last paragraph of the  prologue, which shows this. The veracious historian makes obtestation of  the strict truth of his narrative, and imprecates all sorts of evil upon  such as do not believe it absolutely. We cleanse our extract a little:--         And, therefore, to make an end of this Prologue, even as I give       myself to an hundred thousand panniers-full of fair devils, body       and soul,... in case that I lie so much as one single word in this       whole history; after the like manner, St. Anthony's fire burn you,       Mahoom's disease whirl you, the squinance with a stitch in your       side, and the wolf in your stomach truss you, the bloody flux seize       upon you, the cursed sharp inflammations of wild fire, as slender       and thin as cow's hair strengthened with quicksilver, enter into       you,... and, like those of Sodom and Gomorrha, may you fall into       sulphur, fire, and bottomless pits, in case you do not firmly       believe all that I shall relate unto you in this present Chronicle.    So much for Rabelais's prologues. Our readers must now see something of  what, under pains and penalties denounced so dire, they are bound to  believe. We condense and defecate for this purpose the thirty-eighth  chapter of the first book, which is staggeringly entitled, \"How  Gargantua did eat up Six Pilgrims in a Sallad\":--         The story requireth that we relate that which happened unto six       pilgrims, who came from Sebastian near to Nantes; and who, for       shelter that night, being afraid of the enemy, had hid themselves       in the garden upon the chickling peas, among the cabbages and       lettuces. Gargantua, finding himself somewhat dry, asked whether       they could get any lettuce to make him a salad; and, hearing that       there were the greatest and fairest in the country,--for they were       as great as plum trees, or as walnut trees,--he would go thither       himself, and brought thence in his hand what he thought good, and       withal carried away the six pilgrims, who were in so great fear       that they did not dare to speak nor cough. Washing them, therefore,       first at the fountain, the pilgrims said one to another, softly,       \"What shall we do? We are almost drowned here amongst these       lettuce: shall we speak? But, if we speak, he will kill us for       spies.\" And, as they were thus deliberating what to do, Gargantua       put them, with the lettuce, into a platter of the house, as large       as the huge tun of the White Friars of the Cistertian order; which       done, with oil, vinegar, and salt, he ate them up, to refresh       himself a little before supper, and had already swallowed up five       of the pilgrims, the sixth being in the platter, totally hid under       a lettuce, except his bourbon, or staff, that appeared, and nothing       else. Which Grangousier [Gargantua's father] seeing, said to       Gargantua, \"I think that is the horn of a shell snail: do not eat       it.\"--\"Why not?\" said Gargantua; \"they are good all this month:\"       which he no sooner said, but, drawing up the staff, and therewith       taking up the pilgrim, he ate him very well, then drank a terrible       draught of excellent white wine. The pilgrims, thus devoured, made       shift to save themselves, as well as they could, by drawing their       bodies out of the reach of the grinders of his teeth, but could       not escape from thinking they had been put in the lowest dungeon of       a prison. And, when Gargantua whiffed the great draught, they       thought to have drowned in his mouth, and the flood of wine had       almost carried them away into the gulf of his stomach.       Nevertheless, skipping with their bourbons, as St. Michael's       palmers used to do, they sheltered themselves from the danger of       that inundation under the banks of his teeth. But one of them, by       chance, groping, or sounding the country with his staff, to try       whether they were in safety or no, struck hard against the cleft of       a hollow tooth, and hit the mandibulary sinew or nerve of the jaw,       which put Gargantua to very great pain, so that he began to cry for       the rage that he felt. To ease himself, therefore, of his smarting       ache, he called for his tooth-picker, and, rubbing towards a young       walnut-tree, where they lay skulking, unnestled you my gentlemen       pilgrims. For he caught one by the legs, another by the scrip,       another by the pocket, another by the scarf, another by the band of       the breeches; and the poor fellow that had hurt him with the       bourbon, him he hooked to him by [another part of his clothes]....       The pilgrims, thus dislodged, ran away.    Rabelais closes his story with jocose irreverent application of  Scripture,--a manner of his which gives some color to the tradition of a  biblical pun made by him on his death-bed.    The closest English analogue to Rabelais is undoubtedly Dean Swift. We  probably never should have had \"Gulliver's Travels\" from Swift, if we  had not first had Gargantua and Pantagruel from Rabelais. Swift,  however, differs from Rabelais as well as resembles him. Whereas  Rabelais is simply monstrous in invention, Swift in invention submits  himself loyally to law. Give Swift his world of Liliput and Brobdingnag  respectively, and all, after that, is quite natural and probable. The  reduction or the exaggeration is made upon a mathematically calculated  scale. For such verisimilitude Rabelais cares not a straw. His various  inventions are recklessly independent one of another. A characteristic  of Swift thus is scrupulous conformity to whimsical law. Rabelais is  remarkable for whimsical disregard of even his own whimseys. Voltaire  put the matter with his usual felicity,--Swift is Rabelais in his  senses.    One of the most celebrated--justly celebrated--of Rabelais's  imaginations is that of the Abbey of Theleme [Thelema]. This constitutes  a kind of Rabelaisian Utopia. It was proper of the released monk to give  his Utopian dream the form of an abbey, but an abbey in which the  opposite should obtain of all that he had so heartily hated in his own  monastic experience. A humorously impossible place and state was the  Abbey of Theleme,--a kind of sportive Brook Farm set far away in a world  unrealized. How those Thelemites enjoyed life, to be sure! It was like  endless plum pudding--for everybody to eat, and nobody to prepare:--         All their life was spent not in laws, statutes, or rules, but       according to their own free will and pleasure. They rose out of       their beds when they thought good; they did eat, drink, labor,       sleep, when they had a mind to it, and were disposed for it. None       did awake them, none did offer to constrain them to eat, drink, nor       to do any other thing; for so had Gargantua established it. In all       their rule, and strictest tie of their order, there was but this       one clause to be observed,--           DO WHAT THOU WILT.           ...By this liberty they entered into a very laudable emulation, to       do all of them what they saw did please one. If any of the gallants       or ladies should say, Let us drink, they would all drink. If any       one of them said, Let us play, they all played. If one said, Let us       go a walking into the fields, they went all.... There was neither       he nor she amongst them, but could read, write, sing, play upon       several musical instruments, speak five or six several languages,       and compose in them all very quaintly, both in verse and prose.       Never were seen so valiant knights, so noble and worthy, so       dextrous and skilful both on foot and a horseback, more brisk and       lively, more nimble and quick, or better handling all manner of       weapons than were there. Never were seen ladies so proper and       handsome, so miniard and dainty, less forward, or more ready with       their hand, and with their needle, in every honest and free action       belonging to that sex, than were there. For this reason, when the       time came, that any man of the said abbey, either at the request of       his parents, or for some other cause, had a mind to go out of it,       he carried along with him one of the ladies, namely her who had       before that accepted him as her lover, and they were married       together.    The foregoing is one of the most purely sweet imaginative passages in  Rabelais's works. The representation, as a whole, sheathes, of course, a  keen satire on the religious houses. Real religion, Rabelais nowhere  attacks.    The same colossal Gargantua who had that eating adventure with the six  pilgrims, is made, in Rabelais's second book, to write his youthful son  Pantagruel--also a giant, but destined to be, when mature, a model of  all princely virtues--a letter on education, in which the most pious  paternal exhortation occurs."]]]
