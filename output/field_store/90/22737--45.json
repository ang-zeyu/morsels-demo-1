Before sizing it will be necessary to go through a book and take out  any pencil or dust marks that can be removed with indiarubber or bread  crumbs, or the size will fix them, and it will be found exceedingly  difficult to remove them afterwards.    When the sheets are dry they should be carefully mended in any places  that may be torn, and folded up into sections and pressed. A long,  comparatively light pressure will be found to flatten them better and  with less injury to the surface of the paper than a short, very heavy  pressure, such as that of the rolling-machine.    In some cases it will be found that sheets of old books are so far  damaged as to be hardly strong enough to handle. Such sheets must be  sized in rather a stronger size in the following way:--Take a sheet of  heavily-sized paper, such as notepaper, and carefully lay your damaged  sheet on that. Then put another sheet of strong paper on the top, and  put all three sheets into the size. It will be found that the top  sheet can then be easily lifted off, and the size be made to flow over  the face of the damaged sheet. Then, if the top sheet be put on again,  the three sheets, if handled as one, can be turned over and the  operation repeated, and size induced to cover the back of the damaged  leaf. The three sheets must then be taken out and laid between  blotting-paper to take up the surplus moisture. The top sheet must  then be carefully peeled off, and the damaged page laid face downwards  on clean blotting-paper. Then the back sheet can be peeled off as  well, leaving the damaged sheet to dry.    The following is quoted from \"Chambers' Encyclopaedia\" on Gelatine:--    \"Gelatine should never be judged by the eye alone.    \"Its purity may be very easily tested thus: Soak it in cold water,  then pour upon it a small quantity of boiling water. If pure, it will  form a thickish, clear straw-coloured solution, free from smell; but  if made of impure materials, it will give off a very offensive odour,  and have a yellow, gluey consistency.\"                                      WASHING    When there are stains or ink marks on books that cannot be removed by  the use of hot size or hot water, stronger measures may sometimes have  to be taken. Many stains will be found to yield readily to hot water  with a little alum in it, and others can be got out by a judicious  application of curd soap with a very soft brush and plenty of warm  water. But some, and especially ink stains, require further treatment.  There are many ways of washing paper, and most of those in common use  are extremely dangerous, and have in many cases resulted in the  absolute destruction of fine books. If it is thought to be absolutely  necessary that the sheets of a book should be washed, the safest  method is as follows:--Take an ounce of permanganate of potash  dissolved in a quart of water, and warmed slightly. In this put the  sheets to be washed, and leave them until they turn a dark brown. This  will usually take about an hour, but may take longer for some papers.  Then turn the sheets out and wash them in running water until all  trace of purple stain disappears from the water as it comes away. Then  transfer them to a bath of sulphurous (not sulphuric) acid and water  in the proportion of one ounce of acid to one pint of water. The  sheets in this solution will rapidly turn white, and if left for some  time nearly all stains will be removed. In case any stains refuse to  come out, the sheets should be put in clear water for a short time,  and then placed in the permanganate of potash solution again, and left  there for a longer time than before; then after washing in clear  water, again transferred to the sulphurous acid. When sheets are  removed from the sulphurous acid they should be well washed for an  hour or two in running water, and then may be blotted or squeezed off  and hung up on lines to dry. Any sheets treated in this way will  require sizing afterwards. And if, as is often the case, only a few  sheets at the beginning or end of the book have to be washed, it will  be necessary to tone down the washed sheets to match the rest of the  book by putting some stain in the size. For staining there are many  things used. A weak solution of permanganate of potash gives a  yellowish stain that will be found to match many papers. Other stains  are used, such as coffee, chicory, tea, liquorice, &c. Whatever is  used should be put in the size. To ascertain that the right depth of  colour has been obtained, a piece of unsized paper, such as white  blotting-paper, is dipped in the stained size and blotted off and  dried before the fire. It is impossible to judge of the depth of  colour in a stain unless the test piece is thoroughly dried. If the  stain is not right, add more water or more stain as is needed.  Experience will tell what stain to use to match the paper of any given  book.    To remove grease or oil stains, ether may be used. Pour it freely in a  circle round the spot, narrowing the circle gradually until the stain  is covered. Then apply a warm iron through a piece of blotting-paper.    Ether should only be used in a draught in a well-ventilated room on  account of its well-known inflammable and anaesthetical properties.    A very dilute (about one per cent.) solution of pure hydrochloric acid  in cold water will be found to take out some stains if the paper is  left in it for some hours. When the paper is removed from the  solution, it must be thoroughly washed in running water. It is  important that the hydrochloric acid used should be pure, as the  commercial quality (spirits of salts) often contains sulphuric acid.    The following recipes are quoted from _De l'organisation et de  l'administration des Bibliotheques, par Jules Cusin_:--    To remove stains from paper:--\"_Mud Stains._--To take away these kinds  of stains, spread some soap jelly very evenly over the stained places,  and leave it there for thirty or forty minutes, according to the depth  of the stain. Then dip the sheet in clean water, and then having  spread it on a perfectly clean table, remove the soap lightly with a  hog's hair brush or a fine sponge; all the mud will disappear at the  same time. Put the sheet into the clear water again, to get rid of the  last trace of soap. Let it drain a little, press it lightly between  two sheets of blotting-paper, and finish by letting it dry slowly in  a dry place in the shade.    \"_Stains of Tallow, Stearine, or Fat._--To take away these stains  cover them with blotting-paper and pass over them a warm flat-iron.  When the paper has soaked up the grease, change it and repeat the  operation until the stains have been sufficiently removed. After that,  touch both sides of the sheets where they have been stained with a  brush dipped in essence of turpentine heated to boiling-point. Then to  restore the whiteness of the paper, touch the places which were  stained with a piece of fine linen soaked in purified spirits of wine  warmed in the water-bath. This method may also be employed to get rid  of sealing-wax stains.    \"_Oil Stains._--Make a mixture of 500 gr. of soap, 300 gr. of clay, 60  gr. of quicklime, and sufficient water to make it of the right  consistency, spread a thin layer of this on the stain, and leave it  there about a quarter of an hour. Then dip the sheet in a bath of hot  water; take it out, and let it dry slowly.    \"You can also use the following method, generally employed for  finger-marks:--    \"_Finger-marks._--These stains are sometimes very obstinate. Still  they can generally be mastered by the following method:--Spread over  them a layer of white soap jelly (_savon blanc en gelee_), and leave  it there for some hours. Then remove this with a fine sponge dipped in  hot water, and more often than not all the dirt disappears at the same  time. If this treatment is not sufficient, you might replace the soap  jelly by soft soap (_savon noir_), but you must be careful not to  leave it long on the printing, which might decompose and run, and that  would do more harm than good.\"    Sheets of very old books are best left with the stains of age upon  them, excepting, perhaps, such as can be removed with hot water or  size. Nearly all stains _can_ be removed, but in the process old paper  is apt to lose more in character than it gains in appearance.                                      MENDING    For mending torn sheets of an old book, some paper that matches as  nearly as possible must be found. For this purpose it is the custom  for bookbinders to collect quantities of old paper. If a piece of the  same tone cannot be found, paper of similar texture and substance may  be stained to match.    Supposing a corner to be missing, and a piece of paper to have been  found that matches it, the torn page is laid over the new paper in  such a way that the wire marks on both papers correspond. Then the  point of a folder should be drawn along the edge of the torn sheet,  leaving an indented line on the new paper. The new paper should then  be cut off about an eighth of an inch beyond the indented line, and  the edge carefully pared up to the line. The edge of the old paper  must be similarly pared, so that the two edges when laid together will  not exceed the thickness of the rest of the page. It is well to leave  a little greater overlap at the edges of the page. Both cut edges must  then be well pasted with white paste and rubbed down between  blotting-paper. To ensure a perfectly clean joint the pasted edge  should not be touched with the hand, and pasting-paper, brushes, and  paste must be perfectly clean.    In the case of a tear across the page, if there are any overlapping  edges, they may merely be pasted together and the end of the tear at  the edge of the paper strengthened by a small piece of pared"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26679"],[0,"Wit and Mirth: or Pills to Purge Melancholy, Vol. 5 of 6 (#7)"],[1,"Courage.    His Knowledge yet in Feats of Arms,    As yet is very small;  His tender Joints more fitter are,    To toss a Tennis-ball.    A Tun of Tennis-balls therefore,    In Pride and great Disdain;  He sent unto this Royal King,    To recompence his Pain.    Which Answer when our King did hear,    He waxed wroth in Heart;  And swore he would provide such Balls,    Should make all _France_ to smart.    An Army then our King did hold,    Which was both good and strong;  And from _Southampton_ is our King,    With all his Navy gone.    In _France_ he landed safe and sound,    Both he and all his Train;  And to the Town of _Husle_ then    He marched up amain.    Which when he had besieg'd the Town,    Against the fenced Walls;  To batter down the stately Towers,    He sent his _English_ Balls.    When this was done our King did march,    Then up and down the Land;  And not a _Frenchman_ for his Life,    Durst once his Force withstand.    Until he came to _Agencourt_,    Whereas it was his chance;  To find the King in readiness,    With all the Power of _France_.    A mighty Host he had prepar'd,    Of Armed Soldiers then;  Which were no less by just Account,    Than Forty Thousand Men.    Which sight did much amaze our King,    For he and all his Host;  Not passing Fifteen Thousand had,    Accounted with the most.    The King of _France_ who well did know,    The Number of our Men;  In vaunting Pride and great Disdain,    Did send an Herald then:    To understand what he would give,    For Ransom of his Life,  When they in Field had taken him,    Amongst the bloody strife.    And when our King with cheerful Heart,    This answer then did make;  Before that it does come to pass,    Some of your Hearts will ake.    And to your proud presumptuous King,    Declare this thing, quoth he;  My own Heart's-blood will pay the Price,    Nought else he gets of me.    Then spake the noble Duke of _York_,    O noble King, quoth he,  The Leading of this Battle brave,    It doth belong to me.    God-a-mercy Cousin _York_, he said,    I grant thee thy Request;  Then lead thou on couragiously,    And I will lead the rest.    Then came the bragging _Frenchmen_ down,    With cruel Force and Might;  With whom our Noble King began,    A fierce and dreadful Fight.    The Archers they discharg'd their Shafts,    As thick as Hail from Skie;  And many a _Frenchman_ in the Field,    That happy Day did die.    Their Horses tumbled on the Stakes,    And so their Lives they lost;  And many a _Frenchman_ there was ta'en,    As Prisoners to their cost.    Ten Thousand Men that Day was slain,    As Enemies in the Field:  And eke as many Prisoners,    Were forc'd that Day to yield.    Thus had our King a happy Day,    And Victory over _France_;  And brought them quickly under foot    That late in Pride did prance.

And whilst he did in Chace remain,    To see both Sport and Play;  His Lady went as she did feign,    Unto the Church to pray.    This Lord he had a Daughter Fair,    Whose Beauty shin'd so bright;  She was belov'd both far and near,    Of many a Lord and Knight.    Fair _Isabella_ was she call'd,    A Creature Fair was she;  She was her Father's only Joy,    As you shall after see.    But yet her Cruel Step-Mother,    Did Envy her so much;  That Day by Day she sought her Life,    Her Malice it was such.    She bargain'd with the Master-Cook,    To take her Life away;  And taking of her Daughter's Book,    She thus to her did say.    Go home, sweet Daughter, I thee pray.    Go hasten presently;  And tell unto the Master-Cook,    These Words which I tell thee.    And bid him dress to Dinner straight,    That fair and milk-white Doe;  That in the Park doth shine so bright,    There's none so fair to show.    This Lady fearing of no harm,    Obey'd her Mother's Will;  And presently she hasted home,    Her Mind for to fulfil.    She straight into the Kitchin went,    Her Message for to tell,  And there the Master-Cook she spy'd,    Who did with Malice swell.    Now Master-Cook it must be so,    Do that which I thee tell;  You needs must dress the milk-white Doe,    Which you do know full well.    Then straight his cruel bloody Hands,    He on the Lady laid;  Who quivering and shaking stands,    While thus to her he said:    Thou art the Doe that I must dress,    See here, behold my Knife;  For it is Pointed presently,    To rid thee of thy Life.    O then cry'd out the Scullion Boy,    As loud as loud might be;  O save her Life, good Master-Cook,    And make your Pies of me?    For pity sake do not destroy    My Lady with your Knife;  You know she is her Father's Joy,    For Christ's sake save her Life.    I will not save her Life he said,    Nor make my Pies of thee;  Yet if thou dost this Deed betray,    Thy Butcher I will be;    Now when this Lord he did come home,    For to sit down to Meat;  He called for his Daughter dear,    To come and carve his Meat.    Now sit you down, his Lady said,    O sit you down to Meat;  Into some Nunnery she's gone,    Your Daughter dear forget.    Then solemnly he made a Vow,    Before the Company;  That he would neither eat nor drink,    Until he did her see.    O then bespoke the Scullion Boy,    With a loud Voice so high;  If that you will your Daughter see    My Lord cut up the Pye.    Wherein her Flesh is minced small,    And parched with the Fire;  All caused by her Step-Mother,    Who did her Death desire.    And cursed be the Master-Cook,    O cursed may he be!  I proffer'd him my own Heart's Blood,    From Death to set her free.    Then all in Black this Lord did Mourn,    And for his Daughter's sake;  He judged for her Step-Mother,    To be burnt at a Stake.    Likewise he judg'd the Master-Cook,    In boyling Lead to stand;  He made the simple Scullion Boy,    The Heir to all his Land.          _A_ BALLAD    _In Praise of a certain Commander in the City._      [Music]    A Heroe of no small Renown,    But noted for a Man of Mettle;  Thro' all the Parts of _London_ Town,  No Gentleman, nor yet a Clown,    No grave wise man, nor stupid Beetle.    By many Deeds of Prowess done,    He's gain'd a matchless Reputation;  Perform'd by neither Sword nor Gun,  But by what means you'll know anon,    And how he work'd his Preservation.    Well mounted on a noble Steed,    With Sword and Pistol charg'd before him;  Altho' we must confess indeed,  Of either Arms there was no need,    His Conduct did alone secure him.    With's Wife upon a single Horse,    T'wards _Eppin_ both rid out together;  But what than ill Luck can be worse,  A High-way-Man of equal Force,    Alass, obstructed both their Pleasure.    With Pistol cock'd he made demand,    And told them he must have their Money;  The Major wisely would not stand,  Nor on his Pistols clap a Hand,    He was not such a Fighting Tony.    But spur'd away as swift as Wind,    No Elk or Tyger could run faster;  Was ever Man so stout and kind,  To leave his frighted Wife behind,    Expos'd to such a sad Disaster.    Her Necklace, Cloaths and Diamond Ring,    The greedy Robber quickly fell to;  One Petticoat he let her bring  Away with Smock, and t'other Thing,    To let her noble Heroe smell to.    This Slight bred sad domestick Strife,    Altho' the Man's to be commended;  For what's a loving handsome Wife,  To a Man's Money or his Life,    For all is lost when that is ended.          _A_ SONG.

My being so free and kind,    Does make my Heart to rue;  The sad Effects of this I find,    _And cannot tell what to do_.    My Petticoats which I wore,    And likewise my Aprons too;  Alass, they are all too short before,    _I cannot_, &c.    Was ever young Maid so crost,    As I who thank'd him too:  For why, my Maiden-head is lost,    _I cannot tell what to do_.    In sorrowful sort I cry'd,    And may now for ever rue;  The Pain lies in my Back and Side,    _I cannot tell what to do_.    Alass I was kind and mild,    But now the same I rue;  Having no Father for my Child,    _I cannot_, &c.    I took but a Touch in jest,    Believe me this is true;  Yet I have proved, I protest,    _And cannot_, &c.    He crav'd my Virginity,    And gave me his own in lieu;  In this I find I was too kind,    _And cannot_, &c.    Each Damsel will me degrade,    And so will the young Men too;  I'm neither Widow, Wife, nor Maid,    _I cannot_, &c.    A Cradle I must provide,    A Chair and Posset too;  Nay, likewise twenty Things beside,    _I cannot_, &c.    When I was a Maiden fair,    Such Sorrows I never knew;  But now my Heart is full of Care,    _I cannot_, &c.  "]]]
