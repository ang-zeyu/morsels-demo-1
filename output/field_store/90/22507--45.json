Thief!  Thief!'    \"When all the nuts had been brought to her by Mr. Gray Squirrel and Mr.  Fox Squirrel and Mr. Red Squirrel, old Mother Nature gathered them all  up and put them in the secret store-house of Mr. Chipmunk.  Then she  set Mr. Chipmunk up on an old stump where all could see him and she  said:    \"'Mr. Chipmunk, because you have been faithful, because you have been  cheerful, because you have done your best, henceforth you shall have  two pockets, one in each cheek, so that you can carry two nuts at once,  that you may not have to work so hard the next time I tell you to store  a thousand nuts.'    \"And all the little meadow people and all the little forest folks  shouted 'Hurrah for Mr. Chipmunk!'  All but his cousins, Mr. Gray  Squirrel and Mr. Fox Squirrel and Mr. Red Squirrel, who hid themselves  for shame.    \"And ever since that time long ago, when the world was young, the  Chipmunks have had pockets in their cheeks.    \"You can't fool old Mother Nature,\" concluded Great-Grandfather Frog.  \"No, Sir, you can't fool old Mother Nature and it's no use to try.\"    \"Thank you, thank you,\" cried the Merry Little Breezes, clapping their  hands.  Then they all raced across the Green Meadows to shake down some  more nuts for Striped Chipmunk.          VI    REDDY FOX, THE BOASTER    Johnny Chuck waddled down the Lone Little Path across the Green  Meadows.  Johnny Chuck was very fat and rolly-poly.  His yellow brown  coat fitted him so snugly that it seemed as if it must burst.  Johnny  Chuck was feeling very happy--very happy indeed, for you see Johnny  Chuck long ago found the best thing in the world, which is contentment.    Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun, looking down from the sky, smiled and smiled  to see Johnny Chuck waddling down the Lone Little Path, for he loved  the merry-hearted little fellow, as do all the little meadow  people--all but Reddy Fox, for Reddy Fox has not forgotten the surprise  Johnny Chuck once gave him and how he called him a \"'fraid cat.\"    Once in a while Johnny Chuck stopped to brush his coat carefully, for  he is very particular about his appearance, is Johnny Chuck.  By and by  he came to the old butternut tree down by the Smiling Pool.  He could  see it a long time before he reached it, and up in the top of it he  could see Blacky the Crow flapping his wings and cawing at the top of  his voice.    \"There must be something going on,\" said Johnny Chuck to himself, and  began to waddle faster.  He looked so very queer when he tried to hurry  that jolly round, red Mr. Sun smiled more than ever.    When he was almost to the old butter-nut tree Johnny Chuck sat up very  straight so that his head came just above the tall meadow grasses  beside the Lone Little Path.  He could see the Merry Little Breezes  dancing and racing under the old butternut tree and having such a good  time!  And he could see the long ears of Peter Rabbit standing up  straight above the tall meadow grasses.  One of the Merry Little  Breezes spied Johnny Chuck.    \"Hurry up, Johnny Chuck!\" he shouted, and Johnny Chuck hurried.    When he reached the old butternut tree he was all out of breath.  He  was puffing and blowing and he was so warm that he wished just for a  minute, a single little minute, that he could swim like Billy Mink and  Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe Otter, so that he could jump into the  Smiling Pool and cool off.    \"Hello, Johnny Chuck!\" shouted Peter Rabbit.    \"Hello yourself, and see how you like it!\" replied Johnny Chuck.    \"Hello myself!\" said Peter Rabbit.    And then because it was so very foolish everybody laughed.  It is a  good thing to feel foolishly happy on a beautiful sunshiny day,  especially down on the Green Meadows.    Jimmy Skunk was there.  He was feeling very, very good indeed, was  Jimmy Skunk, for he had found some very fine beetles for his breakfast.    Little Joe Otter was there, and Billy Mink and Jerry Muskrat and Happy  Jack Squirrel, and of course Reddy Fox was there.  Oh my, yes, of  course Reddy Fox was there!  Reddy Fox never misses a chance to show  off.  He was wearing his very newest red coat and his whitest  waistcoat.  He had brushed his tail till it looked very handsome, and  every few minutes he would turn and admire it.  Reddy Fox thought  himself a very fine gentleman.  He admired himself and he wanted every  one else to admire him.    \"Let's do stunts,\" said Peter Rabbit.  \"I can jump farther than anybody  here!\"    Then Peter Rabbit jumped a tremendously long jump.  Then everybody  jumped, everybody but Reddy Fox.  Even Johnny Chuck jumped, and because  he was so rolly-poly he tumbled over and over and everybody laughed and  Johnny Chuck laughed loudest of all.    And because his hind legs are long and meant for jumping Peter Rabbit  had jumped farther than any one else.    \"I can climb to the top of the old butternut tree quicker than anybody  else,\" cried Happy Jack Squirrel, and away he started with Bobby Coon  and Billy Mink after him, for though Billy Mink is a famous swimmer and  can run swiftly, he can also climb when he has to.  But Happy Jack  Squirrel was at the top of the old butternut tree almost before the  others had started.    The Merry Little Breezes clapped their hands and everybody shouted for  Happy Jack Squirrel, everybody but Reddy Fox.    \"I can swim faster than anybody here,\" shouted Little Joe Otter.    In a flash three little brown coats splashed into the Smiling Pool so  suddenly that they almost upset Great-Grandfather Frog watching from  his big green lily pad.  They belonged to Little Joe Otter, Billy Mink  and Jerry Muskrat.  Across the Smiling Pool and back again they raced  and Little Joe Otter was first out on the bank.    \"Hurrah for Little Joe Otter!\" shouted Blacky the Crow.    And everybody shouted \"Hurrah!\"  Everybody but Reddy Fox.    \"What can you do, Jimmy Skunk?\" asked Peter Rabbit, dancing up and  down, he was so excited.    Jimmy Skunk yawned lazily.    \"I can throw a wonderful perfume farther than anybody here,\" said Jimmy  Skunk.    \"We know it!  We know it!\" shouted the Merry Little Breezes as  everybody tumbled heels over head away from Jimmy Skunk, even Reddy  Fox.  \"But please don't!\"    And Jimmy Skunk didn't.    Then they all came back, Reddy Fox carefully brushing his handsome red  coat which had become sadly mussed, he had fled in such a hurry.    Now for the first time in his life Johnny Chuck began to feel just a  wee, wee bit discontented.  What was there he could do better than any  one else?  He couldn't jump and he couldn't climb and he couldn't swim.  He couldn't even run fast, because he was so fat and round and  rolly-poly.  He quite forgot that he was so sunny-hearted and  good-natured that everybody loved him, everybody but Reddy Fox.    Just then Reddy Fox began to boast, for Reddy Fox is a great boaster.  \"Pooh!\" said Reddy Fox, \"pooh!  Anybody could jump if their legs were  made for jumping.  And what's the good of climbing trees anyway?  Now I  can run faster than anybody here--faster than anybody in the whole  world!\" said Reddy Fox, puffing himself out.    \"Chug-a-rum,\" said Grandfather Frog.  \"You can't beat Spotty the  Turtle.\"    Then everyone shouted and rolled over and over in the grass, they were  so tickled, for every one remembered how Spotty the Turtle had once won  a race from Reddy Fox.    For a minute Reddy Fox looked very foolish.  Then he lost his temper,  which is a very unwise thing to do, for it is hard to find again.  He  swelled himself out until every hair stood on end and he looked twice  as big as he did before.  He strutted up and down and glared at each in  turn.    \"And I'm not afraid of any living thing on the Green Meadows!\" boasted  Reddy Fox.    \"Chug-a-rum,\" said Grandfather Frog.  \"Do I see Bowser the Hound?\"    Every hair on Reddy Fox suddenly fell back into place.  He whirled  about nervously and anxiously looked over the Green Meadows.  Then  everybody shouted again and rolled over and over in the grass and held  on to their sides, for you see Bowser the Hound wasn't there at all.    But everybody took good care to keep away from Reddy Fox, everybody but  Johnny Chuck.  He just sat still and chuckled and chuckled till his fat  sides shook.    \"What are you laughing at?\" demanded Reddy Fox.    \"I was just thinking,\" said Johnny Chuck, \"that though you can run so  fast, you can't even catch me.\"    Reddy Fox just glared at him for a minute, he was so mad.  Then he  sprang straight at Johnny Chuck.    \"I'll show you!\" he snarled.    Now Johnny Chuck had been sitting close beside a hole that Grandfather  Chuck had dug a long time before and which was empty.  In a flash  Johnny Chuck disappeared head first in the hole.  Now the hole was too  small for Reddy Fox to enter, but he was so angry that he straightway  began to dig it larger.  My, how the sand did fly!  It poured out  behind Reddy Fox in a stream of shining yellow.    Johnny Chuck ran down the long tunnel underground until he reached the  end.  Then when he heard Reddy Fox digging and knew that he was really  coming, Johnny Chuck began to dig, too, only instead of digging down he  dug up towards the sunshine and the blue sky.    My, how his short legs did fly and his stout little claws dug into the  soft earth!  His little forepaws flew so fast that if you had been  there you could hardly have seen them at all.  And with his strong hind  legs he kicked the sand right back into the face of Reddy Fox.    All the little meadow people gathered around the hole where Johnny  Chuck and Reddy Fox had disappeared.  They were very anxious, very  anxious indeed.  Would Reddy Fox catch Johnny Chuck?  And what would he  do to him?  Was all their fun to end in something terrible to  sunny-hearted, merry Johnny Chuck, whom everybody loved?

And then it was the Jews who changed their minds--some of them. They  wanted to send their children to school, to learn histories and  sciences, because they had discovered that there was good in such  things as well as in the Sacred Law. These people were called  progressive, but they had no chance to progress. All the czars that  came along persisted in the old idea, that for the Jew no door should  be opened,--no door out of the Pale, no door out of their mediaevalism.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] A four-cornered cloth with specially prepared fringes is worn by  pious males under the outer garments, but with, the fringes showing.  The latter play a part in the daily ritual.          CHAPTER II    CHILDREN OF THE LAW      As I look back to-day I see, within the wall raised around my  birthplace by the vigilance of the police, another wall, higher,  thicker, more impenetrable. This is the wall which the Czar with all  his minions could not shake, the priests with their instruments of  torture could not pierce, the mob with their firebrands could not  destroy. This wall within the wall is the religious integrity of the  Jews, a fortress erected by the prisoners of the Pale, in defiance of  their jailers; a stronghold built of the ruins of their pillaged  homes, cemented with the blood of their murdered children.    Harassed on every side, thwarted in every normal effort, pent up  within narrow limits, all but dehumanized, the Russian Jew fell back  upon the only thing that never failed him,--his hereditary faith in  God. In the study of the Torah he found the balm for all his wounds;  the minute observance of traditional rites became the expression of  his spiritual cravings; and in the dream of a restoration to Palestine  he forgot the world.    What did it matter to us, on a Sabbath or festival, when our life was  centred in the synagogue, what czar sat on the throne, what evil  counsellors whispered in his ear? They were concerned with revenues  and policies and ephemeral trifles of all sorts, while we were intent  on renewing our ancient covenant with God, to the end that His promise  to the world should be fulfilled, and His justice overwhelm the  nations.    On a Friday afternoon the stores and markets closed early. The clatter  of business ceased, the dust of worry was laid, and the Sabbath peace  flooded the quiet streets. No hovel so mean but what its casement sent  out its consecrated ray, so that a wayfarer passing in the twilight  saw the spirit of God brooding over the lowly roof.    Care and fear and shrewishness dropped like a mask from every face.  Eyes dimmed with weeping kindled with inmost joy. Wherever a head bent  over a sacred page, there rested the halo of God's presence.    Not on festivals alone, but also on the common days of the week, we  lived by the Law that had been given us through our teacher Moses. How  to eat, how to bathe, how to work--everything had been written down  for us, and we strove to fulfil the Law. The study of the Torah was  the most honored of all occupations, and they who engaged in it the  most revered of all men.    My memory does not go back to a time when I was too young to know that  God had made the world, and had appointed teachers to tell the people  how to live in it. First came Moses, and after him the great rabbis,  and finally the Rav of Polotzk, who read all day in the sacred books,  so that he could tell me and my parents and my friends what to do  whenever we were in doubt. If my mother cut up a chicken and found  something wrong in it,--some hurt or mark that should not be,--she  sent the housemaid with it to the rav, and I ran along, and saw the  rav look in his big books; and whatever he decided was right. If he  called the chicken \"trefah\" I must not eat of it; no, not if I had to  starve. And the rav knew about everything: about going on a journey,  about business, about marrying, about purifying vessels for Passover.    Another great teacher was the dayyan, who heard people's quarrels and  settled them according to the Law, so that they should not have to go  to the Gentile courts. The Gentiles were false, judges and witnesses  and all. They favored the rich man against the poor, the Christian  against the Jew. The dayyan always gave true judgments. Nohem  Rabinovitch, the richest man in Polotzk, could not win a case against  a servant maid, unless he were in the right.    Besides the rav and the dayyan there were other men whose callings  were holy,--the shohat, who knew how cattle and fowls should be  killed; the hazzan and the other officers of the synagogue; the  teachers of Hebrew, and their pupils. It did not matter how poor a man  was, he was to be respected and set above other men, if he were  learned in the Law.    In the synagogue scores of men sat all day long over the Hebrew books,  studying and disputing from early dawn till candles were brought in at  night, and then as long as the candles lasted. They could not take  time for anything else, if they meant to become great scholars. Most  of them were strangers in Polotzk, and had no home except the  synagogue. They slept on benches, on tables, on the floor; they picked  up their meals wherever they could. They had come from distant cities,  so as to be under good teachers in Polotzk; and the townspeople were  proud to support them by giving them food and clothing and sometimes  money to visit their homes on holidays. But the poor students came in  such numbers that there were not enough rich families to provide for  all, so that some of them suffered privation. You could pick out a  poor student in a crowd, by his pale face and shrunken form.    There was almost always a poor student taking meals at our house. He  was assigned a certain day, and on that day my grandmother took care  to have something especially good for dinner. It was a very shabby  guest who sat down with us at table, but we children watched him with  respectful eyes. Grandmother had told us that he was a lamden  (scholar), and we saw something holy in the way he ate his cabbage.    Not every man could hope to be a rav, but no Jewish boy was allowed to  grow up without at least a rudimentary knowledge of Hebrew. The  scantiest income had to be divided so as to provide for the boys'  tuition. To leave a boy without a teacher was a disgrace upon the  whole family, to the remotest relative. For the children of the  destitute there was a free school, supported by the charity of the  pious. And so every boy was sent to heder (Hebrew school) almost as  soon as he could speak; and usually he continued to study until his  confirmation, at thirteen years of age, or as much longer as his  talent and ambition carried him. My brother was five years old when he  entered on his studies. He was carried to the heder, on the first day,  covered over with a praying-shawl, so that nothing unholy should look  on him; and he was presented with a bun, on which were traced, in  honey, these words: \"The Torah left by Moses is the heritage of the  children of Jacob.\"    After a boy entered heder, he was the hero of the family. He was  served before the other children at table, and nothing was too good  for him. If the family were very poor, all the girls might go  barefoot, but the heder boy must have shoes; he must have a plate of  hot soup, though the others ate dry bread. When the rebbe (teacher)  came on Sabbath afternoon, to examine the boy in the hearing of the  family, everybody sat around the table and nodded with satisfaction,  if he read his portion well; and he was given a great saucerful of  preserves, and was praised, and blessed, and made much of. No wonder  he said, in his morning prayer, \"I thank Thee, Lord, for not having  created me a female.\" It was not much to be a girl, you see. Girls  could not be scholars and rabbonim.    I went to my brother's heder, sometimes, to bring him his dinner, and  saw how the boys studied. They sat on benches around the table, with  their hats on, of course, and the sacred fringes hanging beneath their  jackets. The rebbe sat at an end of the table, rehearsing two or three  of the boys who were studying the same part, pointing out the words  with his wooden pointer, so as not to lose the place. Everybody read  aloud, the smallest boys repeating the alphabet in a sing-song, while  the advanced boys read their portions in a different sing-song; and  everybody raised his voice to its loudest so as to drown the other  voices. The good boys never took their eyes off their page, except to  ask the rebbe a question; but the naughty boys stared around the room,  and kicked each other under the table, till the rebbe caught them at  it. He had a ruler for striking the bad boys on the knuckles, and in a  corner of the room leaned a long birch wand for pupils who would not  learn their lessons.    The boys came to heder before nine in the morning, and remained until  eight or nine in the evening. Stupid pupils, who could not remember  the lesson, sometimes had to stay till ten. There was an hour for  dinner and play at noon. Good little boys played quietly in their  places, but most of the boys ran out of the house and jumped and  yelled and quarrelled.    There was nothing in what the boys did in heder that I could not have  done--if I had not been a girl. For a girl it was enough if she could  read her prayers in Hebrew, and follow the meaning by the Yiddish  translation at the bottom of the page. It did not take long to learn  this much,--a couple of terms with a rebbetzin (female teacher),--and  after that she was done with books.    A girl's real schoolroom was her mother's kitchen. There she learned  to bake and cook and manage, "]]]
