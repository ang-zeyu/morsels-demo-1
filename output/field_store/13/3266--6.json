[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#11)"],[1,"those types of classic  composition universally acknowledged to be the best, as a defensible  standard (to say the least), we find that such a page of music exhibits  the pursuit of some leading thought (melodic motive or phrase), with  precisely the same coherence and consistency, the same evidence of  determined aim, as is displayed in the creation of a forcible essay, a  masterly poem, an imposing architectural plan, or any other work of art  that betrays intelligence and a definite, fixed, purpose.  This is no  more nor less than might be expected from the dominion of the law of  Unity.    The equally inflexible demands of Variety are satisfied by presenting  this self-same leading thought in ever new and changing aspects,--_not_  by exchanging the thought itself for a new one at each successive angle.  This latter faulty process would naturally lead to a conglomeration of  impressions, baffling comprehension and jeopardizing real enjoyment.    In a classic page of music we perceive that each successive unit grows,  more or less directly, out of those which go before; not so directly, or  with such narrow insistence as to produce the impression of sameness and  monotony, but with such consistency of design as to impart a unified  physiognomy to the whole.  Hence, it will often be found that every  melodic figure, during a certain section (if not the whole) of a  composition, may be traced to one or another of the figures which  characterized the first phrase, or the first two or three phrases, of the  piece.  This was emphasized by our reference, near the end of the first  chapter, to the 8th Song Without Words of Mendelssohn.  If the student,  in analyzing the melody of that composition, will endeavor to penetrate  some of the clever disguises employed by the composer (for the sake of  Variety), he will find the whole piece reducible to a very few melodic  figures, announced at or near the beginning.  See also No. 45 (C major),  No. 36, No. 26.  Also Schumann, op. 68, No. 7, No. 8, No. 18, No. 23.  Also Beethoven, pianoforte sonata, op. 10, No. 2, last movement; op. 26,  last movement.    In musical composition this process is known as thematic development, and  it generally extends over the whole, or a greater part, of the piece.    Its operation on a smaller scale, with more limited reference to one  phrase alone, effects the development of the phrase _by extension_.    The process of extension or expansion, by means of which the phrase  usually assumes a somewhat irregular length, consists mainly in the  varied repetition of the figures or motives that it contains; and the  continuity of the whole, as extension of the _one phrase_, is maintained  by suppressing the cadence--suspending all cadential interruption--during  the lengthening process.  For example:    [Illustration: Example 39.  Fragment of Mendelssohn.]      These six measures result from a repetition (variated) of the third and  fourth measures of the original--regular--four-measure phrase.  A cadence  is due in the fourth measure, but it is not permitted to assert itself;  and if it did, its cadential force would be neutralized by the entirely  obvious return to (repetition of) the motive just heard.  Further:--    [Illustration: Example 40.  Fragment of Mendelssohn.]      There is no cadence in the fourth measure,--the current of the melody  obliterates it and hurries on, voicing the last measure again and again  until it dies away in the tenth measure, where a cadence ends it.  That  it should be the _tenth_ measure is purely accidental; the number of  measures is of little account in the act of extension; here, it was  continued until a convenient place was found (with reference to chord and  key) for the cadence.  Further:--    [Illustration: Example 41.  Fragment of Mendelssohn.]    Measures 1, 2, 3 and 8 constitute the original regular four-measure  phrase.    The following regular phrase (to be found in the last movement of  Beethoven's pianoforte sonata, op. 28):--    [Illustration: Example 42.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    is immediately followed by this lengthy and elaborate extension:--    [Illustration: Example 43.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    [Illustration: Example 43 continued.]      The portion marked _b_ is a complete repetition, with quaint variation,  of the original four-measure phrase, marked _a_ in Ex. 42; _c_ is a  repetition of the last figure (just one measure) of the phrase, with the  melodic parts inverted, or exchanged; _d_ and _e_ are a literal  repetition of the two preceding measures--(_c_) and _c_; _f_ is another  recurrence of (_c_), with still another inversion of the melodies; _g_  repeats _e_ an octave higher; and _h_ is nothing more or less than a  curious repetition of _g_, in longer tones, and in reversed direction.  Distinct cadential interruption is carefully avoided after the original  phrase has been announced, that is, throughout Ex. 43,--which is the  significant proof (borne out by the manifest identity of the _melodic_  members) that these measures form part and parcel of the original phrase,  as extension or development of it, and _not_ a new phrase.   The total  length is sixteen measures, developed thus out of the original four.    For an exhaustive explanation of phrase-extension, with all the technical  details, the student is referred to my HOMOPHONIC FORMS, Chapter III.          *      *      *      *      *      *    Another method of extending a phrase consists in prefacing a measure or  two of purely _introductory_ material; it is, therefore, rather  anticipation than prolongation, and is composed most commonly of the  figure of the accompaniment, announced briefly before the actual  phrase-melody begins.    This is shown very clearly in the first measure of the 22d Song Without  Words; also in the first measure of No. 7, No. 31, No. 42, No. 40, and  others; the first _two_ measures of No. 34, and No. 1; the first _three_  measures of No. 19, No. 26, and No. 37,--and needs no further  illustration.  It emphasizes the necessity of vigilance in defining the  correct _starting-point_ of the first phrase; for a mistake at the  beginning may interfere seriously with the locating of the cadences  (according to our fundamental four-measure rule).  For instance, in No.  42 the cadences do _not_ fall in the 4th, 8th, 12th measures--and so  on--but in the 5th, 9th, 13th, 17th, from the very beginning of the piece.    When the introductory passage is longer than _three_ measures, it  probably constitutes a complete phrase by itself, with its own cadence;  in which case, of course, it must not be analyzed as \"extension.\"  For  example, at the beginning of No. 29; still more apparently at the  beginning of No. 28, No. 41, and others.          *      *      *      *      *      *    INHERENT IRREGULARITY.--Finally,--there exists another, third, condition,  besides those mentioned at the head of this chapter, whereby a phrase may  assume an irregular dimension; not by doubling or dividing its length (as  in the large and small phrases) nor by the processes of extension,--but  by an arbitrary and apparently incalculable act of _melodic liberty_,--by  allowing the melody to choose its own time for the cadential  interruption.  This comparatively rare occurrence is illustrated in Ex.  17, No. 1 (five-measure phrase), and Ex. 17, No. 2, second phrase (six  measures long).  It is true that in each of these cases the \"extra\"  measures might be accounted for as \"extension by modified  repetition,\"--for instance, in No. 1 the _second_ measure might be called  a reproduction (or extension) of the first measure.  But cases will be  encountered where a phrase of three, five, six, or seven measures will  admit of no such analysis.  In such instances the student is compelled to  rely simply upon the evidence of _the cadence_.  As was advised in the  context of Ex. 17, he must endeavor to define the phrase by recognition  of its \"beginning\" and \"ending,\" as such; or by exercising his judgment  of the \"cadential impression.\"  See also Ex. 48, second phrase (six  measures).    See Schubert, pianoforte sonata No. 1 (A minor, op. 42)  _Scherzo_-movement; first 28 measures, divided into 5 phrases,--as  demonstrated by the melodic formation--of 5, 5, 5, 7 and 6 measures.  Also Schubert, _Impromptu_, op. 90, No. 3, measures 42 to 55 (phrases of  5, 5 and 4 measures.)      LESSON 6.  Analyze the following examples, locating the cadences and  defining their value (as perfect or semicadence); and determining the  nature of each irregular phrase (as small, large, or extended phrase):    Beethoven, pianoforte sonata, op. 22, second movement (_Adagio_), first  30 measures.    Beethoven, pianoforte sonata, op. 28, _Scherzo_-movement.    Beethoven, pianoforte sonata, op. 14, No. 3, _Menuetto_.    Mendelssohn, Songs Without Words: No. 4, first 5 measures.    No. 46, last 9 1/2 measures.    No. 42, last 15 measures.    No. 45, last 11 measures.    No. 12, last 12 measures.    No. 14, last 11 measures.    No. 36, last 22 measures.    No. 37, last 11 measures.    Beethoven, pianoforte sonata, op. 27, No. 2, last movement; measures 7 to  23 from the second double-bar.    Beethoven, pianoforte sonata, op. 28, first movement; from the double-bar  (near the middle of the movement) measures 21 to 94 (_fermata_ symbol);  in this extraordinary specimen of phrase-development, the original  four-measure phrase yields seventy-four successive measures, with very  few cadences to divide it even into sections.  Same sonata, last  movement, last eighteen measures.          CHAPTER VII.  THE PERIOD-FORM.    PHRASE-ADDITION.--The phrase is the structural basis of all musical  composition.  By this is meant, not necessarily the single phrase, but  the phrase in its collective sense.    The phrase is, after all, only a unit; and the requirements of Variety  cannot be wholly satisfied by the mere development and extension of a  single phrase, except "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19368"],[0,"The Mide'wiwin or \"Grand Medicine Society\" of the Ojibwa (#11)"],[1,"must elapse before the Otter was permitted  to view the entrance.      [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Peep-hole post.]      When the Otter approached the fourth degree (No. 118) he came to a    short post (No. 119) in which there was a small aperture. The post was    painted green on the side from which he approached and red upon the    side toward the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n [see Fig. 4.] But before he was    permitted to look through it he rested and invoked the favor of    Ki/tshi Man/id[-o], that the evil man/id[-o]s might be expelled from    his path. Then, when the Otter looked through the post, he saw that    the interior of the inclosure was filled with Mid[-e]/ Man/idos, ready    to receive him and to attend during his initiation. The two Mid[-e]/    Man/idos at the outside of the eastern entrance (Nos. 120 and 121)    compelled the evil man/id[-o]s (Nos. 122 and 123) to depart and permit    the Otter to enter at the door (No. 124). Then the Otter beheld the    sacred stone (No. 125) and the five heaps of sacred objects which    Minab[-o]/zho had deposited (Nos. 126, 127, 128, 129, and 130) near    the four degree posts (Nos. 131, 132, 133, and 134). According to    their importance, the first was painted red, with a green band about    the top; the second was painted red, with two green bands, one at the    top and another at the middle; the third consisted of a cross painted    red, with the tips of the arms and the top of the post painted green;    while the fourth was a square post, the side toward the east being    painted white, that toward the south green, that toward the west red,    and that toward the north black.      The two sets of sticks (Nos. 135 and 136) near the eastern and western    doors represent the legs of Makwa/ Man/id[-o], the Bear Spirit. When    the Otter had observed all these things he passed round the interior    of the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n four times, after which he seated himself in    the west, facing the degree posts, when Mi/nab[-o]/zho approached him    and for the fourth time shot into his body the sacred m[-i]/gis, which    gave him life that will endure always. Then Mi/nab[-o]/zho said to the    Otter, \"This degree belongs to Ki/tshi Man/ido, the Great Spirit (Nos.    137 and 138), who will always be present when you give the sacred rite    to any of your people.\" At night the Mid[-e]/ Man/id[-o]s (Nos. 139 to    162) will guard the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n, as they are sent by Ki/tshi    Man/ido to do so. The Bear's nest (Nos. 163 and 164) just beyond the    northern and southern doors (Nos. 165 and 166) of the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n    are the places where Makwa/ Man/id[-o] takes his station when guarding    the doors.      Then the Otter made a wig/iwam and offered four prayers (Nos. 167,    168, 169, and 170) for the rites of the Mid[-e]/wiwin, which Ki/tshi    Man/id[-o] had given him.      [Illustration: Plate VII.    Ojibwa Facial Decoration.]    The following supplemental explanations were added by Sikas/sig[)e],  viz: The four vertical lines at the outer angles of the lodge structure  (Nos. 171, 172, 173, and 174), and four similar ones on the inner  corners (Nos. 175, 176, 177, and 178), represent eight cedar trees  planted there by the Mid[-e]/ at the time of preparing the  Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n for the reception of candidates. The circles Nos. 179,  180, and 181, and the connecting line, are a reproduction of similar  ones shown in the three preceding degrees, and signify the course of a  Mid[-e]'s life--that it should be without fault and in strict accordance  with the teachings of the Mid[-e]/wiwin. The short lines, terminating in  circles Nos. 182, 183, 184, and 185, allude to temptations which beset  the Mid[-e]'s path, and he shall, when so tempted, offer at these points  feasts and lectures, or, in other words, \"professions of faith.\" The  three lines Nos. 186, 187, and 188, consisting of four spots each, which  radiate from the larger circle at No. 179 and that before mentioned at  No. 116, symbolize the four bear nests and their respective approaches,  which are supposed to be placed opposite the four doors of the fourth  degree; and it is obligatory, therefore, for a candidate to enter these  four doors on hands and knees when appearing for his initiation and  before he finally waits to receive the concluding portion of the  ceremony.      [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Migration of [^A]n['i]shin[^a]/beg.]    The illustration presented in Fig. 5 is a reduced copy of a drawing made  by Sikas/sig[)e] to represent the migration of the Otter toward the west  after he had received the rite of the Mid[-e]/wiwin. No. 1 refers to the  circle upon the large chart on Pl. III in A, No. 1, and signifies the  earth's surface as before described. No. 2 in Fig. 5 is a line  separating the history of the Mid[-e]/wiwin from that of the migration  as follows: When the Otter had offered four prayers, as above mentioned,  which fact is referred to by the spot No. 3, he disappeared beneath the  surface of the water and went toward the west, whither the  Ani/shin[^a]/b[-e]g followed him, and located at Ottawa Island (No. 4).  Here they erected the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n and lived for many years. Then  the Otter again disappeared beneath the water, and in a short time  reappeared at A/wiat/ang (No. 5), when the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n was again  erected and the sacred rites conducted in accordance with the teachings  of Mi/nab[-o]/zho. Thus was an interrupted migration continued, the  several resting places being given below in their proper order, at each  of which the rites of the Mid[-e]/wiwin were conducted in all their  purity. The next place to locate at was Mi/shenama/kinagung-- Mackinaw  (No. 6); then Ne/mikung (No. 7); Kiwe/winang/ (No. 8); B[^a]wating--  Sault Ste. Marie (No. 9); Tshiwi/towi/ (No. 10); Nega/wadzh[)e]/[)u]--  Sand Mountain (No. 11), northern shore of Lake Superior; Mi/nisa/w[)i]k  [Mi/nisa/bikk[)a]ng]-- Island of rocks (No. 12);  Kawa/sitsh[)i][)u]wongk-- Foaming rapids (No. 13); Mush/kisi/wi  [Mash/kisi/bi]-- Bad River (No. 14); Shagaw[^a]mikongk--  Long-sand-bar-beneath-the-surface (No. 15); Wikwe/d[^a][n]wongg[^a][n]--  Sandy Bay (No. 16); Ne[^a]/shiwikongk-- Cliff Point (No. 17);  Net[^a][n]/waya[n]/sink-- Little point-of-sand-bar (No. 18);  A[n]/nibi[n]s-- Little elm tree (No. 19); Wikup/bi[n]mi[n]sh-literally,  Little-island-basswood (No. 20); Makubi[n]/mi[n]sh-- Bear Island (No.  21); Sha/geski/ke/dawan/ga (No. 22); Ni/wigwas/sikongk-- The place where  bark is peeled (No. 23); Ta/pakwe/[)i]kak [Sa/apakwe/shkwaokongk]--  The-place-where-lodge-bark-is-obtained (No. 24); Ne/uwesak/kudeze/bi  [Ne/wisaku/desi/bi[n]]-- Point-deadwood-timber river (No. 25);  A[n]nibi/kanzi/bi [modern name, [^A]sh/kiba/gisi/bi], given respectively  as Fish spawn River and Green leaf River (No. 26).    This last-named locality is said to be Sandy Lake, Minnesota, where the  Otter appeared for the last time, and where the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n was  finally located. From La Pointe, as well as from Sandy Lake, the Ojibwa  claim to have dispersed in bands over various portions of the territory,  as well as into Wisconsin, which final separation into distinct bodies  has been the chief cause of the gradual changes found to exist in the  ceremonies of the Mid[-e]/wiwin.    According to Sikas/sig[)e], the above account of the initiation of the  Otter, by Mi/nabo/zho, was adopted as the course of initiation by the  Mid[-e]/ priests of the Mille Lacs Society, when he himself received the  first degree, 1830. At that time a specific method of facial decoration  was pursued by the priests of the respective degrees (Pl. VI), each  adopting that pertaining to the highest degree to which he was entitled,  viz:    _First degree._--A broad band of green across the forehead and a narrow  stripe of vermilion across the face, just below the eyes.    _Second degree._--A narrow stripe of vermilion across the temples, the  eyelids, and the root of the nose, a short distance above which is a  similar stripe of green, then another of vermilion, and above this again  one of green.    _Third degree._--Red and white spots are daubed all over the face, the  spots being as large as can be made by the finger tips in applying the  colors.    _Fourth degree._--Two forms of decoration were admissible; for the  first, the face was painted with vermilion, with a stripe of green  extending diagonally across it from the upper part of the left temporal  region to the lower part of the right cheek; for the second, the face  was painted red with two short, horizontal parallel bars of green across  the forehead. Either of these was also employed as a sign of mourning by  one whose son has been intended for the priesthood of the Mid[-e]/wiwin,  but special reference to this will be given in connection with the  ceremony of the Dzhibai/ Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n, or Ghost Society.    On Pl. VIII is presented a reduced copy of the Mid[-e]/ chart made by  Ojibwa, a Mid[-e]/ priest of the fourth degree and formerly a member of  the society of the Sandy Lake band of the Mississippi Ojibwa. The  illustration is copied from his own chart which he received in 1833 in  imitation of that owned by his father, Me/toshi/k[-o][n]sh; and this  last had been received from Lake Superior, presumably La Pointe, many  years before.    The illustration of the four degrees are here represented in profile,  and shows higher artistic skill than the preceding copies from Red Lake,  and Mille Lacs.    The information given by Ojibwa, regarding the characters is as follows:      When Ki/tshi Man/id[-o] had decided to give to the Ani/shin[^a]/b[-e]g    the rites of the Mid[-e]/wiwin, he took his Mid[-e]/ drum and sang,    calling upon the other Man/id[-o]s to join him and to hear what he was    going to do.
