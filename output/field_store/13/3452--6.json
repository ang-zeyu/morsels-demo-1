My brother's were named Ed, Kato and Willie. I  was third of the boys. My sisters were Lucy, Anne and Alice. My father  first belonged to Robert Wooten of Craven County, N. C. Then he was sold  by the Wootens to the Bectoms of Wayne County, near Goldsboro, the  county seat. My mother first belonged to the McNeills of Cumberland  County. Miss Mary McNeill married a McFadden, and her parents gave my  mother to Mis' Mary. Mis' Mary's daughter in time married Ezekial King  and my mother was then given to her by Mis' Mary McFadden, her mother.  Mis' Lizzie McFadden became a King. My grandmother was named Lucy  Murphy. She belonged to the Murpheys. All the slaves were given off to  the children of the family as they married.    My father and mother told me stories of how they were treated at  different places. When my grandmother was with the Murpheys they would  make her get up, and begin burning logs in new grounds before daybreak.  They also made her plow, the same as any of the men on the plantation.  They plowed till dusk-dark before they left the fields to come to the  house. They were not allowed to attend any dances or parties unless they  slipped off unknowin's. They had candy pullings sometimes too. While  they would be there the patterollers would visit them. Sometimes the  patterollers whipped all they caught at this place, all they set their  hands on, unless they had a pass.    They fed us mighty good. The food was well cooked. They gave the slaves  an acre of ground to plant and they could sell the crop and have the  money. The work on this acre was done on moonshiny nights and holidays.  Sometimes slaves would steal the marster's chickens or a hog and slip  off to another plantation and have it cooked. We had plenty of clothes,  and one pair o' shoes a year. You had to take care of them because you  only got one pair a year. They were given at Christmas every year. The  clothes were made on the plantation.    There were corn mills on the plantation, and rice mills, and threshing  machines. The plantation had about 300 acres in farm land. The enclosure  was three miles. My marster lived in a fine house. It took a year to  build it. There were about 16 rooms in it. We slaves called it the great  house. Some of the slaves ran away and finally reached Ohio. There was  no jail on the plantation. Sometimes the overseer would whip us.    The Kings had no overseers. King beat his slaves with a stick. I  remember seeing him do this as well as I can see that house over there.  He became blind. An owl scratched him in the face when he was trying to  catch him, and his face got into sich a fix he went to Philadelphia for  treatment, but they could not cure him. He finally went blind. I have  seen him beat his slaves after he was blind. I remember it well. He beat  'em with a stick. He was the most sensitive man you ever seed. He ran a  store. After he was blind you could han' him a piece of money and he  could tell you what it was.    There were no churches on the plantation but prayer meeting' were held  in the quarters. Slaves were not allowed to go to the white folk's  church unless they were coach drivers, etc. No sir, not in that  community. They taught the slaves the Bible. The children of the marster  would go to private school. We small Negro children looked after the  babies in the cradles and other young children. When the white children  studied their lessons I studied with them. When they wrote in the sand I  wrote in the sand too. The white children, and not the marster or  mistress, is where I got started in learnin' to read and write.    We had corn shuckings, candy pullings, dances, prayer meetings. We went  to camp meetin' on Camp Meeting days in August when the crops were laid  by. We played games of high jump, jumping over the pole held by two  people, wrestling, leap frog, and jumping. We sang the songs, 'Go tell  Aunt Patsy'. 'Some folks says a nigger wont steal, I caught six in my  corn field' 'Run nigger run, the patteroller ketch you, Run nigger run  like you did the other day'.    When slaves got sick marster looked after them. He gave them blue mass  and caster oil. Dr. McDuffy also treated us. Dr. McSwain vaccinated us  for small pox. My sister died with it. When the slaves died marster  buried them. They dug a grave with a tomb in it. I do not see any of  them now. The slaves were buried in a plain box.    The marsters married the slaves without any papers. All they did was to  say perhaps to Jane and Frank, 'Frank, I pronounce you and Jane man and  wife.' But the woman did not take the name of her husband, she kept the  name of the family who owned her.    I remember seeing the Yankees near Fayetteville. They shot a bomb shell  at Wheeler's Calvary, and it hit near me and buried in the ground.  Wheeler's Calvary came first and ramsaked the place. They got all the  valuables they could, and burned the bridge, the covered bridge over  Cape Fear river, but when the Yankees got there they had a pontoon  bridge to cross on,--all those provision wagons and such. When they  passed our place it was in the morning. They nearly scared me to death.  They passed right by our door, Sherman's army. They began passing, so  the white folks said, at 9 o'clock in the mornin'. At 9 o'clock at night  they were passin' our door on foot. They said there were two hundred and  fifty thousan' o' them passed. Some camped in my marster's old fiel'. A  Yankee caught one of my marster's shoats and cut off one of the hind  quarters, gave it to me, and told me to carry and give it to my mother.  I was so small I could not tote it, so I drug it to her. I called her  when I got in hollering distance of the house and she came and got it.  The Yankees called us Johnnie, Dinah, Bill and other funny names. They  beat their drums and sang songs. One of the Yankees sang 'Rock a Bye  Baby'. At that time Jeff Davis money was plentiful. My mother had about  $1000. It was so plentiful it was called Jeff Davis shucks. My mother  had bought a pair of shoes, and had put them in a chest. A Yankee came  and took the shoes and wore them off, leaving his in their place. They  tol' us we were free. Sometimes the marster would get cruel to the  slaves if they acted like they were free.    Mat Holmes, a slave, was wearing a ball and chain as a punishment for  running away. Marster Ezekial King put it on him. He has slept in the  bed with me, wearing that ball and chain. The cuff had embedded in his  leg, it was swollen so. This was right after the Yankees came through.  It was March, the 9th of March, when the Yankees came through. Mat  Holmes had run away with the ball and chain on him and was in the woods  then. He hid out staying with us at night until August. Then my mother  took him to the Yankee garrison at Fayetteville. A Yankee officer then  took him to a black smith shop and had the ball and chain cut off his  leg. The marsters would tell the slaves to go to work that they were not  free, that they still belonged to them, but one would drop out and  leave, then another. There was little work done on the farm, and  finally most of the slaves learned they were free.    Abraham Lincoln was one of the greatest men that ever lived. He was the  cause of us slaves being free. No doubt about that. I didn't think  anything of Jeff Davis. He tried to keep us in slavery. I think slavery  was an injustice, not right. Our privilege is to live right, and live  according to the teachings of the Bible, to treat our fellowman right.  To do this I feel we should belong to some religious organization and  live as near right as we know how.    The overseers and patterollers in the time of slavery were called poor  white trash by the slaves.    On the plantations not every one, but some of the slave holders would  have some certain slave women reserved for their own use. Sometimes  children almost white would be born to them. I have seen many of these  children. Sometimes the child would be said to belong to the overseer,  and sometimes it would be said to belong to the marster.          N. C.

Being informed that Laura Bell was an old slavery Negro, I went  immediately to the little two-room shack with its fallen roof and shaky  steps. As I approached the shack I noticed that the storm had done great  damage to the chaney-berry tree in her yard, fallen limbs litterin' the  ground, which was an inch deep in garbage and water.    The porch was littered with old planks and huge tubs and barrels of  stagnant water. There was only room for one chair and in that sat a tall  Negro woman clad in burlap bags and in her lap she held a small white  flea-bitten dog which growled meaningly.    When I reached the gate, which swings on one rusty hinge, she bade me  come in and the Carolina Power and Light Company men, who were at work  nearby, laughed as I climbed over the limbs and garbage and finally  found room for one foot on the porch and one on the ground.    \"I wus borned in Mount Airy de year 'fore de Yankees come, bein' de  fourth of five chilluns.

Thereby she also took a step that helped to break down provincial  antagonisms. When in 1689 Massachusetts and Connecticut sent agents to  Albany to join with New York in making presents to the Indians of that  colony in order to engage their aid against the French,[52:3] they  recognized (as their leaders put it) that Albany was \"the hinge\" of the  frontier in this exposed quarter. In thanking Connecticut for the  assistance furnished in 1690 Livingston said: \"I hope your honors do not  look upon Albany as Albany, but as the frontier of your honor's Colony  and of all their Majesties countries.\"[52:4]    The very essence of the American frontier is that it is the graphic line  which records the expansive energies of the people behind it, and which  by the law of its own being continually draws that advance after it to  new conquests. This is one of the most significant things about New  England's frontier in these years. That long blood-stained line of the  eastern frontier which skirted the Maine coast was of great importance,  for it imparted a western tone to the life and characteristics of the  Maine people which endures to this day, and it was one line of advance  for New England toward the mouth of the St. Lawrence, leading again and  again to diplomatic negotiations with the powers that held that river.  The line of the towns that occupied the waters of the Merrimac, tempted  the province continually into the wilderness of New Hampshire. The  Connecticut river towns pressed steadily up that stream, along its  tributaries into the Hoosatonic valleys, and into the valleys between  the Green Mountains of Vermont. By the end of 1723, the General Court of  Massachusetts enacted,--         That It will be of Great Service to all the Western Frontiers,       both in this and the Neighboring Government of Conn., to Build       a Block House above Northfield, in the most convenient Place       on the Lands called the Equivilant Lands, & to post in it       forty Able Men, English & Western Indians, to be employed in       Scouting at a Good Distance up Conn. River, West River, Otter       Creek, and sometimes Eastwardly above the Great Manadnuck, for       the Discovery of the Enemy Coming towards anny of the frontier       Towns.[53:1]    The \"frontier Towns\" were preparing to swarm. It was not long before  Fort Dummer replaced \"the Block House,\" and the Berkshires and Vermont  became new frontiers.    The Hudson River likewise was recognized as another line of advance  pointing the way to Lake Champlain and Montreal, calling out demands  that protection should be secured by means of an aggressive advance of  the frontier. _Canada delenda est_ became the rallying cry in New  England as well as in New York, and combined diplomatic pressure and  military expeditions followed in the French and Indian wars and in the  Revolution, in which the children of the Connecticut and Massachusetts  frontier towns, acclimated to Indian fighting, followed Ethan Allen and  his fellows to the north.[54:1]    Having touched upon some of the military and expansive tendencies of  this first official frontier, let us next turn to its social, economic,  and political aspects. How far was this first frontier a field for the  investment of eastern capital and for political control by it? Were  there evidences of antagonism between the frontier and the settled,  property-holding classes of the coast? Restless democracy, resentfulness  over taxation and control, and recriminations between the Western  pioneer and the Eastern capitalist, have been characteristic features of  other frontiers: were similar phenomena in evidence here? Did  \"Populistic\" tendencies appear in this frontier, and were there  grievances which explained these tendencies?[54:2]    In such colonies as New York and Virginia the land grants were often  made to members of the Council and their influential friends, even when  there were actual settlers already on the grants. In the case of New  England the land system is usually so described as to give the  impression that it was based on a non-commercial policy, creating new  Puritan towns by free grants of land made in advance to approved  settlers. This description does not completely fit the case. That there  was an economic interest on the part of absentee proprietors, and that  men of political influence with the government were often among the  grantees seems also to be true. Melville Egleston states the case thus:  \"The court was careful not to authorize new plantations unless they were  to be in a measure under the influence of men in whom confidence could  be placed, and commonly acted upon their application.\"[55:1] The  frontier, as we shall observe later, was not always disposed to see the  practice in so favorable a light.    New towns seem to have been the result in some cases of the aggregation  of settlers upon and about a large private grant; more often they  resulted from settlers in older towns, where the town limits were  extensive, spreading out to the good lands of the outskirts, beyond easy  access to the meeting-house, and then asking recognition as a separate  town. In some cases they may have been due to squatting on unassigned  lands, or purchasing the Indian title and then asking confirmation. In  others grants were made in advance of settlement.    As early as 1636 the General Court had ordered that none go to new  plantations without leave of a majority of the magistrates.[55:2] This  made the legal situation clear, but it would be dangerous to conclude  that it represented the actual situation. In any case there would be a  necessity for the settlers finally to secure the assent of the Court.  This could be facilitated by a grant to leading men having political  influence with the magistrates. The complaints of absentee proprietors  which find expression in the frontier petitions of the seventeenth and  early eighteenth century seems to indicate that this happened. In the  succeeding years of the eighteenth century the grants to leading men and  the economic and political motives in the grants are increasingly  evident. This whole topic should be made the subject of special study.  What is here offered is merely suggestive of a problem.[56:1]    The frontier settlers criticized the absentee proprietors, who profited  by the pioneers' expenditure of labor and blood upon their farms, while  they themselves enjoyed security in an eastern town. A few examples from  town historians will illustrate this. Among the towns of the Merrimac  Valley, Salisbury was planted on the basis of a grant to a dozen  proprietors including such men as Mr. Bradstreet and the younger Dudley,  only two of whom actually lived and died in Salisbury.[56:2] Amesbury  was set off from Salisbury by division, one half of the signers of the  agreement signing by mark. Haverhill was first seated in 1641, following  petitions from Mr. Ward, the Ipswich minister, his son-in-law, Giles  Firmin, and others. Firmin's letter to Governor Winthrop, in 1640,  complains that Ipswich had given him his ground in that town on  condition that he should stay in the town three years or else he could  not sell it, \"whenas others have no business but range from place to  place on purpose to live upon the countrey.\"[56:3]    Dunstable's large grant was brought about by a combination of leading  men who had received grants after the survey of 1652; among such grants  was one to the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company and another to  Thomas Brattle of Boston. Apparently it was settled chiefly by others  than the original grantees.[57:1] Groton voted in 1685 to sue the  \"non-Residenc\" to assist in paying the rate, and in 1679 the General  Court had ordered non-residents having land at Groton to pay rates for  their lands as residents did.[57:2] Lancaster (Nashaway) was granted to  proprietors including various craftsmen in iron, indicating, perhaps, an  expectation of iron works, and few of the original proprietors actually  settled in the town.[57:3] The grant of 1653-4 was made by the Court  after reciting: (1) that it had ordered in 1647 that the \"ordering and  disposeing of the Plantation at Nashaway is wholly in the Courts power\";  (2) \"Considering that there is allredy at Nashaway about nine Families  and that severall both freemen and others intend to goe and setle there,  some whereof are named in this Petition,\" etc.    Mendon, begun in 1660 by Braintree people, is a particularly significant  example. In 1681 the inhabitants petitioned that while they are not \"of  the number of those who dwell in their ceiled houses & yet say the time  is not come that the Lord's house should be built,\" yet they have gone  outside of their strength \"unless others who are proprietors as well as  ourselves, (the price of whose lands is much raysed by our carrying on  public work & will be nothing worth if we are forced to quit the place)  doo beare an equal share in Town charges with us. Those who are not yet  come up to us are a great and far yet abler part of our  Proprietors . . .\"[57:4] In 1684 the selectmen inform the General Court  that one half of the proprietors, two only excepted, are dwelling in  other places, \"Our proprietors, abroad,\" say they, \"object that they see  no reason why they should pay as much for thayer lands as we do for our  Land and stock, which we answer that if their be not a noff of reason  for it, we are sure there is more than enough of necessity to supply  that is wanting in reason.\"[58:1] This is the authentic voice of the  frontier.    Deerfield furnishes another type, inasmuch as a considerable part of its  land was "]]]
