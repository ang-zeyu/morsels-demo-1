West and I have  settled it all most comfortably, patted each other on the head, and so  forth. Let you go? Why, he'd like nothing better than to let you go for  good and all!\"    \"So you've let the whole lot of us in for it, young man?\" said  Trevelyan, looking amused.    \"Why, nobody asked to be left out,\" returned Jack.    This was quite true, and there was no more to be said. Hallett had taken  kindly to the idea to begin with, and set the fashion by doing so. One  or two lazy lads would not have been sorry in their hearts if Mr. West  had vetoed the scheme, but they had not the courage to refuse to join in  it.    \"Now to business!\" Jack continued. \"We must send Mr. Thompson himself  word of our intentions; let's write a proper, tradesman-like letter!  Vickers, you're the fluent, flowery one. Bottle up your metaphors and  give us a page of business-like fluency! Here's some paper.\"    After a good deal of discussion the following letter was composed:--         _To Mr J. Thompson Nurseryman._         _Dr Sir/_         _Having heard of yr intention to dispose of yr stock-in-hand       (Plants) we have pleasure in proposing to undertake transport of       same (carriage free) on Saty next ensuing between 2 and 4 p.m. from       yr house to Rookwood Elmridge Middleshire for sale advd to be held       there at 6 p.m. Safety of goods guarantd. Unless we hear to contry       we shall presume this meets yr views and take action accordly._         _Yrs etc._             _(Signed) T. Vickers_                    _N. Hallett_                    _J. Brady &c._       _pro) Students of Brincliffe Elmridge._    \"If that isn't business-like, I don't know what is!\" exclaimed Cadbury,  when it was read through. \"If ink was a shilling a drop, you couldn't  have been more chary of it. There's not an 'a', 'an', or 'the'  throughout, nor a comma, nor an adjective, and the contractions are  masterly. We're all born commercial clerks, that's what we are!\"    \"Ethel and Lucy have undertaken the necessary barrow-borrowing,\"  remarked Jack, casually. \"We sha'n't want more than six or eight  wheel-barrows, and that pair can get anything if it goes together. Lucy  represents the dauntless cheek, and Ethel the irresistible charm. What  more is required?\"    \"What do you mean, Brady? We won't have the day-boys sticking their  fingers into this pie!\" cried Escombe Trevelyan.    \"We couldn't do the job alone,\" said Jack quietly. \"It would take us  twice as long.\"    A loud murmur of disapprobation ran through the room.    Jack turned rather pale, and pinched the edge of the table nervously.  His eyes wandered from face to face. All were vexed, all displeased.  Then, with a sudden impulse he sprang to his feet, and spoke his  mind--rapidly, earnestly.    \"Look here, I can't understand it! What makes you all so beastly  to the day-boys--to my pals? You began it, not they! They came to  Brincliffe without the least idea of any unfriendly feeling, and you  hated them before you'd seen them or heard their names. Is that  fair--straight--English? If it were, I'd wish to be French or German.  Where's the fun in this constant worrying of each other? As boarders,  it's your place to put out a hand first, and I think I can promise that  the day-boys will shake it. Bah! I know I can never talk you round; it's  no good attempting to. I'm not in a comic mood, and can't make you  laugh, like Cadbury, and I haven't Vickers's gift of the gab. But wasn't  last Friday's lesson enough? Wasn't the sight of that knife--\"    [Illustration]    \"Hush!\" came from many mouths.    \"Oh, we want to forget it! Yes, we don't want to talk about it, I know.  But I've got to this once. If there had been an accident--to  Armitage--it wouldn't have been wholly the March Hare's fault. It was  those who first started the quarrel between boarders and day-boys, those  who put the notion of ill-feeling into his silly little head. I see  you're thinking of the swimming-baths, and Toppin's dive. Now I happen  to know, and Toppin can bear me out, that the kid asked to be pushed,  and that Armitage would have saved him next moment if the March Hare  hadn't jumped in and hindered things. And everyone of you who have  listened and nodded to the March Hare's tale have added coal to the fire  you might have quenched in a moment. And--and--and--and--\" poor Jack was  shaking and stammering with excitement, \"what--what if it had--ended  in--\"    But there he sat down, leaving his sentence unfinished.    Cadbury was the first to reply, and that was not at once. Slowly he  ruled a long, thick, black line in his exercise-book, then, pushing his  chair away from the table, tilted it back, and spoke:    \"Well, I don't know what anyone else thinks, but I'll tell you what I  do. Brady's last sentence was certainly not fluent, and I shouldn't  care to have to analyse it. As for the jokes in it, they were about as  plentiful as wasps in January. All that's true enough. Still,  nevertheless, speaking for my humble self, he thrust home. You did,  Jack, you beggar! You'd no business to, but you actually had the  impudence to make me feel ashamed of myself. And, of course, I don't  know what you others will say, but I vote we bury the hatchet in old  Thompson's biggest flower-pot. Who's with me?\"    \"I am!\"    \"I am!\"    \"And I!\"    \"Of course it's quite right to forgive,\" drawled Green, with a curl of  the lip. \"I'm more than willing.\"    Jack ground his teeth, but Hallett saved him the trouble of replying.    \"No, no; if we do the thing at all, we'll do it properly. Don't let's  have any half-measures--kindly-forgivings, and all the rest of it! If  anyone starts forgiving me, I'll lick him! We won't forgive anyone, not  even ourselves. We'll go straight ahead on a new tack, and forget  everything that's happened. If our friends the enemy look askance at us  at first (and we needn't be surprised if they do), that mustn't affect  us. Remember this: Scores are Settled. That's our motto; there is to be  no more paying off. Chaff them if you like--I fancy they'd think there  was something fishy if we didn't--but no tricks, if you please.\"    \"What if they start them on us, Hallett?\" enquired Grey, in the tone of  one who merely seeks information. Hallett frowned slightly.    \"Hadn't thought of that. Of course if they insist on picking a quarrel  in that way--\"    \"But I'm nearly sure they won't,\" cried Jack.    \"I caught Lucy pasting the leaves of my _Delectus_ together,\" murmured  Grey, looking at the ceiling.    \"And how many things have you done to them?\" retorted Jack desperately,  sighing as he felt the weakness of that argument.    \"Vick, will you hand Grey your india-rubber?\" put in Cadbury. \"There's a  bit of his memory he hasn't rubbed out yet. I did as Hallett told us,  and forgot everything at once. I've even forgotten my translation for  to-morrow--it's gone entirely. Never mind: to obey is our first duty; to  labour for Peace comes only second.\"    \"Labouring for peace--why, Brady, that's been your little task!\"  exclaimed Vickers. \"And a noble one\"--here he put on the \"West voice\".  \"Have you thought of it in that light, my boy? To labour for peace! We  might all do worse. Conceive, for instance, of working for love!\"    Jack laughed noisily, and called Vickers \"a silly old loony\". But he  blushed at the same time. And he went to sleep that night feeling  uncommonly hopeful.    When, in short jerky phrases, he broke to Hannah the plan he had  devised, the maid was so grateful and \"took aback\", as she said, as to  become for the moment half-hysterical; but soon rallying her common  sense, she sat down and penned a note to her father, to accompany the  young gentlemen's communication. Hannah's spelling, handwriting, and  grammar were all very shaky, but it is a fact that Mr. J. Thompson,  Nurseryman, found her letter a help in throwing light upon the \"formal,  business\" document.          CHAPTER IX    LOST--A NAME      Of course Jack's task was only half accomplished. And the second half  was somewhat harder than he had anticipated. When in the morning he met  the day-scholars, they were not as eager for a reconciliation as he  would have liked to find them.    Mason had come armed with a handful of wild barley-grass, or \"crawly\",  as it was better known among the boys.    \"_Dictee_ this morning,\" he said with a sly wink.    In Monsieur Blonde's class, dictation offered great possibilities to a  quick writer, with a supply of crawly. When heads are bent, what a  chance down the collar for a deft hand! And the Monsieur was very  short-sighted.    \"I sit between Vickers and Green,\" Mason added.    \"But look here, you must chuck that stuff away,\" cried Jack. He knew  that as a good-humoured joke an inch of crawly can be tolerated, but  when used in malice, nothing is more irritating. \"Chuck it away! We've  all agreed to call _Pax_ now, _Pax_ for good and all.\"    \"Oh, I dare say!\" retorted Mason. \"When our lives have been made a  burden for the last week! Who are the 'all' who've agreed, pray?\"    \"The whole lot of the boarders. They're ready to chum up right away.  Mason, you must agree! We've got to join forces over Saturday's job.\"    But Mason didn't see it. Nor did Armitage. Nor did Bacon. And the rest  were doubtful, except little Frere, who declared at once that he was  longing to be friends with everybody--and to feel safe.    \"But don't mind us, Brady,\" pursued Mason. \"We aren't so sweet on  shoving wheel-barrows as all that. You and your dear Green and the rest  can have the whole glory and honour of the pots and the barrows to  yourselves. We won't fight for them, will we? After all, there are more  amusing ways of spending a half than in wheeling flower-pots round the  town.\"    Jack's hopes sank. He did not feel equal to making a second speech, but  he caught Mason by the arm, and spoke with vehement"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20386"],[0,"Embroidery and Tapestry Weaving (#11)"],[1,"background, and left exposed for  the pattern, which would probably be a simple repeating form of some  kind. Gobelin stitch is sometimes worked quite perpendicularly just over  two threads in height.    [Illustration: Fig. 81.]    Irish stitch is pretty and quickly worked. It is usually taken  perpendicularly over four threads of the canvas (fig. 82), though the  number over which it is taken may vary. It is worked in such a way as to  make the stitches of each succeeding row fit between those of the last  row, and can be carried out either diagonally or in horizontal lines.  What is known as Florentine work is carried out in a stitch of this  kind. The pattern in this kind of work is taken horizontally across the  ground in a succession of shaded zigzag lines.    [Illustration: Fig. 82.]    Plait stitch is often used for grounding. It resembles a simple plait  laid in close rows to and fro on the ground. It can frequently be seen  used upon the Italian XVIth century linen work, that in which the  pattern is left in plain linen, and the ground worked in some colour.  The diagram in fig. 83 shows the method of working the stitch. If  carried out correctly, the back of the material should show a row of  short perpendicular lines, each composed of two threads.    [Illustration: Fig. 83.]    Two-sided Italian stitch is descriptively named, for it is alike on both  sides. This is frequently seen on XVIth and XVIIth century Italian linen  work, similar to that mentioned above. A loosely woven linen makes a  suitable ground material, for in the working the stitches must be pulled  firmly, so as to draw the threads of the fabric together; this gives  over the ground a squared open-work effect, which is very pretty. Fig.  84 explains the working of the stitch; it is shown in four stages, and  is quite simple; the final result is a cross surrounded by a square. The  lowest figure in the diagram shows the last stage, for the upper side of  the square is filled in when the row above is worked. The drawing  together of the web is not shown, but at a trial it should be done, for  in that lies the special character of the stitch. The silk used must be  just thick enough to well cover the linen, but not too thick, for then  the work would be clumsy.    [Illustration: Fig. 84.]    [Illustration: Fig. 85.]    Holbein stitch (fig. 85), also known as stroke or line stitch, is alike  on both sides, and is often used in conjunction with cross and satin  stitch, as well as alone. Very intricate and interesting patterns can be  devised to be carried out with these three stitches, worked always with  regard to the web of the linen. Squared paper could be used for  planning the design, as the stitches would all be practically of the  same length, and the pattern must be one that can be easily carried out  alike on both sides. The stitch is worked as follows: An even running  stitch, picking up as much material as it leaves, is taken all round the  pattern. This does half the work on either side; the gaps are then  filled up by the running stitch being taken in a contrary direction,  which completes the pattern. Occasionally stitches go off at an angle  from the running pattern; these are completed on the first journey by a  satin stitch being made at the necessary point. The present diagram is a  zigzag line, with one of these stitches going off at each angle. Fig. 86  is an example of a border design carried out in Holbein stitch.    [Illustration: Fig. 86.]    [Illustration: Fig. 87.]    The stitch illustrated in fig. 87 is known as rococo stitch. It is a  useful one for carrying out a conventional design, such as, to give a  simple illustration, a flower sprig repeating in the spaces formed by a  trellis pattern. The effect of the stitch when worked cannot be judged  from this diagram; to see this properly a piece of canvas must be worked  entirely over with it. The pattern chosen is usually one that lends  itself to being worked in diagonal lines, as this stitch is best worked  in that way. It entirely hides the canvas background, and is carried out  very similarly to the oriental stitch in fig. 71. By the help of that  diagram and description and the present one, which gives various steps,  the worker will easily master the stitch, which is quite simple. The  ordinary carrying out of the stitch is shown where the needle is at  work, and in another part the diagram, by some loosened stitches,  illustrates how to pass from one cluster to the next.    Some fine examples of canvas work design, introducing a variety of  stitches, may be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum. These are large  panels filled with foliage and flowers growing about architectural  columns.[3]    FOOTNOTES:    [2] No. 879, 1904.    [3] No. 517-522, 1896.          CHAPTER VIII    METHODS OF WORK      Couching--Braid Work--Laid Work--Applied Work--Inlaid Work--Patch    Work.      COUCHING    Couching is the name given to a method of embroidery in which one thread  is attached to the material by another one. Sometimes not only one  thread but a number of threads are couched down together; or it may be  cord, braid, or metal thread that is attached to the material in this  way. Fig. 88 shows some couching in progress. The method probably arose  through the difficulty experienced in passing either coarse or very  delicate threads through a material. Couching is constantly in use with  gold thread embroidery, and it is further discussed in the chapter upon  that subject, where also is described an entirely different method,  which is to be recommended for couching other as well as for gold  threads.    [Illustration: Fig. 88.]    Couching is useful in a variety of ways, _e.g._ for carrying out work in  line or for outlining other embroidery, applied work for instance, which  is frequently finished off by means of a couched thread; in the case of  a difficult ground material, it is one of the most manageable methods of  working. The geometrical open fillings of leaves and backgrounds are  often composed of lines of thread thrown across and couched down at  regular intervals. Fig. 89 is an example of a favourite filling of this  kind. Embroidery stitches can be made use of for couching down other  threads; a bunch of threads may be laid upon the material, and an open  chain, buttonhole, or feather stitch worked over in order to fix it in  place.    [Illustration: Fig. 89.]    Braid work is quickly and easily executed; it needs only a suitable  pattern and a pretty braid for couching down to be most successful.  There are a few points to be observed about the technique--the cut edge  of a braid is awkward to manage, for it must, with a special needle, be  taken through to the back of the material and there made secure and  flat; for this reason the design should be so planned as to have as few  breaks as possible. Interlacing strap work designs, of which a simple  example is given in fig. 90, are very suitable for braid work. The  thread that couches down the braid may be quite invisible, or, on the  other hand, it may be made use of to further decorate the braid by being  placed visibly across it, perhaps forming a chequering or other simple  pattern, as shown in fig. 91. Ravellings of the braid may be used as  invisible couching threads for stitching it down. Curves and sharp  corners need special attention by way of extra stitches. The completed  work is much improved by several hours' pressure under a weight.    [Illustration: Fig. 90.]      LAID WORK    [Illustration: Fig. 91.]    Laid work might be described as couching on a more extended scale--a  given space is covered with threads taken from side to side in parallel  lines close together, fixed at either extremity by entering the  material. Further security is usually given by small couching stitches  dotted down at intervals over the laid threads, or by throwing single  lines of thread across in a contrary direction and tying these down at  intervals with couching stitches. Yet another way is, to work a split or  stem stitch over the laid threads, and thus fix them down. Fig. 92 shows  a flower carried out in laid work. The tying-down threads can often be  made use of in one way or another to further decorate, or to explain  form, by means of contrasting colour, change in direction, and so on.  The laid stitches in this flower are taken from the centre outwards and  fixed in place by couched circular lines of thread. The centre of the  flower has a geometrical filling, composed of a couched lattice pattern  with French knots between. Conventional centres of this and like kinds  are very pretty for embroidery flowers; such patterns as those shown in  fig. 93 can often be seen in use, and they need only a trial to be  frequently adopted.    [Illustration: Fig. 92.]    [Illustration: Fig. 93.]    Laid work shows off the gloss and texture of silk to great advantage,  which is due to the thread being laid upon the material without being  cut up into small stitches. Floss silk is much used for the work; it  must not be at all twisted in the laying down, since this mars the  effect. The work is carried out in a frame; it is quickly executed and  economical, the thread being practically all upon the surface. Owing to  the length of the stitches, this is not a very durable method, so it  should not be subjected to hard wear. The work has sometimes a flimsy,  unsatisfactory appearance, probably because of these long stitches. It  will be seen that the silk passing through to the back, and then  immediately to the front again, takes up very little of the material. A  method in use for giving greater strength in this way is to lay the silk  first in alternate lines and to fill up the gaps thus left upon a  second journey across the form. For added strength, use might be made of  a linen thread at the back, as in the _point couche rentre ou retire_  method that is discussed later.    [Illustration: Fig. 94.]    A"]]]
