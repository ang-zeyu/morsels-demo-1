Much of the diplomatic work of the  previous reign had passed through his hands; he helped to arrange the  marriage of Arthur and Catherine, and was employed in the vain attempt  to obtain Margaret of Savoy as a bride for Henry VII. As Archbishop he  crowned and married Henry VIII., and as Chancellor he delivered  orations at the opening of the young King's first three Parliaments.[89]  They are said to have given general satisfaction, but apart from them,  Warham, for some unknown reason, took little part in political  business. So far as Henry can be said at this time to have had a Prime  Minister, that title belongs to Fox, his Lord Privy Seal and Bishop of  Winchester. Fox had been even more active than Warham in politics, and  more closely linked with the personal fortunes of the two Tudor kings.  He had shared the exile of Henry of Richmond; the treaty of Etaples,  the Intercursus Magnus, the marriage of Henry's elder daughter to  James IV., and the betrothal of his younger to Charles, were largely  the work of his hands. Malicious gossip described him as willing to  consent to his own father's death to serve the turn of his king,   (p. 049)  and a better founded belief ascribed to his wit the invention of  \"Morton's fork\".[90] He was Chancellor of Cambridge in 1500, as Warham  was of Oxford, but won more enduring fame by founding the college of  Corpus Christi in the university over which the Archbishop presided.  He had baptised Henry VIII. and advocated his marriage to Catherine;  and to him the King extended the largest share in his confidence.  Badoer, the Venetian ambassador, called him \"alter rex,\"[91] and  Carroz, the Spaniard, said Henry trusted him most; but Henry was not  blind to the failings of his most intimate councillors, and he warned  Carroz that the Bishop of Winchester was, as his name implied, a fox  indeed.[92] A third prelate, Ruthal of Durham, divided with Fox the  chief business of State; and these clerical advisers were supposed to  be eager to guide Henry's footsteps in the paths of peace, and  counteract the more adventurous tendencies of their lay colleagues.                       [Footnote 89: _L. and P._, i., 811, 2082; ii.,                     114.]                       [Footnote 90: _D.N.B._, xx., 152.]                       [Footnote 91: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 63.]                       [Footnote 92: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 44.]    At the head of the latter stood Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, soon to  be rewarded for his victory at Flodden by his restoration to the  dukedom of Norfolk. He and his son, the third duke, were Lord High  Treasurers throughout Henry's reign; but jealousy of their past, Tudor  distrust of their rank, or personal limitations, impaired the  authority that would otherwise have attached to their official  position; and Henry never trusted them as he did ministers whom he  himself had raised from the dust. Surrey had served under Edward IV.  and Richard III.; he had fought against Henry at Bosworth, been  attainted and sent to the Tower. Reflecting that it was better to  (p. 050)  be a Tudor official at Court than a baronial magnate in prison, he  submitted to the King and was set up as a beacon to draw his peers  from their feudal ways. The rest of the council were men of little  distinction. Shrewsbury, the Lord High Steward, was a pale reflex of  Surrey, and illustrious in nought but descent. Charles Somerset, Lord  Herbert, who was Chamberlain and afterwards Earl of Worcester, was a  Beaufort bastard,[93] and may have derived some little influence from  his harmless kinship with Henry VIII. Lovell, the Treasurer, Poynings  the Controller of the Household, and Harry Marney, Chancellor of the  Duchy of Lancaster, were tried and trusty officials. Bishop Fisher was  great as a Churchman, a scholar, a patron of learning, but not as a  man of affairs; while Buckingham, the only duke in England, and his  brother, the Earl of Wiltshire, were rigidly excluded by dynastic  jealousy from all share in political authority.                       [Footnote 93: He is a link in the hereditary chain                     which began with Beauforts, Dukes of Somerset and                     ended in Somersets, Dukes of Beaufort.]    The most persistent of Henry's advisers was none of his council. He  was Ferdinand the Catholic, King of Aragon; and to his inspiration has  been ascribed[94] the course of foreign policy during the first five  years of his son-in-law's reign. He worked through his daughter; the  only thing she valued in life, wrote Catherine a month after her  marriage, was her father's confidence. When Membrilla was recalled  because he failed to satisfy Catherine's somewhat exacting temper, she  was herself formally commissioned to act in his place as           (p. 051)  Ferdinand's ambassador at Henry's Court; Henry was begged to give her  implicit credence and communicate with Spain through her mediation!  \"These kingdoms of _your_ highness,\" she wrote to her father, \"are in  great tranquillity.\"[95] Well might Ferdinand congratulate himself on  the result of her marriage, and the addition of fresh, to his already  extensive, domains. He needed them all to ensure the success of his  far-reaching schemes. His eldest grandson, Charles, was heir not only  to Castile and Aragon, Naples and the Indies, which were to come to  him from his mother, Ferdinand's imbecile daughter, Juana, but to  Burgundy and Austria, the lands of his father, Philip, and of Philip's  father, the Emperor Maximilian. This did not satisfy Ferdinand's  grasping ambition; he sought to carve out for his second grandson,  named after himself, a kingdom in Northern Italy.[96] On the Duchy of  Milan, the republics of Venice, Genoa and Florence, his greedy eyes  were fixed. Once conquered, they would bar the path of France to  Naples; compensated by these possessions, the younger Ferdinand might  resign his share in the Austrian inheritance to Charles; while Charles  himself was to marry the only daughter of the King of Hungary, add  that to his other dominions, and revive the empire of Charlemagne. (p. 052)  Partly with these objects in view, partly to draw off the scent from  his own track, Ferdinand had, in 1508, raised the hue and cry after  Venice. Pope and Emperor, France and Spain, joined in the chase, but  of all the parties to the league of Cambrai, Louis XII. was in a position  to profit the most. His victory over Venice at Agnadello (14th May,  1509), secured him Milan and Venetian territory as far as the Mincio;  it also dimmed the prospects of Ferdinand's Italian scheme and threatened  his hold on Naples; but the Spanish King was restrained from open  opposition to France by the fact that Louis was still mediating  between him and Maximilian on their claims to the administration of  Castile, the realm of their daughter and daughter-in-law, Juana.

The young King entered the arena of Europe, a child  of generous impulse in a throng of hoary intriguers--Ferdinand,  Maximilian, Louis XII., Julius II.--each of whom was nearly three  times his age. He was shocked to see them leagued to spoil a petty  republic, a republic, too, which had been for ages the bulwark of  Christendom against the Turk and from time immemorial the ally of  England. Venice had played no small part in the revival of letters  which appealed so strongly to Henry's intellectual sympathies. Scholars  and physicians from Venice, or from equally threatened Italian  republics, frequented his Court and Cabinet. Venetian merchants  developed the commerce of London; Venetian galleys called twice a year  at Southampton on their way to and from Flanders, and their trade  (p. 053)  was a source of profit to both nations. Inevitably Henry's sympathies  went out to the sore-pressed republic. They were none the less strong  because the chief of the spoilers was France, for Henry and his people  were imbued with an inborn antipathy to everything French.[97] Before  he came to the throne he was reported to be France's enemy; and  speculations were rife as to the chances of his invading it and  imitating the exploits of his ancestor Henry V. It needed no  persuasion from Ferdinand to induce him to intervene in favour of  Venice. Within a few weeks of his accession he refused to publish the  papal bull which cast the halo of crusaders over the bandits of  Cambrai.

Go ask John Sobieski!    The woes of Poland have produced strange men. Under such rule as she has  known relentless hate springs up in otherwise gracious hearts from the  scattered dragons' teeth; and in other natures, where there is not quite  so much of the motive temperament, a deep strain of sorrow and religious  melancholy finds expression. The exquisite sensibility, delicate  insight, proud reserve and brooding world-sorrow of Frederic Chopin were  the inheritance of mother to son. This mother's mind was saturated with  the wrongs her people had endured: she herself had suffered every  contumely, for where chance had caused fact to falter, imagination had  filled the void.    It is easy to say that Chopin's was an abnormal nature, and of course it  was, but when disease divides this world from another only by the  thinnest veil, the mind has been known to see things with a clearness  and vividness never before attained. With Chopin the strands of life  were often taut to the breaking-point, but ere they snapped, their  vibration gave forth to us some exquisite harmonies.    Curiously enough, this power to see and do is often the possession of  dying men. The life flares up in a flame before it goes out forever. The  passion of the consumptive Camille, as portrayed by Dumas, is  typical--no healthy woman ever loved with that same intense, eager and  almost vindictive desire. It was a race with Death.    Perfect health brings unconsciousness of body, and disease that almost  relieves the spirit of this weight of flesh produces the same results.  Again we have the Law of Antithesis.    That such a youth as Frederic Chopin should seek in music a surcease  from his world-sorrow is very natural. A stricken people turns to music;  it forms a necessary part of all religious observance, and the dirge of  mourners, the wail of the \"keener,\" and the songs of the banshee evolve  naturally into being wherever the heart is sore oppressed. It was the  slave-songs that made slavery bearable; and in the long ago, exiles in  Babylon found a solemn joy by singing the songs of Zion. Chopin drank in  the songs of Poland with his mother's milk, and while yet a child began  to give them voice in his own way.    In the meantime his father's fortunes had mended a bit, and the family  had moved to Warsaw, where Nicholas Chopin was Professor of Languages at  the Lyceum. The title of the office fills the mouth in a very satisfying  way, but the emoluments attached hardly afforded such a gratification.    In Warsaw there was much misery, for the plunderer had worked  conscription and seizure to its furthest limit. Want and destitution  were on every hand, but still this brave people maintained their  University and clung to its traditions. The family of the Professor of  Languages consisted of himself, wife, three daughters and the son  Frederic. Their income for several years was not over fifteen dollars a  month, but still they managed to maintain an appearance of decency, and  by the help of the public library, the free museum and the open-air  concerts, they kept abreast of the times in literature, art and music.    There was absolute economy required, every particle of food was saved,  and when cast-off dresses were sent from the home of the Count it was a  godsend for the mother and girls, who measured and patched and pieced,  making garments for themselves, and for Frederic as well; so while their  raiment was not gaudy nor expressed in fancy, it served.    Chopin once said to George Sand, \"I never can think of my mother without  her knitting-needles!\" And George Sand has recorded, \"Frederic never had  but one passion and that was his mother.\" Into all of her knitting this  mother's flying needles worked much love. The entire household was one  of mutual service, and gentle, trusting affection. The weekly letters of  Chopin to his mother from Paris, and the cold sweat on his forehead at  the thought of his parents knowing of his relationship with George Sand,  are credit-marks to his character. There is a sweet recompense in mutual  deprivation where trials and difficulties only serve to cement the  affections; and who shall say how much the wondrous blending of strength  and delicacy in the music of Chopin is due to the memory of those early  days of toil and trial, of strength and forbearance, of hope and love?    To be born into such a family is a great blessing. The value of the  environment is shown in that all three of the sisters became  distinguished in literature. Two of them married men of intellect,  wealth and worth, and through the collaboration of these sisters, books  were produced that did for the plain people of Poland what Harriet  Martineau's books on sociology did for the people of England. Frederic  played and practised at the Lyceum where his father taught, and the  ambition of his parents was that he should grow up and take the place of  Professor of Music in the Lyceum. Adalbert Zevyny, one of the leading  pianists in the city, became attracted to the boy and took him as a  pupil, without pay.    The teacher soon became a little boastful of his precocious pupil, and  when there came a public concert for the benefit of the poor, we find  reference made to Chopin thus, \"A child not yet eight years of age  played, and connoisseurs say he promises to replace Mozart.\" In reality  the boy was nearer twelve than eight, but his size and looks suggested  to the management the idea of plagiarizing, in advance, our honored  countryman, Phineas T. Barnum. Hence the announcement on the programs.    But now the nobility of the neighborhood began to send carriages for the  fair-haired lad, so he could play for their invited guests. Then came  snug little honorariums that soon replaced his patched-up wardrobe for  something more fashionable.    Frederic took all the applause quite as a matter of course, and on one  occasion, after he had played divinely, he asked a proud lady this  question, \"How do you like my new collar?\"    He was to the manner born, and the gentle blood of his mother formed him  as a fit companion for aristocrats.    These occasional musicales at the houses of the great made money matters  easier, and Frederic began to take lessons from Joseph Elsner, who  taught him the science of composition, and introduced him into the  deeper mysteries of music-making. Elsner, it was, more than any other  man, who forced the truth upon Chopin that he must play to satisfy  himself, and in composition be his own most exacting critic. In other  words, Elsner developed and strengthened in Chopin the artistic  conscience--that impulse which causes an artist to scorn doing anything  save his best.    From little excursions to neighboring towns and country houses about  Warsaw, Chopin now ventured farther away from home, chaperoned by his  friend, Prince Radziwill. He visited Berlin, Venice, Prague, Heidelberg,  and mingled on an absolute equality with the nobility. If they had  titles, he had talents. And his talents often made their decorations  sing small.    His modesty was witching, and while in public concerts his playing was  not pronounced enough to capture the gallery, yet in small gatherings he  won all hearts, and the fact that he played his own compositions made  him an added object of enthusiasm to the elect. Chopin arrived in Paris  when he was twenty-two years of age. It was not his intention to remain  more than a few weeks, but Paris was to be his home for eighteen  years--and then Pere la Chaise.           *       *       *       *       *    A woman who beholds her thirtieth birthday in sight, and girlhood gone,  is approaching a climacteric in her career. Flaubert has named  twenty-nine as the eventful year in the life of woman, and thirty-three  for men. Every normal woman craves love and tenderness--these are her  God-given right. If they have not come to her by the time the bloom is  fading from her cheeks, there is danger of her reaching out and  clutching for them. The strongest instinct in young girls is  self-protection--they fight on the defensive. But at thirty, women have  been known to grow a trifle anxious, just as did the Sabine women who  dispatched a messenger to the Romans asking this question, \"How soon  does the program begin?\"    And thus are conditions reversed, for it is the youth of twenty or so  who seeks conquest with fiery soul. Alexander was only nineteen when he  sighed for more worlds to conquer. He didn't have to wait long before he  found that this one had conquered him. Youth considers itself immortal,  and its powers without limit, but as a man approaches thirty he grows  economical of his resources and parsimonious of his emotions. Men of  thirty, or so, are apt to be coy.    And so one might say that it is around thirty that for the first time  the man and the woman meet on an equality, without sham, shame or  pretense. Before that time the average woman abounds in affectation and  untruth; the man is absurdly aggressive and full of foolish flattery.    As to the question, \"Should women propose?\" the answer is, \"Yes,  certainly, and they do when they are twenty-nine.\"    Aurora Dudevant saw her thirtieth birthday looming on the horizon of her  life. Nine years before she had been married to an ex-army-officer, who  dyed his whiskers purple. Aurora had been a dutiful wife, intent for the  first few years on filling her husband's heart and home with joy. She  had failed in this, and the proof of failure lay in that he much  preferred his dogs, guns and horses to her society. For days he would  absent himself on his hunting excursions, and at home he did not have  the tact to hide the fact that he was awfully bored.    Thackeray, once for all, has given us a picture of the heavy dragoon  with a soul for dogs--one to whom all music, save the bay of a  fox-hound, makes its"]]]
