The indications are that both these inclosures were  originally one story in height, forming a wing to the central section  of the ruin, which had an additional tier of rooms. There is an  entrance to _F_ at the extreme left, and the whole room was lower than  the floor of the lower stories of _B_, _C_, and _D_.    The most conspicuous pictograph on the cliff above Ruin I of Palatki,  is a circular white figure, seen in the accompanying illustration.  This pictograph is situated directly above the first room on the  right, _A_, and was apparently made with chalk, so elevated that at  present it is far above the reach of a person standing on any of the  walls. From its general character I am led to believe that it was made  by the Apache and not by the builders of the pueblo.    There were no names of white visitors anywhere on the walls of  Palatki, which, so far as it goes, affords substantial support of my  belief that we were the first white men to visit this ruin. While it  can not be positively asserted that we were the original discoverers  of this interesting building, there is no doubt that I was the first  to describe it and to call attention to its highly characteristic  architectural plan.    The walls of Palatki are not so massive as those of the neighboring  Honanki, and the number of rooms in both ruins which form Palatki is  much smaller. Each of these components probably housed not more than a  few families, while several phratries could readily be accommodated in  Honanki.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XCIX    PALATKI (RUIN I)]    The second Palatki ruin is well preserved, and as a rule the rooms,  especially those in front, have suffered more from vandalism and from  the elements than have those of Ruin I. The arrangement of the rooms  is somewhat different from that of the more exposed eastern ruin, to  which it undoubtedly formerly belonged.    Ruin II lies in a deep recess or cave, the roof of which forms a  perfect arch above the walls. It is situated a few hundred feet to the  west, and is easily approached by following the fallen debris at the  foot of a perpendicular cliff. The front walls have all fallen,  exposing the rear wall of what was formerly a row of rooms, as shown  in the accompanying illustration (plate CI). There are evidences that  this row of rooms was but a single story in height, while those behind  it have indications of three stories. Ruin II is more hidden by the  trees and by its obscure position in a cavern than the former, but the  masonry in both is of the same general character.    On approaching Ruin II from Ruin I there is first observed a well-made  though rough wall, as a rule intact, along which the line of roof and  flooring can readily be traced (plate CI). In front of this upright  wall are fragments of other walls, some standing in unconnected  sections, others fallen, their fragments extending down the sides of  the talus among the bushes. It was observed that this wall is broken  by an entrance which passes into a chamber, which may be called _A_,  and two square holes are visible, one on each side, above it. These  holes were formerly filled by two logs, which once supported the floor  of a second chamber, the line of which still remains on the upright  wall. The small square orifice directly above the entrance is a  peephole.    In examining the character of the wall it will be noticed that its  masonry is in places rough cast, and that there was little attempt at  regularity in the courses of the component stones, which are neither  dressed nor aligned, although the wall is practically vertical.    At one point, in full view of the observer, a log is apparently  inserted in the wall, and if the surrounding masonry be examined it  will be found that an opening below it had been filled in after the  wall was erected. It is evident, from its position relatively to the  line indicating the roof, that this opening was originally a  passageway from one room to another. Passing back of the standing wall  an inclosure (room _A_) is entered, one side of which is the rock of  the cliff, while the other three bounding walls are built of masonry,  20 feet high. This inclosure was formerly divided into an upper and a  lower room by a partition, which served as the roof of the lower and  the floor of the upper chambers. Two beams stretched across this  inclosure about six feet above the debris of the present floor, and  the openings in the walls, where these beams formerly rested, are  readily observed. In the same way the beam-holes of the upper story  may also be easily seen on the top of the wall. Between the rear wall  of this inclosure and the perpendicular cliff there was a recess which  appears to have been a dark chamber, probably designed for use as a  storage room or granary. The configuration of the cliff, which forms  the major part of the inclosing wall of this chamber, imparts to it an  irregular or roughly triangular form.    The entire central portion of the ruin is very much broken down, and  the floor is strewn to a considerable depth with the debris of fallen  walls. On both sides there are nicely aligned, smoothly finished  walls, with traces of beams on the level of former floors. Some of  these bounding walls are curved; others are straight, and in places  they rise 20 feet. Marks of fire are visible everywhere; most of the  beams have been wrenched from their places, as a result of which the  walls have been much mutilated, badly cracked, or thrown down.    There are no pictographs near this ruin, and no signs of former visits  by white men.    Midway between Honanki and the second Palatki ruin a small ancient  house of the same character as the latter was discovered. This ruin is  very much exposed, and therefore the walls are considerably worn, but  six well-marked inclosures, indicative of former rooms, were readily  made out. No overarching rock shielded this ruin from the elements,  and rubble from fallen walls covers the talus upon which it stands.  The adobe mortar between the stones is much worn, and no fragment of  plastering is traceable within or without. This evidence of the great  weathering of the walls of the ruin is not considered indicative of  greater age than the better preserved ruins in the neighborhood, but  rather of exposure to the action of the elements. Not only are the  walls in a very poor condition, but also the floors show, from the  absence of dry soil upon them, that the whole ruin has suffered  greatly from the same denudation. There are no fragments of pottery  about it, and small objects indicating former habitation are also  wanting. A cedar had taken root where the floor once was, and its  present great size shows considerable age. If any pictographs formerly  existed in the adjacent cliff they have disappeared. There is likewise  no evidence that the Apache had ever sought it for shelter, or if they  had, their occupancy occurred so long ago that time has effaced all  evidence of their presence.      HONANKI    The largest ruin visited in the Red-rock country was called, following  Hopi etymology, Honanki; but the nomenclature was adopted not because  it was so called by the Hopi, but following the rule elsewhere  suggested.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. C    PALATKI (RUIN I)]    This ruin lies under a lofty buttress of rock westward from Lloyd's  canyon, which presented the only available camping place in its  neighborhood. At the time of my visit there was but scanty water in  the canyon and that not potable except for stock. We carried with us  all the water we used, and when this was exhausted were obliged to  retrace our steps to Oak creek. There are groves of trees in the  canyon and evidences that at some seasons there is an abundant water  supply. A corral had been made and a well dug near its mouth, but with  these exceptions there were no evidences of previous occupancy by  white men. We had hardly pitched our camp before tracks of large game  were noticed, and before we left we sighted a bear which had come down  to the water to drink, but which beat a hasty retreat at our approach.  As previously stated, the knowledge of this ruin was communicated to  me by Mr Schuermann.    [Illustration: FIG. 248--Ground plan of Honanki]    The Honanki ruin (figure 248) extends along the base of the cliff for  a considerable distance, and may for convenience of description be  divided into two sections, which, although generally similar, differ  somewhat in structural features. The former is lineal in its  arrangement, and consists of a fringe of houses extending along the  base of the cliff at a somewhat lower level than the other. The walls  of this section were for the greater part broken, and at no place  could anything more than the foundation of the front wall be detected,  although fragments of masonry strewed the sides of the declivity near  its base. The house walls which remain are well-built parallel spurs  constructed at right angles to the cliff, which served as the rear of  all the chambers. At the extreme right end of this row of rooms,  situated deep in a large cavern with overhanging roof, portions of a  rear wall of masonry are well preserved, and the lateral walls of one  or two chambers in this portion of the ruin are still intact.  Straggling along from that point, following the contour of the base of  the cliff under which it lies, there extends a long row of rooms, all  destitute of a front wall.    The first division (plate CII), beginning with the most easterly of  the series, is quite hidden at one end in a deep cavern. At this point  the builders, in order to obtain a good rear wall to their rooms,  constructed a line of masonry parallel with the face of the cliff.

He had no police to support him, no means of putting  pressure on those who should have served his cause. The Conservative  party, with Mr. Kruger at their head, did their best to circumvent  every innovation and to save themselves and the country from what  they believed to be the dangerous inorthodoxy of their President.  Mr. Burgers in his posthumous \"Vindication\" outlines some strange  hints regarding the character of his compatriots, which outlines may  now be readily filled in by personal experience. He therein asserts  that had he chosen to publish to the world a faithful description of  the Transvaal Boers, they would have forfeited the appreciation  gained from the Liberal party in Europe. Mr. Burgers' reserve is  much to be regretted, as a few sidelights thrown on the Boer  character at that period might have helped to educate the Liberal  party of whom he spoke, and thereby saved much of the vacillation of  policy for which the country now has to suffer.    [Illustration: SERGEANT-MAJOR of the 2nd DRAGOONS.    (ROYAL SCOTS GREYS.)    Photo by Gregory & Co., London.]      THE POLITICAL WEB    Before going further, we must examine the situation between the  Governor of the Cape, the President of the South African Republic,  and the Home Government.    When we look back at Boer history, we find the details of annexation  and restoration repeating themselves with the consistency of the  chorus of a nursery rhyme. What the Government of the Cape  accomplished the Government at home proceeded promptly to undo, till  the problems connected with Boer liberty and British rights became  so tangled and so intricate that they could only be solved by the  sword.    It may be remembered that in 1854 Sir George Grey, the then Governor  of the Cape, applied himself to the puzzle. He started with the best  hopes. He saw before him a vista of labour, of argument, of  contradiction, but the tangles, he believed, could eventually be  smoothed out. In the anxiety to avoid trouble and responsibility,  and possibly in an amiable desire to conciliate the parties at home,  the Imperial Government had conceded territories and alienated  subjects without having made an effort to discover the wishes of the  people, or to try a free form of government suited to South Africa.  He was in favour of a Federal Union wherein the separate Colonies  and States, each with its local government and legislature, should  be combined under one general representative legislature, led by a  responsible Ministry, specially charged with the duty of providing  for common defence. This plan of Federal Union seemed to appeal to  the Burghers of the Orange Free State, for the Volksraad decided  that \"a union of alliance with the Cape Colony, either on the plan  of federation or otherwise, is desirable.\" Sir George Grey was not  permitted to pursue his policy, for the British Government decided  against the resumption of British sovereignty over the Orange Free  State. The same forward and backward movement, the same sort of  political _chase et croise_, was again carried on from 1876 and 1877  to 1881. It was decided that a Federal Union should be created  between such African Colonies as were willing to join. To further  this scheme Sir Bartle Frere, after a long and arduous career in  India, was appointed Governor and High Commissioner by Lord  Carnarvon, the then Colonial Secretary. But Sir Bartle was too late.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who had been sent out to the Transvaal on  Special Commission to confer with the President on the question of  Confederation, had already annexed the Transvaal. The reasons for  the annexation were many and excellent. Firstly, the Transvaal  Republic, vulgarly speaking, was out at elbows. It was bankrupt,  helpless, languishing. The sorry sum of 12s. 6d. represented the  entire wealth of the Treasury. The Zulu chief Cetchwayo was waiting  to \"eat up\" the Boers, and the Boers were unceasing in their efforts  to encroach on Zulu territory. But the deplorable state of affairs  is better described by quoting Sir T. Shepstone's letter on the  subject.    \"It was patent to every observer,\" writes Sir T. Shepstone, \"that  the Government (of the Transvaal) was powerless to control either  its white citizens or its native subjects; that it was incapable of  enforcing its laws or of collecting its taxes; that the Treasury was  empty; that the salaries of officials had been and are months in  arrear; that sums payable for the ordinary and necessary expenditure  of government cannot be had, and that such services as postal  contracts were long and hopelessly overdue; that the white  inhabitants had become split into factions; that the large native  populations within the boundaries of the State ignore its authority  and laws; and that the powerful Zulu king, Cetchwayo, is anxious to  seize upon the first opportunity of attacking a country the conduct  of whose warriors has convinced him that it can be easily conquered  by his clamouring regiments.\" He again writes: \"I think it necessary  to explain, more at length than I was able to do in my last  despatch, the circumstances which seem to me to forbid all hope that  the Transvaal Republic is capable of maintaining the show even of  independent existence any longer, which induced me to consider it my  duty to assume this position in my communications with the President  and Executive Council, and which have convinced me that, if I were  to leave the country in its present condition, I should but expose  the inhabitants to anarchy among themselves, and to attack from the  natives, that would prove not only fatal to the Republic, but in the  highest degree dangerous to her Majesty's possessions and subjects  in South Africa.\"    The proclamation of the annexation of the Transvaal was issued on  the 12th of April 1876, and on the previous day Sir T. Shepstone  wrote: \"There will be a protest against my act of annexation issued  by the Government, but they will at the same time call upon the  people to submit quietly, pending the issue. You need not be  disquieted by such action, because it is taken merely to save  appearances, and the members of the Government from the violence of  a faction that seems for years to have held Pretoria in terror when  any act of the Government displeased it. You will better understand  this when I tell you privately that the President has from the first  fully acquiesced in the necessity for the change, and that most of  the members of the Government have expressed themselves anxious for  it--but none of them have had the courage openly to express their  opinions, so I have had to act apparently against them, and this I  felt bound to do, knowing the state and danger of the country, and  that three-fourths of the people will be thankful for the change  when once it is made.\"    As a matter of fact the annexation was received with rejoicing all  over the country. \"God save the Queen\" was sung, and special  thanksgiving services were held in many of the churches. The Union  Jack was run up, the Republican flag hauled down without a  dissentient voice. The arrival of British troops--the first  battalion of the 13th Regiment--was hailed with curiosity and  pleasure, the Boers with their women and children turning out to  meet it and hear the band play. The financial effects of the new  departure were magical. Credit and commerce were at once restored.  Valueless railway bonds rose to par, and the price of landed  property was nearly doubled. On the Queen's birthday, the first  after the annexation, the 24th of May 1877, the native chiefs were  invited to attend, and the Union Jack was formally hoisted to the  strains of the National Anthem. This same flag was within a few  years ignobly hauled down during the signing of the Convention at  Pretoria, and formally buried by a party of Englishmen and loyal  natives. But for the time being all seemed pleased with the new  state of affairs. As Mr. Haggard says, it is difficult to reconcile  the enthusiasm of a great number of the inhabitants of the Transvaal  for English rule and the quiet acquiescence of the remainder at this  time, with the decidedly antagonistic attitude subsequently assumed.  His description of the situation in \"The Last Boer War\" seems to be  more near the truth than any forthcoming: \"The Transvaal, when we  annexed it, was in the position of a man with a knife at his throat,  who is suddenly rescued by some one stronger than he, on certain  conditions which at the time he gladly accepts, but afterwards, when  the danger is passed, wishes to repudiate. In the same way the  inhabitants of the South African Republic were in the time of need  very thankful for our aid, but after a while, when the recollection  of their difficulties had grown faint, when their debts had been  paid and their enemies had been defeated, they began to think that  they would like to get rid of us again, and start fresh on their own  account with a clean sheet.\"    In the management of affairs it appears that Mr. Burgers began to  set an example of the policy which Mr. Kruger has since followed:  the policy of trying to sit on either side of the fence. Mr. Kruger  has struggled more and more violently to accomplish this feat as the  years advance and he advances in years. He has tried to grab the  advantages attendant upon the possession of gold mines and schemed  to acquire a great financial status, and yet at the same time to  keep up his affectation of piety and to maintain his pristine  condition of bucolic irresponsibility. Brought face to face with Sir  T. Shepstone's scheme for annexation, Mr. Burger privately  encouraged the proposed action of the Government--he and his  colleagues even stipulating for pension and office--while publicly  he lifted up his protest against the innovation.    The Boer, with his usual craft, had decided that the British  Government should"]]]
