It is the merit of the Circles that they have effectually suppressed  those ancient heresies which led men to waste energy and sympathy in  the vain belief that conduct depends upon will, effort, training,  encouragement, praise, or anything else but Configuration.  It was  Pantocyclus--the illustrious Circle mentioned above, as the queller of  the Colour Revolt--who first convinced mankind that Configuration makes  the man; that if, for example, you are born an Isosceles with two  uneven sides, you will assuredly go wrong unless you have them made  even--for which purpose you must go to the Isosceles Hospital;  similarly, if you are a Triangle, or Square, or even a Polygon, born  with any Irregularity, you must be taken to one of the Regular  Hospitals to have your disease cured; otherwise you will end your days  in the State Prison or by the angle of the State Executioner.    All faults or defects, from the slightest misconduct to the most  flagitious crime, Pantocyclus attributed to some deviation from perfect  Regularity in the bodily figure, caused perhaps (if not congenital) by  some collision in a crowd; by neglect to take exercise, or by taking  too much of it; or even by a sudden change of temperature, resulting in  a shrinkage or expansion in some too susceptible part of the frame.  Therefore, concluded that illustrious Philosopher, neither good conduct  nor bad conduct is a fit subject, in any sober estimation, for either  praise or blame.  For why should you praise, for example, the integrity  of a Square who faithfully defends the interests of his client, when  you ought in reality rather to admire the exact precision of his right  angles?  Or again, why blame a lying, thievish Isosceles when you ought  rather to deplore the incurable inequality of his sides?    Theoretically, this doctrine is unquestionable; but it has practical  drawbacks.  In dealing with an Isosceles, if a rascal pleads that he  cannot help stealing because of his unevenness, you reply that for that  very reason, because he cannot help being a nuisance to his neighbours,  you, the Magistrate, cannot help sentencing him to be consumed--and  there's an end of the matter.  But in little domestic difficulties,  where the penalty of consumption, or death, is out of the question,  this theory of Configuration sometimes comes in awkwardly; and I must  confess that occasionally when one of my own Hexagonal Grandsons pleads  as an excuse for his disobedience that a sudden change of the  temperature has been too much for his Perimeter, and that I ought to  lay the blame not on him but on his Configuration, which can only be  strengthened by abundance of the choicest sweetmeats, I neither see my  way logically to reject, nor practically to accept, his conclusions.    For my own part, I find it best to assume that a good sound scolding or  castigation has some latent and strengthening influence on my  Grandson's Configuration; though I own that I have no grounds for  thinking so.  At all events I am not alone in my way of extricating  myself from this dilemma; for I find that many of the highest Circles,  sitting as Judges in law courts, use praise and blame towards Regular  and Irregular Figures; and in their homes I know by experience that,  when scolding their children, they speak about \"right\" or \"wrong\" as  vehemently and passionately as if they believed that these names  represented real existences, and that a human Figure is really capable  of choosing between them.    Constantly carrying out their policy of making Configuration the  leading idea in every mind, the Circles reverse the nature of that  Commandment which in Spaceland regulates the relations between parents  and children.  With you, children are taught to honour their parents;  with us--next to the Circles, who are the chief object of universal  homage--a man is taught to honour his Grandson, if he has one; or, if  not, his Son.  By \"honour\", however, is by no means meant \"indulgence\",  but a reverent regard for their highest interests:  and the Circles  teach that the duty of fathers is to subordinate their own interests to  those of posterity, thereby advancing the welfare of the whole State as  well as that of their own immediate descendants.    The weak point in the system of the Circles--if a humble Square may  venture to speak of anything Circular as containing any element of  weakness--appears to me to be found in their relations with Women.    As it is of the utmost importance for Society that Irregular births  should be discouraged, it follows that no Woman who has any  Irregularities in her ancestry is a fit partner for one who desires  that his posterity should rise by regular degrees in the social scale.    Now the Irregularity of a Male is a matter of measurement; but as all  Women are straight, and therefore visibly Regular so to speak, one has  to devise some other means of ascertaining what I may call their  invisible Irregularity, that is to say their potential Irregularities  as regards possible offspring.  This is effected by carefully-kept  pedigrees, which are preserved and supervised by the State; and without  a certified pedigree no Woman is allowed to marry.    Now it might have been supposed that a Circle--proud of his ancestry  and regardful for a posterity which might possibly issue hereafter in a  Chief Circle--would be more careful than any other to choose a wife who  had no blot on her escutcheon.  But it is not so.  The care in choosing  a Regular wife appears to diminish as one rises in the social scale.  Nothing would induce an aspiring Isosceles, who had hopes of generating  an Equilateral Son, to take a wife who reckoned a single Irregularity  among her Ancestors; a Square or Pentagon, who is confident that his  family is steadily on the rise, does not inquire above the  five-hundredth generation; a Hexagon or Dodecagon is even more careless  of the wife's pedigree; but a Circle has been known deliberately to  take a wife who has had an Irregular Great-Grandfather, and all because  of some slight superiority of lustre, or because of the charms of a low  voice--which, with us, even more than you, is thought \"an excellent  thing in Woman\".    Such ill-judged marriages are, as might be expected, barren, if they do  not result in positive Irregularity or in diminution of sides; but none  of these evils have hitherto proved sufficiently deterrent.  The loss  of a few sides in a highly-developed Polygon is not easily noticed, and  is sometimes compensated by a successful operation in the  Neo-Therapeutic Gymnasium, as I have described above; and the Circles  are too much disposed to acquiesce in infecundity as a Law of the  superior development.  Yet, if this evil be not arrested, the gradual  diminution of the Circular class may soon become more rapid, and the  time may be not far distant when, the race being no longer able to  produce a Chief Circle, the Constitution of Flatland must fall.    One other word of warning suggests itself to me, though I cannot so  easily mention a remedy; and this also refers to our relations with  Women.  About three hundred years ago, it was decreed by the Chief  Circle that, since women are deficient in Reason but abundant in  Emotion, they ought no longer to be treated as rational, nor receive  any mental education.  The consequence was that they were no longer  taught to read, nor even to master Arithmetic enough to enable them to  count the angles of their husband or children; and hence they sensibly  declined during each generation in intellectual power.  And this system  of female non-education or quietism still prevails.    My fear is that, with the best intentions, this policy has been carried  so far as to react injuriously on the Male Sex.    For the consequence is that, as things now are, we Males have to lead a  kind of bi-lingual, and I may almost say bi-mental, existence.  With  Women, we speak of \"love\", \"duty\", \"right\", \"wrong\", \"pity\", \"hope\",  and other irrational and emotional conceptions, which have no  existence, and the fiction of which has no object except to control  feminine exuberances; but among ourselves, and in our books, we have an  entirely different vocabulary and I may almost say, idiom.  \"Love\" then  becomes \"the anticipation of benefits\"; \"duty\" becomes \"necessity\" or  \"fitness\"; and other words are correspondingly transmuted.  Moreover,  among Women, we use language implying the utmost deference for their  Sex; and they fully believe that the Chief Circle Himself is not more  devoutly adored by us than they are:  but behind their backs they are  both regarded and spoken of--by all except the very young--as being  little better than \"mindless organisms\".    Our Theology also in the Women's chambers is entirely different from  our Theology elsewhere.    Now my humble fear is that this double training, in language as well as  in thought, imposes somewhat too heavy a burden upon the young,  especially when, at the age of three years old, they are taken from the  maternal care and taught to unlearn the old language--except for the  purpose of repeating it in the presence of their Mothers and  Nurses--and to learn the vocabulary and idiom of science.  Already  methinks I discern a weakness in the grasp of mathematical truth at the  present time as compared with the more robust intellect of our  ancestors three hundred years ago.  I say nothing of the possible  danger if a Woman should ever surreptitiously learn to read and convey  to her Sex the result of her perusal of a single popular volume; nor of  the possibility that the indiscretion or disobedience of some infant  Male might reveal to a Mother the secrets of the logical dialect.  On  the simple ground of the enfeebling of the Male intellect, I rest this  humble appeal to the highest Authorities to reconsider the regulations  of Female education.              PART II:  OTHER WORLDS    \"O brave new worlds,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20102"],[0,"The International Monthly Magazine - Volume V - No II (#11)"],[1,"year 1736 the      time, of birth to Patrick Henry. His parents were in easy      circumstances, but burthened with a numerous family; they resided      at a country scat to which the ambitious name of Mount Brilliant      had been given. In childhood Patrick Henry gave little promise of      distinction. His person is represented as having been coarse, his      manners extremely awkward, his dress slovenly, and his aversion to      study invincible. No persuasion could bring him either to read or      to work. At sixteen his father gave him means to open a small      shop, which failed, however, in less than one year. Then he tried      a small farm, and married; then again he entered upon the life of      a tradesman, but in a few years more was a bankrupt. It was at      this period that he became acquainted with Mr. Jefferson,      afterwards President of the United States. \"Mr. Henry,\" says      Jefferson, \"had a little before broken up his store (shop), or      rather it had broken him up, but his misfortunes were not to be      traced either in his countenance or conduct. His manners had      something of coarseness in them; his passion was music, dancing,      and pleasantry. He excelled in the last, and it attached every one      to him.\"        As a last resource, Patrick Henry now determined to make a trial      of the law. It cannot be said that his preparatory studies were      unduly arduous, since, as his biographer informs us, they were all      comprised in the period of six weeks. Under such unpromising      circumstances, and in the year 1763, he obtained a brief in the      long-contested cause then raging in Virginia between the clergy on      the one side, and the legislature on the other, as regarding the      stipends which the former claimed. On this occasion Henry, to the      astonishment of all who knew him, poured forth a strain of such      impassioned eloquence as not only carried the cause, contrary to      all previous expectation, but placed him ever afterwards at the      head of his profession in the colony. To this very day, says Mr.      Wirt, writing in 1818, the impression remains, and the old people      of that district think that no higher compliment can be paid to      any public speaker than to say of him in their homely phrase, \"He      is almost equal to Patrick when he plead (pleaded) against the      parsons!\"        The natural eloquence which on this occasion flashed forth from      the coarse and unlettered Henry, as the spark-of fire from the      flint, continued to distinguished him both as a Member of the      House of Burgesses at Williamsburg, and afterwards as a member of      Congress. He took from the first a bold and active part against      the pretensions of the mother country; indeed Mr. Jefferson goes      so far as to declare that \"Mr. Henry certainly gave the earliest      impulse to the ball of revolution.\" His most celebrated burst of      oratory, or rather turn of phrase, was in this very year 1765,      when descanting in the House of Burgesses on the tyranny of the      Stamp Act. \"Caesar--\" he cried, in a voice of thunder and with an      eye of fire--\"Caesar had his Brutus--Charles the First had his      Cromwell--and George the Third\"--\"Treason!\" here exclaimed the      Speaker, \"Treason! Treason!\" re-echoed from every part of the      House. Henry did not for an instant falter, but fixing his eye      firmly on the Speaker, he concluded his sentence thus \"--may profit      by their example. If this be treason make the most of it!\"        Indolence and aversion to reading seemed almost as natural to      Henry's mind as powers of debate. To the last he never overcame      them. Thus, at his death, in 1799, his books were found to be      extremely few, and these too consisting chiefly of odd volumes.      But his gift of speech was (for his hearers) sufficiently      supported by his fiery energy, his practical shrewdness, and his      ever keen glance into the feelings and characters of other. Nor      were these his only claims to his country's favor. He retained the      manners and custom of the common people, with what his friendly      biographer terms \"religious caution.--He dressed as plainly as the      plainest of them,\" continues Mr. Wirt, \"ate only their homely      fare, and drank their simple beverage, mixed with them on a      footing of the most entire and perfect equality, and conversed      with them even in their own vicious and depraved pronunciation.\"      By such means he soon acquired and long retained a large measure      of popularity, and he applied himself with zeal and success before      any audience, and on every occasion which arose, to increase and      perpetuate the estrangement between the North American Colonies      and England.                                      FRANKLIN.        Dr. Benjamin Franklin is one of those men who have made the task      of succeeding biographers more difficult by having been in part      their own. He was born at Boston in 1706, the youngest of ten      sons. \"My father,\" he says, \"intended to devote me, as the tithe      of his sons, to the service of the Church;\" but on further      reflection, the charges of a college education were thought too      burthensome, and young Benjamin became a journeyman printer. From      a very early age he showed a passionate fondness for reading, and      much ingenuity in argument, but, as he acknowledges, had at first      contracted a disputatious and wrangling turn of conversation. \"I      have since observed,\" he says, \"that persons of good sense seldom      fall into it, except lawyers, University-men, and generally men of      all sorts who have been bred at Edinburgh.\"        Young Franklin was at first bound apprentice to one of his elder      brothers, a printer at Boston; but some differences arising      between them, he proceeded to Philadelphia, where he soon obtained      employment, and ere long set up for himself. His success in life      was secured by his great frugality, industry, and shrewdness. In      his own words: \"I spent no time in taverns, games, or frolics of      any kind; reading was the only amusement I allowed myself.\" His      knowledge and shrewdness,--great zeal in urging any improvements,      and great ingenuity in promoting them,--speedily raised him high in      the estimation of his fellow-townsmen, and enabled him to take a      forward part in all the affairs of his province. In England, and      indeed all Europe, he became celebrated by his experiments and      discoveries in electricity. These may deserve the greater credit      when we recollect both their practical utility and their      unassisted progress,--how much the pointed rods which he introduced      have tended to avert the dangers of lightning, and how far removed      was Franklin at the time from all scientific society, libraries,      or patronage.        It has also been stated by no less an authority in science than      Sir Humphrey Davy, that \"the style and manner of Dr. Franklin's      publication on Electricity are almost as worthy of admiration as      the doctrine it contains.\" The same remark may indeed be applied      to all his writings. All of them are justly celebrated for their      clear, plain, and lively style, free from every appearance of art,      but, in fact, carefully pointed and nicely poised. In public      speaking, on the other hand, he was much less eminent. His last      American biographer observes of him, that he never even pretended      to the accomplishments of an orator or debater. He seldom spoke in      a deliberative assembly, except for some special object, and then      only for a few minutes at a time.        As a slight instance of Franklin's humor and shrewdness in all      affairs of common life I may quote the following: \"QUESTION. I am      about courting a girl I have had but little acquaintance with. How      shall I come to a knowledge of her faults? ANSWER. Commend her      among her female acquaintance!\"        Whether in science and study, or in politics and action, the great      aim of Franklin's mind was ever practical utility. Here again we      may quote Sir Humphrey Davy as saying of Franklin that he sought      rather to make philosophy a useful inmate and servant in the      common habitations of man, than to preserve her merely as an      object of admiration in temples and palaces. Thus, also, in      affairs he had a keen eye to his own interest, but likewise a      benevolent concern for the public good. Nor was he ever      indifferent to cases of individual grievance or hardship. In the      pursuit of his objects, public or private, he was, beyond most      other men, calm, sagacious, and wary; neither above business nor      yet below it; never turned aside from it by flights of fancy nor      yet by bursts of passion.        Among the good qualities which we may with just cause ascribe to      Franklin we cannot number any firm reliance on the truths of      Revelation. Only five weeks before his death we find him express a      cold approbation of the \"system of morals\" bequeathed to us by      \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" In his Memoirs he declares that he always      believed in the existence of a Deity and a future state of rewards      and punishments, but he adds that although he continued to adhere      to his first--the Presbyterian--sect, some of its dogmas appeared to      him unintelligible, and others doubtful. \"I early absented myself      from the public assemblies of the sect; and I seldom attended any      public worship; Sunday being my studying day.\"        Such being Franklin's own practice, and such his own description      of it as to public worship, it seems worthy of note that it was he      who in the American Convention brought forward a motion for daily      prayers. \"I have lived, Sir,\" said he, \"a long time, and the      longer"]]]
