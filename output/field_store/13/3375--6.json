Sure, it's an honourable gintleman ye'll  make, if ye don't let the crockydivils get ye before your time.  That's  betther,\" he said, mounting.  \"Howlt on very tight to the horse's mane,  Masther Dick; and if ye feel one of the bastes feeling and poking ye  about wid his nose before getting a good grip, jist you call out, and  I'll put on the speed to drag ye away.\"    \"I wouldn't let my feet dabble in the water, Dinny,\" said Dick,  wickedly.  \"The crocodiles snap at hands or feet held over in their  track.\"    \"What'll I do, then?\" cried Dinny, in alarm.    \"I'd put my feet in my pockets, if I were you,\" said Dick.    \"Sure, an' it's a boy ye are for a joke, Masther Dick,\" cried Dinny  grimly.  \"I'll howlt me legs up very high.  Ah! what are ye shouting  about?  We're coming.\"    \"Make haste there, Dick.  Is anything wrong?\"    \"No, father!\" shouted back Dick.  \"There, get along with you.  Give him  his head, Dinny, and he'll go straight across.\"    \"I'd better make him canter, hadn't I, Masther Dick, dear?\"    \"Canter?  Nonsense!  Why, the poor thing has enough to do to keep his  feet walking.\"    \"Then it isn't safe at all crossing the river, Masther Dick, dear.  And  ah, I daren't go like this, wid me riding the good honest baste and you  walking.  What'll the masther say?\"    \"That you are a terrible coward, Dinny,\" replied Dick.    \"Be aisy, Masther Dick.  It isn't being a coward, it's thinking av my  poor mother, and taking care of meself for the poor owld sowl's sake.  Whisht, Masther Dick, dear, jump up behind and hold on by me, and the  baste'll carry us both over.\"    \"It's rather hard on the horse, Dinny, but I don't want to get wet, so  here goes.  Hold tight.\"    Dick took a leap, \"fly the garter\" fashion, and came down astride the  bay, but startling it so that it began to rear and plunge.    \"Aisy, Masther Dick, dear, or I'll be off.  Be quiet, ye baste.  What's  the matter wid ye?  Quiet, now!\"    \"Is anything the matter there?\" came from out of the darkness across the  river.    \"No-o-o-o!\" roared Dick, drumming the bay's ribs with his heels.  \"Trek!  go on, old fellow.\"    \"Oh, take care, Masther Dick, dear, whatever ye do,\" whined Dinny.    \"Oh, I'll take care,\" cried Dick, assuming the lead, and leaning forward  so as to get the reins.  \"There, I'll guide; you hold him tightly with  your knees.  Go on, bay.\"    On went the bay steadily enough; and there was no disposition to waver  now, even in the sharpest parts of the stream, for the extra weight upon  his back made him firmer.  But just as they reached the middle of the  river a mischievous idea entered Dick's head, and suddenly with one foot  he made a splash, while with the other he pressed Dinny's leg against  the horse's side.    \"Murther!  Help!\" yelled Dinny.  \"He's got me at last!\" and throwing  himself in the opposite direction, Dick only managed to save himself by  nipping the horse.  As for Dinny, he went head over heels into the  running stream, being borne back, however, by the current against Dick's  legs, when, grasping him by the collar, Dick urged the horse on, Dinny  supplementing his young master's hold by a most tenacious grasp, till  the horse's hoofs began to plash in the shallower water, and poor Dinny  was dragged out on to dry land.    \"Why, what have you been about, Dinny?\" cried Mr Rogers angrily.  \"Why  didn't you come over with us?\"    \"Sure, sor, I'm kilt entoirely,\" groaned Dinny, rubbing his leg.  \"Twice  over the savage bastes have had hold of me, and if I hadn't thrown  meself on the other side of the bay horse, it's this minute they'd be  aiting of me up.\"    \"Jump up and come along,\" cried Mr Rogers.  \"It's my belief, Dinny,  that you are a great coward.  Here, make haste, the waggon's nearly a  mile ahead.\"    \"Oh, masther, it was a narrow escape,\" groaned Dinny, who did not  attempt to move.    \"It will be a narrower one, Dinny, if you stay there, for the Zulu tells  me that this is a favourite spot for lions to lie in wait for the bok  and zebra that come down to drink.\"    \"Oh, masther dear, why didn't ye say so before?\" cried Dinny, jumping up  with alacrity.  \"Sure I'd be the first to tell a man if he was in  danger.\"    Mr Rogers did not reply, but went on with his son, Dinny keeping very  close behind, till they overtook the waggon just as it reached the  camping-place, where a fire was soon burning, and the oxen contentedly  cropping the ample supply of excellent grass.        CHAPTER TEN.    A GLORIOUS SIGHT FOR A HUNTER.    Watch was set in the usual manner, so that the fire might be well kept  up, and after a good dry, and a hearty meal--such a one as is made by  those who have toiled all day in the open air--those who were at liberty  so to do soon sought their blankets, and slept soundly and well.    To Dick and Jack it seemed that they had only just lain down, when there  was a firm hand laid upon them, and they were awakened by the General,  who signed to them in the grey morning light to get up.    They crept out of the waggon yawning, but that sign of slothfulness was  soon chased away, and their father joining them, they took their guns  and followed the General, leaving Dinny with orders to wake the boys,  and to get breakfast ready by their return.    \"Where are we going, father?\" asked Dick.    \"I can't say, my boy.  The Zulu awakened me as he did you.  He has  something to show us, I suppose.\"    Their way lay up a woodland slope, where the trees had a park-like  aspect, and beneath their shade it was still quite dim, but here and  there they caught glimpses of the sky, which was flecked with little  clouds of orange, and vermilion, and gold, while the light was rapidly  growing in the east.    The General went on rapidly, as if quite sure of his route, and it  seemed that the point at which he was aiming was the highest part of a  ridge.    And so it proved, for when he had reached the summit the Zulu chief  walked cautiously along for a short distance, and then stopped and  stooped down, motioning to those who followed to do the same.    They obeyed him implicitly, preparing their pieces at the same time.  Then creeping up to him cautiously, they found that they were on a ridge  looking down into a widespread valley, flooded with the light of the  approaching sunrise.    It was a glorious scene, and worth all the trouble and patience of their  long journey to see.  It was almost breathlessly that they gazed at the  broad, grassy valley, with its clumps of trees, patches of wood, and  portions dotted with masses of rock, whose tops were bathed in the amber  morning tints, while in the direction where the little party gazed the  shadows of tree and stone lay dark.    Facing them in the east the clouds were now gorgeous in their hues, one  layer forming a grand arch of light, towards which darted upwards the  rays of the coming sun.    But it was not only the sunrise that was glorious in the extreme, nor  the beauty of the broad valley that held the spectators' eyes, but the  occupants of the scene below.    The General had undertaken to guide them to what he called the great  game country, and he had kept his word.  For below them--to right, to  left, and away towards the golden burst of glory where the sun was about  to rise--the land was literally alive with game.    Down to their right spread broad marshy lagoon after lagoon, in which  swam, dived or waded, countless ducks and crane.  Here, writhing its  snaky neck and curious head and beak, was the flamingo, all white and  rose; there, soft grey cranes and others, with a lovely crest, as if in  imitation of the rays of the rising sun.    But it was not the wondrous variety of birds alone that took their  attention, but the large game, feeding, gambolling, and careering in  countless herds.  To the left were zebras, and beyond some quaggas, or  wild asses, the peculiar bray or cry of _quay-gah_! _quay-gah_! reaching  to their ears.  On their right there were gnus, or wildebeestes, as the  Boers called them, brindled and the blue--curiously fierce-looking  little animals, partaking both of the character of the deer and the  buffalo.  Some grazed placidly in the morning light, others were engaged  in tilting at each other with their horns, while their companions looked  on as if waiting for their turn; and every now and then the sound of the  striking horns ascended to the woody ridge with a loud crash.    But while these creatures contended together, groups of antelopes were  dotted here and there, while others careered at lightning speed over the  plain.    The sight was wonderful, and the boys felt as if they would never tire  of watching the evolutions of the graceful creatures, which, with their  skins glistening and horns looking golden in the morning light, seemed  to be going through a series of military evolutions with the greatest  precision.    \"Koodoo, pronghorn,\" said Mr Rogers, looking at the herd through his  glass.  \"There are a dozen elands too,\" he continued, and then passed  the glass to his sons.    \"Oh, this is grand,\" cried Dick enthusiastically.  \"I could stay here  for ever watching the graceful creatures.\"    \"So could I,\" said Jack, after breakfast.  \"I say, father, hadn't we  better shoot something--the stock's getting low?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr Rogers quietly; and he longed to go himself and bring  down a good fat buck for the replenishment of the larder; but the  expedition was for his sons, and he gave place to them.  \"Now, Dick,\" he  continued, \"here is a chance for you to try and stalk one of those  hartebeestes; or better still, a nice fat antelope.  Pick out one with a  fine head of horns, and then aim straight at the shoulder, and be sure  and bring him down.\"    \"At what distance would you fire, father?\" asked Dick.    \"I'd get as close as I could, my boy, but I'd fire at six or seven  hundred yards sooner than miss a shot.  Now go!\"    Dick crept off, his father giving him a warning"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21381"],[0,"Stories Of Ohio (#11)"],[1,"m, but which had yielded  to the persecutions of white men and red men alike when, in 1771, the  chiefs of the Delawares sent messages to the Moravians and invited  them to come out and live among them in Ohio. The Lenni-lenape, as the  Delawares called themselves, had left the East, where they were subject  to the Iroquois, and they now had their chief towns on the Muskingum.  Near the place where the Tuscarawas and Walhonding meet to form the  Muskingum they offered lands to the Moravians, and in 1772 the Christian  Indians left their last village in Western Pennsylvania and settled  there at three points which they called Schoenbrun, the Beautiful Spring,  Lichtenau, Field of Light, and Gnadenhutten, the Tents of Grace.    It was in the very heart of the Western wilderness, but the land was  rich and the savages friendly, and in a few years the teachers and their  followers had founded a fairer and happier home than they had known  before, and had begun to spread their light around them. The Indians  came from far and near to see their fields and orchards and gardens,  with the houses in the midst of them, built of squared logs and set on  streets branching to the four quarters from the chapel, which was the  peaceful citadel of each little town. It must have seemed a stately  edifice to their savage eyes, with its shingled roof, and its belfry,  where, ten years before any white man had settled beyond the Ohio,  the bell called the Christian Indians to prayer. No doubt the creature  comforts of the Christians had their charm, too, for the hungry pagans.  They were not used elsewhere to the hospitality that could set before  them such repasts as one of the missionaries tells us were spread for  the guest at Gnadenhutten. A table furnished with \"good bread, meat,  butter, cheese, milk, tea and coffee, and chocolate,\" and such fruits and  vegetables as the season afforded could hardly have been less wonderful  in the Indian's eyes than red men with their hair cut, and without paint  or feathers, at work in the fields like squaws.    Their heathen neighbors began to come into the Moravians' peaceful  fold, and the three villages grew and flourished till the war broke out  between the colonies and Great Britain. Then the troubles and sorrows  of the Moravians, white and red, began again. They were too weak to keep  the savage war parties from passing through their towns, and they dared  not refuse them rest and food. The warriors began to come with the first  leaves of spring, and they came and went till the first snows of autumn  made their trail too plain for them to escape pursuit from the border.  The Moravians did what they could to ransom their captives and to save  them from torture when the warriors returned after their raids, but all  their goodness did not avail them against the suspicion of the settlers.  The backwoodsmen looked on them as the spies and allies of the  savages, and the savages on their side believed them in league with the  Americans.    The Delawares had promised the Moravian teachers that if they settled  among them, the Delaware nation would take no part in the war, and the  most of 'them kept their promise. But some of the young men broke it,  and the nation would not forbid the Wyandots from passing through  their country to and from the Virginia frontier. It was true that the  Moravians held thousands of Delaware warriors neutral, and that our  American officers knew their great power for good among the Indians;  but the backwoodsmen hated them as bitterly as they hated the Wyandots.  Their war parties passed through the Christian villages, too, when they  went and came on their forays beyond the Ohio, and at one time their  leaders could hardly keep them from destroying a Moravian town, even  while they were enjoying its hospitality.    This situation could not last. In August, 1781, a chief of the Hurons,  called the Half King, came with a large body of Indians flying the  English flag and accompanied by an English officer, to urge the  Christians to remove to Sandusky, where they were told they could be  safe from the Virginians. They refused, and then the Half King shot  their cattle, plundered their fields and houses, and imprisoned their  teachers, and at last forced them away. When the winter came on, the  exiles began to suffer from cold and hunger, and many of their children  died. To keep themselves and their little ones from starving, parties  stole back from Sandusky throughout the winter to gather the corn left  standing in the fields beside the Muskingum.    In March a larger party than usual returned to the deserted villages  with a number of women and children, all unarmed, except for the guns  that the men carried to shoot game. But in February the savages had  fallen upon a lonely cabin and butchered all its inmates with more than  common cruelty, and the whole border was ablaze with fury against the  redskins, whether they called themselves Christians or not. A hundred  and sixty backwoodsmen gathered at Mingo Bottom under the lead of  Colonel David Williamson, who had once disgraced himself among them by  preventing them from killing some Moravian prisoners, and who now seems  to have been willing to atone for his humanity. They marched swiftly to  the Muskingum, where they stole upon the Indians in the cornfields, and  seized their guns. They told them at first that they were going to take  them to Fort Pitt, and at the vote held to decide whether they should  burn their prisoners alive or simply tomahawk and scalp them, there  was really some question of their transfer to Pittsburg. This plan was  favored by the leaders, and it is believed that if Colonel Williamson  could have had his way, it would have been carried out. But there is no  proof of this, and the rest, who were by no means the worst men of the  border, but some of the best, voted by a large majority to kill their  prisoners.    They gave them the night to prepare for death. One poor woman fell on  her knees before Williamson and begged for her life, but the most of  them seem to have submitted without a word. They spent the night in  prayer and singing, and when their butchers sent at daybreak to know if  they were ready, they answered that they had received the assurance of  God's peace. Then the murderers parted the women and children from the  men and shut them up in another cabin, and the two cabins they fitly  called the slaughterhouses. One of them found a cooper's mallet in the  cooper's shop, where the men were left, and saying: \"How exactly this  will answer for the business,\" he made his way through the kneeling  ranks to one of the most fervent of the converts, and struck him down.    While the Indians still prayed and sang, he killed twelve more of them,  and then passed the mallet to another butcher with the words: \"My arm  fails me. Go on in the same way. I think I have done pretty well.\" Among  the women and children the slaughter began with a very old and pious  widow, and soon the sound of the singing and the praying was silenced in  death.    The victims were scalped as they fell, and when the bloody work was  done, the cabins were set on fire and the bodies burned in the burning  buildings. Two boys who had been scalped with the rest feigned death,  and when the murderers had left them they tried to escape. One stuck  fast in the window and was burned, but the other got safely away and  lived to tell the awful tale.    [Illustration: Massacre of the Christian Indians by the Whites 087]    The backwoodsmen themselves seem not to have been ashamed of their work,  though it is said that Williamson could never be got to speak of it. The  event was so horrible that it killed the Moravians' hopes of usefulness  among the Ohio Indians. The teachers settled with the remnant of  their converts in Canada, but the Christian Indians always longed for  Gnadenhutten, where they had lived so happily, and where ninety-six  of their brethren had suffered so innocently. Before the close of the  century Congress confirmed the Delawares' grant of the Muskingum lands  to them, and they came back. But they could not survive the crime  committed against them. The white settlers pressed close about them; the  War of 1812 enkindled all the old hate against their race. Their laws  were trampled upon and their own people were seen drunk in the streets.    Some of the Christians had fallen back into heathen savagery. One of  these, who was found in a war party, painted and armed like the rest for  a foray against the whites, said to a Christian brother: \"I cannot but  have bad thoughts of our teachers. I think it was their fault that so  many of our countrymen were murdered in Gnadenhutten. They betrayed  us.... Tell me now, is this the truth or not?\" He had lost his children  and all his kindred in that fearful carnage, and yet he could not  believe his own accusations against the Moravians. He added mournfully:  \"I have now a wicked and malicious heart, and therefore my thoughts are  evil. As I look outwardly, so is my heart within. What would it avail,  if I were outwardly to appear as a believer, and my heart were full of  evil?\"          IX. THE TORTURE OF COLONEL CRAWFORD    The slaughter of the Christian Indians at Gnadenhutten took place  in March, 1782, and in May ol the same year, four hundred and fifty  horsemen from the American border met at Mingo Bottom, where the  murderers had rendezvoused, and set out from that point to massacre  the Moravian converts who had taken refuge among the Wyandots on the  Sandusky. They expected, of course, to fight the warlike Indians, but  they openly avowed their purpose of killing all Indians, Christian or  heathen, and women and children, as well as warriors. We must therefore  call them murderers, but we must remember that they had been hardened  against mercy by the atrocities of the savages, and we must make  allowance for men who had seen their"]]]
