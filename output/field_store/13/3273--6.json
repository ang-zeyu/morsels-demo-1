Innumerable combinations of the words defined in Sec. 109 with one  another and with other words occur. Some of these combinations with  their approximate meanings follow. The meaning of any such expression  not found in the list may usually be arrived at by consulting the terms  defined in paragraph 109 and recalling the use of certain auxiliary  terms quoted in Chapter IX.         _Largo assai_--very slow.         _Largo di molto_--very slow.         _Largo ma non troppo_--slow, but not too slow.         _Largo un poco_--slow, but not so slow as _largo_. (_Cf.       larghetto_.)         _Lentemente_--slowly.         _Lentando_--with increasing slowness.         _Tres lentement_--very slowly.         _Lentissamente_--very slowly.         _Lentissamamente_--very slowly.         _Lento assai_--very slowly.         _Lento a capriccio_--slowly but capriciously.         _Lento di molto_--very slowly.         _Andante affettuoso_--moderately slow, and with tenderness and       pathos. [Transcriber's Note: Corrected error \"affetuoso\" in       original.]         _Andante amabile_--moderately slow, and lovingly.         _Andante cantabile_--moderately slow, and in singing style.         _Andante grazioso_--moderately slow, and gracefully.         _Andante maestoso_--moderately slow, and majestically.         _Andante con moto_--slightly faster than _andante_.         _Andante (ma) non troppo_--not too slowly.         _Andante pastorale_--moderately slow, and in simple and       unaffected style; (lit. rural, pastoral).         _Andante quasi allegro_--almost as rapid in tempo as       _allegro_; (lit. an _andante_ in the style of _allegro_).         _Andante sostenuto_--moderately slow and sustained.         _Allegrissimo_--much faster than _allegro_. (The superlative       degree of _allegro_.)         _Allegro agitato_--a moderately rapid tempo, and in agitated       style.         _Allegro appassionata_--a moderately rapid tempo, and in       passionate style.         _Allegro assai_ (very _allegro_)--faster than _allegro_.         _Allegro commodo_--a conveniently rapid tempo.         _Allegro con brio_--an _allegro_ played in brilliant style.       Faster than _allegro_.         _Allegro con fuoco_--an _allegro_ played with fire, _i.e._,       with extreme animation. Faster than _allegro_.         _Allegro con spirito_--an _allegro_ performed with spirit.         _Allegro con moto_--faster than _allegro_.         _Allegro di bravura_--an _allegro_ performed in brilliant       style, _i.e._, demanding great skill in execution.         _Allegro furioso_ (furiously)--quicker than _allegro_; very       brilliant.         _Allegro giusto_--an _allegro_ movement, but in exact rhythm.         _Allegro ma grazioso_--an _allegro_ played in graceful style.         _Allegro (ma) non tanto_--an _allegro_ movement, but not too       rapid.         _Allegro (ma) non troppo_--an _allegro_ movement, but not too       rapid.         _Allegro (ma) non presto_--an _allegro_ movement, but not too       rapid.         _Allegro moderato_--slower than _allegro_.         _Allegro vivace_--faster than _allegro_.         _Presto assai_--as rapidly as possible.         _Presto (ma) non troppo_--a _presto_ movement, but not too       rapid.    111. There are certain _terms which indicate a modification of the  normal tempo_ of a movement, these being divided into two classes, (a)  those terms which indicate in general a slower tempo, and (b) those  which indicate in general a more rapid tempo. The further subdivisions  of these two classes are shown below.    (_a_) Terms indicating a slower tempo.         1. Terms indicating a _gradual_ retard.         _Ritenente_, (_rit._), _ritenuto_ (_rit._), _ritardando_       (_rit._), _rallentando_ (_rall._), _slentando_.         2. Terms indicating a tempo which is to become definitely       slower _at once_.         _Piu lento_ (lit. more slowly), _meno mosso_ (lit. less       movement).         3. Terms indicating a slower tempo combined with an increase       in power.         _Largando_, _allargando._ These words are both derived from       _largo_, meaning large, broad.    (For terms indicating both slower tempo and softer tone, see page 59,  Sec. 127.)         The student should note the difference between groups 1 and 2       as given above: the terms in group 1 indicate that each       measure, and even each pulse in the measure, is a little       slower than the preceding one, while such terms as _piu lento_       and _meno mosso_ indicate a rate of speed becoming instantly       slower and extending over an entire phrase or passage. Some       composers (_e.g._, Beethoven and Couperin) have evidently had       this same distinction in mind between _rallentando_ and       _ritardando_ on the one hand, and _ritenuto_ and _ritenente_       on the other, considering the former (_rall._ and _rit._) to       indicate a gradually slackening speed, and the latter       (_ritenuto_ and _ritenente_) to indicate a definitely slower       rate. The majority of composers do not however differentiate       between them in this way, and it will therefore hardly be       worth while for the student to try to remember the       distinction.    (_b_) Terms indicating a more rapid tempo.         1. Terms indicating a gradual acceleration.         _Accelerando_, _affrettando_ [Transcriber's Note: Corrected       misspelling \"affretando\" in original] (this term implies some       degree of excitement also), _stringendo_, _poco a poco       animato_.         2. Terms indicating a tempo which is to become definitely       faster at once.         _Piu allegro_, _piu tosto_, _piu mosso_, _stretto_, _un poco       animato_.    112. After any modification in tempo (either faster or slower) has been  suggested it is usual to indicate a return to the normal rate by some  such expression as _a tempo_ (lit. in time), _a tempo primo_ (lit. in  the first time), _tempo primo_, or _tempo_.    113. _Tempo rubato_ (or _a tempo rubato_) means literally _in robbed  time_, _i.e._, duration taken from one measure or beat and given to  another, but in modern practice the term is quite generally applied to  any irregularity of rhythm or tempo not definitely indicated in the  score.    The terms _ad libitum_, (_ad lib._), _a piacere_, and _a capriccio_,  also indicate a modification of the tempo at the will of the performer.  _Ad libitum_ means at liberty; _a piacere_, at pleasure; and _a  capriccio_, at the caprice (of the performer).    114. The term _tempo giusto_ is the opposite of _tempo rubato_ (and of  the other terms defined in paragraph 113). It means literally _in exact  time_. (_Tempo giusto_ is sometimes translated _quite rapidly_,[29] but  this is very unusual.)    [Footnote 29: Bussler--Elements of Notation and Harmony, p. 76.]    115. _L'istesso tempo_ means--at the same rate of speed. _E.g._, when a  measure signature changes from 2/4 to 6/8 with a change in beat-note  from a quarter to a dotted-quarter, but with the same tempo carried  through the entire movement.    116. _Tenuto_ (_ten._) indicates that a tone or chord is to be held to  its full value. This word is sometimes used after a staccato passage to  show that the staccato effect is to be discontinued, but is often used  merely as a warning not to slight a melody-tone--_i.e._, to give it its  full value.    117. _Veloce_ means--swiftly, and is applied to brilliant passages  (_e.g._, cadenzas) which are to be played as rapidly as possible without  much regard for measure rhythm. The words _rapidamente_, _brillante_ and  _volante_ (flying) have the same meaning as _veloce_.    118. The following _expressions referring to tempo_ are also in common  use but cannot easily be classified with any of the groups already  defined.         _Con moto_--with motion; _i.e._, not too slow.         _Pesante_--slowly, heavily.         _Doppio movimento_--twice as rapid as before.         _Tempo ordinario_--in ordinary tempo.         _Tempo commodo_--in convenient tempo.         _Sempre lento malinconico assai_--always slowly and in a very       melancholy style.         _Animando_, _animato_, _con anima_--with animation.         _Agitato_--agitated.    119. _Tempo di marcia_ is given by Riemann (Dictionary of Music, p. 783)  as equivalent to _andante_, M.M. 72-84. The same writer gives _tempo di  menuetto_ as equivalent to _allegretto_, and _tempo di valso_ as  equivalent to _allegro moderato_ (which he regards as indicating a more  rapid tempo than _allegretto_).          CHAPTER XIII    DYNAMICS      120. The word _dynamics_ (cf. dynamic--the opposite of static) as used  in the nomenclature of music has to do with the various degrees of power  (_i.e._, the comparative loudness and softness) of tones.    As in the case of words referring to tempo, the expressions referring to  _dynamics_ are always relative, never absolute; it is possible to  indicate that one measure is to be louder than another, but it is not  possible (nor desirable) to indicate exactly how loud either is to be.  Thus _dynamics_, perhaps even more than tempo, will be seen to depend on  the taste of the performer or conductor.    The following _words referring to dynamics_ are in common use:         _Pianisissimo_ (_ppp_)--as softly as possible. (It will be       noted that this is a sort of hyper-superlative of _piano_.)         _Pianissimo_ (_pp_)--very softly. (The superlative of       _piano_.)         _Piano_ (_p_)--softly.         _Mezzo piano_ (_mp_)--medium softly.         _Mezzo forte_ (_mf_)--medium loudly.         _Forte_ (_f_)--loudly (lit. strong).         _Fortissimo_ (_ff_)--very loudly. (The superlative of       _forte_.)         _Fortisissimo_ (_fff_)--as loudly as possible.         The lack of a one-word comparative degree in the case of both       _piano_ and _forte_ seems to necessitate the hyper-superlative       degree as given above, but the practice of using four,"]]]
