But close as Flambeau was to the house, he heard the  words of his colleagues by the wall, and repeated them in a low voice.    \"Yes, they will meet now after all!\"    \"They will never meet,\" said Father Brown. \"Hirsch was right when he  said that in such an affair the principals must not meet. Have you  read a queer psychological story by Henry James, of two persons who so  perpetually missed meeting each other by accident that they began to  feel quite frightened of each other, and to think it was fate? This is  something of the kind, but more curious.\"    \"There are people in Paris who will cure them of such morbid fancies,\"  said Valognes vindictively. \"They will jolly well have to meet if we  capture them and force them to fight.\"    \"They will not meet on the Day of Judgement,\" said the priest. \"If God  Almighty held the truncheon of the lists, if St Michael blew the trumpet  for the swords to cross--even then, if one of them stood ready, the  other would not come.\"    \"Oh, what does all this mysticism mean?\" cried the Duc de Valognes,  impatiently; \"why on earth shouldn't they meet like other people?\"    \"They are the opposite of each other,\" said Father Brown, with a queer  kind of smile. \"They contradict each other. They cancel out, so to  speak.\"    He continued to gaze at the darkening trees opposite, but Valognes  turned his head sharply at a suppressed exclamation from Flambeau. That  investigator, peering into the lighted room, had just seen the Colonel,  after a pace or two, proceed to take his coat off. Flambeau's first  thought was that this really looked like a fight; but he soon dropped  the thought for another. The solidity and squareness of Dubosc's chest  and shoulders was all a powerful piece of padding and came off with his  coat. In his shirt and trousers he was a comparatively slim gentleman,  who walked across the bedroom to the bathroom with no more pugnacious  purpose than that of washing himself. He bent over a basin, dried his  dripping hands and face on a towel, and turned again so that the strong  light fell on his face. His brown complexion had gone, his big black  moustache had gone; he--was clean-shaven and very pate. Nothing remained  of the Colonel but his bright, hawk-like, brown eyes. Under the wall  Father Brown was going on in heavy meditation, as if to himself.    \"It is all just like what I was saying to Flambeau. These opposites  won't do. They don't work. They don't fight. If it's white instead of  black, and solid instead of liquid, and so on all along the line--then  there's something wrong, Monsieur, there's something wrong. One of these  men is fair and the other dark, one stout and the other slim, one strong  and the other weak. One has a moustache and no beard, so you can't see  his mouth; the other has a beard and no moustache, so you can't see his  chin. One has hair cropped to his skull, but a scarf to hide his neck;  the other has low shirt-collars, but long hair to bide his skull. It's  all too neat and correct, Monsieur, and there's something wrong. Things  made so opposite are things that cannot quarrel. Wherever the one  sticks out the other sinks in. Like a face and a mask, like a lock and a  key...\"    Flambeau was peering into the house with a visage as white as a sheet.  The occupant of the room was standing with his back to him, but in front  of a looking-glass, and had already fitted round his face a sort  of framework of rank red hair, hanging disordered from the head and  clinging round the jaws and chin while leaving the mocking mouth  uncovered. Seen thus in the glass the white face looked like the face of  Judas laughing horribly and surrounded by capering flames of hell. For  a spasm Flambeau saw the fierce, red-brown eyes dancing, then they were  covered with a pair of blue spectacles. Slipping on a loose black coat,  the figure vanished towards the front of the house. A few moments later  a roar of popular applause from the street beyond announced that Dr  Hirsch had once more appeared upon the balcony.            FOUR -- The Man in the Passage      TWO men appeared simultaneously at the two ends of a sort of passage  running along the side of the Apollo Theatre in the Adelphi. The evening  daylight in the streets was large and luminous, opalescent and empty.  The passage was comparatively long and dark, so each man could see the  other as a mere black silhouette at the other end. Nevertheless, each  man knew the other, even in that inky outline; for they were both men of  striking appearance and they hated each other.    The covered passage opened at one end on one of the steep streets of the  Adelphi, and at the other on a terrace overlooking the sunset-coloured  river. One side of the passage was a blank wall, for the building it  supported was an old unsuccessful theatre restaurant, now shut up. The  other side of the passage contained two doors, one at each end. Neither  was what was commonly called the stage door; they were a sort of special  and private stage doors used by very special performers, and in this  case by the star actor and actress in the Shakespearean performance of  the day. Persons of that eminence often like to have such private exits  and entrances, for meeting friends or avoiding them.    The two men in question were certainly two such friends, men who  evidently knew the doors and counted on their opening, for each  approached the door at the upper end with equal coolness and confidence.  Not, however, with equal speed; but the man who walked fast was the man  from the other end of the tunnel, so they both arrived before the secret  stage door almost at the same instant. They saluted each other with  civility, and waited a moment before one of them, the sharper walker who  seemed to have the shorter patience, knocked at the door.    In this and everything else each man was opposite and neither could  be called inferior. As private persons both were handsome, capable and  popular. As public persons, both were in the first public rank. But  everything about them, from their glory to their good looks, was of a  diverse and incomparable kind. Sir Wilson Seymour was the kind of man  whose importance is known to everybody who knows. The more you mixed  with the innermost ring in every polity or profession, the more often  you met Sir Wilson Seymour. He was the one intelligent man on twenty  unintelligent committees--on every sort of subject, from the reform of  the Royal Academy to the project of bimetallism for Greater Britain.  In the Arts especially he was omnipotent. He was so unique that nobody  could quite decide whether he was a great aristocrat who had taken up  Art, or a great artist whom the aristocrats had taken up. But you could  not meet him for five minutes without realizing that you had really been  ruled by him all your life.    His appearance was \"distinguished\" in exactly the same sense; it was at  once conventional and unique. Fashion could have found no fault with his  high silk hat--, yet it was unlike anyone else's hat--a little higher,  perhaps, and adding something to his natural height. His tall, slender  figure had a slight stoop yet it looked the reverse of feeble. His hair  was silver-grey, but he did not look old; it was worn longer than the  common yet he did not look effeminate; it was curly but it did not  look curled. His carefully pointed beard made him look more manly and  militant than otherwise, as it does in those old admirals of Velazquez  with whose dark portraits his house was hung. His grey gloves were a  shade bluer, his silver-knobbed cane a shade longer than scores of  such gloves and canes flapped and flourished about the theatres and the  restaurants.    The other man was not so tall, yet would have struck nobody as short,  but merely as strong and handsome. His hair also was curly, but fair and  cropped close to a strong, massive head--the sort of head you break a  door with, as Chaucer said of the Miller's. His military moustache and  the carriage of his shoulders showed him a soldier, but he had a pair  of those peculiar frank and piercing blue eyes which are more common in  sailors. His face was somewhat square, his jaw was square, his shoulders  were square, even his jacket was square. Indeed, in the wild school  of caricature then current, Mr Max Beerbohm had represented him as a  proposition in the fourth book of Euclid.    For he also was a public man, though with quite another sort of success.  You did not have to be in the best society to have heard of Captain  Cutler, of the siege of Hong-Kong, and the great march across China. You  could not get away from hearing of him wherever you were; his portrait  was on every other postcard; his maps and battles in every other  illustrated paper; songs in his honour in every other music-hall turn or  on every other barrel-organ. His fame, though probably more temporary,  was ten times more wide, popular and spontaneous than the other man's.  In thousands of English homes he appeared enormous above England, like  Nelson. Yet he had infinitely less power in England than Sir Wilson  Seymour.    The door was opened to them by an aged servant or \"dresser\", whose  broken-down face and figure and black shabby coat and trousers  contrasted queerly with the glittering interior of the great actress's  dressing-room. It was fitted and filled with looking-glasses at every  angle of refraction, so that they looked like the hundred facets of one  huge diamond--if one could get inside a diamond. The other features of  luxury, a few flowers, a few coloured cushions, a few scraps of stage  costume, were multiplied by all the mirrors into the madness of the  Arabian Nights, and danced and changed places perpetually as the  shuffling attendant shifted a mirror outwards or shot one back against  the wall.    They both spoke to the dingy dresser by name, calling him Parkinson, and  asking for the lady as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22305"],[0,"The Naval History of the United States.

The incident of the destruction of the tea in Boston Harbor was the  last of the petty incidents that led up to the American Revolution.  Following quick upon it came Lexington, Concord, and Bunker  Hill,--then the great conflict was fairly under way, and the Colonies  were fighting for liberty. What part the sailors of the colonies took  in that struggle, it is the purpose of this book to recount.          CHAPTER IV.         THE BEGINNING OF THE NAVY. -- LEXINGTON AND CONCORD. -- A       BLOW STRUCK IN MAINE. -- CAPTURE OF THE \"MARGARETTA.\" --       GEN. WASHINGTON AND THE NAVY. -- WORK OF CAPT. MANLY.      In treating of the history of the navy during the war of the  Revolution, we must always bear in mind the fact, that, during the  greater part of that war, there was no navy. Indeed, the subject  presents much the same aspect as the celebrated chapter on snakes in  Ireland, which consisted of exactly six words, \"There are no snakes in  Ireland.\" So many of the episodes and incidents of the Revolutionary  war that we chronicle as part of the naval history of that struggle  are naval only in that they took place on the water. The participants  in them were often longshoremen, fishermen, or privateersmen, and but  seldom sailors enrolled in the regular navy of the united colonies.  Nevertheless, these irregular forces accomplished some results that  would be creditable to a navy in the highest state of efficiency and  discipline.    The expense of building vessels-of-war, and the difficulty, amounting  even to impossibility, of procuring cannon for their armament,  deterred the Colonies from equipping a naval force. All the energies  of the revolutionists were directed towards organizing and equipping  the army. The cause of independence upon the ocean was left to shift  for itself. But, as the war spread, the depredations of British  vessels along the coast became so intolerable that some colonies  fitted out armed vessels for self-protection. Private enterprise sent  out many privateers to prey upon British commerce, so that the  opening months of the year 1776 saw many vessels on the ocean to  support the cause of the Colonies. To man these vessels, there were  plenty of sailors; for even at that early day New England had begun to  develop that race of hardy seamen for which she is still noted in this  day of decadence in the American marine. There was, however, a sad  lack of trained officers to command the vessels of the infant navy.  Many Americans were enrolled on the lists of the ships flying the  royal banner of England, but most of these remained in the British  service. The men, therefore, who were to command the ships of the  colonies, were trained in the rough school of the merchant service,  and had smelt gunpowder only when resisting piratical attacks, or in  serving themselves as privateers.    For these reasons the encounters and exploits that we shall consider  as being part of the naval operations of the Revolutionary war were of  a kind that would to-day be regarded as insignificant skirmishes; and  the naval officer of to-day would look with supreme contempt upon most  of his brethren of '76, as so many untrained sea-guerillas.  Nevertheless, the achievements of some of the seamen of the Revolution  are not insignificant, even when compared with exploits of the era of  Farragut; and it must be remembered that the efforts of the devoted  men were directed against a nation that had in commission at the  opening of the war three hundred and fifty-three vessels, and even  then bore proudly the title conferred upon her by the consent of all  nations,--\"The Mistress of the Seas.\"    It was on the 19th of April, 1775, that the redoubtable Major Pitcairn  and his corps of scarlet-coated British regulars shot down the  colonists on the green at Lexington, and then fled back to Boston  followed by the enraged minute-men, who harassed the retreating  redcoats with a constant fire of musketry. The news of the battle  spread far and wide; and wherever the story was told, the colonists  began arming themselves, and preparing for resistance to the  continually increasing despotism of the British authorities.    On the 9th of May, a coasting schooner from Boston put into the little  seaport of Machias on the coast of Maine. The people of the little  town gathered at the wharf, and from the sailors first heard the story  of Lexington and Concord. The yoke of the British Government had  rested lightly on the shoulders of the people of Machias. Far from  the chief cities of the New World, they had heard little of the  continued dissensions between the Colonies and the home Government,  and they heard the story of the rebellion with amazement. But however  unprepared they might have been for the news of the outbreak, their  sympathies went warmly out to their struggling brethren, and they  determined to place themselves shoulder to shoulder with the  Massachusetts colonists in the fight against the oppression of the  British. Their opportunity for action came that very night.    As the sturdy young colonists stood on the deck listening to the  stories of the newly arrived sailors, they could see floating lightly  at anchor near the wharf a trimly rigged schooner flying the ensign of  the British navy. This craft was the \"Margaretta,\" an armed schooner  acting as convoy to two sloops that were then loading with ship-timber  to be used in the service of the king.    The Boston sailors had not yet finished their narrative of the two  battles, when the thought occurred to some of the adventurous  listeners that they might strike a retaliatory blow by capturing the  \"Margaretta.\" Therefore, bidding the sailors to say nothing to the  British of Lexington and Concord, they left the wharf and dispersed  through the town, seeking for recruits. That same evening, sixty  stalwart men assembled in a secluded farm-house, and laid their plans  for the destruction of the schooner. It was then Saturday night, and  the conspirators determined to attack the vessel the next morning  while the officers were at church. All were to proceed by twos and  threes to the wharf, in order that no suspicion might be aroused. Once  at the water-side, they would rush to their boats, and carry the  schooner by boarding.    Sunday morning dawned clear, and all seemed propitious for the  conspirators. The \"Margaretta\" had then been in port for more than a  week, and her officers had no reason to doubt the loyalty and  friendship of the inhabitants: no whisper of the occurrences in  Massachusetts, nor any hint of the purposes of the people of Machias,  had reached their ears. Therefore, on this peaceful May morning, Capt.  Moore donned his full-dress uniform, and with his brother officers  proceeded to the little church in the village.    Every thing then seemed favorable to the success of the adventure.  The \"Margaretta,\" manned by a sleepy crew, and deserted by her  officers, lay within easy distance of the shore. It seemed as though  the conspirators had only to divide into two parties; and while the  one surrounded the church, and captured the worshipping officers, the  others might descend upon the schooner, and easily make themselves  masters of all.    But the plot failed. History fails to record just how or why the  suspicions of Capt. Moore were aroused. Whether it was that the wary  captain noticed the absence of most of the young men of the  congregation, or whether he saw the conspirators assembling on the  dock, is not known. But certain it is that the good dominie in the  pulpit, and the pious people in the pews, were mightily startled by  the sudden uprisal of Capt. Moore, who sprang from his seat, and,  calling upon his officers to follow him, leaped through the great  window of the church, and ran like mad for the shore, followed by the  rest of the naval party.    There was no more church for the good people of Machias that morning.  Even the preacher came down from his pulpit to stare through his  horn-rimmed glasses at the retreating forms of his whilom listeners.  And, as he stood in blank amazement at the church door, he saw a large  party of the missing young men of his congregation come dashing down  the street in hot pursuit of the retreating mariners. In their hands,  the pursuers carried sabres, cutlasses, old flint-lock muskets,  cumbrous horse-pistols, scythes, and reaping-hooks. The pursued wore  no arms; and, as no boat awaited them at the shore, their case looked  hopeless indeed. But the old salt left in charge of the schooner was  equal to the occasion. The unsabbath-like tumult on the shore quickly  attracted his attention, and with unfeigned astonishment he had  observed his commander's unseemly egress from the church. But, when  the armed band of colonists appeared upon the scene, he ceased to rub  his eyes in wonder, and quickly loaded up a swivel gun, with which he  let fly, over the heads of his officers, and in dangerous proximity to  the advancing colonists. This fire checked the advance of the  conspirators; and, while they wavered and hung back, a boat put off  from the schooner, and soon took the officers aboard. Then, after  firing a few solid shot over the town, merely as an admonition of what  might be expected if the hot-headed young men persisted in their  violent outbreaks, the \"Margaretta\" dropped down the bay to a more  secluded anchorage.    The defeated conspirators were vastly chagrined at the miscarriage of  their plot; but, nothing daunted, they resolved to attempt to carry  the schooner by assault, since strategy had failed. Therefore, early  the next morning, four young men seized upon a sloop, and, bringing  her up to the wharf, cheered lustily. A crowd soon gathered, and the  project was explained, and volunteers called for. Thirty-five hardy  sailors and woodmen hastily armed"]]]
