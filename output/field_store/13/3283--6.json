The preservative in part replaces the alcohol and the hop extract,  and shortens the brewing time. The preservatives mostly used are the  bisulphites of lime and potash, and these, when employed in small  quantities, are generally held to be harmless.    BREWING OPERATIONS.--The general scheme of operations in an English brewery  will be readily understood if reference be made to fig. 1, which represents  an 8-quarter brewery on the _gravitation system_, the principle of which is  that all materials to be employed are pumped or hoisted to the highest  point required, to start with, and that subsequently no further pumping or  hoisting is required, the materials (in the shape of water, malt, wort or  hops, &c.) being conveyed from one point to another by the force of  gravity.    The malt, which is hoisted to the top floor, after cleaning and grading is  conveyed to the _Malt Mill_, where it is crushed. Thence the ground malt,  or \"grist\" as it is now called, passes to the _Grist Hopper_, and from the  latter to the _Mashing Machine_, in which it is intimately mixed with hot  water from the _Hot Liquor Vessel_. From the mashing machine the mixed  grist and \"liquor\" pass to the _Mash-Tun_, where the starch of the malt is  rendered soluble. From the mash-tun the clear wort passes to the _Copper_,  where it is boiled with hops. From the copper the boiled wort passes to the  _Hop Back_, where the insoluble hop constituents are separated from the  wort. From the hop back the wort passes to the _Cooler_, from the latter to  the _Refrigerator_, thence (for the purpose of enabling the revenue  officers to assess the duty) to the _Collecting Vessel_,[4] and finally to  the _Fermenting Vessels_, in which the wort is transformed into \"green\"  beer. The latter is then cleansed, and finally racked and stored.    It will be seen from the above that brewing consists of seven distinct main  processes, which may be classed as follows: (1) Grinding; (2) Mashing; (3)  Boiling; (4) Cooling; (5) Fermenting; (6) Cleansing; (7) Racking and  Storing.    _Grinding_.--In most modern breweries the malt passes, on its way [v.04  p.0509] from the bins to the mill, through a cleaning and grading  apparatus, and then through an automatic measuring machine. The mills,  which exist in a variety of designs, are of the smooth roller type, and are  so arranged that the malt is _crushed_ rather than ground. If the malt is  ground too fine, difficulties arise in regard to efficient drainage in the  mash-tun and subsequent clarification. On the other hand, if the crushing  is too coarse the subsequent extraction of soluble matter in the mash-tun  is incomplete, and an inadequate yield results.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--An 8-quarter Brewery (Messrs. L. Lumley & Co.,  Ltd.).]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Mash-tun with mashing machine.]    _Mashing_ is a process which consists mainly in extracting, by means of  water at an adequate temperature, the soluble matters pre-existent in the  malt, and in converting the insoluble starch and a great part of the  insoluble nitrogenous compounds into soluble and partly fermentable  products. Mashing is, without a doubt, the most important of the brewing  processes, for it is largely in the mash-tun that the character of the beer  to be brewed is determined. In modern practice the malt and the mashing  \"liquor\" (_i.e._ water) are introduced into the mash-tun simultaneously, by  means of the mashing machine (fig. 2, A). This is generally a cylindrical  metal vessel, commanding the mash-tun and provided with a central shaft and  screw. The grist (as the crushed malt is called) enters the mashing machine  from the grist case above, and the liquor is introduced at the back. The  screw is rotated rapidly, and so a thorough mixture of the grist and liquor  takes place as they travel along the mashing machine. The mash-tun (fig. 2)  is a large metal or wooden vessel, fitted with a false bottom composed of  plates perforated with numerous small holes or slits (C). This arrangement  is necessary in order to obtain a proper separation of the \"wort\" (as the  liquid portion of the finished mash is called) from the spent grains. The  mash-tun is also provided with a stirring apparatus (the _rakes_) so that  the grist and liquor may be intimately mixed (D), and an automatic  sprinkler, the _sparger_ (fig. 2, B, and fig. 3), which is employed in  order to wash out the wort remaining in the grains. The sparger consists of  a number of hollow arms radiating from a common centre and pierced by a  number of small perforations. The common central vessel from which the  sparge-arms radiate is mounted in such a manner that it rotates  automatically when a stream of water is admitted, so that a constant fine  spray covers the whole tun when the sparger is in operation. There are also  pipes for admitting \"liquor\" to the bottom of the tun, and for carrying the  wort from the latter to the \"underback\" or \"copper.\"    The grist and liquor having been introduced into the tun (either by means  of the mashing machine or separately), the rakes are set going, so that the  mash may become thoroughly homogeneous, and after a short time the rakes  are stopped and the mash allowed to rest, usually for a period of about two  hours. After this, \"taps are set\"--_i.e._ communication is established  between the mash-tun and the vessel into which the wort runs--and the  sparger is started. In this manner the whole of the wort or extract is  separated from the grains. The quantity of water employed is, in all, from  two to three barrels to the quarter (336 lb) of malt.    In considering the process of mashing, one might almost say the process of  brewing, it is essential to remember that the type and quality of the beer  to be produced (see MALT) depends almost entirely (a) on the kind of malt  employed, and (b) on the mashing temperature. In other words, quality may  be controlled on the kiln or in the mash-tun, or both. Viewed in this  light, the following theoretical methods for preparing different types of  beer are possible:--(1) high kiln heats and high mashing temperatures; (2)  high kiln heats and low mashing temperatures; (3) low kiln heats and high  mashing temperatures; and (4) low kiln heats and low mashing temperatures.  In practice all these combinations, together with many intermediate ones,  are met with, and it is not too much to say that the whole science of  modern brewing is based upon them. It is plain, then, that the mashing  temperature will depend on the kind of beer that is to be produced, and on  the kind of malt employed. For stouts and black beers generally, a mashing  temperature of 148 deg. to 150 deg. F. is most usual; for pale or stock ales, 150 deg.  to 154 deg. F.; and for mild running beers, 154 deg. to 149 deg. F. The range of  temperatures employed in brewing English beers is a very limited one as  compared with foreign mashing methods, and does not range further,  practically speaking, than from 140 deg. to 160 deg. F. The effect of higher  temperatures is chiefly to cripple the enzyme or \"ferment\" diastase, which,  as already said, is the agent which converts the insoluble starch into  soluble dextrin, sugar and intermediate products. The higher the mashing  temperature, the more the diastase will be crippled in its action, and the  more dextrinous (non-fermentable) matter as compared with maltose  (fermentable sugar) will be formed. A pale or stock ale, which is a type of  beer that must be \"dry\" and that will keep, requires to contain a  relatively high proportion of dextrin and little maltose, and, in its  preparation, therefore, a high mashing temperature will be employed. On the  other hand, a mild running ale, which is a full, sweet beer, intended for  rapid consumption, will be obtained by means of low mashing temperatures,  which produce relatively little dextrin, but a good deal of maltose, _i.e._  sweet and readily fermentable matter.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Sparger.]    Diastase is not the only enzyme present in malt. There is also a ferment  which renders a part of the nitrogenous matter soluble. This again is  affected by temperature in much the same way as diastase. Low heats tend to  produce much non-coagulable [v.04 p.0510] nitrogenous matter, which is  undesirable in a stock beer, as it tends to produce fret and side  fermentations. With regard to the kind of malt and other materials employed  in producing various types of beer, pale ales are made either from pale  malt (generally a mixture of English and fine foreign, such as Smyrna,  California) only, or from pale malt and a little flaked maize, rice, invert  sugar or glucose. Running beers (mild ale) are made from a mixture of pale  and amber malts, sugar and flaked goods; stout, from a mixture of pale,  amber and roasted (black) malts only, or with the addition of a little  sugar or flaked maize.    When raw grain is employed, the process of mashing is slightly modified.  The maize, rice or other grain is usually gelatinized in a vessel (called a  _converter_ or _cooker_) entirely separated from the mash-tun, by means of  steam at a relatively high temperature, mostly with, but occasionally  without, the addition of some malt meal. After about half an hour the  gelatinized mass is mixed with the main mash, and this takes place shortly  before taps are set. This is possible inasmuch as the starch, being already  in a highly disintegrated condition, is very rapidly converted. By working  on the limited-decoction system (see below), it is possible to make use of  a fair percentage of raw grain in the mash-tun proper, thus doing away with  the \"converter\" entirely.    _The Filter Press Process._--The ordinary mash-tun process, as described  above, possesses"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19706"],[0,"Brood of the Witch-Queen (#11)"],[1,"your favour thus far, but a recurrence is to be  anticipated at any time. Be good enough to look upon me as a  specialist, and give me all your confidence.\"    Lashmore cleared his throat.    \"What do you wish to know, Dr. Cairn?\" he asked, with a queer  intermingling of respect and hauteur in his tones.    \"I wish to know about Mirza, wife of the third Baron Lashmore.\"    Lord Lashmore took a stride forward. His large hands clenched, and his  eyes were blazing.    \"What do you know about her?\"    Surprise was in his voice, and anger.    \"I have seen her portrait in Dhoon Castle; you were not in residence  at the time. Mirza, Lady Lashmore, was evidently a very beautiful  woman. What was the date of the marriage?\"    \"1615.\"    \"The third Baron brought her to England from?--\"    \"Poland.\"    \"She was a Pole?\"    \"A Polish Jewess.\"    \"There was no issue of the marriage, but the Baron outlived her and  married again?\"    Lord Lashmore shifted his feet nervously, and gnawed his finger-nails.    \"There _was_ issue of the marriage,\" he snapped. \"She was--my  ancestress.\"    \"Ah!\" Dr. Cairn's grey eyes lighted up momentarily. \"We get to the  facts! Why was this birth kept secret?\"    \"Dhoon Castle has kept many secrets!\" It was a grim noble of the  Middle Ages who was speaking. \"For a Lashmore, there was no difficulty  in suppressing the facts, arranging a hasty second marriage and  representing the boy as the child of the later union. Had the second  marriage proved fruitful, this had been unnecessary; but an heir to  Dhoon was--essential.\"    \"I see. Had the second marriage proved fruitful, the child of Mirza  would have been--what shall we say?--smothered?\"    \"Damn it! What do you mean?\"    \"He was the rightful heir.\"    \"Dr. Cairn,\" said Lashmore slowly, \"you are probing an open wound. The  fourth Baron Lashmore represents what the world calls 'The Curse of  the House of Dhoon.' At Dhoon Castle there is a secret chamber, which  has engaged the pens of many so-called occultists, but which no man,  save every heir, has entered for generations. It's very location is a  secret. Measurements do not avail to find it. You would appear to know  much of my family's black secret; perhaps you know where that room  lies at Dhoon?\"    \"Certainly, I do,\" replied Dr. Cairn calmly; \"it is under the moat,  some thirty yards west of the former drawbridge.\"    Lord Lashmore changed colour. When he spoke again his voice had lost  its _timbre_.    \"Perhaps you know--what it contains.\"    \"I do. It contains Paul, fourth Baron Lashmore, son of Mirza, the  Polish Jewess!\"    Lord Lashmore reseated himself in the big armchair, staring at the  speaker, aghast.    \"I thought no other in the world knew that!\" he said, hollowly. \"Your  studies have been extensive indeed. For three years--three whole years  from the night of my twenty-first birthday--the horror hung over me,  Dr. Cairn. It ultimately brought my grandfather to the madhouse, but  my father was of sterner stuff, and so, it seems, was I. After those  three years of horror I threw off the memories of Paul Dhoon, the  third baron--\"    \"It was on the night of your twenty-first birthday that you were  admitted to the subterranean room?\"    \"You know so much, Dr. Cairn, that you may as well know all.\"  Lashmore's face was twitching. \"But you are about to hear what no man  has ever heard from the lips of one of my family before.\"    He stood up again, restlessly.    \"Nearly thirty-five years have elapsed,\" he resumed, \"since that  December night; but my very soul trembles now, when I recall it! There  was a big house-party at Dhoon, but I had been prepared, for some  weeks, by my father, for the ordeal that awaited me. Our family  mystery is historical, and there were many fearful glances bestowed  upon me, when, at midnight, my father took me aside from the company  and led me to the old library. By God! Dr. Cairn--fearful as these  reminiscences are, it is a relief to relate them--to _someone_!\"    A sort of suppressed excitement was upon Lashmore, but his voice  remained low and hollow.    \"He asked me,\" he continued, \"the traditional question: if I had  prayed for strength. God knows I had! Then, his stern face very pale,  he locked the library door, and from a closet concealed beside the  ancient fireplace--a closet which, hitherto, I had not known to  exist--he took out a bulky key of antique workmanship. Together we set  to work to remove all the volumes from one of the bookshelves.    \"Even when the shelves were empty, it called for our united efforts to  move the heavy piece of furniture; but we accomplished the task  ultimately, making visible a considerable expanse of panelling. Nearly  forty years had elapsed since that case had been removed, and the  carvings which it concealed were coated with all the dust which had  accumulated there since the night of my father's coming of age.    \"A device upon the top of the centre panel represented the arms of the  family; the helm which formed part of the device projected like a  knob. My father grasped it, turned it, and threw his weight against  the seemingly solid wall. It yielded, swinging inward upon concealed  hinges, and a damp, earthy smell came out into the library. Taking up  a lamp, which he had in readiness, my father entered the cavity,  beckoning me to follow.    \"I found myself descending a flight of rough steps, and the roof above  me was so low that I was compelled to stoop. A corner was come to,  passed, and a further flight of steps appeared beneath. At that time  the old moat was still flooded, and even had I not divined as much  from the direction of the steps, I should have known, at this point,  that we were beneath it. Between the stone blocks roofing us in oozed  drops of moisture, and the air was at once damp and icily cold.    \"A short passage, commencing at the foot of the steps, terminated  before a massive, iron-studded door. My father placed the key in the  lock, and holding the lamp above his head, turned and looked at me. He  was deathly pale.    \"'Summon all your fortitude,' he said.    \"He strove to turn the key, but for a long time without success for  the lock was rusty. Finally, however--he was a strong man--his efforts  were successful. The door opened, and an indescribable smell came out  into the passage. Never before had I met with anything like it; I have  never met with it since.\"    Lord Lashmore wiped his brow with his handkerchief.    \"The first thing,\" he resumed, \"upon which the lamplight shone, was  what appeared to be a blood-stain spreading almost entirely over one  wall of the cell which I perceived before me. I have learnt since that  this was a species of fungus, not altogether uncommon, but at the  time, and in that situation, it shocked me inexpressibly.    \"But let me hasten to that which we were come to see--let me finish  my story as quickly as may be. My father halted at the entrance to  this frightful cell; his hand, with which he held the lamp above his  head, was not steady; and over his shoulder I looked into the place  and saw ... _him_.    \"Dr. Cairn, for three years, night and day, that spectacle haunted me;  for three years, night and day, I seemed to have before my eyes the  dreadful face--the bearded, grinning face of Paul Dhoon. He lay there  upon the floor of the dungeon, his fists clenched and his knees drawn  up as if in agony. He had lain there for generations; yet, as God is  my witness, there was flesh on his bones.    \"Yellow and seared it was, and his joints protruded through it, but  his features were yet recognisable--horribly, dreadfully,  recognisable. His black hair was like a mane, long and matted, his  eyebrows were incredibly heavy and his lashes overhung his cheekbones.  The nails of his fingers ... no! I will spare you! But his teeth, his  ivory gleaming teeth--with the two wolf-fangs fully revealed by that  death-grin!...    \"An aspen stake was driven through his breast, pinning him to the  earthern floor, and there he lay in the agonised attitude of one who  had died by such awful means. Yet--that stake was not driven through  his unhallowed body until a whole year after his death!    \"How I regained the library I do not remember. I was unable to rejoin  the guests, unable to face my fellow-men for days afterwards. Dr.  Cairn, for three years I feared--feared the world--feared  sleep--feared myself above all; for I knew that I had in my veins the  blood of a _vampire_!\"          CHAPTER IX    THE POLISH JEWESS      There was a silence of some minutes' duration. Lord Lashmore sat  staring straight before him, his fists clenched upon his knees. Then:    \"It was after death that the third baron developed--certain  qualities?\" inquired Dr. Cairn.    \"There were six cases of death in the district within twelve months,\"  replied Lashmore. \"The gruesome cry of 'vampire' ran through the  community. The fourth baron--son of Paul Dhoon--turned a deaf ear to  these reports, until the mother of a child--a child who had  died--traced a man, or the semblance of a man, to the gate of the  Dhoon family vault. By night, secretly, the son of Paul Dhoon visited  the vault, and found....    \"The body, which despite twelve months in the tomb, looked as it had  looked in life, was carried to the dungeon--in the Middle Ages a  torture-room; no cry uttered there can reach the outer world--and was  submitted to the ancient process for slaying a vampire. From that hour  no supernatural visitant has troubled the district; but--\"    \"But,\" said Dr. Cairn quietly, \"the strain came from Mirza, the  sorceress. What of her?\"    Lord Lashmore's eyes shone feverishly.    \"How do you know that she was a sorceress?\" he asked, hoarsely. \"These  are family secrets.\"    \"They will remain so,\" Dr. Cairn answered. \"But my studies have gone  far, and I know that Mirza, wife of the third Baron Lashmore,  practised the Black Art in life, and became after death a ghoul.
