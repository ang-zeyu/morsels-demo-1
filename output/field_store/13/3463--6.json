There was apparently no way out of this pit except by the opening at the  top, through which a bit of sky could be seen; and Aristomenes soon  found that the sides were so steep that it was impossible to reach the  opening. He therefore went off to one side, away from the heap of dead,  and sat down on a stone in that cold, damp, and dark place. There he  drew his cloak over his head to wait patiently until he should starve to  death. Three days had thus been spent in this place, and his strength  was already fast failing, when he suddenly felt a warm breath on his  hand.    He softly drew aside his cloak, and, now that his eyes were used to the  darkness, he dimly saw a fox prowling around him, and sniffing his  clothes suspiciously.    Gently wrapping his cloak around his hand to protect it from the fox's  sharp teeth, Aristomenes caught the animal firmly by the tail. Then, in  spite of all its efforts to get away, he held it tight; and when it  started off, he followed its lead.    As he had shrewdly suspected, the fox knew a way out of the horrible  place. All at once it slipped into a hole; and Aristomenes, seeing a  little light at the end of this, let the fox go. With the help of a  sharp stone, he soon made the fox's hole big enough to crawl through,  and quickly made his way back to the Messenians.    You can imagine how happy they were to see the beloved chief whom they  thought dead, and how tenderly they cared for him until he was well and  strong again. They never tired of hearing the story of his fall,  imprisonment, and escape; and when he proposed to lead them once more  against the Spartans, they gladly promised to help him.    In spite of all Aristomenes' courage, however, Messenia finally fell  into the hands of the Spartans, and the Second Messenian War came to an  end. All the people who wished to escape slavery or death left their  native country, and went to Italy or Sicily, where they founded Greek  colonies.    The cities that they built soon became very powerful, and one of them  they named Mes-si'na in honor of their native land. This city still  stands, as you will see by looking at your maps; and near it is the  strait of the same name, which separates Sicily from Italy.          XXIX. THE OLYMPIC GAMES.      Northwest of Sparta, in the country called E'lis and in the city of  O-lym'pi-a, rose a beautiful temple for the worship of Ju'pi-ter (or  Zeus), the principal god of the Greeks. This temple was said to have  been built by Hercules, the great hero from whom, as you remember, all  the Heraclidae claimed to be descended.    According to the legends, Hercules was a son of the god Jupiter, and had  ordered that a great festival should be held here every four years in  honor of his divine father.    [Illustration: The Temple at Olympia.]    For the purpose of attracting all the neighboring people to the temple  at Olympia, Hercules founded many athletic games, such as wrestling,  stone and spear throwing, foot, horse, and chariot races, boxing,  swimming, and the like.    Hercules himself was present at the first of these festivals, and acted  as umpire of the games, rewarding the victors by giving them crowns of  wild olive leaves. This custom had been kept up ever since, and the  Greek youths considered this simple crown the finest prize which could  be given.    As the Spartans were great athletes, they soon took important parts in  the Olympic games, won most of the prizes, and claimed the honor of  defending the temple at Olympia in all times of danger.    All the people who went to Olympia to witness the games laid some  precious offering before the shrines, so that the temple came to be  noted for its beauty and wealth. Painters and sculptors, too, further  adorned it with samples of their skill, and it soon contained numerous  gems of art.    The most precious of all was a statue representing Jupiter, which was  the work of the renowned sculptor Phid'i-as. This statue was more than  forty feet high; and, while the god himself was carved out of pure white  ivory, his hair, beard, and garments were made of gold, and his eyes of  the brightest jewels.    The temple and grove were further adorned with a great many statues  representing the other gods and all the prize winners, for it was  customary to place a life-sized statue of each of them in this beautiful  place.    During the celebration of the Olympic games many sacrifices were offered  up to the gods, and there were many religious processions in their  honor. Poets and artists, as well as athletes, were in the habit of  hastening thither on every occasion; for there were contests in poetry  and song, and the people were anxious to hear and see all the new  works.    Between the games, therefore, the poets recited their poems, the  musicians sang their songs, the historians read their histories, and the  story-tellers told their choicest tales, to amuse the vast crowd which  had come there from all parts of Greece, and even from the shores of  Italy and Asia Minor.    As the games were held every four years, the people eagerly looked  forward to their coming, and soon began to reckon time by them. It was  therefore usual to say that such and such a thing happened in the first,  second, or third year of the fifth, tenth, or seventieth O-lym'pi-ad, as  the case might be.    Soon even the historians began to use this way of dating important  events; and by counting four years for each Olympiad, as the time  between the games was called, we can find out exactly when the chief  events in Greek history took place.    Although the Olympic games were probably held many times before this  system of counting was begun, and before any good record was kept, we  can trace them back to 774 B.C.    For one thousand years after that, the name of each victor was carefully  written down; and it was only about three centuries after Christ that  the Olympic records ceased. Then the games came to an end, to the sorrow  of all the Greeks.    Several attempts have since been made to revive these games; but all  proved fruitless until the Greek king arranged to renew them in 1896. In  that year a great festival was held, not at Olympia, but in the city of  Athens.    Besides some of the old-fashioned Greek games, there were bicycle and  hurdle races, shooting matches, and contests in jumping. People from all  parts of the world went to see them in as large numbers as they went to  Olympia in the olden times.    The victors in the games, who belonged to many different nations,  received medals, and wreaths of wild olive and laurel leaves; but the  people did not wear crowns of flowers as formerly, nor offer sacrifices  to the old gods, for Greece is now a Christian country.          XXX. MILO OF CROTON.      Among the athletes whose statues were to be seen at Olympia was Mi'lo, a  man of Cro'ton, one of the Greek colonies in Italy. This man was  remarkable for his great strength, and could carry very heavy weights.  In order to develop his muscle and become strong, he had trained himself  from a boy, and had practiced carrying burdens until he could lift more  than any other man of his time.    We are told that he was so earnest in his efforts to become strong, that  he daily carried a pet calf, gradually increasing the distance. As the  calf grew larger, Milo became stronger, and his muscles became so  powerful that he could carry the animal with ease when it became a  full-sized ox.    To please his companions and show them what he could do, Milo once  carried an ox for several miles, and then, feeling hungry, killed it  with one blow of his fist, cooked it, and ate it all at a single meal.  On another occasion, Milo was sitting with several companions in a  rather tumble-down house. All at once he noticed that the roof was  falling in. He stretched up his great arms, spread out his hands, and  held the roof up until all his companions had run out of the house.    Milo's hands were so strong that when he seized a chariot, even with one  hand only, four horses could not make it stir until he let it go. Of  course, Milo was very proud of his great strength, which, however,  proved unlucky for him, and caused his death.    One day when he was very old, Milo wandered out alone into a forest  where some woodcutters had been at work. The men had gone away, leaving  their wedges in an unusually large tree trunk.    Milo, remembering his former strength, gazed for a moment at the tree,  and then, feeling sure that he could easily pull it apart, he slipped  his fingers into the crack. At his first effort the tree parted a  little, and the wedges fell out; but the two halves, instead of  splitting apart, suddenly came together again, and Milo found his hands  held fast.    In vain he struggled, in vain he called. He could neither wrench himself  free nor attract any one's attention. Night came on, and soon the wild  beasts of the forest began to creep out of their dens.    They found the captive athlete, and, springing upon him, tore him to  pieces, for he could not defend himself, in spite of all his boasted  strength.          XXXI. THE JEALOUS ATHLETE.      Near the statue of Milo of Croton stood that of The-ag'e-nes, another  noted athlete, who lived many years after Milo. He too had defeated  every rival. He was the winner of many prizes, and all envied him his  strength and renown.    One of the men in particular, whom he had defeated in the games, was  jealous of him, and of the honors which he had won. This man, instead of  trying to overcome these wicked feelings, used to steal daily into the  temple to view his rival's statue, and mutter threats and curses against  it.    In his anger, he also gave the pedestal an angry shake every night,  hoping that some harm would befall the statue. One evening, when this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],[0,"The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#11)"],[1,"   We had hardly recovered from this pleasant little bit of excitement,  when the guide Ike, who rode in the advance, was seen suddenly to jerk  up, exclaiming--    \"Painter, by God!  I know'd I heard a painter.\"    \"Where? where?\" was hurriedly uttered by several voices, while all  pressed forward to the guide.    \"Yander!\" replied Ike, pointing to a thicket of young beeches.  \"He's  tuk to the brush: ride round, fellers.  Mark, boy, round! quick, damn  you!\"    There was a scramble of horsemen, with excited, anxious looks and  gestures.  Every one had his gun cocked and ready, and in a few seconds  the small copse of beeches, with their golden-yellow leaves, was  inclosed by a ring of hunters.  Had the cougar got away, or was he still  within the thicket?  Several large trees grew out of its midst.  Had he  taken to one?  The eyes of the party were turned upwards.  The fierce  creature was nowhere visible.    It was impossible to see into every part of the jungle from the outside,  as we sat in our saddles.  The game might be crouching among the grass  and brambles.  What was to be done?  We had no dogs.  How was the cougar  to be started?  It would be no small peril to penetrate the thicket  afoot.  Who was to do it?    The question was answered by Redwood, who was now seen dismounting from  his horse.    \"Keep your eyes about you,\" cried he.  \"I'll make the varmint show if  he's thur.  Look sharp, then!\"    We saw Redwood enter fearlessly, leaving his horse hitched over a  branch.  We heard him no longer, as he proceeded with that stealthy  silence known only to the Indian fighter.  We listened, and waited in  profound suspense.  Not even the crackling of a branch broke the  stillness.  Full five minutes we waited, and then the sharp crack of a  rifle near the centre of the copsewood relieved, us.  The next moment  was heard Redwood's voice crying aloud--    \"Look out thur?  By God!  I've missed him.\"    Before we had time to change our attitudes another rifle cracked, and  another voice was heard, crying in answer to Redwood--    \"But, by God!  I hain't.\"    \"He's hyur,\" continued the voice; \"dead as mutton.  Come this a way, an'  yu'll see the beauty.\"    Ike's voice was recognised, and we all galloped to the spot where it  proceeded from.  At his feet lay the body of the panther quite dead.  There was a red spot running blood between the ribs, where Ike's bullet  had penetrated.  In trying to escape from the thicket, the cougar had  halted a moment, in a crouching attitude, directly before Ike's face,  and that moment was enough to give the trapper time to glance through  his sights, and send the fatal bullet.    Of course the guide received the congratulations of all, and though he  pretended not to regard the thing in the light of a feat, he knew well  that killing a \"painter\" was no everyday adventure.    The skin of the animal was stripped off in a trice, and carried to the  waggon.  Such a trophy is rarely left in the woods.    The hunter-naturalist performed some farther operations upon the body  for the purpose of examining the contents of the stomach.  These  consisted entirely of the half-digested remains of passenger-pigeons, an  enormous quantity of which the beast had devoured during the previous  night--having captured them no doubt upon the trees.    This adventure formed a pleasant theme for conversation during the rest  of our journey, and of course the cougar was the subject.  His habits  and history were fully discussed, and the information elicited is given  below.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    THE COUGAR.    The cougar (_Felis concolor_) is the only indigenous long-tailed cat in  America north of the parallel of 30 degrees.  The \"wild cats\" so called,  are lynxes with short tails; and of these there are three distinct  species.  But there is only one true representative of the genus Felis,  and that is the animal in question.    This has received many trivial appellations.  Among Anglo-American  hunters, it is called the panther--in their _patois_, \"painter.\"  In  most parts of South America, as well as in Mexico, it receives the  grandiloquent title of \"lion\" (_leon_), and in the Peruvian countries is  called the \"puma,\" or \"poma.\"  The absence of stripes, such as those of  the tiger--or spots, as upon the leopard--or rosettes, as upon the  jaguar, have suggested the name of the naturalists, _concolor_.  _Discolor_ was formerly in use; but the other has been generally  adopted.    There are few wild animals so regular in their colour as the cougar:  very little variety has been observed among different specimens.  Some  naturalists speak of spotted cougars--that is, having spots that may be  seen in a certain light.  Upon young cubs, such markings do appear; but  they are no longer visible on the full-grown animal.  The cougar of  mature age is of a tawny red colour, almost uniform over the whole body,  though somewhat paler about the face and the parts underneath.  This  colour is not exactly the tawny of the lion; it is more of a reddish  hue--nearer to what is termed calf-colour.    The cougar is far from being a well-shaped creature: it appears  disproportioned.  Its back is long and hollow; and its tail does not  taper so gracefully as in some other animals of the cat kind.  Its legs  are short and stout; and although far from clumsy in appearance, it does  not possess the graceful _tournure_ of body so characteristic of some of  its congeners.  Though considered the representative of the lion in the  New World, its resemblance to the royal beast is but slight; its colour  seems to be the only title it has to such an honour.  For the rest, it  is much more akin to the tigers, jaguars, and true panthers.  Cougars  are rarely more than six feet in length, including the tail, which is  usually about a third of that measurement.    The range of the animal is very extensive.  It is known from Paraguay to  the Great Lakes of North America.  In no part of either continent is it  to be seen every day, because it is for the most part not only nocturnal  in its activity, but one of those fierce creatures that, fortunately, do  not exist in large numbers.  Like others of the genus, it is solitary in  its habits, and at the approach of civilisation betakes itself to the  remoter parts of the forest.  Hence the cougar, although found in all of  the United States, is a rare animal everywhere, and seen only at long  intervals in the mountain-valleys, or in other difficult places of the  forest.  The appearance of a cougar is sufficient to throw any  neighbourhood into an excitement similar to that which would be produced  by the chase of a mad dog.    It is a splendid tree-climber.  It can mount a tree with the agility of  a cat; and although so large an animal, it climbs by means of its  claws--not by hugging, after the manner of the bears and opossums.  While climbing a tree, its claws can be heard crackling along the bark  as it mounts upward.  It sometimes lies \"squatted\" along a horizontal  branch, a lower one, for the purpose of springing upon deer, or such  other animals as it wishes to prey upon.  The ledge of a cliff is also a  favourite haunt, and such are known among the hunters as  \"panther-ledges.\"  It selects such a position in the neighbourhood of  some watering-place, or, if possible, one of the salt or soda springs  (licks) so numerous in America.  Here it is more certain that its vigil  will not be a protracted one.  Its prey--elk, deer, antelope, or  buffalo--soon appears beneath, unconscious of the dangerous enemy that  cowers over them.  When fairly within reach, the cougar springs, and  pouncing down upon the shoulders of the victim, buries its claws in the  flesh.  The terrified animal starts forward, leaps from side to side,  dashes into the papaw thickets, or breasts the dense cane-brake, in  hopes of brushing off its relentless rider.  All in vain!  Closely  clasping its neck, the cougar clings on, tearing its victim in the  throat, and drinking its blood throughout the wild gallop.  Faint and  feeble, the ruminant at length totters and falls, and the fierce  destroyer squats itself along the body, and finishes its red repast.  If  the cougar can overcome several animals at a time, it will kill them  all, although but the twentieth part may be required to satiate its  hunger.  Unlike the lion in this, even in repletion it will kill.  With  it, destruction of life seems to be an instinct.    There is a very small animal, and apparently a very helpless one, with  which the cougar occasionally quarrels, but often with ill success--this  is the Canada porcupine.  Whether the cougar ever succeeds in killing  one of these creatures is not known, but that it attacks them is beyond  question, and its own death is often the result.  The quills of the  Canada porcupine are slightly barbed at their extremities; and when  stuck into the flesh of a living animal, this arrangement causes them to  penetrate mechanically deeper and deeper as the animal moves.  That the  porcupine can itself discharge them to some distance, is not true, but  it is true that it can cause them to be easily _detached_; and this it  does when rashly seized by any of the predatory animals.  The result is,  that these remarkable spines become fast in the tongue, jaws, and lips  of the cougar, or any other creature which may make an attack on that  seemingly unprotected little animal.  The fisher (_Mustela Canadensis_)  is said to be the only animal that can kill the porcupine with impunity.  It fights the latter by first throwing it upon its back, and then  springing upon its upturned belly, where the spines are almost entirely  wanting.    The cougar is called a cowardly animal: some naturalists even assert  that it will not venture to attack man.  This is, to say the least, a  singular declaration, after the numerous well-attested instances in  which men have been attacked, and even killed by cougars."]]]
