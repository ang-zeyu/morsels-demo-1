[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22523"],[0,"The History of the American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki (#11)"],[1," of September, while the American soldiers were  patrolling the Smolny area, near Archangel proper, this Col. Tschaplin  executed his coup d'etat. He quietly surrounded the homes of Tchaikowsky  and other members of the Archangel State Government and kidnapped them,  hiding them away on an island in the Dvina River.    Great excitement prevailed for several days. The people declared  Tschaplin was moving to restore monarchy under aid of the foreign arms  and declared a strike on the street railroads and threatened to take the  pumping station and the electric power station located at Smolny.  American troops manned the cars and by their good nature and patience  won the respect and confidence of the populace, excited as it was. The  American ambassador, the Hon. David R. Francis, with characteristic  American directness and fairness called the impetuous Tschaplin before  him and gave him so many hours in which to restore the rightful  government to power. And Tchaikowsky came back into the State House on  September 11th much to the rejoicing of the people and to the harmony of  the Allied Expedition. The diplomatic and military authorities of the  American part of the expedition had handled the situation in a way that  prevented riot and gained esteem for Americans in the eyes of all the  Russians.    Archangel, Smolny and Bakaritza now were busy scenes of military  activity. Down the streets of Archangel marched part of a battalion of  doughboys past the State House and the imposing foreign Embassy  Building. Curious eyes looked upon the O. D. uniform and admired the  husky stalwarts from over the seas. Bright-eyed women crowded to the  edge of the boardwalks amongst the long-booted and heavily bewhiskered  men. Well-dressed men with shaven faces and marks of culture studied the  Americans speculatively. Russian children began making acquaintance and  offering their flattering Americanski Dobra.    At Solombola, Smolny, Bakaritza, sounds of firing were heard daily, but  the populace were quieted when told that it was not riot or Bolo attack  but the Americans practising up with their ordnance. In fact the  Americans, hearing of actions at the fronts, were desperately striving  to learn how to use the Lewis guns and the Vickers machine guns. At Camp  Custer they had perfected themselves in handling the Colt and the  Brownings but in England had been obliged to relinquish them with the  dubious prospect of re-equipping with the Russian automatic rifles and  machine gun equipment at Archangel. Now they were feverishly at work on  the new guns for reports were coming back from the front that the enemy  was well equipped with such weapons and held the Americans at great  disadvantage.    Here let it be said that the American doughboy in the North Russian  campaign mastered every kind of weapon that was placed in his hands or  came by fortune of war to his hand. He learned to use the Lewis gun and  the Vickers machine gun of the British and Russian armies, also the  one-pounder, or pom pom. He became proficient in the use of the French  Chauchat automatic rifle and the French machine gun, and their rifle  grenade guns. He learned to use the Stokes mortars with deadly effect on  many a hard-fought line. And during the winter two platoons of \"Hq.\"  Company prided themselves on the mastery of a battery of Russian  artillery patterned after the famous, in fact, the same famous French 75  gun.    While the 2nd Battalion under Major Nichols was establishing itself in  quarters at Smolny, where was a great compound of freshly unloaded  supplies of food, herring and whiskey (do not forget the hard stuff)  and, becoming responsible for the safety of the pumping station and the  electric power station and the ships in the harbor, Captain Taylor  established the big Headquarters Company at Olga barracks at the other  end of the city on September seventh where he could train his men for  the handling of new weapons and could co-operate with Captain Kenyon's  machine gun men. They on the same day took up quarters in Solombola  Barracks and were charged with the duty of not only learning how to use  the new machine guns but to keep guard over the quays and prevent  rioting by the turbulent Russian sailors. Their undying enmity had been  earned by the well-meant but untactful, yes, to the sailors apparently  treacherous, conduct of General Poole toward them on the Russian ships  in the Murmansk when he got them off on a pretext and then seized the  ships to prevent their falling into the hands of the Red Guards. And  while the doughboys on the railroad and Kodish fronts in the fall were  occasionally to run up against the hard-fighting Russian sailors who had  fled south to Petrograd and volunteered their services to Trotsky to go  north and fight the Allied expeditionary forces, these doughboys doing  guard duty in Archangel over the remnants of stores and supplies which  the Bolo had not already stolen or sunk in the Dvina River, were  constantly menaced by these surly, scowling sailors at Solombola and in  Archangel.    Really it is no wonder that the several Allied troop barracks were  always guarded by machine guns and automatics. Rumor at the base always  magnified the action at the front and always fancied riot and uprising  in every group of gesticulating Russkis seen at a dusky corner of the  city.    The Supply Company of the regiment became the supply unit for all the  American forces under Captain Wade and was quartered at Bakaritza, being  protected by various units of Allied forces. \"Finish\" the package of  Russki horse skin and bones which the boys \"skookled\" from the natives,  that is, bought from the natives, became the most familiar sight on the  quays, drawing the strange-looking but cleverly constructed drosky, or  cart, bucking into his collar under the yoke and pulling with all his  sturdy will, not minding the American \"whoa\" but obedient enough when  the doughboy learned to sputter the Russki \"br-r-r br-r-r.\"    Archangel is situated on one of the arms of the Dvina River which deltas  into the White Sea. Out of the enormous interior of North Russia,  gathering up the melted snows of a million square miles of seven-foot  snow and the steady June rains and the weeks of fall rains, the great  Mississippi of North Russia moves down to the sea, sweeping with deep  wide current great volumes of reddish sediment and secretions which give  it the name Dvina. And the arm of the Arctic Ocean into which it carries  its loads of silt and leachings, and upon which it floats the  fishermen's bottoms or the merchantmen's steamers, is called the White  Sea. Rightly named is that sea, the Michigan or Wisconsin soldier will  tell you, for it is white more than half the year with ice and snow, the  sporting ground for polar bears.    While we were fighting the Bolsheviki in Archangel, the National  Geographic Society, in a bulletin, published to our people certain facts  about the country. It is so good that extracts are in this chapter  included:      \"The city of Archangel, Russia, where Allied and American troops have    their headquarters in the fight with the Bolshevik forces, was the    capital of the Archangel Province, or government, under the czar's    regime--a vast, barren and sparsely populated region, cut through by    the Arctic Circle.      \"West and east, the distance across the Archangel district is about    that from London to Rome, from New York to St. Louis, or from Boston    to Charleston, S. C. Its area, exclusive of interior waters, is    greater than that of France, Italy, Belgium and Holland combined. Yet    there are not many more people in these great stretches than are to be    found in Detroit, Mich., or San Francisco or Washington.      \"Arable land in all this territory is less than 1,200 square miles,    and three-fourths of that is given over to pasturage. The richer    grazing land supports Holmagor cattle, a breed said to date back to    the time of Peter the Great, who crossed native herds with cattle    imported from Holland.      \"About fifteen miles from the mouth of the Dvina River, which affords    an outlet to the White Sea, lies the city of Archangel. Norsemen came    to that port in the tenth century for trading. One expedition was    described by Alfred the Great. But first contact with the outside    world was established in the sixteenth century when Sir Richard    Chancellor, an English sailor, stopped at the bleak haven while    attempting a northeast passage to India. Ivan the Terrible summoned    him to Moscow and made his visit the occasion for furthering    commercial relations with England. Thirty years after the Englishman's    visit a town was established and for the next hundred years it was the    Muscovite kingdom's only seaport, chief doorway for trade with England    and Holland.      \"When Peter the Great established St. Petersburg as his new capital    much trade was diverted to the Baltic, but Archangel was compensated    by designation as the capital of the Archangel government.      \"Boris Godunov threw open to all nations, and in the seventeenth    century Tartar prisoners were set to work building a large bazaar and    trading hall. Despite its isolation the city thus became a    cosmopolitan center and up to the time of the world war Norwegian,    German, British, Swedish and Danish cargo vessels came in large    numbers.      \"Every June thousand of pilgrims would pass through Archangel on their    way to the famous far north shrine, Solovetsky Monastery, situated on    an island a little more than half a day's boat journey from Archangel.      \"The city acquired its name from the Convent of Archangel Michael. In    the Troitski Cathedral, with its five domes, is a wooden cross,    fourteen feet high, carved by the versatile Peter the Great, who    learned the use of mallet and chisel while working as a shipwright in    Holland after he ascended the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22542"],[0,"Jesus the Christ (#11)"],[1,"all essential characteristics.    A general consideration of scriptural evidence leads to the conclusion  that God the Eternal Father has manifested Himself to earthly prophets  or revelators on very few occasions, and then principally to attest the  divine authority of His Son, Jesus Christ. As before shown, the Son was  the active executive in the work of creation; throughout the creative  scenes the Father appears mostly in a directing or consulting capacity.  Unto Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham and Moses the Father revealed Himself,  attesting the Godship of the Christ, and the fact that the Son was the  chosen Savior of mankind.[95] On the occasion of the baptism of Jesus,  the Father's voice was heard, saying, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I  am well pleased\";[96] and at the transfiguration a similar testimony was  given by the Father.[97] On an occasion yet later, while Jesus prayed in  anguish of soul, submitting Himself that the Father's purposes be  fulfilled and the Father's name glorified, \"Then came there a voice from  heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it  again.\"[98] The resurrected and glorified Christ was announced by the  Father to the Nephites on the western hemisphere, in these words:  \"Behold my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have  glorified my name: hear ye him.\"[99] From the time of the occurrence  last noted, the voice of the Father was not heard again among men, so  far as the scriptures aver, until the spring of 1820, when both the  Father and the Son ministered unto the prophet Joseph Smith, the Father  saying, \"This is my beloved Son, hear him!\"[100] These are the instances  of record in which the Eternal Father has been manifest in personal  utterance or other revelation to man apart from the Son. God the  Creator, the Jehovah of Israel, the Savior and Redeemer of all nations,  kindreds and tongues, are the same, and He is Jesus the Christ.      NOTES TO CHAPTER 4.    1. Names Given of God.--The significance of names when given of God  finds illustration in many scriptural instances. The following are  examples: \"Jesus\" meaning _Savior_ (Matt. 1:21; Luke 1:31); \"John,\"  signifying _Jehovah's gift_, specifically applied to the Baptist, who  was sent to earth to prepare the way for Jehovah's coming in the flesh  (Luke 1:13); \"Ishmael,\" signifying _God shall hear him_ (Gen. 16:11);  \"Isaac,\" meaning _laughter_ (Gen. 17:19, compare 18:10-15). As instances  of names changed by divine authority to express added blessings, or  special callings, consider the following: \"Abram,\" which connoted  _nobility_ or _exaltation_ and as usually rendered, _father of  elevation_, was changed to \"Abraham,\" _father of a multitude_ which  expressed the reason for the change as given at the time thereof, \"for a  father of many nations have I made thee\" (Gen. 17:5). \"Sarai,\" the name  of Abraham's wife, and of uncertain distinctive meaning, was substituted  by \"Sarah\" which signified _the princess_ (Gen 17:15). \"Jacob,\" a name  given to the son of Isaac with reference to a circumstance attending his  birth, and signifying _a supplanter_, was superseded by \"Israel\" meaning  _a soldier of God, a prince of God_; as expressed in the words effecting  the change, \"Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for as  a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.\"  (Gen. 32:28; compare 35:9, 10.) \"Simon,\" meaning _a hearer_, the name of  the man who became the chief apostle of Jesus Christ, was changed by the  Lord to \"Cephas\" (Aramaic) or \"Peter\" (Greek) meaning _a rock_ (John  1:42; Matt 16:18; Luke 6:14). On James and John the sons of Zebedee, the  Lord conferred the name or title \"Boanerges\" meaning _sons of thunder_  (Mark 3:17).    The following is an instructive excerpt: \"_Name_ in the scriptures not  only = that by which a person is designated, but frequently = all that  is known to belong to the person having this designation, and the person  himself. Thus 'the name of God' or 'of Jehovah,' etc., indicates His  authority (Deut. 18:20; Matt. 21:9, etc.), His dignity and glory (Isa.  48:9, etc.), His protection and favor (Prov. 18:10, etc.), His character  (Exo. 34:5, 14, compare 6, 7, etc.), His divine attributes in general  (Matt. 6:9, etc.), etc. The Lord is said to set or put His name where  the revelation or manifestation of His perfections is made (Deut. 12:5,  14:24, etc.). To believe in or on the name of Christ is to receive and  treat Him in accordance with the revelation which the scriptures make of  Him (John 1:12; 2:23), etc.\"--Smith's _Comprehensive Dictionary of the  Bible_, article \"Name.\"    2. Jesus Christ, the God of Israel.--\"That Jesus Christ was the same  Being who called Abraham from his native country, who led Israel out of  the land of Egypt with mighty miracles and wonders, who made known to  them His law amid the thunderings of Sinai, who delivered them from  their enemies, who chastened them for their disobedience, who inspired  their prophets, and whose glory filled Solomon's temple, is evident from  all the inspired writings, and in none more so than in the Bible.    \"His lamentation over Jerusalem evidences that, in His humanity, He had  not forgotten His former exalted position: 'O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou  that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee,  how often would I have gathered thy children together ... and ye would  not!' (Matt. 23:37). It was this Creator of the world, this mighty  Ruler, this Controller of the destinies of the human family, who, in His  last moments, cried out in the agony of His soul, 'My God, my God, why  hast thou forsaken me?'\" (Mark 15:34.)--From _Compendium of the  Doctrines of the Gospel_, by Franklin D. Richards and James A. Little.    3. \"Jehovah\" a Name Not Uttered by the Jews.--Long prior to the time of  Christ, certain schools among the Jews, ever intent on the observance of  the letter of the law, though not without disregard of its spirit, had  taught that the mere utterance of the name of God was blasphemous, and  that the sin of so doing constituted a capital offense. This extreme  conception arose from the accepted though uninspired interpretation of  Lev. 24:16, \"And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall  surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone  him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he  blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.\" We take the  following from Smith's _Comprehensive Dictionary of the Bible_, article  \"Jehovah\": \"The true pronunciation of this name, [Yehovah] by which God  was known to the Hebrews, has been entirely lost, the Jews themselves  scrupulously avoiding every mention of it, and substituting in its stead  one or other of the words with whose proper vowel-points it may happen  to be written [_Adonai_, Lord, or _Elohim_, God].... According to Jewish  tradition it was pronounced but once a year by the high priest on the  day of atonement when he entered the Holy of Holies; but on this point  there is some doubt.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [67] See \"God and the Godhead,\" in the author's \"Articles of Faith,\"  lecture ii.

The coming of Christ to earth to tabernacle in the flesh was no  unexpected or unheralded event. For centuries prior to the great  occurrence the Jews had professed to be looking for the advent of their  King; and, in the appointed ceremonials of worship as in private  devotions, the coming of the promised Messiah was prominent as a matter  of the supplication of Israel to Jehovah. True, there was much diversity  in lay opinion and in rabbinical exposition as to the time and manner of  His appearing; but the certainty thereof was fundamentally established  in the beliefs and hopes of the Hebrew nation.
