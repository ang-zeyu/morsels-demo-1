She walked about to take a view of all the  palace, and the elegance of every part of it much charmed her.    But what was her surprise, when she came to a door on which was  written, BEAUTY'S ROOM! She opened it in haste, and her eyes were  dazzled by the splendour and taste of the apartment. What made her  wonder more than all the rest, was a large library filled with books,  a harpsichord, and many pieces of music. \"The beast surely does not  mean to eat me up immediately,\" said she, \"since he takes care I shall  not be at a loss how to amuse myself.\" She opened the library and saw  these verses written in letters of gold on the back of one of the  books:--        \"Beauteous lady, dry your tears,      Here's no cause for sighs or fears.      Command as freely as you may,      For you command and I obey.\"    \"Alas!\" said she, sighing; \"I wish I could only command a sight of my  poor father, and to know what he is doing at this moment.\" Just then,  by chance, she cast her eyes on a looking-glass that stood near her,  and in it she saw a picture of her old home, and her father riding  mournfully up to the door. Her sisters came out to meet him, and  although they tried to look sorry, it was easy to see that in their  hearts they were very glad. In a short time all this picture  disappeared, but it caused Beauty to think that the beast, besides  being very powerful, was also very kind. About the middle of the day  she found a table laid ready for her, and a sweet concert of music  played all the time she was dining, without her seeing anybody. But at  supper, when she was going to seat herself at table, she heard the  noise of the beast, and could not help trembling with fear.    \"Beauty,\" said he, \"will you give me leave to see you sup?\"    \"That is as you please,\" answered she, very much afraid.    \"Not in the least,\" said the beast; \"you alone command in this place.  If you should not like my company, you need only say so, and I will  leave you that moment. But tell me, Beauty, do you not think me very  ugly?\"    \"Why, yes,\" said she, \"for I cannot tell a falsehood; but then I think  you are very good.\"    \"Am I?\" sadly replied the beast; \"yet, besides being ugly, I am also  very stupid: I know well enough that I am but a beast.\"    \"Very stupid people,\" said Beauty, \"are never aware of it themselves.\"    At which kindly speech the beast looked pleased, and replied, not  without an awkward sort of politeness, \"Pray do not let me detain you  from supper, and be sure that you are well served. All you see is your  own, and I should be deeply grieved if you wanted for any thing.\"    \"You are very kind--so kind that I almost forgot you are so ugly,\"  said Beauty, earnestly.    \"Ah! yes,\" answered the beast, with a great sigh; \"I hope I am  good-tempered, but still I am only a monster.\"    \"There is many a monster who wears the form of a man; it is better of  the two to have the heart of a man and the form of a monster.\"    \"I would thank you, Beauty, for this speech, but I am too senseless to  say anything that would please you,\" returned the beast in a  melancholy voice; and altogether he seemed so gentle and so unhappy,  that Beauty, who had the tenderest heart in the world, felt her fear  of him gradually vanish.    She ate her supper with a good appetite, and conversed in her own  sensible and charming way, till at last, when the beast rose to  depart, he terrified her more than ever by saying abruptly, in his  gruff voice, \"Beauty, will you marry me!\"    Now Beauty, frightened as she was, would speak only the exact truth;  besides, her father had told her that the beast liked only to have  the truth spoken to him. So she answered, in a very firm tone, \"No,  beast.\"    He did not go into a passion, or do anything but sigh deeply, and  depart.    When Beauty found herself alone, she began to feel pity for the poor  beast. \"Oh!\" said she, \"what a sad thing it is that he should be so  very frightful, since he is so good-tempered!\"    Beauty lived three months in this palace very well pleased. The beast  came to see her every night, and talked with her while she supped; and  though what he said was not very clever, yet, as she saw in him every  day some new goodness, instead of dreading the time of his coming, she  soon began continually looking at her watch, to see if it were nine  o'clock; for that was the hour when he never failed to visit her. One  thing only vexed her, which was that every night before he went away,  he always made it a rule to ask her if she would be his wife, and  seemed very much grieved at her steadfastly replying \"No.\" At last,  one night, she said to him, \"You wound me greatly, beast, by forcing  me to refuse you so often; I wish I could take such a liking to you as  to agree to marry you: but I must tell you plainly, that I do not  think it will ever happen. I shall always be your friend; so try to  let that content you.\"    \"I must,\" sighed the beast, \"for I know well enough how frightful I  am; but I love you better than myself. Yet I think I am very lucky in  your being pleased to stay with me: now promise me, Beauty, that you  will never leave me.\"    Beauty would almost have agreed to this, so sorry was she for him, but  she had that day seen in her magic glass, which she looked at  constantly, that her father was dying of grief for her sake.    \"Alas!\" she said, \"I long so much to see my father, that if you do not  give me leave to visit him, I shall break my heart.\"    \"I would rather break mine, Beauty,\" answered the beast; \"I will send  you to your father's cottage: you shall stay there, and your poor  beast shall die of sorrow.\"    \"No,\" said Beauty, crying, \"I love you too well to be the cause of  your death; I promise to return in a week. You have shown me that my  sisters are married, and my brothers are gone for soldiers, so that my  father is left all alone. Let me stay a week with him.\"    \"You shall find yourself with him to-morrow morning,\" replied the  beast; \"but mind, do not forget your promise. When you wish to return,  you have nothing to do but to put your ring on a table when you go to  bed. Good-bye, Beauty!\" The beast sighed as he said these words, and  Beauty went to bed very sorry to see him so much grieved. When she  awoke in the morning, she found herself in her father's cottage. She  rang a bell that was at her bedside, and a servant entered; but as  soon as she saw Beauty, the woman gave a loud shriek; upon which the  merchant ran upstairs, and when he beheld his daughter he ran to her,  and kissed her a hundred times. At last Beauty began to remember that  she had brought no clothes with her to put on; but the servant told  her she had just found in the next room a large chest full of dresses,  trimmed all over with gold, and adorned with pearls and diamonds.    Beauty, in her own mind, thanked the beast for his kindness, and put  on the plainest gown she could find among them all. She then desired  the servant to lay the rest aside, for she intended to give them to  her sisters; but, as soon as she had spoken these words, the chest was  gone out of sight in a moment. Her father then suggested, perhaps the  beast chose for her to keep them all for herself: and as soon as he  had said this, they saw the chest standing again in the same place.  While Beauty was dressing herself, a servant brought word to her that  her sisters were come with their husbands to pay her a visit. They  both lived unhappily with the gentlemen they had married. The husband  of the eldest was very handsome, but was so proud of this, that he  thought of nothing else from morning till night, and did not care a  pin for the beauty of his wife. The second had married a man of great  learning; but he made no use of it, except to torment and affront all  his friends, and his wife more than any of them. The two sisters were  ready to burst with spite when they saw Beauty dressed like a  princess, and looking so very charming. All the kindness that she  showed them was of no use; for they were vexed more than ever when she  told them how happy she lived at the palace of the beast. The  spiteful creatures went by themselves into the garden, where they  cried to think of her good fortune.    \"Why should the little wretch be better off than we?\" said they. \"We  are much handsomer than she is.\"    \"Sister!\" said the eldest, \"a thought has just come into my head: let  us try to keep her here longer than the week for which the beast gave  her leave; and then he will be so angry, that perhaps when she goes  back to him he will eat her up in a moment.\"    \"That is well thought of,\" answered the other, \"but to do this, we  must pretend to be very kind.\"    They then went to join her in the cottage, where they showed her so  much false love, that Beauty could not help crying for joy.    When the week was ended, the two sisters began to pretend such grief  at the thought of her leaving them, that she agreed to stay a week  more: but all that time Beauty could not help fretting for the sorrow  that she knew her absence would give her poor beast; for she tenderly  loved him, and much wished for his company again. Among all the grand  and clever people she saw, she found nobody who was half so sensible,  so affectionate, so thoughtful, or so kind. The tenth night of her  being at the cottage, she dreamed she was in the garden of the palace,  that the beast lay dying on a grass-plot, and with his last breath put  her in mind of her promise, and laid his death to her forsaking him.  Beauty awoke in a great fright, and burst into tears. \"Am not I  wicked,\" said she, \"to behave so ill to a beast who has shown me so  much kindness? Why will not I marry him? I am sure I should be more  happy with him than my sisters are with their husbands. He shall not  be wretched any longer on my account; for I should do nothing but  blame myself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19737"],[0,"The Principles of Gothic Ecclesiastical Architecture, Elucidated (#11)"],[1,"in the entrance to the  Chapter House, York Cathedral. In some instances the head of the doorway  is foliated, and we observe in detail an approximation to the succeeding  style. The west doorway of Dunchurch Church, Warwickshire, is in this  stage of transition.    Q. How are the windows of this style known?    [Illustration: Square-headed Decorated Window, Ashby Folville,  Leicestershire.]    A. In the later stage of the Early English style the windows became  enlarged, and the heads were filled with foliated circles. To these  succeeded, in the fourteenth century, windows ornamented with geometrical  and flowing tracery, peculiarities which exclusively pertain to this  style, and by which it is most easily known. The windows are of good  proportions, and are divided into two or more principal lights by  mullions, which at the spring of the arch form designs of regular  geometrical construction, or branch out into flowing ramifications  composing flame-like compartments, which are foliated[109-*]. The variety  of tracery in windows of this style is very great, and they frequently  have pedimental and ogee canopies over them, ornamented in the same manner  as those over doors: examples of this kind may be found at York  Cathedral. In the south transept of Chichester, and west front of Exeter  Cathedrals, are two exceeding large and beautiful windows of this style;  the first filled with geometrical, the other with flowing, tracery. In  some windows of this style the mullions simply cross in the head, as in a  later style, but the lights are commonly foliated, and the difference may  in general be discerned by the mouldings: such windows occur in Stoneleigh  Church, Warwickshire. There are also many square-headed windows in this  style, distinguished by the flowing tracery in the heads, and by other  characteristic marks: of such a window in Ashby Folville Church,  Leicestershire, is a rich and good example. Circular windows, filled with  tracery, are not uncommon in large buildings; and we also meet with  triangular spherical-shaped windows, as in the clerestory of Barton  Segrave Church, Northamptonshire[111-*].    [Illustration: Window, Barton Segrave Church.]    Q. Of what description are the mouldings which pertain to this style?    [Illustration: Moulding, Dunchurch Church, Warwickshire.]    [Illustration: Roll Moulding, Chacombe Church, Northamptonshire.]    [Illustration: String-Course, Sedgeberrow Church, Gloucestershire.]    [Illustration: Ball-Flower Ornament, Bloxham Church, Oxfordshire, and York  Cathedral.]    A. They approximate more nearly, in section and appearance, those of the  thirteenth than those of the fifteenth century, but the members are  generally more numerous than in those of the former style; quarter-round,  half, and tripartite cylinder mouldings, often filleted along the face and  divided by small cavetto mouldings, sometimes deeply cut, are common. The  string-course under the windows frequently consists, as in the preceding  style, of a simple roll moulding, the upper member of which overlaps the  lower. A plain semicylindrical moulding, with a square-edged fillet on the  face, is also common, and occurs at the church of Orton-on-the-Hill,  Leicestershire. The hood moulding over the windows often consists of a  quarter-round or ogee, with a cavetto beneath, and sometimes returns  horizontally along the walls as a string-course; a disposition, however,  more frequently observable in the Early English style than in this: of  such disposition the churches of Harvington, Worcestershire, and of  Sedgeberrow, Gloucestershire, may be cited as affording examples. In  decorative work we often meet with the ball-flower, one of the most  characteristic ornaments of the style, consisting of a ball inclosed  within three or four leaves, and sometimes bearing a resemblance to the  rose-bud, inserted at intervals in a cavetto or hollow moulding, with the  accompaniment, in some instances, of foliage; a four-leaved flower,  inserted in the same manner, is also not uncommon.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: Decorated Buttress, St. Mary Magdalen, Oxford.]    Q. How may the buttresses of this style be distinguished?    [Illustration: Flying Buttress, Salisbury Cathedral.]    A. They were worked in stages, and their set-offs have frequently  triangular heads, sometimes plain but often ornamented with crockets and  finials of a more decorative character than those of the Early English  style. Many buttresses have, however, plain slopes as set-offs, and they  are frequently placed diagonally at the corners of buildings, as at  Dunchurch Church, Warwickshire. The flying buttresses at Salisbury  Cathedral, in which the thrust is partly counterpoised by  pyramidal-headed pinnacles decorated with crockets and finials, are of  this age.    Q. What parapet is peculiar to this style?    A. Besides the plain embattled parapet, which is not always easy to be  distinguished from other styles, a horizontal blocking course, pierced  with foliated or wavy, flowing tracery, which has a rich effect, is  common. Of this description specimens occur at St. Mary Magdalen Church,  Oxford, and Brailes Church, Warwickshire.    Q. What is observable in the niches of this style?    A. They are very beautiful, and are generally surmounted by triangular or  ogee-shaped canopies, enriched with crockets and finials, while the  interior of the canopies are groined with numerous small rib mouldings.  The crockets and finials of this style, as decorative embellishments, are  peculiarly graceful, chaste, and pleasing in contour.    Q. Was the transition from this style to the next gradual?    A. Both the transition from the Early English to the Decorated style, and  from the Decorated to the Florid or Perpendicular, was so gradual, that  though many individual details and ornaments were extremely dissimilar,  and peculiar to each particular style, we are only able to judge from  examples when a change was generally established.    Q. From what cotemporary writers of the fourteenth century can we collect  any architectural notices, either general or of detail?    [Illustration: Part of the Altar Screen, Winchester Cathedral.]    A. In Chaucer we find allusions made to _imageries_, _pinnacles_,  _tabernacles_, (canopied niches for statuary,) and _corbelles_. Lydgate,  in _The Siege of Troy_, in his description of the buildings, adverts to  those of his own age, and uses several architectural terms now obsolete or  little understood, and some which are not so, as _gargoiles_. In Pierce  Ploughman's Creed we have a concise but faithful description of a large  monastic edifice of the fourteenth century, comprising the church or  minster, cloister, chapter house, and other offices.    Q. What edifices maybe noticed as constructed in this style?    A. In Exeter Cathedral this style may be said generally to prevail,  although some portions are of earlier and some of later date. Great part  of Lichfield Cathedral was also built during the fourteenth century. The  beautiful cloisters adjoining Norwich Cathedral, commenced A. D. 1297, but  not finished for upwards of a century, although proceeded with by  different prelates from time to time, rank as the most beautiful of the  kind we have remaining. Several country churches are wholly or principally  erected in this style. Broughton Church, Oxfordshire, may be instanced as  an elegant, pleasing, and complete example of plain decorated work.  Trumpington Church, Cambridgeshire, is also deserving of notice; and  Wimington Church, Bedfordshire, built by John Curteys, lord of the manor,  who died A. D. 1391, is a small but late edifice in the Decorated style.  Annexations were also made during this century to numerous churches of  earlier construction, by the erection of additional aisles or chapels as  chantries. In all these structures we find more or less, in general  appearance, form, and detail, of that extreme beauty and elegance of  design which prevailed, as it were, for about a century, and then  imperceptibly glided away.    [Illustration: Parapet, Magdalen Church, Oxford.]      FOOTNOTES:    [106-*] The allusion is made to the vaulted roofs of the nave and choir of  this cathedral as they existed previous to the late unfortunate and  destructive fires.    [109-*] The Flamboyant window, common in France, is not often met with in  this country. On the north side of Salford Church, Warwickshire, is,  however, a window of this description, filled with flamboyant tracery.

[Illustration: South Porch of Newbold-upon-Avon Church, Warwickshire.]    CHAPTER VIII.    OF THE FLORID OR PERPENDICULAR ENGLISH STYLE.      Q. When may this style be said to have commenced, and how long did it  prevail?    A. We find traces of it in buildings erected at the close of the reign of  Edward the Third (circa A. D. 1375); and it prevailed for about a century  and half, or rather more, till late in the reign of Henry the Eighth  (circa A. D. 1539).    Q. Whence does it derive its appellation?    A. From the multiplicity, profusion, and minuteness of its ornamental  detail, it has by some received the designation of FLORID; by others, from  the mullions of the windows and the divisions of ornamental panel-work  running in straight or perpendicular lines up to the head, which is not  the case in any earlier style, it has been called and is now better known  by the designation of the PERPENDICULAR[121-*].    Q. In what respects did it differ from the style which immediately  preceded it?    A. The beautiful flowing contour of the lines of tracery characteristic of  the Decorated style was superseded by mullions and transoms, and, in  panel-work, lines of division disposed vertically and horizontally; and in  lieu of the quarter-round, semi and tripartite roll and small hollow  mouldings"]]]
