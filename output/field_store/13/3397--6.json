The men,  surprised at this, desisted from offering any further injury to it, and  again drew the dead one along as before; when the living badger,  determined not to quit its companion, lay down on it, taking it gently  by one ear, and in that manner was drawn into the midst of the village;  nor could dogs, boys, or men induce it to quit its situation, and to  their shame be it said, they had the inhumanity to kill the poor animal,  and afterwards to burn it, declaring it could not be no other than a  witch.\"    Professor Bell had a badger which followed him like a dog, and which had  been tamed when quite young by some cottager's children, with whom he  played like a puppy. As he grew in years, he became too rough for them,  but at Mr. Bell's was a universal favourite. He yelped with a peculiar,  sharp cry when excluded from his master's presence. He was fed at  dinner-time, and took the morsels in the most orderly manner. He was  very affectionate, good-tempered, and cleanly. He died of a disease  which affects many carnivorous animals in confinement--a contraction of  the lower opening of the stomach, which prevents the food from passing.    In that most interesting book, written by Mr. St. John, and called \"Wild  Sports of the Highlands,\" the author treats at some length of the  badger. I select the following passages from his pages:--    \"I was just then startled from my reverie by a kind of grunt close to  me, and the apparition of a small, waddling, grey animal, who was busily  employed in hunting about the grass and stones at the edge of the loch;  presently another and another appeared in a little grassy glade which  ran down to the water's edge, till at last I saw seven of them busily at  work within a few yards of me, all coming from one direction. It at  first struck me that they were some farmer's pigs taking a distant  ramble; but I shortly saw they were badgers, come from their fastnesses  rather earlier than usual, tempted by the quiet evening, and by a heavy  summer shower that was just over, and which had brought out an infinity  of large black snails and worms, on which the badgers were feeding with  good appetite. As I was dressed in grey, and sitting on a grey rock,  they did not see me, but waddled about, sometimes close to me, only now  and then, as they crossed my track, they showed a slight uneasiness,  smelling the ground, and grunting gently. Presently a very large one,  which I took to be the mother of the rest, stood motionless for a  moment, listening with great attention, and then giving a loud grunt,  which seemed perfectly understood by the others; she scuttled away,  followed by the whole lot. I was soon joined by my attendant, whose  approach they had heard long before my less acute ears gave me warning  of his coming.... When caught in traps, they [badgers] never leave part  of their foot behind them and so escape, as foxes and other vermin  frequently do; but they display very great strength and dexterity in  drawing up the peg of the trap, and this done, they will carry off the  heaviest trap to an amazing distance, over rock or heather. They never  attempt to enter their hole with a trap dangling to their foot, but  generally lay up in some furze bush or thicket.    \"When first caught, their efforts to escape show a degree of strength  and ingenuity which is quite wonderful, digging and tearing at their  prison with the strength of a rhinoceros. I one day found a badger, not  much hurt, in a trap. Tying a rope to his hind leg, I drove him home  before me, as a man drives a pig, but with much less trouble, for he  made no attempts to escape, but trotted quietly ahead, only occasionally  showing a natural inclination to bolt off the main path, whenever he  passed any diverging road, all of which were probably familiar haunts of  the unlucky beast. When at home, I put him into a paved court, where I  thought he could not possibly escape. The next morning, however, he was  gone, having displaced a stone that I thought him quite incapable of  moving, and then digging under a wall.... Sometimes I have known a  badger leave the solitude of the woods and take to some drain in the  cultivated country, where he becomes very bold and destructive to the  crops, cutting down wheat, and ravaging the gardens in a most surprising  manner. One which I know to be now living in this manner, derives great  part of his food during the spring from a rookery, under which he  nightly hunts, feeding on the young rooks that fall from their nests, or  on the old ones that are shot. This badger eludes every attempt to trap  him. Having more than once run narrow risks of this nature, he has  become so cunning, that no one can catch him. If a dozen baited traps  are set, he manages to carry off the baits, and spring every trap,  always with total impunity to himself. At one time he was watched out to  some distance from his drain, and traps were then put in all directions  round it, but, by jumping over some and rolling over others, he escaped  all. In fact, though a despised and maltreated animal, when he has once  acquired a certain experience in worldly matters, few beasts show more  address and cunning in keeping out of scrapes. Though eaten in France,  Germany, and other countries, and pronounced to make excellent hams, we  in Britain despise him as food, though I see no reason why he should not  be quite as good as any pork.    \"The badger becomes immensely fat. Though not a great eater, his quiet  habits and his being a great sleeper prevent his being lean.\" That sleep  is taken in the day, for his habits are generally nocturnal.    All badgers may be recognized by the broad black band across their  cheeks. Those of India have longer legs than those of Europe; their  snout is also prolonged, like that of a hog; and their tail resembles  that of the latter animal. They are very slow in their movement, and  when affronted make a peculiar grunting noise, and bristle up the hair  of their back. If still more roused, they stand on their hind legs as  bears do, have much power in their fore legs, and are extremely savage  when provoked.          WEASELS.      The second tribe of Carnivora walks upon its toes, and is, consequently,  called Digitigrada; it is chiefly composed of a number of smaller  animals, which are very interesting from many of their habits, very  precious from the valuable fur which they afford, and in many instances  are so destructive, that they go under the common name of Vermin. A  numerous genus bears the appellation of Vermiform, because their bodies  are long, and their legs are short, which formation enables them to  slide through small apertures in worm-fashion, twisting themselves  through the winding passages, with their bodies touching the ground.  They destroy much game, and, except when trained to kill rats and  rabbits, are objects of persecution and dislike. Among them are weasels,  polecats, ferrets, martens, skunks, and others. The ermine and sable are  included with the martens; and the three first send forth a disagreeable  odour. They, however, are not to be compared in this respect to the  skunk, which of all creatures is one of the most disagreeable, in  consequence of its foetid gland, which secretes the offensive liquor  sent forth when the animal is frightened or irritated. Nothing will  obliterate this odour, no other scent overcomes it; no burying in the  earth, no washing will avail; even time does not cure, and an article of  dress put by for years, is still unwearable.    It is to weasels and otters that I shall confine myself in this work,  for about their intellectual powers do we know most. The first is a very  courageous beast, not fearing to attack animals much larger than  himself--even man. A labouring peasant at Glencairn, in Dumfrieshire,  was attacked by six of them, who rushed upon him when he was at work in  a field. Being frightened at such a furious onset, he fled, but they  pursued him, although he dealt some back-handed strokes with a large  horsewhip. He was on the point of being seized by the throat, when he  fortunately perceived the fallen branch of a tree. He snatched it up,  and making a stand against his enemies, he killed three, and put the  others to flight. Another instance is reported by Captain Brown, in his  Popular Natural history, where the affray commenced by a person striking  a weasel, which squeaked aloud. This roused a whole colony, consisting  of fifteen, who flew at him and bit him severely. A gentleman came to  his aid, and with his assistance, several of the assailants were killed,  the others ran into the fissures of a neighbouring rock.    There are instances of weasels having been tamed; but it is very  difficult to make any impression on their affections, although they are  very sagacious, and sagacious animals are more easily influenced than  others. The weasel and the stoat are so often mistaken for each other,  that it will be well to point out the constant difference in each. The  stoat is brown above, dirty white underneath; his tail is longer and  more bushy than that of the weasel, and always black at the tip. The  weasel is red above, and pure white underneath, and the tail is red and  uniform, being deprived of the bushy tip. Mr. Bell, from whose pages I  have taken these characters, defends weasels from the accusation of  devouring poultry, game, hares, rabbits, and various small birds. He  says, that when driven by hunger, they may occasionally eat such things;  but that their general food consists of mice and rats of every  description, the field and water vole, and moles; and that they ought  rather to be encouraged than exterminated, because they destroy so much  vermin. They generally approach with the utmost caution and shyness, and  when once they have seized their prey, they never let"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21986"],[0,"The Dash for Khartoum: A Tale of the Nile Expedition (#11)"],[1,"how he had best break the news quietly to his father,  and he got out of the trap that had driven him from the station at the  lodge, and made a long circuit so as to reach the stable without being  seen from the front windows of the house. He went at once to the old  coachman, who was a great ally of the boys. The man uttered an  exclamation of astonishment at seeing him.    \"Why, Master Rupert, I thought that you were not coming home for another  fortnight. Well, you have given me a start!\"    \"Look here, Fellows, I have come to see my father about a serious  matter, and I want to see him before I see my mother.\"    \"Nothing the matter with Master Edgar, I hope, sir?\"    \"Yes, it is about him; but I will tell you presently, Fellows, I don't  want to lose a minute now. Please go into the house and get my father to  come out at once to the stables. Make any excuse you like to bring him  out, and as you come along you can tell him I am here.\"    In five minutes Captain Clinton hurried into the saddle-room, where  Rupert was standing. He was pale and agitated.    \"What is the matter, Rupert,--has anything happened to Edgar? I know  that it must be something very serious or you would never come like  this.\"    \"It is serious, father, very serious;\" and he told him what had  happened, and handed him the letter that Edgar had left. \"You see he has  evidently gone out of his mind, father.\"    Captain Clinton ran his eye over the letter and gave an exclamation of  surprise and grief, then he stood for a minute covering his face with  his hand. When he removed it Rupert saw that his eyes were filled with  tears. \"Poor boy!\" he murmured, \"I see that we have made a terrible  mistake, although we did it for the best.\"    \"A mistake, father! Why, is it possible, can it be true that--\"    \"That Edgar is not your brother, my boy? Yes, it is certain that he is  not your brother, though whether he or you is our son we know not.\"    Rupert stood speechless with astonishment. \"One of us not your son!\" he  said at last in a broken voice. \"Oh, father, how can that be?\"    \"It happened thus, Rupert,\" Captain Clinton said, and then told him the  story of the confusion that had arisen between the children. He then  went on: \"You see, Rupert, we hoped, your mother and I, at first that we  should find out as you grew up, by the likeness one of you might develop  to your mother or myself, which was our child; but for some years now,  my boy, I have feared rather than hoped to discover a likeness, and have  been glad that neither of you took after either of us, as far as we  could see. We loved you equally, and could not bear the thought of  losing either of you. We had two sons instead of one, that was all; and  had one been proved to be ours, we should have lost the other. We  intended to tell you in a short time how the matter stood, and that  while one was our adopted son and the other our own, we neither knew nor  cared which was which, loving you both equally and regarding you both as  our own. Indeed we should never have told you about it, had it not been  that as the story of the confusion at your birth was known to a great  many men who were at that time in India, it was almost sure to come to  your ears sooner or later. Had we ever dreamt that it would come like  this, of course we should have told you long ago. But how can Edgar have  learnt it? Still more, how can anyone have been able to tell him--what  even we do not know--that he is not our son?\"    \"You will know when the letter arrives by the next post, father. But now  I have heard the story, I think it must have been told him by a woman;\"  and he related how they had been watched by a woman who was a stranger  to them.    \"What was she like, Rupert?\"    Rupert described her as well as he was able.    \"I have no doubt that it was Mrs. Humphreys, Rupert; she would be about  the age you describe, and, allowing for the seventeen years that have  passed since I have seen her, like her in appearance. But we had better  go in to your mother now, she must be told. I will go in first and break  it to her. Of course there is nothing else that can be done until we get  Edgar's letter. I will send a man off on horseback to the post-office,  we shall get it an hour earlier than if we wait for the postman to bring  it.\"    It was half an hour before Captain Clinton came out from the  drawing-room and called Rupert in. The boy had been telling the news to  Madge, having asked his father if he should do so. She had been terribly  distressed, and Rupert himself had completely broken down.    \"You can come in now, both of you,\" Captain Clinton said. \"Of course,  your mother is dreadfully upset, so try and keep up for her sake.\"    Mrs. Clinton embraced Rupert in silence, she was too affected for  speech.    \"Do you think,\" she said after a time in broken tones, \"Edgar can have  gone with this woman?\"    \"I don't know, mother; I have not been able to think about it. I should  not think he could. I know if it had been me I should have hated her  even if she was my mother, for coming after all this time to rob me of  your love and father's. I should run away as he has done, I daresay,  though I don't know about that; but I would not have gone with her.\"    \"I cannot make out how she could have known which was which,\" Captain  Clinton said, walking up and down the room; \"we have never seen any  likeness in either of you to ourselves, but it is possible she may have  seen a likeness in Edgar to her husband. By the way,\" he said suddenly,  \"I must send off a telegram to River-Smith; he, of course, will be most  anxious.\" He took a telegram form from his desk, and after a minute's  hesitation wrote: \"No anxiety as to Edgar's mind can account for his  conduct--will write fully to-morrow after I have received his  letter--shall keep Rupert here some days.\" Then putting it in an  envelope, he rang the bell and directed the servant to give it to one of  the grooms with orders to ride with it at once to the nearest telegraph  station.    \"Now, Rupert, the best thing you and Madge can do is to go out for a  walk. You can know nothing more until the letter arrives, and it will be  better for you to be moving about than to be sitting here quietly. Your  mother had best lie down until the letter comes; it cannot be here until  five o'clock.\"    Madge and Rupert as they walked talked the matter over in every possible  light, the only conclusion at which they arrived being that whoever  might be Edgar's father and mother they would always regard him as their  brother, and should love him just the same as before.    \"I cannot think why he ran away!\" Madge exclaimed over and over again.  \"I am sure I should not run away if I found that I wasn't father and  mother's real daughter. They have been everything to me, and I could not  love them a bit less if I did know that I was their adopted child  instead of being their real one.\"    \"No, certainly not,\" Rupert agreed; \"but then, you see, Madge, Edgar may  have thought that he had been adopted, not as childless people sometimes  adopt children, but because they could not help adopting him.\"    \"But that wasn't his fault, Rupert.\"    \"No, that wasn't his fault; but I can understand him feeling that it  made a great difference. Oh, I wonder what he is doing! I expect he went  up to London by the night mail; he would have caught that at Glo'ster.  But what could he do when he got there?\"    \"Oh, I am not thinking about that!\" the girl said. \"I am thinking what  he must feel when he knows father and mother are not his father and  mother, and that you and I are not his brother and sister. It must be  awful, Rupert.\"    \"It must be awful,\" Rupert agreed. \"I do not know what I should have  done had it been me, and you know it might just as well have been me as  Edgar. I wish it were five o'clock!\"    The afternoon seemed indeed endless to them all. For the last half-hour  Rupert and Madge sat at the window gazing across the park for the first  sight of the horseman, and at last they exclaimed simultaneously, \"There  he comes!\"    Captain Clinton, who had been sitting by the sofa holding his wife's  hand in his, rose. \"I will go and meet him,\" he said. \"Rupert and Madge,  you had better go into the library until I call you. I must read it over  first to your mother.\"    Without a word they went into the other room, and from the window  watched Captain Clinton as he walked quickly down the drive to meet the  groom. They saw him take the letter, and, as the man rode on towards the  stables, open it and stand reading it.    \"It is very bad,\" Madge said almost in a whisper, as she saw her father  drop his hand despondently to his side, and then with bent head walk  towards the house. Not another word was spoken until Captain Clinton  opened the door and called them. Madge had been crying silently, and the  tears were running fast down Rupert's cheeks as he sat looking out on to  the park.    \"You had better read the letter here,\" Captain Clinton said. \"I may tell  you what I did not mention before, that there was a strong opinion  among many at the time, that the confusion between the children arose,  not from accident, as was said, but was deliberate, and this letter  confirms that view. This is what has hit Edgar so hard.\"    The letter was as follows:--    \"My dearest father, for I cannot call you anything else, I have just  heard about my birth from a woman who calls herself my mother, and who,  I suppose, has a right to do so, though certainly I shall never call her  or think of her so. She has told me about her child and yours getting  mixed, and how you brought both up in hopes of finding out some day  which was which.    \"Rupert and I had noticed for some days a woman looking at us, and she  met me this afternoon and said she had some thing of extreme importance  to tell me. I went with her and she told me the story, and said that I  was her son and not"]]]
