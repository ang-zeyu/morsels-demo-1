With some, doubtless, it is; with others it probably is not; but I  sincerely believe that the _Word of God_--permeating as it does our  whole community, and influencing these men either directly or  indirectly--is the cause of their self-sacrificing courage, as it is  unquestionably the cause of our national prosperity.        CHAPTER SIX.    SUPPLIES A FEW POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION.    I have now somewhat to say about the Royal National Lifeboat  Institution, which has the entire management and control of our fleet of  273 lifeboats.  That Institution has had a glorious history.  It was  founded by Sir William Hillary, Baronet--a man who deserves a monument  in Westminster Abbey, I think; for, besides originating the Lifeboat  Institution, he saved, and assisted in saving, 305 lives, with his own  hands!    Born in 1824, the Institution has been the means of saving no fewer than  29,608 lives up to the end of 1882.    At its birth the Archbishop of Canterbury presided; the great  Wilberforce, Lord John Russell, and other magnates were present; the  Dukes of Kent, Sussex, and other members of the Royal family, became  vice-patrons, the Earl of Liverpool its president, and George the Fourth  its patron.  In 1850 good Prince Albert became its vice-patron, and her  Majesty the Queen became, and still continues, a warm supporter and  annual contributor.  This is a splendid array of names and titles, but  let me urge the reader never to forget that this noble Institution  depends on the public for the adequate discharge of its grand work, for  it is supported almost entirely by voluntary contributions.    The sole object of the Institution is to provide and maintain boats that  shall save the lives of shipwrecked persons, and to reward those who  save lives, whether by means of its own or other boats.  The grandeur of  its aim and singleness of its purpose are among its great  recommendations.    When, however, life does not require to be saved, and when opportunity  offers, it allows its boats to save property.    It saves--and rewards those who assist in saving--many hundreds of lives  every year.  Last year (1882) the number saved by lifeboats was 741,  besides 143 lives saved by shore-boats and other means, for which  rewards were given by the Institution; making a grand total of 884 lives  saved in that one year.  The number each year is often larger, seldom  less.  One year (1869) the rescued lives amounted to the grand number of  1231, and in the greater number of cases the rescues were effected in  circumstances in which ordinary boats would have been utterly useless--  worse than useless, for they would have drowned their crews.  In respect  of this matter the value of the lifeboat to the nation cannot be  estimated--at least, not until we invent some sort of spiritual  arithmetic whereby we may calculate the price of widows' and orphans'  tears, and of broken hearts!    But in regard to more material things it is possible to speak  definitely.    It frequently happens in stormy weather that vessels show signals of  distress, either because they are so badly strained as to be in a  sinking condition, or so damaged that they are unmanageable, or the  crews have become so exhausted as to be no longer capable of working for  their own preservation.  In all such cases the lifeboat puts off with  the intention in the first instance of saving life.  It reaches the  vessel in distress; some of the boat's crew spring on board, and find,  perhaps, that there is some hope of saving the ship.  Knowing the  locality well, they steer her clear of rocks and shoals.  Being  comparatively fresh and vigorous, they work the pumps with a will,  manage to keep her afloat, and finally steer her into port, thus saving  ship and cargo as well as crew.    Now let me impress on you that incidents of this sort are not of rare  occurrence.  There is no play of fancy in my statements; they happen  every year.  Last year (1882) twenty-three vessels were thus saved by  lifeboat crews.  Another year thirty-three, another year fifty-three,  ships were thus saved.  As surely and regularly as the year comes round,  so surely and regularly are ships and property saved by lifeboats--saved  _to the nation_!  It cannot be too forcibly pointed out that a wrecked  ship is not only an individual, but a national loss.  Insurance protects  the individual, but insurance cannot, in the nature of things, protect  the nation.  If you drop a thousand sovereigns in the street, that is a  loss to you, but not to the nation; some lucky individual will find the  money and circulate it.  But if you drop it into the sea, it is lost not  only to you, but to the nation, indeed to the world itself, for ever,--  of course taking for granted that our amphibious divers don't fish it up  again!    Well, let us gauge the value of our lifeboats in this light.  If a  lifeboat saves a ship worth ten or twenty thousand sovereigns from  destruction, it presents that sum literally as a free gift to owners  _and_ nation.  A free gift, I repeat, because lifeboats are provided  solely to save life--not property.  Saving the latter is, therefore,  extraneous service.  Of course it would be too much to expect our  gallant boatmen to volunteer to work the lifeboats, in the worst of  weather, at the imminent risk of their lives, unless they were also  allowed an occasional chance of earning salvage.  Accordingly, when they  save a ship worth, say 20,000 pounds, they are entitled to put in a  claim on the owners for 200 pounds salvage.  This sum would be divided  (after deducting all expenses, such as payments to helpers, hire of  horses, etcetera) between the men and the boat.  Thus--deduct, say, 20  pounds expenses leaves 180 pounds to divide into fifteen shares; the  crew numbering thirteen men:--    +==================================+==========+  |13 shares to men at 12 pounds each|156 pounds|  +----------------------------------+----------+  |2 shares to boat                  |24 pounds |  +----------------------------------+----------+  |Total                             |180 pounds|  +==================================+==========+    Let us now consider the value of loaded ships.    Not very long ago a large Spanish ship was saved by one of our  lifeboats.  She had grounded on a bank off the south coast of Ireland.  The captain and crew forsook her and escaped to land in their boats.  One man, however, was inadvertently left on board.  Soon after, the wind  shifted; the ship slipped off the bank into deep water, and drifted to  the northward.  Her doom appeared to be fixed, but the crew of the  Cahore lifeboat observed her, launched their boat, and, after a long  pull against wind and sea, boarded the ship and found her with seven  feet of water in the hold.  The duty of the boat's crew was to save the  Spanish sailor, but they did more, they worked the pumps and trimmed the  sails and saved the ship as well, and handed her over to an agent for  the owners.  This vessel and cargo was valued at 20,000 pounds.    Now observe, in passing, that this Cahore lifeboat not only did much  good, but received considerable and well-merited benefit, each man  receiving 34 pounds from the grateful owners, who also presented 68  pounds to the Institution, in consideration of the risk of damage  incurred to their boat.  No doubt it may be objected that this, being a  foreign ship, was not saved to _our_ nation; but, as the proverb says,  \"It is not lost what a friend gets,\" and I think it is very satisfactory  to reflect that we presented the handsome sum of 20,000 pounds to Spain  as a free gift on that occasion.    This was a saved ship.  Let us look now at a lost one.  Some years ago a  ship named the Golden Age was lost.  It was well named though ill-fated,  for the value of that ship and cargo was 200,000 pounds.  The cost of a  lifeboat with equipment and transporting carriage complete is about 650  pounds, and there are 273 lifeboats at present on the shores of the  United Kingdom.  Here is material for a calculation!  If that single  ship had been among the twenty-seven saved last year (and it _might_  have been) the sum thus rescued from the sea would have been sufficient  to pay for all the lifeboats in the kingdom, and leave 22,550 pounds in  hand!  But it was _not_ among the saved.  It was lost--a dead loss to  Great Britain.  So was the Ontario of Liverpool, wrecked in October,  1864, and valued at 100,000 pounds.  Also the Assage, wrecked on the  Irish coast, and valued at 200,000 pounds.  Here are five hundred  thousand pounds--half a million of money--lost by the wreck of these  three ships alone.  Of course, these three are selected as specimens of  the most valuable vessels lost among the two thousand wrecks that take  place _each year_ on our coasts; they vary from a first-rate mail  steamer to a coal coffin, but set them down at any figure you please,  and it will still remain true that it would be worth our while to keep  up our lifeboat fleet, for the mere chance of saving such valuable  property.    But after all is said that can be said on this point, the subject sinks  into insignificance when contrasted with the lifeboat's true work--the  saving of human lives.    There is yet another and still higher sense in which the lifeboat is of  immense value to the nation.  I refer to the moral influence it  exercises among us.  If many hundreds of lives are annually saved by our  lifeboat fleet, does it not follow, as a necessary consequence, that  happiness and gratitude must affect thousands of hearts in a way that  cannot fail to redound to the glory of God, as well as the good of man?  Let facts answer this question.    We cannot of course, intrude on the privacy of human hearts and tell  what goes on there, but there are a few outward symptoms that are  generally accepted as pretty fair tests of spiritual condition.  One of  these is parting with money! "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#11)"],[1," getting me bound  'prentice and rigged out, came and took me aside, and told me that he  was called suddenly away from home, and would not be able to see me  aboard, as he had intended.  `However,' said he, `the captain knows you  are coming, so that's not of much consequence; but as you'll have to  find the ship yourself, you must remember her name and description.  D'ye hear, boy?'  I certainly did hear, but I'm afraid I did not  understand; for my mind was so taken up with the game, which I saw my  side was losing, that I began to grow impatient, and the moment my uncle  finished his description of the ship and bade me good-bye I bolted back  to my game, with only a confused idea of three masts, and a  green-painted taffrail, and a gilt figurehead of Hercules with his club  at the bow.  Next day I was so much cast down with everybody saying  good-bye, and a lot o' my female friends cryin' horribly over me, that I  did not start for the harbour, where the ship was lying among a thousand  others, till it was almost too late.  So I had to run the whole way.  When I reached the pier, there were so many masts, and so much  confusion, that I felt quite humble-bumbled in my faculties.  `Now,'  said I to myself, `Peterkin, you're in a fix.'  Then I fancied I saw a  gilt figurehead and three masts belonging to a ship just about to start;  so I darted on board, but speedily jumped on shore again when I found  that two of the masts belonged to another vessel and the figurehead to a  third!  At last I caught sight of what I made sure was it--a fine large  vessel just casting off her moorings.  The taffrail was green.  Three  masts--yes, that must be it--and the gilt figurehead of Hercules.  To be  sure, it had a three-pronged pitchfork in its hand instead of a club;  but that might be my uncle's mistake, or perhaps Hercules sometimes  varied his weapons.  `Cast off!' roared a voice from the quarter-deck.  `Hold on!' cried I, rushing frantically through the crowd.  `Hold on!  hold on!' repeated some of the bystanders, while the men at the ropes  delayed for a minute.  This threw the captain into a frightful rage; for  some of his friends had come down to see him off, and having his orders  contradicted so flatly was too much for him.  However, the delay was  sufficient.  I took a race and a good leap; the ropes were cast off; the  steam-tug gave a puff, and we started.  Suddenly the captain walks up to  me: `Where did you come from, you scamp, and what do you want here?'    \"`Please, sir,' said I, touching my cap, `I'm your new 'prentice come  aboard.'    \"`New 'prentice!' said he, stamping; `I've got no new 'prentice.  My  boys are all aboard already.  This is a trick, you young blackguard!  You've run away, you have!'  And the captain stamped about the deck and  swore dreadfully; for, you see, the thought of having to stop the ship  and lower a boat and lose half-an-hour, all for the sake of sending a  small boy ashore, seemed to make him very angry.  Besides, it was  blowin' fresh outside the harbour, so that to have let the steamer  alongside to put me into it was no easy job.  Just as we were passing  the pier-head, where several boats were rowing into the harbour, the  captain came up to me.    \"`You've run away, you blackguard!' he said, giving me a box on the ear.    \"`No, I haven't!' said I angrily, for the box was by no means a light  one.    \"`Hark'ee, boy, can you swim?'    \"`Yes,' said I.    \"`Then do it!' and seizing me by my trousers and the nape of my neck, he  tossed me over the side into the sea.  The fellows in the boats at the  end of the pier backed their oars on seeing this; but observing that I  could swim, they allowed me to make the best of my way to the  pier-head.--So you see, Ralph, that I really did swim my first homeward  voyage.\"    Jack laughed, and patted Peterkin on the shoulder.    \"But tell us about the candle-nut tree,\" said I.  \"You were talking  about it.\"    \"Very true,\" said Jack; \"but I fear I can remember little about it.  I  believe the nut is about the size of a walnut; and I think that the  leaves are white, but I am not sure.\"    \"Eh! ha! hum!\" exclaimed Peterkin; \"I saw a tree answering to that  description this very day.\"    \"Did you?\" cried Jack.  \"Is it far from this?\"    \"No, not half-a-mile.\"    \"Then lead me to it,\" said Jack, seizing his axe.    In a few minutes we were all three pushing through the underwood of the  forest, headed by Peterkin.    We soon came to the tree in question, which, after Jack had closely  examined it, we concluded must be the candle-nut tree.  Its leaves were  of a beautiful silvery white, and formed a fine contrast to the  dark-green foliage of the surrounding trees.  We immediately filled our  pockets with the nuts, after which Jack said:    \"Now, Peterkin, climb that cocoa-nut tree and cut me one of the long  branches.\"    This was soon done; but it cost some trouble, for the stem was very  high, and as Peterkin usually pulled nuts from the younger trees, he was  not much accustomed to climbing the high ones.  The leaf or branch was a  very large one, and we were surprised at its size and strength.  Viewed  from a little distance, the cocoa-nut tree seems to be a tall, straight  stem, without a single branch except at the top, where there is a tuft  of feathery-looking leaves that seem to wave like soft plumes in the  wind.  But when we saw one of these leaves or branches at our feet, we  found it to be a strong stalk, about fifteen feet long, with a number of  narrow, pointed leaflets ranged alternately on each side.  But what  seemed to us the most wonderful thing about it was a curious substance  resembling cloth, which was wrapped round the thick end of the stalk  where it had been cut from the tree.  Peterkin told us that he had the  greatest difficulty in separating the branch from the stem on account of  this substance, as it was wrapped quite round the tree, and, he  observed, round all the other branches, thus forming a strong support to  the large leaves while exposed to high winds.  When I call this  substance cloth I do not exaggerate.  Indeed, with regard to all the  things I saw during my eventful career in the South Seas, I have been  exceedingly careful not to exaggerate, or in any way to mislead or  deceive my readers.  This cloth, I say, was remarkably like to coarse  brown cotton cloth.  It had a seam or fibre down the centre of it, from  which diverged other fibres, about the size of a bristle.  There were  two layers of these fibres, very long and tough, the one layer crossing  the other obliquely, and the whole was cemented together with a still  finer fibrous and adhesive substance.  When we regarded it attentively,  we could with difficulty believe that it had not been woven by human  hands.  This remarkable piece of cloth we stripped carefully off, and  found it to be above two feet long by a foot broad, and we carried it  home with us as a great prize.    Jack now took one of the leaflets, and cutting out the central spine or  stalk, hurried back with it to our camp.  Having made a small fire, he  baked the nuts slightly and then peeled off the husks.  After this he  wished to bore a hole in them, which, not having anything better at hand  at the time, he did with the point of our useless pencil-case.  Then he  strung them on the cocoa-nut spine, and on putting a light to the  topmost nut we found, to our joy, that it burned with a clear, beautiful  flame, upon seeing which Peterkin sprang up and danced round the fire  for at least five minutes in the excess of his satisfaction.    \"Now, lads,\" said Jack, extinguishing our candle, \"the sun will set in  an hour, so we have no time to lose.  I shall go and cut a young tree to  make my bow out of, and you had better each of you go and select good  strong sticks for clubs, and we'll set to work at them after dark.\"    So saying, he shouldered his axe and went off; followed by Peterkin;  while I took up the piece of newly discovered cloth, and fell to  examining its structure.  So engrossed was I in this that I was still  sitting in the same attitude and occupation when my companions returned.    \"I told you so!\" cried Peterkin with a loud laugh.--\"Oh Ralph, you're  incorrigible!  See, there's a club for you.  I was sure, when we left  you looking at that bit of stuff, that we would find you poring over it  when we came back, so I just cut a club for you as well as for myself.\"    \"Thank you, Peterkin,\" said I.  \"It was kind of you to do that instead  of scolding me for a lazy fellow, as I confess I deserve.\"    \"Oh, as to that,\" returned Peterkin, \"I'll blow you up yet if you wish  it; only it would be of no use if I did, for you're a perfect mule!\"    As it was now getting dark we lighted our candle, and placing it in a  holder made of two crossing branches inside of our bower, we seated  ourselves on our leafy beds and began to work.    \"I intend to appropriate the bow for my own use,\" said Jack, chipping  the piece of wood he had brought with his axe.  \"I used to be a pretty  fair shot once.--But what's that you're doing?\" he added, looking at  Peterkin, who had drawn the end of a long pole into the tent, and was  endeavouring to fit a small piece of the hoop-iron to the end of it.    \"I'm going to enlist into the Lancers,\" answered Peterkin.  \"You see,  Jack, I find the club rather an unwieldy instrument for my delicately  formed muscles, and I flatter myself I shall do more execution with a  spear.\"    \"Well, if length constitutes power,\" said Jack, \"you'll certainly be  invincible.\"    The pole which Peterkin had cut was full twelve feet long, being a very  strong but light and tough young tree, which merely required thinning at  the butt to be a serviceable weapon.    \"That's a very good idea,\" said I.    \"Which--this?\" inquired Peterkin, pointing to the spear.    \"Yes,\" I replied.    \"Humph!\" said he; \"you'd find it a pretty tough and matter-of-fact idea "]]]
