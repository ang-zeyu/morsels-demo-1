Yet it so happened that within  fourteen years of his conversion Manning was Archbishop of Westminster  and the supreme ruler of the Roman Catholic community in England. This  time the Fates gave up the unequal struggle; they paid over their stakes  in despair, and retired from the game.    Nevertheless it is difficult to feel quite sure that Manning's plunge  was as hazardous as it appeared. Certainly he was not a man who was  likely to forget to look before he leaped, nor one who, if he happened  to know that there was a mattress spread to receive him, would leap with  less conviction. In the light of after-events, one would be glad to know  what precisely passed at that mysterious interview of his with the Pope,  three years before his conversion. It is at least possible that the  authorities in Rome had their eye on Manning; the may well have felt  that the Archdeacon of Chichester would be a great catch. What did Pio  Nono say? It is easy to imagine the persuasive innocence of his Italian  voice. 'Ah, dear Signor Manning, why don't you come over to us? Do you  suppose that we should not look after you?'    At any rate, when he did go over, Manning was looked after very  thoroughly. There was, it is true, a momentary embarrassment at the  outset: it was only with the greatest difficulty that he could bring  himself to abandon his faith in the validity of Anglican Orders, in  which he believed 'with consciousness stronger than all reasoning'. He  was convinced that he was still a priest. When the Rev. Mr. Tierney, who  had received him into the Roman Catholic communion, assured him that  this was not the case, he was filled with dismay and mortification.  After a five hour discussion, he started to his feet in a rage. 'Then,  Mr. Tierney,' he exclaimed, 'you think me insincere.'    The bitter draught was swallowed at last, and, after that, all went  smoothly. Manning hastened to Rome, and was immediately placed by the  Pope in the highly select Accademia Ecclesiastica, commonly known as the  'Nursery of Cardinals', for the purpose of completing his theological  studies. When the course was finished, he continued, by the Pope's  special request, to spend six months of every year in Rome, where he  preached to the English visitors, became acquainted with the great  personages of the Papal court, and enjoyed the privilege of constant  interviews with the Holy Father. At the same time, he was able to make  himself useful in London, where Cardinal Wiseman, the newly created  Archbishop of Westminster, was seeking to reanimate the Roman Catholic  community. Manning was not only extremely popular in the pulpit and in  the confessional; he was not only highly efficient as a gleaner of  souls--and of souls who moved in the best society; he also possessed a  familiarity with official persons and official ways, which was  invaluable. When the question arose of the appointment of Catholic  chaplains in the Crimea during the war, it was Manning who approached  the Minister, interviewed the Permanent Secretary, and finally succeeded  in obtaining all that was required. When a special Reformatory for  Catholic children was proposed, Manning carried through the negotiation  with the Government. When an attempt was made to remove Catholic  children from the Workhouses, Manning was again indispensable. No wonder  Cardinal Wiseman soon determined to find some occupation of special  importance for the energetic convert. He had long wished to establish a  congregation of secular priests in London particularly devoted to his  service, and the opportunity for the experiment had clearly now arisen.  The order of the Oblates of St. Charles was founded in Bayswater, and  Manning was put at its head. Unfortunately, no portion of the body of  St. Charles could be obtained for the new community, but two relics of  his blood were brought over to Bayswater from Milan. Almost at the same  time the Pope signified his appreciation of Manning's efforts by  appointing him Provost of the Chapter of Westminster--a position which  placed him at the head of the Canons of the diocese.    This double promotion was the signal for the outbreak of an  extraordinary internal struggle, which raged without intermission for  the next seven years, and was to end only with the accession of Manning  to the Archbishopric. The condition of the Roman Catholic community in  England was at that time a singular one. On the one hand the old  repressive laws of the seventeenth century had been repealed by liberal  legislation, and on the other a large new body of distinguished converts  had entered the Roman Church as a result of the Oxford Movement. It was  evident that there was a 'boom' in English Catholicism, and, in 1850,  Pius IX recognised the fact by dividing up the whole of England into  dioceses, and placing Wiseman at the head of them as Archbishop of  Westminster. Wiseman's encyclical, dated 'from without the Flaminian  Gate', in which he announced the new departure, was greeted in England  by a storm of indignation, culminating in the famous and furibund letter  of Lord John Russell, then Prime Minister, against the insolence of the  'Papal Aggression'. Though the particular point against which the outcry  was raised--the English territorial titles of the new Roman bishops--was  an insignificant one, the instinct of Lord John and of the English  people was in reality sound enough. Wiseman's installation did mean, in  fact, a new move in the Papal game; it meant an advance, if not an  aggression--a quickening in England of the long-dormant energies of the  Roman Church. That Church has never had the reputation of being an  institution to be trifled with; and, in those days, the Pope was still  ruling as a temporal Prince over the fairest provinces of Italy. Surely,  if the images of Guy Fawkes had not been garnished, on that fifth of  November, with triple crowns, it would have been a very poor compliment  to His Holiness.    But it was not only the honest Protestants of England who had cause to  dread the arrival of the new Cardinal Archbishop; there was a party  among the Catholics themselves who viewed his installation with alarm  and disgust. The families in which the Catholic tradition had been  handed down uninterruptedly since the days of Elizabeth, which had known  the pains of exile and of martyrdom, and which clung together an alien  and isolated group in the midst of English society, now began to feel  that they were, after all, of small moment in the counsels of Rome. They  had laboured through the heat of the day, but now it seemed as if the  harvest was to be gathered in by a crowd of converts who were  proclaiming on every side as something new and wonderful the truths  which the Old Catholics, as they came to be called, had not only known,  but for which they had suffered for generations. Cardinal Wiseman, it is  true, was no convert; he belonged to one of the oldest of the Catholic  families; but he had spent most of his life in Rome, he was out of touch  with English traditions, and his sympathy with Newman and his followers  was only too apparent. One of his first acts as Archbishop was to  appoint the convert W. G. Ward, who was not even in holy orders, to be  Professor of Theology at St. Edmund's College--the chief seminary for  young priests, in which the ancient traditions of Douay were still  flourishing. Ward was an ardent Papalist and his appointment indicated  clearly enough that in Wiseman's opinion there was too little of the  Italian spirit in the English community. The uneasiness of the Old  Catholics was becoming intense, when they were reassured by Wiseman's  appointing as his co-adjutor and successor his intimate friend, Dr.  Errington, who was created on the occasion Archbishop of Trebizond in  partibus infidelium. Not only was Dr. Errington an Old Catholic of the  most rigid type, he was a man of extreme energy, whose influence was  certain to be great; and, in any case, Wiseman was growing old, so that  before very long it seemed inevitable that the policy of the diocese  would be in proper hands. Such was the position of affairs when, two  years after Errington's appointment, Manning became head of the Oblates  of St. Charles and Provost of the Chapter of Westminster.    The Archbishop of Trebizond had been for some time growing more and more  suspicious of Manning's influence, and this sudden elevation appeared to  justify his worst fears. But his alarm was turned to fury when he  learned that St. Edmund's College, from which he had just succeeded in  removing the obnoxious W. G. Ward, was to be placed under the control of  the Oblates of St. Charles. The Oblates did not attempt to conceal the  fact that one of their principal aims was to introduce the customs of a  Roman Seminary into England. A grim perspective of espionage and  tale-bearing, foreign habits, and Italian devotions opened out before  the dismayed eyes of the Old Catholics; they determined to resist to the  utmost; and it was upon the question of the control of St. Edmund's that  the first battle in the long campaign between Errington and Manning was  fought.    Cardinal Wiseman was now obviously declining towards the grave. A man of  vast physique--'your immense', an Irish servant used respectfully to  call him--of sanguine temperament, of genial disposition, of versatile  capacity, he seemed to have engrafted upon the robustness of his English  nature the facile, child-like, and expansive qualities of the South. So  far from being a Bishop Blougram (as the rumour went) he was, in fact,  the very antithesis of that subtle and worldly-wise ecclesiastic. He had  innocently looked forward all his life to the reunion of England to the  See of Peter, and eventually had come to believe that, in God's hand, he  was the instrument destined to bring about this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#11)"],[1,"like that of negligence, which asserts that the party  accused did not [63] come up to the legal standard of action  under the circumstances in which he found himself, and also that  there was no exceptional fact or excuse present which took the  case out of the general rule. It is an averment of a conclusion  of law which is permitted to abridge the facts (positive and  negative) on which it is founded.    When a statute punishes the \"wilfully and maliciously\" injuring  another's property, it is arguable, if not clear, that something  more is meant. The presumption that the second word was not added  without some meaning is seconded by the unreasonableness of  making every wilful trespass criminal. /1/ If this reasoning  prevails, maliciously is here used in its popular sense, and  imports that the motive for the defendant's act was a wish to  harm the owner of the property, or the thing itself, if living,  as an end, and for the sake of the harm. Malice in this sense has  nothing in common with the malice of murder.    Statutory law need not profess to be consistent with itself, or  with the theory adopted by judicial decisions. Hence there is  strictly no need to reconcile such a statute with the principles  which have been explained. But there is no inconsistency.  Although punishment must be confined to compelling external  conformity to a rule of conduct, so far that it can always be  avoided by avoiding or doing certain acts as required, with  whatever intent or for whatever motive, still the prohibited  conduct may not be hurtful unless it is accompanied by a  particular state of feeling.    Common disputes about property are satisfactorily settled by  compensation. But every one knows that sometimes secret harm is  done by neighbor to neighbor out of [64] pure malice and spite.  The damage can be paid for, but the malignity calls for revenge,  and the difficulty of detecting the authors of such wrongs, which  are always done secretly, affords a ground for punishment, even  if revenge is thought insufficient.    How far the law will go in this direction it is hard to say. The  crime of arson is defined to be the malicious and wilful burning  of the house of another man, and is generally discussed in close  connection with malicious mischief. It has been thought that the  burning was not malicious where a prisoner set fire to his  prison, not from a desire to consume the building, but solely to  effect his escape. But it seems to be the better opinion that  this is arson, /1/ in which case an intentional burning is  malicious within the meaning of the rule. When we remember that  arson was the subject of one of the old appeals which take us far  back into the early law, /2/ we may readily understand that only  intentional burnings were redressed in that way. /3/ The appeal  of arson was brother to the appeal de pace et plagis. As the  latter was founded on a warlike assault, the former supposed a  house-firing for robbery or revenge, /4/ such as that by which  Njal perished in the Icelandic Saga. But this crime seems to have  had the same history as others. As soon as intent is admitted to  be sufficient, the law is on the high-road to an external  standard. A man who intentionally sets fire to his own house,  which is so near to other houses that the fire will manifestly  endanger them, is guilty of arson if one of the other houses is  burned in consequence. /5/ In this case, an act which would not  [65] have been arson, taking only its immediate consequences into  account, becomes arson by reason of more remote consequences  which were manifestly likely to follow, whether they were  actually intended or not. If that may be the effect of setting  fire to things which a man has a right to burn, so far as they  alone are concerned, why, on principle, should it not be the  effect of any other act which is equally likely under the  surrounding circumstances to cause the same harm. /1/ Cases may  easily be imagined where firing a gun, or making a chemical  mixture, or piling up oiled rags, or twenty other things, might  be manifestly dangerous in the highest degree and actually lead  to a conflagration. If, in such cases, the crime is held to have  been committed, an external standard is reached, and the analysis  which has been made of murder applies here.    There is another class of cases in which intent plays an  important part, for quite different reasons from those which have  been offered to account for the law of malicious mischief. The  most obvious examples of this class are criminal attempts.  Attempt and intent, of course, are two distinct things. Intent to  commit a crime is not itself criminal. There is no law against a  man's intending to commit a murder the day after tomorrow. The  law only deals with conduct. An attempt is an overt act. It  differs from the attempted crime in this, that the act has failed  to bring about the result which would have given it the character  of the principal crime. If an attempt to murder results in death  within a year and a day, it is murder. If an attempt to steal  results in carrying off the owner's goods, it is larceny.    If an act is done of which the natural and probable [66] effect  under the circumstances is the accomplishment of a substantive  crime, the criminal law, while it may properly enough moderate  the severity of punishment if the act has not that effect in the  particular case, can hardly abstain altogether from punishing it,  on any theory. It has been argued that an actual intent is all  that can give the act a criminal character in such instances. /1/  But if the views which I have advanced as to murder and  manslaughter are sound, the same principles ought logically to  determine the criminality of acts in general. Acts should be  judged by their tendency under the known circumstances, not by  the actual intent which accompanies them.    It may be true that in the region of attempts, as elsewhere, the  law began with cases of actual intent, as those cases are the  most obvious ones. But it cannot stop with them, unless it  attaches more importance to the etymological meaning of the word  attempt than to the general principles of punishment. Accordingly  there is at least color of authority for the proposition that an  act is punishable as an attempt, if, supposing it to have  produced its natural and probable effect, it would have amounted  to a substantive crime. /2/    But such acts are not the only punishable attempts. There is  another class in which actual intent is clearly necessary, and  the existence of this class as well as the name (attempt) no  doubt tends to affect the whole doctrine. Some acts may be  attempts or misdemeanors which [67] could not have effected the  crime unless followed by other acts on the part of the  wrong-doer. For instance, lighting a match with intent to set  fire to a haystack has been held to amount to a criminal attempt  to burn it, although the defendant blew out the match on seeing  that he was watched. /1/ So the purchase of dies for making  counterfeit coin is a misdemeanor, although of course the coin  would not be counterfeited unless the dies were used. /2/    In such cases the law goes on a new principle, different from  that governing most substantive crimes. The reason for punishing  any act must generally be to prevent some harm which is foreseen  as likely to follow that act under the circumstances in which it  is done. In most substantive crimes the ground on which that  likelihood stands is the common working of natural causes as  shown by experience. But when an act is punished the natural  effect of which is not harmful under the circumstances, that  ground alone will not suffice. The probability does not exist  unless there are grounds for expecting that the act done will be  followed by other acts in connection with which its effect will  be harmful, although not so otherwise. But as in fact no such  acts have followed, it cannot, in general, be assumed, from the  mere doing of what has been done, that they would have followed  if the actor had not been interrupted. They would not have  followed it unless the actor had chosen, and the only way  generally available to show that he would have chosen to do them  is by showing that he intended to do them when he did what he  did. The accompanying intent in that case renders the otherwise  [68] innocent act harmful, because it raises a probability that  it will be followed by such other acts and events as will all  together result in harm. The importance of the intent is not to  show that the act was wicked, but to show that it was likely to  be followed by hurtful consequences.    It will be readily seen that there are limits to this kind of  liability. The law does not punish every act which is done with  the intent to bring about a crime. If a man starts from Boston to  Cambridge for the purpose of committing a murder when he gets  there, but is stopped by the draw and goes home, he is no more  punishable than if he had sat in his chair and resolved to shoot  somebody, but on second thoughts had given up the notion. On the  other hand, a slave who ran after a white woman, but desisted  before he caught her, has been convicted of an attempt to commit  rape. /1/ We have seen what amounts to an attempt to burn a  haystack; but it was said in the same case, that, if the  defendant had gone no further than to buy a box of matches for  the purpose, he would not have been liable.    Eminent judges have been puzzled where to draw the line, or even  to state the principle on which it should be drawn, between the  two sets of cases. But the principle is believed to be similar to  that on which all other lines are drawn by the law. Public  policy, that is to say, legislative considerations, are at the  bottom of the matter; the considerations being, in this case, the  nearness of the danger, the greatness of the harm, and the"]]]
