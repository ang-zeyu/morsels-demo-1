And whatever member of the human body is deficient, produceth a  deficiency in the other members. The brain is connected with the heart and  stomach, the lungs are connected with all the members. So is it with the  other members of the body.    And each one of these members hath its own special function. The mind  force--whether we call it pre-existent or contingent--doth direct and  co-ordinate all the members of the human body, seeing to it that each part  or member duly performeth its own special function. If, however, there be  some interruption in the power of the mind, all the members will fail to  carry out their essential functions, deficiencies will appear in the body  and the functioning of its members, and the power will prove ineffective.    Likewise, look into this endless universe: a universal power inevitably  existeth, which encompasseth all, directing and regulating all the parts  of this infinite creation; and were it not for this Director, this  Co-ordinator, the universe would be flawed and deficient. It would be even  as a madman; whereas ye can see that this endless creation carrieth out  its functions in perfect order, every separate part of it performing its  own task with complete reliability, nor is there any flaw to be found in  all its workings. Thus it is clear that a Universal Power existeth,  directing and regulating this infinite universe. Every rational mind can  grasp this fact.    Furthermore, although all created things grow and develop, yet are they  subjected to influences from without. For instance, the sun giveth heat,  the rain nourisheth, the wind bringeth life, so that man can develop and  grow. Thus it is clear that the human body is under influences from the  outside, and that without those influences man could not grow. And  likewise, those outside influences are subjected to other influences in  their turn. For example, the growth and development of a human being is  dependent upon the existence of water, and water is dependent upon the  existence of rain, and rain is dependent upon the existence of clouds, and  clouds are dependent upon the existence of the sun, which causeth land and  sea to produce vapour, the condensation of vapour forming the clouds. Thus  each one of these entities exerteth its influence and is likewise  influenced in its turn. Inescapably then, the process leadeth to One Who  influenceth all, and yet is influenced by none, thus severing the chain.  The inner reality of that Being, however, is not known, although His  effects are clear and evident.    And further, all created beings are limited, and this very limitation of  all beings proveth the reality of the Limitless; for the existence of a  limited being denoteth the existence of a Limitless One.    To sum it up, there are many such proofs, establishing the existence of  that Universal Reality. And since that Reality is pre-existent, It is  untouched by the conditions that govern phenomena; for whatever entity is  subject to circumstances and the play of events is contingent, not  pre-existent. Know then: that divinity which other communions and peoples  have conjured up, falleth within the scope of their imagination, and not  beyond it, whereas the reality of the Godhead is beyond all conceiving.    As to the Holy Manifestations of God, They are the focal points where the  signs, tokens and perfections of that sacred, pre-existent Reality appear  in all their splendour. They are an eternal grace, a heavenly glory, and  on Them dependeth the everlasting life of humankind. To illustrate: the  Sun of Truth dwelleth in a sky to which no soul hath any access, and which  no mind can reach, and He is far beyond the comprehension of all  creatures. Yet the Holy Manifestations of God are even as a looking-glass,  burnished and without stain, which gathereth streams of light out of that  Sun, and then scattereth the glory over the rest of creation. In that  polished surface, the Sun with all Its majesty standeth clearly revealed.  Thus, should the mirrored Sun proclaim, 'I am the Sun!' this is but truth;  and should It cry, 'I am not the Sun!' this is the truth as well. And  although the Day-Star, with all Its glory, Its beauty, Its perfections, be  clearly visible in that mirror without stain, still It hath not come down  from Its own lofty station in the realms above, It hath not made Its way  into the mirror; rather doth It continue to abide, as It will forever, in  the supernal heights of Its own holiness.    And further, all the earth's creatures require the bounty of the sun, for  their very existence is dependent upon solar light and heat. Should they  be deprived of the sun, they would be wiped out. This is the being with  God, as referred to in the Holy Books: man must be with his Lord.    It is clear, then, that the essential reality of God is revealed in His  perfections; and the sun, with its perfections, reflected in a mirror, is  a visible thing, an entity clearly expressing the bounty of God.    My hope is that thou wilt acquire a perceptive eye, a hearing ear, and  that the veils will be removed from thy sight.            22: O THOU WHO ART TURNING THY FACE TOWARDS GOD! ...      O thou who art turning thy face towards God! Close thine eyes to all  things else, and open them to the realm of the All-Glorious. Ask  whatsoever thou wishest of Him alone; seek whatsoever thou seekest from  Him alone. With a look He granteth a hundred thousand hopes, with a glance  He healeth a hundred thousand incurable ills, with a nod He layeth balm on  every wound, with a glimpse He freeth the hearts from the shackles of  grief. He doeth as He doeth, and what recourse have we? He carrieth out  His Will, He ordaineth what He pleaseth. Then better for thee to bow down  thy head in submission, and put thy trust in the All-Merciful Lord.            23: O THOU WHO DOST SEARCH AFTER TRUTH! THY LETTER OF ...      O thou who dost search after truth! Thy letter of 13 December 1920 hath  come.    From the days of Adam until today, the religions of God have been made  manifest, one following the other, and each one of them fulfilled its due  function, revived mankind, and provided education and enlightenment. They  freed the people from the darkness of the world of nature and ushered them  into the brightness of the Kingdom. As each succeeding Faith and Law  became revealed it remained for some centuries a richly fruitful tree and  to it was committed the happiness of humankind. However, as the centuries  rolled by, it aged, it flourished no more and put forth no fruit,  wherefore was it then made young again.    The religion of God is one religion, but it must ever be renewed. Moses,  for example, was sent forth to man and He established a Law, and the  Children of Israel, through that Mosaic Law, were delivered out of their  ignorance and came into the light; they were lifted up from their  abjectness and attained to a glory that fadeth not. Still, as the long  years wore on, that radiance passed by, that splendour set, that bright  day turned to night; and once that night grew triply dark, the star of the  Messiah dawned, so that again a glory lit the world.    Our meaning is this: the religion of God is one, and it is the educator of  humankind, but still, it needs must be made new. When thou dost plant a  tree, its height increaseth day by day. It putteth forth blossoms and  leaves and luscious fruits. But after a long time, it doth grow old,  yielding no fruitage any more. Then doth the Husbandman of Truth take up  the seed from that same tree, and plant it in a pure soil; and lo, there  standeth the first tree, even as it was before.    Note thou carefully that in this world of being, all things must ever be  made new. Look at the material world about thee, see how it hath now been  renewed. The thoughts have changed, the ways of life have been revised,  the sciences and arts show a new vigour, discoveries and inventions are  new, perceptions are new. How then could such a vital power as  religion--the guarantor of mankind's great advances, the very means of  attaining everlasting life, the fosterer of infinite excellence, the light  of both worlds--not be made new? This would be incompatible with the grace  and loving-kindness of the Lord.    Religion, moreover, is not a series of beliefs, a set of customs; religion  is the teachings of the Lord God, teachings which constitute the very life  of humankind, which urge high thoughts upon the mind, refine the  character, and lay the groundwork for man's everlasting honour.    Note thou: could these fevers in the world of the mind, these fires of war  and hate, of resentment and malice among the nations, this aggression of  peoples against peoples, which have destroyed the tranquillity of the  whole world ever be made to abate, except through the living waters of the  teachings of God? No, never!    And this is clear: a power above and beyond the powers of nature must  needs be brought to bear, to change this black darkness into light, and  these hatreds and resentments, grudges and spites, these endless wrangles  and wars, into fellowship and love amongst all the peoples of the earth.  This power is none other than the breathings of the Holy Spirit and the  mighty inflow of the Word of God.            24: O SPIRITUAL YOUTH! PRAISE THOU GOD THAT THOU HAST ...      O spiritual youth! Praise thou God that thou hast found thy way into the  Kingdom of Splendours, and hast rent asunder the veil of vain imaginings,  and that the core of the inner mystery hath been made known unto thee.    This people, all of them, have pictured a god in the realm of the mind,  and worship that image which they have made for themselves. And yet that  image is comprehended, the human mind being the comprehender thereof, and  certainly the comprehender is greater than that which lieth within its  grasp; for imagination is but the branch, while mind is the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19289"],[0,"Some Answered Questions (#11)"],[1,"xistence, and that  in reality they are under the rule of death.    \"That Thou shouldst give reward unto Thy servants the prophets, and the  saints, and them that fear Thy name, small and great\"(66)--that is to say,  He will distinguish the righteous by endless bounty, making them shine on  the horizon of eternal honor, like the stars of heaven. He will assist  them by endowing them with behavior and actions which are the light of the  world of humanity, the cause of guidance, and the means of everlasting  life in the Divine Kingdom.    \"And shouldst destroy them which destroy the earth\"(67) means that He will  entirely deprive the neglectful; for the blindness of the blind will be  manifest, and the vision of the seers will be evident; the ignorance and  want of knowledge of the people of error will be recognized, and the  knowledge and wisdom of the people under guidance will be apparent;  consequently, the destroyers will be destroyed.    \"And the temple of God was opened in heaven\"(68) means that the divine  Jerusalem is found, and the Holy of Holies has become visible. The Holy of  Holies, according to the terminology of the people of wisdom, is the  essence of the Divine Law, and the heavenly and true teachings of the  Lord, which have not been changed in the cycle of any Prophet, as it was  before explained. The sanctuary of Jerusalem is likened to the reality of  the Law of God, which is the Holy of Holies; and all the laws,  conventions, rites and material regulations are the city of Jerusalem--this  is why it is called the heavenly Jerusalem. Briefly, as in this cycle the  Sun of Reality will make the light of God shine with the utmost splendor,  therefore, the essence of the teachings of God will be realized in the  world of existence, and the darkness of ignorance and want of knowledge  will be dispelled. The world will become a new world, and enlightenment  will prevail. So the Holy of Holies will appear.    \"And the temple of God was opened in heaven\"(69) means also that by the  diffusion of the divine teachings, the appearance of these heavenly  mysteries, and the rising of the Sun of Reality, the doors of success and  prosperity will be opened in all directions, and the signs of goodness and  heavenly benedictions will be made plain.    \"And there was seen in His temple the ark of His Testament\"(70)--that is to  say, the Book of His Testament will appear in His Jerusalem, the Epistle  of the Covenant(71) will be established, and the meaning of the Testament  and of the Covenant will become evident. The renown of God will overspread  the East and West, and the proclamation of the Cause of God will fill the  world. The violators of the Covenant will be degraded and dispersed, and  the faithful cherished and glorified, for they cling to the Book of the  Testament and are firm and steadfast in the Covenant.    \"And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an  earthquake, and great hail,\"(72) meaning that after the appearance of the  Book of the Testament there will be a great storm, and the lightnings of  the anger and the wrath of God will flash, the noise of the thunder of the  violation of the Covenant will resound, the earthquake of doubts will take  place, the hail of torments will beat upon the violators of the Covenant,  and even those who profess belief will fall into trials and temptations.          12: COMMENTARY ON THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF ISAIAH      In Isaiah, chapter 11, verses 1 to 10, it is said: \"And there shall come  forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his  roots: And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of  wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of  knowledge and of the fear of the Lord; And shall make him of quick  understanding in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not judge after the  sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: But with  righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the  meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth,  and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. And  righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the  girdle of his reins. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the  leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and  the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and  the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the  lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the  hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the  cockatrice' den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain:  for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters  cover the sea.\"    This rod out of the stem of Jesse might be correctly applied to Christ,  for Joseph was of the descendants of Jesse, the father of David; but as  Christ found existence through the Spirit of God, He called Himself the  Son of God. If He had not done so, this description would refer to Him.  Besides this, the events which he indicated as coming to pass in the days  of that rod, if interpreted symbolically, were in part fulfilled in the  day of Christ, but not all; and if not interpreted, then decidedly none of  these signs happened. For example, the leopard and the lamb, the lion and  the calf, the child and the asp, are metaphors and symbols for various  nations, peoples, antagonistic sects and hostile races, who are as  opposite and inimical as the wolf and lamb. We say that by the breath of  the spirit of Christ they found concord and harmony, they were vivified,  and they associated together.    But \"they shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain: for the  earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the  sea.\" These conditions did not prevail in the time of the manifestation of  Christ; for until today various and antagonistic nations exist in the  world: very few acknowledge the God of Israel, and the greater number are  without the knowledge of God. In the same way, universal peace did not  come into existence in the time of Christ--that is to say, between the  antagonistic and hostile nations there was neither peace nor concord,  disputes and disagreements did not cease, and reconciliation and sincerity  did not appear. So, even at this day, among the Christian sects and  nations themselves, enmity, hatred and the most violent hostility are met  with.    But these verses apply word for word to Baha'u'llah. Likewise in this  marvelous cycle the earth will be transformed, and the world of humanity  arrayed in tranquillity and beauty. Disputes, quarrels and murders will be  replaced by peace, truth and concord; among the nations, peoples, races  and countries, love and amity will appear. Cooperation and union will be  established, and finally war will be entirely suppressed. When the laws of  the Most Holy Book are enforced, contentions and disputes will find a  final sentence of absolute justice before a general tribunal of the  nations and kingdoms, and the difficulties that appear will be solved. The  five continents of the world will form but one, the numerous nations will  become one, the surface of the earth will become one land, and mankind  will be a single community. The relations between the countries--the  mingling, union and friendship of the peoples and communities--will reach  to such a degree that the human race will be like one family and kindred.  The light of heavenly love will shine, and the darkness of enmity and  hatred will be dispelled from the world. Universal peace will raise its  tent in the center of the earth, and the blessed Tree of Life will grow  and spread to such an extent that it will overshadow the East and the  West. Strong and weak, rich and poor, antagonistic sects and hostile  nations--which are like the wolf and the lamb, the leopard and kid, the  lion and the calf--will act toward each other with the most complete love,  friendship, justice and equity. The world will be filled with science,  with the knowledge of the reality of the mysteries of beings, and with the  knowledge of God.    Now consider, in this great century which is the cycle of Baha'u'llah,  what progress science and knowledge have made, how many secrets of  existence have been discovered, how many great inventions have been  brought to light and are day by day multiplying in number. Before long,  material science and learning, as well as the knowledge of God, will make  such progress and will show forth such wonders that the beholders will be  amazed. Then the mystery of this verse in Isaiah, \"For the earth shall be  full of the knowledge of the Lord,\" will be completely evident.    Reflect also that in the short time since Baha'u'llah has appeared, people  from all countries, nations and races have entered under the shadow of  this Cause. Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, Buddhists, Hindus and Persians  all associate together with the greatest friendship and love, as if indeed  these people had been related and connected together, they and theirs, for  a thousand years; for they are like father and child, mother and daughter,  sister and brother. This is one of the meanings of the companionship of  the wolf and the lamb, the leopard and the kid, and the lion and the calf.    One of the great events which is to occur in the Day of the manifestation  of that Incomparable Branch (Baha'u'llah) is the hoisting of the Standard  of God among all nations. By this is meant that all nations and kindreds  will be gathered together under the shadow of this Divine Banner, which is  no other than the Lordly Branch itself, and will become a single nation.  Religious and sectarian antagonism, the hostility of races and peoples,  and differences among nations, will be eliminated. All men will adhere to  one religion, will have one"]]]
