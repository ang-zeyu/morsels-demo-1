And I am bold enough to suspect that if men could analyse their own  ideas, they would generally find themselves to be in a similar  predicament as to both these profound topics. Hence I incline to lay it  down as a probable proposition that men as a rule have no intuitive  knowledge of their own immortality, and that if there is any natural  knowledge of such a thing it can only be acquired by a process of  reasoning from experience.[4]    [Sidenote: The idea of immortality seems to have been suggested to man  both by his inward and his outward experience, notably by dreams, which  are a case of inward experience.]    What then is the kind of experience from which the theory of human  immortality is deduced? Is it our experience of the operations of our  own minds? or is it our experience of external nature? As a matter of  historical fact--and you will remember that I am treating the question  purely from the historical standpoint--men seem to have inferred the  persistence of their personality after death both from the one kind of  experience and from the other, that is, both from the phenomena of their  inner life and from the phenomena of what we call the external world.  Thus the savage, with whose beliefs we are chiefly concerned in these  lectures, finds a very strong argument for immortality in the phenomena  of dreams, which are strictly a part of his inner life, though in his  ignorance he commonly fails to discriminate them from what we popularly  call waking realities. Hence when the images of persons whom he knows to  be dead appear to him in a dream, he naturally infers that these persons  still exist somewhere and somehow apart from their bodies, of the decay  or destruction of which he may have had ocular demonstration. How could  he see dead people, he asks, if they did not exist? To argue that they  have perished like their bodies is to contradict the plain evidence of  his senses; for to the savage still more than to the civilised man  seeing is believing; that he sees the dead only in dreams does not shake  his belief, since he thinks the appearances of dreams just as real as  the appearances of his waking hours. And once he has in this way gained  a conviction that the dead survive and can help or harm him, as they  seem to do in dreams, it is natural or necessary for him to extend the  theory to the occurrences of daily life, which, as I have said, he does  not sharply distinguish from the visions of slumber. He now explains  many of these occurrences and many of the processes of nature by the  direct interposition of the spirits of the departed; he traces their  invisible hand in many of the misfortunes and in some of the blessings  which befall him; for it is a common feature of the faith in ghosts, at  least among savages, that they are usually spiteful and mischievous, or  at least testy and petulant, more apt to injure than to benefit the  survivors. In that they resemble the personified spirits of nature,  which in the opinion of most savages appear to be generally tricky and  malignant beings, whose anger is dangerous and whose favour is courted  with fear and trembling. Thus even without the additional assurance  afforded by tales of apparitions and spectres, primitive man may come in  time to imagine the world around him to be more or less thickly peopled,  influenced, and even dominated by a countless multitude of spirits,  among whom the shades of past generations of men and women hold a very  prominent, often apparently the leading place. These spirits, powerful  to help or harm, he seeks either simply to avert, when he deems them  purely mischievous, or to appease and conciliate, when he supposes them  sufficiently good-natured to respond to his advances. In some such way  as this, arguing from the real but, as we think, misinterpreted  phenomena of dreams, the savage may arrive at a doctrine of human  immortality and from that at a worship of the dead.    [Sidenote: It has also been suggested by the resemblance of the living  to the dead, which is a case of outward experience.]    This explanation of the savage faith in immortality is neither novel nor  original: on the contrary it is perhaps the commonest and most familiar  that has yet been propounded. If it does not account for all the facts,  it probably accounts for many of them. At the same time I do not doubt  that many other inferences drawn from experiences of different kinds  have confirmed, even if they did not originally suggest, man's confident  belief in his own immortality. To take a single example of outward  experience, the resemblances which children often bear to deceased  kinsfolk appear to have prompted in the minds of many savages the notion  that the souls of these dead kinsfolk have been born again in their  descendants.[5] From a few cases of resemblances so explained it would  be easy to arrive at a general theory that all living persons are  animated by the souls of the dead; in other words, that the human spirit  survives death for an indefinite period, if not for eternity, during  which it undergoes a series of rebirths or reincarnations. However it  has been arrived at, this doctrine of the transmigration or  reincarnation of the soul is found among many tribes of savages; and  from what we know on the subject we seem to be justified in conjecturing  that at certain stages of mental and social evolution the belief in  metempsychosis has been far commoner and has exercised a far deeper  influence on the life and institutions of primitive man than the actual  evidence before us at present allows us positively to affirm.    [Sidenote: The aim of these lectures is to collect a number of facts  illustrative of the belief in immortality and of the customs based on it  among some of the lower races.]    Be that as it may--and I have no wish to dogmatise on so obscure a  topic--it is certain that a belief in the survival of the human  personality after death and the practice of a propitiation or worship of  the dead have prevailed very widely among mankind and have played a very  important part in the development of natural religion. While many  writers have duly recognised the high importance both of the belief and  of the worship, no one, so far as I know, has attempted systematically  to collect and arrange the facts which illustrate the prevalence of this  particular type of religion among the various races of mankind. A large  body of evidence lies to hand in the voluminous and rapidly increasing  literature of ethnology; but it is dispersed over an enormous number of  printed books and papers, to say nothing of the materials which still  remain buried either in manuscript or in the minds of men who possess  the requisite knowledge but have not yet committed it to writing. To  draw all those stores of information together and digest them into a  single treatise would be a herculean labour, from which even the most  industrious researcher into the dusty annals of the human past might  shrink dismayed. Certainly I shall make no attempt to perform such a  feat within the narrow compass of these lectures. But it seems to me  that I may make a useful, if a humble, contribution to the history of  religion by selecting a portion of the evidence and submitting it to my  hearers. For that purpose, instead of accumulating a mass of facts from  all the various races of mankind and then comparing them together, I  prefer to limit myself to a few races and to deal with each of them  separately, beginning with the lowest savages, about whom we possess  accurate information, and gradually ascending to peoples who stand  higher in the scale of culture. In short the method of treatment which I  shall adopt will be the descriptive rather than the comparative. I shall  not absolutely refrain from instituting comparisons between the customs  and beliefs of different races, but for the most part I shall content  myself with describing the customs and beliefs of each race separately  without reference to those of others. Each of the two methods, the  comparative and the descriptive, has its peculiar advantages and  disadvantages, and in my published writings I have followed now the one  method and now the other. The comparative method is unquestionably the  more attractive and stimulating, but it cannot be adopted without a good  deal of more or less conscious theorising, since every comparison  implicitly involves a theory. If we desire to exclude theories and  merely accumulate facts for the use of science, the descriptive method  is undoubtedly the better adapted for the arrangement of our materials:  it may not stimulate enquiry so powerfully, but it lays a more solid  foundation on which future enquirers may build. It is as a collection of  facts illustrative of the belief in immortality and of all the momentous  consequences which have flowed from that belief, that I desire the  following lectures to be regarded. They are intended to serve simply as  a document of religious history; they make no pretence to discuss  philosophically the truth of the beliefs and the morality of the  practices which will be passed under review. If any inferences can  indeed be drawn from the facts to the truth or falsehood of the beliefs  and to the moral worth or worthlessness of the practices, I prefer to  leave it to others more competent than myself to draw them. My sight is  not keen enough, my hand is not steady enough to load the scales and  hold the balance in so difficult "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20153"],[0,"The American Journal of Archaeology, 1893-1 (#11)"],[1," the           distance between the nail-holes in terracottas and cornice           blocks corresponding exactly. The fact that the stone, where           covered, was only roughly worked made the connection still more           sure. These plates were used on the cornice of the long side,           and bounded the pediment space above and below. The           corresponding cyma was of the same material and similarly           decorated.             It seems surprising that such a terracotta sheathing should be           applied on a structure of stone. For a wooden building, on the           other hand, it would be altogether natural. It was possible to           protect wooden columns, architraves and triglyphs from the           weather by means of a wide cornice. But the cornice itself           could not but be exposed, and so this means of protection was           devised. Of course no visible proof of all this is at hand in           the shape of wooden temples yet remaining. But Dr. Dörpfeld's           demonstration[46] removes all possible doubt. Pausanias[47]           tells us that in the Heraion at Olympia there was still           preserved in his day an old wooden column. Now from the same           temple no trace of architrave, triglyph or cornice has been           found; a fact that is true of no other building in Olympia and           seems to make it certain that here wood never was replaced by           stone. When temples came to be built of stone, it seems that           this plan of terracotta covering was retained for a time,           partly from habit, partly because of its fine decorative           effect. But it was soon found that marble was capable of           withstanding the wear of weather and that the ornament could be           applied to it directly by painting.

Berlin, 1884, p. 137 _seq_.]             [Footnote 47: V, 20. 6.]    Page 31  In order to carry the investigation a step further Messrs.           Dörpfeld, Gräber, Borrmann and Siebold undertook a journey to           Gela and the neighboring cities of Sicily and Magna           Graecia.[48] The results of this journey were most           satisfactory. Not only in Gela, but in Syracuse, Selinous,           Akrai, Kroton, Metapontum and Paestum, precisely similar           terracottas were found to have been employed in the same way.           Furthermore just such cyma pieces have been discovered           belonging to other structures in Olympia and amid the           pre-Persian ruins on the Acropolis of Athens. It is not yet           proven that this method of decoration was universal or even           widespread in Greece; but of course the fragile nature of           terracotta and the fact that it was employed only in the oldest           structures, would make discoveries rare.             Another important argument is furnished by the certain use of           terracotta plates as acroteria. Pausanias[49] mentions such           acroteria on the Stoa Basileios on the agora of Athens.           Pliny[50] says that such works existed down to his day, and           speaks of their great antiquity. Fortunately a notable example           has been preserved in the acroterium of the gable of the           Heraion at Olympia,[51] a great disk of clay over seven feet in           diameter. It forms a part, says Dr. Dörpfeld, of the oldest           artistic roof construction that has remained to us from Greek           antiquity. That is, the original material of the acroteria was           the same used in the whole covering of the roof, namely           terracotta. The gargoyles also, which later were always of           stone, were originally of terracotta. Further we find reliefs           in terracotta pierced with nail-holes and evidently intended           for the covering of various wooden objects; sometimes, it is           safe to say, for wooden sarcophagi. Here appears clearly the           connection that these works may have had with the later reliefs           in marble.             To make now a definite application, it is evident that the           connection between vase-paintings and painted terracottas must           from the nature of the case be a very close one. But when these           terracottas are found to reproduce throughout the exact designs           and figures of vase-paintings, the line between the two fades           away. All the most familiar ornaments of vase technic recur  Page 32  again and again, maeanders, palmettes, lotuses, the scale and           lattice-work patterns, the bar-and-tooth ornament, besides           spirals of all descriptions. In exception, also, the parallel           is quite as close. In the great acroterium of the Heraion, for           example, the surface was first covered with a dark varnish-like           coating on which the drawing was incised down to the original           clay. Then the outlines were filled in black, red and white.           Here the bearing becomes clear of an incidental remark of           Pausanias in his description of Olympia. He says (v. 10.):           [Greek: en de Olympia] (of the Zeus temple) [Greek: lebes           epichrysos epi ecastô tou orophou tô perati epikeitai]. That           is originally aeroteria were only vases set up at the apex and           on the end of the gable. Naturally enough the later           terracottas would keep close to the old tradition.             [Footnote 48: _Cf. supra, Programm zum Winckelmannsfeste_.]             [Footnote 49: I, 3. 1.]             [Footnote 50: His. Nat., xxxv, 158.]             [Footnote 51: _Ausgrabungen zu Olympia_, v, 35 and _Taf_.           XXXIV.]             It is interesting also to find relief-work in terracotta as           well as painting on a plane surface. An example where color and           relief thus unite, which comes from a temple in Caere,[52]           might very well have been copied from a vase design. It           represents a female face in relief, as occurs so often in Greek           pottery, surrounded by an ornament of lotus, maeander and           palmette. Such a raised surface is far from unusual; and we           seem to find here an intermediate stage between painting and           sculpture. The step is indeed a slight one. A terracotta           figurine[53] from Tarentum helps to make the connection           complete. It is moulded fully in the round, but by way of           adornment, in close agreement with the tradition of           vase-painting, the head is wreathed with rosettes and crowned           by a single palmette. So these smaller covering plates just           spoken of, which were devoted to minor uses, recall continually           not only the identical manner of representation but the           identical scenes of vase paintings,--such favorite subjects, to           cite only one example, as the meeting of Agamemnon's children           at his tomb.             [Footnote 52: _Arch. Zeitung_, xxix, 1872, _Taf._ 41; RAYET et           COLLIGNON, _Hist. Céram. Grecque_, fig. 143.]             [Footnote 53: _Arch. Zeitung_, 1882, _Taf._ 13.]             From this point of view, it does not seem impossible that           pedimental groups might have fallen under the influence of vase           technic. The whole architectural adornment of the oldest temple           was of pottery. It covered the cornice of the sides, completely  Page 33  bounded the pedimental space, above and below, and finally           crowned the whole structure in the acroteria. It would surely           be strange if the pedimental group, framed in this way by vase           designs, were in no way influenced by them. The painted           decoration of these terracottas is that of the bounding friezes           in vase-pictures. The vase-painter employs them to frame and           set off the central scene. Might not the same end have been           served by the terracottas on the temple, with reference to the           scene within the typanum? We must remember, also, that at this           early time the sculptor's art was in its infancy while painting           and the ceramic art had reached a considerable development.           Even if all analogy did not lead the other way, an artist would           shrink from trying to fill up a pediment with statues in the           round. The most natural method was also the easiest for him.             On the question of the original character of the pedimental           group, the Heraion at Olympia, probably the oldest Greek           columnar structure known, furnishes important light. Pausanias           says nothing whatever of any pedimental figures. Of course his           silence does not prove that there were none; but with all the           finds of acroteria, terracottas and the like, no trace of any           such sculptures was discovered. The inference seems certain           that the pedimental decoration, if present at all, was either           of wood or of terracotta, or was merely painted on a smooth           surface. The weight of authority inclines to the last view. It           is held that, if artists had become accustomed to carving           pedimental groups in wood, the first examples that we"]]]
