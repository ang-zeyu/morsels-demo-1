Tales of sights and sounds,  strange and terrible, connected with the huge black tombs, were a very  great security to the grounds about them, for few of the slaves felt  like approaching them even in the day time. It was a dark, gloomy and  forbidding place, and it was difficult to feel that the spirits of the  sleeping dust there deposited, reigned with the blest in the realms of  eternal peace.    The business of twenty or thirty farms was transacted at this, called,  by way of eminence, \"great house farm.\" These farms all belonged to  Col. Lloyd, as did, also, the slaves upon them. Each farm was under the  management of an overseer. As I have said of the overseer of the home  plantation, so I may say of the overseers on the smaller ones; they  stand between the slave and all civil constitutions--their word is law,  and is implicitly obeyed.    The colonel, at this time, was reputed to be, and he apparently was,  very rich. His slaves, alone, were an immense fortune. These, small and  great, could not have been fewer than one thousand in number, and though  scarcely a month passed without the sale of one or more lots to the  Georgia traders, there was no apparent diminution in the number of his  human stock: the home plantation merely groaned at a removal of the  young increase, or human crop, then proceeded as lively as ever.  Horse-shoeing, cart-mending, plow-repairing, coopering, grinding, and  weaving, for all the neighboring farms, were performed here, and slaves  were employed in all these branches. \"Uncle Tony\" was the blacksmith;  \"Uncle Harry\" was the cartwright; \"Uncle Abel\" was the shoemaker; and  all these had hands to assist them in their several departments.    These mechanics were called \"uncles\" by all the younger slaves, not  because they really sustained that relationship to any, but according to  plantation _etiquette_, as a mark of respect, due{54} from the younger  to the older slaves. Strange, and even ridiculous as it may seem, among  a people so uncultivated, and with so many stern trials to look in  the face, there is not to be found, among any people, a more rigid  enforcement of the law of respect to elders, than they maintain. I  set this down as partly constitutional with my race, and partly  conventional. There is no better material in the world for making a  gentleman, than is furnished in the African. He shows to others, and  exacts for himself, all the tokens of respect which he is compelled to  manifest toward his master. A young slave must approach the company  of the older with hat in hand, and woe betide him, if he fails to  acknowledge a favor, of any sort, with the accustomed _\"tank'ee,\"_ &c.  So uniformly are good manners enforced among slaves, I can easily detect  a \"bogus\" fugitive by his manners.    Among other slave notabilities of the plantation, was one called by  everybody Uncle Isaac Copper. It is seldom that a slave gets a surname  from anybody in Maryland; and so completely has the south shaped the  manners of the north, in this respect, that even abolitionists make very  little of the surname of a Negro. The only improvement on the \"Bills,\"  \"Jacks,\" \"Jims,\" and \"Neds\" of the south, observable here is, that  \"William,\" \"John,\" \"James,\" \"Edward,\" are substituted. It goes against  the grain to treat and address a Negro precisely as they would treat  and address a white man. But, once in a while, in slavery as in the  free states, by some extraordinary circumstance, the Negro has a surname  fastened to him, and holds it against all conventionalities. This was  the case with Uncle Isaac Copper. When the \"uncle\" was dropped, he  generally had the prefix \"doctor,\" in its stead. He was our doctor of  medicine, and doctor of divinity as well. Where he took his degree I am  unable to say, for he was not very communicative to inferiors, and I was  emphatically such, being but a boy seven or eight years old. He was too  well established in his profession to permit questions as to his native  skill, or his attainments. One qualification he undoubtedly had--he{55  PRAYING AND FLOGGING} was a confirmed _cripple;_ and he could neither  work, nor would he bring anything if offered for sale in the market.  The old man, though lame, was no sluggard. He was a man that made his  crutches do him good service. He was always on the alert, looking up the  sick, and all such as were supposed to need his counsel. His remedial  prescriptions embraced four articles. For diseases of the body, _Epsom  salts and castor oil;_ for those of the soul, _the Lord's Prayer_, and  _hickory switches_!    I was not long at Col. Lloyd's before I was placed under the care of  Doctor Issac Copper. I was sent to him with twenty or thirty other  children, to learn the \"Lord's Prayer.\" I found the old gentleman seated  on a huge three-legged oaken stool, armed with several large hickory  switches; and, from his position, he could reach--lame as he was--any  boy in the room. After standing awhile to learn what was expected of us,  the old gentleman, in any other than a devotional tone, commanded us  to kneel down. This done, he commenced telling us to say everything  he said. \"Our Father\"--this was repeated after him with promptness  and uniformity; \"Who art in heaven\"--was less promptly and uniformly  repeated; and the old gentleman paused in the prayer, to give us a short  lecture upon the consequences of inattention, both immediate and future,  and especially those more immediate. About these he was absolutely  certain, for he held in his right hand the means of bringing all his  predictions and warnings to pass. On he proceeded with the prayer; and  we with our thick tongues and unskilled ears, followed him to the best  of our ability. This, however, was not sufficient to please the old  gentleman. Everybody, in the south, wants the privilege of whipping  somebody else. Uncle Isaac shared the common passion of his country,  and, therefore, seldom found any means of keeping his disciples in  order short of flogging. \"Say everything I say;\" and bang would come  the switch on some poor boy's undevotional head. _\"What you looking at  there\"--\"Stop that pushing\"_--and down again would come the lash.{56}    The whip is all in all. It is supposed to secure obedience to the  slaveholder, and is held as a sovereign remedy among the slaves  themselves, for every form of disobedience, temporal or spiritual.  Slaves, as well as slaveholders, use it with an unsparing hand. Our  devotions at Uncle Isaac's combined too much of the tragic and comic, to  make them very salutary in a spiritual point of view; and it is due  to truth to say, I was often a truant when the time for attending the  praying and flogging of Doctor Isaac Copper came on.    The windmill under the care of Mr. Kinney, a kind hearted old  Englishman, was to me a source of infinite interest and pleasure. The  old man always seemed pleased when he saw a troop of darkey little  urchins, with their tow-linen shirts fluttering in the breeze,  approaching to view and admire the whirling wings of his wondrous  machine. From the mill we could see other objects of deep interest.  These were, the vessels from St. Michael's, on their way to Baltimore.  It was a source of much amusement to view the flowing sails and  complicated rigging, as the little crafts dashed by, and to speculate  upon Baltimore, as to the kind and quality of the place. With so many  sources of interest around me, the reader may be prepared to learn that  I began to think very highly of Col. L.'s plantation. It was just a  place to my boyish taste. There were fish to be caught in the creek, if  one only had a hook and line; and crabs, clams and oysters were to be  caught by wading, digging and raking for them. Here was a field for  industry and enterprise, strongly inviting; and the reader may be  assured that I entered upon it with spirit.    Even the much dreaded old master, whose merciless fiat had brought me  from Tuckahoe, gradually, to my mind, parted with his terrors. Strange  enough, his reverence seemed to take no particular notice of me, nor of  my coming. Instead of leaping out and devouring me, he scarcely seemed  conscious of my presence. The fact is, he was occupied with matters  more weighty and important than either looking after or vexing me. He  probably thought as{57 \"OLD MASTER\" LOSING ITS TERRORS} little of my  advent, as he would have thought of the addition of a single pig to his  stock!    As the chief butler on Col. Lloyd's plantation, his duties were numerous  and perplexing. In almost all important matters he answered in Col.  Lloyd's stead. The overseers of all the farms were in some sort under  him, and received the law from his mouth. The colonel himself seldom  addressed an overseer, or allowed an overseer to address him. Old master  carried the keys of all store houses; measured out the allowance for  each slave at the end of every month; superintended the storing of all  goods brought to the plantation; dealt out the raw material to all the  handicraftsmen; shipped the grain, tobacco, and all saleable produce of  the plantation to market, and had the general oversight of the coopers'  shop, wheelwrights' shop, blacksmiths' shop, and shoemakers' shop.  Besides the care of these, he often had business for the plantation  which required him to be absent two and three days.    Thus largely employed, he had little time, and perhaps as little  disposition, to interfere with the children individually. What he was to  Col. Lloyd, he made Aunt Katy to him. When he had anything to say or do  about us, it was said or done in a wholesale manner; disposing of us in  classes or sizes, leaving all minor details to Aunt Katy, a person of  whom the reader has already received no"]]]
