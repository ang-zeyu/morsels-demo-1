The appearance of the central column with a base in the  Early English and its capital with the Norman ornament might be added: the  stairs to the crypt, and the discovery of several most interesting relics  in the adjoining vaults opened in reducing the floor to its original  level.\"              [Illustration: SECTION THROUGH LADY CHAPEL AND CRYPT.]                      SECTION THROUGH LADY CHAPEL AND CRYPT.             [Illustration: ARCH DISCOVERED AT ENTRANCE OF LADY CHAPEL.]                   ARCH DISCOVERED AT ENTRANCE OF LADY CHAPEL.      It was as a memorial to Dean Merewether, to whom the cathedral owes so  much, that the stained glass designed by Cottingham was placed in the east  windows in the narrow lancets that he loved so dearly. It represents  scenes in the early life of the Virgin and the life of Christ; the last  being the supper in the house of Mary and Martha. In the side windows the  visitor should especially notice the rich clustered shafts and arches, the  Early English capitals, and the ornamentation of the arches. Above these  windows, corresponding to the openings above the east window, a quatrefoil  opening enclosed by a circle pierces the wall. The quadripartite vaulting  springs from slender shafts, which descend upon a slightly raised base.    The double piscina and aumbry south of the altar are restorations  necessitated by the dilapidated state of the originals.    *Monuments in the Lady Chapel.*--Of great beauty and interest is the  Perpendicular recess in the central bay on the north side of the Lady  Chapel, in which is the recumbent effigy which tradition has assigned  without evidence to Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, who died in the  46th year of the reign of Edward III., 1372. He was, however, buried in  the north side of the Presbytery in Walden Abbey, Essex.    The Rev. Francis Havergal considers this to be the monument of Peter,  Baron de Grandisson, who died 1358. In any case, the knight was probably  one of the Bohun family, and husband of the lady whose effigy lies under  an arch in the wall adjoining. The costume is of the earlier part of the  fourteenth century; full armour, and covered (a rare example) by a  cyclass, a close linen shirt worn over the armour in Edward III.'s reign.  This shirt is cut short in front and about 6 inches longer behind. The  visitor should also notice the fringed poleyns at the knees.    The upper story of the recess itself has open tabernacle-work, now  containing a series of figures representing the crowning of the Virgin; on  one side are figures of King Ethelbert and St. John the Baptist, and on  the other St. Thomas a Becket (with double crozier) and Bishop Thomas de  Cantilupe. Of these, however, only the two central carvings are in their  original positions, the others having been discovered by Mr. Cottingham  when the oak choir-screen was removed.    In the easternmost bay on this side is the tomb of Joanna de Bohun,  Countess of Hereford, 1327. To quote from Dean Merewether: \"The effigy of  the lady, there can be scarcely a doubt, represents 'Johanna de Bohun,  Domina de Kilpec.' She was the sister and heiress of Alan Plonknett or  Plugenet of Kilpec, in the county of Hereford, a name distinguished in the  annals of his times; and of his possessions, his sister doing her homage,  had livery 19 Edward II.    \"In 1327 Johanna de Bohun gave to the Dean and Chapter of Hereford, the  church of Lugwardyne, with the chapels of Llangarren, St. Waynards and  Henthland, with all the small chapels belonging to them, which donation  was confirmed by the king by the procurement and diligence of Thomas de  Chandos, Archdeacon of Hereford; and the Bishop of Hereford further  confirmed it to the Dean and Chapter by deed, dated Lugwas, 22nd July,  1331 (ex Regist. MS. Thomae Chorleton, Epi.): And afterwards the Bishop,  Dean and Chapter appropriated the revenues of it to the service peculiar  to the Virgin Mary, 'because in other churches in England the Mother of  God had better and more serious service, but in the Church of Hereford the  Ladye's sustenance for her prieste was so thinne and small, that out of  their respect they add this, by their deeds, dated in the Chapter at  Hereford, April 10th, 1333.' (Harl. MS. 6726, fol. 109.)    \"Johanna de Bohoun died without issue, 1 Edward III., 1327, the donation  of Lugwardyne being perhaps her dying bequest. On the 17th of October in  that year, she constituted John de Badesshawe, her attorney, to give  possession to the Dean and Chapter of an acre of land in Lugwardine, and  the advowson of the church with the chapels pertaining to it. This  instrument was dated at Bisseleye, and her seal was appended, of which a  sketch is preserved by Taylor, in whose possession this document appears  to have been in 1655, and a transcript of it will be found Harl. MS. 6868,  f. 77 (see also 6726, f. 109, which last has been printed in _Shaw's  Topographer_, 1. 280).    \"In the tower is preserved the patent 1 Edward III., pro Ecclesia de  Lugwarden cum capellis donandis a Johanna de Bohun ad inveniendum 8  capellanos et 2 diaconos approprianda (Tanner's _Notitia Monast._).                    [Illustration: SEAL OF JOHANNA DE BOHUN.]                            SEAL OF JOHANNA DE BOHUN.      \"The circumstances above mentioned appear sufficiently to explain why the  memorial of Johanna de Bohoun is found in the Lady Chapel, to which  especially she had been a benefactress. They also explain the original  ornaments of this tomb, the painting which was to be seen not many years  since under the arch in which the effigy lies, now unfortunately concealed  by a coat of plaster, of which sufficient has been removed to prove that  Gough's description of the original state of the painting is correct. He  says, 'The Virgin is represented sitting, crowned with a nimbus; a lady  habited in a mantle and wimple kneeling on an embroidered cushion offers  to her a church built in the form of a cross, with a central spire--and  behind the lady kneel eleven or twelve religious, chanting a gorge  deployee after the foremost, who holds up a book, on which are seen  musical notes and \"salve sca parens.\" Fleur-de-lys are painted about both  within and without this arch, and on the spandrils two shields; on the  left, a bend cotised between twelve Lioncels (Bohun); and on the right,  Ermines, a bend indented, Gules.' This description was published 1786.    \"By this painting there can be no doubt that the donation of the church of  Lugwardine was represented; the eleven or twelve vociferous choristers  were the eight chaplains and two deacons mentioned in the patent, who were  set apart for the peculiar service of the Lady Chapel, and provided for  from the pious bequest of Johanna de Bohoun. The two shields mentioned by  Gough are still discernible, that on the dexter side bearing the arms of  Bohun, Azure a bend, Argent between two cotises, and six lions rampant,  or.--The other, Ermines, a bend indented, (or fusily) Gules, which were the  bearings of Plugenet, derived perhaps originally from the earlier Barons  of Kilpec, and still borne by the family of Pye in Herefordshire, whose  descent is traced to the same source. In the list of obits observed in  Hereford Cathedral, Johanna is called the Lady Kilpeck, and out of  Lugwardine was paid yearly for her obit forty pence.\"    The effigy of Joanna de Bohun is also valuable as a specimen of costume.  Its curious decoration of human heads is also noteworthy.    Over the grave of Dean Merewether, who is interred at the north-east angle  of the chapel, is a black marble slab with a brass by Hardman bearing an  inscription, which records that to the restoration of the cathedral \"he  devoted the unwearied energies of his life till its close on the 4th of  April 1850.\"    The next monument to notice is the effigy of Dean Berew or Beaurieu (died  1462) in the south wall of the vestibule. This is one of the best  specimens of monumental sculpture in the cathedral. The face, which is  well modelled, and the arrangement of the drapery at the feet, are  especially noticeable. There are remains of colour over the whole  monument. In the hollow of the arch-moulding are sixteen boars with rue  leaves in their mouths, forming a \"rebus\" of the dean's name.    To the west of this monument is the effigy of a priest, supposed to be  Canon de la Barr, 1386.    *The Audley Chantry.*--In the central bay on the south side of the wall is  the Audley Chantry--a beautiful little chapel built by Bishop Edmund Audley  (1492-1502), with an upper chamber to which access is obtained by a  circular staircase at the south-west angle.    After Bishop Audley's translation to Salisbury in 1502 he erected a  similar chantry in that cathedral wherein he was buried, so that the  object of the Hereford Chantry as the place for his interment was of  course never fulfilled.    The following is an extract taken from the calendar of an ancient  missal:--\"_Secundum usum"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19494"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Albans (#11)"],[1,"ury. The next bay is largely rebuilt; on  the south side is a door and opposite is the back of John of  Wheathampstead's chantry. From this we pass into the south aisle of the  Saint's Chapel.    [Illustration: SOUTH AISLE OF PRESBYTERY.]    First we see the doorway on the north side, under which are steps  leading up into the chapel, and further on we come to a trellis-work of  iron through which we can look across the space once occupied by the  monument of \"Good\" Duke Humphrey of Gloucester into the Saint's Chapel.  This grill is older (about 1275) than the rich canopy over the duke's  grave, and was doubtless erected to allow of a view being obtained from  this aisle of the martyr's shrine. There are a number of figures of  kings in the canopied niches over the grave, but it is not possible to  identify them. Opposite are some remains of a stone screen of the  Perpendicular period; it probably divided the aisle from some external  chapel. After the chapel perished the wall was built up; but during the  restoration this arcading was discovered. Through an oak screen, Lord  Grimthorpe's work, we pass into the #retro-choir.# This, as we have  before seen, was sadly mutilated after the Reformation, when the public  path was made through this part of the building and the Lady Chapel  turned into a grammar school; hence we shall find more modern work here  than in any other equal area of the church. The part east of the passage  was for long used as a covered playground for the boys and suffered much  in consequence. It was originally built at the end of the thirteenth  century. The arcading round these walls is new, much of it carved under  the direction of Lord Grimthorpe by Mr. John Baker. The carving is of a  naturalistic character, the vegetable forms being copied direct from the  plants and trees of the neighbourhood. The oak ceiling of the south side  and the flat ceiling of the centre are by Lord Grimthorpe; that on the  north side by Sir Gilbert Scott. The shrine of St. Amphibalus once stood  in the centre, but the reconstructed shrine, or rather pedestal of the  shrine, was removed to the north aisle of the Saint's Chapel by Lord  Grimthorpe, so as to be out of the way; for his idea was to fit this  part of the church for use as a chapter-house, should a chapter ever be  created, and as a consistory court. He built the low wall between it and  the Saint's Chapel with seats under the arcading to be occupied by  members of the chapter, and paved the floor with polished marble (see  illustration, p. 64).    [Illustration: WOODEN FIGURE OF A MENDICANT.]    [Illustration: RETRO-CHOIR]    There were once several altars in this retro-choir; under the east  window on the south side one to our Lady of the Four Tapers, with an  aumbry and triple-arched piscina in the south wall. This has been  restored; the upper part is entirely new. On the north side in a  corresponding position was an altar dedicated to St. Michael; while  altars dedicated to St. Edmund, King and Martyr, and to St. Peter stood  to the west of the two pillars, respectively on the north and south  sides; and another altar to St. Amphibalus stood to the west of his  shrine in the centre. It may here be noted that the east wall of the  original Norman apse extended as far as the centre of the retro-choir.    [Illustration: BASE OF THE SHRINE OF ST. AMPHIBALUS.]    [Illustration: BACK OF THE WATCHING LOFT.]    [Illustration: RAMRYGE'S CHANTRY FROM THE AISLE.]    The north aisle of the Saint's Chapel is divided from the retro-choir by  a glazed oak screen with a door in it, frequently kept locked. Just to  the west of this is the pedestal of the shrine of St. Amphibalus. This,  like that of St. Alban's shrine, was broken up into many fragments after  the dissolution of the monastery. The fragments were built into sundry  walls, but many of them were discovered when the walls blocking up the  arches at the east end of the Saint's Chapel were removed; they were put  together as far as possible, but as the east and north sides are  missing, the position the pedestal now occupies is not an unfitting one,  as these sides are hidden (see illustration, p. 65). The letters R.W.  may be seen on it. These are the initials of Ralph Whitechurch, sacrist,  at whose cost the pedestal was built in the second half of the  fourteenth century. Opposite this we see the back of the watching loft  (see illustration, p. 66) erected for the monk who kept watch and ward  over the martyr's shrine; further to the west is a doorway into the  Saint's Chapel, and still further west the back of Ramryge's chantry.  Beyond this is the north entrance into the presbytery, over which is a  painting of the Lord's Supper, generally attributed to Sir James  Thornhill and given to the church about two centuries ago; at one time  it hung over the high altar. There is also a painting of Offa, probably  fifteenth-century work, to be seen in this aisle. The two doors removed  by Lord Grimthorpe from the central doorway of the west front have been  set up against the west end of the walls of this aisle (see  illustration).    [Illustration: ONE OF THE OLD WESTERN DOORS.]    #The Lady Chapel.#--This chapel in its original condition must have been  exceedingly beautiful; and although we have had occasion to find much  fault with the work of restoration or rather destruction and needless  alteration, in other parts of the church, yet here little but praise can  be bestowed. Some may regret that the old wooden vaulting was not  retained and repaired, but the new stone vaulting is beautiful in itself  and more durable. A better material than cast iron might, however, have  been found for the altar rails. The new carving is excellent in quality  and right in principle. It has been done, not as most modern work is, by  imitating the carved work of some particular period of architecture as  set out for the carver in the architect's drawings, but by returning to  the old system of going to nature and carving from life models, so to  say. It has been done in the same spirit as actuated the early work of  the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. It is said that the carvers had sprays  of leaves and clusters of fruit and flowers before them as they carved,  and imitated them as closely as the material on which they worked  allowed them to do. Work done in this manner, provided the carver has  skill and taste, is sure to show character and life, and to differ  entirely from the mechanical conventionalisms we generally see in modern  stone-carving.    [Illustration: LADY CHAPEL.]    The chapel dates from the latter part of the thirteenth and early part  of the fourteenth centuries. The work was probably begun in the time of  Abbot Roger Norton, whose body was buried before the high altar in the  presbytery, but whose heart was laid in a small box, which was  discovered during the restoration, before the altar of St. Mary of the  Four Tapers. Possibly his successor, John of Berkhampstead, carried on  the work; but at Abbot Hugh's accession in 1308 the walls of the Lady  Chapel had only been carried up as high as the string-course below the  windows. The work of building was not continuous, as change in style  shows; moreover we read in the Chronicles that Abbot Hugh of Eversden  \"brought to a praiseworthy completion the Chapel of the Virgin in the  eastern part of the church which had been begun many-years before.\" He  is also recorded to have roofed the space to the west, that is, the  retro-choir. It seems, then, that at the time when the alterations in  the eastern part of the Norman church were begun, not only was the  presbytery with its aisles laid out, but also the retro-choir as a group  of chapels, and possibly the Lady Chapel as well; and that when Hugh was  chosen Abbot he found the presbytery and Saint's Chapel finished, the  walls of the retro-choir raised to their full height, and those of the  Lady Chapel partly built. These he proceeded to finish. The side windows  of the Lady Chapel are beautiful examples of the fully developed  Decorated style; the jambs and mullions are ornamented with statuettes  which, strange to say, escaped destruction. \"The eastern window of five  lights is a singular combination of tracery with tabernacle work, while  the easternmost bay on the south side, which is partly obscured by the  vestry, has an exquisite window above, consisting of a richly traceried  arch placed within a curvilinear triangle, beneath which is a splendid  range of niches, and, beneath them again, a gorgeous range of sedilia  and piscinae.\"[9] The original wall arcading had cinque-foiled heads on  the south side, and trefoiled heads on the north; but all these had been  cut away before the restoration began, probably at the time when the  walls were covered with panels to make the chapel more suitable for a  schoolroom.        [9] Sir Gilbert Scott's Report on the Lady Chapel, 1875.    In this chapel, after its dedication, mass was sung daily, and an organ  was provided to accompany the musical part of the service. The western  end of the Lady Chapel was separated from the retro-choir by a screen,  which of course perished after the dissolution. No modern screen has  been put in its place, though one would be a great improvement.  Projecting from the easternmost bay of the south side stands the Chapel  of the Transfiguration, which was dedicated in 1430. This, rebuilt, is  now used as a vestry. Beneath the floor of the Lady Chapel was buried  the hated Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, grand-son of John of Gaunt;  Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, son of the famous Hotspur; and  Thomas, Lord Clifford: whose bodies were found lying dead in the streets  of St. Albans, after the first battle in 1455, in which they fell  fighting for the Red Rose party. They were buried by Abbot John of  Wheathampstead, who at this time was an adherent of that party, though  he became a Yorkist after Queen"]]]
