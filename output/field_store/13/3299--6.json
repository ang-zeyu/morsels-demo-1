And some say that the Godhead is said to have dwelt in  Christ corporeally, i.e. in three ways, just as a body has three  dimensions: first, by essence, presence, and power, as in other  creatures; secondly, by sanctifying grace, as in the saints; thirdly,  by personal union, which is proper to Christ.    Hence the reply to the third is manifest, viz. because the union of  the Incarnation did not take place by habitual grace alone, but in  subsistence or person.  _______________________    ELEVENTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 2, Art. 11]    Whether Any Merits Preceded the Union of the Incarnation?    Objection 1: It would seem that the union of the Incarnation followed  upon certain merits, because upon Ps. 32:22, \"Let Thy mercy, o Lord,  be upon us, as,\" etc. a gloss says: \"Here the prophet's desire for  the Incarnation and its merited fulfilment are hinted at.\" Therefore  the Incarnation falls under merit.    Obj. 2: Further, whoever merits anything merits that without which it  cannot be. But the ancient Fathers merited eternal life, to which  they were able to attain only by the Incarnation; for Gregory says  (Moral. xiii): \"Those who came into this world before Christ's  coming, whatsoever eminency of righteousness they may have had, could  not, on being divested of the body, at once be admitted into the  bosom of the heavenly country, seeing that He had not as yet come  Who, by His own descending, should place the souls of the righteous  in their everlasting seat.\" Therefore it would seem that they merited  the Incarnation.    Obj. 3: Further, of the Blessed Virgin it is sung that \"she merited  to bear the Lord of all\" [*Little Office of B. V. M., Dominican Rite,  Ant. at Benedictus], and this took place through the Incarnation.  Therefore the Incarnation falls under merit.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Praed. Sanct. xv): \"Whoever can  find merits preceding the singular generation of our Head, may also  find merits preceding the repeated regeneration of us His members.\"  But no merits preceded our regeneration, according to Titus 3:5: \"Not  by the works of justice which we have done, but according to His  mercy He saved us, by the laver of regeneration.\" Therefore no merits  preceded the generation of Christ.    _I answer that,_ With regard to Christ Himself, it is clear from the  above (A. 10) that no merits of His could have preceded the union.  For we do not hold that He was first of all a mere man, and that  afterwards by the merits of a good life it was granted Him to become  the Son of God, as Photinus held; but we hold that from the beginning  of His conception this man was truly the Son of God, seeing that He  had no other hypostasis but that of the Son of God, according to Luke  1:35: \"The Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son  of God.\" And hence every operation of this man followed the union.  Therefore no operation of His could have been meritorious of the  union.    Neither could the needs of any other man whatsoever have merited this  union condignly: first, because the meritorious works of man are  properly ordained to beatitude, which is the reward of virtue, and  consists in the full enjoyment of God. Whereas the union of the  Incarnation, inasmuch as it is in the personal being, transcends the  union of the beatified mind with God, which is by the act of the soul  in fruition; and therefore it cannot fall under merit. Secondly,  because grace cannot fall under merit, for the principle of merit  does not fall under merit; and therefore neither does grace, for it  is the principle of merit. Hence, still less does the Incarnation  fall under merit, since it is the principle of grace, according to  John 1:17: \"Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.\" Thirdly, because  the Incarnation is for the reformation of the entire human nature,  and therefore it does not fall under the merit of any individual man,  since the goodness of a mere man cannot be the cause of the good of  the entire nature. Yet the holy Fathers merited the Incarnation  congruously by desiring and beseeching; for it was becoming that God  should harken to those who obeyed Him.    And thereby the reply to the First Objection is manifest.    Reply Obj. 2: It is false that under merit falls everything without  which there can be no reward. For there is something pre-required not  merely for reward, but also for merit, as the Divine goodness and  grace and the very nature of man. And again, the mystery of the  Incarnation is the principle of merit, because \"of His fulness we all  have received\" (John 1:16).    Reply Obj. 3: The Blessed Virgin is said to have merited to bear the  Lord of all; not that she merited His Incarnation, but because by the  grace bestowed upon her she merited that grade of purity and  holiness, which fitted her to be the Mother of God.  _______________________    TWELFTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 2, Art. 12]    Whether the Grace of Union Was Natural to the Man Christ?    Objection 1: It would seem that the grace of union was not natural to  the man Christ. For the union of the Incarnation did not take place  in the nature, but in the Person, as was said above (A. 2). Now a  thing is denominated from its terminus. Therefore this grace ought  rather to be called personal than natural.    Obj. 2: Further, grace is divided against nature, even as gratuitous  things, which are from God, are distinguished from natural things,  which are from an intrinsic principle. But if things are divided in  opposition to one another, one is not denominated by the other.  Therefore the grace of Christ was not natural to Him.    Obj. 3: Further, natural is that which is according to nature. But  the grace of union is not natural to Christ in regard to the Divine  Nature, otherwise it would belong to the other Persons; nor is it  natural to Him according to the human nature, otherwise it would  belong to all men, since they are of the same nature as He. Therefore  it would seem that the grace of union is nowise natural to Christ.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (Enchiridion xl): \"In the  assumption of human nature, grace itself became somewhat natural to  that man, so as to leave no room for sin in Him.\"    _I answer that,_ According to the Philosopher (Metaph. v, 5), nature  designates, in one way, nativity; in another, the essence of a thing.  Hence natural may be taken in two ways: first, for what is only from  the essential principles of a thing, as it is natural to fire to  mount; secondly, we call natural to man what he has had from his  birth, according to Eph. 2:3: \"We were by nature children of wrath\";  and Wis. 12:10: \"They were a wicked generation, and their malice  natural.\" Therefore the grace of Christ, whether of union or  habitual, cannot be called natural as if caused by the principles of  the human nature of Christ, although it may be called natural, as if  coming to the human nature of Christ by the causality of His Divine  Nature. But these two kinds of grace are said to be natural to  Christ, inasmuch as He had them from His nativity, since from the  beginning of His conception the human nature was united to the Divine  Person, and His soul was filled with the gift of grace.    Reply Obj. 1: Although the union did not take place in the nature,  yet it was caused by the power of the Divine Nature, which is truly  the nature of Christ, and it, moreover, belonged to Christ from the  beginning of His nativity.    Reply Obj. 2: The union is not said to be grace and natural in the  same respect; for it is called grace inasmuch as it is not from  merit; and it is said to be natural inasmuch as by the power of the  Divine Nature it was in the humanity of Christ from His nativity.    Reply Obj. 3: The grace of union is not natural to Christ according  to His human nature, as if it were caused by the principles of the  human nature, and hence it need not belong to all men. Nevertheless,  it is natural to Him in regard to the human nature on account of the  _property_ of His birth, seeing that He was conceived by the Holy  Ghost, so that He might be the natural Son of God and of man. But it  is natural to Him in regard to the Divine Nature, inasmuch as the  Divine Nature is the active principle of this grace; and this belongs  to the whole Trinity--to wit, to be the active principle of this  grace.  _______________________    QUESTION 3    OF THE MODE OF UNION ON THE PART OF THE PERSON ASSUMING  (In Eight Articles)    We must now consider the union on the part of the Person assuming,  and under this head there are eight points of inquiry:    (1) Whether to assume is befitting to a Divine Person?    (2) Whether it is befitting to the Divine Nature?    (3) Whether the Nature abstracted from the Personality can assume?    (4) Whether one Person can assume without another?    (5) Whether each Person can assume?    (6) Whether several Persons can assume one individual nature?    (7) Whether one Person can assume two individual natures?    (8) Whether it was more fitting for the Person of the Son of God to  assume human nature than for another Divine Person?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [III, Q. 3, Art. 1]    Whether It Is Befitting for a Divine Person to Assume?    Objection 1: It would seem that it is not befitting to a Divine  Person to assume a created nature. For a Divine Person signifies  something most perfect. Now no addition can be made to what is  perfect. Therefore, since to assume is to take to oneself, and  consequently what is assumed is added to the one who assumes, it does  not seem to be befitting to a Divine Person to assume a created  nature.    Obj. 2: Further, that to which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1996"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 2, Purgatory (#11)"],[1,"2] Oderisi of Gubbio and Franco of Bologna were both eminent in  the art called miniare in Italian, enluminer in French.

[8] Provinzano Salvani was one of the chief supporters of the  Ghibelline cause in Tuscany. He was a man of great qualities and  capacity, but proud and presumptuous. Defeated and taken prisoner  at the battle of Colle, in 1269, he was beheaded.    [9] The Campo of Siena is her chief public square and  marketplace, set round with palaces. The friend of Provinzano is  said by the old commentators to have fought for Conradin against  Charles of Anjou, and, being taken captive, to have been  condemned to death. His ransom was fixed at ten thousand florins.  Provinzano, not being able to pay this sum from his own means,  took his seat in the Campo and humiliated himself to beg of the  passers-by.    [10] The meaning of the dark words seems to be: Exile and poverty  will compel thee to beg, and begging to tremble in every vein.    [11] This deed of humility and charity released him from the  necessity of tarrying outside the gate of Purgatory.        CANTO XII.

Side by side, like oxen who go yoked, I went on with that  burdened spirit so long as the sweet Pedagogue allowed it; but  when he said, \"Leave him, and come on, for here it is well that,  both with sail and oars, each as much as he can should urge his  bark,\" I straitened up my body again, as is required for walking,  although my thoughts remained both bowed down and abated.    I was moving on, and following willingly the steps of my Master,  and both now were showing how light we were, when he said to me,  \"Turn thine eyes downward; it will be well for thee, in order to  solace the way, to look upon the bed of thy footprints.\" As above  the buried, so that there may be memory of them, their tombs in  earth bear inscribed that which they were before,--whence  oftentimes is weeping for them there, through the pricking of  remembrance, which only to the pious gives the spur,--so saw I  figured there, but of better semblance in respect of skill, all  that for pathway juts out from the mountain.    I saw him who was created more noble than any other creature,[1]  down from heaven with lightning flash descending, at one side.    [1] Lucifer.      I saw Briareus[1] transfixed by the celestial bolt, lying at the  other side, heavy upon the earth in mortal chill. I saw  Thymbraeus,[2] I saw Pallas and Mars, still armed, around their  father, gazing at the scattered limbs of the giants.    [1] Examples from classic and biblical mythology alternate.    [2] Apollo, so called from his temple at Thymbra, not far from  Troy, where Achilles is said to have slain Paris. Virgil  (Georgics, iv. 323) uses this epithet.      I saw Nimrod at the foot of his great toil, as if bewildered, and  gazing at the people who in Shinar had with him been proud.    O Niobe! with what grieving eyes did I see thee portrayed upon  the road between thy seven and seven children slain!    O Saul! how on thine own sword here didst thou appear dead on  Gilboa, that after felt not rain or dew![1]    [1] I Samuel, xxxi. 4, and 2 Samuel, i. 24.      O mad Arachne,[1] so I saw thee already half spider, wretched on  the shreds of the work that to thy harm by thee was made!

O Rehoboam! here thine image seems not now to threaten, but full  of fear, a chariot bears it away before any one pursues it.[1]    [1] 1 Kings, xii. 13-18.      The hard pavement showed also how Alcmaeon made the ill-fated  ornament seem costly to his mother.[1]    [1] Amphiaraus, the soothsayer, foreseeing his own death if he  went to the Theban war, hid himself to avoid being forced to go.  His wife, Eriphyle, bribed by a golden necklace, betrayed his  hiding-place, and was killed by her son Alcmaeon, for thus  bringing about his father's death.      It showed how his sons threw themselves upon Sennacherib within  the temple, and how they left him there dead.[1]    [1] 2 Kings, xix. 37.      It showed the ruin and the cruel slaughter that Tomyris wrought,  when she said to Cyrus, \"For blood thou hast thirsted, and with  blood I fill thee.\"    [1] Herodotus (i. 214) tells how Tomyris, Queen of the  Massagetae, having defeated and slain Cyrus, filled a skin full  of human blood, and plunged his head in it with words such as  Dante reports, and which he derived from Orosius, Histor. ii. 7.      It showed how the Assyrians fled in rout after Holofernes was  killed, and also the remainder of the punishment.[1]    [1] Judith, xv. 1.      I saw Troy in ashes, and in caverns. O Ilion! how cast down and  abject the image which is there discerned showed thee!    What master has there been of pencil or of style that could draw  the shadows and the lines which there would make every subtile  genius wonder? Dead the dead, and the living seemed alive. He who  saw the truth saw not better than I all that I trod on while I  went bent down.--Now be ye proud, and go with haughty look, ye  sons of Eve, and bend not down your face so that ye may see your  evil path!    More of the mountain had now been circled by us, and of the sun's  course far more spent, than my mind, not disengaged, was aware,  when he, who always in advance attent was going on, began, \"Lift  up thy head; there is no more time for going thus abstracted. See  there an Angel, who is hastening to come toward us: see how from  the service of the day the sixth hand-maiden returns.[1] With  reverence adorn thine acts and thy face so that he may delight to  direct us upward. Think that this day never dawns again.\"    [1] The sixth hour of the day is coming to its end, near noon.      I was well used to his admonition ever to lose no time, so that  on that theme he could not speak to me obscurely.    To us came the beautiful creature, clothed in white, and in his  face such as seems the tremulous morning star. Its arms it  opened, and then it opened its wings; it said, \"Come: here at  hand are the steps, and easily henceforth one ascends. To this  invitation very few come. O human race, born to fly upward, why  before a little wind dost thou so fall?\"    He led us to where the rock was cut; here he struck his wings  across my forehead,[1] then promised me secure progress.    [1] Removing the first P that the Angel of the Gate had incised  on Dante's brow.      As on the right hand, in going up the mountain,[1] where sits the  church that dominates her the well-guided[2] city above  Rubaconte,[3] the bold flight of the ascent is broken by the  stairs, which were made in an age when the record and the stave  were secure,[4] in like manner, the bank which falls here very  steeply from the next round is slackened; but on this side and  that the high rock grazes.[5] As we turned our persons thither,  voices sang \"Beati pauperes spiritu\"[6] in such wise that speech  could not tell it. Ah, how different are these passes from those  of Hell! for here through songs one enters, and there below  through fierce lamentings.    [1] The hill of San Miniato, above Florence.    [2] Ironical.    [3] The upper bridge at Florence across the Arno, named after  Messer Rubaconte di Mandella, podesta of Florence, who laid the  first stone of it in 1237; now called the Ponte alle Grazie,  after a little chapel built upon it in 1471, and dedicated to Our  Lady of Grace.    [4] In the good old time when men were honest. In 1299 one  Messer Niccola Acciaioli, in order to conceal a fraudulent  transaction, had a leaf torn out from the public notorial record;  and about the same time an officer in charge of the revenue from  salt, for the sake of private gain, measured the salt he received  with an honest measure, but that which he sold with a measure  diminished by the removal of a stave.    [5] The stairway is so narrow.    [6] \"Blessed are the poor in spirit.\" As Dante passes from each  round of Purgatory, an angel removes the P which denotes the  special sin there purged away. And the removal is accompanied  with the words of one of the Beatitudes.      Now we were mounting up over the holy stairs, and it seemed to me  I was far more light than I had seemed on the plain before.  Whereon I, \"Master, say, what heavy thing has been lifted from  me, so that almost no weariness is felt by me as I go on?\" He  answered, \"When the P's that almost extinct[1] still remain on  thy countenance shall be, as one is, quite erased, thy feet will  be so conquered by good will that not only they will not feel  fatigue, but it will be delight to them to be urged up.\" Then I  did like those who are going with something on their head,  unknown by them unless the signs of others make them suspect;  wherefore the hand assists to ascertain, and seeks and finds, and  performs that office which cannot be accomplished by the sight;  and with the fingers of my right hand outspread, I found only six  those letters which he of the keys had encised upon my temples:  looking at which my Leader smiled.    [1] Almost extinct, because, as St. Thomas Aquinas says, \"Pride  by which we are chiefly turned from God is the first and the  origin of all sins.\" He adds, \"Pride is said to be the beginning  of every sin, not because every single sin has its source in  pride, but because every kind of sin is born of pride.\" Summa  Theol., II. 2, quaest. 162, art. 7.
