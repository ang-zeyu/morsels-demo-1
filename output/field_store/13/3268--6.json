To make boats to be that is his strength.--Stones are not  sculptured for him--nor statues whereon the double crown is placed;--he  is unseen;--no tribute is paid unto him and no offerings are brought  unto him,--he is not charmed by words of mystery;--the place of his  dwelling is unknown, nor can his shrine be found by virtue of magic  writings.    \"VI.--There is no house large enough for thee,--nor any who may  penetrate within thy heart!--Nevertheless, the generations of thy  children rejoice in thee--for thou dost rule as a king--whose decrees  are established for the whole earth,--who is manifest in presence of the  people of the South and of the North,--by whom the tears are washed from  every eye,--and who is lavish of his bounties.    \"VII.--Where sorrow was, there doth break forth joy--and every  heart rejoiceth. Sovku, the crocodile, the child of Nit, leaps for  gladness;[*]--for the Nine gods who accompany thee have ordered all  things,--the overflow giveth drink unto the fields--and maketh all men  valiant; one man taketh to drink of the labour of another,--without  charge being brought against him.[**]         * The goddess Nit, the heifer born from the midst of the       primordial waters, had two crocodiles as her children, which       are sometimes represented on the monuments as hanging from       her bosom. Both the part played by these animals, and the       reason for connecting them with the goddess, are still       imperfectly understood.         ** This is an allusion to the quarrels and lawsuits       resulting from the distribution of the water in years when       the Nile was poor or bad.    If the inundation is abundant,       disputes are at an end.    \"IX.--If thou dost enter in the midst of songs to go forth in the midst  of gladness,--if they dance with joy when thou comest forth out of the  unknown,--it is that thy heaviness is death and corruption.--And when  thou art implored to give the water of the year,--the people of the  Thebai'd and of the North are seen side by side,--each man with the  tools of his trade,--none tarrieth behind his neighbour;--of all  those who clothed themselves, no man clotheth himself (with festive  garments)--the children of Thot, the god of riches, no longer adorn  themselves with jewels,--nor the Nine gods, but they are in the  night!--As soon as thou hast answered by the rising,--each one anointeth  himself with perfumes.    \"X.--Establisher of true riches, desire of men,--here are seductive  words in order that thou mayest reply;--if thou dost answer mankind  by waves of the heavenly Ocean,--Napri, the grain-god, presents his  offering,--all the gods adore (thee),--the birds no longer descend upon  the hills;--though that which thy hand formeth were of gold--or in the  shape of a brick of silver,--it is not lapis-lazuli that we eat,--but  wheat is of more worth than precious stones.    \"XI.--They have begun to sing unto thee upon the harp,--they sing  unto thee keeping time with their hands,--and the generations of thy  children rejoice in thee, and they have filled thee with salutations of  praise;--for it is the god of Riches who adorneth the earth,--who maketh  barks to prosper in the sight of man--who rejoiceth the heart of women  with child--who loveth the increase of the flocks.    \"XII.--When thou art risen in the city of the Prince,--then is the rich  man filled--the small man (the poor) disdaineth the lotus,--all is solid  and of good quality,--all herbage is for his children.--Doth he forget  to give food?--prosperity forsaketh the dwellings,--and earth falleth  into a wasting sickness.\"    [Illustration: 055.jpg Libyan Mountains]    The word Nile is of uncertain origin. We have it from the Greeks,  and they took it from a people foreign to Egypt, either from the  Phoenicians, the Khiti, the Libyans, or from people of Asia Minor. When  the Egyptians themselves did not care to treat their river as the god  Hapi, they called it the sea, or the great river. They had twenty terms  or more by which to designate the different phases which it assumed  according to the seasons, but they would not have understood what was  meant had one spoken to them of the Nile. The name Egypt also is part  of the Hellenic tradition; perhaps it was taken from the temple-name of  Memphis, Haikuphtah, which barbarian coast tribes of the Mediterranean  must long have had ringing in their ears as that of the most important  and wealthiest town to be found upon the shores of their sea. The  Egyptians called themselves Bomitu, Botu, and their country Qimit, the  black land. Whence came they? How far off in time are we to carry back  the date of their arrival? The oldest monuments hitherto known scarcely  transport us further than six thousand years, yet they are of an art so  fine, so well determined in its main outlines, and reveal so ingeniously  combined a system of administration, government, and religion, that we  infer a long past of accumulated centuries behind them. It must always  be difficult to estimate exactly the length of time needful for a race  as gifted as were the Ancient Egyptians to rise from barbarism into a  high degree of culture. Nevertheless, I do not think that we shall be  misled in granting them forty or fifty centuries wherein to bring so  complicated an achievement to a successful issue, and in placing their  first appearance at eight or ten thousand years before our era.  Their earliest horizon was a very limited one. Their gaze might wander  westward over the ravine-furrowed plains of the Libyan desert without  reaching that fabled land of Manu where the sun set every evening; but  looking eastward from the valley, they could see the peak of Bakhu,  which marked the limit of regions accessible to man.    Beyond these regions lay the beginnings of To-nutri, the land of the  gods, and the breezes passing over it were laden with its perfumes, and  sometimes wafted them to mortals lost in the desert.[*]         * The  perfumes  and the  odoriferous woods of the Divine       Land were celebrated in Egypt. A traveller or hunter,       crossing the desert, \"could not but be vividly impressed by       suddenly becoming aware, in the very midst of the desert, of       the penetrating scent of the _robul (Puliciaria undulata_,       Schwbine.), which once followed us throughout a day and two       nights, in some places without our being able to distinguish       whence it came; as, for instance, when we were crossing       tracts of country without any traces of vegetation whatever.\"       (Golenischeff).    Northward, the world came to an end towards the lagoons of the Delta,  whose inaccessible islands were believed to be the sojourning-place  of souls after death. As regards the south, precise knowledge of it  scarcely went beyond the defiles of Gebel Sil-sileh, where the last  remains of the granite threshold had perhaps not altogether disappeared.  The district beyond Gebel Silsileh, the province of Konusit, was still  a foreign and almost mythic country, directly connected with heaven by  means of the cataract. Long after the Egyptians had broken through this  restricted circle, the names of those places which had as it were marked  out their frontiers, continued to be associated in their minds with the  idea of the four cardinal points. Bakhu and Manu were still the most  frequent expressions for the extreme East and West. Nekhabit and Buto,  the most populous towns in the neighbourhoods of Gebel Silsileh and the  ponds of the Delta, were set over against each other to designate South  and North. It was within these narrow limits that Egyptian civilization  struck root and ripened, as in a closed vessel. What were the people by  whom it was developed, the country whence they came, the races to  which they belonged, is to-day unknown. The majority would place their  cradle-land in Asia,[*] but cannot agree in determining the route which  was followed in the emigration to Africa.         * The greater number of contemporary Egyptologists, Brugsch,       Ebers,--Lauth, Lieblein, have rallied to this opinion, in       the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19406"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XXXVI., No. 8, February 24, 1877 (#11)"],[1," years,      reaching back to the enactment of the first patent law. The      needs of the Office have advanced in proportion to this sudden      and vast increase of work, but have been but partly supplied.      Nay, in fact, its already scanty force and accommodations have      been actually reduced at a time when most required. If these      vast interests, and the future promotion of science and the      useful arts are to be encouraged, a liberal recognition must be      made of the wants of this Office.        \"The Examining Corps, the duties in which are most arduous and      exacting, comprises gentlemen of legal, as well as scientific,      attainments. It should be re-inforced by more of the same      character. They should be relieved, by legislation, of continual      embarrassment by reason of meager salaries and fears of removal      incident to merely political changes. The Office would then be      spared the continual loss of its most experienced and efficient      men.\"           *       *       *       *       *          THE IRON TRADE IN ENGLAND.      The British _Mercantile Gazette_ of January 15 states that the  situation and prospects of the iron trade have not materially improved  in the month of December, but some week or two must elapse yet before  trade returns to its regular channels. In the north of England the  tone of the market is tolerably cheerful, and prospects, though still  vague, are considered encouraging. Makers of pig iron go into the next  quarter with a good supply of orders on their books, and merchants and  consumers are desirous of buying over the first half of the year.  Notwithstanding the great depression which has ruled throughout 1876,  there is likely to be a greater production of pig iron by several  thousand tons than ever there was before, and the total make must  considerably exceed two million tons, which is twice the quantity  turned out in Scotland, though in the latter district a greater number  of furnaces have been kept in blast. Prices are nominally the same as  were quoted last week, but show an upward tendency. The bulk of the  mills and forges, foundries, etc., have resumed work, and the finished  iron trade is again in full swing. The plate department is well  provided with orders, but the rail manufacturers, though rather better  off than they were, are still in a poor position. The miscellaneous  branches of the iron trade, such as the foundries and tube, wire, and  cut-nail manufactories are generally well off for orders, and  engineers find plenty to do. The wages agreement in the finished iron  trade ends this week, but it is thought that no alteration will be  made. In the South Staffordshire iron trade, work has been only  partially resumed as yet, and many of the mills and forges will not be  started until the quarterly meetings, next week. Orders have rarely  been so scarce as they are at this moment, arrears having been pretty  generally cleared off before the holidays, and no new ones coming in.  Nevertheless, the feeling of the trade is more hopeful than it was a  month ago. The number of furnaces in blast in this district is now  only 58 out of 153; but should the expected improvement in trade  arrive with the quarterly meeting, this number will soon be increased.  In the finished iron branch, in which quotations for marked iron  contain the basis of $45 for bars, makers of leading brands of sheets  and bars are better off than the manufacturers of cheap iron, who  suffer much from competition in the north. Some considerable contracts  for girders, bridges, gasometers, etc., are under execution at the  works devoted to constructive ironwork; but the merchant iron trade,  as a whole, is very dull. Unmarked iron is weak and variable, and to  this circumstance may be attributed the reduction, announced this  week, in various descriptions of common iron hardware.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED LATHE CHUCK.      The annexed engravings represent a new lathe chuck, which may be  constructed of any size, which holds tools with great firmness, and  which is provided with an improved device for taking up wear and for  the separate adjustment of the jaws. The implement is made of the best  steel, by special machinery, so that its parts are interchangeable.    [Illustration: VINTON'S LATHE CHUCK.]    Figs. 1 and 2 represent the chuck taken apart so as to exhibit the  interior. Figs. 3 and 4 are sectional views. A is a collar which  encircles the spindle, and has formed on its outer face a bevel gear  wheel, B. C, Fig. 3, is the rear portion of the shell of the chuck  inclosing the forward part of the collar, A. Also on said collar, A,  is a washer, D, which rests against the shell, C, and a nut, E, which  travels on a thread formed on the collar. As it is necessary, as will  be explained further on, to turn the entire shell in order to move the  jaws, the use of the nut just described is to jam the part, C, and the  enlarged portion of the collar, A, tightly together, and so rigidly  hold the jaws in any position in which they may be adjusted. Fig. 1  represents the outer face of the chuck with the jaws and their working  mechanism. Within the chuck, each jaw has attached to it a screw, E.  This enters a bevel wheel, F. As the jaws are incapable of any but  radial motion, it follows that, when the chuck is rotated bodily and  the bevel wheels engage on the motionless gear wheel, B, the effect of  the rotation of said bevel wheels is to cause the jaws to travel  toward or from the center of the chuck face. And it will be further  clear that this motion must be simultaneous in all the jaws. As the  outer portion of the chuck is rigidly secured to the shell, C, by  screws, of course when that shell is jammed, as already stated, by the  nut, E, it becomes impossible to turn the chuck bodily; and hence the  bevel wheels cannot be rotated around the main gear wheel, and  consequently the position of the jaws cannot be altered. The above  comprises the mechanism proper of the device, that is to say, all that  is necessary for moving or clamping the jaws.    There is, however, another feature of considerable importance yet to  be described, and that is the device for taking up any play of the  jaws due to wear, and which enables each to be adjusted so that the  motion of all may be uniform. By referring to Fig. 4, it will be seen  that, above the bevel wheel, there is a projection, into the threaded  interior of which, as already explained, the jaw screw enters.  Surrounding this projection is a sleeve, G, the outer surface of which  is threaded to fit a similarly threaded aperture, cut partly in the  shell and partly in the face plate. The upper portion of the sleeve is  notched to receive a wrench or driver; and beneath the sleeve an armed  washer, H, is slipped over the projection. The arms of this washer  enter recesses in the face plate. It will be evident that, by turning  the sleeve, F, so that the screw works inward, the jaw and all its  appendages will be moved bodily in corresponding direction. But its  movement is limited by the arms of the washer, G, which, through the  narrowness of the recesses, are allowed only just enough play to  compensate for slight changes in the jaw. As the above device is  applied to every jaw, it follows that any one of them may be nicely  adjusted from the outside, so that all are caused to grasp the tool  accurately. The spindle, instead of being solid as represented, may be  made hollow. Patented to J.H. Vinton, August 18, 1874. For further  information, address the manufacturer, Mr. F. Armstrong, Bridgeport,  Conn.           *       *       *       *       *          SCREW-CUTTING LATHES.      [Illustration: Screw-Cutting Lathes]    An English lathe, now in use at the Rogers Locomotive Works, Paterson,  N.J., contains several novel features. The ways are flat on the faces,  instead of having raised Vs; and this is a feature of all English  lathes, and of those known in this country as the Freeland lathes. A  great deal of discussion has at various times taken place as to the  relative qualification or merits of these two forms of lathe bed. The  advocates of the flat way, with Vs at the edges of the way, claim  superiority on the score of steadiness, increased wearing surface, and  strength; while, on behalf of the raised Vs, it is urged that, the Vs  being true, the saddle is bound to travel true, because there can be  no lost motion on the slides; whereas any lost motion, from want of  adjustment of the slides in flat ways, is liable to be reproduced  twofold in the work, for the reason that 1/100 of an inch lateral  movement of the slide carriage becomes 1/50 of an inch in the diameter  of the work. Then, again, the most of the wear upon a lathe bed takes  place at the part at and near the running center of the lathe, because  the saddle is, on account of short jobs, more used in that part than  on any other. As a result, when wear has taken place, the saddle, if  adjusted to suit the worn part, becomes too tight to travel over the  unworn part of the bed; and hence, after the wear has taken place, a  proper adjustment of the lathe saddle becomes impossible if the job is  a long one. In the case of raised Vs, however, the wear simply causes  the saddle to fall vertically, so that an amount of wear equal to  1/100 of an inch would have the same effect as lowering the tool 1/100  inch, its effect upon the work being almost imperceptible by ordinary  measurement. On the other hand, however, V lathes are usually made  with either a weight or a spring to keep the saddle down; and as a  result, when the cutting tool stands far out from the tool post, the  saddle is apt to tip, especially in the case of boring with a lathe  tool. In some cases, the raised Vs are accompanied with gibs to secure  the saddle; but in many instances the gibs are given too little  wearing surface. In"]]]
