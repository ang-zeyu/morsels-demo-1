The two men looked at one another.    \"No,\" breathed one.    \"Especially as they could get clean away if they were clever,\" said  Jean, \"and it isn't likely that they would leave her in a condition to  betray them, is it?\"    Mr. Hoggins cleared his throat.    \"It's not very likely, miss,\" he said.    Jean shrugged her shoulders.    \"Women do these things, and then they blame the poor man to whom a  thousand pounds would be a fortune because he comes and takes it.  Personally, I should not like to live at 84, Cavendish Mansions.\"    \"84, Cavendish Mansions,\" murmured Mr. Hoggins absent-mindedly.    His last sentence had been one of ten years' penal servitude. His next  sentence would be for life. Nobody knew this better than Jean  Briggerland as she went on to talk of the club and of the wonderful work  which it was doing.    She dismissed her visitors and went back to her sitting-room. As she  turned to go up the stairway her maid intercepted her.    \"Mary is in your room, miss,\" she said in a low voice.    Jean frowned but made no reply.    The woman who stood awkwardly in the centre of the room awaiting the  girl, greeted her with an apologetic smile.    \"I'm sorry, miss,\" she said, \"but I lost my job this morning. That old  man spotted me. He's a split--a detective.\"    Jean Briggerland regarded her with an unmoved face save that her  beautiful mouth took on the pathetic little droop which had excited the  pity of a judge and an army of lawyers.    \"When did this happen?\" she asked.    \"Last night, miss. He came and I got a bit cheeky to him, and he turned  on me, the old devil, and told me my real name and that I'd got the job  by forging recommendations.\"    Jean sat down slowly in the padded Venetian chair before her writing  table.    \"Jaggs?\" she asked.    \"Yes, miss.\"    \"And why didn't you come here at once?\"    \"I thought I might be followed, miss.\"    The girl bit her lip and nodded.    \"You did quite right,\" she said, and then after a moment's reflection,  \"We shall be in Paris next week. You had better go by the night train  and wait for us at the flat.\"    She gave the maid some money and after she had gone, sat for an hour  before the fire looking into its red depths.    She rose at last a little stiffly, pulled the heavy silken curtain  across the windows and switched on the light, and there was a smile on  her face that was very beautiful to see. For in that hour came an  inspiration.    She sought her father in his study and told him her plan, and he  blanched and shivered with the very horror of it.          Chapter XII      Mr. Briggerland, it seemed, had some other object in life than the  regeneration of the criminal classes. He was a sociologist--a loose  title which covers a great deal of inquisitive investigation into other  people's affairs. Moreover, he had published a book on the subject. His  name was on the title page and the book had been reviewed to his credit;  though in truth he did no more than suggest the title, the work in  question having been carried out by a writer on the subject who, for a  consideration, had allowed Mr. Briggerland to adopt the child of his  brain.    On a morning when pale yellow sunlight brightened his dining-room, Mr.  Briggerland put down his newspaper and looked across the table at his  daughter. He had a club in the East End of London and his manager had  telephoned that morning sending a somewhat unhappy report.    \"Do you remember that man Talmot, my dear?\" he asked.    She nodded, and looked up quickly.    \"Yes, what about him?\"    \"He's in hospital,\" said Mr. Briggerland. \"I fear that he and Hoggins  were engaged in some nefarious plan and that in making an attempt to  enter--as, of course, they had no right to enter--a block of flats in  Cavendish Place, poor Talmot slipped and fell from the fourth floor  window-sill, breaking his leg. Hoggins had to carry him to hospital.\"    The girl reached for bacon from the hot plate.    \"He should have broken his neck,\" she said calmly. \"I suppose now the  police are making tender inquiries?\"    \"No, no,\" Mr. Briggerland hastened to assure her. \"Nobody knows anything  about it, not even the--er--fortunate occupant of the flat they were  evidently trying to burgle. I only learnt of it because the manager of  the club, who gets information of this character, thought I would be  interested.\"    \"Anyway I'm glad they didn't succeed,\" said Jean after a while. \"The  possibility of their trying rather worried me. The Hoggins type is such  a bungler that it was almost certain they would fail.\"    It was a curious fact that whilst her father made the most guarded  references to all their exploits and clothed them with garments of  euphemism, his daughter never attempted any such disguise. The  psychologist would find in Mr. Briggerland's reticence the embryo of a  once dominant rectitude, no trace of which remained in his daughter's  moral equipment.    \"I have been trying to place this man Jaggs,\" she went on with a little  puzzled frown, \"and he completely baffles me. He arrives every night in  a taxicab, sometimes from St. Pancras, sometimes from Euston, sometimes  from London Bridge Station.\"    \"Do you think he is a detective?\"    \"I don't know,\" she said thoughtfully. \"If he is, he has been imported  from the provinces. He is not a Scotland Yard man. He may, of course, be  an old police pensioner, and I have been trying to trace him from that  source.\"    \"It should not be difficult to find out all about him,\" said Mr.  Briggerland easily. \"A man with his afflictions should be pretty  well-known.\"    He looked at his watch.    \"My appointment at Norwood is at eleven o'clock,\" he said. He made a  little grimace of disgust.    \"Would you rather I went?\" asked the girl.    Mr. Briggerland would much rather that she had undertaken the  disagreeable experience which lay before him, but he dare not confess as  much.    \"You, my dear? Of course not! I would not allow you to have such an  experience. No, no, I don't mind it a bit.\"    Nevertheless, he tossed down two long glasses of brandy before he left.    His car set him down before the iron gates of a squat and ugly stucco  building, surrounded by high walls, and the uniformed attendant, having  examined his credentials, admitted him. He had to wait a little while  before a second attendant arrived to conduct him to the medical  superintendent, an elderly man who did not seem overwhelmed with joy at  the honour Mr. Briggerland was paying him.    \"I'm sorry I shan't be able to show you round, Mr. Briggerland,\" he  said. \"I have an engagement in town, but my assistant, Dr. Carew, will  conduct you over the asylum and give you all the information you  require. This, of course, as you know, is a private institution. I  should have thought you would have got more material for your book in  one of the big public asylums. The people who are sent to Norwood, you  know, are not the mild cases, and you will see some rather terrible  sights. You are prepared for that?\"    Mr. Briggerland nodded. He was prepared to the extent of two full  noggins of brandy. Moreover, he was well aware that Norwood was the  asylum to which the more dangerous of lunatics were transferred.    Dr. Carew proved to be a young and enthusiastic alienist whose heart and  soul was in his work.    \"I suppose you are prepared to see jumpy things,\" he said with a smile,  as he conducted Mr. Briggerland along a stone-vaulted corridor.    He opened a steel gate, the bars of which were encased with thick layers  of rubber, crossed a grassy plot (there were no stone-flagged paths at  Norwood) and entered one of the three buildings which constituted the  asylum proper.    It was a harrowing, heart-breaking, and to some extent, a disappointing  experience for Mr. Briggerland. True, his heart did not break, because  it was made of infrangible material, and his disappointment was  counter-balanced by a certain vague relief.    At the end of two hours' inspection they were standing out on the big  playing fields, watching the less violent of the patients wandering  aimlessly about. Except one, they were unattended by keepers, but in the  case of this one man, two stalwart uniformed men walked on either side  of him.    \"Who is he?\" asked Briggerland.    \"That is rather a sad case,\" said the alienist cheerfully. He had  pointed out many \"sad cases\" in the same bright manner. \"He's a doctor  and a genuine homicide. Luckily they detected him before he did any  mischief or he would have been in Broadmoor.\"    \"Aren't you ever afraid of these men escaping?\" asked Mr. Briggerland.    \"You asked that before,\" said the doctor in surprise. \"No. You see, an  insane asylum is not like a prison; to make a good get-away from prison  you have to have outside assistance. Nobody wants to help a lunatic  escape, otherwise it would be easier than getting out of prison, because  we have no patrols in the grounds, the wards can be opened from the  outside without a key and the night patrol who visits the wards every  half-hour has no time for any other observation. Would you like to talk  to Dr. Thun?\"    Mr. Briggerland hesitated only for a second.    \"Yes,\" he said huskily.    There was nothing in the appearance of the patient to suggest that he  was in any way dangerous. A fair, bearded man, with pale blue eyes, he  held out his hand impulsively to the visitor, and after a momentary  hesitation, Mr. Briggerland took it and found his hand in a grip like a  vice. The two attendants exchanged glances with the asylum doctor and  strolled off.    \"I think you can talk to him without fear,\" said the doctor in a low  voice, not so low, however, that the patient did not hear it, for he  laughed.    \"Without fear, favour or prejudice, eh? Yes, that was how they swore the  officers at my court martial."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21531"],[0,"Woodwork Joints: How They Are Set Out, How Made and Where Used. (#11)"],[1,"also being given. Here we have another type of irregular  setting out, which is accomplished in the following manner. Saw and plane  the broken portion of the leg true as shown; take the timber which is to  be jointed and treat it in a similar manner; now place four ordinary pins  on the lower portion. Carefully place the top portion to the required  position and smartly give it one tap with the hammer; this will cause the  pin-heads to leave indentations, and if these be taken as centres for  boring, accurate work will result. The new portion of the leg is  afterwards sawn and wrought to the desired shape.    This is an example of work where it is next to impossible to use a  gauge, and as only one joint is required it is not worth the time taken  to make a template.    [Illustration: Fig. 208.--Dowelling a Dining-Table Leg.]    [Illustration: Fig. 209.--Dowel Gauge for Legs.]    [Illustration: Fig. 210.--Dowelling a Cabriole Leg.]    The tools used in dowelling are: Brace, countersink, dowel-rounder, twist  bit, try-square, marking-awl, and the usual bench tools. The first four  are illustrated at Figs. 194, 195, 196 and 197 respectively.    The method of working is: Plane up, mark out, bore holes, countersink,  glue dowels and complete joints.          THE SCARF JOINT      The method known as \"scarfing\" is used for the joining of timber in the  direction of its length, enabling the workman to produce a joint with a  smooth or flush appearance on all its faces. One of the simplest forms of  scarfed joint is known as the half lap, in which a portion is cut out at  the end of each beam or joist, equal in depth to half the full depth of  the beam, and of equal length to the required scarf.    The two pieces before they are placed together form a joint as shown at  Fig. 211, the projecting part (A) fitting into the recessed portion  marked B and the two pieces being secured in their respective positions  by screws.    Fig. 212 shows a dovetailed scarf joint. This is a variation of Fig. 211,  the length of the dovetail lap being from 6 ins. to 8 ins. in length.    Fig. 213 is an illustration of a joint designed to resist a cross strain.  The face side is left flush, whilst the underside is assisted by an iron  plate. The joint is secured with nuts, bolts, and washers. This type of  joint is frequently used for joining purlins in roof work; the iron plate  on the underside is in this case omitted.    Fig. 214 is designed to resist both tension and compression and is an  excellent joint for all purposes. The joint is brought together by using  folding wedges as shown in the centre.    [Illustration: Fig. 211.--Half-Lap Scarf Joint for Light Timber.]    [Illustration: Fig. 212.--Dovetailed Scarf Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 213.--Plated Scarf Joint Used in Roof Work.]    Fig. 215 is a variation of Fig. 214, and it will be noticed that tenons  are provided on the face and underside to resist cross strain. Probably  this is one of the best varieties of the scarfed joint. Unfortunately,  however, its production is somewhat costly, and this may be the reason  that it is not more universally used. Folding wedges are used to secure  the two pieces in position.    [Illustration: Fig. 214.--Tenoned Scarf Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 215.--Double Tenoned Scarf Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 216.--Scarf Joint with Vee'd ends.]    Fig. 216 is a scarfed joint with undercut vee'd ends which prevent the  joint from lipping up or down or sideways. It is a useful joint, calling  for careful setting out and accurate craftsmanship. Folding wedges are  used in this case to draw up and secure the joint.    Fig. 217 is a \"fished joint,\" and the following difference between a  scarfed and fished joint should be noted. A fished joint need not  necessarily reduce the total length of the beams to be joined, and fish  plates of wood or iron (or a combination of both) are fastened at each  side of the joint. In a scarf joint all surfaces are flush. In Fig. 217  the beams are butt-jointed and secured by wooden plates and iron bolts.  The upper plate is let into each beam, and the lower plate is provided  with two wooden keys to prevent the beams sliding (or \"creeping\") upon  the lower plate. Iron nuts, bolts, and washers are used to complete the  joint.    [Illustration: Fig. 217.--Fished Joint.]    In the case of the scarfed joint at Fig. 218 (used for purlins) the  length of the scarf is usually made about four times that of the depth of  tie beam. It has two hardwood keys which force the pieces together and  thus tighten the joint.    [Illustration: Fig. 218.--Detail of Scarfed Joint in Purlins.]    The methods of scarfing and fish-jointing are many and varied, and, in  selecting a joint, the nature of the pieces to be joined and the  direction and the amount of the load should be carefully taken into  consideration.    The above joints come under the heading of carpentry, and the ordinary  tools such as the saw, plane, boring-bit and chisels are all that are  requisite and necessary to produce a sound and serviceable joint. Scarfed  joints are generally of large size, and they are usually made by placing  the work upon sawing trestles owing to the bench being too small to  accommodate the large timbers.    [Illustration: Fig. 219.--Example of Tabled Joint with Straps.]    [Illustration: Fig. 220.--Lapped Scarf Joint with Bolts for Heavy  Timber.]    Fig. 219 is a tabled scarf joint which admirably resists tension and  compression. It is very easy to make and fit, and is not materially  affected by shrinkage. The rectangular wrought iron straps are knocked up  over the joint after the two pieces engage. The length of the joint  should be approximately five times its thickness.    Fig. 220 is an example of a lapped scarf joint which is secured with nuts  and bolts. It effectively resists compressional stress in vertical posts  and it may, if required, be strengthened by the addition of wrought iron  fish plates. It is quite a serviceable joint for all general purposes,  such as shed or garage building where fairly heavy timbers are used.          THE HINGED JOINT      One of the most common forms of hinged joint in use to-day is that formed  by using the \"butt\" hinge, and many troubles experienced by the amateur,  such as \"hinge-bound,\" \"stop-bound,\" and \"screw-bound\" doors, etc., are  due to a lack of knowledge of the principles of hingeing. Hinges call for  careful gauging and accurate fitting, otherwise trouble is certain to  occur.    A \"BOUND\" door or box lid is said to be hinge-bound when the recess which  contains the hinge is cut too deep. The frame and the body portion engage  too tightly when closed, the result being that the door has always a  tendency to open a little. This fault may be in many cases remedied by  packing behind the hinge with one or two thicknesses of good stiff brown  paper. For packing purposes such as this paper will be found to be of  much more value than thin strips of wood or knife-cut veneer, the latter  always having a great tendency to split when a screw or bradawl is  inserted.    A stop-bound door is the name applied when the door is not finished to  exactly the same thickness as originally intended. This causes the door  to bind on the stops at the back, as shown at Fig. 221. The difficulty  may be remedied by thinning the door a little at the back, or slightly  rounding away the portion which binds.    Screw-bound is a common fault often overlooked by the amateur. It is  caused by using screws of which the heads are too large for the  countersunk holes in the hinge, and may be avoided by slightly sinking  the holes in the brasswork with a countersink or rose-bit.    [Illustration: Fig. 221.--Stop-bound Door.]    [Illustration: Fig. 222.--Butt Hinge.]    [Illustration: Fig. 223.--Gauging.]    [Illustration: Fig. 224.--Marking for Recess.]    [Illustration: Fig. 225.--Sawing for the Recess.]    ALIGNMENT.--Another fault that is fairly common is having the axes of the  hinges out of alignment. Especially is this the case when three hinges  are used to hang a wardrobe or other large door. It is absolutely  necessary in all cases that the exact centres of the pivot-pins of the  hinges should be in a straight line.    Particular attention to alignment is necessary when the body and the door  frame are shaped on the face side. A familiar example that every reader  may inspect for himself is the curved side of a railway carriage body and  railway carriage door, where he will notice that a specially wide hinge  has to be used at the bottom of the door to give the necessary alignment.  Hinges fixed on work with their centres out of truth are often overlooked  by the inexperienced worker, and this is a frequent cause of creaking.    GAUGING.--Fig. 222 is a sketch of a brass butt hinge, open. Fig. 223  illustrates a similar hinge closed, and shows the gauge set so that the  point of the marker is exactly to the centre of the pivot-pin. This  distance we will call C. Now turn to Fig. 224. The distance C has been  gauged from the face side of the frame. The gauge is then set to the  thickness of the hinge at its thickest portion, and to prevent  \"hinge-bind\" see that the gauge is set on the _fine_ side. Remember that  the tapered point of the steel spur or marking awl will part the fibres  of the timber a little more than the fine point, and give you a wider  gauge line than was anticipated when you set the gauge. The inexperienced  worker nearly always overlooks this. The result is a hinge-bound door,  the cause of which is not discovered by the worker because he is so sure  that he has set the gauge correctly. The distance B, Fig. 226, shows the  line gauged for the thickness of the hinge.    POSITION OF HINGES.--Another difficulty to the beginner is the position  for his hinges, and it may here be stated that the general rule is to  carry a line across the face of the work from the inside of the cross"]]]
