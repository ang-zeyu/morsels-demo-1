More probably the hagioscope was intended to be used by  the watcher at the sepulchre.    [Illustration: The Choir, looking West.]    The arrangement of the presbytery, as we have already noted when  referring to the plates here reproduced from Britton, has undergone many  changes; in the beginning of the century the level of the floor of the  choir was continued until between the third and fourth bay from the  tower in the presbytery, where it rose by five steps to the level of the  sanctuary floor. Harrod speaks of two steps up at the third pier past  the tower, and three at the fourth or point of the junction of the apse.  In Dean Goulburn's time, the sanctuary space was enlarged by being  brought forward one bay. The present floor, designed by Sir A.W.  Blomfield in glass mosaic and porphyry, was executed by Powell  Brothers. Then also was added the somewhat elaborate communicants' rail,  executed in bronze and spars. In enlarging the sanctuary, Dean Goulburn  moved the three steps from the fourth pier past the tower to the third,  and at the same time the two steps at the third pier were moved forward  to the first past the tower. And now again, during the recent works of  reparation, the presbytery floor has been brought forward at one level  to the tower arch, where it descends to the level of the choir floor by  five steps: screens which filled the first bays on either side were  removed, and similar flights of steps now descend from the presbytery  and the north and south aisles. The cumbrous stalls were also removed,  and in part refixed in the nave.    The stained glass which fills the clerestory windows of the apse dates  from 1846, and was made by Yarrington. The window in the triforium just  above the altar contains modern stained-glass, dedicated to the memory  of Canon Thurlow.    #Monuments in the Presbytery.#--The monument of Herbert, the first  bishop of Norwich, and the founder of the cathedral, was raised in the  centre of presbytery, before the high altar. It was so much injured  during the time of the Rebellion that a new one was erected in 1682;  this again was levelled, and a slab placed in the floor at the same  place now remains.    In the second bay eastward from the tower (south side), marked 10 on  plan--Bishop Goldwell's (1472-99) chantry, and the altar tomb,  remarkable for the effigy in full pontificals (see illustration). Bloxam  remarks that it is \"the only instance of the monumental effigy of a  bishop, prior to the Reformation, in which the _cappa pluvialis_, or  processional cope, is represented as the outward vestment instead of the  casula or chesible.\" The tomb is placed to the south of the recess; in  the space east was an altar.    In the third bay eastward was Bishop Wakering's (1416-25) tomb, the only  part of which now remaining is visible from the south aisle, and  consists of a series of panels with plain shields and figures two by  two, with the several instruments of the Passion. There were formerly  steps down into the south aisle from this bay. In the same place is a  monument to Bishop Overall (d. 1619).    [Illustration: Detail of the Presbytery Clerestory and Vaulting.]    In the fourth bay (marked 11 on plan) the altar tomb of Sir William  Boleyn of Blickling (d. 1505).    Of the fourth bay eastward from tower on the south side (marked 9 on  plan), Sir Thomas Browne says: \"On the north of the choir--_the  presbytery is meant_--between the two arches, next to Queen  Elizabeth's seat, were buried Sir Thomas Erpingham and his wives, the  Lady Joan, etc., whose pictures were in the painted glass windows next  to this place, with the arms of the Erpinghams. The insides of both the  pillars were painted in red colours, with divers figures and  inscriptions from the top almost to the bottom, which are now washed out  by the late whiting of the pillars.... There was a long brass  inscription about the tombstone, which was torn away in the late times,  the name of Erpingham only remaining.\"    During the recent works, under this same spot was found a leaden coffin  enclosing human bones, which were possibly the remains of Sir Thomas  Erpingham.    An amusing tale is told by Harrod of Roger Bigod's burial in the  cathedral. He was the founder of Thetford Priory, and died in 1107,  leaving directions that his body should be buried in his own monastery.  The prior of Thetford was much perplexed to hear that Bishop Herbert had  taken possession of the body, and had determined that it should be  interred with all the due solemnities at Norwich. Herbert was anxious to  secure for his own foundation so valuable a source of income as the  offerings and celebrations at the tomb of a pious man like Bigod; and no  doubt the prior was not actuated alone by love for his departed abbot.  The bishop won, and Roger Bigod was buried in the cathedral, possibly in  the same crypt which is supposed to contain the bones of Herbert  himself.    #The North Transept#, like the south, is without aisles or triforium,  the wall space up to the clerestory level being decorated with wall  arcading, varying considerably in position and detail in each  compartment. The clerestory follows round from the nave, and overhead is  the later lierne vault. It was, together with the eastern arm of the  cathedral, closed for two and a half years, during which period the  whole of the lime-white and paint encrusting the stonework was flaked  off. The work, so far as we can understand, was really a restoration,  inasmuch as the original stonework was restored to view. The level of  the floor was made to correspond with that of the choir, and a raised  wooden floor with the benches thereon removed. The transepts were built  by Herbert, the first bishop and founder. Both originally had an apsidal  chapel on the eastern wall, but only that on the north arm remains,  and access to this now is not possible from the transept. Dedicated at  one time to St. Anne, it is now used as a store-house.    [Illustration: The Choir Apse.]    The vault was added by Bishop Nykke, and was necessitated by a fire in  1509, which consumed the wooden roofs of both transepts. During the  recent works the small arcading immediately under the line of the vault  was discovered walled up, the builders of the later vault in all  probability having done this, as in many cases the line of the vault  cuts over the arcading. This was opened up, and is distinctively  interesting in helping to reconstruct the original finish to the Norman  work under the roof.    #The Tower and Triforium Walks#, to which access is gained by a  staircase in the east wall of north transept, are of much interest. In  the triforium the imposition of the later work on the Norman is clearly  noticeable, and the original Norman triple windows walled up with the  wall shafts which once supported the semi-arches of the triforium roof.  Some of the best views of the interior are to be gained from the  triforium and clerestory paths.    #Interior of Tower.#--A continuation of the same staircase leads to the  clerestory, and from thence access is gained to the tower galleries.  Above the arches of the crossing there is a vaulted passage in the  thickness of the tower walls, with six arches pierced in the inner wall,  so that the parts of the interior can be seen from this walk. Above  occurs a smaller wall arcade, stopped before reaching the angle to admit  of large circular holes being deeply recessed in the walls; and above  this again another vaulted gallery, with three windows on either side,  pierced through the tower. In the lower of these walks openings occur  through the thickness of the walls into the presbytery, the nave, and  transepts, just under the vaults, and interestingly quaint peeps can be  gained through them.    The #Processional Path#, or aisles to the presbytery, consists of four  bays to the north and south, with quadri-partite vaulting, with a  similar five following round the line of the apse. A door in the north  aisle leads out into the gardens of the bishop's palace, and from thence  the exterior of this part of the cathedral is best seen.    Crossing the north aisle to the presbytery, at the fourth bay eastward  past the tower, marked F on plan, there occurs a curious bridge chapel  spanning the aisle, access thereto being gained by a newel staircase on  the north side. In our notes on the Presbytery, we have referred to the  uses assigned to this structure and its connection with the Easter  sepulchre. It formed the ante-chapel to the reliquary chapel projecting  northward from the outer wall of the cathedral; it probably was built as  a bridge so that relics and symbols might be exhibited thereon to  processions passing along underneath. It is decorated in character, and  the vault is constructed of chalk. The chapel above is decorated with  frescoes, the subjects of which are as follow:--In the western quarter  of the four-part vault, The Blessed Virgin between SS. Margaret and  Catherine; in the eastern, SS. Andrew, Peter, and Paul; in the northern,  SS. Martin, Nicholas, Richard; in the southern, SS. Edmund, Lawrence,  and a bishop; a figure of Christ occurs centrally. Copies of these  frescoes have been made in facsimile, and hang in the aisle and  consistory court. Passing through the small door in the north wall of  the north aisle before mentioned to the outside, the lines of the  reliquary chapel can be plainly seen, and also of another to the west;  the position of both these chapels is shown by dotted lines on the plan.    [Illustration: Detail of the Clerestory, North Transept.]    A coped coffin lid of Purbeck marble, now in the aisle of presbytery,  should be noticed; an inscribed brass once occupied the bevelled edge.

Also, while _tial_ is most common by far, we have _cial,_  as in _special, official,_ etc.    Special words with c sounded like s.    We have already given a list of simple words in which _c_ is used for  _s,_ but the following may be singled out because they are troublesome:    acquiesce  paucity  reticence  vacillate  coincidence=  publicity  license  tenacity  crescent  prejudice=  scenery  condescend  effervesce  proboscis  scintillate=  oscillate  rescind  transcend    Words with obscure Vowels.

Prophecy_ is the noun, _prophesy_ the verb,  distinguished in pronunciation by the fact that the final _y_ in the verb  is long, in the noun it is short.  The following are a few words in _sy_  which deserve notice:    controversy  ecstasy=  embassy  heresy=  hypocrisy  courtesy=  fantasy  ________    The above lists are for reference and for review.  No one, in school or  out, should attempt to memorize these words offhand.  The only rational way  to learn them is by reference to the dictionary when one has occasion to  write them, and to observe them in reading.  These two habits, the use of  the dictionary and observing the formation of words in reading, will prove  more effective in the mastery of words of this character than three times  the work applied in any other way.  The usual result of the effort to  memorize in lists is confusion so instilled that it can never be  eradicated.    By way of review it is often well to look over such lists as those  above, and common words which one is likely to use and which one feels  one ought to have mastered, may be checked with a pencil, and the  attention concentrated upon them for a few minutes.  It will be well also  to compare such words as _stupefy_ and _stupidity, rarity_ and _rarefy_.      Homonyms.    The infatuation of modern spelling-book makers has introduced the  present generation to a serious difficulty in spelling which was not  accounted great in olden times.  The pupil now has forced upon him a  large number of groups of words pronounced alike but spelled differently.    The peculiar trouble with these words is due to the confusion between  the two forms, and to increase this the writers of spelling-books have  insisted on placing the two forms side by side in black type or italic  so that the pupil may forever see those two forms dancing together before  his eyes whenever he has occasion to use one of them.  The attempt is  made to distinguish them by definitions or use in sentences; but as the  mind is not governed by logical distinctions so much as by association,  the pupil is taught to associate each word with the word which may cause  him trouble, not especially with the meaning to which the word ought to  be so wedded that there can be no doubt or separation.    These words should no doubt receive careful attention; but the  association of one with the other should never be suggested to the  pupil:  it is time enough to distinguish the two when the pupil has  actually confused them.  The effort should always be made to fix in the  pupil's mind from the beginning an association of each word with that  which will be a safe key at all times.  Thus _hear_ may be associated  (should always be associated) with _ear, their_ (_theyr_) with _they,  here_ and _there_ with each other and with _where,_ etc.  It will also  be found that in most cases one word is more familiar than the other,  as for instances _been_ and _bin_.  We learn _been_ and never would  think of confusing it with _bin_ were we not actually taught to do so.  In such cases it is best to see that the common word is quite familiar;  then the less common word may be introduced, and nine chances out of ten  the pupil will not dream of confusion.  In a few cases in which both  words are not very often used, and are equally common or uncommon,  as for instance _mantle_ and _mantel,_ distinction may prove useful as  a method of teaching, but generally it will be found best to drill upon  one of the words, finding some helpful association for it, until it is  thoroughly mastered; then the pupil will know that the other word is  spelled in the other way, and think no more about it.    The following quotations contain words which need special drill.  This is best secured by writing ten or twenty sentences containing each  word, an effort being made to use the word in as many different ways and  connections as possible.  Thus we may make sentences containing _there,_  as follows:    There, where his kind and gentle face looks down upon me,  I used to stand and gaze upon the marble form of Lincoln.    Here and there we found a good picture.    There was an awful crowd.    I stopped there a few moments.    Etc., etc.      Quotations.
