Strengthened and invigorated, the man pursued his journey towards the  old spot. He soon stood upon the banks of his beloved river. A few  more suns and he would sit down upon the very spot where for so many  seasons he had crawled on the slimy leaf, so often dragged himself  lazily over the muddy pool. He had seated himself upon the bank of the  river, and was meditating deeply on these things, when up crept from  the water a beaver, who, addressing him, said in an angry tone--    \"Who are you?\"    \"I am a snail,\" replied the Snail-Man. \"Who are you?\"    \"I am head warrior of the nation of beavers,\" answered the other. \"By  what authority have you come to disturb my possession of this river,  which is my dominion?\"    \"It is not your river,\" replied the Wasbasha. \"The Great Being, who is  over man and beast, has given it to me.\"    The beaver was at first incredulous; but at length, convinced that  what the man said was true, he invited him to accompany him to his  home. The man agreed, and went with him till they came to a number of  small cabins, into the largest of which the beaver conducted him. He  invited the man to take food with him, and while the beaver's wife and  daughter were preparing the feast, he entertained his guest with an  account of his people's habits of life. Soon the wife and daughter  made their appearance with the food, and sitting down the Snail-Man  was soon at his ease amongst them. He was not, however, so occupied  with the banquet that he had not time to be enchanted with the beauty  of the beaver's daughter; and when the visit was drawing to a close,  so much was he in love, that he asked the beaver to give her to him  for his wife. The beaver-chief consented, and the marriage was  celebrated by a feast, to which all the beavers, and the animals with  whom they had friendly relations, were invited. From this union of the  Snail-Man and the Beaver-Maid sprang the tribe of the Osages,--at  least so it is related by the old men of the tribe.          THE STRANGE GUESTS.      Many years ago there lived, near the borders of Lake Superior, a noted  hunter, who had a wife and one child. His lodge stood in a remote part  of the forest, several days' journey from that of any other person. He  spent his days in hunting, and his evenings in relating to his wife  the incidents that had befallen him in the chase. As game was very  abundant, he seldom failed to bring home in the evening an ample store  of meat to last them until the succeeding evening; and while they were  seated by the fire in his lodge partaking the fruits of his day's  labour, he entertained his wife with conversation, or by occasionally  relating those tales, or enforcing those precepts, which every good  Indian esteems necessary for the instruction of his wife and children.  Thus, far removed from all sources of disquiet, surrounded by all they  deemed necessary to their comfort, and happy in one another's society,  their lives passed away in cheerful solitude and sweet contentment.  The breast of the hunter had never felt the compunctions of remorse,  for he was a just man in all his dealings. He had never violated the  laws of his tribe by encroaching upon the hunting-grounds of his  neighbours, by taking that which did not belong to him, or by any act  calculated to displease the village chiefs or offend the Great Spirit.  His chief ambition was to support his family with a sufficiency of  food and skins by his own unaided exertions, and to share their  happiness around his cheerful fire at night. The white man had not yet  taught them that blankets and clothes were necessary to their comfort,  or that guns could be used in the killing of game.    The life of the Chippewa hunter peacefully glided away.    One evening during the winter season, it chanced that he remained out  later than usual, and his wife sat lonely in the lodge, and began to  be agitated with fears lest some accident had befallen him. Darkness  had already fallen. She listened attentively to hear the sound of  coming footsteps; but nothing could be heard but the wind mournfully  whistling around the sides of the lodge. Time passed away while she  remained in this state of suspense, every moment augmenting her fears  and adding to her disappointment.    Suddenly she heard the sound of approaching footsteps upon the frozen  surface of the snow. Not doubting that it was her husband, she quickly  unfastened the loop which held, by an inner fastening, the skin door  of the lodge, and throwing it open she saw two strange women standing  before it. Courtesy left the hunter's wife no time for deliberation.  She invited the strangers to enter and warm themselves, thinking, from  the distance to the nearest neighbours, they must have walked a  considerable way. When they were entered she invited them to remain.  They seemed to be total strangers to that part of the country, and the  more closely she observed them the more curious the hunter's wife  became respecting her guests.    No efforts could induce them to come near the fire. They took their  seats in a remote part of the lodge, and drew their garments about  them in such a manner as to almost completely hide their faces. They  seemed shy and reserved, and when a glimpse could be had of their  faces they appeared pale, even of a deathly hue. Their eyes were  bright but sunken: their cheek-bones were prominent, and their persons  slender and emaciated.    Seeing that her guests avoided conversation as well as observation,  the woman forbore to question them, and sat in silence until her  husband entered. He had been led further than usual in the pursuit of  game, but had returned with the carcass of a large and fat deer. The  moment he entered the lodge, the mysterious women exclaimed--    \"Behold! what a fine and fat animal!\" and they immediately ran and  pulled off pieces of the whitest fat, which they ate with avidity.    Such conduct appeared very strange to the hunter, but supposing the  strangers had been a long time without food, he made no remark; and  his wife, taking example from her husband, likewise restrained  herself.    On the following evening the same scene was repeated. The hunter  brought home the best portions of the game he had killed, and while he  was laying it down before his wife, according to custom, the two  strange women came quickly up, tore off large pieces of fat, and ate  them with greediness. Such behaviour might well have aroused the  hunter's displeasure; but the deference due to strange guests induced  him to pass it over in silence.    Observing the parts to which the strangers were most partial, the  hunter resolved the next day to anticipate their wants by cutting off  and tying up a portion of the fat for each. This he did: and having  placed the two portions of fat upon the top of his burden, as soon as  he entered the lodge he gave to each stranger the part that was hers.  Still the guests appeared to be dissatisfied, and took more from the  carcass lying before the wife.    Except for this remarkable behaviour, the conduct of the guests was  unexceptionable, although marked by some peculiarities. They were  quiet, modest, and discreet. They maintained a cautious silence during  the day, neither uttering a word nor moving from the lodge. At night  they would get up, and, taking those implements which were then used  in breaking and preparing wood, repair to the forest. Here they would  busy themselves in seeking dry branches and pieces of trees blown down  by the wind. When a sufficient quantity had been gathered to last  until the succeeding night they carried it home upon their shoulders.  Then carefully putting everything in its place within the lodge, they  resumed their seats and their studied silence. They were always  careful to return from their labours before the dawn of day, and were  never known to stay out beyond that hour. In this manner they repaid,  in some measure, the kindness of the hunter, and relieved his wife  from one of her most laborious duties.    Thus nearly the whole year passed away, every day leading to some new  development of character which served to endear the parties to each  other. The visitors began to assume a more hale and healthy aspect;  their faces daily lost something of that deathly hue which had at  first marked them, and they visibly improved in strength, and threw  off some of that cold reserve and forbidding austerity which had kept  the hunter so long in ignorance of their true character.    One evening the hunter returned very late after having spent the day  in toilsome exertion, and having laid the produce of his hunt at his  wife's feet, the silent women seized it and began to tear off the fat  in such an unceremonious manner that the wife could no longer control  her feelings of disgust, and said to herself--    \"This is really too bad. How can I bear it any longer!\"    She did not, however, put her thought into words, but an immediate  change was observed in the two visitors. They became unusually  reserved, and showed evident signs of being uneasy in their situation.  The good hunter immediately perceived this change, and, fearful that  they had taken offence, as soon as they had retired demanded of his  wife whether any harsh expression had escaped her lips during the day.  She replied that she had uttered nothing to give the least offence.  The hunter tried to compose himself to sleep, but he felt restive and  uneasy, for he could hear the sighs and lamentations of the two  strangers. Every moment added to his conviction that his guests had  taken some deep offence; and, as he could not banish this idea from  his mind, he arose, and, going to the strangers, thus addressed them--    \"Tell me, ye women, what is it that causes you pain of mind, and"]]]
