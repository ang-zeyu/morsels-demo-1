How shall we  attain the reality of knowledge? By the breaths and promptings of the Holy  Spirit which is light and knowledge itself. Through it the human mind is  quickened and fortified into true conclusions and perfect knowledge. This  is conclusive argument showing that all available human criterions are  erroneous and defective, but the divine standard of knowledge is  infallible. Therefore man is not justified in saying \"I know because I  perceive through my senses\"; or \"I know because it is proved through my  faculty of reason\"; or \"I know because it is according to tradition and  interpretation of the holy book\"; or \"I know because I am inspired.\" All  human standard of judgment is faulty, finite.            MAN AND NATURE      If we look with a perceiving eye upon the world of creation, we find that  all existing things may be classified as follows: First--Mineral--that is to  say matter or substance appearing in various forms of composition.  Second--Vegetable--possessing the virtues of the mineral plus the power of  augmentation or growth, indicating a degree higher and more specialized  than the mineral. Third--Animal--possessing the attributes of the mineral  and vegetable plus the power of sense perception. Fourth--Human--the highest  specialized organism of visible creation, embodying the qualities of the  mineral, vegetable and animal plus an ideal endowment absolutely minus and  absent in the lower kingdoms--the power of intellectual investigation into  the mysteries of outer phenomena. The outcome of this intellectual  endowment is science which is especially characteristic of man. This  scientific power investigates and apprehends created objects and the laws  surrounding them. It is the discoverer of the hidden and mysterious  secrets of the material universe and is peculiar to man alone. The most  noble and praiseworthy accomplishment of man therefore is scientific  knowledge and attainment.    Science may be likened to a mirror wherein the images of the mysteries of  outer phenomena are reflected. It brings forth and exhibits to us in the  arena of knowledge all the product of the past. It links together past and  present. The philosophical conclusions of bygone centuries, the teachings  of the prophets and wisdom of former sages are crystallized and reproduced  in the scientific advancement of today. Science is the discoverer of the  past. From its premises of past and present we deduce conclusions as to  the future. Science is the governor of nature and its mysteries, the one  agency by which man explores the institutions of material creation. All  created things are captives of nature and subject to its laws. They cannot  transgress the control of these laws in one detail or particular. The  infinite starry worlds and heavenly bodies are nature's obedient subjects.  The earth and its myriad organisms, all minerals, plants and animals are  thralls of its dominion. But man through the exercise of his scientific,  intellectual power can rise out of this condition, can modify, change and  control nature according to his own wishes and uses. Science, so to speak,  is the \"breaker\" of the laws of nature.    Consider, for example, that man according to natural law should dwell upon  the surface of the earth. By overcoming this law and restriction however  he sails in ships over the ocean, mounts to the zenith in aeroplanes and  sinks to the depths of the sea in submarines. This is against the fiat of  nature and a violation of her sovereignty and dominion. Nature's laws and  methods, the hidden secrets and mysteries of the universe, human  inventions and discoveries, all our scientific acquisitions should  naturally remain concealed and unknown, but man through his intellectual  acumen searches them out of the plane of the invisible, draws them into  the plane of the visible, exposes and explains them. For instance, one of  the mysteries of nature is electricity. According to nature this force,  this energy should remain latent and hidden, but man scientifically breaks  through the very laws of nature, arrests it and even imprisons it for his  use.    In brief, man through the possession of this ideal endowment of scientific  investigation is the most noble product of creation, the governor of  nature. He takes the sword from nature's hand and uses it upon nature's  head. According to natural law, night is a period of darkness and  obscurity, but man by utilizing the power of electricity, by wielding this  electric sword overcomes the darkness and dispels the gloom. Man is  superior to nature and makes nature do his bidding. Man is a sensitive  being; nature is minus sensation. Man has memory and reason; nature lacks  them. Man is nobler than nature. There are powers within him of which  nature is devoid. It may be claimed that these powers are from nature  itself and that man is a part of nature. In answer to this statement we  will say that if nature is the whole and man is a part of that whole, how  could it be possible for a part to possess qualities and virtues which are  absent in the whole. Undoubtedly the part must be endowed with the same  qualities and properties as the whole. For example, the hair is a part of  the human anatomy. It cannot contain elements which are not found in other  parts of the body, for in all cases the component elements of the body are  the same. Therefore it is manifest and evident that man, although in body  a part of nature, nevertheless in spirit possesses a power transcending  nature; for if he were simply a part of nature and limited to material  laws he could possess only the things which nature embodies. God has  conferred upon and added to man a distinctive power, the faculty of  intellectual investigation into the secrets of creation, the acquisition  of higher knowledge, the greatest virtue of which is scientific  enlightenment.    This endowment is the most praiseworthy power of man, for through its  employment and exercise, the betterment of the human race is accomplished,  the development of the virtues of mankind is made possible and the spirit  and mysteries of God become manifest.    As material and physical sciences are taught here(8) and are constantly  unfolding in wider vistas of attainment, I am hopeful that spiritual  development may also follow and keep pace with these outer advantages. As  material knowledge is illuminating those within the walls of this great  temple of learning, so also may the light of the spirit, the inner and  divine light of the real philosophy glorify this institution. The most  important principle of divine philosophy is the oneness of the world of  humanity, the unity of mankind, the bond conjoining East and West, the tie  of love which blends human hearts.    Therefore it is our duty to put forth our greatest efforts and summon all  our energies in order that the bonds of unity and accord may be  established among mankind. For thousands of years we have had bloodshed  and strife. It is enough; it is sufficient. Now is the time to associate  together in love and harmony. For thousands of years we have tried the  sword and warfare; let mankind for a time at least live in peace. Review  history and consider how much savagery, how much bloodshed and battle the  world has witnessed. It has been either religious warfare, political  warfare or some other clash of human interests. The world of humanity has  never enjoyed the blessing of Universal Peace. Year by year the implements  of warfare have been increased and perfected. Consider the wars of past  centuries; only ten, fifteen or twenty thousand at the most were killed  but now it is possible to kill one hundred thousand in a single day. In  ancient times warfare was carried on with the sword; today it is the  smokeless gun. Formerly battleships were sailing vessels; today they are  dreadnoughts. Consider the increase and improvement in the weapons of war.  God has created us all human and all countries of the world are parts of  the same globe. We are all his servants. He is kind and just to all. Why  should we be unkind and unjust to each other? He provides for all. Why  should we deprive one another? He protects and preserves all. Why should  we kill our fellow-creatures? If this warfare and strife be for the sake  of religion, it is evident that it violates the spirit and basis of all  religion. All the divine Manifestations have proclaimed the oneness of God  and the unity of mankind. They have taught that men should love and  mutually help each other in order that they might progress. Now if this  conception of religion be true, its essential principle is the oneness of  humanity. The fundamental truth of the Manifestations is peace. This  underlies all religion, all justice. The divine purpose is that men should  live in unity, concord and agreement and should love one another. Consider  the virtues of the human world and realize that the oneness of humanity is  the primary foundation of them all. Read the gospel and the other holy  books. You will find their fundamentals are one and the same.            THE MICROCOSM AND THE MACROCOSM      When we ponder over the reality of the microcosm, we discover that in the  microcosm there are deposited three realities. Man is endowed with an  outer or physical reality. It belongs to the material realm, the animal  kingdom, because it has sprung from the material world. This animalistic  reality of man he shares in common with the animals.    The human body is like animals subject to nature's laws. But man is  endowed with a second reality, the rational or intellectual reality; and  the intellectual reality of man predominates over nature.    All these sciences which we enjoy were the hidden and recondite secrets of  nature, unknowable to nature, but man was enabled to discover these  mysteries, and out "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#11)"],[1,"love of God. But again the cycle begins  and a new springtime appears. In it the former springtime has returned,  the world is resuscitated, illumined and attains spirituality; religion is  renewed and reorganized, hearts are turned to God, the summons of God is  heard and life is again bestowed upon man. For a long time the religious  world had been weakened and materialism had advanced; the spiritual forces  of life were waning, moralities were becoming degraded, composure and  peace had vanished from souls and satanic qualities were dominating  hearts; strife and hatred overshadowed humanity, bloodshed and violence  prevailed. God was neglected; the Sun of Reality seemed to have gone  completely; deprivation of the bounties of heaven was a fact; and so the  season of winter fell upon mankind. But in the generosity of God a new  springtime dawned, the lights of God shone forth, the effulgent Sun of  Reality returned and became manifest, the realm of thoughts and kingdom of  hearts became exhilarated, a new spirit of life breathed into the body of  the world and continuous advancement became apparent.    I hope that the lights of the Sun of Reality will illumine the whole world  so that no strife and warfare, no battles and bloodshed remain. May  fanaticism and religious bigotry be unknown, all humanity enter the bond  of brotherhood, souls consort in perfect agreement, the nations of earth  at last hoist the banner of truth and the religions of the world enter the  divine temple of oneness, for the foundations of the heavenly religions  are one reality. Reality is not divisible; it does not admit multiplicity.  All the holy Manifestations of God have proclaimed and promulgated the  same reality. They have summoned mankind to reality itself and reality is  one. The clouds and mists of imitations have obscured the Sun of Truth. We  must forsake these imitations, dispel these clouds and mists and free the  Sun from the darkness of superstition. Then will the Sun of Truth shine  most gloriously; then all the inhabitants of the world will be united, the  religions will be one, sects and denominations will reconcile, all  nationalities will flow together in the recognition of one Fatherhood and  all degrees of humankind gather in the shelter of the same tabernacle,  under the same banner.    Until the heavenly civilization is founded, no result will be forthcoming  from material civilization, even as you observe. See what catastrophes  overwhelm mankind. Consider the wars which disturb the world. Consider the  enmity and hatred. The existence of these wars and conditions indicates  and proves that the heavenly civilization has not yet been established. If  the civilization of the Kingdom be spread to all the nations, this dust of  disagreement will be dispelled, these clouds will pass away and the Sun of  Reality in its greatest effulgence and glory will shine upon mankind.          THE SOURCE OF UNITY      What is real unity? When we observe the human world we find various  collective expressions of unity therein. For instance, man is  distinguished from the animal by his degree or kingdom. This comprehensive  distinction includes all the posterity of Adam and constitutes one great  household or human family which may be considered the fundamental or  physical unity of mankind. Furthermore, a distinction exists between  various groups of humankind according to lineage, each group forming a  racial unity separate from the others. There is also the unity of tongue  among those who use the same language as a means of communication;  national unity where various peoples live under one form of government  such as French, German, British, etc.; and political unity which conserves  the civil rights of parties or factions of the same government. All these  unities are imaginary and without real foundation, for no real result  proceeds from them. The purpose of true unity is real and divine outcomes.  From these limited unities mentioned only limited outcomes proceed whereas  unlimited unity produces unlimited result. For instance, from the limited  unity of race or nationality the results at most are limited. It is like a  family living alone and solitary; there are no unlimited or universal  outcomes from it.    The unity which is productive of unlimited results is first a unity of  mankind which recognizes that all are sheltered beneath the overshadowing  glory of the All-Glorious; that all are servants of one God; for all  breathe the same atmosphere, live upon the same earth, move beneath the  same heavens, receive effulgence from the same sun and are under the  protection of one God. This is the most great unity, and its results are  lasting if humanity adheres to it; but mankind has hitherto violated it,  adhering to sectarian or other limited unities such as racial, patriotic  or unity of self-interests; therefore no great results have been  forthcoming. Nevertheless it is certain that the radiance and favors of  God are encompassing, minds have developed, perceptions have become acute,  sciences and arts are widespread and capacity exists for the proclamation  and promulgation of the real and ultimate unity of mankind which will  bring forth marvelous results. It will reconcile all religions, make  warring nations loving, cause hostile kings to become friendly and bring  peace and happiness to the human world. It will cement together the Orient  and Occident, remove forever the foundations of war and upraise the ensign  of the Most Great Peace. These limited unities are therefore signs of that  great unity which will make all the human family one by being productive  of the attractions of conscience in mankind.    Another unity is the spiritual unity which emanates from the breaths of  the Holy Spirit. This is greater than the unity of mankind. Human unity or  solidarity may be likened to the body whereas unity from the breaths of  the Holy Spirit is the spirit animating the body. This is a perfect unity.  It creates such a condition in mankind that each one will make sacrifices  for the other and the utmost desire will be to forfeit life and all that  pertains to it in behalf of another's good. This is the unity which  existed among the disciples of His Holiness Jesus Christ and bound  together the prophets and holy souls of the past. It is the unity which  through the influence of the divine spirit is permeating the Baha'is so  that each offers his life for the other and strives with all sincerity to  attain his good-pleasure. This is the unity which caused twenty thousand  people in Iran to give their lives in love and devotion to it. It made the  Bab the target of a thousand arrows and caused Baha'u'llah to suffer exile  and imprisonment forty years. This unity is the very spirit of the body of  the world. It is impossible for the body of the world to become quickened  with life without its vivification. His Holiness Jesus Christ--may my life  be a sacrifice to Him!--promulgated this unity among mankind. Every soul  who believed in Jesus Christ became revivified and resuscitated through  this spirit, attained to the zenith of eternal glory, realized the life  everlasting, experienced the second birth and rose to the acme of good  fortune.    In the Word of God there is still another unity, the oneness of the  Manifestations of God, His Holiness Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ,  Muhammad, the Bab and Baha'u'llah. This is a unity divine, heavenly,  radiant, merciful; the one reality appearing in its successive  manifestations. For instance, the sun is one and the same but its points  of dawning are various. During the summer season it rises from the  northern point of the ecliptic; in winter it appears from the southern  point of rising. Each month between it appears from a certain zodiacal  position. Although these dawning-points are different, the sun is the same  sun which has appeared from them all. The significance is the reality of  prophethood which is symbolized by the sun, and the holy Manifestations  are the dawning-places or zodiacal points.    There is also the divine unity or entity which is sanctified above all  concept of humanity. It cannot be comprehended nor conceived because it is  infinite reality and cannot become finite. Human minds are incapable of  surrounding that reality because all thoughts and conceptions of it are  finite, intellectual creations and not the reality of divine being which  alone knows itself. For example, if we form a conception of divinity as a  living, almighty, self-subsisting, eternal being, this is only a concept  apprehended by a human intellectual reality. It would not be the outward,  visible reality which is beyond the power of human mind to conceive or  encompass. We ourselves have an external, visible entity but even our  concept of it is the product of our own brain and limited comprehension.  The reality of divinity is sanctified above this degree of knowing and  realization. It has ever been hidden and secluded in its own holiness and  sanctity above our comprehending. Although it transcends our realization,  its lights, bestowals, traces and virtues have become manifest in the  realities of the prophets, even as the sun becomes resplendent in various  mirrors. These holy realities are as reflectors, and the reality of  divinity is as the sun which although it is reflected from the mirrors,  and its virtues and perfections become resplendent therein, does not stoop  from its own station of majesty and glory and seek abode in the mirrors;  it remains in its heaven of sanctity. At most it is this, that its lights  become manifest and evident in its mirrors or manifestations. Therefore  its bounty proceeding from them is one bounty but the recipients of that  bounty are many. This is the unity of God; this is oneness;--unity of  divinity, holy above ascent or descent, embodiment, comprehension or  idealization;--divine unity. The prophets are its mirrors;"]]]
