You may bring me  a brandy-and-soda. Not a large one. A couple of bath-tubs full  will be enough.\"    \"Very good, Mr. James.\"    \"And now leave me, Bayliss, for I would be alone. I have to make  a series of difficult and exhaustive tests to ascertain whether I  am still alive.\"    When the butler had gone, Jimmy adjusted the cushions, closed his  eyes, and remained for a space in a state of coma. He was trying,  as well as an exceedingly severe headache would permit, to recall  the salient events of the previous night. At present his memories  refused to solidify. They poured about in his brain in a fluid  and formless condition, exasperating to one who sought for hard  facts.    It seemed strange to Jimmy that the shadowy and inchoate vision of  a combat, a fight, a brawl of some kind persisted in flitting  about in the recesses of his mind, always just far enough away to  elude capture. The absurdity of the thing annoyed him. A man has  either indulged in a fight overnight or he has not indulged in a  fight overnight. There can be no middle course. That he should be  uncertain on the point was ridiculous. Yet, try as he would, he  could not be sure. There were moments when he seemed on the very  verge of settling the matter, and then some invisible person  would meanly insert a red-hot corkscrew in the top of his head  and begin to twist it, and this would interfere with calm  thought. He was still in a state of uncertainty when Bayliss  returned, bearing healing liquids on a tray.    \"Shall I set it beside you, sir?\"    Jimmy opened one eye.    \"Indubitably. No mean word, that, Bayliss, for the morning after.  Try it yourself next time. Bayliss, who let me in this morning?\"    \"Let you in, sir?\"    \"Precisely. I was out and now I am in. Obviously I must have  passed the front door somehow. This is logic.\"    \"I fancy you let yourself in, Mr. James, with your key.\"    \"That would seem to indicate that I was in a state of icy  sobriety. Yet, if such is the case, how is it that I can't  remember whether I murdered somebody or not last night? It isn't  the sort of thing your sober man would lightly forget. Have you  ever murdered anybody, Bayliss?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Well, if you had, you would remember it next morning?\"    \"I imagine so, Mr. James.\"    \"Well, it's a funny thing, but I can't get rid of the impression  that at some point in my researches into the night life of London  yestreen I fell upon some person to whom I had never been  introduced and committed mayhem upon his person.\"    It seemed to Bayliss that the time had come to impart to Mr. James  a piece of news which he had supposed would require no imparting.  He looked down upon his young master's recumbent form with a  grave commiseration. It was true that he had never been able to  tell with any certainty whether Mr. James intended the statements  he made to be taken literally or not, but on the present occasion  he seemed to have spoken seriously and to be genuinely at a loss  to recall an episode over the printed report of which the entire  domestic staff had been gloating ever since the arrival of the  halfpenny morning paper to which they subscribed.    \"Do you really mean it, Mr. James?\" he enquired cautiously.    \"Mean what?\"    \"You have really forgotten that you were engaged in a fracas last  night at the Six Hundred Club?\"    Jimmy sat up with a jerk, staring at this omniscient man. Then  the movement having caused a renewal of the operations of the  red-hot corkscrew, he fell back again with a groan.    \"Was I? How on earth did you know? Why should you know all about  it when I can't remember a thing? It was my fault, not yours.\"    \"There is quite a long report of it in to-day's _Daily Sun_, Mr.  James.\"    \"A report? In the _Sun_?\"    \"Half a column, Mr. James. Would you like me to fetch the paper?  I have it in my pantry.\"    \"I should say so. Trot a quick heat back with it. This wants  looking into.\"    Bayliss retired, to return immediately with the paper. Jimmy took  it, gazed at it, and handed it back.    \"I overestimated my powers. It can't be done. Have you any  important duties at the moment, Bayliss?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Perhaps you wouldn't mind reading me the bright little excerpt,  then?\"    \"Certainly, sir.\"    \"It will be good practice for you. I am convinced I am going to be  a confirmed invalid for the rest of my life, and it will be part  of your job to sit at my bedside and read to me. By the way, does  the paper say who the party of the second part was? Who was the  citizen with whom I went to the mat?\"    \"Lord Percy Whipple, Mr. James.\"    \"Lord who?\"    \"Lord Percy Whipple.\"    \"Never heard of him. Carry on, Bayliss.\"    Jimmy composed himself to listen, yawning.        CHAPTER V    THE MORNING AFTER    Bayliss took a spectacle-case from the recesses of his costume,  opened it, took out a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, dived into the  jungle again, came out with a handkerchief, polished the  spectacles, put them on his nose, closed the case, restored it to  its original position, replaced the handkerchief, and took up the  paper.    \"Why the hesitation, Bayliss? Why the coyness?\" enquired Jimmy,  lying with closed eyes. \"Begin!\"    \"I was adjusting my glasses, sir.\"    \"All set now?\"    \"Yes, sir. Shall I read the headlines first?\"    \"Read everything.\"    The butler cleared his throat.    \"Good Heavens, Bayliss,\" moaned Jimmy, starting, \"don't gargle.  Have a heart! Go on!\"    Bayliss began to read.             FRACAS IN FASHIONABLE NIGHT-CLUB                 SPRIGS OF NOBILITY BRAWL    Jimmy opened his eyes, interested.    \"Am I a sprig of nobility?\"    \"It is what the paper says, sir.\"    \"We live and learn. Carry on.\"    The butler started to clear his throat, but checked himself.             SENSATIONAL INTERNATIONAL CONTEST                       BATTLING PERCY                         (England)                             v                        CYCLONE JIM                         (America)               FULL DESCRIPTION BY OUR EXPERT    Jimmy sat up.    \"Bayliss, you're indulging that distorted sense of humour of  yours again. That isn't in the paper?\"    \"Yes, sir. Very large headlines.\"    Jimmy groaned.    \"Bayliss, I'll give you a piece of advice which may be useful to  you when you grow up. Never go about with newspaper men. It all  comes back to me. Out of pure kindness of heart I took young Bill  Blake of the _Sun_ to supper at the Six Hundred last night. This is  my reward. I suppose he thinks it funny. Newspaper men are a low  lot, Bayliss.\"    \"Shall I go on, sir?\"    \"Most doubtless. Let me hear all.\"    Bayliss resumed. He was one of those readers who, whether their  subject be a murder case or a funny anecdote, adopt a measured  and sepulchral delivery which gives a suggestion of tragedy and  horror to whatever they read. At the church which he attended on  Sundays, of which he was one of the most influential and  respected members, children would turn pale and snuggle up to  their mothers when Bayliss read the lessons. Young Mr. Blake's  account of the overnight proceedings at the Six Hundred Club he  rendered with a gloomy gusto more marked even than his wont. It  had a topical interest for him which urged him to extend himself.    \"At an early hour this morning, when our myriad readers  were enjoying that refreshing and brain-restoring sleep so  necessary to the proper appreciation of the _Daily Sun_ at  the breakfast table, one of the most interesting sporting  events of the season was being pulled off at the Six  Hundred Club in Regent Street, where, after three rounds  of fast exchanges, James B. Crocker, the well-known  American welter-weight scrapper, succeeded in stopping  Lord Percy Whipple, second son of the Duke of Devizes,  better known as the Pride of Old England. Once again the  superiority of the American over the English style of  boxing was demonstrated. Battling Percy has a kind heart,  but Cyclone Jim packs the punch.\"    \"The immediate cause of the encounter had to do with a  disputed table, which each gladiator claimed to have  engaged in advance over the telephone.\"    \"I begin to remember,\" said Jimmy meditatively. \"A pill with  butter-coloured hair tried to jump my claim. Honeyed words  proving fruitless, I soaked him on the jaw. It may be that I was  not wholly myself. I seem to remember an animated session at the  Empire earlier in the evening, which may have impaired my  self-control. Proceed!\"    \"One word leading to others, which in their turn led to  several more, Cyclone Jim struck Battling Percy on what  our rude forefathers were accustomed to describe as the  mazzard, and the gong sounded for                    \"ROUND ONE    \"Both men came up fresh and eager to mix things, though it  seems only too probable that they had already been mixing  more things than was good for them. Battling Percy tried a  right swing which got home on a waiter. Cyclone Jim put in  a rapid one-two punch which opened a large gash in the  atmosphere. Both men sparred cautiously, being hampered in  their movements by the fact, which neither had at this  stage of the proceedings perceived, that they were on  opposite sides of the disputed table. A clever Fitzsimmons'  shift on the part of the Battler removed this obstacle,  and some brisk work ensued in neutral territory. Percy  landed twice without a return. The Battler's round by a  shade.                    \"ROUND TWO    \"The Cyclone came out of his corner with a rush, getting  home on the Battler's shirt-front and following it up with  a right to the chin. Percy swung wildly and upset a bottle  of champagne on a neighbouring table. A good rally  followed, both men doing impressive in-fighting. The  Cyclone landed three without a return. The Cyclone's  round.                    \"ROUND THREE    \"Percy came up weak, seeming to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20069"],[0,"Caruso and Tetrazzini on the Art of Singing (#11)"],[1," evening. Yet the public, even  critics, usually forget this fact and condemn an entire performance for  faults which are due at the beginning to sheer nervousness.    The oft-uttered complaint that operatic singers are the most difficult  to get on with of any folk, while justified, perhaps, can certainly be  explained by the foregoing observations.    We of the opera are often inclined to be superstitious in a way that  might annul matter of fact Americans. One woman, a distinguished and  most intelligent artist, crosses herself repeatedly before taking her  \"cue,\" and a prima donna who is a favorite on two continents and who is  always escorted to the theatre by her mother, invariably goes through  the very solemn ceremony of kissing her mother good-by and receiving her  blessing before going on to sing. The young woman feels that she could  not possibly sing a note if the mother's eye were not on her every  moment from the wings.    Another famous singer wears a small bracelet that was given to her when  an infant by Gounod. She has grown somewhat stout of late years, and the  hoop of gold has been reenforced so often that there is hardly any of  the great composer's original gift left. Still, she feels that it is a  charm which has made her success, and whether she sings the part of a  lowly peasant or of a princess the bracelet is always visible.    And these little customs are not confined to the woman singers either,  for the men are equally fond of observing some little tradition to cheer  them in their performance. These little traits, trivial perhaps in  themselves, are of vital importance in that they create a sense of  security in the soul of the artist, who goes on his way, if not  rejoicing, at least convinced that the fates are not against him.    One of the penalties paid by the singers who are much in the public eye  is the constant demand made on them to listen to voices of vocal  aspirants--not always very young ones, strange to say. It is sad to  contemplate the number of people who think they can sing and are  destined by talent and temperament for operatic careers, who have been  led by misguided or foolish friends and too often by overambitious and  mercenary singing masters into spending time and money on their voices  in the fond hope of some day astonishing the world. Alas, they do not  realize that the great singers who are heard in the New York opera  houses have been picked from the world's supply after a process of most  drastic selection, and that it is only the most rarely exceptional voice  and talent which after long years of study and preparation become  worthy to join the elect.    I am asked to hear many who have voices with promise of beauty, but who  have obviously not the intelligence necessary to take up a career, for  it does require considerable intelligence to succeed in opera, in spite  of opinions to the contrary expressed by many. Others, who have keen and  alert minds and voices of fine quality, yet lack that certain esprit and  broadness of musical outlook required in a great artist. This lack is  often so apparent in the person's manner or bearing that I am tempted to  tell him it is no use before he utters a note. Yet it would not do to  refuse a hearing to all these misfits, for there is always the chance of  encountering the unknown genius, however rare a bird he may be.    And how often have the world's great voices been discovered by chance,  but fortunately by some one empowered to bring out the latent gift!    One finds in America many beautiful voices, and when one thinks of the  numerous singers successfully engaged in operatic careers both here and  abroad, it cannot with justice be said as it used to be several years  ago that America does not produce opera singers. Naturally a majority of  those to whom I give a hearing here in New York are Americans, and of  these are a number of really remarkable voices and a fairly good  conception of what is demanded of an opera singer.    Sometimes, however, it would be amusing if it were not tragic to see how  much off the track people are who have been led to think they have  futures. One young man who came recently to sing for me carried a  portentous roll of music and spoke in the deepest of bass voices. When  asked what his main difficulty was he replied that he \"didn't seem to be  able to get on the key.\" And this was apparent when he started in and  wandered up and down the tonal till he managed to strike the tonic. Then  he asked me whether I would rather hear \"Qui sdegno,\" from Mozart's  \"Magic Flute,\" or \"Love Me and the World is Mine.\" Upon the latter being  chosen he asked the accompanist to transpose it, and upon this  gentleman's suggesting a third lower, he said: \"No, put it down an  octave.\" And that's where he sang it, too. I gently but firmly advised  the young man to seek other paths than musical ones. However, such  extreme examples as that are happily rare.    I would say to all young people who are ambitious to enter on a career  of opera: Remember, it is a thoroughly hard-worked profession, after  all; that even with a voice of requisite size and proper cultivation  there is still a repertory of roles to acquire, long months and years of  study for this and requiring a considerable feat of memory to retain  them even after they are learned. Then there is the art of acting to be  studied, which is, of course, an entire occupation in itself and  decidedly necessary in opera, including fencing--how to fall properly,  the various gaits and gestures wherewith to portray different emotions,  etc. Then, as opera is sung nowadays, the knowledge of the diction of at  least three languages--French, German and Italian--if not essential, is  at least most helpful."]]]
