I'll have to see again if  I can help you.\"    So when they neared the garden of the Magic Grape-Vine, the Little Fox  leaped in the air, turned this way; and that, and lo! you might have  thought her the Golden Apple-Tree except that her fruit instead of being  round was long and pointed like a fox's head.    [Illustration: _The Golden Maiden, the Farmer and the Empty Ghost_]    Janko gave the king the fox tree and received in return the Magic  Grape-Vine that really belonged to his father and not to the king at  all. He hurried back to the Golden Maiden who was waiting for him with  the Golden Horse and the Golden Apple-Tree and the Golden Cradle and off  they all went.    The king was delighted with his fox tree and called his courtiers to  come and admire it.    \"Beautiful! Beautiful!\" they all said, and one of them examining the  fruit carefully remarked:    \"But see these apples! They are not round like apples but long and  pointed like a fox's head!\"    He had no sooner said the word _fox_ than the tree turned into a fox and  went scampering off.    \"See what you've done with your nonsense!\" cried the king. \"You have  lost me my Golden Apple-Tree and now I shall lose you your head!\" And he  ordered the courtier to be executed at once.    When the Fox caught up with the Golden Horse, she said to Janko:    \"Now, my brother, it is time for us to part. You have the Magic  Grape-Vine and soon your father's left eye will no longer weep. Besides,  you are carrying home the Golden Maiden on her own Golden Horse and with  her Golden Apple-Tree and her Golden Cradle. God has blessed you in your  undertaking and will continue to bless you so long as you are good and  kind. Farewell now and think sometimes of your sister, the Little Lame  Fox.\"    Janko wept at thought of parting with the Little Fox and the Little Fox  promised him that she would help him again if ever he needed her. Then  she turned and trotted off into the woods and Janko rode homewards  without her.    When he reached the crossroads where he had parted from his brothers  just one year before he came upon a crowd of angry farmers belaboring  two men who had been robbing their barns. Janko found that the two men  were his own brothers who since he had seen them had fallen into bad  company, lost all their money at cards, and had finally taken to  thieving. Janko paid the farmers for the damage his brothers had done  them and took his brothers home with him.    You can imagine the old farmer's happiness at seeing all three of his  sons after a whole year's absence. It was even greater than his delight  at getting back his Magic Grape-Vine. But that doesn't mean that he  wasn't delighted to have back the Grape-Vine. At the first cup of wine  that the Vine poured him, his left eye ceased weeping and it was never  known to weep again.    He was delighted, too, at having the Golden Maiden in the house and  pleased when people came from far and near to see the Maiden's Golden  Horse and Golden Apple-Tree and Golden Cradle. He even began to hope  that she might marry one of his sons before some prince came along and  snatched her away. He thought the Maiden would make a wonderful bride  for the oldest. Unfortunately Janko had not told him what reprobates the  two older sons were, and the older brothers themselves had given their  father to understand that it was really they who had found the Magic  Grape-Vine and rescued the Golden Maiden. You see instead of being  grateful to Janko for having saved their necks from the angry farmers,  they hated him worse than ever.    \"That Booby!\" the older brother growled. \"Just because he took the  left-hand road and found the Magic Grape-Vine he thinks himself so much  better than us! It was just luck--that's all it was! Any one who took  the left-hand road could have found the old Grape-Vine!\"    \"And do you notice the way the Golden Maiden always smiles on him?\" the  other said. \"The first thing we know she'll be marrying him and giving  him the Golden Horse and the Golden Apple-Tree and the Golden Cradle!  Then where will we be?\"    \"Brother,\" whispered the first, \"let us make away with him!\"    So they plotted together and they asked Janko to go hunting with them  the next day. Suspecting nothing Janko went. When they came to a deep  well in the woods they asked Janko to reach them a cup of water. As he  stooped over into the well they pushed him all the way in and drowned  him. That's the kind of brothers they were! Then they went home and  pretended to be surprised that Janko hadn't come home before them.    He didn't come that night or the next day either, and the Golden Maiden  grew sad and quiet, the Magic Grape-Vine no longer poured out its  precious wine every hour, the Golden Apple-Tree stopped putting forth  its buds and blossoms and golden fruit, and the Golden Horse languished  and drooped its lovely head.    \"Everything goes wrong when Janko isn't here!\" the farmer said. \"Where  can he be?\"    On the third day the Golden Maiden suddenly began to laugh and sing, the  Magic Grape-Vine again poured forth a bucket of precious wine every  hour, the Golden Apple-Tree put out buds and blossoms and golden fruit,  and the Golden Horse lifted its beautiful head and neighed loud and  happily. And do you know why? Because the Little Lame Fox had just  rescued Janko and brought him back to life! She pulled him out of the  well, and rolled him about on the ground, and worked over him until all  the water was emptied from his lungs and he was able to breathe again.    Then as he opened his eyes the Little Fox said:    \"I told you, brother, I'd come again if you needed my help. I was just  in time for a little longer and I could never have brought you back to  life. And now, brother, the enchantment that held me is broken and I  need no longer go about as a Little Lame Fox. My mother was a wicked  witch and she enchanted me because she was angry with me for saving a  man whom she wanted to kill. So she turned me into a little fox and she  said I should have to remain a fox forever unless I succeeded in  bringing back to life my benefactor. You are my benefactor, Janko, for  you shared your bread and cheese with me the first time we met, and now  I have been able to bring you back to life.\"    As she spoke she changed into a lovely maiden.    \"Good-by, Janko,\" she said. \"Go home now and tell your father how your  evil brothers have treated you. Unless you do this they will plot  against the Golden Maiden and you may not be able to protect her.\"    So Janko and the maiden kissed each other as a brother and sister might  and the maiden went her way and Janko returned to his father's house.    The Golden Maiden and the old farmer were not in the least surprised to  see him for things were so happy again that they just knew it must be  because Janko was coming back. But his two brothers when they caught  sight of him alive and well were so frightened that they took to their  heels and ran off as fast as they could go and what's more they've never  shown themselves since. And good riddance, too, I say, for they were  wicked evil fellows and would only have injured Janko further if they  could.    When Janko told his father all the wicked things they had done, the old  farmer could scarcely believe his ears.    \"And to think,\" he said, \"I had been hoping the Golden Maiden would  marry one of them! Mercy me! Mercy me!\"    \"But, father,\" the Golden Maiden said--she called him _father_ now and  it pleased him mightily; \"father, I should rather marry Janko!\"    \"Marry Janko!\" the farmer cried. \"Why, my dear, Janko is a stupid lad,  not nearly so clever as his two brothers!\"    \"I don't care if he is stupid. He's got a good heart and that's more  than the other two have. And besides that he's got a brave heart for he  rescued me from the dark cavern and he faced the awful ghost that stood  over my Golden Cradle. Why, father, I'd rather marry Janko than any  prince in the world!\"    You can imagine Janko's feelings when he heard this!    \"I'd feel like a prince if you did marry me, dear Golden One!\" he cried.    Well, she did marry him, and sure enough he did feel like a prince. What  prince, I'd like to know, had a lovelier bride? None! And was there any  prince in the world whose bride brought him greater riches than the  Golden Apple-Tree, the Golden Horse, and Golden Cradle? No, not one! And  furthermore the farmer promised that, when he died, he would leave him  the Magic Grape-Vine.    So Janko lived happy and prosperous. And it all came about through his  having a good honest heart.    [Illustration]    THE ENCHANTED PEAFOWL    [Illustration]    _The Story of the Golden Apples, the Wicked Dragon, and the Magic  Horse_          THE ENCHANTED PEAFOWL      _Have you ever heard the story of the Peafowl who became a Queen and of  the Tsar's Youngest Son who married her? Well, here it is:_    There was once a Tsar who took great delight in his garden. Every  morning you could see him bending over his flowers or picking the fruit  of his favorite tree. This was an apple-tree that had the magic property  of bearing buds, blossoms, and golden fruit every twenty-four hours. It  was known as the golden apple-tree. In the morning the first thing when  he woke up the Tsar would look out his bedroom window to see that all  was well with his beloved tree.    One morning when as usual he looked out he was grieved to see that the  tree had been stripped of all the golden fruit which had ripened during  the night.    \"Who has stolen my golden apples?\" he cried.    The palace guards looked everywhere for some trace of the thief but  found nothing.    The next morning the same thing had happened and every morning  thereafter when the Tsar looked out of his bedroom window he saw that  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19714"],[0,"With Frederick the Great: A Story of the Seven Years' War (#11)"],[1,"shook as she handed it  to Fergus.    \"Are you sure that he is not dead, sir?\" she asked, in a hushed  voice.    \"Quite sure. I fear that he is grievously wounded, but he certainly  lives. Now, get another glass and put some spirits in and fill it  up with water, and make your mother drink it, as soon as you have  roused her from her faint.\"    Fergus now gave all his attention to the wounded man, poured two or  three spoonfuls of strong spirits and water between his lips, and  then proceeded to examine his wounds. He had three. One was a very  severe cut upon the shoulder. His left arm had been broken by a  pistol bullet, and he had a dangerous sword thrust in the body.    Under Fergus' direction the servant had cut off the doublet and,  after pouring some more spirits down the wounded man's throat, he  bade one of the other women fetch him some soft linen, and a sheet.  When these arrived he made a pad of the linen, and bound it over  the wounded man's shoulder with some strips torn from the sheet.  Then he sent for some straight strips of wood, cut them to the  right length, wrapped some linen round them and, straightening the  arm, applied them to it and, with the assistance of the girl,  bandaged it firmly. Then he placed a pad of linen over the wound in  the body, and passed bandages round and round.    \"Well done!\" he said to his assistant. \"You are a stout girl, and a  brave one.\"    Then he turned to the others, who were crowded round their  mistress.    \"Stand back,\" he said, \"and throw open the window and let the air  come to her. That will do.    \"The young lady and this girl will be enough, now. Do the rest of  you run off and get some clothes on.\"    \"She has opened her eyes once, sir.\"    \"She will come round directly, young lady. Pour a spoonful or two  from this glass between her lips. It is stronger than that you have  in your hand. She has had a terrible shock, but as soon as she  hears that your father is alive, it will do more for her than all  our services.\"    \"Will he live, sir?\"    \"That I cannot say for certain, but I have great hopes that he will  do so. However, I will send a surgeon out, as soon as I get to the  city.\"    The lady was longer in her swoon than Fergus had expected, and the  servants had returned before she opened her eyes.    \"Now,\" he said, \"do four of you lend me your assistance. It would  be well to carry this sofa with your master into the next room; and  then we will take your mistress in there, too, so that she will be  spared seeing these ruffians scattered about, when she comes to  herself.\"    The doors leading to the adjoining apartment were opened, candles  lighted there, and the wounded man carried in on his sofa.    \"And now for your mistress. It will be easier to lift her out of  the chair, and carry her in bodily.\"    This he did, with the assistance of two of the servants.    \"Now,\" he said to the young girl, \"do you stay by her, my brave  maid. I think she will recover in a minute or two. Her eyelids  moved as I brought her in. I will look round and see about things.    \"Were these the only two men in the house?\" he asked the other  women, as he joined them on the landing.    \"No, sir. There were six men. The other four have gone to bed, but  the two outside always waited up till the count and countess  retired.\"    \"Where are their rooms?\" he asked, taking a candle.    One of the women led him upstairs. As he expected, he found the  four men lying dead. One had apparently leapt up as the door was  opened, and the other three had been killed in their beds.    \"Where can I get help from?\"    \"There are the men at the stables. It is at the back of the house,  three or four hundred yards away.\"    \"Well, take one of the other women with you, and go and rouse them.  Tell them to dress and come here, at once.\"    He now went down to the gate, undid the fastening, and then led his  horse up to the house. In a few minutes the stablemen arrived. He  ordered them to carry the bodies of the six marauders out, and lay  them in front of the house. When they had done so, they were to  take those of the servants and place them in an outhouse. Then he  went upstairs again.    \"The countess has recovered, sir,\" one of the women said.    \"Tell her that I will send one of the army surgeons down, at once.  But first, bandage my arm. It is but a flesh wound, I know; but I  am feeling faint, and am sure that it is keeping on bleeding.    \"Here, my girl,\" he said to the one who had before assisted, \"I can  trust to you not to faint.\"    With her assistance he took off his coat, the arm of which was  saturated with blood.    \"You had better cut off the sleeve of the shirt,\" he said.    This was done, and the nature of the wound was seen. A ball had  ploughed through the flesh three inches below the shoulder,  inflicting a gaping but not serious wound.    \"It is lucky that it was not the inside of the arm,\" he said to the  girl, as she bandaged it up; \"for had it been, I should have bled  to death in a very few minutes.    \"Has the count opened his eyes yet?\"    \"No, sir. He is lying just as he was.\"    \"What is the gentleman's name?\"    \"Count Eulenfurst.\"    \"You had better give me a draught of wine, before I start. I feel  shaken, and it is possible that riding may set my wound bleeding  again.\"    Having drunk a goblet of wine, Fergus went down and mounted his  horse. As he did so, he said to one of the men:    \"Take a lantern, and go down to the spot where the road hither  turns off from the main road. A surgeon will be here in half an  hour, or perhaps in twenty minutes. He will be on the lookout for  you and your lantern.\"    Events had passed quickly, and the church bell chimed a quarter to  eleven as he rode through the streets of Dresden. In three minutes  he drew up at the entrance to the royal quarters. As he dismounted,  Karl came out.    \"Keep the horse here, Karl,\" he said. \"It may be wanted in a minute  or two again.\"    \"Are you hurt, sir?\" the man asked as he dismounted, for he saw his  face by the light of the torches on each side of the gateway.    \"It is only a flesh wound, and of no consequence; but I have lost a  good deal of blood.\"    He made his way up the staircase to the marshal's quarters. He was  feeling dizzy and faint, now.    \"Is the marshal in his room?\" he asked.    \"He is in, sir, but--\"    \"I would speak to him immediately. 'Tis a most urgent matter.\"    The servant went in, a moment later held the door open, and said:    \"Will you enter, sir?\"    Fergus entered, and made the usual formal salute to the marshal.  Two or three other officers were in the room, but he did not heed  who they were, nor hear the exclamations of surprise that broke out  at his appearance.    \"I beg to report, sir, that the house of the Count Eulenfurst has  been attacked by marauders, belonging to one of the Pomeranian  regiments. The count is desperately wounded, and I pray that a  surgeon may be sent instantly to his aid. The house stands back  from the road, about half a mile from the north gate. A man with a  lantern will be standing in the road to guide him to it. My horse  is at the door below, in readiness to take him. I pray you to allow  me to retire.\"    He swayed and would have fallen, had not the marshal and one of the  others present caught him, and laid him down on a couch.    \"He is wounded, marshal,\" the other officer said. \"This sleeve is  saturated with blood.\"    The marshal raised his voice, and called an attendant:    \"Run to the quarters of staff surgeon Schmidt, and ask him to come  here immediately, and to bring another of his staff with him, if  there is one in.\"    In two minutes the king's chief surgeon entered, followed by  another of his staff.    \"First look to the wound of Cornet Drummond,\" the marshal said. \"It  is in the arm, and I trust that he has only fainted from loss of  blood.\"    The surgeons examined the wound.    \"It is in no way serious, marshal. As you say, he has fainted from  loss of blood. He must have neglected it for some time. Had it been  bandaged at once, it would only have had the consequence of  disabling his arm for a fortnight or so.\"    The assistant had already hurried away to get lint and bandages.  Another voice now spoke.    \"Surgeon Schmidt, you will please at once mount Mr. Drummond's  horse, which is standing at the door. Ride out through the north  gate. When you have gone about half a mile you will see a man with  a lantern. He will lead you to the house of Count Eulenfurst, who  has been grievously wounded by some marauders. Surgeon Morfen will  follow you, as soon as he has bandaged Mr. Drummond's wounds. There  may be more wounded there who may need your care.    \"Major Armfeldt, will you order a horse to be brought round at once  for the surgeon, then hurry to the barracks. Order the colonel to  turn out a troop of horse instantly, and let him scour the country  between the north gate and the camp, and arrest every straggler he  comes across.\"        Chapter 4: Promotion.      As soon as the bandage was applied and the flow of blood ceased, a  few spoonfuls of wine were poured down the patient's throat. It was  not long before he opened his eyes and struggled into a sitting  position.    \"I beg pardon, sir,\" he said faintly, as his eyes fell on the  marshal, who was standing just in front of him. \"I am sorry that I  came into your apartments in this state, but it seemed to me--\"    \"You did quite right, sir,\" said a sharp voice that he at once  recognized, while the speaker put his hand upon his shoulder, to  prevent him from trying to rise. \"You were quite right to bring the  news here at once of this outrage; which, by heavens, shall be  punished as it deserves. Now drink a cup of wine, and then perhaps  you will be able to tell us a little more about it. Now don't be in  a hurry, but obey my orders.\"    Fergus drank off the wine; then, after waiting a minute or two,  said:    \"Count"]]]
