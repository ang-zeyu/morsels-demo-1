They were highly incensed at their new  neighbours, springing with all their force against the partition, with  low growlings, casting up the cocoa fibre with their hind legs, as if to  try and hide them from their view. They soon found a little chink,  through which, I am afraid, some very strong language was launched at  the new-comers.    Happily the gerbilles did not mind. They found delightful tree-roots to  gnaw at, plenty of food, and freedom to frisk and frolic to their  heart's content, so their neighbours were free to growl as much as they  liked, and they in their turn raised a hill of fibre and played at  hide-and-seek in their new domain.    But let me now describe these gerbilles. I believe there are several  species, differing somewhat in appearance. These were fawn-coloured,  with sleek, soft fur, which, like the chinchilla, was blueish next to  the skin. They were about the size of small rats, with little ears and  long tails, with a black tuft at the end. The fur was white underneath,  the eyes jet black and very large, and long black whiskers, which were  always in motion. The hind legs being longer than the front ones,  enabled the creature to spring and leap along the ground with great  rapidity, as I found to my cost one night, when five of them got out of  their case and gave us an hour's occupation before they could be  recaptured. One managed to get inside an American organ, and effectually  baffled all our efforts to secure him. There was no help for it, he had  to be left there, and I went away with an anxious mind as to what his  busy teeth would be employed upon all night; and, sure enough, next  morning a velvet curtain was found nibbled and tattered, and being  converted into a nest for the enterprising gerbille! They became very  amusing, tame little creatures, ready to take dandelions, nuts, or any  little dainty, from one's hand.    As they breed very readily in England, I was soon presented with a  little family of five very tiny, pinkish-coloured infants, quite blind,  and destitute of hair. They were not attractive, and so were left to  their mother's care till they could see and were properly clothed, and  then they were extremely pretty, and rapidly developed all the habits  and manners of their parents, gnawing wood, nibbling nuts, and having  merry games of their own, darting with wonderful quickness in and out of  the tree-roots, and getting up small battles for some coveted morsel of  diet. The first pair were quiet enough, and agreed happily together, but  when, later on, mother and daughter happened to have a little brood at  the same time, things became complicated, and it was no uncommon sight  to see the two mothers careering about, each with an infant in its  mouth, and it often fell to my lot to take care of the unfortunate  children and replace them in the nest whilst the mothers had a  \"stand-up\" fight, and this is a literally true expression, for gerbilles  sit bolt upright and fight each other with their front feet; but, though  they appear to be in desperate conflict, I must say I never saw that any  damage was done. As to their gnawing power, it is almost beyond  description. I gave them a strong wooden box as a nursery for the young  gerbilles, but before long they had eaten out the back and sides, and a  mere skeleton of a box remained. There was a piece of zinc, which formed  a partition, but they ate a hole right through the zinc in no time, and  when a wire cage, with a sliding door, was placed in the plant case,  they soon learnt how to lift up the door and get out. We often watched  the formation of the family nest, which was constructed of wool and hay  nibbled very small, and carried by mouthfuls and woven together. It  generally had two outlets for ingress and egress. There the entire  family would sleep during the day amicably enough, but towards evening  the nursery disputes would begin, and old animosities led to frequent  battles and scrimmages, because somebody wanted some one else's pieces  of wool for the precious infants. Still they were very tame, amusing  little creatures, liking to be stroked and fed and rewarded by a run  upon the breakfast-table, where they would examine every dish and plate  in a delicate, inquiring way, not touching the contents--only trying to  add to their small amount of knowledge of the outside world. Their food  consisted of bran, oats, pea-nuts, wheat, fresh dandelion and  clover-leaves, and on these they lived in perfect health and beauty.    As the colony increased, it was needful to make several homes for the  gerbilles, and the original pair happened to be, for a time, in a cage  upstairs on a landing. One of these found its way out of the cage, down  the stairs, across the hall, and was discovered next morning in a room  where the younger members of the family were kept. This would go to  prove a keen scent, which, I suppose, guided the little animal to find  its friends, and also confirms what travellers have written about  gerbilles living in large colonies and always keeping together.    One evening I had to read some natural history papers at a Band of Mercy  meeting in a neighbouring village, where the clergyman's wife took great  interest in promoting kindness to animals, and as I proposed speaking  about the gerbilles, I thought I would take some of them with me to show  the children. Accordingly a mother and four little ones, were put into a  cage with some food and bedding for their comfort whilst being  exhibited. I was concerned to see the extreme terror they seemed to feel  at the unusual motion of the carriage, and in a few minutes one became  convulsed and literally died of fright. I held the cage in my lap, and  talked to the others to reassure them, fearing more casualties, but  after a while they settled down, and we reached the schoolroom in due  time. I was scarcely prepared for the tremendous sensation the gerbilles  created. Remarks in broad Hertfordshire greeted their appearance. \"Whoy,  here's a lot of moise.\" \"Noa, they ain't; they's rats!\" \"Will they  boite?\" and then such a cluster of children came round me they had to be  called to order, and the cage was carried round that all might see the  little foreigners, and through all the after-proceedings many pairs of  eyes remained fixed upon the cage and its inmates. I fancy that evening  will long be remembered by the children.    The great difficulty that attends the keeping of these little animals is  their rapid rate of increase. It is true they can all be kept together,  for, as I have said, though there are squabbles they do not result in  any personal injury, and thus my colony was allowed to go on till there  was no counting the number of generations that existed. I very much  wished to reduce the numbers, and give some away, but could never tell  which were the mothers of the small pink infants I was being presented  with continually. I tried putting a little family of the babies into a  cage in the plant case, hoping the mother who belonged to them would  then appear and take care of them; but no, the entire colony trooped in  and ran riot in the new place, and if a young gerbille was by chance  left uncovered in the _melee_, a twentieth cousin would take it up  tenderly as if it was its own mother, and replace it in the nest--a very  emblem of brotherly kindness and charity. The colony had finally to be  dispersed and given away in small detachments to different friends, and,  strange to say, in no other case did the numbers increase, I imagine  because the requisite conditions of space and quietness were not  realized as in the pleasant home I was able to provide for them.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    WATER SHREWS.      Hearing that the little patients in a London hospital had scarcely any  toys, and that they especially desired a very large doll, I had one  dressed for them, and various other interesting items, such as an album  of pictures, bags of shells, a stamp snake, &c., were prepared; but a  large box was needed in which to pack all these treasures; and one which  had been for months in the wine-cellar was brought up for that purpose  into the hall.    It was filled with straw, and as I was watching this being taken out I  noticed some small black animals darting about in it.    \"They must be young rats,\" I exclaimed, \"and the rare kind, too--the  black rat, which has been almost entirely eradicated by the stronger  brown species.\" A curious instance, by the way, of a foreign interloper  driving out the native.    I immediately resolved to secure these animals, whatever they might  prove to be, and, armed with leather gloves, and an empty glass globe to  place my captures in, I began to search in the straw, and soon secured  the supposed rats, but they proved to be a pair of water shrews--jet  black, lively little creatures, with sharply-pointed snouts and teeth,  as I soon discovered to my cost. I had taken off my gloves and was  watching the activity of the shrews, when suddenly they flew upon each  other, biting and screaming with rage, and, thinking they would kill  each other at that rate, I tried to separate them, but one turned and  bit me pretty severely, and it was with some difficulty they were  parted. One I put into a zinc fern case, and the other into a large  empty aquarium, with shingle at the bottom, moss and wool for bedding,  and a large pan of water for swimming and bathing.    They were rather larger than the common mouse, jet black above, and  greyish-white beneath--restless, active creatures, usually found near  ponds and ditches; and how ever these two had found their way into a dry  cellar, and lived in a box of straw will always remain a mystery. I  learnt from books that they fed on worms and insects, and that diet was  provided, though much to my distress, for it is a miserable thing to see  any living creature tortured and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21137"],[0,"Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life (#11)"],[1,"several things struck us which we had not previously noticed.  One  was that the wind had shifted farther north, and was blowing hard right  into the bay, gathering strength every minute.  Hall, we noticed, was  sailing as close as possible up to it, thus making our course far wider  than that which had brought us in the morning.    \"Why are you steering out like that?\"  I ventured to ask.    \"Because if I didn't-- Look out!\" he exclaimed, as a sudden gust caught  the boat, making her stagger and reel like a drunken man.  In an instant  he had released the sheet rope, and the sail flapped with a tremendous  noise about the mast.  It was but an instant, however, and then we saw  him coolly tighten the cord again, and put back the helm to its former  course.  After that I did not care to repeat my question.    Reader, have you ever found yourself at sea in an open boat, a mile or  so from land, in a gathering storm; with the wind in your teeth and the  sea rising ominously under your keel; with the black clouds mustering  overhead, and the distant coastline whitening with breakers?  Have you  marked the headlands change from white to solemn purple?  Have you  listened to that strange hiss upon the water, and that moaning in the  wind?  Have you known your boat to fly through the waves without making  way, and noted anxiously by some landmark that she is rather drifting  back with the current, instead of, as it seems, tearing before the wind?    If so, you can imagine our feelings that afternoon.    It was useless to pretend things were not as bad as they looked; it was  useless not to admit to ourselves we were fairly in for it now, and must  brave it out as best we could; it was useless to maintain we had not  been foolish, wickedly foolish, in starting on so venturesome an  expedition; it was useless to deny that it would have been better had we  remained at Shargle, or returned to Parkhurst by land.    We were in for it now.    The one thing which gave us confidence was Hall's coolness, now that the  danger was unmistakable.  He neither allowed himself to get flurried nor  alarmed, but sat with closed lips watching the sail--one hand on the  tiller and the other grasping the sheet, ready to let it go at a  moment's notice.    As for us, we wished we could do anything more active than sit still and  trim the boat.  But even that was some use, and so we remained, watching  anxiously the clouds as they rolled down the sides of the hills and half  obscured Shargle Head from our view.    Presently, however, Hall said--    \"Get the oars out, will you? we haven't made any way for an hour.\"    No way for an hour!  Had we then been all that time plunging through the  waves for nothing?  With what grim earnestness we set to work to row  through this unyielding current!    But to no effect--or scarcely any.  The little white cottage on Shargle,  which we looked round at so anxiously from time to time, to ascertain  what progress had been made, remained always in the same position, and  after twenty minutes' desperate pulling it seemed as if the total  distance gained had been scarcely half a dozen yards.    It was disheartening work, still more so as the sea was rising every  minute, and the rain had already begun to fall.    \"We're in for a gale,\" said Hall, as a wave broke over the side,  drenching Hutton and me, and half-filling the bottom of the boat with  water.  \"Look sharp, Charlie, and bale out that before the next comes.\"    Charlie set to work with a will, and for a time we rowed steadily on,  without saying a word.    \"What's the time?\"  I asked presently of Hall, as I saw him take out his  watch.    \"Five,\" said he.    It was an hour after the time we had expected to be back at Parkhurst,  and we were not yet clear of Shargle.  The same thought evidently  crossed the minds of the other three, for they all glanced in the  direction of Raven Cliff, now scarcely visible through the heavy rain.    \"I wish we were safe home,\" muttered Hutton, the most dispirited of our  crew.  \"What fools we were to come!\"    We said nothing, but pulled away doggedly at the oars.    Now it really seemed as if we were making some progress out of that  wretched current, for the white cottage on the cliff appeared farther  astern than it had done since we began to row, and we were beginning to  congratulate ourselves on our success, when Hall, who had for some time  been anxiously watching the shore, cried out--    \"For goodness' sake pull hard, you fellows! we are drifting in fast.  Here, Charlie, take the helm, and keep her the way she is, while I get  down the sail.  It's no use now.  Mind your heads, but don't stop  rowing,\" he shouted to us, as he let down the sail suddenly, and lowered  the mast.  \"Keep her head out, Charlie, whatever you do.  Let go that  rope beside you.  That's right.  Now take hold of that end of the mast  and slip it under the seat.\"    So saying he managed to get down the mast and stow it away without  impeding either the rowing or the steering, and immediately the  advantage of the step was manifest in the steadier motion of the boat,  although we groaned inwardly at the thought of having now all the  distance to row.  At least I groaned inwardly.  Hutton was hardly as  reserved.    \"I tell you what,\" he said to me, stopping rowing, \"I don't know what  you and the other fellows intend to do, but I can't row any more.  I've  been at it an hour together.\"    \"What are we to do, then?\" inquired I.    \"Why shouldn't Hall take a turn?  He's been doing nothing.\"    \"He's been steering,\" replied I, \"and he's the only fellow who knows  how, and Charlie's not strong enough to row.\"    \"Well, all I can say is, I don't mean to row any longer.\"    All this had been said in an undertone to me, but now Hall cried out--    \"What are you shopping for, Hutton?  Pull away, man, or we shall never  get out of this.\"    \"Pull away yourself!\" said Hutton sulkily.  \"I've had enough of it.  You  brought us here, you'd better take us back!\"    Hall's face at that moment was a study.  I fancy if this had been a ship  and he the skipper, he would not have hesitated an instant how to deal  with this unexpected contingency.  But now he did hesitate.  It was  bitter enough punishment to him to be there exposed to all the dangers  of a sudden storm, with the safety, and perhaps the life, not only of  himself, but of us whom he had induced to accompany him, on his hands;  but to have one of those comrades turn against him in the moment of  peril was more than he had looked for.    \"I'll take an oar,\" said Charlie, before there was time to say anything.    \"No,\" said Hall, starting up; \"take the helm, Charlie.  And you,\" added  he, to Hutton, \"give me your oar and get up into the bows.\"    The voice in which this was spoken, and the look of scorn which  accompanied it, fairly cowed Hutton, who got up like a lamb and crawled  into the bows, leaving Hall and me to row.    \"Keep her straight to the waves, whatever you do! it's all up if she  gets broadside on!\" said the former to Charlie.    And so for another half-hour we laboured in silence; then almost  suddenly the daylight faded, and darkness fell over the bay.    I rowed on doggedly in a half-dream.  Stories of shipwrecks and  castaways crowded in on my mind; I found myself wondering how and when  this struggle would end.  Then my mind flew back to Parkhurst, and I  tried to imagine what they must think there of our absence.  Had they  missed us yet?  Should I ever be back in the familiar house, or--but I  dared not think of that.  Then I tried to pray, and the sins of my  boyhood came up before my mind as I did so in terrible array, so that I  vowed, if but my life might be spared, I would begin a new and better  life from that time forward.  Then, by a strange impulse, my eyes rested  on Charlie, as he sat there quietly holding the tiller in his hands and  gazing out ahead into the darkness.  What was it that filled me with  foreboding and terror as I looked at the boy?  The scene of the morning  recurred to my mind, and my halfhearted effort to prevent him from  accompanying us.  Selfish wretch that I had been! what would I not now  give to have been resolute then?  If anything were to happen to Charlie,  how could I ever forgive myself?    \"I think we've made some way,\" he cried out cheerily.  \"Not much,\" said  Hall gloomily; \"that light there is just under Shargle Head.\"    \"Had we better keep on as we are?\"  I asked.  \"I don't see what else is  to be done.  If we let her go before the wind, we shall get right on to  the rocks.\"    \"You've a lot to answer for,\" growled Hutton from where he lay, half-  stupid with terror, in the bows.    Hall said nothing, but dashed his oar vehemently into the water and  continued rowing.    \"I wonder if that light is anywhere near Parkhurst?\" presently asked  Archer.  \"Do you see?\"    We looked, and saw it; and then almost instantly it vanished.  At the  same time we lost sight of the lights on Shargle Head, and the rain came  down in torrents.  \"A mist!\" exclaimed Hall, in tones of horror.  Well  indeed might he and we feel despair at this last extinguisher of our  hopes.  With no landmark to steer by, with wind and sea dead in our  teeth, with the waves breaking in over our sides, and one useless  mutineer in our midst, we felt that our fate was fairly sealed.  Even  Hall for a moment showed signs of alarm, and we heard him mutter to  himself, \"God help us now!\"  Next moment a huge wave came broadside on  to us and emptied itself into our boat, half filling us with water.  In  the sudden shock my oar was dashed from my hand and carried away  overboard!    \"Never mind,\" said Hall hurriedly, \"it would have been no use; put her  round, Charlie, quick--here, give me the tiller!\"    In a moment the boat swung round to the wind (not, however, before she  had shipped another sea), and then we felt we were simply flying towards  the fatal rocks.
