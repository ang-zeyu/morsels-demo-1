The house by a large majority-resolved, that the 45th No. of the \"North  Briton\" was a false, scandalous, and seditious libel, and ordered that  the said paper should be burned by the hands of the common hangman.  In reply, Wilkes declared that the rights of all the members had been  violated in his person, and he requested that the question of privilege  should be at once taken into consideration. The house adjourned this  question for one week, but on the same night, Lord Sandwich produced in  the house of lords, a copy of the \"Essay on Woman,\" and loudly exclaimed  against the profaneness and indecency of this poetical production of  Wilkes. His attack on Wilkes surprised most men who heard him, but he  was followed by one who had a right to complain. Dr. Warburton, now  Bishop of Gloucester, inveighed bitterly on the use which had been made  of his name in the annotations, and commented in severe language on the  outrageous infidelity of the production, declaring that when the author  of it arrived in hell, he would not find one companion there among its  \"blackest fiends.\" A day was appointed for bringing John Wilkes to their  lordship's bar, to answer to a charge of a breach of privilege; but in  the meantime, an event occurred which rendered it impossible for him  to appear. In the course of the debate in the lower house, Mr. Martin,  member for Camelford, who had been secretary to the treasury during  Bute's administration, and had been attacked in the \"North Briton,\"  stigmatized Wilkes as a \"cowardly, malignant, and scandalous scoundrel.\"  His words were twice repeated, as he looked across the house at the  object of his attack, with rage flashing from his eyes. Wilkes seemed  to hear with cool indifference, but on leaving the house, he addressed a  note to Martin, and a meeting in Hyde Park was the consequence, in which  the former was dangerously wounded. It was reported the next day that  he was delirious, and crowds of people surrounded his house, hooting  and shouting at his murderers: had he died, the populace would have  considered him a martyr in the cause of liberty; but he recovered.    The question of privilege came on in the house of commons on the 23rd of  November, and it lasted two whole days. Wilkes was defended by Pitt, who  came to the house again enveloped in flannel, and this time supported by  crutches. While Pitt defended him, however, he was careful to maintain  his own character. He condemned the whole series of \"North Britons,\"  as illiberal, unmanly, and detestable; declaimed against all national  reflections, as having a tendency to promote disloyal feelings and  disunity: asserted that his majesty's complaint was well founded, just,  and necessary; and declared that the author did not deserve to rank  among the human species, as he was the blasphemer of his God, and the  libeller of his sovereign. He was not connected with Wilkes, he said,  nor had he any connexion with writers of his stamp. At the same time, he  reprobated the facility with which parliament was surrendering its own  privileges, carefully impressing on the house, that in so doing, he  was simply delivering a constitutional opinion, and not vindicating the  character of John Wilkes. The speech of Pitt was characterised by great  eloquence and acuteness, but the measure was warmly defended by other  members, and at the conclusion, a resolution was carried by a large  majority, to the effect, \"That the privilege of parliament does not  extend to the case of writing and publishing seditious libels, nor ought  to be allowed to obstruct the ordinary course of the laws in the speedy  and effectual prosecution of so heinous and dangerous an offence.\"  The concurrence of the lords was not obtained without considerable  difficulty, and when it was obtained, a spirited protest was signed  by seventeen peers, affirming it to be \"incompatible with the dignity,  gravity, and justice of the house, thus to explain away a parliamentary  privilege of such magnitude and importance, founded in the wisdom of  ages, declared with precision in their standing orders, repeatedly  confirmed, and hitherto preserved inviolable by the spirit of their  ancestors; called to it only by the other house on a particular  occasion, and to serve a particular purpose, _ex post facto, ex  parte, et pendente lite_, the courts below.\" On the 1st of December, a  conference of both houses took place, when both lords and commons agreed  in a loyal address to the king, expressive of their detestation of the  libels against him; and Wilkes was ordered to attend at the bar of the  commons in a week, should his health permit.    In the meantime--on the 3rd of the month--there was a terrible riot in  London occasioned, by the burning of the \"North Briton\" in Cheapside.  The execution of this sentence was entrusted to Alderman Harley,  sheriff of London, and he assembled the city officers and the common  hangman at the Royal Exchange, to put it into effect. The people,  however, manifested a very different spirit from that of their  representatives. So violent were they, that Harley was compelled  to retreat to the Mansion House, where the lord mayor was sitting,  surrounded by members of the common council, who were almost to a man  the friends and admirers of Wilkes, and therefore not disposed to take  part in the matter. The hangman was compelled to follow the sheriff. He  had succeeded in partially burning the paper with a link, when cheered  on by some gentlemen standing at the windows of houses near the spot,  the mob rushed upon him, and rescued the fragments, carrying them in  triumph to Temple Bar, where a fire was kindled and a large jack-boot  was committed to the flames, in derision of the Earl of Bute. The city  was restored to its usual tranquillity in about an hour and a half,  the mob dispersing of their own accord; but the affair occupied the  attention of parliament four days, during which time nothing else was  done, except voting a pension of L80,000 as a dowry to the Princess  Augusta, the king's sister, who was about to be married to the Duke  of Brunswick. In the debate on the subject of the riot, it was fully  manifested that the populace of London was generally in favour of  Wilkes; but both houses concurred in voting that the rioters were  disturbers of the public peace, dangerous to the liberties of the  country, and obstructors of national justice. Thanks were also voted to  the sheriffs, and an address was presented to his majesty, praying that  measures might be taken to discover and punish the offenders.    By their proceedings against Wilkes ministers had surrounded themselves  with a maze of perplexity. Actions were brought by the printers, and  others arrested under the general warrant, to recover damages for false  imprisonment, and a verdict was universally given in their favour. These  actions were brought against the messengers: Wilkes had nobler game  in view. He brought actions against the two secretaries of state,  Lord Egremont and Lord Halifax, and against Robert Wood, Esq., late  under-secretary. Egremont was now dead, Halifax stood upon his privilege  and defied the court, till relieved by the sentence of outlawry that was  passed upon Wilkes, but Wood was condemned to pay L1000 damages to the  plaintiff. At this trial, the lord chief justice Pratt was bold enough  to declare that general warrants were unconstitutional, illegal, and  absolutely void, and to challenge a reference of this opinion to the  twelve judges. This was not deemed expedient, and Pratt's judgment  respecting the illegality of warrants was shortly afterwards confirmed  by the court of king's bench. The boldness of Pratt secured for him  great popularity. He was presented with the freedom of the cities of  London and Dublin, and others; and in addition to this mark of respect,  the corporation of London requested that he would sit for his picture,  which was to be placed in Guildhall, as a memorial of their gratitude.    The popularity of Wilkes was at this time increased by an attempt made  upon his life by one Alexander Dun, a Scotchman, who sought admission  into the patriot's house, and who publicly declared that he and ten  others were determined to cut him off. A new penknife was found in his  pocket, and for this alleged attempt against the life of a member of  parliament, Dun was carried before the commons, who voted him insane,  and ordered his dismissal. The court of king's bench, however, committed  Dun to prison for want of bail and securities, and looking upon facts  only in a cursory light, the people believed that the government was  determined to make away with the defender of their liberties. All this  tended to render the cabinet so obnoxious, that Horace Walpole was  apprehensive that there would have been some violent commotion.    When the day arrived for the attendance of Wilkes at the bar of the  house of commons, two medical gentlemen, Dr. Brocklesby and Mr. Graves  appeared, and made a declaration that he was unable, from the state of  his health, to obey the summons. The house granted a week's delay, and  the excuse being repeated, the grant was extended beyond the Christmas  recess. At the same time it was ordered that a physician and surgeon of  their own appointing should see Wilkes, and report their opinion on his  case. These were refused admittance into his house; but to vindicate the  character of his own medical attendants, and to have the laugh at the  ministry, he called in two Scotch doctors, observing that as the house  wished him to be watched, two Scotchmen would prove the most proper  spies.    The Christmas recess arrived, and the Christmas festivities afforded a  short truce to this war of politicians. Wilkes, who could not have been  so ill as represented, went to Paris, where he obtained great admiration  by his wit in the salons"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19226"],[0,"The Dog's Book of Verse (#11)"],[1,"sight,    All round, in hollow or on height,    Nor shout nor whistle strikes his ear.    What is the creature doing here?      It was a cove, a huge recess    That keeps, till June, December's snow;    A lofty precipice in front,    A silent tarn below.    Far in the bosom of Helvellyn,    Remote from public road or dwelling,    Pathway, or cultivated land,    From trace of human foot or hand.      There sometimes doth a leaping fish    Send through the tarn a lonely cheer;    The crags repeat the raven's croak    In symphony austere;    Thither the rainbow comes--the cloud,    And mists that spread the flying shroud,    And sunbeams, and the sounding blast,    That, if it could, would hurry past,    But that enormous barrier binds it fast.      Not free from boding thoughts, a while    The shepherd stood; then makes his way    Towards the dog, o'er rocks and stones,    As quickly as he may;    Nor far had gone before he found    A human skeleton on the ground;    The appalled discoverer, with a sigh,    Looks round, to learn the history      From whose abrupt and perilous rocks    The man had fallen, that place of fear!    At length upon the shepherd's mind    It breaks, and all is clear:    He instantly recalled the name    And who he was, and whence he came;    Remembered, too, the very day    On which the traveller passed this way.      But hear a wonder, for whose sake    This lamentable tale I tell!    A lasting monument of words    This wonder merits well.    The dog, which still was hovering nigh,    Repeating the same timid cry--    This dog had been through three months' space    A dweller in that savage place.      Yes, proof was plain that since the day    When this ill-fated traveller died,    The dog had watched about the spot    Or by his master's side;    How nourished here through such long time    He knows who gave that love sublime,    And gave that strength of feeling, great    Above all human estimate.        WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.            THE SHEPHERD DOG OF    THE PYRENEES        _Traveler._ Begone, you, sir! Here, shepherd, call your dog.    _Shepherd._     Be not affrighted, madame. Poor Pierrot      Will do no harm. I know his voice is gruff,      But then, his heart is good.    _Traveler._             Well, call him, then.      I do not like his looks. He's growling now.    _Shepherd._ Madame had better drop that stick. Pierrot,      He is as good a Christian as myself      And does not like a stick.    _Traveler._                    Such a fierce look!      And such great teeth!    _Shepherd_.        Ah, bless poor Pierrot's teeth!      Good cause have I and mine to bless those teeth.      Come here, my Pierrot. Would you like to hear,      Madame, what Pierrot's teeth have done for me?    _Traveler._     Torn a gaunt wolf, I'll warrant.    _Shepherd._                           Do you see      On that high ledge a cross of wood that stands      Against the sky?    _Traveler._   Just where the cliff goes down      A hundred fathoms sheer, a wall of rock      To where the river foams along its bed?      I've often wondered who was brave to plant      A cross on such an edge.    _Shepherd._                       Myself, madame,      That the good God might know I gave him thanks.      One night, it was November, black and thick,      The fog came down, when as I reached my house      Marie came running out; our little one,      Our four year Louis, so she cried, was lost.      I called Pierrot: \"Go, seek him, find my boy,\"      And off he went. Marie ran crying loud      To call the neighbors. They and I, we searched      All that dark night. I called Pierrot in vain;      Whistled and called, and listened for his voice;      He always came or barked at my first word,      But now, he answered not. When day at last      Broke, and the gray fog lifted, there I saw      On that high ledge, against the dawning light.      My little one asleep, sitting so near      That edge that as I looked his red barette      Fell from his nodding head down the abyss.      And there, behind him, crouched Pierrot; his teeth,      His good, strong teeth, clenching the jacket brown,      Holding the child in safety. With wild bounds      Swift as the gray wolf's own I climbed the steep,      And as I reached them Pierrot beat his tail,      And looked at me, so utterly distressed,      With eyes that said: \"Forgive, I could not speak,\"      But never loosed his hold till my dear rogue      Was safe within my arms.                      Ah, ha, Pierrot,      Madame forgives your barking and your teeth;      I knew she would.    _Traveler._           Come here, Pierrot, good dog,      Come here, poor fellow, faithful friend and true,      Come, come, be friends with me.        ELLEN MURRAY.            THE DOG UNDER THE WAGON        \"Come, wife,\" said good old farmer Gray,    \"Put on your things, 'tis market day,    And we'll be off to the nearest town,    There and back ere the sun goes down.    Spot? No, we'll leave old Spot behind,\"    But Spot he barked and Spot he whined,    And soon made up his doggish mind                To follow under the wagon.      Away they went at a good round pace    And joy came into the farmer's face,    \"Poor Spot,\" said he, \"did want to come,    But I'm awful glad he's left at home--    He'll guard the barn, and guard the cot,    And keep the cattle out of the lot.\"    \"I'm not so sure of that,\" thought Spot,                The dog under the wagon.      The farmer all his produce sold    And got his pay in yellow gold:    Home through the lonely forest. Hark!    A robber springs from behind a tree;    \"Your money or else your life,\" says he;    The moon was up, but he didn't see                The dog under the wagon.      Spot ne'er barked and Spot ne'er whined    But quickly caught the thief behind;    He dragged him down in the mire and dirt,    And tore his coat and tore his shirt,    Then held him fast on the miry ground;    The robber uttered not a sound,    While his hands and feet the farmer bound,                And tumbled him into the wagon.      So Spot he saved the farmer's life,    The farmer's money, the farmer's wife,    And now a hero grand and gay,    A silver collar he wears today;    Among his friends, among his foes--    And everywhere his master goes--    He follows on his horny toes,                The dog under the wagon.

And now I loathe and hate the hole    In thee, I do, I trow, sir.      I sallied out to see my Sal,    Across yon round hill's brow, sir;    I didn't know she, charming gal,    Had a dog,--a trouser-browser.      I'd sauntered in quite trim and spruce,    When on a sudden, oh, my trouser,    I felt thee seized where thou'rt most loose,--    I tarried there with Towser.      I on the fence, he down below,    And thou the copula, my trouser,    I thought he never would let go,--    This gentle Towser.      They say that fashion cuts thee loose,    But not so fashioned is Sal's Towser;    Thou gavest away at last, no use    To tarry, teared trouser.      Miss Sarah, she is wondrous sweet,    And I'd have once loved to espouse her,    But my calling trouser has no seat,--    I left it there with Towser.      So all unseated is my suit;    I must eschew Miss Sarah now, sir;    He's chewed my trouser; 'twouldn't suit    Me to meet Towser.        ANONYMOUS.            ROVER IN CHURCH        'Twas a Sunday morning in early May,    A beautiful, sunny, quiet day,    And all the village, old and young,    Had trooped to church when the church bell rung.    The windows were open, and breezes sweet    Fluttered the hymn books from seat to seat.    Even the birds in the pale-leaved birch    Sang as softly as if in church!      Right in the midst of the minister's prayer    There came a knock at the door. \"Who's there,    I wonder?\" the gray-haired sexton thought,    As his careful ear the tapping caught.    Rap-rap, rap-rap--a louder sound,    The boys on the back seats turned around.    What could it mean? for never before    Had any one knocked at the old church door.      Again the tapping, and now so loud,    The minister paused (though his head was bowed).    Rappety-rap! This will never do,    The girls are peeping, and laughing too!    So the sexton tripped o'er the creaking floor,    Lifted the latch and opened the door.      In there trotted a big black dog,    As big as a bear! With a solemn jog    Right up the centre aisle he pattered;    People might stare, it little mattered.    Straight he went to a little maid,    Who blushed and hid, as though afraid,    And there sat down, as if to say,    \"I'm sorry that I was late today,    But better late than never, you know;    Beside, I waited an hour or so,    And couldn't get them to open the door    Till I wagged my tail and bumped the floor.    Now little mistress, I'm going to stay,    And hear what the minister has to say.\"      The poor little girl hid her face and cried!    But the big dog nestled close to her side,    And kissed her, dog fashion, tenderly,    Wondering what the matter could be!    The dog being large (and the sexton small),    He sat through the sermon, and heard it all,    As solemn and wise as any one there,    With a very dignified, scholarly air!    And instead of scolding, the minister said,    As he laid his hand on the sweet child's head,    After the service, \"I never knew    Two better list'ners than Rover and you!\"        JAMES BUCKHAM.
