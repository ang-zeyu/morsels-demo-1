The latter, indeed, seemed fond of  being teased on the subject, as old bachelors are apt to be; and he took  occasion to inform me, in an under-tone, that the lady in question was a  prodigiously fine woman, and drove her own curricle.    [Illustration]    The dinner-time passed away in this flow of innocent hilarity; and,  though the old hall may have resounded in its time with many a scene of  broader rout and revel, yet I doubt whether it ever witnessed more  honest and genuine enjoyment. How easy it is for one benevolent being to  diffuse pleasure around him; and how truly is a kind heart a fountain of  gladness, making everything in its vicinity to freshen into smiles! the  joyous disposition of the worthy Squire was perfectly contagious; he was  happy himself, and disposed to make all the world happy; and the little  eccentricities of his humour did but season, in a manner, the sweetness  of his philanthropy.    [Illustration]    When the ladies had retired, the conversation, as usual, became still  more animated; many good things were broached which had been thought of  during dinner, but which would not exactly do for a lady's ear; and  though I cannot positively affirm that there was much wit uttered, yet I  have certainly heard many contests of rare wit produce much less  laughter. Wit, after all, is a mighty tart, pungent ingredient, and much  too acid for some stomachs; but honest good humour is the oil and wine  of a merry meeting, and there is no jovial companionship equal to that  where the jokes are rather small, and the laughter abundant. The Squire  told several long stories of early college pranks and adventures, in  some of which the parson had been a sharer; though in looking at the  latter, it required some effort of imagination to figure such a little  dark anatomy of a man into the perpetrator of a madcap gambol. Indeed,  the two college chums presented pictures of what men may be made by  their different lots in life. The Squire had left the university to live  lustily on his paternal domains, in the vigorous enjoyment of  prosperity and sunshine, and had flourished on to a hearty and florid  old age; whilst the poor parson, on the contrary, had dried and withered  away, among dusty tomes, in the silence and shadows of his study. Still  there seemed to be a spark of almost extinguished fire, feebly  glimmering in the bottom of his soul; and as the Squire hinted at a sly  story of the parson and a pretty milkmaid, whom they once met on the  banks of the Isis, the old gentleman made an \"alphabet of faces,\" which,  as far as I could decipher his physiognomy, I verily believe was  indicative of laughter;--indeed, I have rarely met with an old  gentleman who took absolutely offence at the imputed gallantries of his  youth.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    I found the tide of wine and wassail fast gaining on the dry land of  sober judgment. The company grew merrier and louder as their jokes grew  duller. Master Simon was in as chirping a humour as a grasshopper filled  with dew; his old songs grew of a warmer complexion, and he began to  talk maudlin about the widow. He even gave a long song about the wooing  of a widow, which he informed me he had gathered from an excellent  black-letter work, entitled \"Cupid's Solicitor for Love,\" containing  store of good advice for bachelors, and which he promised to lend me.  The first verse was to this effect:--              He that will woo a widow must not dally,              He must make hay while the sun doth shine;            He must not stand with her, Shall I, Shall I?              But boldly say, Widow, thou must be mine.    This song inspired the fat-headed old gentleman, who made several  attempts to tell a rather broad story out of Joe Miller, that was pat to  the purpose; but he always stuck in the middle, everybody recollecting  the latter part excepting himself. The parson, too, began to show the  effects of good cheer, having gradually settled down into a doze, and  his wig sitting most suspiciously on one side. Just at this juncture we  were summoned to the drawing-room, and, I suspect, at the private  instigation of mine host, whose joviality seemed always tempered with a  proper love of decorum.    [Illustration]    After the dinner-table was removed, the hall was given up to the younger  members of the family, who, prompted to all kind of noisy mirth by the  Oxonian and Master Simon, made its old walls ring with their merriment,  as they played at romping games. I delight in witnessing the gambols of  children, and particularly at this happy holiday-season, and could not  help stealing out of the drawing-room on hearing one of their peals of  laughter. I found them at the game of blind-man's buff. Master Simon,  who was the leader of their revels, and seemed on all occasions to  fulfil the office of that ancient potentate, the Lord of Misrule,[N] was  blinded in the midst of the hall. The little beings were as busy about  him as the mock fairies about Falstaff; pinching him, plucking at the  skirts of his coat, and tickling him with straws. One fine blue-eyed  girl of about thirteen, with her flaxen hair all in beautiful confusion,  her frolic face in a glow, her frock half torn off her shoulders, a  complete picture of a romp, was the chief tormentor; and from the  slyness with which Master Simon avoided the smaller game, and hemmed  this wild little nymph in corners, and obliged her to jump shrieking  over chairs, I suspected the rogue of being not a whit more blinded  than was convenient.    [Illustration]    When I returned to the drawing-room, I found the company seated round  the fire, listening to the parson, who was deeply ensconced in a  high-backed oaken chair, the work of some cunning artificer of yore,  which had been brought from the library for his particular  accommodation. From this venerable piece of furniture, with which his  shadowy figure and dark weazen face so admirably accorded, he was  dealing forth strange accounts of the popular superstitions and legends  of the surrounding country, with which he had become acquainted in the  course of his antiquarian researches. I am half inclined to think that  the old gentleman was himself somewhat tinctured with superstition, as  men are very apt to be who live a recluse and studious life in a  sequestered part of the country, and pore over black-letter tracts, so  often filled with the marvellous and supernatural. He gave us several  anecdotes of the fancies of the neighbouring peasantry, concerning the  effigy of the crusader which lay on the tomb by the church altar. As it  was the only monument of the kind in that part of the country, it had  always been regarded with feelings of superstition by the good wives of  the village. It was said to get up from the tomb and walk the rounds of  the churchyard in stormy nights, particularly when it thundered; and one  old woman, whose cottage bordered on the churchyard, had seen it,  through the windows of the church, when the moon shone, slowly pacing up  and down the aisles. It was the belief that some wrong had been left  unredressed by the deceased, or some treasure hidden, which kept the  spirit in a state of trouble and restlessness. Some talked of gold and  jewels buried in the tomb, over which the spectre kept watch; and there  was a story current of a sexton in old times who endeavoured to break  his way to the coffin at night; but just as he reached it, received a  violent blow from the marble hand of the effigy, which stretched him  senseless on the pavement. These tales were often laughed at by some of  the sturdier among the rustics, yet when night came on, there were many  of the stoutest unbelievers that were shy of venturing alone in the  footpath that led across the churchyard.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    From these and other anecdotes that followed, the crusader appeared to  be the favourite hero of ghost stories throughout the vicinity. His  picture, which hung up in the hall, was thought by the servants to have  something supernatural about it; for they remarked that, in whatever  part of the hall you went, the eyes of the warrior were still fixed on  you. The old porter's wife, too, at the lodge, who had been born and  brought up in the family, and was a great gossip among the  maid-servants, affirmed, that in her young days she had often heard say,  that on Midsummer eve, when it is well known all kinds of ghosts,  goblins, and fairies become visible and walk abroad, the crusader used  to mount his horse, come down from his picture, ride about the house,  down the avenue, and so to the church to visit the tomb; on which  occasion the church-door most civilly swung open of itself: not that he  needed it; for he rode through closed gates and even stone walls, and  had been seen by one of the dairymaids to pass between two bars of the  great park gate, making himself as thin as a sheet of paper.    All these superstitions I found had been very much countenanced by the  Squire, who, though not superstitious himself, was very fond of seeing  others so. He listened to every goblin tale of the neighbouring gossips  with infinite gravity, and held the porter's wife in high favour on  account of her talent for the marvellous. He was himself a great reader  of old legends and romances, and often lamented that he could not  believe in them; for a superstitious person, he thought, must live in a  kind of fairyland.    Whilst we were all attention to the parson's stories, our ears were  suddenly assailed by a burst of heterogeneous sounds from the hall, in  which was mingled something like the clang of rude minstrelsy, with the  uproar of many small voices and girlish laughter. The door suddenly flew  open, and a train came trooping into the room, that might almost have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2066"],[0,"Wildfire (#11)"],[1,"a  bell on Nagger. A bell might frighten lions that had never heard one.  Then he built a fire and cooked his meal.    It had been long since he had camped high up among the pines. The sough  of the wind pleased him, like music. There had begun to be prospects of  pleasant experience along with the toil of chasing Wildfire. He was  entering new and strange and beautiful country. How far might the chase  take him? He did not care. He was not sleepy, but even if he had been  it developed that he must wait till the coyotes ceased their barking  round his camp-fire. They came so close that he saw their gray shadows  in the gloom. But presently they wearied of yelping at him and went  away. After that the silence, broken only by the wind as it roared and  lulled, seemed beautiful to Slone. He lost completely that sense of  vague regret which had remained with him, and he forgot the Stewarts.  And suddenly he felt absolutely free, alone, with nothing behind to  remember, with wild, thrilling, nameless life before him. Just then the  long mourn of a timber wolf wailed in with the wind. Seldom had he  heard the cry of one of those night wanderers. There was nothing like  it--no sound like it to fix in the lone camper's heart the great  solitude and the wild.        CHAPTER V    In the early morning when all was gray and the big, dark pines were  shadowy specters, Slone was awakened by the cold. His hands were so  numb that he had difficulty starting a fire. He stood over the blaze,  warming them. The air was nipping, clear and thin, and sweet with  frosty fragrance.    Daylight came while he was in the midst of his morning meal. A white  frost covered the ground and crackled under his feet as he went out to  bring in the horses. He saw fresh deer tracks. Then he went back to  camp for his rifle. Keeping a sharp lookout for game, he continued his  search for the horses.    The forest was open and park-like. There were no fallen trees or  evidences of fire. Presently he came to a wide glade in the midst of  which Nagger and the pack-mustang were grazing with a herd of deer. The  size of the latter amazed Slone. The deer he had hunted back on the  Sevier range were much smaller than these. Evidently these were mule  deer, closely allied to the elk. They were so tame they stood facing  him curiously, with long ears erect. It was sheer murder to kill a deer  standing and watching like that, but Slone was out of meat and hungry  and facing a long, hard trip. He shot a buck, which leaped  spasmodically away, trying to follow the herd, and fell at the edge of  the glade. Slone cut out a haunch, and then, catching the horses, he  returned to camp, where he packed and saddled, and at once rode out on  the dim trail.    The wildness of the country he was entering was evident in the fact  that as he passed the glade where he had shot the deer a few minutes  before, there were coyotes quarreling over the carcass.    Stone could see ahead and on each side several hundred yards, and  presently he ascertained that the forest floor was not so level as he  had supposed. He had entered a valley or was traversing a wide, gently  sloping pass. He went through thickets of juniper, and had to go around  clumps of quaking aspen. The pines grew larger and farther apart.  Cedars and pinyons had been left behind, and he had met with no silver  spruces after leaving camp. Probably that point was the height of a  divide. There were banks of snow in some of the hollows on the north  side. Evidently the snow had very recently melted, and it was evident  also that the depth of snow through here had been fully ten feet,  judging from the mutilation of the juniper-trees where the deer,  standing on the hard, frozen crust, had browsed upon the branches.    The quiet of the forest thrilled Slone. And the only movement was the  occasional gray flash of a deer or coyote across a glade. No birds of  any species crossed Stone's sight. He came, presently, upon a lion  track in the trail, made probably a day before. Slone grew curious  about it, seeing how it held, as he was holding, to Wildfire's tracks.  After a mile or so he made sure the lion had been trailing the  stallion, and for a second he felt a cold contraction of his heart.  Already he loved Wildfire, and by virtue of all this toil of travel  considered the wild horse his property.    \"No lion could ever get close to Wildfire,\" he soliloquized, with a  short laugh. Of that he was absolutely certain.    The sun rose, melting the frost, and a breath of warm air, laden with  the scent of pine, moved heavily under the huge, yellow trees. Slone  passed a point where the remains of an old camp-fire and a pile of deer  antlers were further proof that Indians visited this plateau to hunt.  From this camp broader, more deeply defined trails led away to the  south and east. Slone kept to the east trail, in which Wildfire's  tracks and those of the lion showed clearly. It was about the middle of  the forenoon when the tracks of the stallion and lion left the trail to  lead up a little draw where grass grew thick. Slone followed, reading  the signs of Wildfire's progress, and the action of his pursuer, as  well as if he had seen them. Here the stallion had plowed into a  snow-bank, eating a hole two feet deep; then he had grazed around a  little; then on and on; there his splendid tracks were deep in the soft  earth. Slone knew what to expect when the track of the lion veered from  those of the horse, and he followed the lion tracks. The ground was  soft from the late melting of snow, and Nagger sunk deep. The lion left  a plain track. Here he stole steadily along; there he left many tracks  at a point where he might have halted to make sure of his scent. He was  circling on the trail of the stallion, with cunning intent of ambush.  The end of this slow, careful stalk of the lion, as told in his tracks,  came upon the edge of a knoll where he had crouched to watch and wait.    From this perch he had made a magnificent spring--Slone estimating it  to be forty feet--but he had missed the stallion. There were Wildfire's  tracks again, slow and short, and then deep and sharp where in the  impetus of fright he had sprung out of reach. A second leap of the  lion, and then lessening bounds, and finally an abrupt turn from  Wildfire's trail told the futility of that stalk. Slone made certain  that Wildfire was so keen that as he grazed along he had kept to open  ground.    Wildfire had run for a mile, then slowed down to a trot, and he had  circled to get back to the trail he had left. Slone believed the horse  was just so intelligent. At any rate, Wildfire struck the trail again,  and turned at right angles to follow it.    Here the forest floor appeared perfectly level. Patches of snow became  frequent, and larger as Slone went on. At length the patches closed up,  and soon extended as far as he could see. It was soft, affording  difficult travel. Slone crossed hundreds of deer tracks, and the trail  he was on eventually became a deer runway.    Presently, far down one of the aisles between the great pines Slone saw  what appeared to be a yellow cliff, far away. It puzzled him. And as he  went on he received the impression that the forest dropped out of sight  ahead. Then the trees grew thicker, obstructing his view. Presently the  trail became soggy and he had to help his horse. The mustang floundered  in the soft snow and earth. Cedars and pinyons appeared again, making  travel still more laborious.    All at once there came to Slone a strange consciousness of light and  wind and space and void. On the instant his horse halted with a snort.  Slone quickly looked up. Had he come to the end of the world? An abyss,  a canyon, yawned beneath him, beyond all comparison in its greatness.  His keen eye, educated to desert distance and dimension, swept down and  across, taking in the tremendous truth, before it staggered his  comprehension. But a second sweeping glance, slower, becoming  intoxicated with what it beheld, saw gigantic cliff-steps and yellow  slopes dotted with cedars, leading down to clefts filled with purple  smoke, and these led on and on to a ragged red world of rock, bare,  shining, bold, uplifted in mesa, dome, peak, and crag, clear and  strange in the morning light, still and sleeping like death.    This, then, was the great canyon, which had seemed like a hunter's  fable rather than truth. Slone's sight dimmed, blurring the spectacle,  and he found that his eyes had filled with tears. He wiped them away  and looked again and again, until he was confounded by the vastness and  the grandeur and the vague sadness of the scene. Nothing he had ever  looked at had affected him like this canyon, although the Stewarts had  tried to prepare him for it.    It was the horse-hunter's passion that reminded him of his pursuit. The  deer trail led down through a break in the wall. Only a few rods of it  could be seen. This trail was passable, even though choked with snow.  But the depth beyond this wall seemed to fascinate Slone and hold him  back, used as he was to desert trails. Then the clean mark of  Wildfire's hoof brought back the old thrill.    \"This place fits you, Wildfire,\" muttered Slone, dismounting.    He started down, leading Nagger. The mustang followed. Slone kept to  the wall side of the trail, fearing the horses might slip. The snow  held firmly at first and Slone had no trouble. The gap in the rim-rock  widened to a slope thickly grown over with cedars and pinyons and  manzanita. This growth made the descent more laborious, yet afforded  means at least for Slone to go down with less danger. There was no  stopping. Once started, the horses had to keep on. Slone saw the  impossibility of ever climbing out while that snow was there. The trail  zigzagged down and down. Very soon the yellow wall hung tremendously  over him, straight up. The snow became thinner and softer. The horses  began to"]]]
