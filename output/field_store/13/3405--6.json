The last-named functionary of course  corresponded to the Sovereign of Great Britain. He was appointed by the  Crown, to whom he was solely responsible. He was in no constitutional  sense responsible to either branch of the Legislature, or to both  branches combined, or to any other cis-Atlantic authority whatsoever.    With such substitutes for King, Lords and Commons, Upper Canada might  therefore be said to possess a pretty close copy of the British  constitution. But when carried into practice the resemblance failed in a  matter of the very highest import. The absence of ministerial  responsibility was an all-comprehending divergence. When a British  ministry fails to command the confidence of the electorate, as  represented by the House of Commons, resignation must follow. In other  words, the Government of the day derives its power from the people, to  whom it is responsible for the manner in which it discharges the trust  reposed in it; and the moment it fails to command public confidence it  must give way to those who possess such confidence. The test of  confidence is the vote in the House of Commons. This has been a  recognized principle of English Parliamentary Government for nearly two  hundred years; in fact, ever since the settlement of the constitution  after the Revolution of 1688. With us in Upper Canada there was none of  this ministerial responsibility. We had a ministry, but not a  responsible ministry. It was manifestly impossible that each member of  the Legislative Council and Assembly should be consulted as to every  minute detail of the administration. Such a system would be cumbrous,  and altogether impracticable. The actual task of carrying on the  Government was therefore, as in England, entrusted to a small body of  men who, from the nature of their functions, were known as the Executive  Council. The members of this body were appointed by the Crown--that is  to say, by the Lieutenant-Governor--at will. It was not necessary that  they should have seats in either branch of the Legislature, to neither  of which were they in any sense responsible. They were not required to  possess any property or other qualification. In a word, the Crown's  representative was at liberty to select them without any restriction,  and no one in the Province would have had any constitutional right to  call him to account if he had seen fit to enrol his own valet as an  Executive Councillor. As matter of fact they were commonly selected from  the judiciary and other salaried officials, and from the members of the  Legislative Council. Their number was indeterminate, but was seldom less  than four or more than six, in addition to the Lieutenant-Governor  himself. Their functions consisted of giving advice to the  Lieutenant-Governor on all matters of governmental policy, whenever he  might deem it expedient to consult them. With respect to mere matters of  detail, such as appointments to office, he was not supposed to be under  the necessity of advising with them, nor, according to an opinion long  and ostentatiously proclaimed, was he in these early days under the  smallest obligation to follow their advice after it had been given.  This, however, was merely the prescriptive view, and it derived no  sanction from the Constitutional Act itself, which incidentally refers  to the Executive Council as being appointed \"within such Province, for  the affairs thereof.\" On the other hand, the Executive Councillors  themselves were not legally or constitutionally responsible to the Upper  Canadian people, either individually or collectively, for any line of  policy they might inculcate, or for any advice they might give. There  were no means whereby they could be called to account by the people,  even should they corruptly and openly abuse the trust reposed in them.    It is not difficult to foresee the result of so anomalous a state of  things, though in this Province, owing to sparsity of population and  other local causes, the result did not immediately become apparent.  Simcoe was a strong-minded, as well as a conscientious man. He had a  policy of his own for the government of the country, both at large and  in detail, and during his _regime_ he carried out that policy as to him  seemed best. He from time to time went through the form of consulting  with his Executive Council, but, so far from receiving any impulse from  them, he invariably carried all before him at the Council Board, and was  the be-all and end-all of the Administration. He was, in short, a  beneficent despot, of high and disinterested views, who accomplished  much good for Upper Canada, and would doubtless have accomplished more  but for his too early removal. The moment his all-pervading influence  was gone, however, the mischief, as has already been seen, began to  work. President Russell granted public lands to Peter Russell, and  rapidly laid up a store of wealth. Where the head of the public service  was thus disposed to help himself, we may be sure that subordinate  officials were not slow to follow his example. Subsequent  Lieutenant-Governors were for the most part military men, with little  knowledge of the country's needs, and with a disposition to make their  voluntary exile as easy and agreeable--and withal as profitable--as  might be.[27] They naturally turned for counsel and assistance to their  Executive Councillors, who thus became the dispensers of patronage and  the supreme power in the State. The Crown's representative was a mere  tool in their hands. Their domination was complete. \"A body of holders  of office thus constituted,\" says Lord Durham,[28] \"without reference to  the people or their representatives, must in fact, from the very nature  of colonial government, acquire the entire direction of the affairs of  the Province. A Governor, arriving in a colony in which he almost  invariably has had no previous acquaintance with the state of parties or  the character of individuals, is compelled to throw himself almost  entirely upon those whom he finds placed in the position of his official  advisers. His first acts must necessarily be performed, and his first  appointments made, at their suggestion. And as these first acts and  appointments give a character to his policy, he is generally brought  thereby into immediate collision with the other parties in the country,  and thrown into more complete dependence upon the official party and its  friends.\"    It has been the fashion with most writers on our early history to  represent the Executive Council as an arbitrary creation of the early  Lieutenant-Governors: as an arrangement sanctioned by the Imperial  authorities, but not authorized by the Provincial constitution. Such  writers cannot have read the debates which took place in the House of  Commons while the Constitutional Act of 1791 was under discussion there.  Nay, they cannot have read the Act itself with much care. Nothing is  more certain than that the framers of that statute contemplated the  creation of an Executive Council. By reference to the seventh,  thirty-fourth and thirty-eighth clauses it will be seen that the  Executive Council is definitely mentioned by name, and that the  appointment of such a body is assumed, and treated as a matter of  course. But that the Council should occupy the same relative position as  in Great Britain, and that it should be amenable to public opinion as  expressed by the vote of the House of Assembly, does not appear to have  been clearly understood. Indeed, with the exception of a few master  minds, such as Pitt, Fox, and Burke, but little interest seems to have  been taken by British legislators in this important colonial experiment.  Parliamentary Government, though it had been long established in  England, had not then been reduced to a science. Even such clear-sighted  statesmen as Pitt and Fox were blind to facts which at the present day  force themselves upon the attention of every student of constitutional  history. What wonder, then, that there should have been defects in the  measure of 1791? What wonder that even eminent statesmen should have  attempted to square the circle in politics by introducing such an  incongruity as representative institutions without Executive  responsibility? Power was given to the popular branch of the Legislature  to pass measures for the public good. But, no matter how overwhelming  might be the majorities whereby such measures were passed, there was no  obligation on the other branches of the Legislature to accept or act  upon them. In the words of one of our own writers: \"the Legislative  Councils, nominated by the Crown, held the Legislative Assemblies by the  throat, kept them prostrate, and paralyzed them.\"[29] As for the members  of the Executive Council, they were to all intents and purposes  independent of public opinion, and could override a unanimous vote of  the Assembly without incurring any responsibility whatever. By reference  to the correspondence between successive colonial Governors and the Home  Office, it appears to have been tacitly recognized by the magnates on  both sides of the Atlantic that it was unnecessary for a colonial  Executive to defer to a Parliamentary majority. The right of appointment  to office was considered to be the exclusive prerogative of the  representative of the Sovereign, and it was regarded as a badge of  colonial dependence that the people should have no voice in such  matters.    It seems to have been assumed that certain Imperial interests were  involved in this great question, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22136"],[0,"The Book-Hunter (#11)"],[1,"the  corridor or by a lancet-window or a loophole. The floors were of  polished oak or deal; the ceilings of stone or whitewashed; and as to  the walls, you could see nothing of them for the panelling of shelves  and the backs of the volumes. It was books--books--books--everywhere;  the brilliant modern binding of recent works relieving the dull and far  more appropriate tints of work-worn leather and time-stained vellum. To  the visitor it seemed confusion worse confounded; though wherever his  glance happened to fall, he had assurance of the treasures heaped at  random around him. But his host carried the clue to the labyrinth in his  brain, and could lay his hand on the spur of the moment on the book he  happened to want. And with the wonders he had to offer for your  admiration, you forgot the flight of time, till you woke up from your  abstraction in the enchanted library, to inquire about the manuscript  that was in course of publication.\"    In spring Dr Burton generally spent some time in London, partly on  official business, partly in literary research at the British Museum.    He was elected a member of the Athenaeum Club without application or  ballot, an honour which he valued highly. He delighted in the dignified  and literary tone of the Club, and frequented it much when in London.    About 1867 the office of Historiographer-Royal becoming vacant, it was  bestowed on Dr Burton, with a salary of L190 per annum, thus bringing  his annual income to nearly L900, instead of L700. The compliment was  enhanced by the fact of a Conservative Ministry being then in office.  Dr Burton was a decided, though not aggressive, Liberal in politics.    Though personally more and more unsociable as years advanced, Dr Burton  was excessively hospitable. He could not bear that any person, rich or  poor, should leave his house unrefreshed, and he made both servants and  children welcome to see their friends if these did not trespass on his  time. A nervous inquiry in later years, if he heard of any guest being  expected, was, \"He, or she, will not meddle with me, will he?\" Assured  that the privacy of his library would be respected, any one was free to  the rest of the house; and if they showed no disposition to intrude, Dr  Burton would gradually become tame to them, and in some few instances  appear to enjoy a temporary addition to the family circle. Such  instances were, however, rare and ever rarer. He was strongly attached  to his home and home circle, and preferred having no addition to it. A  very partial parent to all his children, his sons were his special pride  and happiness.    During the first years of Craighouse, his wife was able to accompany him  in those long rambles on the Pentlands which were his favourite  amusement. Afterwards, when she was unable for the exertion, he found  pleasant companions in his sons.    Several times during those years he spent some weeks on the Continent.  He generally wrote daily during all absences, but his letters, as  already said, were for the most part brief,--chiefly craving for news  from home, which was also written for him daily. If any accident  prevented his receiving his daily letter, he expressed agonies of  apprehension about all possible or impossible ills. In regard to the  health of his family he was painfully anxious and apprehensive.    The subjoined letters are offered as specimens of his correspondence.         \"ATHENAEUM CLUB,       _29th June 1871_.         \"MY DEAR WILLIE,[13]--As you and I have often gone geologising       together, I'll tell you how I got on at St Albans, where, I suppose       you know, I saw cousin William.[14] You know the conglomerates.       They are generally hard little stones in a casing of sandstone,       lime, or other soft matter. I have known for thirty years, in a       lapidary's window in Perth, a large piece of conglomerate, where       all is hard and flinty, taking a beautiful polish. After much       inquiry I found that this was got in Hertfordshire, where St Albans       is. I could get no account of any rock of it, however. But as there       was a committee of agriculturists smoking in the inn every evening,       I joined them, and got my information.

It is called the 'Mother stone,' or the 'Breeding       stone,' from a supposition that it is the nursery of all the       flints. When its nodules grow large enough, they set up as flints       on their own account. There is therefore a great desire to       extirpate it from the fields, and it might be found by their sides,       or, as one man said, 'You may foind it anywheres, and you maint       never foind it nowheres.' So I prowled about and got plenty,       chipping off as much as I could conveniently carry.         \"Tell Tucky and Cos[15] all this.

Meanwhile I am going to give       you a little lesson in history and geography suggested by my       travels.         [Footnote 16: Dr Burton's youngest son, eleven or twelve years       old.]         \"Look at some map containing Holland. You find me land at       Rotterdam, and go round by Arnheim to Nymegen. This town used to be       strongly fortified. I rambled in the remains of the fortifications,       like small hills and valleys covered with bright grass. I saw a       quantity of fine mushrooms growing in them, and the tall yellow       flowers known as Samson's rod. The reason of the fortification is       this. The Hollanders were an industrious, frugal people, who made a       fruitful country out of swamps and sand. Nymegen is in the border.       It is the gate, as it were, to Holland, and the fortifications kept       the gate shut against enemies.         \"In the year 1704 there reigned in France Louis XIV., called Louis       the Grand. He had greatly enlarged his dominions, taking one       country after another. He possessed the whole between Holland and       France, and now he was to besiege Nymegen and take Holland. The       Hollanders said to the British: 'We have been good friends; you are       strong. Surely you will not let this cruel king rob us of the       fruits of our industry? Besides, if Louis takes one country after       another he will be so strong that you will not be able to resist       him--it is your interest as well as ours. Come and help us in our       sore distress.'         \"So Queen Anne sent over an army under Marlborough. Not only did he       save Nymegen, but he took from King Louis the chief fortified town       he had in the neighbourhood--Venlo,--and many others along the       river Maas or Meuse. There was an alliance with the Germans, and       when King Louis heard that a German army was going to join the       British he said, 'Together they will be too strong for me, let us       destroy the German army in the first place.' For this purpose he       sent an army to the Danube.         \"For reasons I may tell you afterwards, all great battles are       fought on flat ground. Marlborough thought that if he could get his       army over the hills and into the plains of the Danube, he could       fight the French before they destroyed the Germans. Accordingly he       crossed what is called the 'watershed' between the Rhine and the       Danube. You will find it at Geislingen, between Heidelberg and       here. There is always high ground, and generally a valley in it at       the sources of streams running in different directions. You may see       this in the Pentlands, where the burns on one side run into the       Water of Leith, and those on the other into the Esk.\"    The end of this letter has unfortunately been lost.    The fragment above quoted serves to illustrate Dr Burton's strong  interest in military history. His accounts of battles and battle-fields  are allowed to be the most striking parts of his Histories. His interest  in such subjects arose partly from the faint infantile recollections  already described. He purchased and studied works on fortification and  military strategy.         \"ATHENAEUM CLUB, PALL MALL, S.W.,       _25th April 1877_.         \"MY DEAR LOVE,[17]--I got this morning your letter of Tuesday; very       pleasant and refreshing, and more than once read over.
