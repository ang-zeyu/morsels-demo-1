Montaigne was too intensely an egotist, in his character as man no less  than in his character as writer, to have many personal relations that  exhibit him in aspects engaging to our love. But one friendship of his  is memorable,--is even historic. The name of La Boetie is forever  associated with the name of Montaigne. La Boetie is remarkable for  being, as we suppose, absolutely the first voice raised in France  against the idea of monarchy. His little treatise \"Contr' Un\"  (literally, \"Against One\"), or \"Voluntary Servitude,\" is by many  esteemed among the most important literary productions of modern times.  Others, again, Mr. George Saintsbury for example, consider it an  absurdly overrated book. For our own part, we are inclined to give it  conspicuous place in the history of free thought in France. La Boetie  died young; and his \"Contr' Un\" was published posthumously,--first by  the Protestants, after the terrible day of St. Bartholomew. Our readers  may judge for themselves whether a pamphlet in which such passages as  the following could occur, must not have had an historic effect upon the  inflammable sentiment of the French people. We take Mr. Bayle St.  John's translation, bracketing a hint or two of correction suggested by  comparison of the original French. The treatise of La Boetie is  sometimes now printed with Montaigne's \"Essays,\" in French editions of  our author's works: La Boetie says:--         You sow your fruits [crops] that he [the king] may ravage them; you       furnish and fill your houses that he may have something to steal;       you bring up your daughters that he may slake his luxury; you bring       up your sons that he may take them to be butchered in his wars, to       be the ministers of his avarice, the executors of his vengeance;       you disfigure your forms by labor [your own selves you inure to       toil] that he may cocker himself in delight, and wallow in nasty       and disgusting pleasure.    Montaigne seems really to have loved this friend of his, whom he  reckoned the greatest man in France. His account of La Boetie's death is  boldly, and not presumptuously, paralleled by Mr. St. John with the  \"Phaedon\" of Plato. Noble writing, it certainly is, though its  stateliness is a shade too self-conscious, perhaps.    We have thus far presented Montaigne in words of his own such as may  fairly be supposed likely to prepossess the reader in his favor. We  could multiply our extracts indefinitely in a like unexceptionable vein  of writing. But to do so, and to stop with these, would misrepresent  Montaigne. Montaigne is very far from being an innocent writer. His  moral tone generally is low, and often it is execrable. He is coarse,  but coarseness is not the worst of him. Indeed, he is cleanliness itself  compared with Rabelais. But Rabelais is morality itself compared with  Montaigne. Montaigne is corrupt and corrupting. This feature of his  writings, we are necessarily forbidden to illustrate. In an essay  written in his old age,--which we will not even name, its general tenor  is so evil,--Montaigne holds the following language:--         I gently turn aside, and avert my eyes from the stormy and cloudy       sky I have before me, which, thanks be to God, I regard without       fear, but not without meditation and study, and amuse myself in the       remembrance of my better years:--         \"Animus quod perdidit, optat, Atque in praeterita se totus imagine       versat.\"           PETRONIUS, c. 128.         [\"The mind desires what it has lost, and in fancy flings itself       wholly into the past.\"]         Let childhood look forward, and age backward: is not this the       signification of Janus' double face? Let years haul me along if       they will, but it shall be backward; as long as my eyes can discern       the pleasant season expired, I shall now and then turn them that       way; though it escape from my blood and veins, I shall not,       however, root the image of it out of my memory:--         \"Hoc est Vivere bis, vita posse priore frui.\"           MARTIAL, x. 23, 7.         [\"'Tis to live twice to be able to enjoy former life again.\"]    Harmlessly, even engagingly, pensive seems the foregoing strain of  sentiment. Who could suppose it a prelude to detailed reminiscence on  the author's part of sensual pleasures--the basest--enjoyed in the past?  The venerable voluptuary keeps himself in countenance for his lascivious  vein, by writing as follows:--         I have enjoined myself to dare to say all that I dare to do; even       thoughts that are not to be published, displease me; the worst of       my actions and qualities do not appear to me so evil, as I find it       evil and base not to dare to own them....         ...I am greedy of making myself known, and I care not to how many,       provided it be truly.... Many things that I would not say to a       particular individual, I say to the people; and, as to my most       secret thoughts, send my most intimate friends to my book.... For       my part, if any one should recommend me as a good pilot, as being       very modest, or very chaste, I should owe him no thanks [because       the recommendation would be false].    We must leave it--as, however, Montaigne himself is far enough from  leaving it--to the imagination of readers to conjecture what \"pleasures\"  they are, of which this worn-out debauchee (nearing death, and thanking  God that he nears it \"without fear\") speaks in the following sentimental  strain:--         In farewells, we oftener than not heat our affections towards the       things we take leave of: I take my last leave of the pleasures of       this world; these are our last embraces.    Mr. Emerson, in his \"Representative Men,\" makes Montaigne stand for The  Sceptic. Sceptic Montaigne was. He questioned, he considered, he  doubted. He stood poised in equilibrium, in indifference, between  contrary opinions. He saw reasons on this side, but he saw reasons also  on that, and he did not clear his mind. \"_Que scai-je?_\" was his motto  (\"What know I?\"), a question as of hopeless ignorance,--nay, as of  ignorance also void of desire to know. His life was one long  interrogation, a balancing of opposites, to the end.    Such, speculatively, was Montaigne. Such, too, speculatively, was  Pascal. The difference, however, was greater than the likeness, between  these two minds. Pascal, doubting, gave the world of spiritual things  the benefit of his doubt. Montaigne, on the other hand, gave the benefit  of his doubt to the world of sense. He was a sensualist, he was a  glutton, he was a lecher. He, for his portion, chose the good things of  this life. His body he used to get him pleasures of the body. In  pleasures of the body he sunk and drowned his conscience,--if he ever  had a conscience. But his intelligence survived. He became, at last,--if  he was not such from the first,--almost pure sense, without soul.    Yet we have no doubt Montaigne was an agreeable gentleman. We think we  should have got on well with him as a neighbor of ours. He was a  tolerably decent father, provided the child were grown old enough to be  company for him. His own lawful children, while infants, had to go out  of the house for their nursing; so it not unnaturally happened that all  but one died in their infancy. Five of such is the number that you can  count in his own journalistic entries of family births and deaths. But,  speaking as \"moral philosopher,\" in his \"Essays,\" he says, carelessly,  that he had lost \"two or three\" \"without repining.\" This, perhaps, is  affectation. But what affectation!    Montaigne was well-to-do; and he ranked as a gentleman, if not as a  great nobleman. He lived in a castle, bequeathed to him, and by him  bequeathed,--a castle still standing, and full of personal association  with its most famous owner. He occupied a room in the tower, fitted up  as a library. Over the door of this room may still, we believe, be read  Montaigne's motto, \"_Que scai-je?_\" Votaries of Montaigne perform their  pious pilgrimages to this shrine of their idolatry, year after year,  century after century.    For, remember, it is now three centuries since Montaigne wrote. He was  before Bacon and Shakspeare. He was contemporary with Charles IX., and  with Henry of Navarre. But date has little to do with such a writer as  Montaigne. His quality is sempiternal. He overlies the ages, as the long  hulk of \"The Great Eastern\" overlay the waves of the sea, stretching  from summit to summit. Not that, in the form of his literary work, he  was altogether independent of time and of circumstance. Not that he was  uninfluenced by his historic place, in the essential spirit of his  work. But, more than often happens, Montaigne may fairly be judged out  of himself alone. His message he might, indeed, have delivered  differently; but it would have been substantially the same message if he  had been differently placed in the world, and in history. We need  hardly, therefore, add any thing about Montaigne's outward life. His  true life is in his book.    Montaigne the Essayist is the consummate, the ideal, expression,  practically incapable of improvement, of the spirit and wisdom of the  world. This characterization, we think, fairly and sufficiently sums up  the good and the bad of Montaigne. We might seem to describe no very  mischievous thing. But to have the spirit and wisdom of this world  expressed, to have it expressed as in a last authoritative form, a form  to commend it, to flatter it, to justify it, to make it seem sufficient,  to erect it into a kind of gospel,--that means much. It means hardly  less than to provide the world with a new Bible,--a Bible of the world's  own, a Bible that shall approve itself as better than the Bible of the  Old and New Testaments. Montaigne's \"Essays\" constitute, in effect, such  a book.

The Frenchmen  won't see us till then.\"    The entrance was not very easy; as soon as we were outside the boys gave  way.  I every now and then turned my head round to ascertain if we were  observed.  The Frenchmen were most probably, as we had been, searching  for water and did not see us.  At length they caught sight of us, I  concluded, as I saw them running along the shore as fast as their legs  would carry them.  My boys exerted their arms in a like manner.  The  Frenchmen, although they saw that we were beyond their reach, fired a  shot at us.  Another and another followed.  It was done in mere  wantonness, for they could not have known who we were.  We were much too  distant from them, however, for the shot to reach us.  Heavily laden as  was our boat, the boys urged her on fast, and in a short time we were  alongside the schooner.  Charley White, who had remained in charge, had  heard the shots, and guessing who had fired them, had got the sheep on  board with the wood and grass, and made everything ready for weighing.  Happily, the breeze blew down the harbour.  We speedily hoisted the  boats on board and got the anchors up, and while the Frenchmen were  climbing up a height which formed the eastern shore of the inlet, we ran  out and were speedily clear of the land.  We could see them through the  glass stamping on the ground, apparently with rage at our having escaped  them.  The northerly breeze carried us in a short time out of their  sight and indeed out of sight of the land itself.  We were to the south  of the equator, and that northerly wind was the hottest I ever  experienced; from its very smell we could tell that it had blown over  many hundred miles of burnt earth or dry sand.  We kept south; for I  purposed going round Van Diemen's Land instead of through Bass's  Straits--not then very well known.    Next day we looked out with some anxiety for the Frenchman, but he was  nowhere to be seen, and we entertained the hope that we had escaped him  altogether.    We sighted the southern part of Van Diemen's Land.  But as we should not  have been allowed to land at the new settlement then even had we wished  it, unless we had put in there in distress, we continued our course for  Port Jackson.  It was time for us to be in port.  We had eaten up all  the fowls except those we wanted to land; the biscuits were becoming  mouldy, the water bad, the hay was nearly consumed, and the sheep, put  on short allowance, were looking thin, though otherwise healthy.    The lads were continually going to the mast-head, each one eager to be  the first to discover land.    We were edging in for the coast, from which I knew that we were not far  distant, when Mark, who was aloft, shouted out, \"Land! land!  Hurrah!  the land we are bound for!\"  I was afraid that in the exuberance of his  delight he would have let go his hold, and come down by the run on deck.  John thought so too, and with alarm expressed in his countenance, ran  under him to catch him in his arms.  He held on, however, and in a few  seconds his brother and White joined him, and shouted with almost as  much glee as he had exhibited, \"Land! land!\"  We stood in directly for  it, for by my calculations we were not far off Botany Bay, or rather  Port Jackson, for that in reality was the port for which we were bound.    In England in those days people always spoke of Botany Bay, because that  was the place where Captain Cook landed before Port Jackson was  discovered.    A strong breeze was blowing, which carried us rapidly towards the land.  The wind increased, and dark clouds were seen gathering in the  south-east.  I had heard of a black squall off that coast, and from the  darkness of the sky and the increasing wind, I was afraid that one was  now brewing.  Charley White was of my opinion, I found.  This made me  more than ever anxious to get into harbour before dark.  Still it  increased the danger of approaching the shore, and the bay afforded no  shelter to the wind then blowing.  We flew rapidly on; the dim outline  of the coast became more and more distinct.  At length we could  distinguish some lofty headlands directly ahead.    Charley White knew that two such headlands mark the entrance to Port  Jackson, but he reminded me that there is a third, which forms the side  of False Bay, and that more than one ship had run in there, and that  instead of finding a sheltering harbour they had been thrown against the  rugged cliffs which form its sides.    The knowledge of this increased my anxiety.  The sky in the east became  darker and darker, and the wind yet further increased, till it blew  almost a hurricane; heavy seas came rolling up, topped with white foam,  leaping in eagerness it seemed to catch the little craft which had borne  us in safety so far over the bosom of the ocean, and was about to escape  altogether from their power.    Peter stood at the helm.  Charley and I kept a keen look-out ahead.  As  we flew on, the land became more distinct, and the outline of the  headlands appeared; still darkness was coming on--a mistake would be  fatal.    \"I see the heads!\" exclaimed Charley at length.  \"There is no mistake; I  am certain of it.  Starboard a little, Peter.  That will do, she is  heading right in for the entrance.  Take the bearings now; keep her  exact on that course.  My life for it, we shall get safe into the  harbour.\"    My anxiety was lifted off my shoulders.  I had a confidence in Charley's  judgment and knowledge which I should have placed in few people, but he  had already shown me that he was to be trusted.  The darkness now came  rapidly on, and so heavy a sea got up, and so furiously blew the gale,  that I often doubted whether the little _May Flower_ would stand it.  I  doubt whether alone I could have found the entrance; but Charley never  wavered in his opinion.  Keeping his eye towards the land, now gradually  becoming shrouded in deeper and deeper gloom, he continued to direct  Peter how to steer.    After a time the land rose up close ahead of us, but there was a deep  slit in the centre, which seemed each instant to increase in width, and  then the cliffs appeared on either side.  The roar of the waves was  tremendous, deafening to our ears; but we felt them less and less, till,  rushing on, a wide, open, smooth expanse lay before us, and we were in  smooth water--the haven where we would be.        CHAPTER TEN.    OUR CONVICT HOST    Oh, the rest, the satisfaction, and, I may say, the thankfulness we  felt.  We shortened sail, and rounded to for a pilot, who came on board,  and took us up to a berth opposite to Sydney, or the camp, as it was  even then frequently called.  As soon as we had dropped our anchor and  furled sails, we one and all of us, young and old, my wife and daughters  and my boys, and White and the crew, went down on our knees and returned  thanks to the God of love and mercy who had thus brought us in safety in  our small vessel across the great ocean.  The tempest raged on without,  but we lay quiet and secure within the harbour.  I cannot describe to  you how free from care I slept that night, and yet many people would  have said that our troubles were only now going to begin.    As soon as the morning broke, all on board assembled on deck to look out  on the new world to which we had come.  The magnificent harbour, its  surrounding heights and numerous points and inlets were the same then as  now, but the ground on which the large city of Sydney now stands was  then dotted over with a few Government buildings and merchants' stores,  and here and there a large private residence, and not a few big  public-houses; but most of the dwelling-houses were of plank, and some  even of canvas, belonging to newcomers.  Still there was evidence of  progress, and as the day advanced, and people began to move about, a  good deal of animation and activity was visible.    We were soon surrounded by boats, with people eager to know where we had  come from, and what cargo we had got.  Many of the visitors were not  pleasant-looking customers, and I was in no wise inclined to encourage  them on board.  Those who did come looked with very great interest at  the sheep, and I soon found from their remarks that they considered them  of much value, and that the speculation was likely to prove a good one.    Before, however, I entered into any engagements, I went on shore to  ascertain the state of affairs.  I found that I could obtain a large  grant of land free, and that as many convicts would be assigned to me as  I could maintain, to cultivate the land.  I knew a little about farming,  and I forgot at the time that the convicts were not likely to become  very pleasant servants, so that everything to be done appeared plain and  easy before me, and in high spirits I returned on board.    My family were, of course, all eager to get on shore, but as they had no  home to go to, it was arranged that I and Charley White and John should  set out at once to select some land, while Peter remained on board to  take care of the family and look after the vessel.  We none of us knew  much about land, as to which was likely to prove good or bad, but then  we could take advantage of the experience of earlier settlers.  We could  ascertain how some had failed, and others had been successful, and  follow, with such modifications as circumstances might require, the  example of the latter.  We each carried a knapsack with provisions, and  a cloak to sleep in at night; said Charley, who was a good shot, had a  gun, that he might kill a kangaroo, or any other animal we might fall in  with, for food.  We each of us had also a pocket compass, without which  no man should attempt to travel in a new country like Australia.    My wife and daughters seemed very anxious when we were all ready and  about to set out, but I reminded them that we were only just going to do  what we had come all the way"]]]
