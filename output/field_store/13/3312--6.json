Laura Bridgman was born  a normal child, and developed as other children do up to the age of  nearly three years. At this time, through an attack of scarlet fever,  she lost her hearing completely and also the sight of her left eye. Her  right eye was so badly affected that she could see but little; and it,  too, became entirely blind when she was eight. She lived in this  condition until she was sixty years old, when she died. Professor  Donaldson submitted the cortex of her brain to a most careful  examination, also comparing the corresponding areas on the two  hemispheres with each other. He found that as a whole the cortex was  thinner than in the case of normal individuals. He found also that the  cortical area connected with the left eye--namely, the right occipital  region--was much thinner than that for the right eye, which had retained  its sight longer than the other. He says: \"It is interesting to notice  that those parts of the cortex which, according to the current view,  were associated with the defective sense organs were also particularly  thin. The cause of this thinness was found to be due, at least in part,  to the small size of the nerve cells there present. Not only were the  large and medium-sized cells smaller, but the impression made on the  observer was that they were also less numerous than in the normal  cortex.\"    EFFECT OF SENSORY STIMULI.--No doubt if we could examine the brain of a  person who has grown up in an environment rich in stimuli to the eye,  where nature, earth, and sky have presented a changing panorama of color  and form to attract the eye; where all the sounds of nature, from the  chirp of the insect to the roar of the waves and the murmur of the  breeze, and from the softest tones of the voice to the mightiest sweep  of the great orchestra, have challenged the ear; where many and varied  odors and perfumes have assailed the nostrils; where a great range of  tastes have tempted the palate; where many varieties of touch and  temperature sensations have been experienced--no doubt if we could  examine such a brain we should find the sensory areas of the cortex  excelling in thickness because its cells were well developed and full  sized from the currents which had been pouring into them from the  outside world. On the other hand, if we could examine a cortex which had  lacked any one of these stimuli, we should find some area in it  undeveloped because of this deficiency. Its owner therefore possesses  but the fraction of a brain, and would in a corresponding degree find  his mind incomplete.    NECESSITY FOR MOTOR ACTIVITY.--Likewise in the case of the motor areas.  Pity the boy or girl who has been deprived of the opportunity to use  every muscle to the fullest extent in the unrestricted plays and games  of childhood. For where such activities are not wide in their scope,  there some areas of the cortex will remain undeveloped, because unused,  and the person will be handicapped later in his life from lack of skill  in the activities depending on these centers. Halleck says in this  connection: \"If we could examine the developing motor region with a  microscope of sufficient magnifying power, it is conceivable that we  might learn wherein the modification due to exercise consists. We might  also, under such conditions, be able to say, 'This is the motor region  of a piano player; the modifications here correspond precisely to those  necessary for controlling such movements of the hand.' Or, 'This is the  motor tract of a blacksmith; this, of an engraver; and these must be the  cells which govern the vocal organs of an orator.'\" Whether or not the  microscope will ever reveal such things to us, there is no doubt that  the conditions suggested exist, and that back of every inefficient and  awkward attempt at physical control lies a motor area with its cells  undeveloped by use. No wonder that our processes of learning physical  adjustment and control are slow, for they are a growth in the brain  rather than a simple \"learning how.\"    The training of the nervous system consists finally, then, in the  development and cooerdination of the neurones of which it is composed. We  have seen that the sensory cells are to be developed by the sensory  stimuli pouring in upon them, and the motor cells by the motor impulses  which they send out to the muscles. The sensory and the motor fibers  likewise, being an outgrowth of their respective cells, find their  development in carrying the impulses which result in sensation and  movement. Thus it is seen that the neurone is, in its development as in  its work, a unit.    DEVELOPMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION CENTERS.--To this simpler type of sensory  and motor development which we have been considering, we must add that  which comes from the more complex mental processes, such as memory,  thought, and imagination. For it is in connection with these that the  association fibers are developed, and the brain areas so connected that  they can work together as a unit. A simple illustration will enable us  to see more clearly how the nervous mechanism acts to bring this about.    Suppose that I am walking along a country road deeply engaged in  meditation, and that I come to a puddle of water in my pathway. I may  turn aside and avoid the obstruction without my attention being called  to it, and without interruption of my train of thought. The act has been  automatic. In this case the nerve current has passed from the eye (_S_)  over an afferent fiber to a sensory center (_s_) in the nervous system  below the cortex; from there it has been forwarded to a motor center  (_m_) in the same region, and on out over a motor fiber to the proper  muscles (_M_), which are to execute the required act. The act having  been completed, the sensory nerves connected with the muscles employed  report the fact back that the work is done, thus completing the circuit.  This event may be taken as an illustration of literally thousands of  acts which we perform daily without the intervention of consciousness,  and hence without involving the hemispheres.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Diagram illustrating the paths of association.]    If, however, instead of avoiding the puddle unconsciously, I do so from  consideration of the danger of wet feet and the disagreeableness of  soiled shoes and the ridiculous appearance I shall make, then the  current cannot take the short circuit, but must pass on up to the  cortex. Here it awakens consciousness to take notice of the obstruction,  and calls forth the images which aid in directing the necessary  movements. This simple illustration may be greatly complicated,  substituting for it one of the more complex problems which are  continually presenting themselves to us for solution, or the associated  trains of thought that are constantly occupying our minds. But the truth  of the illustration still holds. Whether in the simple or the complex  act, there is always a forward passing of the nerve current through the  sensory and thought centers, and on out through the motor centers to the  organs which are to be concerned in the motor response.    THE FACTORS INVOLVED IN A SIMPLE ACTION.--Thus it will be seen that in  the simplest act which can be considered there are the following  factors: (1) The stimulus which acts on the end-organ; (2) the ingoing  current over an afferent nerve; (3) the sensory or interpreting cells;  (4) the fibers connecting the sensory with a motor center; (5) the motor  cells; (6) the efferent nerve to carry the direction for the movement  outward to the muscle; (7) the motor response; and, finally, (8) the  report back that the act has been performed. With this in mind it fairly  bewilders one to think of the marvelous complexity of the work that is  going on in our nervous mechanism every moment of our life, even without  considering the higher thought processes at all. How, with these added,  the resulting complexity all works out into beautiful harmony is indeed  beyond comprehension.      3. EDUCATION AND THE TRAINING OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM    Fortunately, many of the best opportunities for sensory and motor  training do not depend on schools or courses of study. The world is full  of stimuli to our senses and to our social natures; and our common lives  are made up of the responses we make to these stimuli,--the movements,  acts and deeds by which we fit ourselves into our world of environment.  Undoubtedly the most rapid and vital progress we make in our development  is accomplished in the years before we have reached the age to go to  school. Yet it is the business of education to see that we do not lack  any essential opportunity, to make sure that necessary lines of stimuli  or of motor training have not been omitted from our development.    EDUCATION TO SUPPLY OPPORTUNITIES FOR STIMULUS AND RESPONSE.--The great  problem of education is, on the physical side, it would seem, then, to  provide for ourselves and those we seek to educate as rich an  environment of sensory and social stimuli as possible; one whose  impressions will be full of suggestions to response in motor activity  and the higher thought processes; and then to give opportunity for  thought and for expression in acts and deeds in the largest possible  number of lines. And added to this must be frequent and clear sensory  and motor recall, a living over again of the sights and sounds and odors  and the motor activities we have once experienced. There must also be  the opportunity for the forming of worthy plans and ideals. For in this  way the brain centers which were concerned in the original sensation or  thought or movement are again brought into exercise, and their  development continued. Through recall and imagination we are able not  only greatly to multiply the effects of the immediate sensory and motor  stimuli which come to us, but also to improve our power of thinking by  getting a fund of material upon which the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20239"],[0,"The Ten Books on Architecture (#11)"],[1," and passing up appears in these  regions, thus making remarkably good sweating-baths. Likewise also it is  related that in ancient times the tides of heat, swelling and  overflowing from under Mt. Vesuvius, vomited forth fire from the  mountain upon the neighbouring country. Hence, what is called  \"sponge-stone\" or \"Pompeian pumice\" appears to have been reduced by  burning from another kind of stone to the condition of the kind which we  see.    3. The kind of sponge-stone taken from this region is not produced  everywhere else, but only about Aetna and among the hills of Mysia which  the Greeks call the \"Burnt District,\" and in other places of the same  peculiar nature. Seeing that in such places there are found hot springs  and warm vapour in excavations on the mountains, and that the ancients  tell us that there were once fires spreading over the fields in those  very regions, it seems to be certain that moisture has been extracted  from the tufa and earth, by the force of fire, just as it is from  limestone in kilns.    4. Therefore, when different and unlike things have been subjected to  the action of fire and thus reduced to the same condition, if after  this, while in a warm, dry state, they are suddenly saturated with  water, there is an effervescence of the heat latent in the bodies of  them all, and this makes them firmly unite and quickly assume the  property of one solid mass.    There will still be the question why Tuscany, although it abounds in hot  springs, does not furnish a powder out of which, on the same principle,  a wall can be made which will set fast under water. I have therefore  thought best to explain how this seems to be, before the question should  be raised.    5. The same kinds of soil are not found in all places and countries  alike, nor is stone found everywhere. Some soils are earthy; others  gravelly, and again pebbly; in other places the material is sandy; in a  word, the properties of the soil are as different and unlike as are the  various countries. In particular, it may be observed that sandpits are  hardly ever lacking in any place within the districts of Italy and  Tuscany which are bounded by the Apennines; whereas across the Apennines  toward the Adriatic none are found, and in Achaea and Asia Minor or, in  short, across the sea, the very term is unknown. Hence it is not in all  the places where boiling springs of hot water abound, that there is the  same combination of favourable circumstances which has been described  above. For things are produced in accordance with the will of nature;  not to suit man's pleasure, but as it were by a chance distribution.    6. Therefore, where the mountains are not earthy but consist of soft  stone, the force of the fire, passing through the fissures in the stone,  sets it afire. The soft and delicate part is burned out, while the hard  part is left. Consequently, while in Campania the burning of the earth  makes ashes, in Tuscany the combustion of the stone makes carbuncular  sand. Both are excellent in walls, but one is better to use for  buildings on land, the other for piers under salt water. The Tuscan  stone is softer in quality than tufa but harder than earth, and being  thoroughly kindled by the violent heat from below, the result is the  production in some places of the kind of sand called carbuncular.    [Illustration: TRAVERTINE QUARRIES ON THE ROMAN CAMPAGNA    1. 2. Ancient quarries. 3. A similar modern quarry.    The top of the rock shows the original ground level. The present ground  level shows the depth to which the rock has been removed.]          CHAPTER VII    STONE      1. I have now spoken of lime and sand, with their varieties and points  of excellence. Next comes the consideration of stone-quarries from which  dimension stone and supplies of rubble to be used in building are taken  and brought together. The stone in quarries is found to be of different  and unlike qualities. In some it is soft: for example, in the environs  of the city at the quarries of Grotta Rossa, Palla, Fidenae, and of the  Alban hills; in others, it is medium, as at Tivoli, at Amiternum, or Mt.  Soracte, and in quarries of this sort; in still others it is hard, as in  lava quarries. There are also numerous other kinds: for instance, in  Campania, red and black tufas; in Umbria, Picenum, and Venetia, white  tufa which can be cut with a toothed saw, like wood.    2. All these soft kinds have the advantage that they can be easily  worked as soon as they have been taken from the quarries. Under cover  they play their part well; but in open and exposed situations the frost  and rime make them crumble, and they go to pieces. On the seacoast, too,  the salt eats away and dissolves them, nor can they stand great heat  either. But travertine and all stone of that class can stand injury  whether from a heavy load laid upon it or from the weather; exposure to  fire, however, it cannot bear, but splits and cracks to pieces at once.  This is because in its natural composition there is but little moisture  and not much of the earthy, but a great deal of air and of fire.  Therefore, it is not only without the earthy and watery elements, but  when fire, expelling the air from it by the operation and force of heat,  penetrates into its inmost parts and occupies the empty spaces of the  fissures, there comes a great glow and the stone is made to burn as  fiercely as do the particles of fire itself.    3. There are also several quarries called Anician in the territory of  Tarquinii, the stone being of the colour of peperino. The principal  workshops lie round the lake of Bolsena and in the prefecture of  Statonia. This stone has innumerable good qualities. Neither the season  of frost nor exposure to fire can harm it, but it remains solid and  lasts to a great age, because there is only a little air and fire in its  natural composition, a moderate amount of moisture, and a great deal of  the earthy. Hence its structure is of close texture and solid, and so it  cannot be injured by the weather or by the force of fire.    4. This may best be seen from monuments in the neighbourhood of the town  of Ferento which are made of stone from these quarries. Among them are  large statues exceedingly well made, images of smaller size, and flowers  and acanthus leaves gracefully carved. Old as these are, they look as  fresh as if they were only just finished. Bronze workers, also, make  moulds for the casting of bronze out of stone from these quarries, and  find it very useful in bronze-founding. If the quarries were only near  Rome, all our buildings might well be constructed from the products of  these workshops.    5. But since, on account of the proximity of the stone-quarries of  Grotta Rossa, Palla, and the others that are nearest to the city,  necessity drives us to make use of their products, we must proceed as  follows, if we wish our work to be finished without flaws. Let the stone  be taken from the quarry two years before building is to begin, and not  in winter but in summer. Then let it lie exposed in an open place. Such  stone as has been damaged by the two years of exposure should be used in  the foundations. The rest, which remains unhurt, has passed the test of  nature and will endure in those parts of the building which are above  ground. This precaution should be observed, not only with dimension  stone, but also with the rubble which is to be used in walls.    [Illustration: Photo. Moscioni    EXAMPLE OF OPUS INCERTUM. THE CIRCULAR TEMPLE AT TIVOLI]          CHAPTER VIII    METHODS OF BUILDING WALLS      1. There are two styles of walls: \"opus reticulatum,\" now used by  everybody, and the ancient style called \"opus incertum.\" Of these, the  reticulatum looks better, but its construction makes it likely to crack,  because its beds and builds spread out in every direction. On the other  hand, in the opus incertum, the rubble, lying in courses and imbricated,  makes a wall which, though not beautiful, is stronger than the  reticulatum.    2. Both kinds should be constructed of the smallest stones, so that the  walls, being thoroughly puddled with the mortar, which is made of lime  and sand, may hold together longer. Since the stones used are soft and  porous, they are apt to suck the moisture out of the mortar and so to  dry it up. But when there is abundance of lime and sand, the wall,  containing more moisture, will not soon lose its strength, for they will  hold it together. But as soon as the moisture is sucked out of the  mortar by the porous rubble, and the lime and sand separate and  disunite, the rubble can no longer adhere to them and the wall will in  time become a ruin.    3. This we may learn from several monuments in the environs of the city,  which are built of marble or dimension stone, but on the inside packed  with masonry between the outer walls. In the course of time, the mortar  has lost its strength, which has been sucked out of it by the porousness  of the rubble; and so the monuments are tumbling down and going to  pieces, with their joints loosened by the settling of the material that  bound them together.    4. He who wishes to avoid such a disaster should leave a cavity behind  the facings, and on the inside build walls two feet thick, made of red  dimension stone or burnt brick or lava in courses, and then bind them to  the fronts by means of iron clamps and lead. For thus his work, being no  mere heap of material but regularly laid in courses, will be strong  enough to last forever without a flaw, because the beds and builds, all  settling equally and bonded at the joints, will not let the work bulge  out, nor allow the fall of the face walls which have been tightly  fastened together.    5. Consequently, the method of construction employed by the Greeks is  not to be despised. They do not use a structure of soft rubble polished  on the outside, but whenever they forsake dimension stone, they lay  courses of lava or"]]]
