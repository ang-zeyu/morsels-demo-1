This colt was not an enemy, one who has already  been hunted by man. He was only afraid....\"    \"But you have the gift. It is born in one--the gift. A man has it, and the  horse always knows, answers to it. Ride with me, _senor_, and try that  gift on the wild ones!\"    \"Someday--\" That was true. Someday Drew did want to ride after the wild  ones. Anse's stories of horse hunting on the Texas plains had first  stirred that desire. Now it was fully awake in him.    _Don_ Cazar inspected the black closely. \"Well, Bartolome, what have you  to say now?\"    \"_Senor_ Kirby knows his business,\" the Mexican admitted. \"Though I think  also that this was no true wild one. He will make a good remount, but he  is no fighter such as others I have seen here.\"    Drew unsaddled and left the black in with Croaker; he fed both animals a  bait of oats. In the morning he would be at this again. And he still had  not solved the problem of roping. He could not expect Teodoro to come to  his aid a second time. He started slowly back to the bunkhouse.    \"_Senor_--?\"    Drew raised his wet head from the bunkhouse basin and reached out for a  sacking towel. \"Yes?\"    Leon sat on a near-by bunk. \"I have thought of something--\"    \"Sounds as if it might be important,\" Drew commented.    \"_Don_ Cazar, he has offered money--a hundred dollars in gold--to have off  the Range that killer pinto stud. But that one, he is like the Apache; he  is not to be caught.\"    \"Can't someone pick him off with a rifle?\"    \"Perhaps. Only that has also been tried several times, _senor_. My father,  he thought he had killed him only two months ago. But the very next week  did not the pinto come to steal mares from the bay _manada_? It must have  been that he was only creased. No, he is a _diablo_, and he hides in the  rocks where he cannot easily be seen. But there is a plan I have thought  of--\" Leon hesitated, and Drew guessed he was about to make a suggestion  which he believed might meet with disapproval.    \"And this plan of yours?\" Why had Leon come to him with it? Surely young  Rivas had better and closer friends at the Stronghold. Why approach a  newcomer?    \"That pinto--he is a fighter; he likes to fight. He will not allow another  stud on the ground he claims.\"    Drew was beginning to understand. Wild ones were sometimes trapped by a  belled mare staked out to draw them in. But a stud to catch a fighting  stud was another plan altogether.    \"You would offer him a fight?\"    \"_Si_, but not a real fight. Just allow him to believe that there would be  one. Pull him so out of hiding in the rocks--\"    \"Using what stud for bait?\"    \"_Senor_ Juanito--he said a stud that would fight too, like Shiloh.\"    \"Shiloh!\" Drew wadded the towel in his fist and pitched it across the  room. \"Shiloh!\"    Leon must have read something of Drew's blazing anger in his face, for the  Mexican's mouth went a little slack and his hand came up in an involuntary  gesture as if to ward off a blow.    \"It is a good plan!\" His boy's voice was thin in protest against Drew's  expression.    \"It is a harebrained, dangerous scheme,\" began Drew; then he switched to a  question. \"Did Johnny Shannon suggest using Shiloh for bait, or was that  your idea?\"    \"_Senor_ Juanito--he said one must have a good horse, a fighter. But such a  horse would not be hurt. We would wait with rifles and shoot the pinto  quickly before he attacked. There would be no harm to Shiloh, none at all.  _Senor_ Juanito said that. Only a trick to get the _diablo_ where we could  shoot. Maybe--\" Leon's eyes dropped, a flush rose slowly on his brown  cheeks--\"maybe it was very foolish. But when _Senor_ Juanito told it, it  sounded well.\"    \"Did he tell you to ask me about it?\"    The flush darkened. \"He did not say so, _senor_. But one would not do such  a thing without permission. Also, you should be one of the hunters, no?  How else could we go?\"    \"Well, there won't be any huntin' of that kind, Leon. Trinfan knows what  he's doin', and I don't think that pinto is goin' to be runnin' loose--or  alive--much longer.\"    Drew pulled a clean shirt over his head. What kind of game was Johnny  Shannon trying to play? Apparently he had almost talked Leon into using  Shiloh as bait in this fool stunt. Had he expected the kid to take the  horse without Drew's knowledge? Or for some reason had he wanted Leon to  spill this? A trick to get Shiloh out of the Stronghold? But why?    He buckled on his gun belt, settled the twin holsters comfortably.  Shannon--what and why, he repeated silently. Nothing sorted out in his  mind. Drew only felt a prickle of uneasiness which began between his  shoulder blades and ran a chill down his spine, as if rifle sights were on  him.    But Shannon did not return to the Stronghold, and Drew was kept busy at  the corrals from dawn to dusk. In a month of hard work it was easy to  forget what might only be fancies.        There was an invigorating crispness in the air, and the dun gelding the  Kentuckian rode savored the breeze as a desert dweller savors water. Drew  was indulgent with his mount's skittishness as they pounded along at the  tail of the horse herd bound for Tubacca.    From a rocky point well before them there was a flash of light. Jared Nye,  on Drew's left, took off his hat and waved a wide-armed signal to answer  Greyfeather's mirror. Two of the Pimas were scouting ahead on this two-day  drive, and the Anglo riders were keeping the herd to a trot. Apaches,  Kitchell, even _bandidos_ from over the border, could be sniffing about  the Range, eyeing its riches, ready to pick up anything left unprotected.  The men rode with their rifles free of the boot, fastened by a loop of  rawhide to the saddle horn, the old Texas precaution which allowed for  instant action. And at each halt the six-shooter Colts' loading was  checked.    Nye swerved, sending a lagger on with a sharp crack of quirt in the air.  He pulled up to match Drew's sobered trot.    \"That's the last bad stretch; now it'll be downhill an' green fields all  th' way.\" Nye nodded at the narrow opening between two hills lying ahead.  \"Glad to get this band in on all four legs an' runnin' easy.\"    \"You expected trouble?\"    \"Kid, in this here country you don't expect nothin' else but. Last time we  brought hosses up th' trail they jumped us four, five miles back--right  close to where we saw that pile of bones this mornin'. 'Fore he knew what  hit us Jim Berry was face down an' never got up again. An' th' Old Man  took him a crease 'crost th' ribs that made him bleed like a stuck pig.  Got him patched up an' into town; then he keeled over when he tried to git  down off his hoss an' was in bed a week.\"    \"Apaches?\"    \"Naw, we figured it was Kitchell. Couldn't prove it though, an' after that  th' Old Man made a rule we take Pimas every drive. Ain't nothin' able to  surprise them. I never had no use for Injuns, but these here are peaceful  cusses--iffen they don't smell an Apache. With them ridin' point we're sure  slidin' th' groove. Me, I'll be glad to hit town. I'd shore like to keep  th' barkeep busier than a beaver buildin' hisself a new dam. Though with  th' Old Man off reppin' for th' law down along the border and needin'  hands back on the Range, we swallows down th' dust nice an' easy an' takes  it slow. Anyway, this far from payday I kin count up mosta m' roll without  takin' it outta m' pocket.\"    \"This Kitchell...think it's true that some of the ranchers are really  helpin' him?\"    \"Don't know. Might be he's tryin' to play th' deuce against th' whole  deck. Lessen he lives on th' kind of whisky as would make a rabbit up an'  spit in a grizzly's eye hole, he's got somethin'--or someone--to back him.  Me...were th' Old Man poundin' th' hills flat lookin' for me, I'd crawl  th' nearest bronc an' make myself as scarce as a snake's two ears.\" Nye  shrugged. \"Kitchell's got some powerful reason for squattin' out in th'  brush playin' cat-eyed with most of th' territory. Maybe so there're some  as will sit in on his side, but they've sure got their jaws in a sling an'  ain't bawlin' about it none. 'Course lotsa people were red-hot Rebs back  in '61 till they saw as how white men fightin' each other jus' naturally  gave th' Apaches an' some of th' border riffraff idears 'bout takin' over.  But mosta us now ain't wavin' no flag. Iffen Kitchell has got him some  diehards backin' him--\" Nye shrugged again. \"Git 'long there, you  knock-kneed, goat-headed wagon-loafer!\" He pushed on to haze another  slacker.    They were dusty and dry when they dropped the corral gate in place and  watched the horses mill around. Drew headed for Kells' stable. Shadow  nickered a greeting and turned around as if to purposefully edge her  daughter forward for his inspection.    \"Pretty, ma'am,\" he told her. \"Very pretty. She's goin' to be as fine a  lady as her ma--I'm willin' to swear to that.\"    The filly lipped Drew's fingers experimentally and then snorted and did a  frisky little dance with her tiny hoofs rustling in the straw. Kells had  been as good as his promise, Drew noted. Mother and child had had expert  attention, and Shadow's coat had been groomed to a glossy silk; her black  mane and tail were rippling satin ribbons.    \"Gonna take 'em back to th' Range with you, Mister Kirby?\" Callie came  down from the loft.    \"Yes. I'll need a cart and driver though. We'll have to give the foal a  lift. Know anyone for hire, Callie?\"    \"I'll ask around. Have any trouble comin' up?\"    \"No. Greyfeather and Runnin' Fox were scoutin' for us.\"    \"Stage was jumped yesterday on th' Sonora road,\" Callie volunteered. \"One  men got him a bullet in th' shoulder, but they got away clean. It was  Kitchell, th' driver thought. Captain Bayliss took out a patrol right  away.

Also for  beginners whose hands are not strong it is sometimes wise to grind the  cutter with some \"crown\", in order to take off narrow shavings, which  require less strength. For school use, where the jack-plane is used  for all purposes, the cutter is usually ground almost straight and  only the corners rounded as in the smooth-plane and the fore-plane.[5]        [Footnote 5: In whetting a plane-bit, a slight crown may be given      it by rubbing a bit harder at the ends of the edge than in the      middle. Strop in the same way as a chisel (p. 59).]    The _fore-plane_, 22\" to 26\" long, and the _jointer_, 28\" to 30\" long,  are large planes, similar to the jack-plane, except that the cutting  edge is straight. They are used for straightening and smoothing long  pieces.    The _smooth-plane_, 5-1/2\" to 10\" long, is a short plane, similar to  the jack-plane, except that the cutting edge is straight. It is used  for smoothing.    These four planes, the jack-plane, the fore-plane, the jointer, and  the smooth-plane, are essentially alike, and directions for the use of  one apply to all.    There are two chief adjustments in the Bailey iron plane: the brass  set-screw, see 8 in Fig. 101, which regulates the depth of the cut,  and the lever, 9, which moves the cutter sidewise so that it may be  made to cut evenly. The skilful worker keeps constant watch of these  adjustments. It is well to form the habit of always sighting along  the sole before beginning to plane, in order to see that the cutter  projects properly, Fig. 102. It is a common mistake among beginners to  let the cutter project too far.    It is important to know what is the best order of procedure in planing  up a board. There are often reasons for omitting the planing up of  one or more surfaces, but it is wise to form the habit of following a  regular order, and the following is suggested as a good one:    1. Working face. Plane one broad side flat and smooth. Finish with the  plane set to cut line shavings. Test with try-square. Mark this face  with a distinct pencil mark, A, Fig. 103.    2. Working edge. Plane one narrow side straight and square with  the working face. Test with try-square, pressing the block of the  try-square against the working face. Mark the working edge with two  distinct pencil marks, B, Fig. 103.    3. End. First mark the width on the working face with the  marking-gage, C, 1-2, Fig. 103. Chisel off the corner, _a_, of the  piece outside this gaged line. True and smooth this end with the  plane, making it square with both working face and working edge, D, 2,  3, 4, Fig. 103.    4. Length. Measure the length from the finished end, D, 2-3-4, score  across the working face, D, 5-6, and working edge, D, 6-7, using a  sharp knife point and the try-square. Saw just outside this line, D,  5-6-7, with the back-saw, cut off the narrow corner, D, _b_, beyond  the gaged line and plane true, E, Fig. 103.    5. Width. Plane to the center of the gaged line, E, 1-2. Test this  edge from the working face, F, Fig. 103.    6. Thickness. Mark the thickness with the marking-gage all around the  piece, F, 8-9-10. Plane to the center of the gaged line, G, Fig. 103.  Test this face for flatness.    [Illustration: Fig. 103. The Order of Planing a Board.]    In a word, the order to be followed is graphically represented in  H, Fig. 103. The surfaces are numbered consecutively in the order in  which they are to be planed.    The advantages of this order are these: by planing the working face  first, a broad surface is secured to which the others may be made  true. By planing the ends before the width is planed, the danger of  splitting off fragments can be avoided by chiseling the corner of the  unfinished edges, C, _a_, and D, _b_, Fig. 103, into a buttress.  By planing the ends and the width before the thickness is planed,  a dressed face is secured all around for gaging the thickness. In  following this order all measurements and markings are made on a  dressed face.    [Illustration: Fig. 104. Sighting for Wind.]    If there be any \"wind\" or twist in the board, this should be  discovered first of all. This may be done roughly by sighting across  the broad side of the board, Fig. 104, and more accurately by the  use of \"winding sticks,\" see Fig. 205, p. 113. Or the surface may be  tested with the plane itself by tilting the plane on its long corner  edge, and resting it on the board, while the worker looks between the  board and the plane toward the light. It is evident that the plane  must be turned in various directions to test for wind, and that a  board only as long or as wide as the plane is long can be tested in  this way. The try-square or any straight edge may be used for the same  purpose, Fig. 105. If there be any wind in the board, this should at  once be taken out of one face by planing down the high corners.    [Illustration: Fig. 105. Testing from Edge to Edge.]    In starting to plane, the worker should bear down on the knob at the  front end of the plane. When the plane is well on the board, he should  bear down equally on both knob and handle, and as the plane begins to  pass off the board he should put all the pressure on the handle end,  Fig. 106. By taking pains thus, a convex surface will be avoided, the  making of which is a common error of beginners. On the return stroke,  the plane should be lifted or tilted so that the cutting edge will  not be dulled by rubbing on the wood. This is especially important  on rough and dirty boards, as it saves the cutting edge, and in fine  work, as it saves the work. If the plane tear the wood instead of  cutting it smooth, as it should, it is because the planing is \"against  the grain\". This can often be avoided by noticing the direction of  the grain before beginning to plane. But even if it be not noted  beforehand, a stroke or two will show the roughness. In such a case,  it is necessary simply to turn the wood around.    [Illustration: Fig. 106. Planing an Edge.]    The accuracy of the work as it progresses should frequently be tested,  and the eye should constantly be trained so that it can more and more  be depended upon to detect inaccuracy, Fig. 107. As each surface is  trued, it should be carefully smoothed with the cutter set to cut fine  shavings.    [Illustration: Fig. 107. Sighting an Edge.]    In planing a very cross-grained piece of wood, there are several  methods to use for securing a smooth surface. The frog of the plane  should be moved forward so that the throat in the front of the cutter  is a mere slit. In the ordinary plane it is necessary to remove the  cutter in order to reset the frog, but in the Sargent plane and the  Stanley \"bed rock\" plane, it can be set by a set-screw at the rear of  the frog. Next, the cap should be set so that the cutter projects but  very little beyond it, or, in technical language, the cutter should be  set \"fine.\" A sliding cut, see p. 53, should be taken with the plane,  and sometimes it may be necessary to move the plane nearly at right  angles to the general direction of the grain. By these means even  refractory pieces of wood can be well smoothed. See also scrapers, p.  91.    The choking of a plane is the stoppage of the throat by shavings.  It may be due simply to the fact that the cutter is dull or that  it projects too far below the sole of the plane. In a wooden plane  choking is sometimes due to the crowding of shavings under some part  of the wedge. When the adjustable frog in a modern plane is improperly  placed choking may result. The frog should be far enough forward so  that the cutter rests squarely upon it.    Choking may, and most commonly does, take place because the cap does  not fit down tight on the cutter. This happens if the cap be nicked or  uneven. In consequence, minute shavings are driven between these two  irons and choking soon results. The remedy is to sharpen the cap, so  that its edge makes a close fit with the cutter. The fit may be made  still tighter by rubbing with a screwdriver the edge of the cap down  on the cutter after it is screwed in place.    In no tool is it more important to keep the cutter sharp than in the  plane. To remove the cutter, in order to sharpen it, first loosen the  clamp lever and remove the clamp. Carefully remove the cap and cutter  taking pains not to let the edge hit any part of the plane, then using  the clamp as a screwdriver, loosen the cap-screw and slide the cap  back along the slot in the cutter, where it can be held fast by a turn  of the cap-screw. The edge is now free and can readily be whetted.  When the cap needs to be entirely removed, for instance, for grinding,  after it has been slid along the cutter slot, as before, it is turned  at right angles to the cutter, and then slid down the slot until the  cap-screw unbuttons from the cutter. The object in sliding the cap up  the slot before turning it, is to prevent the danger of injuring the  edge. Some caps are now made with the buttonhole at the upper end of  the slot.    After sharpening, (see under sharpening, p. 117.) the order is  reversed for replacing the cutter. The cap is set at right angles to  the cutter, the cap-screw dropped into the slot, the cap is slid up  the slot, and turned into line with the cutter, and then slid down the  slot till the edge of the cap comes quite near the edge of the cutter.  Then the two are held firmly together with the left hand until the cap  screw is turned tight.    In replacing the cutter and cap in the plane, care should be taken not  to injure the edge and to see that the Y adjustment lever fits into  the little slot in the cap; then finally the lever is"]]]
