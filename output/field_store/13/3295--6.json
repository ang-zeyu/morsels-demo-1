Hill climbing and bicycling also  tend to this end, but the latter is for many reasons not a form of  exercise to be recommended to one who wishes to attain the highest  results with the voice. Wind, dust, a stooping position, excessive  heat of the body, etc., are all among the many factors of risk for the  delicate vocal mechanism.    As the expiratory blast is so important in voice-production, the  exercises above recommended should be followed by others in which this  principle is specially recognized.    1. Inspire so as to fill the chest to the fullest with considerable  rapidity; then allow the breath-stream to pass out with the utmost  slowness.    2. Fill the chest with special reference to its lower or its upper  part, as desired, and very rapidly, letting the breath flow out  slowly.      SUMMARY.    The primary purpose of respiration in all animals is the same--namely,  to furnish oxygen and remove carbon dioxide (carbonic acid). The  lowest animals, as the amoeba, breathe by the whole surface of the  body. In all vertebrates the anatomical mechanism is essentially the  same: a membrane (covered with flat cells) in which the blood is  distributed in the minutest blood-vessels (capillaries). Respiration  is finally effected in the tissues (cells) of the body. The more  active the animal, or the higher in the scale, the more need of  frequent interchange between the air, the blood, and the tissues.    The respiratory organs in mammals are the mouth, nose, larynx,  trachea, bronchial tubes, and lung-tissue or air-cells proper. The  windpipe is made up of cartilaginous rings completed by membrane,  muscle, etc. (behind). The bronchial tubes are the continuation of the  windpipe, and branch tree-like until they become very fine. The  air-cells are built round these latter. The lung-tissue is highly  elastic. The lungs are made up of an elastic membrane, covered with  flat cells, and very abundantly supplied with a mesh-work of the  finest blood-vessels. The whole of the respiratory tract as far as the  air-cells is lined by mucous membrane.    The air consists essentially of 21 parts of oxygen and 79 parts of  nitrogen, with a variable quantity of watery vapor. Only a small  portion of the total oxygen of the air is removed before it is  exhaled. The respiratory act consists of (1) inspiration, and (2)  expiration; the latter is of a little longer duration than the former.  The rate of breathing in man is from 14 to 18 per minute, in the  resting state, or about one respiration to three or four heart-beats.  The quantity of air inspired depends on (1) the size of the thorax,  and (2) the extent of its movements. These are effected solely by  muscular contractions, and give rise to an increase in all the  diameters of the thorax. The lungs are closely applied (but not  attached) to the inside of the chest wall, and remain so under all  circumstances. When the chest cavity is enlarged by inspiration, the  air, pressing down into the elastic lungs, expands them as much as  possible, that is, as much as the chest walls will allow; but the  lungs are never at any time either filled with or emptied of air to  their utmost capacity. At most, the amount of expansion is very  moderate.      _The Quantity of Air in the Lungs._    1. The quantity of air inspired in quiet breathing is about 20-30  cubic inches.    2. The quantity that can be added to this by a deep inspiration is  about 100 cubic inches.    3. The quantity that can be expelled by a forcible expiration is about  100 cubic inches.    4. The quantity that cannot be expelled at all is about 100 cubic  inches.    The above are named: (1) The tidal air; (2) complemental air; (3)  supplemental air; (4) residual air. The quantity that can be expelled  by the most forcible expiration after the most forcible inspiration,  that is, the air that can be moved, indicating the \"vital capacity,\"  is about 225-250 inches.    The chest is enlarged by the muscles of inspiration, the principal of  which is the diaphragm or midriff. This muscle (tendinous in the  centre) is attached to the spinal column (behind) and to the last six  or seven ribs. When it contracts it becomes less domed upward, and is  pressed down more or less on the contents of the abdomen; hence the  walls of the latter move outward. During ordinary inspiration the  lower ribs are steadied by other muscles, so that no indrawing of  these ribs takes place, but a very forcible expiration makes such  indrawing very noticeable. In addition to the enlargement of the chest  by the descent of the diaphragm, the ribs are elevated and everted by  the muscles attached to them, with the total result that the chest  cavity is enlarged in all its three diameters during inspiration. The  first rib is fixed by muscles from above. During extremely forced  inspiration a large proportion of all the muscles of the body may act.  Ordinary expiration is the result largely of the elastic recoil of the  chest walls, only a few muscles taking part. The diaphragm ascends and  becomes more domed. During forced expiration many other muscles are  called into action. It is of importance for the singer and speaker to  note: (1) That the chest cavity should be increased in all its  directions; (2) that the muscular action should be easy and under  perfect control, but also vigorous when required; (3) that the breath  be taken through the nostrils when the individual is not actually  vocalizing or about to do so; (4) that the breath be kept in or let  out in the proportion required.    Breathing is a reflex or involuntary act. The respiratory centre,  consisting of an expiratory and inspiratory division, is situated in  the bulb, or medulla oblongata, the portion of the brain just above  the spinal cord. All the ingoing nervous impulses affect respiration  through the outgoing impulses that pass along the nerves to the  muscles; that is, the ingoing impulses pass up by the nerves from the  lungs to the centre, and thence along other nerves to the respiratory  muscles. The condition of the blood determines the activity of the  respiratory centre, but the incoming impulses regulate this activity.  The respiratory centre can be approached from every part of the body.      _Hygiene._    Every thing that favors the full and free expansion of the chest in a  pure atmosphere is favorable, and the reverse unfavorable. Corsets are  against the laws of beauty, are unnecessary for support, and may by  compression injure and displace important organs, as the liver,  stomach, etc.; and must interfere with the fullest expansion of the  chest. They have militated against the physical, and indirectly the  moral and mental advancement of the race.      _Practical Exercises._    I. Measurements of the chest.    II. Exercises to strengthen muscles, promote complete expansion,  regulate inflow and outflow of air, etc.    1. (_a_) Inspiring slowly, with counting.     (_b_) Holding.     (_c_) Expiring slowly, with counting.    2. The same, holding longer.    3. The same, with shorter inspiration and longer expiration. Gradually  diminish first and lengthen last.    4. Breathing through open lips.    5. Exercises to strengthen diaphragm.    6. Exercises to improve shape of chest and strengthen muscles.    7. Exercises to strengthen abdominal muscles.          CHAPTER VI.    THE SPECIAL VOICE-PRODUCING MECHANISM, THE LARYNX.      The larynx, or voice-box, is not the sole voice-producing apparatus,  as is often supposed, but it is of great, possibly the greatest,  importance. In describing the parts of this portion of the vocal  mechanism the author deems it wiser to use the terms commonly employed  by anatomists and physiologists, as others are awkward and inadequate.  Moreover, there is this great advantage in learning the technical  names of structures, that should the reader desire to consult a  special work on anatomy in reference to this or other important  organs, he will find in use the same terms as he has himself already  learned. Such are, as a matter of fact, not difficult to learn or  remember if one knows their derivation or other reason for their  employment. All the muscles of the larynx have names which are not  arbitrary but based on the names of the structures to which they are  attached, so that one has but to know their connections and the names  of the solid structures, which are few, to have a key to the whole  nomenclature.    When one is not using the voice the larynx is simply a part of the  respiratory apparatus, but when one phonates this organ assumes a  special function for which specific structures are essential. As  sound is caused by vibrations of the air, and these may be set up by  vibrations of the vocal cords, it may with absolute correctness be  said that the whole larynx exists for the vocal bands so far as  voice-production is concerned. Such a view renders the study of the  larynx much more interesting and rational; one is then engaged in  working out that solution of a problem which Nature has accomplished.    The vocal cords, we can conceive, might be either relaxed or  tightened, and lengthened or shortened, or both, and beyond that we  can scarcely understand how they might have been modified so as to be  effective in the production of sounds of different pitch. As a matter  of fact, these are the methods Nature has employed to accomplish her  purpose. For each vocal cord one fixed point, and only one, is  required. We know of only one method in use by Nature to cause  movement in living structures--viz., contraction, and muscle is the  tissue which above all others has that property; hence the movements  of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19881"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Carlisle (#11)"],[1,"on the right hand of God the Father                        Almighty      ST.

At the time of the Reformation these paintings were all whitewashed.  Dean Percy (1778) removed the whitewash from some of them, and they are  now all restored to their original condition as far as possible.    #Retro-choir.#--The extreme eastern bay of each aisle, and the passage  behind the altar, form the retro-choir, which is Late Decorated.    Its acutely-pointed windows are practically of identical pattern, the  mullions and side-mouldings having richly floriated capitals.    The last arch of the main arcade is supported by a bracket of foliage. A  fragment of rib still remaining was for the cross-groining of the aisle;  but as this would have interfered with the arch mouldings, the rib was  terminated higher up the wall upon a bracket in the form of a crouching  figure.    The wall-arcade has three divisions, the capitals of the columns are  foliated, and the point where the hood mouldings meet is ornamented with  the carving of a human head.    The low doorway forms the entrance to a staircase leading to the upper  part of the cathedral, and the belfry.    Beneath the great east window there is a plain tablet in memory of  Archdeacon Paley, and another in memory of his two wives and infant son.    Another tablet is in memory of Dean Cramer: \"Apud Oxonienses Historiae  Profr. Regius,\" died 1848.    Opposite is a monument to Bishop Law, the work of T. Banks, R.A. A  figure of Religion leaning on a cross is above the tablet. This monument  was originally fixed on the pillar behind the pulpit (\"Columnae hujus  sepultus est ad pedem\"). It was removed to the north aisle because of  the weakening of the pillar through having been cut to receive the  memorial; and in 1894 was again removed and fixed here, about as far  away from the bishop's grave as it could possibly be placed.    Under the great window, a little to the south, is a tombstone, similar  to that of Bishop Bell in the choir, but the brass is missing.    On the south side the last arch of the main arcade is supported by a  bracket representing a human figure sustaining mouldings, resembling the  one at the end of the north aisle.    The small east window is in memory of John Heysham, M.D. (1753-1834). He  graduated at Edinburgh in 1777, and settled in Carlisle where he  practised till his death. He is famous for his statistical observations;  a record of the annual births, marriages, diseases, and deaths in  Carlisle (ten years to 1788); a census of the inhabitants in 1780 and  1788. The actuary of the Sun Life Assurance Office used these statistics  as the basis of the well-known \"Carlisle Table of Mortality.\" Aided by  the dean and chapter he established the first dispensary for the poor at  Carlisle. He died in 1834, and was buried in St. Mary's Church.    One of the heads ornamenting the wall-arcade is said to represent Edward  I.    The #South Choir Aisle# is in most particulars the same as the  corresponding aisle on the north. The windows of its two bays next to  St. Catherine's Chapel are Early English of a later period than the  others, but the effect they produce is not by any means so pleasing. The  decorations of the capitals of the Early English columns are not so  elaborate as those in the north choir aisle.    In the third bay east of St. Catherine's Chapel, two arches of the  wall-arcade have been thrown into one, forming a doorway. The arch is  formed by seven segments, and its hood-moulding terminates in the  cornice immediately above the arcade.    #Monuments in South Choir Aisle.#--At the east end is an altar tomb with  recumbent effigy in white marble, of Bishop Waldegrave, by H.H.  Armstead, R.A.    The words \"vae mihi si non evangelizavero\" (1 Cor. ix. 16) are on the  edge of the upper part of the tomb. Below this is the following  inscription:--      Samuel Waldegrave    57th Bishop of Carlisle    Born Sept. 13, 1817; Consecrated, Nov. 12, 1860;    Entered into rest Oct. 1, 1869.    \"To me to live is Christ and to die is gain.\"      Phil. i. 21.      A tribute of    Affection, Admiration, and Respect.    Raised by public subscription.      A.D. 1872.    A recess with low pointed arch beneath the third window from the east  formerly contained a monument to Sir John Skelton, Knt. (1413-22).    Outside St. Catherine's Chapel is an altar tomb with a damaged effigy in  red sandstone of Bishop Barrow (1423-29). Originally it was painted and  gilt, and, although greatly injured, the remains show that the statue  was well executed.    Opposite, under a carved oak canopy, is a bronze recumbent figure by  Hamo Thornycroft, R.A., of Harvey Goodwin. The following is inscribed on  a bronze tablet:      In memory of Harvey Goodwin,    Fifty-eighth Bishop of Carlisle.    at Cambridge, and Ely, and in this diocese    a proved leader of men.    Learned, eloquent, wise, untiring,    he used his rare gifts of mind and heart    in the service of his master    for the good of the English people,    and of the Church of Christ at home and abroad.      Born, Oct. 9, 1818; Consecrated, Nov. 30, 1869; Died, Nov. 25, 1891.    Next to this, under a richly-carved canopy, is a recumbent figure in  white marble, by H.H. Armstead, R.A., of Dean Close. The monument bears  the following inscription:--      Francis Close, D.D.,    25 years Dean of this cathedral, died 1882, aged 85.    Erected by public subscription as a mark    of affection and esteem (1884).    The canopy, given by his son, bears the words following: \"This canopy  was erected by Admiral Close in memory of his father.\"    Francis Close was born in 1797, and was educated at St. John's,  Cambridge. From 1826 till 1856 he held the living of Cheltenham. He was  a liberal subscriber to societies for various philanthropic purposes  whether in connection with the Established Church or not. In 1856 he was  nominated Dean of Carlisle. Although a very popular preacher his  theological views were far from broad. He was, also, a strenuous  opponent of betting, theatre-going, indulgence in alcoholic liquors, and  smoking. The poor people of Carlisle lost a good friend when he passed  away. His failing health obliged him to give up the deanery in 1881, and  at the end of the following year he died at Penzance, where he was  wintering.    The fourth window is filled with glass in memory of members of the  Mounsey family, and Captain John Oswald Lambert.    The following subjects are represented:--      Our Lord               The Transfiguration.    Pilate writing    rebuking                                       the title    the Sea.                                       for the Cross.      The Adoration          The entry into          Our Lord    of the Magi.           Jerusalem.              before Pilate.      St. Paul               St. Paul before         St. Paul    before the             King Agrippa.           on board    Chief Priests.                                 ship.    At the back of the bishop's throne are some shelves containing a few  standard devotional books for the use of the congregation before and  after divine service. It would be a good thing if this custom could be  generally adopted, and every church in the land furnished with a small  library of the works of such men as Thomas a Kempis, St. Augustine,  Taylor, Law, and Keble.    The low doorway in the north-eastern angle of the retro-choir opens on a  staircase leading to the upper part of the cathedral, and the tower.    If we ascend to the clerestory we may pass along the ambulatory, and  obtain a nearer view of the great east window (especially the old glass  in the tracery), the choir roof, and the clerestory windows. At the end  of the ambulatory we come to the belfry.    There are six #Bells#, one of which, bearing the date 1396, was  furnished by Bishop Strickland. It is inscribed as follows:--      In: voce: sum: munda: maria;    sonando: secunda.    Another bell bears the following sentence:--      \"Jesus be our speed.\" Date 1608.    A third has on the rim--\"This ringe was made six tuneable bells at the  charge of the Lord Howard and other gentree of the country and citie,  and officers of the garrisson, by the advice of Majer Jeremiah Tolhurst,  governor of the garrisson 1658.\" This bell was cracked while ringing  during the rejoicings held in honour of the peace after Waterloo.    On a bell dated 1657 can be read, \"I warne you how your time doth pass  away, Serve God therefore while life doth last, and say Glorie in  excelsis Deo.\"    Of the remaining bells, one is dated 1659, and the other 1728.    In war time the tower was useful as a watch-tower, especially when the  enemy was approaching from Scotland. The small turret was used for fire  signals.    There is an interesting record in connection with the tower which is  found in an account of the trial of the Governor of Carlisle in 1745. It  is as follows:--    \"I desired that two men might be posted upon the high Tower of the  Cathedral with a very large spying glass I had brought with me, and to  send me a report of what they observed in the country. The Chancellor  proposed to the clergy to take this duty, which they readily did, and  were very exact and vigilant, and when the Rebells came before Carlisle  they took up arms as Volunteers most of whom served under me as  aides-de-camp.\"[6]      [6] \"Guide to the Cathedral of Carlisle,\" by R.H. and K.H.
