Ancient guide-books of Rome, published in the middle of the fourth  century,[34] mention four hundred and twenty-four temples, three  hundred and four shrines, eighty statues of gods, of precious metal,  sixty-four of ivory, and three thousand seven hundred and eighty-five  miscellaneous bronze statues. The number of marble statues is not  given. It has been said, however, that Rome had two populations of  equal size, one alive, and one of marble.    I have had the opportunity of witnessing or conducting the discovery  of several temples, altars, shrines, and bronze statues. The number of  marble statues and busts discovered in the last twenty-five years,  either in Rome or the Campagna, may be stated at one thousand.    Before beginning the description of these beautiful monuments, I must  allude to some details concerning the management and organization of  ancient places of worship, upon which recent discoveries have thrown a  considerable, and in some cases, unexpected light.    Roman temples, like the churches of the present day, were used not  only as places of worship, but as galleries of pictures, museums of  statuary, and \"cabinets\" of precious objects. In chapter v. of  \"Ancient Rome,\" I have given the catalogue of the works of art  displayed in the temple of Apollo on the Palatine. The list includes:  The Apollo and Artemis driving a quadriga, by Lysias; fifty statues of  the Danaids; fifty of the sons of Egypt; the Herakles of Lysippos;  Augustus with the attributes of Apollo (a bronze statue fifty feet  high); the pediment of the temple, by Bupalos and Anthermos; statues  of Apollo, by Skopas; Leto, by Kephisodotos, son of Praxiteles;  Artemis, by Timotheos; and the nine Muses; also a chandelier, formerly  dedicated by Alexander the Great at Kyme; medallions of eminent men; a  collection of gold plate; another of gems and intaglios; ivory  carvings; specimens of palaeography; and two libraries.    [Illustration: Entablature of the Temple of Concord.]    The Temple of Apollo was by no means the only sacred museum of ancient  Rome; there were scores of them, beginning with the Temple of  Concord, so emphatically praised by Pliny. This temple, built by  Camillus, at the foot of the Capitol, and restored by Tiberius and  Septimius Severus, was still standing at the time of Pope Hadrian I.  (772-795), when the inscription on its front was copied for the last  time by the _Einsiedlensis_. It was razed to the ground towards 1450.  \"When I made my first visit to Rome,\" says Poggio Bracciolini, \"I saw  the Temple of Concord almost intact (_aedem fere integram_), built of  white marble. Since then the Romans have demolished it, and turned the  structure into a lime-kiln.\" The platform of the temple and a few  fragments of its architectural decorations were discovered in 1817.  The reader may appreciate the grace of these decorations, from a  fragment of the entablature now in the portico of the Tabularium, and  one of the capitals of the cella, now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori.  The cella contained one central and ten side niches, in which eleven  masterpieces of Greek chisels were placed, namely, the Apollo and  Hera, by Baton; Leto nursing Apollo and Artemis, by Euphranor;  Asklepios and Hygieia, by Nikeratos; Ares and Hermes, by Piston; and  Zeus, Athena, and Demeter, by Sthennis. The name of the sculptor of  the Concordia in the apse is not known. Pliny speaks also of a picture  by Theodoros, representing Cassandra; of four elephants, cut in  obsidian, a miracle of skill and labor, and of a collection of  precious stones, among which was the sardonyx set in the legendary  ring of Polykrates of Samos. Most of these treasures had been offered  to the goddess by Augustus, moved by the liberality which Julius Caesar  had shown towards his ancestral goddess, Venus Genetrix. We know from  Pliny, xxxv. 9, that Caesar was the first to give due honor to  paintings, by exhibiting them in his Forum Julium. He gave about  $72,000 (eighty talents), for two works of Timomachos, representing  Medea and Ajax. At the base of the Temple of Venus Genetrix he placed  his own equestrian statue, the horse of which, modelled by Lysippos,  had once supported the figure of Alexander the Great. The statue of  Venus was the work of Arkesilaos, and her breast was covered with  strings of British pearls. Pliny (xxxvii. 5), after mentioning the  collection of gems made by Scaurus, and another made by Mithradates,  which Pompey the Great had offered to Jupiter Capitolinus, adds:  \"These examples were surpassed by Caesar the dictator, who offered to  Venus Genetrix six collections of cameos and intaglios.\"    A descriptive catalogue of these valuables and works of art was kept  in each temple, and sometimes engraved on marble. The inventories  included also the furniture and properties of the sacristy. In 1871  the following remarkable document was discovered in the Temple of  Diana Nemorensis. The inventory, engraved on a marble pillar three  feet high, is now preserved in the Orsini Castle at Nemi. It has been  published by Henzen in \"Hermes,\" vol. vi. p. 8, and reads as follows,  in translation:--    Objects offered to [or belonging to] both temples [the temple of Isis  and that of Bubastis]:--Seventeen statues; one head of the Sun; four  silver images; one medallion; two bronze altars; one tripod (in the  shape of one at Delphi); a cup for libations; a patera; a diadem [for  the statue of the goddess] studded with gems; a sistrum of gilded  silver; a gilt cup; a patera ornamented with ears of corn; a necklace  studded with beryls; two bracelets with gems; seven necklaces with  gems; nine ear-rings with gems; two nauplia [rare shells from the  Propontis]; a crown with twenty-one topazes and eighty carbuncles; a  railing of brass supported by eight _hermulae_; a linen costume  comprising a tunica, a pallium, a belt, and a stola, all trimmed with  silver; a like costume without trimming.    [Objects offered] to Bubastis:--A costume of purple silk; another of  turquoise color; a marble vase with pedestal; a water jug; a linen  costume with gold trimmings and a golden girdle; another of plain  white linen.    The objects described in this catalogue did not belong to the Temple  of Diana itself, one of the wealthiest in central Italy; but to two  small shrines, of Isis and Bubastis, built by a devotee within the  sacred enclosure, on the north side of the square.    The ancients displayed remarkably bad taste in loading the statues of  their gods with precious ornaments, and in spoiling the beauty of  their temples with hangings of every hue and description. A document  published by Muratori[35] speaks of a statue of Isis which was  dedicated by a lady named Fabia Fabiana as a memorial to her deceased  granddaughter Avita. The statue, cast in silver, weighed one hundred  and twelve and a half pounds, and was muffled in ornaments and jewelry  beyond conception. The goddess wore a diadem in which were set six  pearls, two emeralds, seven beryls, one carbuncle, one _hyacinthus_,  and two flint arrow-heads; also earrings with emeralds and pearls, a  necklace composed of thirty-six pearls and eighteen emeralds, two  clasps, two rings on the little finger, one on the third, one on the  middle finger; and many other gems on the shoes, ankles, and wrists.  Another inscription discovered at Constantine, Algeria, describes a  statue of Jupiter dedicated in the Capitol of that city. The devotees  had placed on his head an oak-wreath of silver, with thirty leaves and  fifteen acorns; they had loaded his right hand with a silver disk, a  Victory waving a palm-leaf, and a crown of forty leaves; and in the  other had fastened a silver rod and other emblems.    The hangings and tinsel not only disfigured the interior of temples,  but were a source of danger from their combustibility. When we hear of  fires destroying the Pantheon in A. D. 110, the Temple of Apollo in  363, that of Venus and Rome in 307, and that of Peace in 191, we may  assume that they were started and fed by the inflammable materials  with which the interiors were filled. There is no other explanation to  be given, inasmuch as the structures were fire-proof, with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22157"],[0,"Lectures on Stellar Statistics (#11)"],[1,"      |(1432{60})|  GD_10 | 284 | - 2   | 0.759 |  0.27 |  | 3|Barnards p. m. star   |(175204)  |  GC_12 | 358 | +12   | 0.515 |  0.40 |  | 4|Lal. 21185            |(105736)  |  GB_5  | 153 | +66   | 0.403 |  0.51 |  | 5|Sirius                |(0640{16})|  GD_7  | 195 | - 8   | 0.376 |  0.55 |  | 6|            ..        |(1113{57})|  GC_6  | 158 | + 3   | 0.337 |  0.60 |  | 7|[tau] Ceti            |(0139{16})|  GF_1  | 144 | -74   | 0.334 |  0.62 |  | 8|Procyon               |(073405)  |  GC_7  | 182 | +14   | 0.324 |  0.64 |  | 9|C.

What is the absolute magnitude of the near stars that are not contained  in table? Evidently they must principally be faint stars. We may go  further and answer that _all stars with an absolute magnitude brighter  than 6m_ must be contained in this list. For if _M_ is equal to 6 or  brighter, _m_ must be brighter than 6m, if the star is nearer than one  siriometer. But we have assumed that all stars apparently brighter than  6m are known and are contained in the list. Hence also all stars  _absolutely_ brighter than 6m must be found in table 5. We conclude that  the number of stars having an absolute magnitude brighter than 6m  amounts to 8.    If, finally, the spectral type of the near stars is considered, we find  from the last column of the table that these stars are distributed in  the following way:--        Spectral type   B A F G K M      Number          0 2 2 5 9 3.    For two of the stars the spectrum is for the present unknown.    We find that the number of stars increases with the spectral index. The  unknown stars in the siriometer sphere belong probably, in the main, to  the red types.    If we now seek to form a conception of the _total_ number in this sphere  we may proceed in different ways. EDDINGTON, in his \"Stellar movements\",  to which I refer the reader, has used the proper motions as a scale of  calculation, and has found that we may expect to find in all 32 stars in  this sphere, confining ourselves to stars apparently brighter than the  magnitude 9m.5. This makes 8 stars per cub. sir.    We may attack the problem in other ways. A very rough method which,  however, is not without importance, is the following. Let us suppose  that the Galaxy in the direction of the Milky Way has an extension of  1000 siriometers and in the direction of the poles of the Milky Way an  extension of 50 sir. We have later to return to the fuller discussion of  this extension. For the present it is sufficient to assume these values.  The whole system of the Galaxy then has a volume of 200 million cubic  siriometers. Suppose further that the total number of stars in the  Galaxy would amount to 1000 millions, a value to which we shall also  return in a following chapter. Then we conclude that the average number  of stars per cubic siriometer would amount to 5. This supposes that the  density of the stars in each part of the Galaxy is the same. But the sun  lies rather near the centre of the system, where the density is  (considerably) greater than the average density. A calculation, which  will be found in the mathematical part of these lectures, shows that the  density in the centre amounts to approximately 16 times the average  density, giving 80 stars per cubic siriometer in the neighbourhood of  the sun (and of the centre). A sphere having a radius of one siriometer  has a volume of 4 cubic siriometers, so that we obtain in this way 320  stars in all, within a sphere with a radius of one siriometer. For  different reasons it is probable that this number is rather too great  than too small, and we may perhaps estimate the total number to be  something like 200 stars, of which more than a tenth is now known to the  astronomers.    We may also arrive at an evaluation of this number by proceeding from  the number of stars of different apparent or absolute magnitudes. This  latter way is the most simple. We shall find in a later paragraph that  the absolute magnitudes which are now known differ between -8 and +13.  But from mathematical statistics it is proved that the total range of a  statistical series amounts upon an average to approximately 6 times the  dispersion of the series. Hence we conclude that the dispersion  ([sigma]) of the absolute magnitudes of the stars has approximately the  value 3 (we should obtain [sigma] = [13 + 8] : 6 = 3.5, but for large  numbers of individuals the total range may amount to more than 6  [sigma]).    As, further, the number of stars per cubic siriometer with an absolute  magnitude brighter than 6 is known (we have obtained 8 : 4 = 2 stars per  cubic siriometer brighter than 6m), we get a relation between the total  number of stars per cubic siriometer (_D_0_) and the mean absolute  magnitude (_M_0_) of the stars, so that _D_0_ can be obtained, as soon  as _M_0_ is known. The computation of _M_0_ is rather difficult, and is  discussed in a following chapter. Supposing, for the moment, _M_0_ = 10  we get for _D_0_ the value 22, corresponding to a number of 90 stars  within a distance of one siriometer from the sun. We should then know a  fifth part of these stars.      34. _Parallax stars._ In Sec.22 I have paid attention to the now available  catalogues of stars with known annual parallax. The most extensive of  these catalogues is that of WALKEY, containing measured parallaxes of  625 stars. For a great many of these stars the value of the parallax  measured must however be considered as rather uncertain, and I have  pointed out that only for such stars as have a parallax greater than  0\".04 (or a distance"]]]
