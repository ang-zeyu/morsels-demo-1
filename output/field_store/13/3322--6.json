Scientific theories are  not so much formulae extracted from experience as intuitions imposed  upon experience. So it was that Goethe, who was little more than a  dilettante,[70] seized upon the essential principles of a morphology  some years before that morphology was accepted by the workers.    Goethe is important in the history of morphological method because he  was the first to bring to clear consciousness and to express in  definite terms the idea on which comparative anatomy before him was  based, the idea of the unity of plan. We have seen that this idea was  familiar to Aristotle and that it was recognised implicitly by all who  after him studied structure comparatively. In Goethe's time the idea  had become ripe for expression. It was used as a guiding principle in  Goethe's youth particularly by Vicq d'Azyr and by Camper. The former  (1748-1794), who discovered[71] in the same year as Goethe (1784) the  intermaxillary bone in man, pointed out the homology in structure  between the fore limb and the hind limb, and interpreted certain  rudimentary bones, the intermaxillaries and rudimentary clavicles, in  the light of the theory that Vertebrates are built upon one single  plan of structure.    \"Nature seems to operate always according to an original and general  plan, from which she departs with regret and whose traces we come  across everywhere\" (Vicq d'Azyr, quoted by Flourens, _Mem. Acad.  Sei._, XXIII., p. xxxvi.).    Peter Camper (1722-1789), we are told by Goethe himself in his  _Osteologie_, was convinced of the unity of plan holding throughout  Vertebrates; he compared in particular the brain of fishes with the  brain of man.    The idea of the unity of plan had not yet become limited and defined  as a strictly scientific theory; it was an idea common to philosophy,  to ordinary thought, and to anatomical science. We find it expressed  by Herder (who perhaps got it from Kant) in his _Ideen sur Philosophie  der Geschichte der Menschheit_ (1784), and it is possible that Goethe  became impressed with the importance of the idea through his  conversations with Herder. Be that as it may, it is certain that  Goethe sought for the intermaxillaries in man only because he was  firmly convinced that the skeleton in all the higher animals was built  upon one common plan and that accordingly bones such as the  intermaxillaries, found well developed in some animals, must also be  found in man. The idea was not drawn from the facts, but the facts  were interpreted and even sought for in the light of the idea. \"I  eagerly worked upon a general osteological scheme, and had accordingly  to assume that all the separate parts of the structure, in detail as  in the whole, must be discoverable in all animals, because on this  supposition is built the already long begun science of comparative  anatomy.\"[72]    The principle comes to clear expression in his _Erster Entwurf einer  allgemeinen Einleitung in die vergleichende Anatomie_ (1795).[73] He  writes:--\"On this account an attempt is here made to arrive at an  anatomical type, a general picture in which the forms of all animals  are contained in potentia, and by means of which we can describe each  animal in an invariable order.\"[74] His aim is to discover a general  scheme of the constant in organic parts, a scheme into which all  animals will fit equally well, and no animal better than the rest.  When we remember that the type to which anatomists before him had,  consciously or unconsciously, referred all other structure was man  himself, we see that in seeking after an abstract generalised type  Goethe was reaching out to a new conception. The fact that only the  structure of man and the higher animals was at all well-known in his  time led Goethe to think that his general Typus would hold for the  lower animals as well, though it was to be arrived at primarily from a  study of the higher animals. All he could assert of the entire animal  kingdom was that all animals agreed in having a head, a middle part,  and an end part, with their characteristic organs, and that  accordingly they might, in this respect at least, be reduced to one  common Typus. Goethe's knowledge of the lower animals was not  extensive.    Though Goethe did not work out a criterion of the homology of parts  with any great clearness, he had an inkling of the principle later  developed by E. Geoffroy St Hilaire, and called by him the \"Principle  of Connections.\" According to this principle, the homology of a part  is determined by its position relative to other parts. Goethe  expresses it thus:--\"On the other hand the most constant factor is the  position in which the bone is invariably found, and the function to  which it is adapted in the organic edifice.\"[75] But from this sentence  it is not clear that Goethe understood the principle as one of form  independent of function, for he seems to consider that the homology of  an organ is partly determined by the function which it performs for  the whole. He wavers between the purely formal or morphological  interpretation of the principle of connections and the functional. We  find him in the additions to the _Entwurf_ (1796), saying:--\"We must  take into consideration not merely the spatial relations of the parts,  but also their living reciprocal influence, their dependence upon and  action on one another.\" [76] But in seeking for the intermaxillary bone  in man he was guided by its position relative to the maxillaries--it  must be the bone between the anterior ends of the maxillaries, a bone  whose limits are indicated in the adult only by surface grooves.    As a matter of fact Goethe's morphological views are neither very  clearly expressed nor very consistent. This comes out in his treatment  of the relation between structure and function. Sometimes he takes the  view that structure determines function. \"The parts of the animal,\" he  writes, \"their reciprocal forms, their relations, their particular  properties determine the life and habits of the creature.\"[77] We are  not to explain, he says, the tusks of the _Babirussa_ by their  possible use, but we must ask how it comes to have tusks. In the same  way we must not suppose that a bull has horns in order to gore, but we  must investigate the process by which it comes to have horns to gore  with. This is the rigorous morphological view. On the other hand he  admits elsewhere that function may influence form. Apparently he did  not work out his ideas on this point to logical clearness, and Radl[78]  is probably correct in saying that the following quotation with its  double assertion represents most nearly Goethe's position:--    \"Also bestimmt die Gestalt die Lebensweise des Thieres, Und die Weise  zu leben, sie wirkt auf alle Gestalten Maechtig zurueck.\"[79]    His best piece of purely morphological work was his theory of the  metamorphosis of plants. Stripped of its vaguer elements, and of the  crude attempt to explain differences in the character of plant organs  by differences in the degree of \"refinement\" of the sap supplied to  them, the theory is that stem-leaves, sepals, petals, and stamens are  all identical members or appendages. These appendages differ from one  another only in shape and in degree of expansion, stem-leaves being  expanded, sepals contracted, petals expanded, and so on alternately.  It is equally correct to call a stamen a contracted petal, and a petal  an expanded stamen, for no one of the organs is the type of the  others, but all equally are varieties of a single abstract  plant-appendage.    What Goethe considered he had proved for the appendages of plants he  extended to all living things. Every living thing is a complex of  living independent beings, which \"der Idee, der Anlage nach,\" are the  same, but in appearance may be the same or similar, different or  unlike.[80] Not only is there a primordial animal and a primordial  plant, schematic forms to which all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20439"],[0,"Susan B. Anthony (#11)"],[1," a wife's wages to her husband.    In spite of the fact that the bloomer costume made it easier for her  to get about in the snowy streets, she now found it a real burden  because it always attracted unfavorable attention. Boys jeered at her  and she was continually conscious of the amused, critical glances of  the men and women she met. She longed to take it off and wear an  inconspicuous trailing skirt, but if she had been right to put it on,  it would be weakness to take it off. By this time Elizabeth Stanton  had given it up except in her own home, convinced that it harmed the  cause and that the physical freedom it gave was not worth the price.  \"I hope you have let down a dress and a petticoat,\" she now wrote  Susan. \"The cup of ridicule is greater than you can bear. It is not  wise, Susan, to use up so much energy and feeling in that way. You  can put them to better use. I speak from experience.\"[44]    [Illustration: Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her son, Henry]    Lucy Stone too was wavering and was thinking of having her next dress  made long. The three women corresponded about it, and Lucy as well as  Mrs. Stanton urged Susan to give up the bloomer. With these entreaties  ringing in her ears, Susan set out for Albany in February 1854 to make  final arrangements for the convention. On the streets in Albany, in  the printing offices, and at the capitol, men stared boldly at her,  some calling out hilariously, \"Here comes my bloomer.\" She endured it  bravely until her work was done, but at night alone in her room at  Lydia Mott's she poured out her anguish in letters to Lucy. \"Here I am  known only,\" she wrote, \"as one of the women who ape men--coarse,  brutal men! Oh, I can not, can not bear it any longer.\"[45]    Even so she did not let down the hem of her skirt, but wore her  bloomer costume heroically during the entire convention, determined  that she would not be stampeded into a long skirt by the jeers of  Albany men or the ridicule of the women. However, she made up her mind  that immediately after the convention she would take off the bloomer  forever. She had worn it a little over a year. Never again could she  be lured into the path of dress reform.    The Albany _Register_ scoffed at the \"feminine propagandists of  woman's rights\" exhibiting themselves in \"short petticoats and  long-legged boots.\"[46] Nevertheless, the convention aroused such  genuine interest that evening meetings were continued for two weeks,  featuring as speakers Ernestine Rose, Antoinette Brown, Samuel J. May,  and William Henry Channing, the young Unitarian minister from  Rochester; and when the men appeared on the platform, the audience  called for the women.    Susan could not have asked for anything better than Elizabeth  Stanton's moving plea for property rights for married women and the  attention it received from the large audience in the Senate Chamber.  Her heart swelled with pride as she listened to her friend, and so  important did she think the speech that she had 50,000 copies printed  for distribution.    To back up Mrs. Stanton's words with concrete evidence of a demand for  a change in the law, Susan presented petitions with 10,000 signatures,  6,000 asking that married women be granted the right to their wages  and 4,000 venturing to be recorded for woman suffrage.    Enthusiastic over her Albany success, she impetuously wrote Lucy  Stone, \"Is this not a wonderful time, an era long to be  remembered?\"[47]    Although the legislature failed to act on the petitions, she knew that  her cause had made progress, for never before had women been listened  to with such respect and never had newspapers been so friendly. She  cherished these words of praise from Lucy, \"God bless you, Susan dear,  for the brave heart that will work on even in the midst of  discouragement and lack of helpers. Everywhere I am telling people  what your state is doing, and it is worth a great deal to the cause.  The example of positive action is what we need.\"[48]           *       *       *       *       *    Susan continued her \"example of positive action,\" this time against  the Kansas-Nebraska bill, pending in Congress, which threatened repeal  of the Missouri Compromise by admitting Kansas and Nebraska as  territories with the right to choose for themselves whether they  would be slave or free. \"I feel that woman should in the very capitol  of the nation lift her voice against that abominable measure,\" she  wrote Lucy Stone, with whom she was corresponding more and more  frequently. \"It is not enough that H. B. Stowe should write.\"[49]  Harriet Beecher Stowe's _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ had been published in 1852  and during that year 300,000 copies were sold.    [Illustration: Ernestine Rose]    With Ernestine Rose, Susan now headed for Washington. These two women  had been drawn together by common interests ever since they had met in  Syracuse in 1852. Susan was not frightened, as many were, by  Ernestine's reputed atheism. She appreciated Ernestine's intelligence,  her devotion to woman's rights, and her easy eloquence. Conscious of  her own limitations as an orator, she recognized her need of Ernestine  for the many meetings she planned for the future.    As they traveled to Washington together, she learned more about this  beautiful, impressive, black-haired Jewess from Poland, who was ten  years her senior. The daughter of a rabbi, Ernestine had found the  limitations of orthodox religion unbearable for a woman and had left  her home to see and learn more of the world in Prussia, Holland,  France, Scotland, and England. She had married an Englishman  sympathetic to her liberal views, and together they had come to New  York where she began her career as a lecturer in 1836 when speaking in  public branded women immoral. She spoke easily and well on education,  woman's rights, and the evils of slavery. Her slight foreign accent  added charm to her rich musical voice, and before long she was in  demand as far west as Ohio and Michigan. With a colleague as  experienced as Ernestine, Susan dared arrange for meetings even in the  capital of the nation.    Washington was tense over the slavery issue when they arrived, and  Ernestine's friends warned her not to mention the subject in her  lectures. Unheeding she commented on the Kansas-Nebraska bill, but the  press took no notice and her audiences showed no signs of  dissatisfaction. In fact, two comparatively unknown women, billed to  lecture on the \"Educational and Social Rights of Women\" and the  \"Political and Legal Rights of Women,\" attracted little attention in a  city accustomed to a blaze of Congressional oratory. Hoping to draw  larger audiences and to lend dignity to their meetings, Susan asked  for the use of the Capitol on Sunday, but was refused because  Ernestine was not a member of a religious society. Making an attempt  for Smithsonian Hall, Ernestine was told it could not risk its  reputation by presenting a woman speaker.[50]    A failure financially, their Washington venture was rich in  experience. Susan took time out for sightseeing, visiting the  \"President's house\" and Mt. Vernon, which to her surprise she found in  a state of \"delapidation and decay.\" \"The mark of slavery o'ershadows  the whole,\" she wrote in her diary. \"Oh the thought that it was here  that he whose name is the pride of this Nation, was the _Slave  Master_.\"[51]    Again and again in the Capitol, she listened to heated debates on the  Kansas-Nebraska bill, astonished at the eloquence and fervor with  which the \"institution of slavery\" could be defended. Seeing slavery  first-hand, she abhorred it more than ever and observed with dismay  its degenerating influence on master as well as slave. She began to  feel that even she herself might be undermined by it almost  unwittingly and confessed to her diary, \"This noon, I ate my dinner  without once asking myself are these human beings who minister to my  wants, Slaves to be bought and sold and hired out at the will of a  master?... Even I am getting _accustomed_ to _Slavery_ ... so much so  that I have ceased continually to be made to feel its blighting,  cursing influence.\"[52]           *       *       *       *       *    A few months later, Susan and Ernestine were in Philadelphia at a  national woman's rights convention, and when Ernestine was proposed  for president, Susan had her first opportunity to champion her new  friend. A foreigner and a free-thinker, Ernestine encountered a great  deal of prejudice even among liberal reformers, and Susan was  surprised at the strength of feeling against her. Impressed during  their trip to Washington by Ernestine's essentially fine qualities and  her value to the cause, Susan fought for her behind the scenes,  insisting that freedom of religion or the freedom to have no religion  be observed in woman's rights conventions, and she had the  satisfaction of seeing Ernestine elected to the office she so richly  deserved.    Freedom of religion or freedom to have no religion had become for  Susan a principle to hold on to, as she listened at these early  woman's rights meetings to the lengthy fruitless discussions regarding  the lack of Scriptural sanction for women's new freedom. Usually a  clergyman appeared on the scene, volubly quoting the Bible to prove  that any widening of woman's sphere was contrary to the will of God.  But always ready to refute him were Antoinette Brown, now an ordained  minister, William Lloyd Garrison, and occasionally Susan herself. To  the young Quaker broadened by her Unitarian contacts and unhampered by  creed or theological dogma, such debates were worse than useless; they  deepened theological differences, stirred up needless antagonisms,  solved no problems, and wasted valuable time.    During this convention, she was one of the twenty-four guests in  Lucretia Mott's comfortable home at 238 Arch Street. Every meal, with  its stimulating discussions, was a convention in itself."]]]
