The letters represented absolute pitch, and as, owing to  the variety of genera, modes and chroa, the total number of tones was  very large, parts of older forms of the alphabet were also employed,  the whole number of characters thus demanded being upwards of seventy.  There was little or no classification of tones, and the entire  twenty-four letters were applied in regular order to the diatonic  series of the Dorian mode. Tones in the chromatic or enharmonic modes  were named by other letters, and the system was extremely complicated.  The notes of the instrumental accompaniment were still different from  those of the vocal part. No genuine example of this music has come  down to us in reliable form, and curiously enough, no classical writer  gives any idea of the notation of music. All that we know of this  notation we derive from Alypius, who lived about 150 A.D. Athanasius  Kircher, a Jesuit of a monastery in Sicily, published in the last  century the text of what purported to be a fragment of the first  Pythic Ode of Pindar. (See page 69.) In the original the musical  characters stood in immediate proximity to the words of the text. At  the middle of the third line begins the chorus of Citharodists. As all  the musical characters of the Greeks indicated absolute pitch, the  student will discover the difference between the vocal and  instrumental notation by comparing the notes in the early part of the  ode with those of the same pitches noted for instruments later.    Three other pieces of similar apocryphal character have come down to  us. It is likely that these melodies, if not really genuine, as  related to the composition of Pindar, nevertheless belong to a period  a little anterior to the Christian era.

I.    Very important developments of the art of music took place in India  from a remote period, but dates are entirely uncertain. When the hymns  of the Rig-Veda were collected into their present form, which appears  to have been about 1500 B.C., music was highly esteemed. It was in  India that the art of inciting vibrations of a string by means of a  bow was discovered; and our violin had its origin there, but the date  is entirely unknown. The primitive violin was the ravanastron, which  the Ceylonese claim to have been invented by one of their kings, who  reigned about 5000 B.C. The form of this instrument is given in Fig.  16. It must have been some time before the Mohammedan invasion, for  they brought a rude violin back to Arabia, from whence it came into  Europe after the crusades. They had many forms of guitar, instruments  of percussion, and the varieties of viol, as well as trumpets and the  like. The national instrument was the vina. This was a sort of guitar,  its body made of a strip of bamboo about eight inches wide and four  feet long. Near each end a large gourd was fixed, for reinforcing the  resonance. In playing, it was held obliquely in front of the player,  like a guitar, one gourd resting upon the left shoulder, the other  under the right arm. It was strung with six strings of silk and wire,  and had a very elaborate apparatus of frets, much higher than those of  a guitar, many of them movable, in order to permit modulation into any  of the twenty-four Hindoo \"modes.\" The instrument had a light, thin  tone, not unpleasing. A fine specimen is figured in \"Hipkins' Plates  of Rare Instruments\" in the South Kensington Museum, a copy of which  may be seen in the Newberry Library.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.    JIWAN CHAH.    (Portrait of Jiwan Chah, one of the latest masters of the vina. He  died about 1790.)]    The Hindoos carried the theory of music to an extremely fine point,  having many curious scales, some of them with twenty-four divisions in  an octave. Twenty-two was the usual number. The pitch of each note in  every mode was accurately calculated mathematically, and the frets of  the vina located thereby, according to very old theoretical works by  one Soma, written in Sanskrit at least as early as 1500 B.C. When this  work first became known to Europeans, its elaboration led it to be  regarded as a purely theoretical fancy piece, and it was thought to be  impossible that practical musicians could have been governed by  theories apparently so fine-drawn. A study of the structure of the  vina, however, perfectly adapted to these theories, set all doubts at  rest. None of the intervals of the Hindoo scale exactly correspond to  our own. Harmony they never conceived. Well sounding chords are  impossible in their scales. All their music was monodic--one-voiced.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.]    There was a curious development of the musical drama in India about  300 B.C., having certain of the traits of modern opera. Several of  these ancient pieces have come down to us, but without the musical  notes. They are long, consisting of as many as eleven acts, part of  them sung, part spoken. Curiously enough, the different acts are not  all in the same dialect. The musical acts are in Sanskrit, which had  then ceased to be a spoken language for at least 500 years; the spoken  acts were in Pakrit, a dialect of Sanskrit, which likewise had ceased  to be spoken for several centuries. A fuller account of the Hindoo  drama is given in Wilson's \"Theater of the Hindoos.\" The curious  circumstance of the drama of the Hindoos of this epoch is that it was  contemporaneous with another very celebrated development of musical  drama in Greece.    Besides the primitive form of the bowed instrument, the ravanastron  (Fig. 16), many forms more advanced are figured among the instruments  from India in European museums, but as they are all of absurd and  impossible acoustical conception, besides being most likely of  comparatively modern origin, we do not present them at this point.  Later, in the history of the violin, one or two of the most curious  will be given.      II.    China has had an art of music from extremely remote periods, and  singularly sagacious ideas concerning the art were advanced there very  long ago, at a time when Europe and most other parts of the world were  still in the darkness of barbarism. For example: There is a saying of  the Emperor Tschun, about 2300 B.C., \"Teach the children of the great;  thereby reached through thy care they will become mild and  reasonable, and the unmanageable ones able to receive dignities  without arrogance or assumption. This teaching must thou embody in  poems, and sing them therewith to suitable melodies and with the play  of instrumental accompaniment. The music must follow the sense of the  words; if they are simple and natural then also must the music be  easy, unforced and without pretension. Music is the expression of  soul-feeling. If now the soul of the musician be virtuous, so also  will his music become noble and full of virtuous expression, and will  set the souls of men in union with those of the spirits in heaven.\"  (Quoted by Ambros.)    [Illustration: Fig. 17.]    The principal instruments of Chinese music are the Kin and the Ke. The  former is a sort of guitar, of which no illustration has come to hand.  The main instrument of their culture-music is the ke, a stringed  instrument entirely unlike any other of which we have accounts, saving  the Japanese ko-ko, which was most likely derived from it. The ke is  strung with fifty strings of silk. Originally it had but twenty-five,  but in the reign of Hoang-Ti, about 2637 B.C., it is said to have been  enlarged to its present dimensions and compass. The appearance of the  ke and the arrangement of its bridges are shown in Fig. 17. The  strings were plucked with the fingers.    In the earlier times the Chinese had the pentatonic scale,  approximately the same as that of the black keys of the piano. Later  it was enlarged to seven notes in the octave, and it is claimed by  some that long before the Christian era they had a complete chromatic  scale of twelve tones in the octave. The evidence upon this point,  however, is insufficient. And even if they had this musical resource  at so early a period the fact counts very little to their credit,  since at best the chromatic scale is only an impure harmonic  compromise, which they have never learned to use understandingly.  Chinese music has always been monodic, and they use a great variety of  melodic shadings composed of intervals of small fractions of a step.  These they call lu. There are movable bridges which can be placed in  such way as to divide the strings of the ke at proper "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2030"],[0,"Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition (#11)"],[1,"and twenty-five years.       Meskingasher entered into(1) (. . .) and ascended to (. .       .).         Enmerkar, son of Meskingasher, the king of Erech who built       (. . .) with the people of Erech,(2) ruled as king for four       hundred and twenty years.         Lugalbanda, the shepherd, ruled for twelve hundred years.         Dumuzi,(3), the hunter(?), whose city was . . ., ruled for a       hundred years.         Gishbilgames,(4) whose father was A,(5) the high priest of       Kullab, ruled for one hundred and twenty-six(6) years.         (. . .)lugal, son of Gishbilgames, ruled for (. . .) years.         (1) The verb may also imply descent into.         (2) The phrase appears to have been imperfectly copied by       the scribe. As it stands the subordinate sentence reads \"the       king of Erech who built with the people of Erech\". Either       the object governed by the verb has been omitted, in which       case we might restore some such phrase as \"the city\"; or,       perhaps, by a slight transposition, we should read \"the king       who built Erech with the people of Erech\". In any case the       first building of the city of Erech, as distinguished from       its ancient cult-centre Eanna, appears to be recorded here       in the tradition. This is the first reference to Erech in       the text; and Enmerkar's father was high priest as well as       king.         (3) i.e. Tammuz.         (4) i.e. Gilgamesh.         (5) The name of the father of Gilgamesh is rather strangely       expressed by the single sign for the vowel _a_ and must       apparently be read as A. As there is a small break in the       text at the end of this line, Dr. Poebel not unnaturally       assumed that A was merely the first syllable of the name, of       which the end was wanting. But it has now been shown that       the complete name was A; see Foertsch, _Orient. Lit.-Zeit._,       Vol. XVIII, No. 12 (Dec., 1915), col. 367 ff. The reading is       deduced from the following entry in an Assyrian explanatory       list of gods (_Cun. Texts in the Brit. Mus._, Pt. XXIV, pl.       25, ll. 29-31): \"The god A, who is also equated to the god       Dubbisaguri (i.e. 'Scribe of Ur'), is the priest of Kullab;       his wife is the goddess Ninguesirka (i.e. 'Lady of the edge       of the street').\" A, the priest of Kullab and the husband of       a goddess, is clearly to be identified with A, the priest of       Kullab and father of Gilgamesh, for we know from the       Gilgamesh Epic that the hero's mother was the goddess       Ninsun. Whether Ninguesirka was a title of Ninsun, or       represents a variant tradition with regard to the parentage       of Gilgamesh on the mother's side, we have in any case       confirmation of his descent from priest and goddess. It was       natural that A should be subsequently deified. This was not       the case at the time our text was inscribed, as the name is       written without the divine determinative.         (6) Possibly 186 years.    This group of early kings of Erech is of exceptional interest. Apart  from its inclusion of Gilgamesh and the gods Tammuz and Lugalbanda,  its record of Meskingasher's reign possibly refers to one of the lost  legends of Erech. Like him Melchizedek, who comes to us in a chapter of  Genesis reflecting the troubled times of Babylon's First Dynasty,(1)  was priest as well as king.(2) Tradition appears to have credited  Meskingasher's son and successor, Enmerkar, with the building of Erech  as a city around the first settlement Eanna, which had already given its  name to the \"kingdom\". If so, Sumerian tradition confirms the assumption  of modern research that the great cities of Babylonia arose around the  still more ancient cult-centres of the land. We shall have occasion  to revert to the traditions here recorded concerning the parentage of  Meskingasher, the founder of this line of kings, and that of its most  famous member, Gilgamesh. Meanwhile we may note that the closing rulers  of the \"Kingdom of Eanna\" are wanting. When the text is again preserved,  we read of the hegemony passing from Erech to Ur and thence to Awan:         The k(ingdom of Erech(3) passed to) Ur.       In Ur Mesannipada became king and ruled for eighty years.       Meskiagunna, son of Mesannipada, ruled for thirty years.       Elu(. . .) ruled for twenty-five years.       Balu(. . .) ruled for thirty-six years.       Four kings (thus) ruled for a hundred and seventy-one years.       The kingdom of Ur passed to Awan.       In Awan . . .         (1) Cf. _Hist. of Bab._, p. 159 f.         (2) Gen. xiv. 18.         (3) The restoration of Erech here, in place of Eanna, is       based on the absence of the latter name in the summary;       after the building of Erech by Enmerkar, the kingdom was       probably reckoned as that of Erech.    With the \"Kingdom of Ur\" we appear to be approaching a firmer historical  tradition, for the reigns of its rulers are recorded in decades, not  hundreds of years. But we find in the summary, which concludes the main  copy of our Dynastic List, that the kingdom of Awan, though it consisted  of but three rulers, is credited with a total duration of three hundred  and fifty-six years, implying that we are not yet out of the legendary  stratum. Since Awan is proved by newly published historical inscriptions  from Nippur to have been an important deity of Elam at the time of the  Dynasty of Akkad,(1) we gather that the \"Kingdom of Awan\" represented in  Sumerian tradition the first occasion on which the country passed for a  time under Elamite rule. At this point a great gap occurs in the text,  and when the detailed dynastic succession in Babylonia is again assured,  we have passed definitely from the realm of myth and legend into that of  history.(2)         (1) Poebel, _Hist. Inscr._, p. 128.         (2) See further, Appendix II.    What new light, then, do these old Sumerian records throw on Hebrew  traditions concerning the early ages of mankind? I think it will be  admitted that there is something strangely familiar about some of those  Sumerian extracts I read just now. We seem to hear in them the faint  echo of another narrative, like them but not quite the same.         And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and       thirty years; and he died.         And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enosh:       and Seth lived after he begat Enosh eight hundred and seven       years, and begat sons and daughters: and all the days of       Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.         . . . and all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five       years: and he died.         . . . and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten       years: and he died. . . . and all the days of Mahalalel were       eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.         . . . and all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and       two years: and he died.         . . . and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and       five years: and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for       God took him.         . . . and all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty       and nine years: and he died.         . . . and all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy       and seven years: and he died.         And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem,       Ham, and Japheth.    Throughout these extracts from \"the book of the generations of Adam\",(1)  Galumum's nine hundred years(2) seem to run almost like a refrain; and  Methuselah's great age, the recognized symbol for longevity, is even  exceeded by two of the Sumerian patriarchs. The names in the two lists  are not the same,(3) but in both we are moving in the same atmosphere  and along similar lines of thought. Though each list adheres to its own  set formulae, it estimates the length of human life in the early ages  of the world on much the same gigantic scale as the other. Our Sumerian  records are not quite so formal in their structure as the Hebrew  narrative, but the short notes which here and there relieve their stiff  monotony may be paralleled in the Cainite genealogy of the preceding  chapter in Genesis.(4) There Cain's city-building, for example, may pair  with that of Enmerkar; and though our new records may afford no precise  equivalents to Jabal's patronage of nomad life, or to the invention of  music and metal-working ascribed to Jubal and Tubal-cain, these too  are quite in the spirit of Sumerian and Babylonian tradition, in their  attempt to picture the beginnings of civilization. Thus Enmeduranki,  the prototype of the seventh Antediluvian patriarch of Berossus, was  traditionally revered as the first exponent of divination.(5) It is in  the chronological and general setting, rather than in the Hebrew names  and details, that an echo seems here to reach us from Sumer through  Babylon.         (1) Gen. v. 1 ff. (P).         (2) The same length of reign is credited to Melamkish and to       one and perhaps two other rulers of that first Sumerian       \"kingdom\".         (3) The possibility of the Babylonian origin of some of the       Hebrew names in this geneaology and its Cainite parallel has       long been canvassed; and considerable ingenuity has been       expended in obtaining equations between Hebrew names and       those of the Antediluvian kings of Berossus by tracing a       common meaning for each suggested pair. It is unfortunate       that our new identification of {'Ammenon} with the Sumerian       _Enmenunna_ should dispose of one of the best parallels       obtained, viz. {'Ammenon} = Bab. _ummanu_, \"workman\" ||       Cain, Kenan = \"smith\". Another satisfactory pair suggested       is {'Amelon} = Bab. _amelu_, \"man\" || Enosh = \"man\"; but the       resemblance of the former to _amelu_ may prove to be       fortuitous, in view of the possibility of descent from a       quite different Sumerian original.
