The two princes and the princess had prepared a magnificent repast for  the emperor and queen and their court. As soon as that was over, the  emperor led the queen into the garden, and shewed her the Harmonious  Tree and the beautiful effect of the Golden Fountain. She had seen the  Bird in his cage, and the emperor had spared no panegyric in his praise  during the repast.    When there was nothing to detain the emperor any longer, he took horse,  and with the Princes Bahman and Perviz on his right hand, and the queen  consort and the princess at his left, preceded and followed by all the  officers of his court, according to their rank, returned to his capital.  Crowds of people came out to meet them, and with acclamations of joy  ushered them into the city, where all eyes were fixed not only upon the  queen, and her royal children, but also upon the Bird, which the  princess carried before her in his cage, admiring his sweet notes, which  had drawn all the other birds about him, and followed him flying from  tree to tree in the country, and from one house top to another in the  city. The Princes Bahman and Perviz and the Princess Periezade were at  length brought to the palace with pomp, and nothing was to be seen or  heard all that night but illuminations and rejoicings both in the palace  and in the utmost parts of the city, which lasted many days, and were  continued throughout the empire of Persia, as intelligence of the joyful  event reached the several provinces.          THE STORY OF THE FISHERMAN AND THE GENIE      There was once an aged fisherman who was so poor that he could scarcely  earn as much as would maintain himself, his wife, and three children. He  went every day to fish betimes in the morning, and imposed it as a law  upon himself not to cast his nets above four times a day. He went one  morning by moonlight, and coming to the seaside, undressed himself, and  cast in his nets. As he drew them toward the shore, he found them very  heavy, and thought he had a good draught of fish, at which he rejoiced;  but a moment after, perceiving that instead of fish his net contained  nothing but the carcass of an ass, he was much vexed.    When he had mended his nets, which the carcass of the ass had broken in  several places, he threw them in a second time; and when he drew them,  found a great deal of resistance, which made him think he had taken  abundance of fish; but he found nothing except a basket full of gravel  and slime, which grieved him extremely. \"O Fortune!\" cried he, with a  lamentable tone, \"be not angry with me, nor persecute a wretch who prays  thee to spare him. I came hither from my house to seek for my  livelihood, and thou pronouncest against me a sentence of death. I have  no other trade but this to subsist by, and, notwithstanding all my care,  I can scarcely provide what is necessary for my family. But I am to  blame to complain of thee; thou takest pleasure to persecute honest  people, and advancest those who have no virtue to recommend them.\"    Having finished this complaint, he fretfully threw away the basket, and,  washing his nets from the slime, cast them a third time, but brought up  nothing except stones, shells, and mud. No language can express his  disappointment; he was almost distracted. However, when day began to  appear, he did not forget to say his prayers like a good Mussulman, and  he added to them this petition: \"Lord, thou knowest that I cast my nets  only four times a day; I have already drawn them three times, without  the least reward for my labour: I am only to cast them once more; I pray  thee to render the sea favourable to me, as thou didst to Moses.\"    The fisherman, having finished this prayer, cast his nets the fourth  time; and when he thought it was proper, drew them as formerly with  great difficulty; but instead of fish found nothing in them but a vessel  of yellow copper, which, from its weight, seemed not to be empty; and he  observed that it was fastened and closed with lead, having the  impression of a seal upon it. This turn of fortune rejoiced him: \"I will  sell it,\" said he, \"to the founder, and with the money buy a measure of  corn.\" He examined the vessel on all sides, and shook it to see if its  contents made any noise, but heard nothing. This circumstance, with the  impression of the seal upon the cover, made him think it enclosed  something precious. To try this, he took a knife and opened it with very  little labour. He turned the mouth downward, but nothing came out, which  surprised him extremely. He placed it before him, but while he viewed it  attentively, there burst forth a very thick smoke, which obliged him to  retire two or three paces back.    The smoke ascended to the clouds, and, extending itself along the sea  and upon the shore, formed a great mist, which filled the fisherman  with astonishment. When the smoke was all out of the vessel, it  reunited, and became a solid body, of which was formed a genie twice as  high as the greatest of giants. At the sight of such a monster the  fisherman would fain have fled, but was so frightened that he could not  move.    \"Solomon,\" cried the genie immediately, \"Solomon, the great prophet,  pardon, pardon; I will never more oppose your will, I will obey all your  commands.\"    The fisherman, when he heard these words of the genie, recovered his  courage and said to him: \"Thou proud spirit, what is it you say? It is  above eighteen hundred years since the prophet Solomon died, and we are  now at the end of time. Tell me your history, and how you came to be  shut up in this vessel.\"    The genie, turning to the fisherman with a fierce look, said: \"Thou must  address me with more courtesy; thou art a presumptuous fellow to call me  a proud spirit; speak to me more respectfully, or I will kill thee.\"  \"Ah!\" replied the fisherman, \"why should you kill me? Did I not just now  set you at liberty, and have you already forgotten my services?\"    \"No, I remember it,\" said the genie, \"but that shall not save thy life:  I have only one favour to grant thee.\" \"And what is that?\" asked the  fisherman. \"It is,\" answered the genie, \"to give thee thy choice in what  manner thou wouldst have me put thee to death.\" \"But wherein have I  offended you?\" demanded the fisherman. \"Is that your reward for the  service I have rendered you?\" \"I cannot treat thee otherwise,\" said the  genie; \"and that thou mayest know the reason, hearken to my story.\"    \"I am one of those rebellious spirits that opposed the will of Solomon,  the son of David, and to avenge himself, that monarch sent Asaph, the  son of Barakhia, his chief minister, to apprehend me. Asaph seized  my person, and brought me by force before his master's throne.    \"Solomon commanded me to acknowledge his power, and to submit to his  commands. I bravely refused, and told him I would rather expose myself  to his resentment, than swear fealty as he required. To punish me, he  shut me up in this copper vessel; and that I might not break my prison,  he himself stamped upon this leaden cover his seal with the great name  of God engraven upon it. He then gave the vessel to one of the genies  who had submitted, with orders to throw me into the sea.    \"During the first hundred years of my imprisonment, I swore that if any  one should deliver me before the expiration of that period, I would make  him rich, even after his death; but that century ran out, and nobody did  me the good office. During the second, I made an oath that I would open  all the treasures of the earth to any one that might set me at liberty;  but with no better success. In the third, I promised to make my  deliverer a potent monarch, and to grant him every day three requests,  of what nature soever they might be; but this century passed as well as  the two former, and I continued in prison. At last, being angry to find  myself a prisoner so long, I swore that if afterward any one should  deliver me, I would kill him without mercy, and grant him no favour but  to choose the manner of his death; and, therefore, since thou hast  delivered me to-day, I give thee that choice.\"    [Illustration]    _The smoke ascended to the clouds, and extending itself along the sea  and upon the shore formed a great mist._    This discourse afflicted the fisherman extremely: \"I am very  unfortunate,\" cried he, \"to come hither to do such a kindness to one  that is so ungrateful. I beg you to consider your injustice, and revoke  such an unreasonable oath; pardon me, and Heaven will pardon you; if you  grant me my life, Heaven will protect you from all attempts against your  own.\" \"No, thy death is resolved on,\" said the genie, \"only choose in  what manner thou wilt die.\" The fisherman, perceiving the genie to be  resolute, was extremely grieved, not so much for himself, as on account  of his three children, and bewailed the misery they must be reduced to  by his death. He endeavoured still to appease the genie, and said,  \"Alas! be pleased to take pity on me, in consideration of the service I  have done you.\" \"I have told thee already,\" replied the genie, \"it is  for that very reason I must kill thee.\" \"That is strange,\" said the  fisherman, \"are you resolved to reward good with evil? The proverb truly  says, 'He who does good to one who deserves it not, is always ill  rewarded.'\" \"Do not lose time,\" interrupted the genie; \"all thy  chattering shall not divert me from my purpose; make haste, and tell me  what kind of death thou preferrest?\"    Necessity is the mother of invention. The fisherman bethought himself of  a stratagem. \"Since I must die then,\" said he to the genie, \"I submit to  the will of Heaven; but before I choose the manner of my death, I  conjure you, by the great name which was engraven upon the seal of the  prophet Solomon, to answer me truly the question I am"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20924"],[0,"Ely Cathedral (#11)"],[1,"Elkanah and Hannah; Samuel       praying; Samuel called; Samuel telling his vision to Eli--by       Messrs.

Sparke.    A tablet on the wall, near the eastern window of this aisle, bears the  following inscription:--              \"1676,        _Roger Clopton,      Rector of Downham,   Gave two hundred pounds,  By which The greatest Part     of the Nave of This         Church Was           paved._\"    The Nave and aisles do not now require a gift of this kind, having  been recently paved at considerable expense, but the floor of the  Octagon, South Transept, and Choir aisles will require a large sum to  complete them, and if some kind friends will follow the example of  Roger Clopton it will indeed be a timely benefaction, and now very  much to be desired as an important step towards the completion of the  work of restoration.    Before examining the Octagon we will make some observations on    +The Great Transept.+    This includes both arms, although for distinction it is frequently  spoken of as the north and south Transept. This is the oldest portion  of the Cathedral, having been begun by Abbot Simeon A.D. 1083, of  whose work, however, but little more than the ground story remains.  Before the fall of the Norman Tower in 1322, each arm was longer by  one bay, which is now included in the plan of the Octagon, in the same  manner as the Nave. Both arms have aisles, but those of the south, and  one in the north, are enclosed for various purposes. In each arm there  is a simple cylindrical shaft, of which no other specimen occurs in  any other part of the church. The capitals of the columns and the  arches above the lower tier are similar to those of the Nave. The roof  in both is of bare rafters with rich cornices, painted with flowers  and devices, and angels with wings expanded under the principals;  both arms have recently undergone a thorough repair, the rafters and  cornices have been re-painted and gilded in their original style,  which, with the stained glass lately inserted in the windows, produces  an amount of colour the effect of which is very striking.    We will first refer for details to the north arm; of which the western  aisle is open, and is lighted by three Norman windows, all of which  have been recently filled with stained glass:         The south window--executed by M. Lusson, of Paris; the       subjects taken from the Parables; as a memorial of the Rev.       A. Moore, of Walpole, who designed and executed three       windows in the Cathedral.         The middle window, by the same artist; subject, the Good       Samaritan: given by John Muriel, Esq.         The northern window was executed by the Rev. A. Moore; the       subject taken from the parable of the Prodigal Son.    At the north end of the Transept is a small colonnade, the arches of  which are irregular, those opposite the lower windows being higher  than the others to allow free passage to the light. At the north-east  corner is a doorway communicating with a staircase leading to the  upper parts of the church. In the year 1699 the fall of a portion of  the north-west corner took place, but it was so well rebuilt as not to  be discernable in the interior. The windows in the triforium on the  east side are original; those of the triforium on the west side, and  the upper ones at the north end, are Perpendicular insertions; the  rest are all in their original form, or have been restored to it;  those in the north end have been filled with stained glass:         The two lower, and the western window of the second tier, by       Mr. Wailes, at the cost of the late Canon E.B. Sparke.         The eastern window of the second tier, by the Rev. A. Moore.       The subjects of these four windows are incidents in the       history of St. Paul.         The windows in the upper tier--by Messrs. Ward and       Hughes--also at the cost of the late Canon E.B. Sparke,       contain figures of eminent persons in New Testament history,       with arms, &c. in the tracery. Those in the western window       represent Silas; Clement, bishop; Apollos; Judas Barsabas;       Dionysius, areopagite; and Philip, deacon: in the eastern       window, Titus, bishop; St. Paul; Timothy; St. Mark; St.       Barnabas; and St. Luke.    The eastern aisle is divided by walls behind the columns into  compartments; the northern one forms a communication with the entrance  to the Lady Chapel; the middle one a vestry for the Grammar Scholars;  and the third a vestry for the Lay-Clerks; remains of fresco paintings  may be seen on the walls of both these compartments.         The stained glass window in the middle compartment contains       subjects from the history of our Saviour; executed by       Messrs. Clayton and Bell: presented by--Heywood, Esq., as a       memorial to his mother.         The window in the third compartment, by the same artists,       represents the Entombment and the Ascension, and is the gift       of C.L. Higgins, Esq., of Turvey Abbey.    The floor of this portion has been recently re-laid by the munificence  of the late Canon E.B. Sparke.    We now cross the Octagon (which we will examine afterwards) to the  south arm of the Transept. At the south end is a colonnade, but  differing in design to that in the north arm, the arches being all of  equal height, but not so high as the others; over these is a row of  intersecting arches. It is probable that these galleries were added at  a period subsequent to the erection of the Transept, and intended as a  means of communication from one triforium to the other; in the south  east corner is a staircase leading to the triforium. Some remains of  ancient decoration may be observed on the walls and capitals, portions  of which have been renewed.    The eastern aisle was formerly divided by a wall behind each column  into three compartments, with wooden screens in front; but these were  all removed in 1814, when it was enclosed as we now see it to form the  Library, which is lighted on the east by three Early English windows,  and on the south by a Norman one. The western aisle appears to have  been closed for many years, as on the walls built in the arches (and  which until lately completely filled the openings,) there is an arcade  of intersecting Norman arches. Of this aisle, thus inclosed, one  portion is used as a vestry by the Vergers, having an entrance from  the south aisle of the Nave; the remaining portion as a vestry for the  Clergy. The carved oak door to this vestry deserves attention; it is  not exactly known whether it originally belonged to the Cathedral, the  carved devices are similar to those in the chapel of Bishop Alcock, in  the north aisle of the Choir; there is no doubt that it belonged to  some building erected by that prelate, if not to this, probably to the  chapel of Jesus College, Cambridge, of which Bishop Alcock was the  founder. It was found at Landbeach, and sent to the Cathedral by Canon  Fardell.    The windows of the western aisle and those of the clerestory on both  sides are in their original form, and so are those of the two lower  tiers at the south end, but the others are of later age; in the gable  is a low window of seven lights, very different to the upper windows  in the north arm: those in the south end and two in the western aisle  have been filled with stained glass:         The eastern window of the lower tier of the south end, by M.       Henri Gerente, contains incidents in the history of Joseph;       presented by the late Canon E.B. Sparke.         The western window by the same artist, contains incidents       from the history of Moses: contributed by some of the then       Lessees under the Bishop.         The eastern window of the second tier, by Messrs. Henri and       Alfred Gerente, contains subjects from the history of       Abraham, with parallels: the gift of Incumbents of livings       in the diocese, and in the patronage of the Bishop.         The western window, by M. Alfred Gerente, contains subjects       from the history of Jacob; the gift of Incumbents of livings       formerly in the "]]]
