Dick  Maitland's possessions were so few that they needed very little packing  to prepare them for transit from ship to shore, and when he had finished  he adjourned to Grosvenor's cabin to assist that gentleman, who, since  dispensing with the services of a valet, seemed quite incapable of  replacing his possessions in the receptacles from which he had taken  them upon the beginning of the voyage.  The remainder of the day was  passed in the animated discussion of future plans and arrangements,  while one effect of the imminent termination of the long ocean voyage  was the sudden development of an amazing access of cordiality between  people who had hitherto manifested but little interest in each other,  accompanied by pressing invitations to \"come and stay a few days at my  place whenever you happen to be in the neighbourhood\".  Also a few of  the more enthusiastic occupants of the cuddy remained on deck until  midnight, in the hope of catching a glimpse of the Bluff light before  turning in, only to retire to their cabins, discontented and grumbling,  because at eight bells the gleam still obstinately refused to appear on  the horizon over the port bow, where Mr Sutcliffe, the chief mate, had  been anxiously watching for it.    But full compensation came to the disappointed ones when, awakened on  the following morning about six o'clock by the voice of the mate issuing  certain sharp orders from the poop, followed by the flinging down of  ropes upon the deck and the cheery \"yo ho's\" of the sailors, as they  threw their weight upon various portions of the ship's running gear, the  said disappointed ones leaped from their bunks and hastened out on deck  clad only in pyjamas and overcoats; for they found the ship hove-to on  the starboard tack with her head to the eastward, while stretching away  astern of them, from the starboard to the port quarter, was the  dominating eminence of the Bluff, bush-clad from base to crest, crowned  with its lighthouse and signal staff--from the latter of which was  fluttering the answering pennant, acknowledging the deciphering of the  _Concordia's_ number--with the long breakwater jutting out into the sea  from its foot, while, nearer at hand, there stretched across the scene  the low outline of the Point, also bush-crowned, with the roofs of a few  houses and a flagstaff or two showing above the verdure, the sandy  beach, with the eternal surf thundering upon it in long lines of rainbow  spray, reaching for mile after mile athwart the ship's stern, and for  background the far-stretching ridge of the bush-clad, villa-studded  range of the Berea, the windows of its houses already ablaze with the  ardent beams of the newly risen sun.  The prospect is a charming one at  any time, but never more so perhaps than when it is suddenly presented,  fresh, green, and beautiful, in the clear atmosphere and the light of  early morning, to the vision of those whose eyes, after seventy days of  gazing upon sky and sea, are yearning to behold once more the beauties  of the solid earth.    For a full hour the ship remained hove-to with her head to seaward,  during which an early breakfast was served to the occupants of the  cuddy; then, upon the appearance of the tug coming out over the bar, the  _Concordia_ wore round and headed inshore, the light sails were rapidly  clewed up or hauled down, the towline was got ready for passing, and in  a moment everything was bustle and apparent confusion upon the ship's  decks, barefooted seamen rushing hither and thither, flinging down coils  of rope on deck, casting off halyards and sheets, and dragging  vociferously upon clew-garnets, clewlines, downhauls, and the other  complicated paraphernalia of a ship's furniture, with the captain  shouting orders from the poop, and the mate in charge of a gang of men  on the forecastle getting the anchor a-cockbill ready for letting go,  and preparing for the arrival of the tug alongside.  Then up came the  little steamer, rolling and pitching heavily upon the long ground swell,  sweeping round in a long curve that brought her all but alongside the  wallowing ship; a brief interchange of hails between her bridge and the  _Concordia's_ poop, the sudden snaking out of a whirling heaving-line  from the forecastle of the latter, followed by the thin but tremendously  strong steel towing hawser; and as the few remaining sheets of the  ship's canvas shrivelled in to the masts and yards the tug passed ahead,  the towrope rose dripping out of the water, tautened to the semblance of  a metal rod, and away went the two craft, heading for the middle of the  space of water that divided the two breakwaters.  Half an hour later the  _Concordia_ came to an anchor in the spacious but shallow inner harbour  opposite the railway station, and the long voyage was at an end.    But the eager passengers were not yet at liberty to go on shore.  Although the _Concordia_ carried a clean bill of health, certain  formalities had yet to be gone through; the medical officer had still to  satisfy himself that there was no sickness of any infectious kind on  board before pratique was granted.  And, as the medical officer happened  to be a thoroughly conscientious man, the determination of this fact  consumed a full hour.  But at length the tedious examination came to an  end, the ship was pronounced perfectly healthy, and the boats which had  been hovering round her were permitted to come alongside.  Then ensued a  few minutes of strenuous bargaining between passengers and boatmen, at  the end of which time Dick and Grosvenor, having said goodbye to the  captain and officers--Dick also included the crew in his farewell--found  themselves being pulled across the few yards of water which intervened  between ship and shore, and presently they stood upon the sun-blistered  wharf fighting their way through an odoriferous crowd of shouting,  laughing, gesticulating, and more than half-naked Kafir rickshaw-men who  clamoured for the honour of dragging them the mile or so that separated  the Point from Durban.  But the Custom House officers had first to be  placated, and Grosvenor disgustedly found himself obliged to disburse a  goodly sum as duty upon his firearms and ammunition before he was  permitted to retain possession of them.  At length, however, the Customs  barrier was successfully negotiated; and then Dick in one rickshaw,  Grosvenor in another, and their baggage in a third, the two friends  proceeded in triumph along the bush-bordered road, over the level  crossing of the railway, and so up Smith Street to the Royal Hotel,  where they purposed to put up for a day or two, and where, upon their  arrival, they joined their fellow passengers at a hilarious second  breakfast in accordance with an arrangement made at the cabin table a  few hours earlier.        CHAPTER FIVE.    THE BEGINNING OF THE ADVENTURE.    The second breakfast over, farewells were spoken--with, in some cases,  the promise to meet again speedily--and the voyagers separated, some to  make their way home to their sugar or coffee estates in the  neighbourhood, others to take train to more distant localities, some  three or four being bound as far afield as Johannesburg or Pretoria--and  Dick, with his friend Grosvenor, set out to wander about the town of  Durban, inspect the shops, pass through the aristocratic quarter of the  Berea, per tram, and finally, on a couple of horses hired from the hotel  stable, to ride out to the River Umgeni, and thence to Sea Cow Lake, in  the vain hope of getting a sight of a few of the hippopotami that were  said to still haunt that piece of water; finally returning to the hotel  in time for dinner, hot, tired, but supremely happy, and delighted with  everything that they had seen.    During the progress of the meal they made the acquaintance of a Mr  Gerald Muspratt, a coffee planter, whose estate was situate some twelve  miles distant, in the adjoining county of Victoria; and, the  acquaintance ripening over the after-dinner coffee, with that breathless  celerity which is one of the most charming characteristics of the  Colonies, before retiring for the night the two friends had accepted  Muspratt's very pressing invitation to ride out with him to his place  next morning, and spend a couple of days there with him to look round  the estate and be introduced to Muspratt's two or three neighbours.  This they did in due course, the two days' visit lengthening itself into  four, and ending by the acceptance of another invitation, this time from  a sugar planter whose estate, Mount Pleasant, was situate some fourteen  miles farther up the coast, on the other side of the Umhloti River.  This invitation Dick would fain have declined, for he was impatient to  begin the real business that lay before them; but Grosvenor was so  charmed with the country and everything that he saw in it, and  especially with the spontaneous kindness, friendliness, and hospitality  of its people, that he seemed in no hurry to rush away from it all and  bury himself in the wilderness.  As it happened, neither of the young  men had any reason to regret the time thus spent, for their host, an  old-time transport rider, named Mitchell, had penetrated far beyond the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21070"],[0,"A Middy of the Slave Squadron: A West African Story (#11)"],[1,"me.\"    \"Of course,\" agreed the skipper.  \"And did you succeed in getting  everybody ashore safely?\"    \"Yes, thank God!\" answered Purchase fervently.  \"We are all safe and  sound, and very little the worse for our adventure, thus far.\"    \"Ah! that at least is good news,\" remarked Perry.  \"Well,\" he continued,  \"there is one very melancholy duty demanding our immediate attention,  Mr Purchase, namely, the interment of Captain Harrison and the other  poor fellow who fell during the attack upon the barracoon to-day.  I  will see about that matter personally, by choosing a suitable spot and  getting the graves dug, for we shall soon have the darkness upon us.  Meanwhile, you will be good enough to get tents rigged and such other  preparations made as may be possible for the comfort of all hands, and  especially the wounded, during the coming night; for we have all had a  very trying day, and it is imperative that we should secure a good  night's rest.  Mr Fortescue, come with me, if you please.\"    Now, during the progress of the foregoing conversation the boat party  had not been idle; for, as soon as the fact of the wreck had become  known to them, Mr Hoskins, the third lieutenant, seeing how matters  stood, had grappled with the situation by causing the guns, ammunition,  and stores of all kinds to be landed from the boats, and the craft  themselves to be hauled up high and dry upon the beach on the river-side  of the sand spit; and then, leading his men over the ridge, to where the  others were at work upon the salving of wreckage from the surf, he had  detailed a party to pick out from among the pile of heterogeneous  articles such things as were most needed to meet our more immediate  wants, and carry or drag them up the slope to the spot which Henderson,  the surgeon, had already selected as the most suitable spot for a camp.    It was toward this party that Mr Perry and I now directed our steps;  and when we had joined it the skipper, picking out a dozen of the most  handy men, gave them instructions to provide themselves with tools of  some sort suitable for the purpose of digging a couple of graves in the  loose, yielding sand above the level of high-water mark; and while they  were doing this, under my supervision, my companion wandered away by  himself in search of a suitable site for the graves.  As a matter of  fact there was very little in the nature of choice, the entire spit, or  at least that portion of it which we occupied, consisting of loose sand,  sparsely covered, along the ridge and far a few yards on either side of  it, with a kind of creeper with thick, tough, hairy stems and large,  broad leaves, the upper surface of which bristled with hairy spicules  about a quarter of an inch long.  This plant, it was evident, bound the  otherwise loose drifts and into a sufficiently firm condition to resist  the perpetual scouring action of the wind; it was in this portion of the  spit, therefore, that Mr Perry gave orders for the two graves to be  dug; and presently my little gang of twelve were busily engaged in  scooping out two holes, some twenty feet apart, to serve as graves.  They were obliged to work with such tools as came to hand, and these  consisted of splintered pieces of plank, the boats' balers, and some  wooden buckets that had come ashore.    Under such circumstances the task of excavation was distinctly  difficult, the more so that the sand ran back into the holes almost as  fast as it was scooped up and thrown out; but at length, by dint of  strenuous labour, a depth of some three feet was reached just as the  sun's rim touched the western horizon and flung a trail of blood athwart  the tumble of waters that lay between.  Then, the exigencies of the  occasion admitting of no further delay, the task was suspended; all  hands knocked off work; and, the bodies having meanwhile been enclosed  in rough coffins very hastily put together by the carpenter and his  mate, we all fell in; the gig's crew shouldered the late captain's  coffin, while six of his mates acted as bearers to the other dead man;  and, with Mr Perry leading the way and reading the burial service from  a prayer-book, which it appeared he always carried about with him, we  marched, slowly, solemnly, and bare-headed, up the slope of the sand  spit to the spot which had been selected for the last resting-place of  the dead.  Arrived there, the two coffins were at once deposited in  their respective graves, when the new captain, standing between the two  holes, somewhat hurriedly completed the ritual--for the light was fading  fast; whereupon, after bestowing a final parting glance at the rough,  uncouth box which concealed our beloved chief's body, we all turned  slowly and reluctantly away to retrace our steps back to the apology for  a camp which was to shelter us for the night, leaving a fresh party of  workers to fill in the graves.    In neither arm of the British fighting service do men unduly dwell upon  the loss of fallen comrades, for it is quite justly held that the man  who yields up his life in the service of his country has done a glorious  thing, whether he falls in a pitched battle deciding the fate of an  empire, or in some such obscure and scarcely chronicled event as the  attack upon a slave factory.  He is, where such is possible, laid in his  last resting-place with all the honourable observance that circumstances  permit, and his memory is cherished in the hearts of his comrades; but  whether his fame pass with the echo of the last volley fired over his  grave, or outlives the brass of the tablet which records his name and  deeds, there is no room for grief.  Wherefore, when we got back to camp  and had made the best possible arrangements for the coming night, there  was little reference in our conversation to the tragic events of the  past twenty-four hours; Mr Perry took up the reins of government, and  matters proceeded precisely as they would have done had Captain Harrison  been still alive and among us.    Our \"camp\" was, naturally, an exceedingly primitive affair; our living  and sleeping quarters consisting simply of sails cut from the yards and  stretched over such supports as could be contrived by inserting the  lower ends of spars or planks in the sand and lashing their upper ends  together.  These structures we dignified with the name of \"tents.\"  The  exigencies of the situation did not permit of the observance of such  nice distinctions of rank in the matter of accommodation as exist under  ordinary conditions, it therefore came about that we of the midshipmen's  berth were lodged for the night in the same tent as the ward-room  officers, and consequently we heard much of the conversation that passed  between them, particularly at dinner.  This meal--consisting of boiled  salt beef and pork, with a few sweet potatoes, and a \"duff\" made of  flour, damaged by sea water, with a few currants and raisins dotted  about here and there in it--was served upon the _Psyche's_ mizzen royal  stretched upon the bare sand in the centre of our \"tent\"; and we partook  of it squatted round the sail cross-legged on the sand, finding the way  to our mouths by the light of four ship's lanterns symmetrically  arranged one at each corner of the sail.    Naturally enough, Mr Purchase--now ranking as first lieutenant _vice_  Mr Perry, acting captain--having told the tale of the happenings which  had resulted in our becoming castaways, was anxious to hear full  particulars of what had befallen the boat expedition; and this Mr Perry  proceeded to relate to him as we sat round the \"table.\"  When he had  finished there was silence for a moment; then Purchase looked up and  said--    \"Don't you think it very strange that your experiences throughout should  have accorded so ill with the information that Captain Harrison acquired  at so much trouble and personal risk?  Hitherto it has always happened  that such information as he has been able to pick up has proved to be  accurate in every particular.\"    \"Yes,\" agreed Mr Perry, \"it has.  I've been thinking a good deal about  that to-day; and the opinion I have arrived at is that Harrison played  the game once too often, with this result--\" and he waved his right hand  comprehensively about him, indicating the tent, the makeshift dinner,  and our condition generally.    \"What I mean is this,\" he continued, in reply to Purchase's glance of  inquiry.  \"The poor old _Psyche_, as we all know, was a phenomenally  slow ship, yet her successes, since she came on the Coast, have been  greater and more brilliant than those of any other vessel belonging to  the squadron.  And why?  Because she had a trick of always turning up on  the right spot at the right moment.  Now it seems to me that this  peculiarity of hers can scarcely have escaped the notice of the slave-  trading fraternity, because it was so very marked.  I imagine that they  must often have wondered by what means we gained our information; and  when at length the thing had become so unmistakable as to provoke both  conjecture and discussion it would not take them long to arrive at a  very shrewd suspicion of the truth.  When once the matter had reached  this stage discovery could not possibly be very long delayed.  Captain  Harrison was undoubtedly a well-known figure in Sierra Leone; he was of  so striking a personality that it could not be otherwise, and I am of  opinion that at length his disguise was penetrated.  He was recognised  in one of those flash places in Freetown that are especially patronised  by individuals of shady and doubtful character; and a scheme was devised  for his and our undoing which has succeeded only too well.  In a word, I  believe that the whole of the information upon which he acted when  arranging this most unfortunate expedition was carefully fabricated for  the express purpose of bringing about the destruction of the ship, and  was confided to him by some one who had recognised"]]]
