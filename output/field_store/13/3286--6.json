Much the best  would it be for us if the tomahawks left the hands that were drawn back  to throw, if the knives that were flourished in our faces should be  buried to the haft in our hearts; and so we courted death, striving with  word and look to infuriate our executioners to the point of forgetting  their former purpose in the passion for instant vengeance. It was not to  be. The werowance spoke again, pointing to the hills which were dimly  seen through the mist. A moment, and the hands clenched upon the weapons  fell; another, and we were upon the march.    As one man, the village swept through the forest toward the rising  ground that was but a few bowshots away. The young men bounded ahead to  make the preparation; but the approved warriors and the old men went  more sedately, and with them walked Diccon and I, as steady of step as  they. The women and children for the most part brought up the rear,  though a few impatient hags ran past us. One of these women bore a great  burning torch, the flame and smoke streaming over her shoulder as she  ran. Others carried pieces of bark heaped with the [v]slivers of pine of  which every wigwam has store.    The sun was yet to rise when we reached a hollow amongst the low red  hills. The place was a natural amphitheater, well fitted for a  spectacle. Those Indians who could not crowd into the narrow level  spread themselves over the rising ground and looked down with fierce  laughter upon the driving of the stakes which the young men had brought.  The women and children scattered into the woods beyond the cleft between  the hills and returned bearing great armfuls of dry branches. Taunting  laughter, cries of savage triumph, the shaking of rattles, and the  furious beating of two great drums combined to make a clamor deafening  me to stupor. Above the horizon was the angry reddening of the heavens  and the white mist curling up like smoke.    I sat down beside Diccon on the log. I did not speak to him, nor he to  me; there seemed no need of speech. In the [v]pandemonium to which the  world had narrowed, the one familiar, matter-of-course thing was that he  and I were to die together.    The stakes were in the ground and painted red, the wood was properly  fixed. The Indian woman who held the torch that was to light the pile  ran past us, whirling the wood around her head to make it blaze more  fiercely. As she went by she lowered the brand and slowly dragged it  across my wrists. The beating of the drums suddenly ceased, and the loud  voices died away.    Seeing that they were coming for us, Diccon and I rose to await them.  When they were nearly upon us, I turned to him and held out my hand.    He made no motion to take it. Instead, he stood with fixed eyes looking  past me and slightly upward. A sudden pallor had overspread the bronze  of his face.    \"There's a verse somewhere,\" he said in a quiet voice,--\"it's in the  Bible, I think--I heard it once long ago: 'I will look unto the hills  from whence cometh my help.' Look, sir!\"    I turned and followed with my eyes the pointing of his finger. In front  of us the bank rose steeply, bare to the summit,--no trees, only the red  earth, with here and there a low growth of leafless bushes. Behind it  was the eastern sky. Upon the crest, against the sunrise, stood the  figure of a man--an Indian. From one shoulder hung an otterskin, and a  great bow was in his hand. His limbs were bare, and as he stood  motionless, bathed in the rosy light, he looked like some bronze god,  perfect from the beaded moccasins to the calm, uneager face below the  feathered head-dress. He had but just risen above the brow of the hill;  the Indians in the hollow saw him not.    While Diccon and I stared, our tormentors were upon us. They came a  dozen or more at once, and we had no weapons. Two hung on my arms, while  a third laid hold of my doublet to rend it from me. An arrow whistled  over our heads and stuck into a tree behind us. The hands that clutched  me dropped, and with a yell the busy throng turned their faces in the  direction whence had come the arrow.    The Indian who had sent that dart before him was descending the bank. An  instant's breathless hush while they stared at the solitary figure; then  the dark forms bent forward for the rush straightened, and there arose a  cry of recognition. \"The son of Powhatan! The son of Powhatan!\"    He came down the hillside to the level of the hollow, the authority of  his look and gesture making way for him through the crowd that surged  this way and that, and walked up to us where we stood, hemmed round but  no longer in the clutch of our enemies.    \"You were never more welcome, Nantaquas,\" I said to him, heartily.    Taking my hand in his, the chief turned to his frowning countrymen. \"Men  of the [v]Pamunkeys!\" he cried, \"this is Nantaquas' friend, and so the  friend of all the tribes that called Powhatan 'father.' The fire is not  for him nor for his servant; keep it for the [v]Monacans and for the  dogs of the [v]Long House! The calumet is for the friend of Nantaquas,  and the dance of the maidens, the noblest buck and the best of the  fish-weirs.\"    There was a surging forward of the Indians and a fierce murmur of  dissent. The werowance, standing out from the throng, lifted his voice.  \"There was a time,\" he cried, \"when Nantaquas was the panther crouched  upon the bough above the leader of the herd; now Nantaquas is a tame  panther and rolls at the white men's feet! There was a time when the  word of the son of Powhatan weighed more than the lives of many dogs  such as these, but I know not why we should put out the fire at his  command! He is war chief no longer, for [v]Opechancanough will have no  tame panther to lead the tribes. Opechancanough is our head, and he  kindleth a fire indeed. We will give to this man what fuel we choose,  and to-night Nantaquas may look for his bones!\"    He ended, and a great clamor arose. The Paspaheghs would have cast  themselves upon us again but for a sudden action of the young chief, who  had stood motionless, with raised hand and unmoved face, during the  werowance's bitter speech. Now he flung up his hand, and in it was a  bracelet of gold, carved and twisted like a coiled snake and set with a  green stone. I had never seen the toy before, but evidently others had.  The excited voices fell, and the Indians, Pamunkeys and Paspaheghs  alike, stood as though turned to stone.    Nantaquas smiled coldly. \"This day hath Opechancanough made me war chief  again. We have smoked the peace pipe together--my father's brother and  I--in the starlight, sitting before his lodge, with the wide marshes and  the river dark at our feet. Singing birds in the forest have been many;  evil tales have they told; Opechancanough has stopped his ears against  their false singing. My friends are his friends, my brother is his  brother, my word is his word: witness the armlet that hath no like.  Opechancanough is at hand; he comes through the forest with his two  hundred warriors. Will you, when you lie at his feet, have him ask you,  'Where is the friend of my friend, of my war chief?'\"    There came a long, deep breath from the Indians, then a silence in which  they fell back, slowly and sullenly--whipped hounds but with the will to  break that leash of fear.    \"Hark!\" said Nantaquas, smiling. \"I hear Opechancanough and his warriors  coming over the leaves.\"    The noise of many footsteps was indeed audible, coming toward the hollow  from the woods beyond. With a burst of cries, the priests and the  conjurer whirled away to bear the welcome of Okee to the royal  worshipper, and at their heels went the chief men of the Pamunkeys. The  werowance of the Paspaheghs was one that sailed with the wind; he  listened to the deepening sound and glanced at the son of Powhatan where  he stood, calm and confident, then smoothed his own countenance and made  a most pacific speech, in which all the blame of the late proceedings  was laid upon the singing birds. When he had done speaking, the young  men tore the stakes from the earth and threw them into a thicket, while  the women plucked apart the newly kindled fire and flung the brands into  a little nearby stream, where they went out in a cloud of hissing steam.    I turned to the Indian who had wrought this miracle. \"Art sure it is not  a dream, Nantaquas? I think that Opechancanough would not lift a finger  to save me from all the deaths the tribes could invent.\"    \"Opechancanough is very wise,\" he answered quietly. \"He says that now  the English will believe in his love indeed when they see that he holds  dear even one who might be called his enemy, who hath spoken against him  at the Englishmen's council fire. He says that for five suns Captain  Percy shall feast with him, and then shall go back free to Jamestown. He  thinks that then Captain Percy will not speak against him any more,  calling his love to the white men only words with no good deeds  behind.\"    He spoke simply, out of the nobility of his nature, believing his own  speech. I that was older, and had more knowledge of men and the masks  they wear, was but half deceived. My belief in the hatred of the dark  emperor was not shaken, and I looked yet to find the drop of poison  within this honey flower. How poisoned was that bloom, God knows I could  not guess!    By this time we three were alone in the hollow, for all the savages, men  and women, had gone forth to meet the Indian whose word was law from the  falls of the far west to the Chesapeake. The sun now rode above the low  hills, pouring its gold into the hollow and brightening all the world  besides. A chant raised by the Indians grew nearer, and the rustling of  the leaves beneath many feet more loud and deep; then all noise ceased  and Opechancanough entered the hollow alone. An eagle feather was thrust  through his scalp lock; over his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19723"],[0,"The Cliff Ruins of Canyon de Chelly, Arizona (#11)"],[1,"portion continued to be inhabited for some time after the  lower portion. The contrivance for closing openings is identical with  examples found in the Mesa Verde region, and it is probable that an  intimate connection between the two existed.      III--HOME VILLAGES LOCATED FOR DEFENSE    The distinction between home villages located on bottom lands absolutely  without reference to the defensive value of the site, and other villages  located on defensive sites, is to some extent an arbitrary one. The  former, which are always located at the base of or under an overhanging  cliff, sometimes occupy slightly raised ground which overlooks the  adjacent land, and the latter are sometimes so slightly raised above the  bottoms they overlook as hardly to come within the classification.  Moreover, ruins in their present condition sometimes belong to both  classes, as in the example last described. Yet a general distinction may  be drawn between the classes, in that the former are generally located  directly upon the bottom land and invariably without thought or regard  to the defensive value of the site, while in the latter the effect of  this requirement is always apparent.    The class of ruins which has been designated as the remains of villages  located for defense comprises all the most striking remains in the  canyon, many of which may properly be termed cliff ruins. The  characteristics of the class are: A site more or less difficult of  access--generally an elaborate ground plan, although sometimes they  consist of only a few rooms--and the invariable presence of the kiva or  estufa, here always circular in form. The largest ruin of this class  occurs in Del Muerto, and is known as Mummy Cave ruin. It is called by  the Navajo Tse-i-ya-kin. It is situated in the upper part of the canyon,  near the junction of a small branch, and has an extensive outlook.    At a height of about 80 feet above the top of a gentle slope of earth  and loose rock, and perhaps 300 feet above the stream bed, there are two  coves in the rock, connected by a narrow bench. The western cove is  about 100 feet across and its back is perhaps 75 feet from the front  wall of the cliff. The eastern cove is over 200 feet across and perhaps  100 feet deep, while the connecting ledge is about 110 feet long. Ruins  occur on the central ledge and on similar ledges in the back parts of  both coves.    The western or smaller cove is accessible only from the ledge, which in  turn can be approached only from the eastern cove. The smaller cove had  a row of little rooms across the back and there are traces of walls on  the slope in front of these. Fourteen rooms can now be made out on the  ground; altogether there may have been 20 rooms in this portion.  Practically all the available space on the ledge was occupied by rooms,  and 10, all of considerable size, can now be traced. The total number in  this portion was 14 or 15. The eastern cove contained the largest part  of the settlement. The back part is occupied by a ledge about 50 feet  wide entirely covered by remains of walls. Some 44 rooms can now be made  out on the ground, in addition to 3 or perhaps 4 circular kivas, and the  whole number of rooms may have been 55. Assuming, then, that the various  portions of the ruin were inhabited at the same time, we would have a  total of 90 rooms; but, as many of them could be used only for storage,  the population could not have been more than 60 persons.    The rooms in the western cove are fairly uniform in size and were  probably habitations, for they are all too large to be classed as  storage rooms. There was no kiva in this portion, however, nor any  unoccupied place where a kiva might have been placed. It seems clear,  therefore, that this portion was either an appendage of the other or was  occupied at a later period; in either case it was constructed at a date  subsequent to the remains in the eastern cove.      [Illustration: Plate XLVIII    Mummy Cave, Central and Eastern Part]    The intermediate ledge, which is about 110 feet long and about 30 feet  wide, was practically all occupied by a row of seven rooms, some of them  of more than one story. These rooms are exceptionally large--larger than  any group of rooms in the canyon or in this part of the country. The  outside or front wall is more than 20 feet from the cliff back of it,  and the rooms are from 10 to 15 feet wide. Figure 16, which is a ground  plan of the ruin, shows the exceptional size of these rooms. All of them  were at least two stories high; some were three. The walls in this  portion are generally 2 feet or more thick and exceptionally well  constructed. Its eastern end is still standing to a height of three  stories, and carries a roof intact, giving a tower-like effect to that  portion. Originally this portion rose but one story above the other  rooms. Throughout nearly all its length the front wall shows part of the  upper story, which is also marked on the cliff wall by a thin wash of  clay, in the same manner as in the Casa Blanca ruin. The two rooms west  of the tower were surmounted by a single large room. The cliff wall is  coated with a thin wash of yellowish clay, and no mark of a cross wall  or partition can be seen upon it. There are no openings between the  three eastern rooms on the ground floor. The first room to the west of  the tower has a square chimney-like shaft, and a niche or alcove  connected with it. The second room also has a niche and a rounded shaft.  The third room has neither niche nor shaft.      [Illustration: Fig. 16--Ground plan of Mummy Cave ruin.]    The front wall was exceptionally heavy, but the upper portion has fallen  inward, forming a heavy mass of debris against it. The east and south  sides of the tower, for about 5 feet of its height, are decorated by  inlaying small stones 1 to 2 inches long and half an inch thick. The  same decoration occurs at intervals down the front wall, but  irregularly. This feature is not chinking, such as has been described,  and has no constructive value, but is purely decorative. Back of the  rooms west of the tower there are some old pictographs on the cliff wall  at the place where the roof abutted on it. Here the wash of clay before  mentioned was necessarily omitted. In the first room there is a  pictograph of a man, in the second a semicircle, both done in  light-green paint.    The lower part of the outer corner of the tower has fallen out. At this  point there was a small doorway or opening, which was the only entrance  on the south or east. The corner which has fallen was apparently  supported by three or four sticks laid horizontally on the rock at an  angle of 45 degrees with either wall. The giving way of the timber  support apparently caused the fall of the corner, but why a structure  otherwise so substantial should be placed on such frail support, when a  filling of masonry was both easy and practicable, is not clear.    The doorway mentioned is the only opening into the ground-floor room in  the tower. Connection with the rooms on the west was through a large  doorway in the western wall of the second story, and in the story above  there was a similar opening. These are shown in plate XLVIII, which is a  general view of the central portion of the eastern cove.    The lintels of the openings in the central part are formed of round  sticks, about 3 inches in diameter, matched, and bound together with  withes. These withes may be seen in places where the mud plaster has  fallen away. The stick lintels occur only in the central portion; the  windows and doorways of the other portions of the ruin, some fine  examples of which remain, are always finished with stone lintels and  sometimes with stone jambs.    A little east of the center of the front wall there is a large rock, or  rather a pile of large rocks, near the outer edge of the ledge. This is  shown in the illustration. Instead of removing this obstruction the wall  was built under and over it. Near the western end of the front wall  there is a large doorway or opening. Access to the western cove was  along the narrow edge of the ledge under the front wall, thence through  this doorway. The doorway gave entrance to a very narrow space, less  than 4 feet square, surrounded by a heavy wall with a doorway through  the left or western wall into the last apartment of the series. Through  the western wall of this apartment a doorway opened on the end of the  ledge and the western cove. This principal entrance is shown in plate  XLVIII. Its size is exceptional, it being about 6 feet high. A little  below the top there is a single stick across it, and a similar  contrivance was found in place in the openings in the tower, but it does  not occur in the opening in the cross wall. The same feature is found in  the modern pueblos, where the stick forms the support of a blanket  draped to close the opening.      [Illustration: Plate XLIX    Eastern Cove of Mummy Cave]    A little east of the doorway in the front wall there is a small opening  near the ground, through which can be seen what appears to be a roof. It  is but 2 feet above the ground, however, and very roughly constructed.  It consists of a layer of cedar logs; above this a layer of small  sticks, and above this again slabs of stone and mud. It occurs under a  narrow room or passage, shown on the plan, and seems to have been the  floor of that room rather than a roof of a space below.    Roofing or flooring beams project from the tower on three sides. They  are all rounded and carefully selected or matched. Those of the lower  story or first roof are 41/2 inches in diameter, those of the story above  about 3 inches, while those of the roof, which occur in pairs, are about  21/2 inches. They all, except those of the lower story, project about  2 feet from the wall. All the beams are from 18 inches to 2 feet apart,  and the roof is formed of canes or willow sticks less than half an "]]]
