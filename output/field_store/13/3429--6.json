Learned and common folk, the  sober and the frivolous alike, swore by Franklin. Snuff-boxes,  furniture, dishes, even stoves, were gotten up a la Franklin. The old  man's portrait was in every house. That the French Government, in spite  of a monarch who was half afraid of the rising nation beyond sea, had  given America her hearty support, was in no small measure due to the  influence of Franklin. And his skill in diplomacy was of the greatest  value in the negotiations now pending.    These were necessarily long and tedious, but Jay, Franklin's colleague,  made them needlessly so by his finical refusal to treat till England had  acknowledged our independence by a separate act. This, indeed,  jeopardized peace itself, since Shelburne's days of ministerial power  were closing, and his successor was sure to be less our friend. Jay at  last receded, a compromise being arrived at by which the treaty was to  open with a virtual recognition of independence in acknowledging Adams,  Franklin, and Jay as \"plenipotentiaries,\" that is, agents of a sovereign  power. Boundaries, fishery rights, and the treatment of loyalists and  their property were the chief bones of contention.    As the negotiations wore on it became apparent that Spain and France,  now that their vengeance was sated against England by our independence,  were more unfriendly to our territorial enlargement than England itself.  There still exists a map on which Spain's minister had indicated what he  wished to make our western bound. The line follows nearly the meridian  of Pittsburgh. This attitude of those powers excused our  plenipotentiaries, though bound by our treaty with France not to  conclude peace apart from her, for making the preliminary arrangements  with England privately. At last, on November 30, 1782, Franklin, Jay,  and John Adams set their signatures to preliminary articles, which were  incorporated in a treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United  States, France, and Spain, signed at Paris on September 3, 1783. David  Hartley signed for England. Our Congress ratified on February 14, 1784.    The treaty recognized the independence of the United States. It  established as boundaries nearly the present Canadian line on the north,  the Mississippi on the west, and Florida, which now returned to Spain  and extended to the Mississippi, on the south. Despite the wishes of  Spain, the free navigation of the Mississippi, from source to mouth, was  guaranteed to the United States and Great Britain. Fishery rights  received special attention. American fishermen were granted the  privilege of fishing, as before the war, on the banks of Newfoundland,  in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and in all other places in the sea where  the inhabitants of both countries had been accustomed to fish. Liberty  was also granted to take fish on such parts of the coast of Newfoundland  as British fishermen should use, and on the coasts, bays, and creeks of  all other British dominions in America. American fishermen could dry and  cure fish on the unsettled parts of Nova Scotia, Labrador, and the  Magdalen Islands. America agreed, for the protection of British  creditors, that debts contracted before the war should be held valid,  and should be payable in sterling money. It was also stipulated that  Congress should earnestly recommend to the several States the  restitution of all confiscated property belonging to loyalists.      [Illustration: Image of treaty signatures.]  \"Done at Paris, this third Day of September,  In the Year of our Lord one thousand and seven hundred & eighty three.--  D. Hartley, John Adams, B. Franklin, John Jay\"  Facsimile of Signatures to Treaty of Peace      [1783]    Peace came like a heavenly benediction to the country and the army,  exhausted by so long and so fierce a struggle. No general engagement  took place after the siege of Yorktown; but the armies kept close watch  upon each other, and minor skirmishes were frequent. Washington's 10,000  men were encamped near the Hudson, to see that Clinton's forces in New  York did no harm. In the South, Greene's valiant band, aided by Wayne  and his rangers, without regular food or pay, kept the British cooped up  in Charleston and Augusta.    Congress in due time declared cessation of hostilities, and on April 19,  1783, just eight years from the battle of Lexington, Washington read the  declaration at the headquarters of his army. The British had evacuated  Charleston the previous December. In July, Savannah saw the last of the  redcoats file out, and the British troops were collected at New York. On  November 25th, Sir Guy Carleton, who had superseded Clinton, embarked  with his entire army, besides a throng of refugees, in boats for Long  Island and Staten Island, where they soon took ship for England. \"The  imperial standard of Great Britain fell at the fort over which it had  floated for a hundred and twenty years, and in its place the Stars and  Stripes of American Independence flashed in the sun. Fleet and army,  royal flag and scarlet uniform, coronet and ribbon, every sign and  symbol of foreign authority, which from Concord to Saratoga and from  Saratoga to Yorktown had sought to subdue the colonies, vanished from  these shores. Colonial and provincial America had ended, national  America had begun.\"    The American troops took possession of New York amid the huzzas of the  people and the roar of cannon. On November 25th, Washington with his  suite, surrounded by grateful and admiring throngs, made a formal entry  into the city whence he had been compelled to flee seven years before.    The time had now come when the national hero might lay down the great  burden which he had borne with herculean strength and courage through so  many years of distress and gloom. On December 4th he joined his  principal officers at the popular Fraunces's Tavern, near the Battery,  to bid them farewell. Tears filled every eye. Even Washington could not  master his feelings, as one after another the heroes who had been with  him upon the tented field and in so many moments of dreadful strife drew  near to press his hand. They followed him through ranks of parading  infantry to the Whitehall ferry, where he boarded his barge, and waving  his hat in a last, voiceless farewell, crossed to the Jersey shore.    Arrived at Annapolis after a journey which had been one long ovation,  the saviour of his country appeared before Congress, December 23d, to  resign the commission which he had so grandly fulfilled. His address was  in noble key, but abbreviated by choking emotion. The President of  Congress having replied in fitting words, Washington withdrew, and  continued his journey to the long-missed peace and seclusion of his  Mount Vernon home.        CHAPTER VIII.    AMERICAN MANHOOD IN THE REVOLUTION    [1775-1781]    It would be foolish to say that the Revolutionary soldiers never  quailed. Militia too often gave way before the steady bayonet charge of  British regulars, at times fleeing panic-stricken. Troops whose term of  service was out would go home at critical moments. Hardships and lack of  pay in a few instances led to mutiny and desertion. But the marvel is  that they fought so bravely, endured so much, and complained so little.  One reason was the patriotism of the people at large behind them.  Soldiers who turned their backs on Boston, leaving Washington in the  lurch, were refused food along the road home. Women placed rifles in the  hands of husbands, sons, or lovers, and said \"Go!\"    The rank and file in this war, coming from farm, work-bench,  logging-camp, or fisher's boat, had a superb physical basis for camp and  field life. Used to the rifle from boyhood, they kept their powder dry  and made every one of their scanty bullets tell. The Revolutionary  soldier's splendid courage has glorified a score of battle-fields; while  Valley Forge, with its days of hunger and nights of cold, its sick-beds  on the damp ground, and its bloody footprints in the snow, tell of his  patient endurance.    At Bunker Hill an undisciplined body of farmers, ill-armed, weary,  hungry and thirsty, calmly awaited the charge of old British  campaigners, and by a fire of dreadful precision drove them back. \"They  may talk of their Mindens and their Fontenoys,\" said the British  general, Howe, \"but there was no such fire there.\" At Charleston, while  the wooden fort shook with the British broadsides, Moultrie and his  South Carolina boys, half naked in the stifling heat, through twelve  long hours smoked their pipes and carefully pointed their guns. At Long  Island, to gain time for the retreat of the rest, five Maryland  companies flew again and again in the face of the pursuing host. At  Monmouth, eight thousand British were in hot pursuit of the retreating  Americans. Square in their front Washington planted two Pennsylvania and  Maryland regiments, saying, \"Gentlemen, I depend upon you to hold the  ground until I can form the main army.\" And hold it they did.    Heroism grander than that of the battlefield, which can calmly meet an  ignominious death, was not lacking. Captain Nathan Hale, a quiet,  studious spirit, just graduated from Yale College, volunteered to enter  the British lines on Long Island as a spy. He was caught, and soon swung  from an apple tree in Colonel Rutgers's orchard, a corpse. Bible and  religious ministrations denied him, his letters to mother and sister  destroyed, women standing by and sobbing, he met his fate without a  tremor. \"I only regret,\" comes his voice from yon rude scaffold, \"that I  have but one life to give for my country.\" It is a shame that America so  long had no monument to this heroic man. One almost rejoices that the  British captain,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22581"],[0,"The Child-Voice in Singing (#11)"],[1,"rm, and not  adapted to the finest tone-effects. In singing this element, the jaw  should drop much lower than for _[)i]_ and nearly as low as for _ah_.      _[:A] or AH._    This is the tone universally accepted as the best for voice-development;  but in school-singing it is not permissible to use the voice except in  the lightest manner, therefore purity of tone must content our  ambitions; power can come later in life. The mouth opens widely for this  tone and the whole throat is expanded.      _[A:] or AW._    This element is formed very much like _ah_. It is _ah_ broadened a  little. The jaw drops to a lower point and the mouth-cavity deepens,  while at the same time the extension from side to side narrows a little.      _[-O] and OO._    These sounds are better adapted to securing the use of the thin voice,  where pupils have been accustomed to the use of the thick voice, than  any other vowel-element. The mouth is well opened back of the lips,  which should not be puckered as if to whistle, but relaxed instead.    In actual practice there may be observed a tendency, more or less  marked, but pretty sure to manifest itself if practice on one sound is  continued too long at a time, to deviate from any one toward some other  vowel-element, as _[)i]_ to _[-e]_, _eh_ to _[)i]_, _ah_ to _er_ or _er_  or _uh_, _aw_ to _uh_, _[-o]_ to _oo_.    If this tendency to deviate from the right tone be permitted, the most  slovenly habits will be formed, and all distinctions in vowel-sound  disappear. Vowel-practice had better be omitted from class-work unless  carefully and conscientiously taught.    If the course of music embraces drill upon scales, vowel-practice may be  incorporated into the course easily. For instance, the drill outlined  upon p. 70 may one day be given with _e_ for a few moments, then with  _o_. On another day the drill may be upon _ah_, followed by _eh_, and  so on. It is unnecessary to particularize. Every teacher will at once  see how to apply practically vowel-singing to his music course. The  exercises and songs may be sung with vowel-sounds. Nearly all books  advise the use of _la_, _lo_, etc., in vocal exercises; but while that  method of singing is unobjectionable, the vocalization of solfeggii, it  may be observed, is established by the sanction of time and the  experience of thousands of voice-trainers the world over.    The advantages which flow from vocalizing exercises and songs on a  single vowel-sound are too many to be described in a word. No supervisor  or teacher of music can afford to use _do_, _re_, _mi_, exclusively.    Another class of exercises is now suggested which may be sung upon one  breath. They will be found especially adapted to develop flexibility and  a ready adjustment of the movable parts of the vocal tube to the  positions suited to the formation of the different vowel-sounds. If  three sounds are used as here given, they must be sung quite slowly, the  change from one sound to the next being made by a quick, easy change of  position of the jaw, tongue, etc., but without interrupting the  continuity of the tone.    Sufficient pause to obtain a new breath must be made at the end of each  group, and the mouth opened properly for the production of the first  sound of the next group before it is attacked. The time should be        [Music: f' f' f' {sung on o, e, o}]    quite slow and as in illustration, or the breath will not be used, and  at each succeeding group of tones the lungs will become too full of air.  The attack will then be explosive, and the tone too loud, if, indeed,  the effort to control the breath does not contract and pinch the throat.    Eight groups are given for ascending a scale and eight for descending:      [-o]  [-e]   [-o]   [-o]   [-e]    [)i]    [-o]  [)i]   [-o]   [-o]   [-e]    oo    [-o]  ah  [-o]  _o_  ah  _e_    [-o]  eh  [-o]   [-o]   ah   eh    [-o]  aw  [-o]   [-o]   ah   aw    [-o]  [-e]   eh  [-o]   ah   [)i]    [-o]  [-e]   ah  [-o]   ah   oo    [-o]  [-e]   aw  [-o]   eh   [-e]    It will be observed that a certain system of arrangement of the  vowel-elements is followed. First, there are five groups, of which _o_  is the first and last sound, the others being placed between. Then _o_  is the first tone with _e_ as the second, the other sounds in turn  ending the group. Next _ah_ is the second sound, then _eh_, _i_, _oo_  and _ah_ might be used as the second vowel-element, making thirty-five  combinations with _o_ as the initial sound of each group. The same  number of combinations can be made with _ah_ as the first tone, and so  on with each of the seven vowel-elements.    Sixteen of these groups, changed from time to time as may be desired,  can be written upon the blackboard and sung by the class in the way set  forth, the teacher meanwhile keeping time for and directing the class.    It may be observed in this connection, that, as the voice ascends in  pitch, there is a tendency to blend the various vowel-sounds into one  sound. As the tones grow higher the sound-waves are focused at higher  points upon the hard-palate, the sounding-board of the resonance  cavities, and more difficulty is experienced in moulding these  sound-waves into the forms characteristic of the different  vowel-elements. As the parts concerned in tone-formation gain in  flexibility, the result appears in the ease with which the alterations  in shape of the resonance tube are made at higher pitches.    Fads and devices which divert attention from the subject and retard  rather than accelerate the progress of pupils are common enough in  schools, but the following simple illustrations of different vowel-forms  may be found useful:      [Illustration:    {mouth shapes}    [-e]  [)i]  eh    {mouth shapes}    ah  aw  o  oo]    The base line represents the floor or base of the mouth-cavity, and the  arch, the height and width of the mouth for each sound; the depth is not  indicated. The width of the mouth from side to side is represented as  greatest in _[-e]_, _[)i]_ and _eh_, while the height is greater in  _ah_ and _aw_, _o_ is pictured as nearly round, and _oo_ the same,  only small.    It is not contended that these diagrams picture the actual form assumed  by the resonance cavities very accurately. The various positions which  the tongue and the soft-palate assume are not shown at all, nor,  perhaps, is it necessary; for if the pupil is taught to drop the lower  jaw to the right position for each sound, and to keep the tongue prone  in the mouth, a mental picture of each tone will be formed, and the  thought will regulate the action. When the pupil can think the sound  desired, the conditions for its formation will be met by the vocal  organs. The usefulness of diagrams will then cease.      _Consonants and Articulation._    \"Consonants are the bones of speech. By means of consonants we  articulate our words; that is, we give them joints. We utter vowels, we  articulate consonants. If we utter a single vowel-sound and interrupt it  by a consonant, we get an articulation. Consonants, then, not only give  speech its articulation or joints, but they help words to stand and have  form, just as a skeleton keeps the animal from falling into a shapeless  mass of flesh; therefore, consonants are the bones of speech. The  consonant is the distinguishing element of human speech. Man has been  defined in various ways according to various attributes, functions and  habits. He might well be called the consonant-using animal. He alone of  all animals uses consonants. It is the consonant which makes the chief  difference between the cries of beasts and the speech of man.\"  --_Richard Grant White_.    Consonants are not to be sung. The effort so common among singers to  pronounce, by sustaining consonant sounds, is entirely misdirected.  _M_, _n_ and _ng_, which are made by shutting off the escape of the  air-current at either the lips or the hard-palate, and so forcing it  through the nose, are often sustained to the detriment of beauty of tone  and clear pronunciation as well.    Articulation, which is the pronunciation of a consonantal sound, is  accomplished by interrupting the air-current, whether vibratory or not,  at certain points. The interruptions are made by the meeting of the lips  with each other or with the teeth, by the tongue with the teeth or  hard-palate, and the root of the tongue with the soft-palate. The  interruption may be complete, as in _p_ or _t_, or only partial, as in  _th_. The sound of the consonant results from the slight explosion or  puff which follows the recoil of the movable parts from the point of  contact.    All consonants may for singing purposes be considered as preceding or  following some vowel-sound. If preceding, then after the sound is made  the vocal organs must be adjusted at once for the proper formation of  the succeeding vowel. If the consonant sound follows a vowel-tone, the  movement of the vocal organs to the interrupting point must be quick and  vocalization at once cease; for if the vowel-sound is prolonged after  the production of the consonant, the effect will be an added syllable to  the word as _at-at-er_, _up-up-pah_, etc. The movements of the organs of  speech for both contact and recoil must be more rapid in singing to  produce distinct articulation than in spoken language.    Slovenly habits of articulation in speech will reappear in song, and the  converse is also true. The study and practice of phonics, which is now  general in schools, is of the highest practical importance in singing,  as well as in reading or speaking. As consonant sounds cannot be sung,  they are best taught in spoken language. The application of the  knowledge and skill thus gained is readily applied to the pronunciation  of words in singing. If the vowel-elements have been carefully practiced  in vocalizes, there will be little effort required to secure the correct  formation of all the vowel-sounds of words.    The nasal"]]]
