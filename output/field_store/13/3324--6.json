The original site of this tree has not been definitely  agreed upon. Professor L. H. Bailey reports that it is indigenous in  Michigan, and northern collectors find both sexes in New Hampshire and  Vermont; while in central and southern New England the staminate tree is  rarely if ever seen, and the pistillate flowers seldom if ever mature  perfect fruit. The evidence seems to indicate a narrow belt extending  through northern New Hampshire, Vermont and Michigan, with the  intermediate southern sections of the Province of Ontario as the home of  the Balm of Gilead.         Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,--occasional; Ontario,--frequent.    New England,--occasional throughout.         South to New Jersey; west to Michigan and Minnesota.    =Habit.=--A medium-sized tree, 40-60 feet high; trunk 1-3 feet in  diameter, straight or inclined, sometimes beset with a few crooked,  bushy branchlets; head very variable in shape and size; solitary in open  ground, commonly _broad-based, spacious, and pyramidal_, among other  trees more often rather small; loosely and irregularly branched, with  sparse, coarse, and often crooked spray; _foliage dark green, handsome,  and abundant_; all parts characterized by a strong and peculiar resinous  fragrance. A single tree multiplying by suckers often becomes parent of  a grove covering half an acre, more or less, made up of trees of all  ages and sizes.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk and lower portions of large branches dark gray,  rough, irregularly striate and firm in old trees; in young trees and  upon smaller branches smooth, soft grayish-green, often flanged by  prominent ridges running down the stalk from the vertices of the  triangular leaf-scars; season's shoots often flanged, shining reddish or  olive green, with occasional longitudinal gray lines, viscid.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds dark reddish-brown, rather closely set  along the stalk, conical or somewhat angled, narrow, often falcate,  sharp-pointed, resinous throughout, viscid, aromatic, exhaling a  powerful odor when the scales expand, terminal about 3/4 inch long.  Leaves 4-6 inches long and nearly as wide, yellowish-green at first,  becoming dark green and smooth on the upper surface with the exception  of a _minute pubescence along the veins_, dull light green beneath,  finely serrate with incurved glandular points, usually ciliate with  minute stiff, whitish hairs; base heart-shaped; apex short-pointed;  petioles about 1-1-1/2 inches long, _more or less hairy_, somewhat  flattened at right angles to the blade; stipules short, ovate, acute,  soon falling.    =Inflorescence.=--Similar to that of _P. balsamifera_.    =Fruit.=--Similar to that of _P. balsamifera_.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; has an attractive  foliage and grows rapidly in all soils and situations, but the branches  are easily broken by the wind, and its habit of suckering makes it  objectionable in ornamental ground; occasionally offered by nurserymen  and collectors. Propagated from cuttings.    [Illustration: PLATE XIX.--Populus candicans.]      1. Winter bud.    2. Branch with fertile catkins.    3. Fertile flower.    4.

SILVER-LEAF POPLAR.    =Range.=--Widely distributed in the Old World, extending in Europe from  southern Sweden to the Mediterranean, throughout northern Africa, and  eastward in Asia to the northwestern Himalayas. Introduced from England  by the early settlers and soon established in the colonial towns, as in  Plymouth and Duxbury, on the western shore of Massachusetts bay. Planted  or spontaneous over a wide area.         New Brunswick and Nova Scotia,--occasional.    New England,--occasional throughout, local, sometimes common.         Southward to Virginia.    =Habit.=--A handsome tree, resembling _P. grandidentata_ more than any  other American poplar, but of far nobler proportions; 40-75 feet high  and 2-4 feet in diameter at the ground; growing much larger in England;  head large, spreading; round-topped, in spring enveloped in a dazzling  cloud of cotton white, which resolves itself later into two  conspicuously contrasting surfaces of dark green and silvery white.    =Bark.=--Light gray, smooth upon young trees, in old trees furrowed upon  the trunk.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds not viscid, cottony. Leaves 1-4 inches  long, densely white-tomentose while expanding, when mature dark green  above and white-tomentose to glabrous beneath; outline ovate or deltoid,  3-5-lobed and toothed or simply toothed, teeth irregular; base  heart-shaped or truncate; apex acute to obtuse; leafstalk long, slender,  compressed; stipules soon falling.    =Inflorescence and Fruit.=--April to May. Sterile catkins 2-4 inches  long, cylindrical, fertile at first shorter,--stamens 6-16; anthers  purple: capsules 1/4 inch long, narrow-ovoid; seeds hairy.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy. Thrives even in very poor soils and in  exposed situations; grows rapidly in good soils; of distinctive value in  landscape gardening but not adapted for planting along streets and upon  lawns of limited area on account of its habit of throwing out numerous  suckers and its liability to damage from heavy winds. The sides of  country roads where the abele has been planted are sometimes obstructed  for a considerable distance by the thrifty shoots from underground.      =Salix discolor. Muhl.=    PUSSY WILLOW. GLAUCOUS WILLOW.    =Habitat and Range.=--Low, wet grounds; banks of streams, swamps, moist  hillsides.         Nova Scotia to Manitoba.    Maine,--abundant; common throughout the other New England states.         South to North Carolina; west to Illinois and Missouri.    =Habit.=--Mostly a tall shrub with several stems, but occasionally  assuming a tree-like habit, with a height of 15-20 feet and trunk  diameter of 5-10 inches; one tree reported at Laconia, N. H., 35 feet  high (F. W. Batchelder); branches few, stout, ascending, forming a very  open, hemispherical head.    =Bark.=--Trunk reddish-brown; branches dark-colored; branchlets light  green, orange-dotted.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds ovate-conical; apex obtuse to acute.  Leaves simple, alternate, 2-4 inches long, smooth and bright green  above, smooth and whitish beneath when fully grown; outline  ovate-lanceolate to narrowly oblong-oval, crenulate-serrate to entire;  apex acute, base acute and entire; leafstalk short; stipules toothed or  entire.    =Inflorescence.=--March to April. Appearing before the leaves in  catkins, sterile and fertile on separate plants, occasionally both kinds  on the same plant, sessile,--sterile spreading or erect,  oblong-cylindrical, silky; calyx none; petals none; bracts entire,  reddish-brown turning to black, oblong to oblong-obovate, with long,  silky hairs; stamens 2; filaments distinct: fertile catkins spreading;  bracts oblong to ovate, hairy; style short; stigma deeply 4-lobed.    =Fruit.=--Fruiting catkins somewhat declined: capsules ovate-conical,  tomentose, stem two-thirds the length of the scale: seeds numerous.    =Horticultural Value.=--Picturesque in blossom and fruit; its value  dependent chiefly upon its matted roots for holding wet banks, and its  ability to withstand considerable shade. Sold by plant collectors;  easily propagated from cuttings.    [Illustration: PLATE XX.--Salix discolor.]      1. Leaf-buds.    2. Branch with sterile catkins.    3. Sterile flower.    4.

New England,--occasional throughout, frequent along the larger streams.         South to Florida; west to Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Indian       territory, Louisiana, Texas, southern California, and south into       Mexico.    =Habit.=--A large shrub or small tree, 25-40 feet high and 10-15 inches  in trunk diameter, attaining great size in the Ohio and Mississippi  valleys and the valley of the lower Colorado; trunk short, surmounted by  an irregular, open, often roundish head, with stout, spreading branches,  slender branchlets, and twigs brittle towards their base.    _S. nigra_, var. _falcata_, Pursh., covers about the same range as the  type and differs chiefly in its narrower, falcate leaves.    =Bark.=--Trunk rough, in young trees light brown, in old trees  dark-colored or nearly black, deeply and irregularly ridged, separated  on the surface into thick, plate-like scales; branchlets reddish-brown;  twigs bronze olive.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds narrowly conical, acute. Leaves simple,  alternate, appearing much later than those of _S. discolor_, 2-5 inches  long, somewhat pubescent on both sides when young, when mature green and  smooth above, paler and sometimes pubescent along the veins beneath;  outline narrowly lanceolate, finely serrate; apex acute or acuminate,  often curved; base acutish to rounded or slightly heart-shaped; petiole  short, usually pubescent; stipules large and persistent, or small and  soon falling.    =Inflorescence.=--April to May. Appearing with the leaves from the axils  of the short, lateral shoots, in catkins, sterile and fertile on  different trees, stalked,--sterile spreading, narrowly cylindrical;  calyx none; corolla none; bracts entire, rounded to oblong, villous,  ciliate; stamens"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20470"],[0,"Etiquette (#11)"],[1,"certainly was, for obvious reasons.  The cutlery was pretty, but practically unequal to even spring chicken.    The fork is held with the tines curving downward, that position giving  greater security to the morsel, and is raised laterally, the points  being turned, as it reaches the mouth, just enough to deposit the  morsel between the slightly-parted lips.  During this easy movement the  elbow scarcely moves from its position at the side, a fact gratefully  appreciated by one's next neighbor.  What is more awkward than the arm  projected, holding the fork pointing backward at a right angle to the  lips, the mouth opening wide like an automatic railway gate to an  approaching locomotive--the labored and ostentatious way in which food  is sometimes transported to its destination?  Nor, once in the mouth,  is it lost to sight forever.  Other people, seated opposite, are  compelled to witness it in successive stages of the grinding process,  as exhibited by the constant opening and shutting of the mouth during  mastication, or laughing and talking with the mouth full--faults of  heedless people of energetic but not refined manners.    Liquids are sipped from the side of the spoon, without noise or  suction.  In serving vegetables the tablespoon is inserted laterally,  not \"point first.\"    Celery is held in the fingers, asparagus also, unless the stalks are  too tender.  Green corn may be eaten from the cob, a good set of  natural teeth being the prime requisite.  It may be a perfectly  graceful performance if daintily managed.    The management of fruits in the dessert is another test of dainty  skill.  Oranges may be eaten in different ways.  Very juicy fruit may  be cut in halves across the sections and scooped out with a spoon.  The  drier \"seedless\" oranges are better peeled and separated.  With a fruit  knife, remove the tough skin of each peg, leaving enough dry fiber to  hold it by, in conveying it to the mouth.  Practice enables one easily  to \"make way with\" an orange.  Bananas are cut in two, the skin  removed; the fruit is held in the fingers, or--preferably--eaten with a  fork.  Juicy pears and peaches may be managed in the same way, at  discretion, the rule being that the fingers should touch as little as  possible fruits that are decidedly mushy.    The finger-bowl stands ready to repair all damages of the nature  suggested.  The fingers are dipped in the water and gently rinsed, and  then passed lightly over the lips, and both mouth and fingers are wiped  upon the napkin.    At a signal from the hostess, the ladies rise and return to the  drawing-room.  The gentlemen follow immediately, or remain a short time  for another glass of wine, when such is the provision of the host.      DINNER-TABLE TALK    The conversation at the dinner-table should be general, unless the  company is large, and the table too long to admit of it.  But in any  case, each one is responsible first of all for keeping up a pleasant  chat with his or her partner, and not allowing that one to be neglected  while attention is riveted on some aggressively brilliant talker at the  other end of the table.  No matter how uninteresting one's partner may  be, one must be thoughtful and entertaining; and such kind attention  may win the life-long gratitude of a timid _debutante_, or the equally  unsophisticated country cousin.    Dinner-table talk should be affable.  The host and hostess must be  alert to turn the conversation from channels that threaten to lead to  antagonisms of opinion; and each guest should feel that it is more  important just now to make other people happy than to gratify his  impulse to \"floor\" them on the tariff question.  In short, at dinner,  as under most social conditions, the watchword ever in mind should be,  \"Not to myself alone.\"      INFORMAL DINNERS    The informal dinner, daily served in thousands of refined American  homes, is a much less pretentious affair than the name \"dinner\"  technically implies.  In most cases the service is but partially _a la  Russe_, most courses, and all the _entrees_, being set on the table,  the serving and \"helping\" being done by some member of the family; the  presence of a waitress being sometimes dispensed with except at  transition points; as, when the table is cleared before the dessert.  This formality is the most decided dinner feature of the meal, which  throughout its progress has been conducted more like a luncheon.  Yet,  in all essential points of mannerliness, the family dinner is governed  by the same rules that control the formal banquet.    It is perhaps needless to remark that the _diner a la Russe_ in its  perfection cannot be carried out without a number of competent  servants.  These may be hired when some special occasion warrants extra  preparations for due formality.  But for customary \"entertaining,\"  those who \"live quietly,\" with possibly but one domestic to assist with  the dinner, will show good sense in not attempting anything more  imposing than they are able to compass successfully.  The \"family  dinner\" has a dignity of its own when in keeping with all the  conditions; and though its _menu_ may be simple, its service  unpretentious, it may be the gracious exponent of a hospitality \"fit  for a king.\"    At the informal dinner it is customary to seat the guests in the order  in which they enter the dining-room, without assigning any place of  distinction; all the places at table being held of equal honor--comfort  and convenience being the things chiefly considered.          LUNCHEONS    The most elastic word in the whole vocabulary of entertaining is the  term _luncheon_.  It is applied to a mid-day meal occurring any time  between 11 A. M. and 3 P. M., and may mean anything, from a brilliant  _a la Russe_ banquet, to the hastily gathered together fragments left  from yesterday's dinner.    It may describe an hour of absolute leisure, and the most delightful  conversational interchange, or it may signify the five minutes' grab  from the side-board between the games of a closely-contested amateur  tennis tournament.    In general, we may say that the most formal of luncheons, resembling  the dinner in the main features of its serving, has these points of  distinction; the number of guests is irregular, usually uncertain, they  go to the table singly; they come dressed in any way that the hour of  the day, or their recent occupations warrant--men dropping in dressed  for business or sporting, and ladies in promenade costumes, with  bonnets or hats; the hour is not rigidly fixed,--luncheon, being  largely of cold dishes, is not spoiled by a half-hour's tardiness--a  late comer is greeted as cordially as the first arrival; and \"the more  the merrier\" seems to be the motto of the hostess who keeps \"open  house\" at luncheon time.    The formal luncheons for which engraved invitations are issued, are  usually \"ladies' luncheons;\" and the formality of the serving is  equalled by the elegance of the toilets.  Men have little leisure for  day-time entertainments, except during the brief outing at some summer  resort, where the easy-going lunch is the ruling fashion.    The _menu_ of the cold luncheon may present great variety, and provide  for many guests with little trouble.  For a smaller, or more definite,  number a hot luncheon may be prepared--a tender steak with mashed  potatoes and asparagus, or something equally simple--and a dessert of  cakes, ice-cream, and fruits; in all respects a little \"informal  dinner.\"    The large buffet luncheon, like the four o'clock tea, gives opportunity  for displaying all the pretty china that one owns.  Flowers and fruits  may decorate the table or tables, and the most artistic effects may be  secured by a little attention to blending and grouping.  A hostess _who  knows how_ can make her rooms look like a festal bower for these  occasions without much money outlay; and if she also is clever in the  compounding of made dishes and salads, she can give luncheons that are  remembered as the epitome of good style, albeit the bills for the same  were surprisingly small.  Such a gifted woman enjoys a sense of  exultation that is unknown to her richer sister, who merely fills out a  cheque for the cost and leaves all else to the caterer, as one must,  when the luncheon is given at a club or tea room.    In general, the buffet luncheon is much the same on all occasions, when  entertaining large companies at home.  The difference is not so much in  the way of serving, as in the kind of refreshments proffered.  The tea  may be a light affair, if you will; merely a bit and a sip for good  fellowship.  But the luncheon is one of the solid meals of the day,  requiring something substantial.  Such sustaining things as chicken  salad, appetizing sandwiches, bouillon (hot or jellied), cold sliced  ham, with relishes, as celery, olives, seasonable fruits, etc., satisfy  the normal hunger at noontime; and delicious cakes and ices with coffee  make a festal finale.  Almost any attractive luncheon dish may be  included, preferably things that are not hurt by standing; as the  luncheon service for a large party fills an hour or two.  For this  reason, coffee is the most manageable beverage to serve.    The refreshments are arranged on the dining-table.  A fine table-cloth  may be used; or handsome doylies if the table itself is of handsome  finish.  The salad bowl is set on one side, the platters of sandwiches,  etc., on the other; with the coffee urn at one end, the ices at the  other, if there is room; otherwise, the cake and ices are served from a  side table.  Another side table is desirable, to hold the stacks of  dishes and napkins.    As the hostess must give her entire attention to receiving her guests,  she intrusts the oversight of the dining-room to several matrons, who  are aided by a bevy of the younger girls (the young men also, at an  evening party).  At the proper time these young people pass the napkins"]]]
