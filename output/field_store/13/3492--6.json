In his youth he had been one of the most noted  sharpers and bullies of London. He had been introduced to Charles and  James when they were exiles in Flanders, as a man fit and ready for  the infamous service of assassinating the Protector. Soon after the  Restoration, Talbot attempted to obtain the favour of the royal family  by a service more infamous still. A plea was wanted which might justify  the Duke of York in breaking that promise of marriage by which he had  obtained from Anne Hyde the last proof of female affection. Such a plea  Talbot, in concert with some of his dissolute companions, undertook  to furnish. They agreed to describe the poor young lady as a creature  without virtue, shame, or delicacy, and made up long romances about  tender interviews and stolen favours. Talbot in particular related how,  in one of his secret visits to her, he had unluckily overturned the  Chancellor's inkstand upon a pile of papers, and how cleverly she had  averted a discovery by laying the blame of the accident on her monkey.  These stories, which, if they had been true, would never have passed the  lips of any but the basest of mankind, were pure inventions. Talbot was  soon forced to own that they were so; and he owned it without a blush.  The injured lady became Duchess of York. Had her husband been a man  really upright and honourable, he would have driven from his presence  with indignation and contempt the wretches who had slandered her. But  one of the peculiarities of James's character was that no act, however  wicked and shameful, which had been prompted by a desire to gain his  favour, ever seemed to him deserving of disapprobation. Talbot continued  to frequent the court, appeared daily with brazen front before the  princess whose ruin he had plotted, and was installed into the lucrative  post of chief pandar to her husband. In no long time Whitehall was  thrown into confusion by the news that Dick Talbot, as he was commonly  called, had laid a plan to murder the Duke of Ormond. The bravo was  sent to the Tower: but in a few days he was again swaggering about the  galleries, and carrying billets backward and forward between his patron  and the ugliest maids of honour. It was in vain that old and discreet  counsellors implored the royal brothers not to countenance this bad man,  who had nothing to recommend him except his fine person and his taste in  dress. Talbot was not only welcome at the palace when the bottle or  the dicebox was going round, but was heard with attention on matters of  business. He affected the character of an Irish patriot, and pleaded,  with great audacity, and sometimes with success, the cause of his  countrymen whose estates had been confiscated. He took care, however, to  be well paid for his services, and succeeded in acquiring, partly by  the sale of his influence, partly by gambling, and partly by pimping,  an estate of three thousand pounds a year. For under an outward show  of levity, profusion, improvidence, and eccentric impudence, he was in  truth one of the most mercenary and crafty of mankind. He was now no  longer young, and was expiating by severe sufferings the dissoluteness  of his youth: but age and disease had made no essential change in his  character and manners. He still, whenever he opened his mouth, ranted,  cursed and swore with such frantic violence that superficial observers  set him down for the wildest of libertines. The multitude was unable to  conceive that a man who, even when sober, was more furious and boastful  than others when they were drunk, and who seemed utterly incapable  of disguising any emotion or keeping any secret, could really be a  coldhearted, farsighted, scheming sycophant. Yet such a man was Talbot.  In truth his hypocrisy was of a far higher and rarer sort than the  hypocrisy which had flourished in Barebone's Parliament. For the  consummate hypocrite is not he who conceals vice behind the semblance  of virtue, but he who makes the vice which he has no objection to show a  stalking horse to cover darker and more profitable vice which it is for  his interest to hide.    Talbot, raised by James to the earldom of Tyrconnel, had commanded the  troops in Ireland during the nine months which elapsed between the death  of Charles and the commencement of the viceroyalty of Clarendon. When  the new Lord Lieutenant was about to leave London for Dublin, the  General was summoned from Dublin to London. Dick Talbot had long been  well known on the road which he had now to travel. Between Chester  and the capital there was not an inn where he had not been in a brawl.  Wherever he came he pressed horses in defiance of law, swore at  the cooks and postilions, and almost raised mobs by his insolent  rodomontades. The Reformation, he told the people, had ruined  everything. But fine times were coming. The Catholics would soon be  uppermost. The heretics should pay for all. Raving and blaspheming  incessantly, like a demoniac, he came to the court. [52] As soon as  he was there, he allied himself closely with Castelmaine, Dover, and  Albeville. These men called with one voice for war on the constitution  of the Church and the State. They told their master that he owed it to  his religion and to the dignity of his crown to stand firm against the  outcry of heretical demagogues, and to let the Parliament see from the  first that he would be master in spite of opposition, and that the only  effect of opposition would be to make him a hard master.    Each of the two parties into which the court was divided had zealous  foreign allies. The ministers of Spain, of the Empire, and of the States  General were now as anxious to support Rochester as they had formerly  been to support Halifax. All the influence of Barillon was employed  on the other side; and Barillon was assisted by another French agent,  inferior to him in station, but far superior in abilities, Bonrepaux.  Barillon was not without parts, and possessed in large measure the  graces and accomplishments which then distinguished the French gentry.  But his capacity was scarcely equal to what his great place required. He  had become sluggish and self indulgent, liked the pleasures of society  and of the table better than business, and on great emergencies  generally waited for admonitions and even for reprimands from Versailles  before he showed much activity. [53] Bonrepaux had raised himself from  obscurity by the intelligence and industry which he had exhibited as a  clerk in the department of the marine, and was esteemed an adept in the  mystery of mercantile politics. At the close of the year 1685, he  was sent to London, charged with several special commissions of high  importance. He was to lay the ground for a treaty of commerce; he was to  ascertain and report the state of the English fleets and dockyards;  and he was to make some overtures to the Huguenot refugees, who, it was  supposed, had been so effectually tamed by penury and exile, that they  would thankfully accept almost any terms of reconciliation. The new  Envoy's origin was plebeian, his stature was dwarfish, his countenance  was ludicrously ugly, and his accent was that of his native Gascony:  but his strong sense, his keen penetration, and his lively wit eminently  qualified him for his post. In spite of every disadvantage of birth  and figure he was soon known as a most pleasing companion and as a most  skilful diplomatist. He contrived, while flirting with the Duchess of  Mazarin, discussing literary questions with Waller and Saint Evremond,  and corresponding with La Fontaine, to acquire a considerable knowledge  of English politics. His skill in maritime affairs recommended him to  James, who had, during many years, paid close attention to the business  of the Admiralty, and understood that business as well as he was capable  of understanding anything. They conversed every day long and freely  about the state of the shipping and the dock-yards. The result of this  intimacy was, as might have been expected, that the keen and vigilant  Frenchman conceived a great contempt for the King's abilities and  character. The world, he said, had much overrated His Britannic Majesty,  who had less capacity than Charles, and not more virtues. [54]    The two envoys of Lewis, though pursuing one object, very judiciously  took different paths. They made a partition of the court. Bonrepaux  lived chiefly with Rochester and Rochester's adherents. Barillon's  connections were chiefly with the opposite faction. The consequence was  that they sometimes saw the same event in different points of view.  The best account now extant of the contest which at this time agitated  Whitehall is to be found in their despatches.    As each of the two parties at the Court of James had the support of  foreign princes, so each had also the support of an ecclesiastical  authority to which the King paid great deference. The Supreme Pontiff  was for legal and moderate courses; and his sentiments were expressed by  the Nuncio and by the Vicar Apostolic. [55] On the other side was a body  of which the weight balanced even the weight of the Papacy, the mighty  Order of Jesus.    That at this conjuncture these two great spiritual powers, once, as it  seemed, inseparably allied, should have been opposed to each other, is  a most important and remarkable circumstance. During a period of little  less than a thousand years the regular clergy had been the chief support  of the Holy See. By that See they had been protected from episcopal  interference; and the protection which they had received had been amply  repaid. But for their exertions it is probable that the Bishop of Rome  would have been merely the honorary president of a vast aristocracy of  prelates. It was by the aid of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/244"],[0,"A Study in Scarlet (#11)"],[1,"a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each--fourteen  pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in  the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the  best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on  account of it. That was the reason of his going.'    \"'Well?'    \"'My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave  just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper  is violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed the  door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in  less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.  Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for  drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my  daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train.  He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that  she should fly with him. \"You are of age,\" he said, \"and there is no law  to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl  here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a  princess.\" Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him,  but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the  door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room.  What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds  of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up  I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand.  \"I don't think that fine fellow will trouble us again,\" he said. \"I will  just go after him and see what he does with himself.\" With those words  he took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we  heard of Mr. Drebber's mysterious death.'    \"This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier's lips with many gasps and  pauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I  made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should  be no possibility of a mistake.\"    \"It's quite exciting,\" said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \"What happened  next?\"    \"When Mrs. Charpentier paused,\" the detective continued, \"I saw that the  whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which  I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son  returned.    \"'I do not know,' she answered.    \"'Not know?'    \"'No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.'    \"'After you went to bed?'    \"'Yes.'    \"'When did you go to bed?'    \"'About eleven.'    \"'So your son was gone at least two hours?'    \"'Yes.'    \"'Possibly four or five?'    \"'Yes.'    \"'What was he doing during that time?'    \"'I do not know,' she answered, turning white to her very lips.    \"Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found  out where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and  arrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come  quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, 'I suppose you  are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel  Drebber,' he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his  alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.\"    \"Very,\" said Holmes.    \"He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as  having with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.\"    \"What is your theory, then?\"    \"Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road.  When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of  which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach,  perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so  wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim  into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing  on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the  police on to the wrong scent.\"    \"Well done!\" said Holmes in an encouraging voice. \"Really, Gregson, you  are getting along. We shall make something of you yet.\"    \"I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,\" the detective  answered proudly. \"The young man volunteered a statement, in which he  said that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him,  and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an  old shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this  old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I  think the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is to  think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid  he won't make much of [15] Why, by Jove, here's the very man himself!\"    It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were  talking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness  which generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting.  His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged  and untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting  with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be  embarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling  nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. \"This is a most  extraordinary case,\" he said at last--\"a most incomprehensible affair.\"    \"Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!\" cried Gregson, triumphantly. \"I  thought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the  Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?\"    \"The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,\" said Lestrade gravely, \"was  murdered at Halliday's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning.\"          CHAPTER VII. LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.      THE intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so  unexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang  out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I  stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his  brows drawn down over his eyes.    \"Stangerson too!\" he muttered. \"The plot thickens.\"    \"It was quite thick enough before,\" grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.  \"I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.\"    \"Are you--are you sure of this piece of intelligence?\" stammered  Gregson.    \"I have just come from his room,\" said Lestrade. \"I was the first to  discover what had occurred.\"    \"We have been hearing Gregson's view of the matter,\" Holmes observed.  \"Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?\"    \"I have no objection,\" Lestrade answered, seating himself. \"I freely  confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in  the death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was  completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out  what had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston  Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the  morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which  confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between  8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards.  I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning  them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling  upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You  see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated,  the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the  vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next  morning.\"    \"They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\"  remarked Holmes.    \"So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making  enquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and  at eight o'clock I reached Halliday's Private Hotel, in Little George  Street. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there,  they at once answered me in the affirmative.    \"'No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,' they said. 'He  has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.'    \"'Where is he now?' I asked.    \"'He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.'    \"'I will go up and see him at once,' I said.    \"It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and  lead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me  the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor  leading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to  go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in  spite of my twenty years' experience. From under the door there curled  a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and  formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry,  which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door  was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it  in. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled  up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had  been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned  him over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman  who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause  of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated  the heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you  suppose was above the murdered man?\"    I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,  even before Sherlock Holmes answered.    \"The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\" he said.    \"That was it,\" said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all  silent for a while.
