Now when [the Babis] found themselves unable to treat this humor by any  means (for, strive as they would, they were foiled and frustrated), and  when they failed to find any remedy for this disorder or any fairness in  this flower, they deliberated and hesitated for nine months, and at length  a certain number of them, to stop further mischief, enrolled themselves as  subjects of the Sublime Ottoman Government, that [thereby] they might  assuage this tumult. By means of this device the mischief was allayed, and  the consul withdrew his hand from molesting them; but he notified this  occurrence to the Royal Court in a manner at variance with the facts and  contrary to the truth, and, together with the confederate _Sh_ay_kh_s,  applied himself in every way to devices for distracting the senses [of the  Babis]. Finally, however, being dismissed, and overwhelmed with disaster,  he became penitent and sorry.    Let us proceed with our original topic. For eleven years and somewhat  over, Baha'u'llah abode in 'Iraq-i-'Arab. The behavior and conduct of the  sect were such that [His] fame and renown increased. For He was manifest  and apparent amongst men, consorted and associated with all parties, and  would converse familiarly with doctors and scholars concerning the  solution of difficult theological questions and the verification of the  true sense of abstruse points of divinity. As is currently reported by  persons of every class, He used to please all, whether inhabitants or  visitors, by His kindly intercourse and courteous address; and this sort  of demeanor and conduct on His part led them to suspect sorcery and  account Him an adept in the occult sciences.    During this period Mirza Yahya remained concealed and hidden, continuing  and abiding in his former conduct and behavior, until, when the edict for  the removal of Baha'u'llah from Ba_gh_dad was issued by His Majesty the  Ottoman monarch, Mirza Yahya would neither quit nor accompany [Him]: at  one time he meditated setting out for India, at another settling in  Turkistan; but, being unable to decide on either of these two plans, he  finally, at his own wish, set out before all in the garb of a dervish, in  disguise and change of raiment, for Karkuk and Arbil. Thence, by  continuous advance, he reached Mosul, where, on the arrival of the main  body, he took up his abode and station alongside their caravan. And  although throughout this journey the governors and officials observed the  utmost consideration and respectfulness, while march and halt were alike  dignified and honorable, nevertheless was he always concealed in change of  raiment, and acted cautiously, on the idea that some act of aggression was  likely to occur.    In this fashion did they reach Constantinople, where they were appointed  quarters in a guesthouse on the part of the glorious Ottoman monarchy. And  at first the utmost attention was paid to them in every way. On the third  day, because of the straitness of their quarters and the greatness of  their numbers, they migrated and moved to another house. Certain of the  nobles came to see and converse with them, and these, as is related,  behaved with moderation. Notwithstanding that many in their assemblies and  gatherings continued to condemn and vilify them saying, \"This sect are a  mischief to all the world and destructive of treaties and covenants; they  are a source of trouble and baleful to all lands; they have kindled a fire  and consumed the earth; and though they be outwardly fair-seeming yet are  they deserving of every chastisement and punishment,\" yet still the Babis  continued to conduct themselves with patience, calmness, deliberation, and  constancy, so that they did not, even in self-defense, importune [the  occupants of] high places or frequent the houses of any of the magnates of  that kingdom. Whomsoever amongst the great He [Baha] interviewed on His  own account, they met, and no word save of sciences and arts passed  between them; until certain noblemen sought to guide Him, and loosed their  tongues in friendly counsel, saying, \"To appeal, to state your case, and  to demand justice is a measure demanded by custom.\" He replied in answer,  \"Pursuing the path of obedience to the King's command We have come to this  country. Beyond this We neither had nor have any aim or desire that We  should appeal and cause trouble. What is [now] hidden behind the veil of  destiny will in the future become manifest. There neither has been nor is  any necessity for supplication and importunity. If the enlightened-minded  leaders [of your nation] be wise and diligent, they will certainly make  inquiry, and acquaint themselves with the true state of the case; if not,  then [their] attainment of the truth is impracticable and impossible.  Under these circumstances what need is there for importuning statesmen and  supplicating ministers of the Court? We are free from every anxiety, and  ready and prepared for the things predestined to Us. 'Say, all is from  God'(24) is a sound and sufficient argument, and 'if God toucheth thee  with a hurt there is no dispeller thereof save Him'(25) is a healing  medicine.\"    After some months a royal edict was promulgated appointing Adrianople in  the district of Roumelia as their place of abode and residence. To that  city the Babis, accompanied by [Turkish] officers, proceeded all together,  and there they made their home and habitation. According to statements  heard from sundry travelers and from certain great and learned men of that  city, they behaved and conducted themselves there also in such wise that  the inhabitants of the district and the government officials used to  eulogize them, and all used to show them respect and deference. In short,  since Baha'u'llah was wont to hold intercourse with the doctors, scholars,  magnates, and nobles [thereby] obtaining fame and celebrity throughout  Roumelia, the materials of comfort were gathered together, neither fear  nor dread remained, they reposed on the couch of ease, and passed their  time in quietude, when one Siyyid Muhammad by name, of Isfahan, one of the  followers [of the Bab], laid the foundations of intimacy and familiarity  with Mirza Yahya, and [thereby] became the cause of vexation and trouble.  In other words, he commenced a secret intrigue and fell to tempting Mirza  Yahya, saying, \"The fame of this sect hath risen high in the world, and  their name hath become noble: neither dread nor danger remaineth, nor is  there any fear or [need for] caution before you. Cease, then, to follow,  that thou mayest be followed by the world; and come out from amongst  adherents, that thou mayest become celebrated throughout the horizons.\"  Mirza Yahya, too, through lack of reflection and thought as to  consequences, and want of experience, became enamored of his words and  befooled by his conduct. This one was [like] the sucking child, and that  one became as the much-prized breast. At all events, how much soever some  of the chiefs of the sect wrote admonitions and pointed out to him the  path of discretion saying, \"For many a year hast thou been nurtured in thy  brother's arms and hast reposed on the pillow of ease and gladness; what  thoughts are these which are the results of madness? Be not beguiled by  this empty name,(26) which, out of regard for certain considerations and  as a matter of expediency, was bestowed [upon thee]; neither seek to be  censured by the community. Thy rank and worth depend on a word, and thine  exaltation and elevation were for a protection and a consideration,\" yet  still, the more they admonished him, the less did it affect him; and how  much soever they would direct him, he continued to account opposition as  identical with advantage. Afterwards, too, the fire of greed and avarice  was kindled, and although there was no sort of need, their circumstances  being easy in the extreme, they fell to thinking of salary and stipend,  and certain of the women dependent on Mirza Yahya went to the [governor's]  palace and craved assistance and charity. So when Baha'u'llah beheld such  conduct and behavior on his part He dismissed and drove away both [him and  Siyyid Muhammad] from Himself.    Then Siyyid Muhammad set out for Constantinople to get his stipend, and  opened the door of suffering. According to the account given, this matter  caused the greatest sorrow and brought about cessation of intercourse. In  Constantinople, moreover, he presumptuously set afloat certain reports,  asserting, amongst other things, that the notable personage who had come  from 'Iraq was Mirza Yahya. Sundry individuals, perceiving that herein was  excellent material for mischief-making and a means for the promotion of  mutiny, ostensibly supported and applauded him, and stimulated and incited  him, saying, \"You are really the chief support and acknowledged successor:  act with authority, in order that grace and blessing may become apparent.  The waveless sea hath no sound, and the cloud without thunder raineth no  rain.\" By such speech, then, was that unfortunate man entrapped into his  course of action, and led to utter vain words which caused the disturbance  of [men's] thoughts. Little by little those who were wont to incite and  encourage began without exception to utter violent denunciations in every  nook and corner, nay in the court itself, saying, \"The Babis say thus, and  expound in this wise: [their] behavior is such, and [their] speech  so-and-so.\" Such mischief-making and plots caused matters to become  misapprehended, and furthermore certain schemes got afloat which were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19312"],[0,"Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas (#11)"],[1,"save God!  Blessed ye are, O ye pure and chaste ones! Glad-tidings be unto you  through the gift of the Covenant, from the light of which all regions are  illuminated! Be rejoiced that the lights of the Sun of Truth are shining  forth unto all parts; be gladdened at the gifts of your Lord, which have  surrounded all the universe; dilate your breasts by chanting the verses of  God, and console your eyes by witnessing the bounties of the Supreme  Concourse.    By God, the True One, verily, the angels of heaven praise you every morn  and eve from the loftiest apex, and announce to you a favor which will  surely appear as clear and lucid as the sun in mid-day. Then your faces  will shine with a light which will gleam forth unison and harmony, in  diffusing the fragrances of God, in preaching the Beauty of El-ABHA, and  promoting the word of God. Let each one of you be attracted to the love of  the other, so that ye may become as fountains flowing from one source,  stars beaming with one life, myrtles verdant and flourishing by the  abundance of one rain. By this your hearts will be purified, your  consciences illumined, your souls made clear, your banners hoisted, and ye  will become signs of guidance among the maid-servants, standards of  chastity and piety throughout all the nations of the earth, and the  appearances of the gifts of your Lord among women.    Verily, I implore God to gaze upon you with the eye of His mercy, to raise  you through a godlike power, to move you by the breezes of His glory, to  make you fluent in irrefutable and divine proofs and arguments, to sever  you from the world and all therein, to purify and sanctify you from every  material grade, and enable you to diffuse the bounties of the Divine  Worlds.          \"O ye maid-servants of the Merciful!...\"      O ye maid-servants of the Merciful!    Be rejoiced with the glad-tidings of God and thank your Lord for that He  assembled you in the brilliant gathering with illumined faces, pure  hearts, wherein the mysteries of God are printed, and spirits gladdened by  the fragrances of God. This is from His favor to you in this glorious  century.    I ask God to adorn your heads with the pearls of His favor, to ignite in  your hearts the fire of the love of God, to free your tongues in utterance  of eloquent words and excellent meanings and mysteries in the gathering of  the pious, to make ye roses of the paradise of El-ABHA, angels of heaven,  united in opinions, harmonious in thoughts and to manifest in your faces  signs of holiness of the Kingdom among the people.    Soon will your Lord make you growing trees in His wonderful vineyard,  blossoming, leafing and bearing fruits of the paradise of El-ABHA through  the shadow of His Name, the Merciful, the Clement.          \"O ye crying voices in the region of America!...\"      O ye(27) crying voices in the region of America!    Make level the path of the Covenant of God! BE firm in the Alliance of  God!    I surely read your answer to my words, and my heart overflowed with joy  and fragrance, when I heard of your supplication to God, and of your  entreaty to God, and of your begging assistance of God, and of your  endeavor in the service of the Cause of God, and of your effort in  publishing the Alliance of God, and of your yearning after and your  longing for harmony and union in the love of God.    Ye shall soon behold the lights of confirmation shining forth unto your  hearts and your spirits from the Kingdom of ABHA.    Stand up, as the standing of the souls by whose lights of sincerity in the  Cause of God the horizons are shining, and guard the sheep of God with the  staff of the instructions of God.    I beg God to confirm thee to His will, as He confirmed the Apostles (of  Jesus) aforetime.    I know, verily, that the universal, never ending, eternal, bright and  divine establishments are only the diffusing of the breaths of God, and  the spreading of the instructions of God, and all that are beside these,  though they be the reigning over all the regions of the earth, or the  construction of railroads from the earth to the heavens, or means of  transportation with the rapidity of rising lightning from the globe of  earth to the globe of the sun, all are but mortal, perishing, demolishing  and disadvantageous, in comparison with the divine establishments. Because  the latter (divine establishments) are intrinsic matters, while the former  are but metaphorical matters; the latter are truth, while the former are  imaginary.    Verily, I yearn after your visit as the yearning of the thirsty after the  fountain of the water of Euphrates (agreeable water), but at present your  remaining in that region (America) is obligatory. Please God, when it will  be the occasion, I will inform you to come; and (now) I will  circumambulate instead of you the Holy Tomb.(28) Glory be upon you!          \"O thou son of the associate and companion of Abdul-Baha!...\"      O thou son of the associate and companion(29) of Abdul-Baha!    You brought many letters with you from those regions, but on account of  the great disturbance it was not possible to write the answers. You saw  what a commotion was set up in the Blessed Spot(30) throught the  instigation of the jealous brother. It still continues. Therefore you must  apologize: Say that Abdul-Baha has considered every one of the letters  with the eyes of the spirit, has read each, and through the valid  messenger--that is, through the spiritual susceptibilities--has sent each  the message of peace and greeting. Therefore, let them turn to the blessed  and Radiant Spot with a pure heart and an attracted spirit, that they may  receive answer through the lights radiating therefrom.    Communication is not confined to writing. This is a trace, while the  spiritual message is fruitful and effective. That is the essential, and  without it communication is useless.          \"O Thou kind God! That scattered assembly is...\"      O Thou kind God! That scattered assembly(31) is Thine, and that gathering  of friends is of Thee. Their eyes are opened, their hearts in tune with  Thy love, and their ears in communion with Thy hidden mysteries.    O Thou who art self-sufficient! Let a beautiful song reach this people  from the birds of that garden, that they may warble, rejoice and be happy,  implore and supplicate the Lord.    O Thou Educator! Train that assembly of the righteous; comfort them; set  their hearts aglow with the fire of Thy love; acquaint them with Thy  mystery and commune with them, so that they may find Thy kingdom of  mysteries, become of the people of piety and leading in liberty.    Grant them the soul immortal; enrich them above the world, and detach them  from the world; usher them into the tent of Thy Kingdom and give them a  portion of the divine bounty.    Bestow upon them the everlasting life and bless them with the new  teachings. Make every one a lighted torch and a warbling nightingale--the  king of the rose in the garden. Reveal to them Thine attractive beauty;  make each a growing tree on the shore of Thy guidance, bearing the fruit  of Thy grace. Thus may the East illumine the West and the West become the  East of the Supreme Heaven.    Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Almighty, and verily Thou art the  Precious, the Omnipotent, the Omniscient!          \"O ye my divine friends!...\"      O ye my divine friends!(32)    At a time when the sea of tests had become tempestuous and the waves of  calamity were heaving and the hosts of nations were in the utmost violence  and the people of oppression dealt with infinite injustice, some of the  calumniators, uniting with our unkind brother, wrote a letter replete with  false accusations and engaged in seditions and calumnies.    They confused the mind of the government and agitated the state  authorities. From this it is evident how a prisoner in this ruined walled  city would fare and how the conditions are so full of perplexity and  confusion as to baffle all description! Notwithstanding, this imprisoned  exile is in the utmost firmness and calmness, trusts in His Highness the  Peerless God, and wishes for every calamity and affliction in the path of  the love of God! (To us) the arrow of oppression is a rich flow of divine  bounty, and deadly poison is a swift-healing antidote.    We were in such a state when a letter came from the friends in America.  The whole of its contents showed an agreement on their part to be in unity  and harmony in all respects, and it was signed by all, determined to be  self-sacrificing in the path of the love of God, in order thus to secure  eternal life.    Upon perusing that letter and looking at the name signed to it, such a joy  and gladness came over Abdul-Baha as is beyond description, and he thanked  God that such friends are found in that country, who in utmost joy and  fragrance are in union and accord and one in agreement with each other.  The more this Covenant is strengthened, the happier, the better, the  sweeter it will be and it will thus attract the divine confirmations. If  the friends of God are wishing for confirmation in order to enjoy the  friendship of the Supreme Concourse, they must exert themselves to confirm  and strengthen this Covenant; for the making of a covenant, and an  alliance for brotherhood and unity is like unto the irrigation of the tree  of life which is conducive to eternal life!    Briefly, O ye friends of God! Make your feet firm, make a firm compact,  and in union and accord endeavor to diffuse the fragrance of the love of  God and to spread the divine teachings, in order that ye may impart life  to the dead body of this world, and bestow a real healing on every one  diseased (in soul).    O ye friends of God! The world is like the body of man--it hath become  sick, feeble and infirm. Its eye is devoid of sight, its ear hath become  destitute of hearing and its faculties of sense are entirely dissolved.  The friends of God"]]]
