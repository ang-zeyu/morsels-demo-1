Though moderate in his private deportment, he knew  how to adopt in his public counsels that magnanimity which suits the  minister of a great state. It was ever his maxim, that no independent  government should yield to another any evident point of reason or  equity; and that all such concessions, so far from preventing war,  served to no other purpose than to provoke fresh claims and insults.  By his management a spirit of union was preserved in all the provinces;  great sums were levied; and a navy was equipped, composed of larger  ships than the Dutch had ever built before, and able to cope with the  fleet of England.    {1665.} As soon as certain intelligence arrived of De Ruyter's  enterprises, Charles declared war against the states. His fleet,  consisting of one hundred and fourteen sail, besides fireships and  ketches, was commanded by the duke of York, and under him by Prince  Rupert and the earl of Sandwich. It had about twenty-two thousand men on  board. Obdam, who was admiral of the Dutch navy, of nearly equal force,  declined not the combat. In the heat of action, when engaged in close  fight with the duke of York, Obdam's ship blew up. This accident much  discouraged the Dutch, who fled towards their own coast. Tromp alone,  son of the famous admiral killed during the former war, bravely  sustained with his squadron the efforts of the English, and protected  the rear of his countrymen. The vanquished had nineteen ships sunk and  taken. The victors lost only one. Sir John Lawson died soon after of  his wounds. It is affirmed, and with an appearance of reason, that this  victory might have been rendered more complete, had not orders been  issued to slacken sail by Brounker, one of the duke's bed-chamber, who  pretended authority from his master. The duke disclaimed the orders;  but Brounker never was sufficiently punished for his temerity.[*] It is  allowed, however, that the duke behaved with great bravery during the  action. He was long in the thickest of the fire. The earl of Falmouth,  Lord Muskerry, and Mr. Boyle, were killed by one shot at his side, and  covered him all over with their brains and gore. And it is not likely,  that, in a pursuit, where even persons of inferior station, and of the  most cowardly disposition, acquire courage, a commander should feel his  spirits to flag ana should turn from the back of an enemy, whose face he  had not been afraid to encounter.         * King James, in his Memoirs, gives an account of       this affair different from what we meet with in any       historian. He says, that, while he was asleep, Brounker       brought orders to Sir John Harman, captain of the ship, to       slacken sail. Sir John remonstrated, but obeyed. After some       time, finding that his falling back was likely to produce       confusion in the fleet, he hoisted the sail as before; so       that the prince, coming soon after on the quarter deck, and       finding all things as he left them, knew nothing of what had       passed during his repose. Nobody gave him the least       intimation of it. It was long after that he heard of it, by       a kind of accident; and he intended to have punished       Brounker by martial law; but just about that time, the house       of commons took up the question, and impeached him, which       made it impossible for the duke to punish him otherwise than       by dismissing him his service. Brounker, before the house,       never pretended that he had received any orders from the       duke.    This disaster threw the Dutch into consternation, and determined De Wit,  who was the soul of their councils, to exert his military capacity, in  order to support the declining courage of his countrymen. He went on  board the fleet, which he took under his command; and he soon remedied  all those disorders which had been occasioned by the late misfortune.  The genius of this man was of the most extensive nature. He quickly  became as much master of naval affairs, as if he had from his infancy  been educated in them; and he even made improvements in some parts of  pilotage and sailing, beyond what men expert in those arts had ever been  able to attain.    The misfortunes of the Dutch determined their allies to act for their  assistance and support. The king of France was engaged in a defensive  alliance with the states; but as his naval force was yet in its infancy,  he was extremely averse, at that time, from entering into a war with so  formidable a power as England. He long tried to mediate a peace between  the states, and for that purpose sent an embassy to London, which  returned without effecting any thing. Lord Hollis, the English  ambassador at Paris, endeavored to draw over Lewis to the side of  England; and, in his master's name, made him the most tempting offers.  Charles was content to abandon all the Spanish Low Countries to the  French, without pretending to a foot of ground for himself, provided  Lewis would allow him to pursue his advantages against the Dutch.[*]  But the French monarch, though the conquest of that valuable territory  was the chief object of his ambition, rejected the offer as contrary to  his interests: he thought, that if the English had once established an  uncontrollable dominion over the sea and over commerce, they would  soon be able to render his acquisitions a dear purchase to him. When De  Lionne, the French secretary, assured Van Beuninghen, ambassador of  the states, that this offer had been pressed on his master during six  months, \"I can readily believe it,\" replied the Dutchman; \"I am sensible  that it is the interest of England.\"[**]         * D'Estrades, December 19, 1664.         ** D'Estrades, August 14, 1665.    Such were the established maxims at that time with regard to the  interests of princes. It must, however, be allowed, that the politics of  Charles, in making this offer, were not a little hazardous. The extreme  weakness of Spain would have rendered the French conquests easy and  infallible; but the vigor of the Dutch, it might be foreseen, would make  the success of the English much more precarious. And even were the  naval force of Holland totally annihilated, the acquisition of the Dutch  commerce to England could not be relied on as a certain consequence; nor  is trade a constant attendant of power, but depends on many other, and  some of them very delicate, circumstances.    Though the king of France was resolved to support the Hollanders in  that unequal contest in which they were engaged, he yet protracted his  declaration, and employed the time in naval preparations, both in  the ocean and the Mediterranean. The king of Denmark, meanwhile, was  resolved not to remain an idle spectator of the contest between the  maritime powers. The part which he acted was the most extraordinary: he  made a secret agreement with Charles to seize all the Dutch ships in his  harbors, and to share the spoils with the English, provided they would  assist him in executing this measure. In order to increase his prey,  he perfidiously invited the Dutch to take shelter in his ports; and  accordingly the East India fleet, very richly laden, had put into  Bergen. Sandwich, who now commanded the English navy, (the duke having  gone ashore,) despatched Sir Thomas Tiddiman with a squadron to attack  them; but whether from the king of Denmark's delay in sending orders to  the governor, or, what is more probable, from his avidity in endeavoring  to engross the whole booty, the English admiral, though he behaved with  great bravery, failed of his purpose. The Danish governor fired upon  him; and the Dutch, having had leisure to fortify themselves, made a  gallant resistance.    The king of Denmark, seemingly ashamed of his conduct, concluded with  Sir Gilbert Talbot, the English envoy, an offensive alliance against  the states; and at the very same time, his resident at the Hague, by his  orders, concluded an offensive alliance against England. To this latter  alliance he adhered, probably from jealousy of the increasing naval  power of England; and he seized and confiscated all the English ships in  his harbors. This was a sensible check to the advantages which Charles  had obtained over the Dutch. Not only a blow was given to the English  commerce; the king of Denmark's naval force was also considerable, and  threatened every moment a conjunction with the Hollanders. That prince  stipulated to assist his ally with a fleet of thirty sail; and he  received in return a yearly subsidy of one million five hundred thousand  crowns, of which three hundred thousand were paid by France.    The king endeavored to counterbalance these confederacies by acquiring  new friends and allies. He had despatched Sir Richard Fanshaw into  Spain, who met with a very cold reception. That monarchy was sunk into  a state of weakness, and was menaced with an invasion from France;  yet could not any motive prevail with Philip to enter into cordial  friendship with England. Charles's alliance with Portugal, the detention  of Jamaica and Tangiers, the sale of Dunkirk to the French, all these  offences sunk so deep in the mind of the Spanish monarch, that no motive  of interest was sufficient to outweigh them.    The bishop of Munster was the only ally that Charles could acquire. This  prelate, a man of restless enterprise and ambition, had entertained a  violent animosity against the states and he was easily engaged, by  the promise of subsidies from England, to make an incursion on that  republic. With a tumultuary army of near twenty thousand men, he invaded  her territories, and met with weak resistance. The land forces of the  states were as feeble and ill governed, as their fleets were gallant  and formidable. But after his committing great ravages in several of the  provinces, a stop was put to the progress of this warlike prelate.  He had not military skill sufficient to improve the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19217"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.II. (#11)"],[1,"on both sides; and where the odds were so  great, the victor could not reap much glory. Herbert retired to  the isles of Scilly, where he expected a reinforcement; but being  disappointed in this expectation, he returned to Portsmouth in very  ill humour, with which his officers and men were infected. The common  sailors still retained some attachment to James, who had formerly been  a favourite among them; and the officers complained that they had been  sent upon this service with a force so much inferior to that of the  enemy. King William, in order to appease their discontent, made an  excursion to Portsmouth, where he dined with the admiral on board  the ship Elizabeth, declared his intention of making him an earl in  consideration of his good conduct and services, conferred the honour of  knighthood on the captains Ashby and Shovel, and bestowed a donation of  ten shillings on every private sailor.          DIVERS SENTENCES REVERSED.    The parliament of England thought it incumbent upon them not only to  raise supplies for the maintenance of the war in which the nation was  involved, but also to do justice with respect to those who had been  injured by illegal or oppressive sentences in the late reigns. The  attainders of lord Russel, Algernon Sidney, alderman Cornish, and lady  Lisle, were now reversed. A committee of privileges was appointed by  the lords to examine the case of the earl of Devonshire, who in the  late reign had been fined thirty thousand pounds for assaulting colonel  Culpepper in the presence-chamber. They reported that the court of  king's bench, in overruling the earl's plea of privilege of parliament,  had committed a manifest breach of privilege; that the fine was  excessive and exhorbitant, against the great charter, the common right  of the subject, and the law of the realm. The sentence pronounced upon  Samuel Johnson, chaplain to lord Russel, in consequence of which he  had been degraded, fined, scourged, and set in the pillory, was now  annulled, and the commons recommended him to his majesty for some  ecclesiastical preferment. He received one thousand pounds in money,  with a pension of three hundred pounds for his own life and that of his  son, who was moreover gratified with a place of one hundred pounds a  year; but the father never obtained any ecclesiastical benefice. Titus  Oates seized this opportunity of petitioning the house of lords for a  reversal of the judgments given against him on his being convicted of  perjury. The opinions of all the judges and counsel at the bar were  heard on this subject, and a bill of reversal passed the commons; but  the peers having inserted some amendments and a proviso, a conference  was demanded, and violent heats ensued. Oates, however, was released  from confinement, and the lords, with the consent of the commons,  recommended him to his majesty for a pardon, which he obtained, together  with a comfortable pension. The committee appointed to inquire into the  cases of the state-prisoners, found sir Robert Wright, late lord chief  justice, to have been concerned in the cruelties committed in the west  after the insurrection of Monmouth; as also one of the ecclesiastical  commissioners, and guilty of manifold enormities. Death had by this time  delivered Jefferies from the resentment of the nation. Graham and Burton  had acted as solicitors in the illegal prosecutions carried on against  those who opposed the court in the reign of Charles II.; these were now  reported guilty of having been instrumental in taking away the lives and  estates of those who had suffered the loss of either under colour of  law for eight years last past; of having, by malicious indictments,  informations, and prosecutions of _quo warranto_, endeavoured the  subversion of the protestant religion, and the government of the realm;  and of having wasted many thousand pounds of the public revenue in the  course of their infamous practices.          INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSE OF MISCARRIAGES IN IRELAND.    Nor did the misconduct of the present ministry escape the animadversion  of the parliament. The lords having addressed the king to put the  Isle of Wight, Jersey, Guernsey, Scilly, Dover-castle, and the other  fortresses of the kingdom, in a posture of defence, and to disarm the  papists, empowered a committee to inquire into the miscarriages in  Ireland, which were generally imputed to the neglect of the marquisses  of Caermarthan and Halifax. They presented an address to the king,  desiring the minute-book of the committee for Irish affairs might be  put into their hands; but his majesty declined gratifying them in this  particular: then the commons voted that those persons who had advised  the king to delay this satisfaction were enemies to the kingdom.  William, alarmed at this resolution, allowed them to inspect the book,  in which they found very little for their purpose. The house resolved,  that an address should be presented to his majesty, declaring that the  succour of Ireland had been retarded by unnecessary delays; that the  transports prepared were not sufficient to convey the forces to that  kingdom; and that several ships had been taken by the enemy, for want  of proper convoy. At the same time the question was put, whether or not  they should address the king against the marquis of Halifax. But it was  carried in the negative by a small majority. Before this period, Howe,  vice-chamberlain to the queen, had moved for an address against such  counsellors as had been impeached in parliament, and betrayed the  liberties of the nation. This motion was levelled at Caemarthen and  Halifax, the first of whom had been formerly impeached of high treason,  under the title of earl of Danby; and the other was charged with all the  misconduct of the present administration. Warm debates ensued, and in  all probability the motion would have been carried in the affirmative,  had not those who spoke warmly in behalf it suddenly cooled in the  course of the dispute. Some letters from king James to his partisans  being intercepted, and containing some hints of an intended invasion,  Mr. Hambden, chairman of the committee of the whole house, enlarged upon  the imminent danger to which the kingdom was exposed, and moved for  a further supply to his majesty. In this unexpected motion he was not  seconded by one member. The house, however, having taken the letters  into consideration, resolved to draw up an address to the king, desiring  him to secure and disarm all papists of note; and they brought in a bill  for attainting several persons in rebellion against their majesties; but  it was not finished during this session.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          BILLS PASSED IN THIS SESSION.    Another bill being prepared in the house of lords, enjoining the  subjects to wear the woollen manufacture at certain seasons of the year,  a petition was presented against it by the silk-weavers of London and  Canterbury, assembled in a tumultuous manner at Westminster. The  lords refused their petition, because this was an unusual manner of  application. They were persuaded to return to their respective places  of abode; precautions were taken against a second riot; and the bill was  unanimously rejected in the upper house. This parliament passed an act,  vesting in the two universities the presentations belonging to papists:  those of the southern counties being given to Oxford; and those of  the northern to Cambridge, on certain specified conditions, Courts of  conscience were erected at Bristol, Gloucester, and Newcastle; and that  of the marches of Wales was abolished as an intolerable oppression. The  protestant clergymen, who had been forced to leave their benefices in  Ireland, were rendered capable of holding any living in England, without  forfeiting their title to their former preferment, with the proviso that  they should resign their English benefices when restored to 'those  they had been obliged to relinquish. The statute of Henry IV. against  multiplying gold and silver was now repealed; the subjects were allowed  to melt and refine metals and ores, and extract gold and silver from  them, on condition that it should be brought to the Mint, and converted  into money, the owners receiving its full value in current coin. These,  and several other bills of smaller importance being passed, the two  houses adjourned to the twentieth clay of September, and afterwards to  the nineteenth day of October.
