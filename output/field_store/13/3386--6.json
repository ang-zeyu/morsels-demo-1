Gwen and Dick picked their way carefully along. There was  scarcely need for Mr. Gascoyne's warning; each felt the entire  necessity for extreme caution. Peeping over the edges of the chasms  they could see green ferns growing in splendid clumps in clefts of the  rock, and farther down darkness or a glint of water.    \"Ugh! It would be horrible to tumble there!\" declared Gwen, shivering  as she gazed into the dim depths. \"You don't feel as if you'd ever  come up again, do you? Why, what's that? Did you hear?\"    \"Nothing but the gulls.\"    \"It's like someone shouting. There it is again--behind us.\"    \"By Jove! it is someone calling. Has anybody slipped down one of these  holes? We'd best go and see, but do be careful. Hello, there! We're  coming!\"    Walking, as Gwen had said, like cautious cats, they threaded their way  along the narrow strips of land till they reached the particular chasm  whence the shouts issued. Looking over, they could see on a ledge  about six feet down a little corduroyed, blue-jerseyed figure, and a  frightened, freckled face that peered upwards. Gwen recognized the  urchin in a moment: it was Johnnie Cass, the scapegrace of a family of  fisher folk who lived in the village, and the naughtiest boy in  Winnie's Sunday School class. He was in no immediate danger, for the  ledge was wide, but the wall of rock above him was too steep to admit  of his climbing up.    \"Johnnie, what are you doing down there?\" she called.    \"Oh! boo-hoo-hoo!\" wailed the scared voice from below. \"I were  reachin' after a sea-gurt with a broke wing and down I cooms!\"    \"Serve you right, too! How do you intend getting back?\"    \"I don't know--I wish my mother was 'ere!\" and again he broke into a  howl of woe.    \"I'm glad she's not--she'd make a worse noise than you, from my  experience of her,\" murmured Gwen. \"Look here!\" she continued, turning  to Dick, \"I suppose we've got to fish this little wretch up somehow.\"    \"If I reach down can you catch hold of my hand and let me pull you?\"  shouted Dick to the snivelling Johnnie.    \"Nay! I durstn't stir an inch--oh! where's my mother?\"    \"He's lost his nerve--that's what's the damage. If I go down for him  could you give me a haul back?\"    Gwen shook her head.    \"You're too heavy. Better do it the other way. I'll go down, hand up  the kid, and then you shall pull me back. Nonsense! I'm not bothered  with nerves. Shan't mind in the least!\"    It seemed the more feasible plan, for the six feet of rock that  sheered down to the ledge was so steep and smooth of surface as to  render it impossible for anyone to climb it without assistance; and it  would be comparatively easy for Dick to drag Gwen's lighter weight to  the top, though a difficult matter for her to pull him. If her heart  went into her mouth as she let herself over the edge, Gwen did not  show it. She was not given to exhibiting the white feather, and both  at school and at home kept up a well-deserved reputation for pluck.  Five seconds landed her by Johnnie's side, and once there she tried  not to look into the gulf below. After some amount of cajoling, she  persuaded the young rascal to take his dirty little fists out of his  eyes, and allow himself to be hoisted up within reach of Dick's firm  grip; then a successful heave did the rest. Johnnie was soon in  safety, but it was much harder work for Gwen to follow; there was  nobody to boost her, and not an inch of ledge on the rock to make a  foothold.    \"It's good practice for Alpine climbing!\" she gasped, as with  dishevelled hair and grazed face she at last scrambled back. \"I  thought my arms were being dislocated.\"    Dick was rubbing his own arms ruefully, but he did not complain. He  had turned very white. Perhaps the effort of pulling up two people had  been rather too much for him. Gwen suddenly remembered with  compunction that he was ill, and not even allowed the exertion of  golf, much less \"footer\". She wished she had thought of it before and  gone to the lighthouse for help.    \"I'm an idiot,\" she told herself. \"It was I who suggested he should do  the hauling part. I hope he hasn't done himself any harm.\"    Meantime Johnnie Cass stood surveying Gwen with the grin of Puck.    \"Yer face is bleedin', and yer hair's all over yer eyes. Aye, yer do  look a sight!\" he volunteered.    Gwen shook him! She really couldn't help it; it relieved her feelings  so very much. After all, it is rather nervy work to go down a chasm;  and though she wouldn't own that she had minded in the least, her legs  seemed weak and queer, and her hands were hot and trembling, and there  was a funny buzzing sound in her head. She was rather ashamed of  herself for losing her temper, however, and tried suddenly to be  dignified.    \"Johnnie Cass,\" she protested solemnly, \"you ought to be grateful to  me for saving your life instead of making impertinent remarks!\"    Dick burst out laughing.    \"Bravo!\" he said. \"Look here, you kid, if you don't want your head  punched as well you'd best obliterate yourself.\"    Johnnie took the hint and fled away over the moor, bolting for home  with all possible speed and lifting up his voice as he went in a  melancholy howl. Dick and Gwen sat down on a rock to recover  themselves.    \"You've got some pluck--for a girl,\" said Dick, throwing a pebble into  the chasm. \"I didn't expect you'd really go down there and fetch him.  Girls generally stand by and shriek.\"    \"Not modern girls,\" affirmed Gwen. \"They used to do the shrieking  business in oldfashioned novels. It's gone out of fashion since hockey  came in.\"    \"I thought ladies were supposed to scream and wring their slim, fair  hands!\"    \"Shows you haven't got any sisters! Do my hands look slim and fair?\"    \"Well, no, they're a good deal more like a boy's,\" admitted Dick.    \"I often wish I were a boy,\" sighed Gwen regretfully.    \"Don't! You're a jolly sight nicer as you are,\" returned Dick, getting  up to go.    The pair did not reach the Parsonage until after one o'clock, and  Beatrice and Mr. Gascoyne were beginning to wonder what had become of  them.    \"I hope Dick's none the worse,\" said Father rather anxiously when Gwen  poured out the tale of their adventure. \"I'm afraid it's been a tiring  morning for him. He had better stop to lunch and have a good rest  afterwards before he attempts to walk home. I'll go and telephone to  his father from the post office and say we're keeping him. Perhaps Dr.  Chambers will say he mustn't come here again if we let him do rash  things!\"    The family laughed at the humorous account of the rescue of Johnnie  Cass which Dick and Gwen gave at the dinner table.    \"You needn't have expected gratitude from that imp!\" said Winnie, who  had suffered many hard experiences in Sunday School. \"Possibly his  mother may thank you, but I doubt even that.\"    \"All the same Gwen did her best, and that's a satisfaction,\" said  Father. \"Johnnie's a clever little lad in spite of his naughtiness,  and may turn out better than we expect Some day he may even thank you  for having saved his life. Gwen must keep her eye on him. He owes her  so much it ought to make a bond between them.\"    \"Well, I wish her joy of her protege,\" said Winnie, with a dubious  shake of her head.    After that Dick spent many Saturday mornings at the Parsonage. His  father would not allow him to invite his own friends as they always  proved rather too much for him, but the boy was lonely, and found the  Gascoynes pleasant companions. Gwen especially, who was nearest his  own age, became his particular chum, and the two carried out many  experiments together in the way of photography, amateur bookbinding,  and one or two other hobbies in which they were mutually interested.  Dick's lessons with Mr. Gascoyne were over by ten o'clock, and he  generally stayed an hour or two longer, adapting himself so well to  the household that he soon seemed to be almost one of the family.  Giles and Basil adored him, and haunted his footsteps as much as they  were allowed, but their mischievous young fingers generally worked  such havoc among slides and specimens that Gwen was often forced to  turn them out and lock the door upon them.    \"Monkeys from the zoo are tame and well-behaved compared with Stumps  and Bazzie,\" she declared. \"If one wants one's things ruined commend  me to two small brothers!\"    Gwen was delighted to have found so congenial a friend. Beatrice and  Winnie, being both older, were naturally companions for one another  and were inclined to treat her entirely as one of the younger ones,  forgetting how fast she was growing up, and it was difficult to make  childish little Lesbia interested in anything. Here at last was  somebody who appreciated birds' eggs, and butterflies, and collections  of shells, and pressed flowers; someone who did pen-and-ink drawings  a great deal better than herself, and who knew exactly how to make  lantern slides, and could even manage to mend the toy printing press  that Giles had broken.    Dick was clever with his fingers, and as he was not allowed to read  very much he spent long hours at home constructing wonderful boxes for  birds' eggs, or stretchers for butterflies and moths, or preparing  slides for the microscope.    \"I'm going to be a doctor when I grow up,\" he confided to Gwen, \"so  microscopic work will be a help to me. Dad's teaching me a little  scrap of dispensing now, just to amuse me.\"    \"I hope he doesn't let you make up the bottles of medicine!\" laughed  Gwen. \"I pity the patients.\"    \"Rather not, but I see what goes in them. If you'll come over to the  surgery some day I'll make you taste something for laughing!\"    \"We should be lost without Dick now,\" said Gwen one day at tea. \"What  shall we do when he goes back to school?\"    \"I'm afraid that won't be just yet,\" said Mr. Gascoyne. \"He doesn't  get strong as fast as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21688"],[0,"Scottish Cathedrals and Abbeys (#11)"],[1,"enturies.  According to the latest authorities, the following are the probable  dates. The transept was erected about 1224, and may possibly have formed  part of the original Church of the Trinity. The western towers followed  soon after; the western portal somewhat later. The west part of the  north wall of the choir may have been part of the original church, but  the general work of choir, nave, and early chapter-house would appear to  have been carried out during the thirteenth century, and before the  Scottish War of Independence. The cathedral, thus completed, remained  for about a century, when the \"Wolf of Badenoch\" deformed or destroyed  nave and chapter-house. The west front above the portal and the whole of  the nave were reconstructed about the time of Bishop Dunbar (1422-1435),  and the chapter-house by Bishop David Stewart (1482-1501). The  architecture corresponds with their respective periods, and bears their  coats of arms, engraved on each department.[134]    Dr. Thomas Chalmers considered the ruins of Elgin to be the finest  remains of antiquity in Scotland, and as picturesque in their  variety.[135]      6. DIOCESE OF BRECHIN    The two bishoprics of Brechin and Dunblane were formed from the old  Pictish bishopric of Abernethy, in so far as its churches were not yet  absorbed by the growing bishopric of St. Andrews, which immediately  succeeded it.[136] Abernethy was the last of the bishoprics which  existed while the kingdom ruled over by the Scottish dynasty was called  the kingdom of the Picts; St. Andrews was associated with that of the  Scots.[137] Abernethy was from the earliest days dedicated to St. Bride,  and Panbride in the diocese of Brechin, and Kilbride in that of  Dunblane, indicate, in Dr. Skene's view, that the veneration of the  patroness of Abernethy had extended to other churches included in these  dioceses.[138] From this old Pictish diocese the bishopric of Brechin  was formed, towards the end of King David's reign, about 1150.[139] The  Church of Brechin has no claim to represent an old Columban  monastery:[140] its origin as a church is clearly recorded in the  Pictish Chronicle, which states that King Kenneth, son of Malcolm, who  reigned from 971 to 995, gave \"the great city of Brechin to the Lord,\"  founding a church to the Holy Trinity, a monastery apparently after the  Irish model, combined with a Culdee college. We hear of it next in two  charters of David I. to the Church of Deer, and in the second of these  the \"abbot\" of the first appears as \"Bishop of Brechin\" (about 1150).  The abbacy passed to lay hereditary bishops, and the Culdees were first  conjoined with, next distinguished from, and at last superseded by, the  cathedral chapter.[141]    The early Church of Brechin emanated from the Irish Church, and was  assimilated in its character to the Irish monastery. Of the early  connection, there still survives at Brechin the famous Round Tower,  which now occupies the place of a spire at the south-west angle of the  present church. This, with the older one at Abernethy, and the ruined  one at Egilshay in Orkney, are the only surviving types in Scotland.  There were said to have been four others, which are no longer existing,  viz. Deerness in Orkney; West Burray, Tingwall, and Ireland Head, in  Shetland.[142] Dr. Skene gives the date of the Abernethy one as about  870, or between that year and the close of the century, and asserts that  the date of the Brechin tower can be placed with some degree of  certainty late in the succeeding century.[143] Probably it was erected  in the reign of Kenneth (971-995), or about 1012, when Brechin was  destroyed by the Danes.[144] Egilshay probably dates about 1098.[145]  The Brechin tower is capped by a conical stone roof. Dr. Joseph Anderson  shows that those round towers are outliers of a group of which Ireland  is the home;[146] and they were erected during the time when the Celtic  Church was much perplexed by the pillaging attacks of the Danes, that  the ecclesiastics might protect their valuable illuminated manuscripts,  and other costly possessions. The Brechin one corresponds with the Irish  ones, and is built in sixty irregular courses, of blocks of reddish-grey  sandstone, dressed to the curve, but squared at neither top nor bottom;  within, string-courses divide it into seven storeys, the topmost lighted  by four largish apertures facing the cardinal points. A western doorway,  6-2/3 feet from the ground, has inclined jambs and a semicircular head,  all three hewn from single blocks, and the arch being rudely sculptured  with a crucifix, each jamb with a bishop bearing a pastoral staff, and  each corner of the sill with a nondescript crouching animal.[147] The  sculpture on the graceful Tower of Brechin was, there as elsewhere, the  repetition in stone of the illuminated page of the Celtic scribe, who in  turn repeated many of the graceful and varied designs of the  pre-Christian worker in bronze and gold,[148] adding to them Christian  symbols. Dr. Joseph Anderson finds in the figures of the crouching beast  and winged griffin at Brechin a close affinity to the figures of  nondescript creatures carved on the early sculptured memorial  stones.[149]    The cathedral, founded about 1150, and added to at various periods, was  originally a cruciform structure, consisting of a five-bayed nave with  two aisles, late First Pointed mixed with Second Pointed; a transept  formed by an extension of these aisles to the north and south; an  aisleless choir (with lancet windows), the ruins of which are a fine  example of First Pointed work,[150] and which when complete must have  been a very pure and beautiful piece of architecture. The north-west  tower was being constructed in the time of Bishop Patrick (1351-1373),  but must have been a long time in erection. The western doorway presents  the oldest feature of the existing building,[151] and is simple and  massive. The tower and spire are pronounced to be the completest and  best remaining example of their kind in Scotland.[152]    By the alteration of 1806 the choir was reduced, the transepts  demolished, new and wider aisles built on each side of the nave, while  the outer walls of the aisles were carried to such a height that the  whole nave could be covered with a roof of one span, \"thus totally  eclipsing the beautiful windows in the nave, and covering up the  handsome carved cornice of the nail-head quatrefoil description which  ran under the eaves of the nave.\"[153] The cathedral was thus sadly  deformed, but plans of restoration have been recently adopted, funds are  being raised, and the noble minster will before long be restored to its  former grandeur.    The diocese contained thirty parishes, and the bishop sat in the chapter  as Rector of Brechin, that being his prebend.[154]    The Maison Dieu formed part of a hospital, and is an interesting part of  First Pointed work. The rector of the Grammar School is still  \"Praeceptor Domus Dei.\"      7. DIOCESE OF DUNBLANE    Dunblane was an early ecclesiastical centre. Its first church dates back  to the seventh century, and seems to have been an offshoot of the Church  of Kingarth in Bute, the founder of which was St. Blane, whose name is  perpetuated in that of the cathedral town.[155] St. Blane was of the  race of the Irish Picts, and \"bishop\" of the Church of Kingarth which  Cathan his uncle had founded. The church at Dunblane seems to have had a  chequered history, for the ancient town was burned (844-860) by the  Britons of Strathclyde, and in 912 was again ravished by Danish pirates.  Bishop Keith thinks there was a college of Culdees at Dunblane,[156] but  we do not hear anything about it in history, and the important college  was at Muthill, where the Dean of Dunblane afterwards had his seat.  Centres of the Celtic Church were also at the neighbouring Blackford,  Strageath, and Dunning, and they all served their day, until the new  order, inaugurated by Queen Margaret and continued by her successors on  the Scottish throne, was established in the district. About 1150, King  David I. established the bishopric of Dunblane, and about 1198 Earl  Gilbert and his countess introduced canons-regular by the foundation of  the Priory of Inchaffray. Under the growing importance of these centres,  the possession of the Keledei fell into lay hands, and after 1214 the  prior and Keledei of Muthill disappear from the records.[157]    The square tower of Dunblane, which still survives, is a relic of the  structure erected in the twelfth century,[158] and is one of the group,  centred in early Pictavia, revealing characteristics of Norman work, and  all connected with the sites of early Culdee establishments. Those north  of the Tay are at Brechin and Restennet; those south of it, at St.  Andrews (Regulus), Markinch, and Dunblane; Abernethy, Muthill, and  Dunning.[159] The lower four storeys of the Dunblane tower form part of  the original structure; the two highest are evidently of a late  date;[160] the walls are not parallel with those of the nave, and the  tower projects into the south aisle from 6 to 7 feet, and may have been  associated with an earlier church.    The see seems to have fallen into a forlorn condition, for when the  learned Dominican, Clement, was bishop (1233-1258), he made a pilgrimage  to Rome, and represented to the Pope among other things that \"its rents  were barely sufficient to maintain him for six months; there was no  place in the cathedral wherein he could lay his head; there was no  collegiate establishment, and that in this unroofed church, the divine  offices were celebrated by a certain rural chaplain.\"[161] Evidently the  fourth part of the tithes of all the parishes within the diocese were  given for the support of the bishop and the building of the cathedral,  and he left it \"a stately sanctuary, rich in land and heritage, served  by prebendary and canon.\" Bishop Clement built the nave,"]]]
