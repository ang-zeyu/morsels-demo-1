An English writer in 1579, spoke of the English custom of  drinking from \"pots of earth, of sundry colors and moulds, whereof many  are garnished with silver, or leastwise with pewter.\" Such a piece of  stoneware is the oldest authenticated drinking-jug in this country,  which was brought here and used by English colonists. It was the  property of Governor John Winthrop, who came to Boston in 1630, and now  belongs to the American Antiquarian Society, in Worcester,  Massachusetts. It stands eight inches in height, is apparently of German  Gresware, and is heavily mounted in silver. The lid is engraved with a  quaint design of Adam and Eve and the tempting serpent in the  apple-tree. It was a gift to John Winthrop's father from his sister,  Lady Mildmay, in 1607, and was then, and is still now, labelled, \"a  stone Pot tipped and covered with a Silver Lydd.\" Many other Boston  colonists had similar \"stone juggs,\" \"fflanders juggs,\" \"tipt juggs.\"  What were known as \"Fulham juggs\" were also much prized. The most  interesting ones are the Georgius Rex jugs, those marked with a crown,  the initials G. R., or a medallion head of the first of the English  Georges. I know one of these jugs which has a Revolutionary bullet  imbedded in its tough old side, and is not even cracked. Many of them  had pewter or silver lids, which are now missing. Some have the curious  hound handle which was so popular with English potters.    There was no china in common use on the table, and little owned even by  persons of wealth throughout the seventeenth century, either in England  or America. Delft ware was made in several factories in Holland at the  time the Dutch settled in New Netherland; but even in the towns of its  manufacture it was not used for table ware. The pieces were usually of  large size, what were called state pieces, for cabinet and decorative  purposes. The Dutch settlers, however, had \"purslin cupps\" and earthen  dishes in considerable quantities toward the end of the century. The  earthen was possibly Delft ware, and the \"Purslin\" India china, which by  that time was largely imported to Holland. Some Portuguese and Spanish  pottery was imported, but was not much desired, as it was ill fired and  perishable. It was not until Revolutionary times that china was a common  table furnishing; then it began to crowd out pewter. The sudden and  enormous growth of East India commerce, and the vast cargoes of Chinese  pottery and porcelain wares brought to American ports soon gave ample  china to every housewife. In the Southern colonies beautiful isolated  pieces of porcelain, such as vast punch-bowls, often were found in the  homes of opulent planters; but there, as in the North, the first china  for general table use was the handleless tea-cups, usually of some  Canton ware, which crept with the fragrant herb into every woman's  heart--both welcome Oriental waifs.    It may well be imagined that this long narrow table--with a high  salt-cellar in the middle, with clumsy wooden trenchers for plates, with  round pewter platters heaped high with the stew of meat and vegetables,  with a great noggin or two of wood, a can of pewter, or a silver tankard  to drink from, with leather jacks to hold beer or milk, with many wooden  or pewter and some silver spoons, but no forks, no glass, no china, no  covered dishes, no saucers--did not look much like our dinner tables  to-day.    Even the seats were different; there were seldom chairs or stools for  each person. A long narrow bench without a back, called a form, was  placed on each side of the table. Children in many households were not  allowed to sit, even on these uncomfortable forms, while eating. Many  times they had to stand by the side of the table during the entire meal;  in old-fashioned families that uncomfortable and ungracious custom  lasted till this century. I know of children not fifty years ago  standing thus at all meals at the table of one of the Judges of the  Supreme Court. He had a bountiful table, was a hospitable entertainer  and well-known epicure; but children sat not at his board. Each stood at  his own place and had to behave with decorum and eat in entire silence.  In some families children stood behind their parents and other grown  persons, and food was handed back to them from the table--so we are  told. This seems closely akin to throwing food to an animal, and must  have been among people of very low station and social manners.    In other houses they stood at a side-table; and, trencher in hand, ran  over to the great table to be helped to more food when their first  supply was eaten.    The chief thought on the behavior of children at the table, which must  be inferred from all the accounts we have of those times is that they  were to eat in silence, as fast as possible (regardless of indigestion),  and leave the table as speedily as might be. In a little book called _A  Pretty Little Pocket Book_, printed in America about the time of the  Revolution, I found a list of rules for the behavior of children at the  table at that date. They were ordered never to seat themselves at the  table until after the blessing had been asked, and their parents told  them to be seated. They were never to ask for anything on the table;  never to speak unless spoken to; always to break the bread, not to bite  into a whole slice; never to take salt except with a clean knife; not to  throw bones under the table. One rule read: \"Hold not thy knife upright,  but sloping; lay it down at right hand of the plate, with end of blade  on the plate.\" Another, \"Look not earnestly at any other person that is  eating.\" When children had eaten all that had been given them, if they  were \"moderately satisfied,\" they were told to leave at once the table  and room.    When the table-board described herein was set with snowy linen cloth and  napkins, and ample fare, it had some compensations for what modern  luxuries it lacked, some qualifications for inducing contentment  superior even to our beautiful table-settings. There was nothing  perishable in its entire furnishing: no frail and costly china or glass,  whose injury and destruction by clumsy or heedless servants would make  the heart of the housekeeper ache, and her anger nourish the germs of  ptomaines within her. There was little of intrinsic value to watch and  guard and worry about. There was little to make extra and difficult  work,--no glass to wash with anxious care, no elaborate silver to  clean,--only a few pieces of pewter to polish occasionally. It was all  so easy and so simple when compared with the complex and varied  paraphernalia and accompaniments of serving of meals to-day, that it was  like Arcadian simplicity.    In Virginia the table furnishings were similar to those in New England;  but there were greater contrasts in table appointments. There was more  silver, and richer food; but the negro servants were so squalid, clumsy,  and uncouth that the incongruity made the meals very surprising and, at  times, repellent.    When dinners of some state were given in the larger towns, the table was  not set or served like the formal dinner of to-day, for all the sweets,  pastry, vegetables, and meats were placed on the table together, with a  grand \"conceit\" for the ornament in the centre. At one period, when  pudding was part of the dinner, it was served first. Thus an old-time  saying is explained, which always seemed rather meaningless, \"I came  early--in pudding-time.\" There was considerable formality in portioning  out the food, especially in carving, which was regarded as much more  than a polite accomplishment, even as an art. I have seen a list of  sixty or seventy different terms in carving to be applied with exactness  to different fish, fowl, and meats. An old author says:--         \"How all must regret to hear some Persons, even of quality say,       'pray cut up that Chicken or Hen,' or 'Halve that Plover'; not       considering how indiscreetly they talk, when the proper Terms are,       'break that Goose,' 'thrust that Chicken,' 'spoil that Hen,'       'pierce that Plover.' If they are so much out in common Things, how       much more would they be with Herons, Cranes, and Peacocks.\"    It must have required good judgment and constant watchfulness never to  say \"spoil that Hen,\" when it was a chicken; or else be thought  hopelessly ill-bred.    There were few state dinners, however, served in the American colonies,  even in the large cities; there were few dinners, even, of many courses;  not always were there many dishes. There were still seen in many homes  more primitive forms of serving and eating meals, than were indicated by  the lack of individual drinking-cups, the mutual use of a trencher, or  even the utilization of the table top as a plate. In some homes an  abundant dish, such as a vast bowl of suppawn and milk, a pumpkin stewed  whole in its shell, or a savory and mammoth hotchpot was set, often  smoking hot, on the table-board; and from this well-filled receptacle  each hungry soul, armed with a long-handled pewter or wooden spoon,  helped himself, sometimes ladling his great spoonfuls into a trencher  or bowl, for more moderate and reserved after-consumption,--just as  frequently eating directly from the bountiful dish with a spoon that  came and went from dish to mouth without reproach, or thought of  ill-manners. The accounts of travellers in all the colonies frequently  tell of such repasts; some termed it eating in the fashion of the Dutch.  The reports of old settlers often recall the general dish; and some very  distinguished persons joined in the circle around it, and were glad to  get it. Variety was of little account, compared to quantity and quality.  A cheerful hospitality and grateful hearts filled the hollow place of  formality and elegance.    By the time that newspapers began to have advertisements in them--about  1750--we find many more articles for use at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22677"],[0,"Greece and the Allies, 1914-1922 (#11)"],[1,"against the injury which they proposed to  inflict upon the independence and integrity of Greece in defiance of  international law.    In reply, the British Government quietly informed the Hellenic  Government that the Entente Powers still hoped that Greece would come  into line with their policy, and that, as soon as Bulgaria had accepted  their offer, they would submit a concrete proposal dealing in detail  with {43} the surrender of Cavalla and defining precisely the Asiatic  concessions which Greece would receive in exchange.[20]    This brings the relations of the Entente Powers with M. Gounaris's  Government to an end.  It is a strange record.  We have, to begin with,  the curious reception of his first offer--the whole Greek Army, the  intervention of which might have turned the Gallipoli tragedy into a  victory.  Doubtless, there were reasons for declining so considerable a  reinforcement.  We know that, although Russia had modified her  objection to Greek participation, she still regarded the presence of a  large Greek force in European Turkey with disfavour; that the  dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire was not agreeable to France; that  the Allies could not at that time afford the military contingents  stipulated by the Greek General Staff.  There will be no disposition to  underrate the complexities of the situation, or want of sympathy for  those upon whom fell the task of finding a solution satisfactory to all  the Powers concerned.  But, though these complexities might be good  reasons for not accepting the Gounaris offer, they were hardly reasons  for not acknowledging it, even in the interest of ordinary courtesy.    Then came the sterile pourparlers through Paris.  Here, again,  political difficulties explain without justifying the attitude of the  Entente Powers.  Their refusal of the guarantee demanded by Greece as  an essential condition of her entry into the war was, of course, a  natural result of their Bulgarian policy--a policy for which very  little could be said.  Time perhaps was, at the beginning of the War,  when Bulgaria might have been won; for it is not necessary to adopt the  Graeco-Servian view that she had from the first decided to join the  enemies of the Entente and that no amount of reasonable concessions  would have satisfied her ambition; the Bulgars are a practical people,  and there was at Sofia a pro-Entente party which might have prevailed,  if the Entente Powers had, without delay, defined the proposed  concessions and proceeded to press Greece and Servia to make them--to  expect from either {44} State a voluntary self-mutilation was to expect  a miracle.  By not doing so, by shilly-shallying at Athens, Nish, and  Sofia, they only lost the confidence of Greeks and Serbs without  gaining the confidence of the Bulgars, who could hardly take seriously  proposals so vague in their formulation and so uncertain of their  fulfilment.  If, on the other hand, the Allies were unable to define  the concessions or afraid to shock public opinion by forcing them upon  Greece and Servia, then they ought to have dropped their hopeless  scheme, without wasting valuable time, and worked on the lines of  Graeco-Servian co-operation against Bulgaria.  Instead, they squashed,  as we saw, every attempt which the Greek General Staff made to that end.    But it is not the only aberration with which history will charge our  statesmen and diplomats.    Greece was going through an internal crisis; and those who know Greece  will know what that means.  In private life no people is more  temperate, more moderate, than the Greek: a sense of measure always  seasons its pleasures, and even the warmest passions of the heart seem  to obey the cool reflections of the brain.  In public life, by way of  compensation, the opposite qualities prevail; and as citizens the  Greeks display an astonishing lack of the very virtues which  distinguish them as men.  The spirit of party burns so hot in them that  it needs but a breath to kindle a conflagration.  That spirit, whose  excesses had, several times in the past, brought the fundamental  principles of the Constitution into question, and the country itself to  the brink of ruin, was once again at work.  Former friends had become  deadly enemies: the community was rent with dissensions and poisoned  with suspicions.  Preposterous falsehoods were freely scattered and  readily snatched at on both sides: the side of M. Venizelos and the  side of M. Gounaris.  Politicians who had been eclipsed by the Cretan's  brilliance, came forth now to regain their lustre at his expense.  For  like all men who have played leading parts on the world's stage, M.  Venizelos had gathered about him as much animosity as admiration; and  hate is more enterprising than love.    M. Venizelos and his partisans were at least as resourceful as their  opponents.  The Cretan had never been able to bear contradiction.  If  his greatness had created him {45} many enemies, his pettiness had  created him more.  His tone of prophetic and impeccable omniscience was  vexatious at all times, but particularly galling at this agitated  period.  It was now his constant cry that the situation called for the  work of a statesman and not of an international lawyer or strategist.  There were times when he declaimed this thesis in so violent a fashion  that no self-respecting man could work with him.  He had lost all the  able collaborators of the great Reconstruction era, and nothing could  make him forgive these \"apostates.\"  Everybody who could not see eye to  eye with him was to M. Venizelos a traitor.  It was impossible for M.  Venizelos to admit that others besides himself might be actuated by  patriotic as well as by personal motives; that he did not possess an  exclusive patent of sincerity any more than of vanity.  He found it  easier to believe that the alpha and the omega of their policy was to  undo him.  He would undo them--even at the cost of the cause he had at  heart: to see Greece openly on the side of the Entente.  It is not that  he thought less of the cause, but he thought more of himself.  His  egoism was of that heroic stature which shrinks from nothing.  His  nature impelled him to this labour; his privileged position as the  particular friend of the Entente supplied him with the means.    M. Venizelos had taken a long stride towards that end when he  insinuated that King Constantine's disagreement with him was due to  German influence.  Henceforth this calumny became the cardinal article  of his creed, and the \"Court Clique\" a society for the promotion of the  Kaiser's interests abroad and the adoption of the Kaiser's methods of  government at home.  M. Streit, though no longer a member of the  Cabinet, was represented as its mainspring: a secret counsellor who  wielded the power, while he avoided the title, of Minister; M.  Gounaris, though in name a Prime Minister, was in reality a mere  instrument of the sovereign's personal policy--so were the members of  the General Staff--so was, in fact, everyone who held opinions at  variance with his own: they all were creatures of the Crown who tried  to hide their pro-Germanism under the mask of anti-Venizelism.  Their  objections to his short-sighted and wrong-headed Asiatic  aspirations--objections the soundness of which has been amply {46}  demonstrated by experience--were dictated by regard for Germany, the  patron of Turkey.  Their offers to fight for the dissolution of  Germany's protege were not genuine: the conditions which accompanied  them were only designed to make them unacceptable.  The Entente should  beware of their bad faith and learn that M. Venizelos was the only  Greek statesman that could be trusted.[21]    The Powers who had long since adopted M. Venizelos found it convenient  to adopt all his theories.  M. Delcasse, when called upon to explain  why the Greek offer met with such scant ceremony, did so by saying that  it came from M. Gounaris, who was the instrument of the personal policy  of the sovereign, and who combated among the electors M. Venizelos, the  champion of rapprochement with the Entente; that the proposal for the  dispatch of large contingents to the East, involving as it did a  depletion of the Western Front, was calculated to please the imperial  brother-in-law of King Constantine; that the territorial guarantee  demanded by Greece would have become known to Bulgaria, thrown her into  the arms of Germany, and precipitated her against Servia, whom King  Constantine intended to leave to her fate; the trick was too gross to  deceive the Allies, and they gave it the reception it deserved.  Likewise in squashing the Greek efforts to concert with Servia measures  for mutual safety against Bulgaria, while there was yet time, the  Allies, said M. Delcasse, acted on the advice of M. Venizelos, who told  them that the Graeco-Servian Treaty was purely defensive: that it did  not provide for action unless Bulgaria attacked; and what a misfortune  if Servia, by such measures, should appear to take an initiative which  would give Bulgaria an excuse for the aggression she meditated.  Therefore, they bade Servia devote her whole attention to the security  of her Austrian frontier and not play Bulgaria's game by furnishing her  with a pretext for attack.[22]    {47}    On this side of the Channel the inventions of M. Venizelos, it would  seem, were accepted as discoveries with equal solemnity.  During the  Paris pourparlers, according to the French Ambassador in London at all  events, England was much annoyed by the Greek Government's hesitations,  which she attributed to King Constantine's opposition, and asked  herself whether she could either then or in the future treat with a  country governed autocratically.  She was persuaded that Greece lay  under the influence of Germany, and asked herself whether she could in  future support a country which let itself be guided by Powers whose  interests were"]]]
