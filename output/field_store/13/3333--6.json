The Commander of true believers is  this day bewildered amongst these mountains, and stands in need of thy  aid.'  We obeyed with joy the angelic mission, and our master, filled  with pious zeal, hath culled with his own hands these melons, oranges,  and pomegranates; he is following us with a hundred dromedaries laden  with the purest waters of his fountains, and is coming to kiss the fringe  of your consecrated robe, and implore you to enter his humble habitation,  which, placed amidst these barren wilds, resembles an emerald set in  lead.\"  The dwarfs, having ended their address, remained still standing,  and, with hands crossed upon their bosoms, preserved a respectful  silence.    Vathek in the midst of this curious harangue, seized the basket, and long  before it was finished the fruits had dissolved in his mouth; as he  continued to eat his piety increased, and in the same breath which  recited his prayers he called for the Koran and sugar.    Such was the state of his mind when the tablets, which were thrown by at  the approach of the dwarfs, again attracted his eye; he took them up, but  was ready to drop on the ground when he beheld, in large red characters,  these words inscribed by Carathis, which were indeed enough to make him  tremble:    \"Beware of thy old doctors, and their puny messengers of but one cubit  high; distrust their pious frauds, and, instead of eating their melons,  impale on a spit the bearers of them.  Shouldst thou be such a fool as to  visit them, the portal of the subterranean palace will be shut in thy  face, and with such force as shall shake thee asunder; thy body shall be  spit upon, and bats will engender in thy belly.\"    \"To what tends this ominous rhapsody?\" cries the Caliph.  \"And must I  then perish in these deserts with thirst, whilst I may refresh myself in  the valley of melons and cucumbers!  Accursed be the Giaour, with his  portal of ebony! he hath made me dance attendance too long already.  Besides, who shall prescribe laws to me?  I forsooth must not enter any  one's habitation!  Be it so; but what one can I enter that is not my  own?\"    Bababalouk, who lost not a syllable of this soliloquy, applauded it with  all his heart, and the ladies for the first time agreed with him in  opinion.    The dwarfs were entertained, caressed, and seated with great ceremony on  little cushions of satin.  The symmetry of their persons was the subject  of criticism; not an inch of them was suffered to pass unexamined;  knick-knacks and dainties were offered in profusion, but all were  declined with respectful gravity.  They clambered up the sides of the  Caliph's seat, and, placing themselves each on one of his shoulders,  began to whisper prayers in his ears; their tongues quivered like the  leaves of a poplar, and the patience of Vathek was almost exhausted, when  the acclamations of the troops announced the approach of Fakreddin, who  was come with a hundred old grey-beards and as many Korans and  dromedaries; they instantly set about their ablutions, and began to  repeat the Bismillah; Vathek, to get rid of these officious monitors,  followed their example, for his hands were burning.    The good Emir, who was punctiliously religious, and likewise a great  dealer in compliments, made an harangue five times more prolix and  insipid than his harbingers had already delivered.  The Caliph, unable  any longer to refrain, exclaimed--    \"For the love of Mahomet, my dear Fakreddin, have done! let us proceed to  your valley, and enjoy the fruits that Heaven hath vouchsafed you.\"    The hint of proceeding put all into motion; the venerable attendants of  the Emir set forward somewhat slowly, but Vathek, having ordered his  little pages in private to goad on the dromedaries, loud fits of laughter  broke forth from the cages, for the unwieldy curvetting of these poor  beasts, and the ridiculous distress of their superannuated riders,  afforded the ladies no small entertainment.    They descended, however, unhurt into the valley, by the large steps which  the Emir had cut in the rock; and already the murmuring of streams and  the rustling of leaves began to catch their attention.  The cavalcade  soon entered a path which was skirted by flowering shrubs, and extended  to a vast wood of palm-trees, whose branches overspread a building of  hewn stone.  This edifice was crowned with nine domes, and adorned with  as many portals of bronze, on which was engraven the following  inscription: \"This is the asylum of pilgrims, the refuge of travellers,  and the depository of secrets for all parts of the world.\"    Nine pages, beautiful as the day, and clothed in robes of Egyptian linen,  very long and very modest, were standing at each door.  They received the  whole retinue with an easy and inviting air.  Four of the most amiable  placed the Caliph on a magnificent taktrevan, four others, somewhat less  graceful, took charge of Bababalouk, who capered for joy at the snug  little cabin that fell to his share; the pages that remained waited on  the rest of the train.    When everything masculine was gone out of sight the gate of a large  enclosure on the right turned on its harmonious hinges and a young female  of a slender form came forth; her light brown hair floated in the hazy  breeze of the twilight; a troop of young maidens, like the Pleiades,  attended her on tip-toe.  They hastened to the pavilions that contained  the sultanas, and the young lady, gracefully bending, said to them:    \"Charming Princesses, everything is ready; we have prepared beds for your  repose, and strewed your apartments with jasmine; no insects will keep  off slumber from visiting your eyelids, we will dispel them with a  thousand plumes; come then, amiable ladies! refresh your delicate feet  and your ivory limbs in baths of rose water; and, by the light of  perfumed lamps your servants will amuse you with tales.\"    The sultanas accepted with pleasure these obliging offers, and followed  the young lady to the Emir's harem, where we must for a moment leave  them, and return to the Caliph.    Vathek found himself beneath a vast dome, illuminated by a thousand lamps  of rock crystal; as many vases of the same material, filled with  excellent sherbet, sparkled on a large table, where a profusion of viands  were spread; amongst others were sweetbreads stewed in milk of almonds,  saffron soups, and lamb _a la creme_, of all which the Caliph was  amazingly fond.  He took of each as much as he was able, testified his  sense of the Emir's friendship by the gaiety of his heart, and made the  dwarfs dance against their will, for these little devotees durst not  refuse the Commander of the Faithful; at last he spread himself on the  sofa, and slept sounder than he had ever before.    Beneath this dome a general silence prevailed, for there was nothing to  disturb it but the jaws of Bababalouk, who had untrussed himself to eat  with greater advantage, being anxious to make amends for his fast in the  mountains.  As his spirits were too high to admit of his sleeping, and  not loving to be idle, he proposed with himself to visit the harem, and  repair to his charge of the ladies, to examine if they had been properly  lubricated with the balm of Mecca, if their eyebrows and tresses were in  order, and, in a word, to perform all the little offices they might need.  He sought for a long time together, but without being able to find out  the door; he durst not speak aloud, for fear of disturbing the Caliph,  and not a soul was stirring in the precincts of the palace; he almost  despaired of effecting his purpose, when a low whispering just reached  his ear; it came from the dwarfs who were returned to their old  occupation, and for the nine hundred and ninety-ninth time in their  lives, were reading over the Koran.  They very politely invited  Bababalouk to be of their party, but his head was full of other concerns.  The dwarfs, though scandalised at his dissolute morals, directed him to  the apartments he wanted to find; his way thither lay through a hundred  dark corridors, along which he groped as he went, and at last began to  catch from the extremity of a passage the charming gossiping of the  women, which not a little delighted his heart.  \"Ah, ha! what, not yet  asleep!\" cried he; and, taking long strides as he spoke.  \"Did you not  suspect me of abjuring my charge?  I stayed but to finish what my master  had left.\"    Two of the black eunuchs, on hearing a voice so loud, detached a party in  haste, sabre in hand, to discover the cause; but presently was repeated  on all sides: \"'Tis only Bababalouk! no one but Bababalouk!\"  This  circumspect guardian, having gone up to a thin veil of carnation-coloured  silk that hung before the doorway, distinguished, by means of the  softened splendour that shone through it, an oval bath of dark porphyry,  surrounded by curtains festooned in large folds; through the apertures  between them, as they were not drawn close, groups of young slaves were  visible, amongst whom Bababalouk perceived his pupils, indulgingly  expanding their arms, as if to embrace the perfumed water and refresh  themselves after their fatigues.  The looks of tender languor, their  confidential whispers, and the enchanting smiles with which they were  imparted, the exquisite fragrance of the roses, all combined to inspire a  voluptuousness, which even Bababalouk himself was scarce able to  withstand.    He summoned up, however, his usual solemnity, and, in the peremptory tone  of authority, commanded the ladies instantly to leave the bath.  Whilst  he was issuing these mandates the young Nouronihar, daughter of the Emir,  who was sprightly as an antelope, and full of wanton gaiety, beckoned one  of her slaves to let down the great swing, which was suspended to the  ceiling by cords of silk, and whilst this was doing, winked to her  companions in the bath, who, chagrined to be forced"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20606"],[0,"The Magic City (#11)"],[1,"find Lucy in a dark hall with silver pillars.    'All the same,' he said, 'it's not so dark as it was, by long chalks.'    It was not. The silver pillars had begun to give out a faint soft glow  like the silver phosphorescence that lies in sea pools in summer time.    'It's lucky too,' he said, 'because of the holes in the floor.'    The holes were the spots on the dominoes with which the pillared hall  was paved.    'I wonder what part of the city where Lucy is I shall come out at?'  Philip asked himself. But he need not have troubled. He did not come  out at all. He walked on and on and on and on and on. He thought he was  walking straight, but really he was turning first this way and then  that, and then the other way among the avenues of silver pillars which  all looked just alike.    He was getting very tired, and he had been walking a long time, before  he came to anything that was not silver pillars and velvet black under  invisible roofs, and floor paved with dominoes laid very close together.    'Oh, I am glad!' he said at last, when he saw the pavement narrow to a  single line of dominoes just like the path he had come in by. There was  an arch too, like the arch by which he had come in. And then he  perceived in a shock of miserable surprise that it was, in fact, the  same arch and the same domino path. He had come back, after all that  walking, to the point from which he had started. It was most mortifying.  So silly! Philip sat down on the edge of the domino path to rest and  think.    'Suppose I just walk out and don't believe in magic any more?' he said  to himself. 'Helen says magic can only happen to people who believe in  magic. So if I just walked out and didn't believe as hard as ever I  could, I should be my own right size again, and Lucy would be back, and  there wouldn't _be_ any magic.'    [Illustration: He walked on and on and on.]    'Yes, but,' said that voice that always would come and join in whenever  Philip was talking to himself, 'suppose Lucy _does_ believe it? Then  it'll all go on for her, whatever _you_ believe, and she _won't_ be  back. Besides, you know you've _got_ to believe it, because it's true.'    'Oh, bother!' said Philip; 'I'm tired. I don't want to go on.'    'You shouldn't have deserted Lucy,' said the tiresome voice, 'then you  wouldn't have had to go back to look for her.'    'But I can't find my way. How can I find my way?'    'You know well enough. Fix your eyes on a far-off pillar and walk  straight to it, and when you're nearly there fix your eyes a little  farther. You're bound to come out somewhere.'    'But I'm tired and it's so lonely,' said Philip.    'Lucy's lonely too,' said the voice.    'Drop it!' said Philip. And he got up and began to walk again. Also he  took the advice of that worrying voice and fixed his eyes on a distant  pillar.    'But why should I bother?' he said; 'this is a sort of dream.'    'Even if it _were_ a dream,' said the voice, 'there are adventures in  it. So you may as well be adventurous.'    'Oh, all right,' said Philip, and on he went.    And by walking very carefully and fixing his eyes a long way off, he did  at last come right through the hall of silver pillars, and saw beyond  the faint glow of the pillars the blue light of day. It shone very  brightly through a very little door, and when Philip came to that door  he went through it without hesitation. And there he was in a big field.  It was rather like the illimitable prairie, only there were great  patches of different-coloured flowers. Also there was a path across it,  and he followed the path.    'Because,' he said, 'I'm more likely to meet Lucy. Girls always keep to  paths. They never explore.'    Which just shows how little he knew about girls.    He looked back after a while, to see what the hall of pillars looked  like from outside, but it was already dim in the mists of distance.    But ahead of him he saw a great rough building, rather like Stonehenge.    'I wish I'd come into the other city where the people are, and the  soldiers, and the greyhounds, and the cocoa-nuts,' he told himself.  'There's nobody here at all, not even Lucy.'    The loneliness of the place grew more and more unpleasing to Philip.  But he went on. It seemed more reasonable than to go back.    'I ought to be very hungry,' he said; 'I must have been walking for  hours.' But he wasn't hungry. It may have been the magic, or it may have  been the odd breakfast he had had. I don't know. He spoke aloud because  it was so quiet in that strange open country with no one in it but  himself. And no sound but the clump, clump of his boots on the path. And  it seemed to him that everything grew quieter and quieter till he could  almost hear himself think. Loneliness, real loneliness is a dreadful  thing. I hope you will never feel it. Philip looked to right and left,  and before him, and on all the wide plain nothing moved. There were the  grass and flowers, but no wind stirred them. And there was no sign that  any living person had ever trodden that path--except that there _was_ a  path to tread, and that the path led to the Stonehenge building, and  even that seemed to be only a ruin.    'I'll go as far as that anyhow,' said Philip; 'perhaps there'll be a  signboard there or something.'    There was something. Something most unexpected. Philip reached the  building; it was really very like Stonehenge, only the pillars were  taller and closer together and there was one high solid towering wall;  turned the corner of a massive upright and ran almost into the arms, and  quite on to the feet of a man in a white apron and a square paper cap,  who sat on a fallen column, eating bread and cheese with a clasp-knife.    'I beg your pardon!' Philip gasped.    'Granted, I'm sure,' said the man; 'but it's a dangerous thing to do,  Master Philip, running sheer on to chaps' clasp-knives.'    He set Philip on his feet, and waved the knife, which had been so often  sharpened that the blade was half worn away.    'Set you down and get your breath,' he said kindly.    'Why, it's _you_!' said Philip.    'Course it is. Who should I be if I wasn't me? That's poetry.'    'But how did you get here?'    'Ah!' said the man going on with his bread and cheese, while he talked  quite in the friendliest way, 'that's telling.'    'Well, tell then,' said Philip impatiently. But he sat down.    'Well, you say it's me. Who be it? Give it a name.'    'You're old Perrin,' said Pip; 'I mean, of course, I beg your pardon,  you're Mr. Perrin, the carpenter.'    'And what does carpenters do?'    'Carp, I suppose,' said Philip. 'That means they make things, doesn't  it?'    'That's it,' said the man encouragingly; 'what sort of things now might  old Perrin have made for you?'    'You made my wheelbarrow, I know,' said Philip, 'and my bricks.'    'Ah!' said Mr. Perrin, 'now you've got it. I made your bricks, seasoned  oak, and true to the thousandth of an inch, they was. And that's how I  got here. So now you know.'    'But what are you doing here?' said Philip, wriggling restlessly on the  fallen column.    'Waiting for you. Them as knows sent me out to meet you, and give you a  hint of what's expected of you.'    'Well. What _is_?' said Philip. 'I mean I think it's very kind of you.  What _is_ expected?'    'Plenty of time,' said the carpenter, 'plenty. Nothing ain't expected of  you till towards sundown.'    'I do think it was most awfully kind of you,' said Philip, who had now  thought this over.    'You was kind to old Perrin once,' said that person.    'Was I?' said Philip, much surprised.    'Yes; when my little girl was ailing you brought her a lot of pears off  your own tree. Not one of 'em you didn't 'ave yourself that year, Miss  Helen told me. And you brought back our kitten--the sandy and white one  with black spots--when it strayed. So I was quite willing to come and  meet you when so told. And knowing something of young gentlemen's  peckers, owing to being in business once next door to a boys' school, I  made so bold as to bring you a snack.'    He reached a hand down behind the fallen pillar on which they sat and  brought up a basket.    'Here,' he said. And Philip, raising the lid, was delighted to find that  he was hungry. It was a pleasant basketful. Meat pasties, red hairy  gooseberries, a stone bottle of ginger-beer, a blue mug with Philip on  it in gold letters, a slice of soda cake and two farthing sugar-sticks.    'I'm sure I've seen that basket before,' said the boy as he ate.    'Like enough. It's the one you brought them pears down in.'    'Now look here,' said Philip, through his seventh bite of pasty, 'you  _must_ tell me how you got here. And tell me where you've got to. You've  simply no idea how muddling it all is to me. Do tell me _everything_.  Where are we, I mean, and why? And what I've got to do. And why? And  when? Tell me every single thing.' And he took the eighth bite.    'You really don't know, sir?'    'No,' said Philip, contemplating the ninth or last bite but one. It was  a large pasty.    'Well then. Here goes. But I was always a poor speaker, and so  considered even by friends at cricket dinners and what not.'    'But I don't want you to speak,' said Philip; 'just tell me.'    'Well, then. How did I get here? I got here through having made them  bricks what you built this tumble-down old ancient place with.'    '_I_ built?'    'Yes, with them bricks I made you. I understand as this was the first  building you ever put up. That's why it's first on the road to where you  want to get to!'    Philip looked round at the Stonehenge building and saw that it was  indeed built of enormous oak bricks.    'Of course,' he said, 'only I've grown smaller.'    'Or they've grown bigger,' said Mr. Perrin; 'it's the same thing. You  see it's like this. All the cities and things you ever built is in this  country. I don't know how it's managed, no more'n what you do. But so it  is. And as you made 'em, "]]]
