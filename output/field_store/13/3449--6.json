There were, nevertheless, several  instances of courageous defence: large numbers were successfully  resisted by a single musket; and it was stated by Governor Arthur, that  two armed men would strike a whole mob with panic--a contempt of their  valour, which was often provoked by the subtlety of their escape. Such  is commonly the case: savages, even when courageous, are unwilling to  face the deadly weapon of the white man. They, however, lost much of  their alarm; and, at length, would pause for the report, and rush on  with shouts of defiance, when the English had discharged their guns.    The most courageous instances of defence, were furnished by females:  they were sometimes surprised by a visit, when escape was hopeless, and  relief unattainable. Mrs. Maclanachan maintained a post, purely by her  resolution. Mrs. Dalrymple Brigge, a half-caste woman, was rewarded  with twenty acres of land, for her heroism. She drew inside her house  her wounded child, barricaded her door, and fired through a crevice. The  blacks attempted, first to pull down her cottage, and then to destroy it  by fire. The conflict lasted more than an hour, when relief came.  Another: Mrs. Connel defended her house with the musket; a little child,  of four years, bringing one to her as she fired off another: she was  within a few days of her confinement. The fortitude displayed, on these  occasions, was very justly admired: we cannot, however, but be sensible,  that few possessed either the physical strength, or the knowledge of  arms, equal to a task so hard.    In this colony, 1830 will be ever memorable, as the year of the Black  War--that campaign, which formed the first military lesson given to the  colonists. In the ferment of the public mind, innumerable plans were  propounded for their capture: some merit remembrance from their oddity,  and some for their kindness. It was suggested, that those natives in  custody should be driven forward, secured by a tether, and thus  compelled to guide the pursuit. It was also proposed, that depots of  flour, sugar, and other tempting articles of food should be placed in  the tracks, and when natives were engaged in seizing the prize, the  Philistines would be upon them. A third plan recommended, that four or  five persons should be placed in the vicinity of huts, to be erected for  the purpose: they were to stand outside, and allure the natives; and  when seen by them, to feign alarm, and run. The natives, it was  expected, would make for the seemingly abandoned dwellings, to be  surprised by the English, lying in ambush. Their dogs often gave them  notice of approach: a scheme was propounded, to turn this advantage  against them. The English were to be furnished with two sets of dogs:  one leash, swift and fierce, to pursue the dogs of the natives; but as  both would soon vanish from the sight of the pursuers, the second  species were to be retained, to scent their course. Thus, the native  would run first,--his dogs after him; then would come the large dogs of  the English--then their little dogs; and, finally, the captors! An old  mariner, who had witnessed the effect of music in taming savage tribes,  proposed to try the persuasion of sweet sounds. He was not aware, that  the expedient had been in vain tested under happier auspices; even had  it been possible for a military band to career along with the requisite  speed. The musician of the _Recherche_ carried his instrument on shore,  and played his sweetest melodies: the natives took no notice. Unwilling  to doubt the efficacy of his art, on his next visit he used sharper  tones and quicker measures: the aborigines put their fingers to their  ears, and the Frenchman dropped his fiddle in despair.    It will be proper briefly to notice the state of the public mind at the  moment. The natives were now a mere handful: an irregular contest of  several years duration, now and then slackened, was ever adding some new  victim to the slain. The constables occasionally fell in with the  temporary huts, which told the mournful tale of rapid depopulation. In  tracks, where thirty or forty huts had, in former years, indicated a  considerable clan, four or five only were reared; but while the natives  diminished, they seemed to increase their activity, moving to various  places with almost incredible swiftness. It is said, that they would  travel fifty miles in a day. Their superior knowledge of the country  enabled them to reach stations more remote in appearance than reality. A  colonist, of the present time, by better acquaintance with the road, can  pass in a few hours to places, once several days journey distant. Such  rapid progress may perhaps be doubted, but it was sufficient to give  them the appearance of ubiquity; and since they now were no longer  casual but habitual robbers, the havoc and alarm they created had rather  augmented, as their numbers declined. The colony, then prosperous in its  general affairs, was deeply depressed by their continued outrages:  shepherds would no longer tend their flocks, unless accompanied by armed  companions. On the slightest signal of the approaching foe, they would  flee with precipitation: ten times a day the quiet of domestic life  would be broken by the fears, feigned or real, of the workmen. If they  idled on the road, it was the blacks that retarded them: if they lost  provisions, the hut had been robbed by the blacks. Often, too, these  vexations were tinged with the ludicrous: the rumour would reach the  township that an unfortunate had been speared, who, when more closely  examined, was found dead drunk. Some imaginative settler would return,  with the sure information that the blacks were lurking in the woods: the  cautious whites, well armed and skilfully disposed, would march round  the hiding place, and stealthily approach a stump of more than usual  likeness to animated nature.    An officer, newly arrived, when the depredations were most alarming and  frequent, looked from the window of his cottage, in the twilight, and  discerned many blacks crouching among the stubble of a corn field  lately reaped. He hastened and ordered out his men: they cautiously  crept round the inclosure, and were gratified as they drew nigh to  discover that the enemy had not moved. Another small party of soldiers  observed a body of fifty or sixty, on the borders of a creek, flowing  into Oyster Bay: as they were approached by the British, they made for a  point of land. It was, apparently, a certain capture: the soldiers and  constables rushed on, when the foe took the water. In these adversaries  the colonist will recognise the black stumps, left by imperfect farming,  and the black swans which adorn our waters. Notice was brought, that  some one in the far interior was killed: the coroner's jury was  summoned; the verdict was, of necessity, \"_not yet dead_.\"[16]    The disquietude occasioned by an enemy, so insignificant; the constant  vigilance imposed, and the not infrequent heavy calamities inflicted,  are events justly exhibited by the _Aborigines' Committee_, as a lesson  to mankind. The long oppression of a race, not prone to violence, was  now productive of its fruit, and exacted from the colonists a fearful  retribution.    The most alarming movement of the natives was, the systematic  destruction of premises by fire. This was revenge within their reach, at  any hour; and its previous infrequency is a matter of astonishment. In  three months, the huts of Messrs. Howel, Sherwin, and Clarke, had been  destroyed. The property of Mr. Sherwin, lying between hills, was easily  watched, and spies were posted on the heights. The mode of firing the  premises was deliberate: they kindled the flames at twenty yards apart,  so that the whole was simultaneously burned; this done, they went off,  shouting and crying out to the English to go away. The extent of the  mischief was not so alarming as its forebodings. That element, which  nature has placed at man's disposal, and can be turned, by a moment's  effort to the destruction of a fortune, might long have proved an  effectual scourge, and made colonisation hopeless. The retention of  properties, as well as the security of dependents, required decided and  unanimous measures.    No part of Governor Arthur's character conciliates greater esteem, than  his promptitude to encourage humanity in the whites, and to win the  confidence of the natives. At the commencement of this year, he offered  a liberal reward to any one who should open a pacific communication, or  if a convict free pardon. He promised five pounds for every adult, and  two pounds for every child, taken alive. He entreated the colonists to  enjoin the utmost tenderness on their servants, and invariably to spare  the women and children. These merciful intentions were but little  successful: the rewards were rarely claimed. But no effort, in a right  direction, is ever lost: the conduct of John Benfield, a convict, was  distinguished for intrepidity and coolness in a capture, and Colonel  Arthur bestowed warm praise. Observing a fire, at a short distance, he  approached three aborigines, to whom he offered bread: one of them  promised to accompany him, if he would put aside his gun; this risk he  incurred. He led the black to his hut, and gave him food and blankets  for his companions; and soon succeeded in completely conciliating them  all. They joined him in hunting the opossum: thus he drew them on to the  military party stationed at Captain Moriarty's. This man certainly  deserved the reward he obtained, and the government notice of an action  so courageous and humane, must have mitigated the fierce spirit of his  class.    The orders and notices issued by the Governor during this year,  represent the powerful agitation of the public mind, and from which he  himself was by no means free. Sometimes, the hope of reconciliation  seemed strong; thus, August 19th, he states that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22885"],[0,"Hindu Gods And Heroes (#11)"],[1,"plainly artificial concoctions.]    This theory really is not by any means as wild as at first sight it  may seem to be. Divine saints are sometimes mentioned in the Rig-veda  and Brahmanas as being the creators of the universe[22]; and they  appear again and again in legend as equals of the gods, attaining  divine powers by their mystic insight into the sacrificial lore. But  there is more direct evidence than this.    [Footnote 22: RV. X. cxxix. 5, SB. VI. i. 1, 1-5. Cf. Charpentier,  _Suparnasage_, p. 387.]    In the Mahabharata there are incorporated two documents of first-rate  importance for the doctrines of the churches that worshipped Vishnu.  One of these is the Bhagavad-gita, or Lord's Song (VI. xxv.-xlii.);  the other is the Narayaniya, or Account of Narayana (XII.  cccxxxvi.-cccliii.). Their teachings are not the same in details,  though on most main points they agree; for they belong to different  sections of the one religious body. Leaving aside the Bhagavad-gita  for the moment, we note that the Narayaniya relates a story that there  were born four sons of Dharma, or Righteousness, viz. Nara, Narayana,  Hari or Vishnu, and Krishna. In other places (I. ccxxx. 18, III. xii.  45, xlvii. 10, V. xlviii. 15, etc.) we are plainly told that Nara is a  previous incarnation of Arjuna the Pandava prince, and Narayana is, of  course, the supreme Deity, who in the time of Arjuna was born on earth  as Krishna Vasudeva, and that in his earlier birth Nara and Narayana  were both ascetic saints. This tradition is very important, for it  enables us to see something of the early character of Narayana. He was  an ancient saint of legend, who was connected with a hero Nara, just  as Krishna was associated with Arjuna; and the atmosphere of  saintliness clings to him obstinately. Tradition alleges that he was  the _rishi_, or inspired seer, who composed the Purusha-sukta of the  Rig-veda (X. 90), and represents him by choice as lying in a  _yoga-nidra_, or mystic sleep, upon the body of the giant serpent  Sesha in the midst of the Ocean of Milk. Thus the worship of Vishnu,  like the worship of Siva, has owed much to the influence of live yogis  idealised as divine saints; though it must be admitted that the yogis  of the Vaishnava orders have usually been more agreeable and less  ambiguous than those of the Saiva community.    We must briefly consider now the religious teachings of the  Bhagavad-gita and the Narayaniya, and then turn to the inscriptions  and contemporary literature to see whether we can find any sidelights  in them. We begin with the Bhagavad-gita, or The Lord's Song.    The Bhagavad-gita purports to be a dialogue between the Pandava prince  Arjuna and Krishna, who was serving him as his charioteer, on the eve  of the great battle. In order to invent a leading motive for his  teaching, the poet represents Arjuna as suddenly stricken with  overwhelming remorse at the prospect of the fratricidal strife which  he is about to begin. \"I will not fight,\" he cries in anguish. Then  Krishna begins a long series of arguments to stimulate him for the  coming battle. He points out, with quotations from the Upanishads,  that killing men in battle does not destroy their souls; for the soul  is indestructible, migrating from body to body according to its own  deserts. The duty of the man born in the Warrior-caste is to fight;  fighting is his caste-duty, his _dharma_, and as such it can entail  upon him no guilt if it be performed in the right spirit. But how is  this to be done? The answer is the leading motive of Krishna's  teaching. For the maintenance of the world it is necessary that men  should do the works of their respective castes, and these works do not  operate as _karma_ to the detriment of the future life of their souls  if they perform them not from selfish motives but as offerings made in  perfect unselfishness to the Lord. This is the doctrine of  _Karma-yoga_, discipline of works, which is declared to lead the soul  of the worshipper to salvation in the Lord as effectually as the  ancient intellectualism preached in the Upanishads and the Samkhya  philosophy. But there is also a third way to salvation, the way  through loving devotion, or _bhakti_, which is as efficacious as  either of the other two; the worshippers of Siva had already preached  this for their own church in the Svetasvatara Upanishad. Besides  treating without much consistency or method of many incidental  questions of religious theory and practice, Krishna reveals himself  for a few instants to Arjuna in his form as Viraj, the universal being  in which all beings are comprehended and consumed. Finally Arjuna is  comforted, and laying the burden of all his works upon Krishna, he  prepares in quiet faith for the coming day of battle.    There are four main points to notice in this teaching. (1) The Supreme  God, superior to Brahma, he who rules by grace and comprehends in his  universal person the whole of existence, is Vishnu, or Hari,  represented on earth for the time being by Krishna Vasudeva. The  author makes no attempt to reconcile the fatalism implied in the old  theory of _karma-samsara_ with his new doctrine of special and general  grace: he allows the two principles to stand side by side, and leaves  for future generations of theologians the delicate task of harmonising  them. (2) Three roads to salvation are recognised in principle, the  intellectual gnosis of the old Upanishads and the Samkhya, the \"way of  works\" or performance of necessary social duties in a spirit of  perfect surrender to God, and the \"way of devotion,\" continuous loving  worship and contemplation of God. In practice the first method is  ignored as being too severe for average men; the second and third are  recommended, as being suitable for all classes. (3) The way of  salvation is thus thrown open directly to men and women of all castes  and conditions. The Bhagavad-gita fully approves of the orthodox  division of society into castes; but by its doctrine that the  performance of caste-duties in a spirit of sacrifice leads to  salvation it makes caste an avenue to salvation, not a barrier. (4)  The Bhagavad-gita has nothing to say for the animal-sacrifices of the  Brahmans. It recognises only offerings of flowers, fruits, and the  like. The doctrine of _ahimsa_, \"thou shalt do no hurt,\" was making  much headway at the time, and the wholesale animal-sacrifices of the  Brahmans roused general disgust, of which the Buddhists and Jains  took advantage for the propagation of their teachings.    I have previously spoken of the solitary passage in the Chhandogya  Upanishad in which Krishna's name is mentioned, as receiving the  teachings of Ghora Angirasa, and it will now be fitting to see how far  these teachings are reflected in the Bhagavad-gita. Ghora compares the  functions of life to the ceremonies of the _diksha_ (see above, p.68):  and this is at bottom the same idea as the doctrine of _karma-yoga_  preached again and again in the Bhagavad-gita. \"Whatever be thy work,  thine eating, thy sacrifice, thy gift, thy mortification, make of it  an offering to me,\" says Krishna (IX. 27); all life should be regarded  as a sacrifice freely offered. Then Ghora continues: \"In the hour of  death one should take refuge in these three thoughts: 'Thou art the  Indestructible, Thou art the Unfailing, Thou art instinct with  Spirit.' On this there are these two verses of the Rig-veda:        Thus upward from the primal seed      From out the darkness all around      We, looking on the higher light,      Yea, looking on the higher heaven,      Have come to Surya, god midst gods,      To him that is the highest light, the highest light.\"    In the Bhagavad-gita (IV. 1 ff.) Krishna announces that he preached  his doctrine to Vivasvan the Sun-god, who passed it on to his son the  patriarch Manu; elsewhere in the Mahabharata (XII. cccv. 19) the  Satvata teaching is said to have been announced by the Sun. Ghora in  his list of moral virtues enumerates \"mortification, charity,  uprightness, harmlessness, truthfulness\"; exactly the same attributes,  with a few more, are said in the Bhagavad-gita to characterise the man  who is born to the gods' estate (XVI. 1-3). Ghora's exhortation to  think of the nature of the Supreme in the hour of death is balanced by  Krishna's words: \"He who at his last hour, when he casts off the body,  goes hence remembering me, goes assuredly into my being\" (VIII. 5; cf.  10). These parallels are indeed not very close; but collectively they  are significant, and when we bear in mind that the author of the  Bhagavad-gita is eager to associate his doctrine with those of the  Upanishads, and thus to make it a new and catholic Upanishad for all  classes, we are led to conclude that its fundamental ideas,  sanctification of works (_karma-yoga_), worship of a Supreme God of  Grace (_bhakti_) by all classes, and rejection of animal sacrifices  (_ahimsa_) arose among the orthodox Kshatriyas, who found means to  persuade their Brahmanic preceptors to bring it into connection with  their Upanishads and embellish it with appropriate texts from those  sources. Very likely Krishna Vasudeva, if not the first inventor of  these doctrines, was their most vigorous propagator.    Now what are the teachings of the Narayaniya? It appears to contain  two accounts. In the first we have the story of king Vasu Uparichara,  who is said to have worshipped the Supreme God Hari (Vishnu) in  devotion without any animal-sacrifices, in accordance with doctrines  ascribed to the Aranyakas, i.e. the later sections of the Brahmanas,  including the older Upanishads. This fully agrees with the standpoint  of the Bhagavad-gita. The second account gives the story of a visit  paid by the divine saint Narada to a mysterious \"White Island,\"  Sveta-dvipa, inhabited by holy worshippers of God who are, strangely  enough, described as having heads shaped like umbrellas and feet like"]]]
