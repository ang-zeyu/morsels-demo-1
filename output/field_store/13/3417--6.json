A worker might have been ever so faithful  in the discharge of his duties, but if the administration was changed,  he ran the risk of losing his position without any notice.    Statesmen of both great political parties had long seen the injustice of  the spoils system, but few cared to take the matter up for fear of  offending their political friends. But as matters grew worse, those who  were honest said they would stand such a system no longer, and they  began to advocate the merit plan, whereby each worker for our  government should stand on his merit, so that he could not be removed  from his position without just cause. This merit system is in operation  to-day and is a most excellent thing, only becoming dangerous when  extended too far.    There were two other commissioners besides Mr. Roosevelt on the  Commission, but all worked together in harmony, although in many moves  taken Mr. Roosevelt was the leader. About this work he has written a  notable essay called \"Six Years of Civil Service Reform,\" in which he  reviews much of the work done. In this essay, among many other things,  he says:--    \"No republic can permanently endure when its politics are corrupt and  base; and the spoils system,--the application in political life of the  degrading doctrine that to the victor belong the spoils,--produces  corruption and degradation. The man who is in politics for the offices  might just as well be in politics for the money he can get for his vote,  so far as the general good is concerned.\" Certainly wise words and well  worth remembering.    The work of the Commission was by no means easy, and the members were  often accused of doing some things merely to benefit their own  particular party or friends. Politicians of the old sort, who wanted  everything they could lay hands on, fought civil service bitterly, and  even those who might have been expected to help often held back, fearing  they would lose their own popularity. Yet on the other hand, some  members of Congress upheld the Commission nobly, and when President  Garfield was assassinated by a half-crazy office-seeker many more came  forward and clamored to put public offices on the merit system by all  means.    Part of the work of the Commission was to prosecute the head of any  bureau or department where an employee had been discharged or had  suffered without just cause. Such cases came up in large numbers and  were prosecuted with all the vigor of which the Commission were capable.    \"We were not always successful in these trials,\" says Mr. Roosevelt.  \"But we won out in the majority of cases, and we gave the wrong-doing  such a wide publicity that those who were guilty hesitated to repeat  their actions.\" And he goes on to add that during his term of service  not over one per cent. of those who worked for Uncle Sam were dismissed  purely for political reasons. This was certainly an excellent record,  and our government will do well to maintain such a high standard in the  future.    To give a further idea of the work required in the way of examinations  for positions under our government, let me state that during the year  from July 1, 1890, to July 1, 1891, 5251 applicants were examined for  the departments service, 1579 for the customs service, 8538 for the  postal service, 3706 for the railway mail service, making a total of  nearly 20,000, of which about 13,000 passed and the balance failed.  Since our war with Spain, the work of the government has been vastly  increased, and the places to be filled every year run up into figures  that are startling.    One of the best and wisest acts of the Commission was to place the  colored employees of the government on an equal footing with the white  employees. In the past the colored employees had occupied their places  merely through the whim or goodwill of those over them. Now this was  changed, and any colored man who could pass the examination, and who was  willing to attend strictly to his labor, was as safe in his situation as  anybody.          CHAPTER IX    A TRIP TO THE SHOSHONE MOUNTAINS--CAUGHT IN A DRIVING SNOWSTORM--BACK TO  WORK--RESIGNATION AS CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSIONER      Notwithstanding the great amount of labor involved as a Civil Service  Commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt did not forego the pleasures of the  hunt, and in 1891 he made an extended trip to the Shoshone Mountains in  Wyoming, going after elk and such other game as might present itself.    On this trip he was accompanied by his ranch partner, a skilled shot  named Ferguson, and two old hunters named Woody and Hofer. There was  also in the party a young fellow who looked after the pack-horses,  fourteen in number.    The start was made on a beautiful day in September, and the party  journeyed along at a gait that pleased them, bringing down everything  that came to hand and which could be used as meat. Two tents were  carried, one for sheltering their packs at night and the other for  sleeping purposes.    In his book called \"The Wilderness Hunter,\" Mr. Roosevelt has given many  of the details of this grand hunt, which he says was one of the most  exciting as well as most pleasurable undertaken. With an interest that  cannot be mistaken, and which betrays the true sportsman at every turn,  he gives minute descriptions of how the tents were erected, how  everything in camp was put in its proper place, and how on wet days they  would huddle around the camp-fire in the middle of the larger tent to  keep warm and dry. He also tells how the packs on the horses were  adjusted, and adds that the hunter who cannot take care of his outfit  while on the hunt, or who must have all his game stalked for him, is a  hunter in name only;--which is literally true, as every genuine  sportsman knows.    The young Civil Service Commissioner went out garbed in a fitting  hunting costume, consisting of a buckskin shirt, with stout leggings,  and moccasins, or, when occasion required, alligator-leather boots.  Heavy overcoats were also carried and plenty of blankets, and for extra  cold nights Theodore Roosevelt had a fur sleeping-bag, in which, no  doubt, he slept \"as snug as a bug in a rug.\"    The horses of a pack-train in the wild West are not always thoroughly  broken, and although the majority rarely do anything worse than lag  behind or stray away, yet occasionally one or another will indulge in  antics far from desired. This was true on the present occasion, when at  different times the pack-beasts went on a \"shindy\" that upset all  calculations and scattered packs far and wide, causing a general alarm  and hard work on the part of all hands to restore quietness and order.    For two days the hunters pushed on into the mountains with but little  signs of game. Then a rain-storm set in which made the outlook a dismal  one.    \"Going to have a big storm,\" said one of the old hunters.    \"Never mind, we'll have to take it as it comes,\" was Mr. Roosevelt's  philosophical answer. \"We can't expect good weather every day.\"    It was almost noon of that day when all heard the call of a bull elk,  echoing over the hills. The sound came from no great distance, and in  the face of the rain, Theodore Roosevelt and the hunter named Woody set  off on foot after the beast, who was still calling as loudly as ever.    It was not long before the hunters could hear the bull plainly, as he  pawed the earth, a challenge to another bull who was answering him from  a great distance.    \"We are gettin' closer to him,\" said Woody. \"Got to go slow now, or  he'll take alarm and be off like a flash.\"    The timber was rather thin, and the ground was covered with moss and  fallen leaves, and over this the pair glided as silently as shadows,  until Woody declared that the bull was not over a hundred yards away.    \"And he's in a tearing rage, on account of that other bull,\" he added.  \"Got to plug him fair and square or there will be trouble.\"    Without replying to this, Theodore Roosevelt took the lead, keeping eyes  and ears wide open for anything that might come to hand. Then through  the trees he caught sight of the stately horns of the elk, as he stood  with head thrown back, repeating his call in trumpet-like tones.    As the hunters came closer, the elk faced around and caught sight of his  human enemies. Up went his antlers once more, as if to defy them.    \"He's coming!\" shouted Woody. And scarcely had he spoken when Theodore  Roosevelt took aim and fired at the animal. There was a snort and a  gasp, and the elk turned to run away. Then Roosevelt fired a second  shot, and over went the monarch of the forest in his death agony. It was  a fine bit of game to bring down, the antlers having twelve prongs. The  head was cut off and taken back to camp, along with a small part of the  best of the meat.    After that the forward march was resumed in the face of a sweeping rain  that wet everybody to the skin. On they went until, just as the rain  ceased, they reached a bold plateau, overlooking what is called  Two-Ocean Pass, a wild and wonderful freak of nature, surrounded by  lofty mountains and watered by streams and brooks flowing in several  directions. Far up the mountains could be seen the snow-drifts, while  lower down were the heavy forests and underbrush, the haunts of the game  they were seeking.    In this Wonderland Theodore Roosevelt hunted to his heart's content for  many days--bringing down several more elk and also a fair variety of  smaller game. It was now growing colder, and knowing that the winter  season was close at hand, the hunters decided to strike camp and return  homeward.    The movement was made none too soon. The snow was already filling the  air, and one morning, on coming from his tent, Theodore Roosevelt found  the ground covered to a depth of a foot and a half. To add to his  discomfort the pony he was riding began to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22373"],[0,"Russian Fairy Tales: A Choice Collection of Muscovite Folk-lore (#11)"],[1,"money.\"      They divided it equally between them: each of the shares    was a large one.      \"But how about the copeck?\" asks the poor man.      \"Ah, brother!\" replies Marko, \"surely you can see I've got    no change!\"      And so Marko the Rich never paid the copeck after all.    We may take next the large class of stories about simpletons, so dear  to the public in all parts of the world. In the Skazkas a simpleton is  known as a _durak_, a word which admits of a variety of explanations.  Sometimes it means an idiot, sometimes a fool in the sense of a  jester. In the stories of village life its signification is generally  that of a \"ninny;\" in the \"fairy stories\" it is frequently applied to  the youngest of the well-known \"Three Brothers,\" the \"Boots\" of the  family as Dr. Dasent has called him. In the latter case, of course,  the hero's _durachestvo_, or foolishness, is purely subjective. It  exists only in the false conceptions of his character which his family  or his neighbors have formed.[61] But the _durak_ of the following  tale is represented as being really \"daft.\" The story begins with one  of the conventional openings of the Skazka--\"In a certain _tsarstvo_,  in a certain _gosudarstvo_,\"--but the two synonyms for \"kingdom\" or  \"state\" are used only because they rhyme.        THE FOOL AND THE BIRCH-TREE.[62]      In a certain country there once lived an old man who had three    sons. Two of them had their wits about them, but the third was    a fool. The old man died and his sons divided his property    among themselves by lot. The sharp-witted ones got plenty of    all sorts of good things, but nothing fell to the share of the Simpleton    but one ox--and that such a skinny one!      Well, fair-time came round, and the clever brothers got ready    to go and transact business. The Simpleton saw this, and said:      \"I'll go, too, brothers, and take my ox for sale.\"      So he fastened a cord to the horn of the ox and drove it to    the town. On his way he happened to pass through a forest, and    in the forest there stood an old withered Birch-tree. Whenever    the wind blew the Birch-tree creaked.      \"What is the Birch creaking about?\" thinks the Simpleton.    \"Surely it must be bargaining for my ox? Well,\" says he, \"if    you want to buy it, why buy it. I'm not against selling it. The    price of the ox is twenty roubles. I can't take less. Out with    the money!\"      The Birch made no reply, only went on creaking. But the    Simpleton fancied that it was asking for the ox on credit. \"Very    good,\" says he, \"I'll wait till to-morrow!\" He tied the ox to the    Birch, took leave of the tree, and went home. Presently in came    the clever brothers, and began questioning him:      \"Well, Simpleton! sold your ox?\"      \"I've sold it.\"      \"For how much?\"      \"For twenty roubles.\"      \"Where's the money?\"      \"I haven't received the money yet. It was settled I should    go for it to-morrow.\"      \"There's simplicity for you!\" say they.      Early next morning the Simpleton got up, dressed himself,    and went to the Birch-tree for his money. He reached the wood;    there stood the Birch, waving in the wind, but the ox was not to    be seen. During the night the wolves had eaten it.      \"Now, then, neighbor!\" he exclaimed, \"pay me my money.    You promised you'd pay me to-day.\"      The wind blew, the Birch creaked, and the Simpleton cried:      \"What a liar you are! Yesterday you kept saying, 'I'll pay    you to-morrow,' and now you make just the same promise.    Well, so be it, I'll wait one day more, but not a bit longer. I want    the money myself.\"      When he returned home, his brothers again questioned him    closely:      \"Have you got your money?\"      \"No, brothers; I've got to wait for my money again.\"      \"Whom have you sold it to?\"      \"To the withered Birch-tree in the forest.\"      \"Oh, what an idiot!\"      On the third day the Simpleton took his hatchet and went to    the forest. Arriving there, he demanded his money; but the    Birch-tree only creaked and creaked. \"No, no, neighbor!\"    says he. \"If you're always going to treat me to promises,[63]    there'll be no getting anything out of you. I don't like such    joking; I'll pay you out well for it!\"      With that he pitched into it with his hatchet, so that its chips    flew about in all directions. Now, in that Birch-tree there was    a hollow, and in that hollow some robbers had hidden a pot full    of gold. The tree split asunder, and the Simpleton caught sight    of the gold. He took as much of it as the skirts of his caftan    would hold, and toiled home with it. There he showed his    brothers what he had brought.      \"Where did you get such a lot, Simpleton?\" said they.      \"A neighbor gave it me for my ox. But this isn't anything    like the whole of it; a good half of it I didn't bring home with    me! Come along, brothers, let's get the rest!\"      Well, they went into the forest, secured the money, and carried    it home.      \"Now mind, Simpleton,\" say the sensible brothers, \"don't    tell anyone that we've such a lot of gold.\"      \"Never fear, I won't tell a soul!\"      All of a sudden they run up against a Diachok,[64] and says    he:--      \"What's that, brothers, you're bringing from the forest?\"      The sharp ones replied, \"Mushrooms.\" But the Simpleton    contradicted them, saying:      \"They're telling lies! we're carrying money; here, just take    a look at it.\"      The Diachok uttered such an \"Oh!\"--then he flung himself    on the gold, and began seizing handfuls of it and stuffing them    into his pocket. The Simpleton grew angry, dealt him a blow    with his hatchet, and struck him dead.      \"Heigh, Simpleton! what have you been and done!\" cried    his brothers. \"You're a lost man, and you'll be the cause of our    destruction, too! Wherever shall we put the dead body?\"      They thought and thought, and at last they dragged it to an    empty cellar and flung it in there. But later on in the evening    the eldest brother said to the second one:--      \"This piece of work is sure to turn out badly. When they    begin looking for the Diachok, you'll see that Simpleton will tell    them everything. Let's kill a goat and bury it in the cellar, and    hide the body of the dead man in some other place.\"      Well, they waited till the dead of night; then they killed a    goat and flung it into the cellar, but they carried the Diachok to    another place and there hid him in the ground. Several days    passed, and then people began looking everywhere for the Diachok,    asking everyone about him.      \"What do you want him for?\" said the Simpleton, when he    was asked. \"I killed him some time ago with my hatchet, and    my brothers carried him into the cellar.\"      Straightway they laid hands on the Simpleton, crying, \"Take    us there and show him to us.\"      The Simpleton went down into the cellar, got hold of the    goat's head, and asked:--      \"Was your Diachok dark-haired?\"      \"He was.\"      \"And had he a beard?\"      \"Yes, he'd a beard.\"      \"And horns?\"      \"What horns are you talking about, Simpleton?\"      \"Well, see for yourselves,\" said he, tossing up the head to    them. They looked, saw it was a goat's, spat in the Simpleton's    face, and went their ways home.    One of the most popular simpleton-tales in the world is that of the  fond parents who harrow their feelings by conjuring up the misfortunes  which may possibly await their as yet unborn grandchildren. In  Scotland it is told, in a slightly different form, of two old maids  who were once found bathed in tears, and who were obliged to confess  that they had been day-dreaming and supposing--if they had been  married, and one had had a boy and the other a girl; and if the  children, when they grew up, had married, and had had a little child;  and if it had tumbled out of the window and been killed--what a  dreadful thing it would have been. At which terrible idea they both  gave way to not unnatural tears. In one of its Russian forms, it is  told of the old parents of a boy named Lutonya, who weep over the  hypothetical death of an imaginary grandchild, thinking how sad it  would have been if a log which the old woman has dropped had killed  that as yet merely potential infant. The parent's grief appears to  Lutonya so uncalled for that he leaves home, declaring that he will  not return until he has found people more foolish than they. He  travels long and far, and witnesses several foolish doings, most of  which are familiar to us. In one place, a cow is being hoisted on to a  roof in order that it may eat the grass growing thereon; in another a  horse is being inserted into its collar by sheer force; in a third, a  woman is fetching milk from the cellar, a spoonful at a time. But the  story comes to an end before its hero has discovered the surpassing  stupidity of which he is in quest. In another Russian story of a  similar nature Lutonya goes from home in search of some one more  foolish than his mother, who has been tricked by a cunning sharper.  First he finds carpenters attempting to stretch a beam which is not  long enough, and earns their gratitude by showing them how to add a  piece to it. Then he comes to a place where sickles are unknown, and  harvesters are in the habit of biting off the ears of corn, so he  makes a sickle for them, thrusts it into a sheaf and leaves it there.  They take it for a monstrous worm, tie a cord to it, and drag it away  to the bank of the river. There they fasten one of their number to a  log and set him afloat, giving him the end of the cord, in order that  he may drag the \"worm\" after him into the water. The log turns over,  and the moujik with it, so that his head is under water while his legs  appear above it. \"Why, brother!\" they call to him from the bank, \"why  are you so particular about your leggings? If they do get wet, you can  dry them at the fire.\" But he makes"]]]
