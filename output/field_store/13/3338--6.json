His own father had been in the first party of adventurous  pioneers who had traveled up from the south to cross over the Reno Pass  of the Mazatzals into the Basin.  \"Newcomers from outside get  impressions of the Tonto accordin' to the first settlers they meet,\"  declared Blaisdell.  \"An' shore it's my belief these first impressions  never change, just so strong they are!  Wal, I've heard my father say  there were men in his wagon train that got run out of Texas, but he  swore he wasn't one of them.  So I reckon that sort of talk held good  for twenty years, an' for all the Texans who emigrated, except, of  course, such notorious rustlers as Daggs an' men of his ilk.  Shore  we've got some bad men heah.  There's no law.  Possession used to mean  more than it does now.  Daggs an' his Hash Knife Gang have begun to  hold forth with a high hand.  No small rancher can keep enough stock to  pay for his labor.\"    At the time of which Blaisdell spoke there were not many sheepmen and  cattlemen in the Tonto, considering its vast area.  But these, on  account of the extreme wildness of the broken country, were limited to  the comparatively open Grass Valley and its adjacent environs.  Naturally, as the inhabitants increased and stock raising grew in  proportion the grazing and water rights became matters of extreme  importance.  Sheepmen ran their flocks up on the Rim in summer time and  down into the Basin in winter time.  A sheepman could throw a few  thousand sheep round a cattleman's ranch and ruin him.  The range was  free.  It was as fair for sheepmen to graze their herds anywhere as it  was for cattlemen.  This of course did not apply to the few acres of  cultivated ground that a rancher could call his own; but very few  cattle could have been raised on such limited area.  Blaisdell said  that the sheepmen were unfair because they could have done just as  well, though perhaps at more labor, by keeping to the ridges and  leaving the open valley and little flats to the ranchers.  Formerly  there had been room enough for all; now the grazing ranges were being  encroached upon by sheepmen newly come to the Tonto.  To Blaisdell's  way of thinking the rustler menace was more serious than the  sheeping-off of the range, for the simple reason that no cattleman knew  exactly who the rustlers were and for the more complex and significant  reason that the rustlers did not steal sheep.    \"Texas was overstocked with bad men an' fine steers,\" concluded  Blaisdell.  \"Most of the first an' some of the last have struck the  Tonto.  The sheepmen have now got distributin' points for wool an'  sheep at Maricopa an' Phoenix.  They're shore waxin' strong an' bold.\"    \"Ahuh! ... An' what's likely to come of this mess?\" queried Jean.    \"Ask your dad,\" replied Blaisdell.    \"I will.  But I reckon I'd be obliged for your opinion.\"    \"Wal, short an' sweet it's this: Texas cattlemen will never allow the  range they stocked to be overrun by sheepmen.\"    \"Who's this man Greaves?\" went on Jean.  \"Never run into anyone like  him.\"    \"Greaves is hard to figure.  He's a snaky customer in deals.  But he  seems to be good to the poor people 'round heah.  Says he's from  Missouri.  Ha-ha!  He's as much Texan as I am.  He rode into the Tonto  without even a pack to his name.  An' presently he builds his stone  house an' freights supplies in from Phoenix.  Appears to buy an' sell a  good deal of stock.  For a while it looked like he was steerin' a  middle course between cattlemen an' sheepmen.  Both sides made a  rendezvous of his store, where he heard the grievances of each. Laterly  he's leanin' to the sheepmen.  Nobody has accused him of that yet.  But  it's time some cattleman called his bluff.\"    \"Of course there are honest an' square sheepmen in the Basin?\" queried  Jean.    \"Yes, an' some of them are not unreasonable.  But the new fellows that  dropped in on us the last few year--they're the ones we're goin' to  clash with.\"    \"This--sheepman, Jorth?\" went on Jean, in slow hesitation, as if  compelled to ask what he would rather not learn.    \"Jorth must be the leader of this sheep faction that's harryin' us  ranchers.  He doesn't make threats or roar around like some of them.  But he goes on raisin' an' buyin' more an' more sheep.  An' his herders  have been grazin' down all around us this winter.  Jorth's got to be  reckoned with.\"    \"Who is he?\"    \"Wal, I don't know enough to talk aboot.  Your dad never said so, but I  think he an' Jorth knew each other in Texas years ago.  I never saw  Jorth but once.  That was in Greaves's barroom.  Your dad an' Jorth met  that day for the first time in this country.  Wal, I've not known men  for nothin'.  They just stood stiff an' looked at each other. Your dad  was aboot to draw.  But Jorth made no sign to throw a gun.\"    Jean saw the growing and weaving and thickening threads of a tangle  that had already involved him.  And the sudden pang of regret he  sustained was not wholly because of sympathies with his own people.    \"The other day back up in the woods on the Rim I ran into a sheepman  who said his name was Colter.  Who is he?    \"Colter?  Shore he's a new one.  What'd he look like?\"    Jean described Colter with a readiness that spoke volumes for the  vividness of his impressions.    \"I don't know him,\" replied Blaisdell.  \"But that only goes to prove my  contention--any fellow runnin' wild in the woods can say he's a  sheepman.\"    \"Colter surprised me by callin' me by my name,\" continued Jean. \"Our  little talk wasn't exactly friendly.  He said a lot about my bein' sent  for to run sheep herders out of the country.\"    \"Shore that's all over,\" replied Blaisdell, seriously.  \"You're a  marked man already.\"    \"What started such rumor?\"    \"Shore you cain't prove it by me.  But it's not taken as rumor. It's  got to the sheepmen as hard as bullets.\"    \"Ahuh!  That accunts for Colter's seemin' a little sore under the  collar.  Well, he said they were goin' to run sheep over Grass Valley,  an' for me to take that hunch to my dad.\"    Blaisdell had his chair tilted back and his heavy boots against a post  of the porch.  Down he thumped.  His neck corded with a sudden rush of  blood and his eyes changed to blue fire.    \"The hell he did!\" he ejaculated, in furious amaze.    Jean gauged the brooding, rankling hurt of this old cattleman by his  sudden break from the cool, easy Texan manner.  Blaisdell cursed under  his breath, swung his arms violently, as if to throw a last doubt or  hope aside, and then relapsed to his former state.  He laid a brown  hand on Jean's knee.    \"Two years ago I called the cards,\" he said, quietly.  \"It means a  Grass Valley war.\"    Not until late that afternoon did Jean's father broach the subject  uppermost in his mind.  Then at an opportune moment he drew Jean away  into the cedars out of sight.    \"Son, I shore hate to make your home-comin' unhappy,\" he said, with  evidence of agitation, \"but so help me God I have to do it!\"    \"Dad, you called me Prodigal, an' I reckon you were right.  I've  shirked my duty to you.  I'm ready now to make up for it,\" replied  Jean, feelingly.    \"Wal, wal, shore thats fine-spoken, my boy.... Let's set down heah an'  have a long talk.  First off, what did Jim Blaisdell tell you?\"    Briefly Jean outlined the neighbor rancher's conversation.  Then Jean  recounted his experience with Colter and concluded with Blaisdell's  reception of the sheepman's threat.  If Jean expected to see his father  rise up like a lion in his wrath he made a huge mistake.  This news of  Colter and his talk never struck even a spark from Gaston Isbel.    \"Wal,\" he began, thoughtfully, \"reckon there are only two points in  Jim's talk I need touch on.  There's shore goin' to be a Grass Valley  war.  An' Jim's idea of the cause of it seems to be pretty much the  same as that of all the other cattlemen.  It 'll go down a black blot  on the history page of the Tonto Basin as a war between rival sheepmen  an' cattlemen.  Same old fight over water an' grass! ... Jean, my son,  that is wrong.  It 'll not be a war between sheepmen an' cattlemen. But  a war of honest ranchers against rustlers maskin' as sheep-raisers! ...  Mind you, I don't belittle the trouble between sheepmen an' cattlemen  in Arizona.  It's real an' it's vital an' it's serious. It 'll take law  an' order to straighten out the grazin' question. Some day the  government will keep sheep off of cattle ranges.... So get things right  in your mind, my son.  You can trust your dad to tell the absolute  truth.  In this fight that 'll wipe out some of the Isbels--maybe all  of them--you're on the side of justice an' right. Knowin' that, a man  can fight a hundred times harder than he who knows he is a liar an' a  thief.\"    The old rancher wiped his perspiring face and breathed slowly and  deeply.  Jean sensed in him the rise of a tremendous emotional strain.  Wonderingly he watched the keen lined face.  More than material worries  were at the root of brooding, mounting thoughts in his father's eyes.    \"Now next take what Jim said aboot your comin' to chase these  sheep-herders out of the valley.... Jean, I started that talk. I had my  tricky reasons.  I know these greaser sheep-herders an' I know the  respect Texans have for a gunman.  Some say I bragged. Some say I'm an  old fool in his dotage, ravin' aboot a favorite son. But they are  people who hate me an' are afraid.  True, son, I talked with a purpose,  but shore I was mighty cold an' steady when I did it. My feelin' was  that you'd do what I'd do if I were thirty years younger. No, I  reckoned you'd do more.  For I figured on your blood.  Jean, you're  Indian, an' Texas an' French, an' you've trained yourself in the Oregon  woods.  When you were only a boy, few marksmen I ever knew could beat  you, an' I never saw your equal for eye an' ear, for trackin' a hoss,  for all the gifts that make a woodsman....

Most of the coast-land is subject  to the Sultan of Turkey, but the people in the interior are practically  independent. They are a wild and warlike pastoral people, called  Beduins. Only certain parts of the country are inhabited, the rest being  occupied by terrible deserts and wastes, where even now no European has  set his foot.    Near the coast of the Red Sea are two Arab towns which are as holy and  full of memories to Mohammedans all over the world as Jerusalem and Rome  to Christians. At Mecca the prophet Mohammed was born in the year  A.D. 570, and at Medina he died and was buried in 632. He was  the founder of the Mohammedan religion, and his doctrine, Islamism,  which he proclaimed to the Arabs, has since spread over so many  countries in the Old World that its adherents now number 217 millions.    To all the followers of Islam a pilgrimage to Mecca is a most desirable  undertaking. Whoever has once been there may die in peace, and in his  lifetime he may attach the honourable title of Hajji to his name. From  distant countries in Africa and from the innermost parts of Asia  innumerable pilgrims flock annually to the holy towns.    Adjoining Arabia on the north-east lies the country called Mesopotamia,  through which flow the rivers Euphrates and Tigris. An English steamer  carried me from Bushire up the turbid waters of the Tigris, and from the  deck I could see copper-brown, half-naked Arabs riding barebacked on  handsome horses. They feed their flocks of sheep on the steppe, holding  long lances in their hands. Sometimes the steamer is invaded by a cloud  of green grasshoppers, and one can only escape them by going into one's  cabin and closing both door and windows. Round the funnel lie heaps of  grasshoppers who have singed themselves or are stupefied by the smoke.    After a voyage of a few days up the river I come to Baghdad, which  retains little of its former magnificence. In the eleventh century  Baghdad was the greatest city of the Mohammedans, and here were  collected the Indian and Arabic tales which are called the _Thousand and  one Nights_. Not far from Baghdad, but on the Euphrates, lay in early  ages the great and brilliant Babylon, which had a hundred gates of  brass. By the waters of Babylon the Jewish captives hung up their harps  on the willows, and of Babylon Jeremiah prophesied: \"And Babylon shall  become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an  hissing, without an inhabitant.\"      BAGHDAD TO TEHERAN    When I reached Baghdad I had only a little over L5 left, all in Persian  silver _kran_, a _kran_ being worth about seven-pence; and I could not  get any more money until I reached Teheran, 600 miles away. I knew that  if I could only get as far as the town of Kermanshah, a distance of 200  miles, I could then take service in a caravan; but it would be  unpleasant to tramp on foot the whole way, and receive no pay other than  a little bread and a few cucumbers and melons.    Just in the nick of time, however, I made the acquaintance of a caravan  owner who was starting immediately for Kermanshah with English  merchandise. The goods were loaded on fifty asses, and were accompanied  by ten Arab traders on horseback. Eight pilgrims and a Chaldean merchant  had joined the party. I, too, might go with them on paying fifty _kran_  for the hire of a mule; food and drink I must provide for myself.    It was a pleasant journey which began at ten o'clock on the evening of  June 6. Two Arabs led me on my mule slowly and solemnly through the  narrow streets of Baghdad in the warm summer night. An oil lamp  flickered dully here and there, but the bazaars were brisk and lively.  Here sat thousands of Arabs, talking, eating, drinking, and smoking. It  was the month of fasting, when nothing is eaten until after sunset.    The two Arabs conducted me into the court of a caravanserai, where the  traders were just making preparations to start. When I heard that they  would not be ready before two o'clock in the morning, I lay down on a  heap of bales and slept like a top.    Two o'clock came much sooner than I wished. An Arab came and shook me,  and, half asleep, I mounted my mule. To the shouts of the drivers, the  tinkle of the small bells, and the ding-dong of the large camel-bells  the long caravan passed out into the darkness. Soon we had the outermost  courts and palm groves of Baghdad behind us, and before us the silent,  sleeping desert.    No one troubled himself about me; I had paid for the mule and might look  after myself. Sometimes I rode in front, sometimes behind, and  occasionally I almost went to sleep in the saddle. The body of a dead  dromedary lay on the road, and a pack of hungry jackals and hyaenas were  feasting on the carcase. When we came near them they ran away  noiselessly to the desert, only to return when we were past. Farther on  some fat vultures kept watch round the body of a horse, and raised  themselves on their heavy wings as we approached.    [Illustration: PLATE IV. A PERSIAN CARAVANSERAI.]    After a ride of seven hours we reached a caravanserai, where the Arabs  unloaded their animals and said that we were to stay there all day. It  was as warm as in an oven, and there was nothing to do but lie and doze  on the stone floor.    Next night we rode eight hours to the town of Bakuba, which is  surrounded by a wood of fine date-palms. Here we encamped in the court  of a huge caravanserai (Plate IV.). I was sitting talking to one of my  travelling companions when three Turkish soldiers came and demanded to  see my passport. \"I have no passport,\" I replied. \"Well, then, pay us  ten _kran_ apiece, and you shall pass the frontier all the same.\" \"No, I  will not pay you a farthing,\" was the answer they got. \"Take that rug  and the bag instead,\" they cried, and made for my things. This I could  not stand, and gave the man who seized my bag such a blow on the chest  that he dropped his booty, and the same with the man with the rug. The  scoundrels were making to rush at me together, when two of my Arabs came  up to my assistance. To avoid further unpleasantness I went to the  governor, who for six _kran_ gave me a passport.    I had now become so friendly with the Arabs that I obtained the loan of  a horse instead of a mule. We set out again at nine o'clock, and rode  all night in the most brilliant moonshine. I was so sleepy that  sometimes I dozed in the saddle, and once, when the horse shied at a  skeleton on the road, I was roused up and fell off, while the horse ran  off over the steppe. After much trouble one of the caravan men caught  him again, and I slept no more that night.    As usual we stayed over the day at the next village. I was tired of  travelling in this fashion, moving so slowly and seeing so little of the  country. When, then, an old Arab belonging to the caravan came riding up  from Baghdad on a fine Arab horse, I determined to try to get away from  my party with his assistance. He consented to accompany me if I paid him  twenty-five _kran_ a day. At first we kept near the caravan, but as  soon as the moon had set we increased our pace, and when the sound of  the bells grew faint behind us we trotted off quickly through the night.    We arrived safely at Kermanshah on June 13. After paying the old Arab I  had only sixpence left! I could not engage a room or buy anything to  eat, and the prospect of going begging among Mohammedans was certainly  not attractive. Fortunately I had heard of a rich Arab merchant, Agha  Hassan, who lived in this town, and I directed my steps to his handsome  house. In my dusty riding-boots, and whip in hand, I passed through many  fine rooms until at last I found myself in the presence of Agha Hassan,  who was sitting with his secretary in the midst of books and papers. He  wore a white silk mantle embroidered with gold, a turban on his head and  spectacles on his nose, and looked both friendly and dignified.    \"How are you, sir?\" he asked. \"Very well, thank you,\" I responded.  \"Where have you come from?\" \"From Baghdad.\" \"And where are you going?\"  \"To Teheran.\" \"Are you an Englishman?\" \"No, I am a Swede.\" \"Swede? What  is that?\" \"Well, I come from a country called Sweden.\" \"Whereabouts does  it lie?\" \"Far away to the north-west, beyond Russia.\" \"Ah, wait, I know!  You are no doubt from Ironhead's country?\" \"Yes, I am from the country  of Charles XII.\" \"I am very glad to hear it; I have read of Charles the  Twelfth's remarkable exploits; you must tell me about him. And you must  tell me about Sweden, its king and army, and about your own home,  whether your parents are still living, and if you have any sisters. But  first you must promise to stay as my guest for six months. All that I  have is yours. You have only to command.\" \"Sir, I am very thankful for  your kindness, but I cannot avail myself of your hospitality for more  than three days.\" \"You surely mean three weeks?\" \"No, you are too good,  but I must go back to Teheran.\" \"That is very tiresome, but, however,  you can think it over.\"    A servant conducted me to an adjoining building, which was to be mine  during my stay, and where I made myself at home in a large apartment  with Persian rugs and black silk divans. Two secretaries were placed at  my disposal, and servants to carry out my slightest wish. If I desired  to eat, they would bring in a piece of excellent mutton on a spit, a  chicken boiled with rice, sour milk, cheese and bread, apricots, grapes,  and melons, and at the end of the meal coffee and a water-pipe; if I  wished to drink, a sweet liquor of iced date-juice was served; and if I  thought of taking a ride in order to see the town and neighbourhood,  pure-blooded Arab horses stood in the"]]]
