Knowing that the girls would not do any damage, the mistresses allowed  them to disperse, on the understanding that they came at once when they  heard the Guide's whistle.    Dulcie, Carmel, and Prissie had wandered away down the banks of the  little stream where grew pale marsh violets, golden globeflowers, and  the sweet-scented fern. Pushing through the undergrowth above the water,  they found themselves in a tiny natural clearing such as poets of old  would have described as a \"a bower.\" Budding trees encircled it, a  guelder rose bush overtopped it, and delicate fern-like moss sprang  through the grass underfoot. There were fairies, too, in the bower; four  little whitethroats were flitting about in the sunshine. It was perhaps  their first exodus from the nest, for as yet they were without the  slightest sense of fear. They allowed the girls to catch them, fondle  them, and stroke their lovely plumage; they would fly delicately away,  twittering with pleasure, then flit back to the caressing hands like  sprites at play. Anything more innocent and beautiful it would have been  impossible to conceive; it was like a glimpse into Paradise before the  fear and dread of man had passed over God's lesser creatures. The girls  stood absolutely fascinated, till at last, attracted perhaps by some  warning mother-signal, their dainty bird friends took a sudden rapid  flight into the woods and were gone. Carmel looked after them with  shining eyes.    \"It's like St. Francis of Assissi and his 'little sisters the birds,'\"  she said softly. \"Have you read the _Little Flowers of St. Francis_, and  how he preached to the swallows and they all flocked round him and  twittered? I've never seen birds so tame as this! They aren't in Sicily,  you can hardly ever get near them there.\"    \"They aren't in England either,\" said Dulcie, \"though our gamekeeper  told us that if you can just chance to see them when they first leave  the nest, they don't know what fear is. He once found some newly-hatched  wild ducks, and they were perfectly unafraid, but when he passed the  place half an hour later, the mother duck gave a call, and the little  ones wouldn't let him come anywhere near them. They'd had their lesson,  and learnt fear.\"    \"I once brought up a starling that had tumbled out of a nest,\" said  Prissie, \"and it was always perfectly tame, and would let me stroke it,  and would perch on my hand. I had it for years. Do you think we could  have kept the whitethroats?\"    \"No, no!\" said Carmel quickly. \"I'd as soon think of caging fairies! It  would be a shame to take them out of this lovely wood; it's their  fairy-land. I'm so glad Sir Ranald doesn't allow boys to come in here! I  thought at first it was rather selfish of him, but I begin to  understand. There must be some quiet places left where the birds can be  undisturbed. I'm glad to have seen these!\"    Miss Walter's whistle, sounding loudly in the distance, recalled them  to the path. They found the school very excited over a heronry which  they could see on an island in the lake. Some large untidy nests were in  the trees, and every now and then a heron, with long legs outstretched  behind it, would sail majestically through the air from the mainland.    \"It would be a very fishy place if we could get near,\" remarked Miss  Hardy. \"All the ground underneath the nests would be strewn with bones  and remains. The herons fly a tremendous long way in search of food,  sometimes a radius of as much as forty miles. Look! there's one fishing  in the lake over there.\"    \"I like the whitethroats best,\" said Dulcie. \"I shouldn't care to hold a  young heron in my hand and cuddle it!\"    At the lower end of the lake was a hill-side, and down the slopes Sir  Ranald had caused to be planted a little forest of rhododendrons. They  were in their prime, and stretched a beautiful mass of every shade from  crimson to pink and lavender. On the top of the hill was a summer-house,  a temple-like building with pillars and steps, and here, by arrangement,  they expected the lodge-keeper's wife to supply them with boiling water  for their tea. It looked an ideal place for a picnic, and they started  at once to climb the steep path that led among the rhododendrons to the  summit. Up and up under the screen of delicate blossom, they felt as if  they were treading in some tropical garden, and when they reached the  summit, and the view burst upon them of crimson-clad slope, gleaming  lake, and flecked blue sky, they stood gazing with much satisfaction.  \"The Temple,\" as the girls called the summer-house, was a classic  building with a terrace in front, and here the school elected to sit,  instead of in the rather cramped room. There was a kitchen at the back,  and Mrs. Bates, the lodge-keeper's wife, had lighted a fire and boiled  kettles in readiness for them.    \"Sir Ranald and his friends come for lunch here sometimes in the  shooting season,\" she explained, \"so I'm used to getting tea and coffee  made. Take some chairs outside if you like. You'd rather sit on the  steps! Well, there's no accounting for tastes! Give me your teapots, and  I'll warm them before you put the tea into them.\"    Sitting in a row on the steps that led from the \"temple\" to the terrace,  the girls had a glorious view, Carmel in especial seemed particularly to  enjoy herself.    \"It's more like home than anything I've seen yet!\" she declared  enthusiastically. \"I could almost fancy that this little piazza is on  the slope of Etna! The goatherds ought to be playing the 'Pastorale'  down there! I can nearly hear them!\"    \"What's the 'Pastorale'?\" asked Dulcie.    \"It's the Sicilian National Dance. Every body dances it--sometimes by  sunlight and sometimes by moonlight. Oh! it's a thing that gets into  your blood! Once you hear it played on the pipes you have to jump up and  dance--you simply can't help it. There's magic in it!\"    \"Dance it for us now on the terrace!\" suggested Dulcie.    \"I've no music!\"    \"Can't you hum it? Miss Walters, may Carmel show us a Sicilian dance?\"    \"By all means, if she will!\" acquiesced the head-mistress.    \"Go on Carmel!\" commanded the girls. \"Show us how it goes!\"    Thus urged, Carmel rose from her seat, and went on to the terrace at the  foot of the steps. She looked for a moment or two at the crimson slope  of flowers and the shining lake, as if to put herself into the right  mental atmosphere, then, humming a lively but haunting tune, she began  her old-world southern dance.    It was wonderful dancing, every action of her alert young body was so  beautifully graceful that you forgot her modern costume and could  imagine her a nymph in classic draperies. Her arms kept motion with her  tripping feet, and both were in time with the tune that she was  trilling. It seemed a spontaneous expression of gaiety as natural as the  flight of a dragon-fly or the sporting of a kitten. Her dark hair flew  out behind her, her eyes shone and sparkled, and her cheeks flushed with  unwonted color. For the moment she looked the very incarnation of joy,  and might have been Artemis surprised in a Sicilian grove. It was such a  fresh aspect of Carmel that the girls stared at her in amazement. From  Princess she had changed to Oread, and they did not know her in this new  mood. They gave her performance a hearty clap, however, as she stopped  and sank panting on to the steps.    \"You'll have to turn dancing-mistress, Carmel, and give the others a  lesson in your Pastorale,\" said Miss Walters. \"It's a pretty step, and  we shall ask you to do it again when we give our garden fete in aid of  the 'Waifs and Strays.' Don't you think our English scenery can compare  favorably even with your beloved Sicily?\"    \"It's very beautiful,\" admitted Carmel, \"but I miss Etna in the  distance.\"    \"Then you won't yield us the palm?\" laughed Miss Walters.    \"I love it all, I do indeed, but Sicily will always be the most  beautiful place in the world to me, because it's home!\"          CHAPTER VII    An Old Greek Idyll      After the picnic at Bradstone, Carmel, possibly from something she heard  the girls say about her, seemed to make a supreme effort to overcome her  homesickness, and to settle down as an ordinary and rational member of  the school. She was undoubtedly a favorite. Even Lilias admitted her  charm, though she had not fallen under her spell so completely as  Dulcie. At the bottom of her heart, Lilias could not quite forgive  Carmel for supplanting her brother at the Chase. From the night he had  said good-by and motored to Balderton, not a word had been heard of  Everard. He had not returned to school, neither had he visited any  relations or friends, and indeed since he stepped out of the car at the  railway station all trace of him seemed to have vanished. Mr. Bowden did  not take the matter too seriously. He considered Everard was more of a  man now than a schoolboy, and that, if he had fulfilled his threat of  running away to sea, the brief experience of a voyage before the mast  would do him no harm, and that when the vessel returned to port he  would probably be only too glad to come back and claim his share of the  inheritance.    This easy view annoyed Lilias. She had a share of the Ingleton pride,  and she would have liked his absence treated with more concern. She  thought Mr. Bowden ought to advertise in the Agony Column of _The  Times_, beseeching Everard to return home, but their guardian only  laughed when she suggested such a course, and assured her that her  brother would turn up in time when he was tired of managing for himself.    \"I've been in the law for thirty years, my dear, and I know human nature  better than you do,\" he declared indulgently.    \"But you don't know Everard as I do!\" protested Lilias.    She could not take Mr. Bowden's view of the case. Everard had left the  Chase in such deep anger and resentment that the chances of a speedy  change in his outlook"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#11)"],[1,"laughter, but rather the fierce, harsh, vehement laughter of the  Hebrew Psalms, the laughter of scorn, the shooting out of the lips, the  saying \"Ha, ha.\" He speaks with his mouth, and swords are in his lips.  Thus, of Alexander Morus, Professor of Sacred History at Amsterdam, whom  he suspected to be the author of a tract in support of Salmasius, he  says: \"There is one More, part Frenchman and part Scot, so that one  country or one people cannot be quite overwhelmed with the whole infamy  of his extraction\"; and he indulges himself in a debauch of punning on  _Morus_, the Latin word for a mulberry. In the prelatical controversy,  after discussing with his opponent the meaning of the word \"angel,\" he  continues: \"It is not ordination nor jurisdiction that is angelical, but  the heavenly message of the Gospel, which is the office of all ministers  alike.... And if you will contend still for a superiority in one person,  you must ground it better than from this metaphor, which you may now  deplore as the axe-head that fell into the water, and say, 'Alas, master!  for it was borrowed'; unless you have as good a faculty to make iron  swim, as you had to make light froth sink.\" In the _Apology_ for  Smectymnuus he heaps one grotesque comparison on another. His adversary,  the son of Bishop Hall, is like \"some empiric of false accusations to try  his poisons upon me, whether they would work or not.\" The learning that  was displayed by the champion of Episcopacy and the very typographical  arrangement of his book incur an equal contempt: the margin of his  treatise \"is the sluice most commonly that feeds the drought of his  text.... Nor yet content with the wonted room of his margin, but he must  cut out large docks and creeks into his text, to unlade the foolish  frigate of his unseasonable authorities.\" His best folios \"are  predestined to no better end than to make winding-sheets in Lent for  pilchers.\" With this last stroke Milton is so well pleased that he  repeats the same prediction in an elaborated form over the works of  Salmasius, and even celebrates in numerous verse the forethought and  bounty of one who has thus taken pity on the nakedness of fishes.    The fantastic nature of these quips and taunts reminds us that Milton  belonged to the age of the metaphysical poets and satirists, the age of  Cowley, and Cleveland, and Butler. His prose works have been searched  chiefly for passages that may be used to illustrate his poetry; and  although the search has been rewarded with many natural coincidences of  expression, not a few passages of lofty self-confidence, and some  raptures of poetic metaphor, the result has been in the main a  disappointment. His admirers, too jealous for the poetic dignity of their  hero, have turned away sorrowfully from this memorial heap of odd-shaped  missiles, hurled from his dire left hand for the confusion of his  enemies. And yet, rightly judged, there is instruction, and an increased  reverence for the poet, to be found in these also--in all that wild array  of subjects and methods which he commands for the purposes of his prose,  but dismisses from the service of his verse. It was a strict and rare  selection that he made among the auxiliaries when he addressed himself to  the more arduous attempt. Here and there, even in _Paradise Lost_, his  education in the handling of satire and invective stood him in stead. The  poem contains more than one \"flyting\"--to use the Scottish term--and the  high war of words between Satan and Abdiel in heaven, or between Satan  and Gabriel on earth, could not have been handled save by a master of all  the weapons of verbal fence and all the devices of wounding invective. In  the great close of the Fourth Book, especially, where the arch-fiend and  the archangel retaliate defiance, and tower, in swift alternate flights,  to higher and higher pitches of exultant scorn, Milton puts forth all his  strength, and brings into action a whole armoury of sarcasm and insult  whetted and polished from its earlier prosaic exercise. Even the  grotesque element in his humour is not wholly excluded from the _Paradise  Lost_; it has full scope, for once, in the episodical description of the  Paradise of Fools--that barren continent, beaten on by the storms of  chaos, dark save for some faint glimmerings from the wall of heaven, the  inhabitants a disordered and depraved multitude of philosophers,  crusaders, monks, and friars, blown like leaves into the air by the winds  that sweep those desert tracts. Unlike the Paradise that was lost, this  paradise is wholly of Milton's invention, and is the best extant monument  to that spirit of mockery and savage triumph which is all the humour that  he knows.    The style of his prose works is a style formed upon oratorical models.  The long winding sentence, propped on epithets and festooned with  digressions, was the habitual vehicle of his meaning. The effect it  produces at its best was well described by Marvell, who, in a letter to  Milton thanking him for a copy of the _Defence of the People of England_,  remarks: \"When I consider how equally it turns and rises with so many  figures, it seems to me a Trajan's column, in whose winding ascent we see  embossed the several monuments of your learned victories.\" The clink of  the rhyming couplet was not more displeasing to Milton's ear than the  continued emphatic bark of a series of short sentences. Accustomed as he  was to the heavy-armed processional manner of scholarly Renaissance  prose, he felt it an indignity to \"lie at the mercy of a coy, flirting  style; to be girded with frumps and curtal jibes, by one who makes  sentences by the statute, as if all above three inches long were  confiscate.\" Later on in the _Apology_ he returns to this grievance, and  describes how his adversary \"sobs me out half a dozen phthisical mottoes,  wherever he had them, hopping short in the measure of convulsion fits; in  which labour the agony of his wit having escaped narrowly, instead of  well-sized periods, he greets us with a quantity of thumb-ring posies.\"  The men of the Renaissance despised the homely savour of the native  English syntax with its rude rhetoric and abrupt logic and its lore of  popular adages and maxims; they had learned to taste a subtler pleasure  in the progressive undulations of a long mobile sentence, rising and  falling alternately, reaching the limit of its height towards the middle,  and at the close either dying away or breaking in a sudden crash of  unexpected downward emphasis. This is the sentence preferred by Milton,  and, where haste or zeal does not interfere with the leisurely ordering,  handled by him with excellent skill. At its best and at its worst alike  his prose is the prose of a poet. His sentences rarely conform to any  strict periodic model; each idea, as it occurs to him, brings with it a  train of variation and enrichment, which, by the time the sentence  closes, is often found in sole possession. The architecture depends on  melody rather than on logic. The emphasis and burden of the thought  generally hangs on the epithets, descriptive terms, and phrases, which he  strengthens by arranging them in pairs, after a fashion much practised by  poets. Thus, to take a few examples from the Divorce pamphlets, a wife,  who should be \"an intimate and speaking help,\" \"a ready and reviving  associate,\" to comfort \"the misinformed and wearied life of man\" with \"a  sweet and gladsome society,\" is too often \"a mute and spiritless mate,\"  united to her husband in \"a disconsolate and unenjoined matrimony,\"  whereby the blessing that was expected with her is changed \"into a  familiar and coinhabiting mischief, at least into a drooping and  disconsolate household captivity, without refuge or redemption.\" \"The  mystical and blessed union of marriage can be no way more unhallowed and  profaned, than by the forcible uniting of such disunions and  separations.\" \"And it is a less breach of wedlock to part with wise and  quiet consent betimes, than still to foil and profane that mystery of joy  and union with a polluting sadness and perpetual distemper.\"    The balance of epithet, the delicate music, the sentence that resembles a  chain with link added to link rather than a hoop whose ends are welded  together by the hammer--these are the characteristics of Milton's prose.  They are illustrated in that short passage of the _Areopagitica_, well  known to all readers of English: \"I cannot praise a fugitive and  cloistered virtue, unexercised and unbreathed, that never sallies out and  seeks her adversary, but slinks out of the race, where that immortal  garland is to be run for, not without dust and heat.\" Or in the striking  description of London during the Civil War: \"Behold now this vast city, a  city of refuge, the mansion-house of liberty, encompassed and surrounded  with his protection; the shop of war hath not there more anvils and  hammers working, to fashion out the plates and instruments of armed  justice in defence of beleaguered truth, than there be pens and heads  there, sitting by their studious lamps, musing, searching, revolving new  notions and ideas wherewith to present, as with their homage and their  fealty, the approaching reformation; others as fast reading, trying all  things, assenting to the force of reason and convincement.\"    This sonorous balance of phrase and epithet cannot always escape what  Milton himself calls \"the heathenish battology of multiplying words.\" It  serves the uses of rhetoric rather than of logic, and by the fervour of  its repetitions and enlargements unfits his prose for the plainer  purposes of argument or exposition. His argument is sometimes destroyed  or blemished by the fire that it kindles, his narrative overwhelmed in  the tide of passions that it sways.    His vocabulary is extraordinarily rich, and here again the contrast is  great between his prose and his verse. A full-bodied and"]]]
