You have not, however, at present, a  lion in your zoological collection; and it being, as you are probably  aware, the first principle of Pre-Raphaelitism, as well as essential to  my object in the present instance, that no drawing should be made except  from Nature itself, I was obliged to be content with a tiger's head,  which, however, will answer my purpose just as well, in enabling you to  compare a piece of true, faithful, and natural work with modern  architectural sculpture. Here, in the first place, is Mr. Millais'  drawing from the _living_ beast (_fig._ 17, frontispiece). I have not  the least fear but that you will at once acknowledge its truth and feel  its power. Prepare yourselves next for the Grecian sublimity of the  _ideal_ beast, from the cornice of your schools of design. Behold it  (_fig._ 18).    43. Now we call ourselves civilized and refined in matters of art, but I  assure you it is seldom that, in the very basest and coarsest grotesques  of the inferior Gothic workmen, anything so contemptible as this head  can be ever found. _They_ only sink into such a failure accidentally,  and in a single instance; and we, in our civilization, repeat this noble  piece of work threescore and six times over, as not being able to invent  anything else so good! Do not think Mr. Millais has caricatured it. It  is drawn with the strictest fidelity; photograph one of the heads  to-morrow, and you will find the photograph tell you the same tale.  Neither imagine that this is an unusual example of modern work. Your  banks and public offices are covered with ideal lions' heads in every  direction, and you will find them all just as bad as this. And, farther,  note that the admission of such barbarous types of sculpture is not  _merely_ ridiculous; it is seriously harmful to your powers of  perceiving truth or beauty of any kind or at any time. Imagine the  effect on the minds of your children of having such representations of a  lion's head as this thrust upon them perpetually; and consider what a  different effect might be produced upon them if, instead of this barren  and insipid absurdity, every boss on your buildings were, according to  the workman's best ability, a faithful rendering of the form of some  existing animal, so that all their walls were so many pages of natural  history. And, finally, consider the difference, with respect to the mind  of the workman himself, between being kept all his life carving, by  sixties, and forties, and thirties, repetitions of one false and futile  model,--and being sent, for every piece of work he had to execute, to  make a stern and faithful study from some living creature of God.    [Illustration: PLATE XI. (Fig. 17., Fig. 18.)]    44. And this last consideration enables me to press this subject on you  on far higher grounds than I have done yet.    I have hitherto appealed only to your national pride, or to your common  sense; but surely I should treat a Scottish audience with indignity if I  appealed not finally to something higher than either of them,--to their  religious principles.    You know how often it is difficult to be wisely charitable, to do good  without multiplying the sources of evil. You know that to give alms is  nothing unless you give thought also; and that therefore it is written,  not \"blessed is he that _feedeth_ the poor,\" but, \"blessed is he that  _considereth_ the poor.\" And you know that a little thought and a little  kindness are often worth more than a great deal of money.    45. Now this charity of thought is not merely to be exercised towards  the poor; it is to be exercised towards all men. There is assuredly no  action of our social life, however unimportant, which, by kindly  thought, may not be made to have a beneficial influence upon others; and  it is impossible to spend the smallest sum of money, for any not  absolutely necessary purpose, without a grave responsibility attaching  to the manner of spending it. The object we ourselves covet may, indeed,  be desirable and harmless, so far as we are concerned, but the providing  us with it may, perhaps, be a very prejudicial occupation to some one  else. And then it becomes instantly a moral question, whether we are to  indulge ourselves or not. Whatever we wish to buy, we ought first to  consider not only if the thing be fit for us, but if the manufacture of  it be a wholesome and happy one; and if, on the whole, the sum we are  going to spend will do as much good spent in this way as it would if  spent in any other way. It may be said that we have not time to consider  all this before we make a purchase. But no time could be spent in a more  important duty; and God never imposes a duty without giving the time to  do it. Let us, however, only acknowledge the principle;--once make up  your mind to allow the consideration of the _effect_ of your purchases  to regulate the _kind_ of your purchase, and you will soon easily find  grounds enough to decide upon. The plea of ignorance will never take  away our responsibilities. It is written, \"If thou sayest, Behold, we  knew it not; doth not He that pondereth the heart consider it? and He  that keepeth thy soul, doth not He know it?\"    46. I could press this on you at length, but I hasten to apply the  principle to the subject of art. I will do so broadly at first, and then  come to architecture. Enormous sums are spent annually by this country  in what is called patronage of art, but in what is for the most part  merely buying what strikes our fancies. True and judicious patronage  there is indeed; many a work of art is bought by those who do not care  for its possession, to assist the struggling artist, or relieve the  unsuccessful one. But for the most part, I fear we are too much in the  habit of buying simply what we like best, wholly irrespective of any  good to be done, either to the artist or to the schools of the country.  Now let us remember, that every farthing we spend on objects of art has  influence over men's minds and spirits, far more than over their bodies.  By the purchase of every print which hangs on your walls, of every cup  out of which you drink, and every table off which you eat your bread,  you are educating a mass of men in one way or another. You are either  employing them healthily or unwholesomely; you are making them lead  happy or unhappy lives; you are leading them to look at Nature, and to  love her--to think, to feel, to enjoy,--or you are blinding them to  Nature, and keeping them bound, like beasts of burden, in mechanical and  monotonous employments. We shall all be asked one day, why we did not  think more of this.    47. \"Well, but,\" you will say, \"how can we decide what we ought to buy,  but by our likings? You would not have us buy what we don't like?\" No,  but I would have you thoroughly sure that there _is_ an absolute right  and wrong in all art, and try to find out the right, and like that; and,  secondly, sometimes to sacrifice a careless preference or fancy, to what  you know is for the good of your fellow-creatures. For instance, when  you spend a guinea upon an engraving, what have you done? You have paid  a man for a certain number of hours to sit at a dirty table, in a dirty  room, inhaling the fumes of nitric acid, stooping over a steel plate, on  which, by the help of a magnifying glass, he is, one by one, laboriously  cutting out certain notches and scratches, of which the effect is to be  the copy of another man's work. You cannot suppose you have done a very  charitable thing in this! On the other hand, whenever you buy a small  water-color drawing, you have employed a man happily and healthily,  working in a clean room (if he likes), or more probably still, out in  the pure country and fresh air, thinking about something, and learning  something every moment; not straining his eyesight, nor breaking his  back, but working in ease and happiness. Therefore if you _can_ like a  modest water-color better than an elaborate engraving, do. There may  indeed be engravings which are worth the suffering it costs to produce  them; but at all events, engravings of public dinners and laying of  foundation-stones, and such things, might be dispensed with. The  engraving ought to be a first-rate picture of a first-rate subject to be  worth buying.    48. Farther, I know that many conscientious persons are desirous of  encouraging art, but feel at the same time that their judgment is not  certain enough to secure their choice of the best kind of art. To such  persons I would now especially address myself, fully admitting the  greatness of their difficulty. It is not an easy thing to acquire a  knowledge of painting; and it is by no means a desirable thing to  encourage bad painting. One bad painter makes another, and one bad  painting will often spoil a great many healthy judgments. I could name  popular painters now living, who have retarded the taste of their  generation by twenty years. Unless, therefore, we are certain not merely  that we like a painting, but that we are _right_ in liking it, we should  never buy it. For there is one way of spending money which is perfectly  safe, and in which we may be absolutely sure of doing good. I mean, by  paying for simple sculpture of natural objects, chiefly flowers and  animals. You are aware that the possibilities of error in sculpture are  much less than in painting; it is altogether an easier and simpler art,  invariably attaining perfection long before painting, in the progress of  a national mind. It may indeed be corrupted by false taste, or thrown  into erroneous forms; but for the most part, the feebleness of a  sculptor is shown in imperfection and rudeness, rather than in definite  error. He does not reach the fineness of the forms of Nature; but he  approaches them truly up to a certain point, or, if not so, at all  events an honest effort will continually improve him: so that if we set "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/236"],[0,"The Jungle Book (#11)"],[1,"scolded him, Mowgli threatened to put him on the donkey too, and the  priest told Messua's husband that Mowgli had better be set to work as  soon as possible; and the village head-man told Mowgli that he would  have to go out with the buffaloes next day, and herd them while they  grazed. No one was more pleased than Mowgli; and that night, because he  had been appointed a servant of the village, as it were, he went off  to a circle that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great  fig-tree. It was the village club, and the head-man and the watchman and  the barber, who knew all the gossip of the village, and old Buldeo, the  village hunter, who had a Tower musket, met and smoked. The monkeys  sat and talked in the upper branches, and there was a hole under the  platform where a cobra lived, and he had his little platter of milk  every night because he was sacred; and the old men sat around the tree  and talked, and pulled at the big huqas (the water-pipes) till far into  the night. They told wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts; and  Buldeo told even more wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the  jungle, till the eyes of the children sitting outside the circle bulged  out of their heads. Most of the tales were about animals, for the jungle  was always at their door. The deer and the wild pig grubbed up their  crops, and now and again the tiger carried off a man at twilight, within  sight of the village gates.    Mowgli, who naturally knew something about what they were talking of,  had to cover his face not to show that he was laughing, while Buldeo,  the Tower musket across his knees, climbed on from one wonderful story  to another, and Mowgli's shoulders shook.    Buldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away Messua's son  was a ghost-tiger, and his body was inhabited by the ghost of a wicked,  old money-lender, who had died some years ago. \"And I know that this is  true,\" he said, \"because Purun Dass always limped from the blow that he  got in a riot when his account books were burned, and the tiger that I  speak of he limps, too, for the tracks of his pads are unequal.\"    \"True, true, that must be the truth,\" said the gray-beards, nodding  together.    \"Are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk?\" said Mowgli. \"That  tiger limps because he was born lame, as everyone knows. To talk of the  soul of a money-lender in a beast that never had the courage of a jackal  is child's talk.\"    Buldeo was speechless with surprise for a moment, and the head-man  stared.    \"Oho! It is the jungle brat, is it?\" said Buldeo. \"If thou art so  wise, better bring his hide to Khanhiwara, for the Government has set  a hundred rupees on his life. Better still, talk not when thy elders  speak.\"    Mowgli rose to go. \"All the evening I have lain here listening,\" he  called back over his shoulder, \"and, except once or twice, Buldeo has  not said one word of truth concerning the jungle, which is at his very  doors. How, then, shall I believe the tales of ghosts and gods and  goblins which he says he has seen?\"    \"It is full time that boy went to herding,\" said the head-man, while  Buldeo puffed and snorted at Mowgli's impertinence.    The custom of most Indian villages is for a few boys to take the cattle  and buffaloes out to graze in the early morning, and bring them back  at night. The very cattle that would trample a white man to death allow  themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that  hardly come up to their noses. So long as the boys keep with the herds  they are safe, for not even the tiger will charge a mob of cattle. But  if they straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards, they are sometimes  carried off. Mowgli went through the village street in the dawn, sitting  on the back of Rama, the great herd bull. The slaty-blue buffaloes,  with their long, backward-sweeping horns and savage eyes, rose out their  byres, one by one, and followed him, and Mowgli made it very clear to  the children with him that he was the master. He beat the buffaloes with  a long, polished bamboo, and told Kamya, one of the boys, to graze the  cattle by themselves, while he went on with the buffaloes, and to be  very careful not to stray away from the herd.    An Indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrub and tussocks and little  ravines, among which the herds scatter and disappear. The buffaloes  generally keep to the pools and muddy places, where they lie wallowing  or basking in the warm mud for hours. Mowgli drove them on to the edge  of the plain where the Waingunga came out of the jungle; then he dropped  from Rama's neck, trotted off to a bamboo clump, and found Gray Brother.  \"Ah,\" said Gray Brother, \"I have waited here very many days. What is the  meaning of this cattle-herding work?\"    \"It is an order,\" said Mowgli. \"I am a village herd for a while. What  news of Shere Khan?\"    \"He has come back to this country, and has waited here a long time for  thee. Now he has gone off again, for the game is scarce. But he means to  kill thee.\"    \"Very good,\" said Mowgli. \"So long as he is away do thou or one of the  four brothers sit on that rock, so that I can see thee as I come out of  the village. When he comes back wait for me in the ravine by the dhak  tree in the center of the plain. We need not walk into Shere Khan's  mouth.\"    Then Mowgli picked out a shady place, and lay down and slept while  the buffaloes grazed round him. Herding in India is one of the laziest  things in the world. The cattle move and crunch, and lie down, and move  on again, and they do not even low. They only grunt, and the buffaloes  very seldom say anything, but get down into the muddy pools one after  another, and work their way into the mud till only their noses and  staring china-blue eyes show above the surface, and then they lie like  logs. The sun makes the rocks dance in the heat, and the herd children  hear one kite (never any more) whistling almost out of sight overhead,  and they know that if they died, or a cow died, that kite would sweep  down, and the next kite miles away would see him drop and follow, and  the next, and the next, and almost before they were dead there would be  a score of hungry kites come out of nowhere. Then they sleep and  wake and sleep again, and weave little baskets of dried grass and put  grasshoppers in them; or catch two praying mantises and make them fight;  or string a necklace of red and black jungle nuts; or watch a lizard  basking on a rock, or a snake hunting a frog near the wallows. Then they  sing long, long songs with odd native quavers at the end of them, and  the day seems longer than most people's whole lives, and perhaps they  make a mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes, and  put reeds into the men's hands, and pretend that they are kings and the  figures are their armies, or that they are gods to be worshiped. Then  evening comes and the children call, and the buffaloes lumber up out of  the sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after the other,  and they all string across the gray plain back to the twinkling village  lights.    Day after day Mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their wallows, and  day after day he would see Gray Brother's back a mile and a half away  across the plain (so he knew that Shere Khan had not come back), and day  after day he would lie on the grass listening to the noises round him,  and dreaming of old days in the jungle. If Shere Khan had made a false  step with his lame paw up in the jungles by the Waingunga, Mowgli would  have heard him in those long, still mornings.    At last a day came when he did not see Gray Brother at the signal place,  and he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the dhk tree,  which was all covered with golden-red flowers. There sat Gray Brother,  every bristle on his back lifted.    \"He has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard. He crossed the  ranges last night with Tabaqui, hot-foot on thy trail,\" said the Wolf,  panting.    Mowgli frowned. \"I am not afraid of Shere Khan, but Tabaqui is very  cunning.\"    \"Have no fear,\" said Gray Brother, licking his lips a little. \"I met  Tabaqui in the dawn. Now he is telling all his wisdom to the kites, but  he told me everything before I broke his back. Shere Khan's plan is to  wait for thee at the village gate this evening--for thee and for no one  else. He is lying up now, in the big dry ravine of the Waingunga.\"    \"Has he eaten today, or does he hunt empty?\" said Mowgli, for the answer  meant life and death to him.    \"He killed at dawn,--a pig,--and he has drunk too. Remember, Shere Khan  could never fast, even for the sake of revenge.\"    \"Oh! Fool, fool! What a cub's cub it is! Eaten and drunk too, and he  thinks that I shall wait till he has slept! Now, where does he lie up?  If there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he lies. These  buffaloes will not charge unless they wind him, and I cannot speak their  language. Can we get behind his track so that they may smell it?\"    \"He swam far down the Waingunga to cut that off,\" said Gray Brother.    \"Tabaqui told him that, I know. He would never have thought of it  alone.\" Mowgli stood with his finger in his mouth, thinking. \"The big  ravine of the Waingunga. That opens out on the plain not half a mile  from here. I can take the herd round through the jungle to the head of  the ravine and then sweep down--but he would slink out at the foot. We  must block that end. Gray Brother, canst thou cut the herd in two for  me?\"    \"Not I, perhaps--but I have brought a wise helper.\" Gray Brother trotted  off and dropped into a hole. Then there lifted up a huge gray head that  Mowgli knew well, and the hot air was filled with the most desolate cry  of all the jungle--the hunting howl of a wolf at midday.    \"Akela! Akela!\" said Mowgli, clapping his hands. \"I might have known  that thou wouldst not forget me. We have a big work in hand."]]]
