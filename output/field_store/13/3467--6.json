Fortunately, a wig was found in the Judge's private room, and Bill put  it on with great satisfaction.    'I'm afraid this is unconstitutional,' said the Mayor to the Constable.    [Illustration]    'It is unconstitutional,' said the Constable; 'but it's better than  getting a punch on the snout.'    The Mayor turned so pale at this that the Constable had to thrust a  banana into his mouth to restore his courage.    'Thank you,' said the Mayor, peevishly; 'but, on the whole, I prefer to  be restored with peeled bananas.'    'Order in the jury box,' said Bill, sharply, and the Mayor having  hurriedly bolted his banana, peel and all, proceedings commenced.    [Illustration]    'Gentlemen of the Jury,' said Bill, 'the case before you is one  aboundin' in horror and amazement. Persons of the lowest morals has  disguised themselves in pot-hats in order to decoy a Puddin' of tender  years from his lawful guardians. It is related in the archives of the  Noble Order of Puddin'-owners that previous to this dastardly attempt a  valuable bag, the property of Sir Benjimen Brandysnap, had been stolen  and the said Puddin'-owners invited to look at a present inside it. The  said bag was then pulled over their heads, compelling the Puddin'-owners  aforesaid to endure agonies of partial suffocation, let alone walkin' on  each other's corns for several hours. Had not Sir Benjimen, the noble  owner, appeared like a guardian angel and undone the bag, it is doubtful  if Sir Samuel Sawnoff's corns could have stood the strain much longer,  his groans bein' such as would have brought tears to the eyes of a  hard-boiled egg.'    [Illustration]    'A very moving story,' said the Constable, and the Mayor was so affected  that the Constable had to stuff a banana into his mouth to prevent him  bursting into tears.    'I now propose to call Sir Benjimen Brandysnap as first witness for the  prosecution,' said Bill. 'Kindly step into the witness-box, Sir  Benjimen, and relate the circumstances ensuin' on your bag bein' stole.'    Benjimen stepped into the box, and, taking a piece of paper from his egg  basket, said solemnly: 'I was very busy that morning, Gentlemen of the  Jury, owing to the activity of the vegetables, as hereunder described--      'On Tuesday morn, as it happened by chance,      The parsnips stormed in a rage,    Because the young carrots were singing like parrots      On top of the onions' cage.      'The radishes swarmed on the angry air      Around with the bumble bees,    While the brussels-sprouts were pulling the snouts      Of all the young French peas.      'The artichokes bounded up and down      On top of the pumpkins' heads,    And the cabbage was dancing the highland fling      All over the onion beds.      'So I hadn't much time, as Your Honour perceives,    For watching the habits of puddin'-thieves.'    'Tut, tut, Sir Benjimen,' said Bill, 'stir up your memory, sir; cast  your eye over them felons in the dock, and tell the Court how you seen  them steal the bag.'    'The fact is,' said Benjimen, after studying the puddin'-thieves  carefully, 'as they had their backs turned to me when they were engaged  in stealing the bag, I should be able to judge better if they were  turned round.'    'Officer,' said Bill to Bunyip Bluegum, 'kindly turn the felons' backs  to the witness.'    The Possum and the Wombat objected, saying there wasn't room enough in  the witness-box to turn round, so it was found necessary to twist their  snouts the opposite way.    'From this aspect,' said Ben, 'I have no hesitation in saying that those  are the backs that stole the bags.'    'Make a note of that, Gentlemen of the Jury,' said Bill, and the  Constable obligingly made a note of it on his banana bag.    'The identity of the bag-stealers bein' now settled,' went on Bill, 'I  shall kindly ask Sir Benjimen to step down, and call on Sir Samuel  Sawnoff to ascend the witness-box.'    Sam stepped up cheerfully, but, as the witness-box was the wrong size  for Penguins, they had to hand him a chair to stand on.    [Illustration]    'Now, Sir Samuel,' said Bill, impressively, 'I am about to ask you a  most important leadin' question. Do you happen to notice such a thing  as a Puddin' in the precinks of the Court?'    [Illustration]    Sam shaded his eyes with his flapper and, seeing the Puddin' on the  bench, started back dramatically.    'Do my eyes deceive me, or is yon object a Puddin'?' he cried.    'Well acted,' said the Mayor, and the Constable clapped loudly.    'I am now about to ask you another leadin' question,' said Bill. 'Do you  recognize that Puddin'?'    'Do I recognize that Puddin'?' cried Sam in thrilling tones. 'That  Puddin', sir, is dearer to me than an Uncle. That Puddin', sir, an' me  has registered vows of eternal friendship and esteem.    [Illustration]      'That Puddin', sir, an' me have sailed the seas,    Known tropic suns, and braved the Arctic breeze,    We've heard on Popocatepetl's peak    The savage Tom-Tom sharpenin' of his beak,    We've served the dreadful Jim-Jam up on toast,    When shipwrecked off the Coromandel coast,    And when we heard the frightful Bim-Bam rave,    Have plunged beneath the Salonican wave.    We've delved for Bulbuls' eggs on coral strands,    And chased the Pompeydon in distant lands.    That Puddin', sir, and me, has, back to back,    Withstood the fearful Rumty Tums' attack,    And swum the Indian Ocean for our lives,    Pursued by Oysters, armed with oyster knives.    Let me but say, e'er these adventures cloy,    I've knowed that Puddin' since he were a boy.'    [Illustration]    'All lies,' sang out the Puddin', looking over the rim of his basin.  'For well you know that you and old Bill Barnacle collared me off Curry  and Rice after rolling him off the iceberg.'    'Albert, Albert,' said Bill, sternly. 'Where's your manners:  interruptin' Sir Samuel in that rude way, and him a-performin' like an  actor for your deliverance!'    'How much longer do you expect me to stay up here, bein' guzzled by  these legal land-crabs?' demanded the Puddin'.    'You shall stay there, Albert, till the case is well and truly tried by  these here noble Peers of the Realm assembled,' said Bill, impressively.    'Too much style about you,' said the Puddin', rudely, and he threw the  Judge's glass of port into Bill's face, remarking: 'Take that, for being  a pumpkin-headed old shellback.'    There was a great uproar over this very illegal act. The Judge was  enraged at losing his port, and the Mayor was filled with horror because  Bill wiped his face on the mayoral hat. Sam had to feign amazement at  being called a liar, and the puddin'-thieves kept shouting: 'Time, time;  we can't stand here all day.'    [Illustration]    In desperation, Bill bawled at the top of his voice: 'I call on  Detective Bluegum to restore order in the Court.'    Bunyip ran into the witness-box and, with a ready wit, shouted: 'I have  dreadful news to impart to this honourable Court.'    All eyes, of course, turned on Bunyip, who, raising his hand with an  impressive gesture, said in thrilling tones: 'From information  received, it has been discovered that the Puddin' was poisoned at  ten-thirty this morning.'    This news restored order at once. The Judge turned pale as lard, and the  Usher, having a darker complexion, turned as pale as soap. The Puddin'  couldn't turn pale, so he let out a howl of terror.    'Poisoned,' said the Usher, feebly. 'How, how?'    'Poisoned,' said the Judge, feeling his stomach with trembling hands.  'Until this moment I was under the delusion that a somewhat unpleasant  sensation of being, as it were, distended, was merely due to having  eaten seven slices. But if--'    [Illustration]    'If,' said the Usher, in a quavering voice--      'If you take a poisoned Puddin'      And that poisoned Puddin' chew    The sensations that you suffer      I should rather say were due    To the poison in the Puddin'      In the act of Poisoning You.    And I think the fact suffices      Through this dreadfulest of crimes,    As you've eaten seven slices      You've been poisoned seven times.'    'It was your idea having it up on the bench,' said the Judge, angrily,  to the Usher. 'Now,      'If what you say is true,    That idea you'll sadly rue,    The poison I have eaten is entirely due to you.    It's by taking your advice    That I've had my seventh slice,    So I'll tell you what I'll do    Why, I'll beat you black and blue,'    and with that he hit the Usher a smart crack on the head with a port  bottle.    'Don't strike a poisoned man,' shouted the Usher; but the Judge went on  smacking and cracking him with the bottle, singing--      'The emotion of pity      Need never be sought    In a Judge who's been poisoned      By Puddin' and Port.'    In desperation, the Usher leapt off the bench, and landed head first in  the dock, where he stuck like a sardine.    [Illustration]    'Too bad, too bad,' shouted the puddin'-thieves. 'Crowding in here where  there's only room for two.' Before they could get rid of the Usher, the  Judge bounded over the bench and commenced whacking them with the  bottle, singing--      'As I find great satisfaction      Hitting anybody who    Can offer that distraction,      Why, I'll have a go at you,'  and he went on bounding and whacking away with the bottle, while the  puddin'-thieves kept roaring, and the Usher kept screaming. The uproar  was deafening.    'Just listen to it,' said Bill, in despair. 'I'd like to know how on  earth we are going to finish the case with all this umptydoodle rumpus  going on.'    'Why,' said Bunyip, 'the simpler course is not to finish the case at  all.'    'Solved, as usual,' said Bill and, seizing the Puddin' from the bench,  he dashed out of Court, followed by Sam, Ben, and Bunyip Bluegum.    As they ran they could hear the Judge still whacking away at everybody,  including the Mayor, and the Constable, whose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23626"],[0,"The Chemistry, Properties and Tests of Precious Stones (#11)"],[1,"surfaces, opaque and translucent stones, such as the moonstone,  cat's-eye, etc., are mostly cut _en cabochon_, that is, dome-shaped or  semi-circular at the top, flat on the underside, and when the garnet is  so cut it is called a carbuncle. In strongly coloured stones, while the  upper surface is semi-circular like the cabochon, the under surface is  more or less deeply concave, sometimes following the curve of the upper  surface, the thickness of the stone being in that case almost parallel  throughout. This is called the \"hollow\" cabochon. Other stones are cut  so that the upper surface is dome-shaped like the last two, but the  lower is more or less convex, though not so deep as to make the stone  spherical. This is called the \"double\" cabochon.    A further variety of cutting is known as the _goutte de suif_, or the  \"tallow-drop,\" which takes the form of a somewhat flattened or  long-focus double-convex lens. The more complicated varieties of cut are  those appearing in the second group, or those with plane surfaces. A  very old form is the \"rose\" or \"rosette\"; in this the extreme upper  centre, called the \"crown,\" or \"star,\" is usually composed of six  triangles, the apexes of which are elevated and joined together, forming  one point in the centre. From their bases descend a further series of  triangles, the bases and apexes of which are formed by the bases and  lower angles of the upper series. This lower belt is called the \"teeth,\"  under which the surface or base of the stone is usually flat, but  sometimes partakes of a similar shape to the upper surface, though  somewhat modified in form.    Another variety is called the \"table cut,\" and is used for coloured  stones. It has a flat top or \"table\" of a square or other shape, the  edges of which slope outwards and form the \"bezils\" or that extended  portion by which the stone is held in its setting. It will thus be seen  that the outside of the stone is of the same shape as that of the  \"table,\" but larger, so that from every portion of the \"table\" the  surface extends downwards, sloping outwards to the extreme size of the  stone, the underside sloping downwards and inwards to a small and flat  base, the whole, in section, being not unlike the section of a \"pegtop.\"    A modification of this is known as the \"step\" cut, sometimes also called  the \"trap.\" Briefly, the difference between this and the last is that  whereas the table has usually one bevel on the upper and lower surfaces,  the trap has one or more steps in the sloping parts, hence its name.    The most common of all, and usually applied only to the diamond, is the  \"brilliant\" cut. This is somewhat complicated, and requires detailed  description. In section, the shape is substantially that of a pegtop  with a flat \"table\" top and a small flat base. The widest portion is  that on which the claws, or other form of setting, hold it securely in  position. This portion is called the \"girdle,\" and if we take this as a  defining line, that portion which appears above the setting of this  girdle, is called the \"crown\"; the portion below the girdle is called  the \"culasse,\" or less commonly the \"pavilion.\" Commencing with the  girdle upwards, we have eight \"cross facets\" in four pairs, a pair on  each side; each pair having their apexes together, meeting on the four  extremities of two lines drawn laterally at right angles through the  stone. It will, therefore, be seen that one side of each triangle  coincides with the girdle, and as their bases do not meet, these spaces  are occupied by eight small triangles, called \"skill facets,\" each of  which has, as its base, the girdle, and the outer of its sides coincides  with the base of the adjoining \"cross facet.\" The two inner sides of  each pair of skill facets form the half of a diamond or lozenge-shaped  facet, called a \"quoin,\" of which there are four. The inner or upper  half of each of these four quoins forms the bases of two triangles, one  at each side, making eight in all, which are called \"star facets,\" and  the inner lines of these eight star facets form the boundary of the top  of the stone, called the \"table.\" The inner lines also of the star  facets immediately below the table and those of the cross facets  immediately above the girdle form four \"templets,\" or \"bezils.\" We thus  have above the girdle, thirty-three facets: 8 cross, 8 skill, 4 quoin, 8  star, 1 table, and 4 templets.    Reversing the stone and again commencing at the girdle, we have eight  \"skill facets,\" sometimes called the lower skill facets, the bases of  which are on the girdle, their outer sides forming the bases of eight  cross facets, the apexes of which meet on the extremities of the  horizontal line, as in those above the girdle. If the basal lines of  these cross facets, where they join the sides of the skill facets, are  extended to the peak, or narrow end of the stone, these lines, together  with the sides of the cross facets, will form four five-sided facets,  called the \"pavilions\"; the spaces between these four pavilions have  their ends nearest the girdle formed by the inner sides of the skill  facets, and of these spaces, there will, of course, be four, which also  are five-sided figures, and are called \"quoins,\" so that there are eight  five-sided facets--four large and four narrow--their bases forming a  square, with a small portion of each corner cut away; the bases of the  broader pavilions form the four sides, whilst the bases of the four  narrower quoins cut off the corners of the square, and this flat  portion, bounded by the eight bases, is called the \"culet,\" but more  commonly \"collet.\" So that below the girdle, we find twenty-five facets:  8 cross, 8 skill, 4 pavilion, 4 quoin, and 1 collet.    These, with the 33 of the crown, make 58, which is the usual number of  facets in a brilliant, though this varies with the character, quality,  and size of the diamond. For instance, though this number is considered  the best for normal stones, specially large ones often have more,  otherwise there is danger of their appearing dull, and it requires a  vast amount of skill and experience to decide upon the particular number  and size of the facets that will best display the fire and brilliance of  a large stone, for it is obvious that if, after months of cutting and  polishing, it is found that a greater or smaller number of facets ought  to have been allowed, the error cannot be retrieved without considerable  loss, and probable ruin to the stone. In the case of the Cullinan  diamonds, the two largest of which are called the Stars of Africa, 74  facets were cut in the largest portion, while in the next largest the  experts decided to make 66, and, as already pointed out, these stones  are, up to the present time, the most magnificent in fire, beauty and  purity ever discovered.    The positions and angles of the facets, as well as the number, are of  supreme importance, and diamond cutters--even though they have rules  regulating these matters, according to the weight and size of the  stone--must exercise the greatest care and exactitude, for their  decision once made is practically unalterable.          CHAPTER XII.    IMITATIONS, AND SOME OF THE TESTS, OF PRECIOUS STONES.      We now arrive at the point where it is necessary to discuss the  manufacture and re-formation of precious stones, and also to consider a  few of the tests which may be applied to _all_ stones. These are given  here in order to save needless repetition; the tests which are specially  applicable to individual stones will more properly be found under the  description of the stone referred to, so that the present chapter will  be devoted chiefly to generalities.    With regard to diamonds, the manufacture of these has not as yet been  very successful. As will be seen on reference to Chapter II., on \"the  Origin of Precious Stones,\" it is generally admitted that these  beautiful and valuable minerals are caused by chemically-charged water  and occasionally, though not always, high temperature, but invariably  beautified and brought to the condition in which they are obtained by  the action of weight and pressure, extending unbroken through perhaps  ages of time.    In these circumstances, science, though able to give chemical  properties and pressure, cannot, of course, maintain these continuously  for \"ages,\" therefore the chemist must manufacture the jewels in such  manner that he may soon see the results of his labours, and though real  diamonds may be made, and with comparative ease, from boron in the  amorphous or pure state along with aluminium, fused in a crucible at a  high temperature, these diamonds are but microscopic, nor can a number  of them be fused, or in any other way converted into a large single  stone, so that imitation stones, to be of any service must be made of a  good clear glass. The glass for this purpose is usually composed of  53.70 per cent. of red lead, 38.48 per cent. of pure quartz in fine  powder, preferably water-ground, and 7.82 per cent. of carbonate of  potash, the whole coloured when necessary with metallic oxides of a  similar nature to the constituents of the natural stones imitated. But  for colourless diamonds, the glass requires no such addition to tint it.  From the formula given is made the material known as \"strass,\" or  \"paste,\" and stones made of it are mostly exhibited under and amongst  brilliant artificial lights. The mere fact that they are sold cheaply is  _prima facie_ proof that the stones are glass, for it is evident that a  diamond, the commercial value of which might be L50 or more, cannot be  purchased for a few shillings and be genuine. So long as this is  understood and the stone is sold for the few shillings, no harm is done;  but to offer it as a genuine stone and at the price of a genuine stone,  would amount to fraud, and be punishable accordingly.
