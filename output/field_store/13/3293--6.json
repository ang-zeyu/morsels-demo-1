[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19850"],[0,"The Human Side of Animals (#11)"],[1,"    Throughout the vast network of tunnels every inch of wall space seems  quite smooth and polished. This is due to the continuous pressure of the  mole's fur against the walls. Thus there is little danger of the walls  collapsing even after a rain-storm. No human being knows just why the  mole has such a complex system of underground streets and tunnels;  perhaps it is because he finds that a greater feeling of safety  surrounds his home when he knows that in case of danger he can escape in  a dozen directions. Surely he is the original builder of labyrinths!    How marvellous that so tiny a creature can build such a fortress! The  complex chambers and circular galleries do justice to an artist. The  space of ground covered by a single mole's roads and galleries is  almost unbelievable; in every direction from the fortress they run, and  are sunk at various depths, according to the condition of the mole's  hunting-grounds, which are really the spaces of ground through which he  tunnels. Worms and underground insects are his chief food. Sometimes he  ploughs along the surface of the ground, and exposes his back as he  works; but if the weather is dry, he ploughs deeply into the earth for  worms. He fills his storehouse with earth-worms for winter use, and he  finds it necessary to bite their heads off, which leaves them inert but  not dead. This cannot be done in the summer months without the heads  re-growing and the worms crawling away. The mole knows the exact  temperature best suited for keeping his meat fresh!    A most interesting and beautiful family of miner-cousins of the moles  are the shrews. They are excavators of great ability, and because of  their nocturnal habits are rarely seen alive. They are very similar to  the mole, though much more handsome. Their domicile is built of dry  grass at the end of a tunnel.    The shrew mole of North America is a ground-digger of great ingenuity.  He is second only to the mole in the extent and pretensions of his  engineering and tunnelling. His eyes are very small and deeply hidden  in his fur. During the day he constantly comes to the surface of the  earth, and one may catch him by driving a hoe or spade underneath him.    Another underground-dweller is the elephant shrew of South America. He  has a long nose, thick fur, short ears, and, unlike his cousins, he  loves to bask in the warm sunshine. At the least signal of alarm he  darts away to his subterranean home. As a mining engineer he is  unexcelled; he sinks his tunnels by first boring an almost perpendicular  shaft, and then making his burrows at an angle. It is a sad day for  earth-worms when he decides to locate in their vicinity!    It is not an easy task to classify the homes of animals. Many of them  have characteristics that entitle them to be placed under several  groupings. The otter, for example, might be classed as a cave-dweller,  as he seeks refuge in caves; yet he also rears his young in underground  nests as a burrowing animal. But few naturalists believe that he does  his own digging. This is not surprising when we remember that there are  many other animals that live in caves and grottoes, and like the otter,  seek ready-made homes for their convenience. Among these may be  mentioned three American salamanders, bats, and a few strange mice, who  seek darkness and constant temperature, and therefore find caves best  suited to their needs.    The same is true of the weasel, who is thought to be a great burrower,  but in fact, like our remote cave-dwelling ancestors, makes his home  only in caves, in rocky crevices, and under the gnarled roots of old  trees. He is a bright-eyed little creature, with a slender snake-like  neck and red body. He is a great friend of mankind, as he does more  toward eradicating mice and other nocturnal depredators than all the  rat-catchers in the land. His home is quite ordinary compared to that of  the more ambitious underground-dwellers.    A near cousin of the weasel, and a most ingenious engineer and miner, is  the badger. He is a tenement-dweller and builds his home in the deep,  shady woods. His home is rather pretentious with several chambers, and a  most delightfully furnished nursery which is warmly padded with dry  grass and moss.    The badger, once so plentiful in England and America, is fast passing  away because of the increase of towns and cities. As soon as the forest  in which he dwells is drained and converted into farm land, the badger  disappears. He is driven from the soil where he once held sway, and is  one of those unfortunate animals which are eliminated by man-made  civilisation.    The fox of the Far North is a famous excavator, and his underground home  which shelters and protects him from the extreme cold is most spacious.  It is a strange fact that these cunning little animals rarely make their  homes away from others of their kind. Sometimes twenty to thirty are  found in close proximity. And their owners are unquestionably the  smartest, keenest, and quickest creatures that roam the wilds. While  some of their deeds are questionable, their quick wits and nimble bodies  excite our admiration.    These arctic foxes really build small cities, and their semi-social life  may be accounted for by the peculiar suitability of the place which they  select for a habitation. Their homes are usually in a sandy hill, where  it is very easy for them to burrow; and the strangest part of the whole  city is that each burrow is complete and entirely independent in itself.  There are many winding paths and tunnels in each house, but each belongs  exclusively to its owner and never winds into a neighbour's house. In  case of danger the fox has many directions in which he may escape.    The nursery is the most carefully arranged of all the rooms. It is  rather small and is directly connected with the main outer chamber  somewhat like the nursery of the mole. So skilfully is it situated that  it sometimes happens a hunter will dig into a fox's burrow and never  discover the nest of young, and later the clever mother will return to  carry away her babes, which are usually five to six in number. Adjoining  the nursery are two or three storage rooms filled with food for the  winter. The number of bones usually found in the basement indicates that  a great variety of ducks, fish, hares, lemming, and stoats are regularly  eaten, and that the average fox family does not want for food.    The arctic fox is not only a beauty in his coat of pure white, but is  unusually brainy. Persecuted animals, like persecuted human beings,  become very wise. Nature is kind to the fox in his arctic home, and in  the winter turns his coat snow white so that he may easily escape his  enemies--especially men, who seek his beautiful fur and edible body. He  is skilled in his distrust of wires, sticks, guns and strings! No man  knows better than he the meaning of foot-tracks in the snow, and how  long they have been there, and which way they lead; thus, those that  survive their enemies have acquired extreme wisdom, and keep carefully  away from everything that is at all suspicious to their eyes and  nostrils.    The Siberian fox is one of those wise creatures that has defied in a  most extraordinary way his handicaps, and, refusing to admit them, has  boldly selected the strangest dwelling-place known to the animal  world--the horn of the mountain sheep. This unique dwelling-place has  been the home of the Siberian fox for ages, and his ancestors have known  no other. The mountain sheep, which are giants among their kind, have  the longest horns in proportion to their size of any animal in  existence. The argali of Siberia is the largest of all sheep, and is  equal in bulk and weight to an average-sized ox, with horns  proportionally large. The horns of these animals are strikingly like  those of the Rocky Mountain sheep of America, except they are much  larger. They spring up from the forehead, tilt backward, then boldly  curve below the muzzle, before finally again pointing upward and  tapering into a sharp and delicate point. They are hollow, though  exceedingly stout and elastic, and strengthened on the outside by a  number of ridges or horny rings set very close together. They are found  in large numbers in this land of perpetual ice and snow, and it is  thought that they break from the sheep's heads very easily.    It is not uncommon to find them lying in a spot which has been a  battlefield, where two sheep in attempting to settle some dispute have  fought and fallen. It is not long after they have thus fallen before  they are utilised by Mr. Fox. He stores himself carefully away in these  roomy horns, one of which Mrs. Fox uses as a nursery, finding it a snug,  safe, and warm place to rear her little family.    The other varieties of foxes, especially the grey and red, are not so  skilled in home-making. This may be due to the fact that they do not  have need of such elaborate houses as their arctic cousins. Again, it  may be that the existence of numerous deserted homes of badgers, or even  rabbits, makes it unnecessary for them to spend their time in building  homes of their own. It is much easier to enlarge the ready-made burrow  of a rabbit than to dig a new tunnel, of course.    If there is no ready-made burrow to be had, then the wise fox sets to  work and scoops out his own. Herein he sleeps all the day, and comes  forth only at night. A small chamber from the main room serves as the  nursery, and here the babies are born and nurtured. Nothing is more  beautiful than to see the entire family--mother, father, and  children--come forth at evening to play. The young are as sportive as  pups, but they never wander far from home. Their broad heads, grey  coats, short tails and awkward appearance would lead no one to think  that they were the children of handsome, nimble-limbed, intelligent Mrs.  Fox!

Perhaps it's under the table too.\"    \"Hold your nonsense,\" cried Ferrers, angrily. \"It's very shabby of you  to hinder me in this manner.\"    Louis quietly slipped an inkstand near him, an action of which Ferrers  was quite aware, and though he pretended not to notice it, he availed  himself presently of the convenience. A racking headache, however,  almost disabled him from thinking, and though he was really unwell,  there was only the boy he had so cruelly injured who felt any sympathy  for his suffering.    Louis carefully avoided any direct manifestation of his anxiety to  return good for evil, for he felt, though he hardly knew why, that  his actions would be misconstrued, but whenever any little opportunity  occurred in which he could really render any service, he was always  as ready to do it for Ferrers as for another; and now, when from his  classmates Ferrers met with nothing but jokes on his \"beautiful temper,\"  and \"placid state of mind,\" he could not help feeling the gentleness of  Louis' conduct, the absence of pleasure in his annoyance, and the look  of evident sympathy he met whenever he accidentally turned his eyes in  his direction. For a few days after this he was obliged to keep his bed,  and during this time, though Louis only once saw him, he thought of every  little kind attention he could, that might be grateful to the invalid.  Knowing that he was not a favorite, and that few in the school would  trouble themselves about him, he borrowed books and sent them to him for  his amusement, and empowered the old cake man to procure some grapes,  which he sent up to him by a servant, with strict orders to say nothing  of where they came from. The servant met Hamilton at the door of the  room, and he relieved her of her charge, and as she did not consider  herself under promise of secrecy towards him, she mentioned it, desiring  him at the same time to say nothing to Ferrers.    Louis had now established a regular time for doing his own lessons,  and kept to it with great perseverance to the end of the half-year,  with one exception, when he had been acting prisoner in a trial  performed in the school-room, by half his own class and the third,  and let the evening slip by without remembering how late it grew.  His class-fellows were in the same predicament as himself, and as  they had barely time to write a necessary exercise, they agreed among  themselves to learn each his own piece of the lesson they had to repeat.  Louis did not seriously consider the deceit they were practising, and  adopted the same plan. One of the number, not trusting to his memory,  hit upon the singular expedient of writing the whole of his piece and  the next on a piece of paper, and wafering it to the instep of his shoe  when he went up to his class. Unhappily for his scheme, he was so placed  that he dared not expose his foot so as to allow him to avail himself  of this delectable assistance, and consequently, after much looking on  the floor for inspiration, and much incoherent muttering, was passed  over, and the order of things being thereby disturbed, of course no one  could say the missing lines until the head boy was applied to, and the  lower half of the class was turned down, with the exception of Louis,  who, standing on this occasion just above the gentleman of shoe memory,  had been able to say his share.    As they were breaking up, Mr. Danby said to Louis, \"You have been very  industrious lately, Louis Mortimer: I am glad you have been so correct  to-day.\"    Louis blushed from a consciousness of undeserved praise; but though  his natural fear of offending and losing favor sprung up directly, a  higher principle faced it, and bearing down all obstacles, forced him  to acknowledge his unworthiness of the present encomium.    \"I ought to learn mine, sir,--I learned my piece to-day.\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Mr. Danby.    \"I learned my part of the lesson, as well as Harris, Williams, Sutton,  and Charles Salisbury. We forgot our lessons last night, but it is quite  an accident that I have said mine to-day.\"    \"I am glad you have had the honor to say so,\" said Mr. Danby.  \"Of course you must learn yours, but let me have no more  learning pieces, if you please.\"          CHAPTER VI.      \"Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house, they will    be still praising Thee. For a day in Thy courts is    better than a thousand. I had rather be a door-keeper    in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents    of wickedness.\"--Psalm lxxxiv. 4, 10.      Dr. Wilkinson's school was too large to be entirely accommodated with  sittings in the nearest church--and, consequently, was divided into two  bodies on Sunday, one of which regularly attended one of the churches in  Bristol, where Mr. Wilkinson, the doctor's son, occasionally did duty.  It fell to Louis' lot, generally, to be of the Bristol party, and unless  the day was rainy he was not ill-pleased with his destiny, for the walk  was very pleasant, and there was something in the chorus of bells in that  many-churched city, and the sight of the gray towers and spires, very  congenial to his feelings. It happened that the Sunday after Louis had  received permission to mix as usual with his school-fellows was one  of those peculiarly sunny days that seem to call upon God's people  especially to rejoice and be glad in the Works of His hand. Louis' mind  was in a more than usually peaceful state, and his heart overflowed  with quiet happiness as he looked down from the height of Brandon Hill  upon the city below. He and his companion had walked on rather faster  than the rest of their school-fellows, and now stood waiting till they  came up.    \"A penny for your thoughts, Mortimer,\" said his companion, a  pleasant-looking boy of fifteen or sixteen years of age; \"you  are very silent to-day--what may be the subject of your profound  meditations?\"    Louis hardly seemed to hear the question, for he suddenly turned his  bright face to his interrogator, and exclaimed, \"What a beautiful sight  it is to see so many churches together, Meredith! I think our churches  make us such a happy country.\"    [Illustration: Louis and Meredith on Brandon Hill.]    \"Upon my word,\" replied Meredith, \"you are endowing those piles of  stone with considerable potency. What becomes of commerce and--\"    \"I mean, of course,\" interrupted Louis, \"that it is religion that  makes us a happier country than others. I love so to look at the  churches; the sight of one sometimes, when all is fair and quiet,  brings the tears into my eyes.\"    \"Hey-dey! quite sentimental! You'd better be a parson, I think.\"    \"I hope I shall be a clergyman--I wish very much to be one--there is  not such another happy life. I was just thinking, Meredith, when you  spoke to me, of a verse we read yesterday morning, which quite expresses  my feelings: 'One thing have I desired of the Lord which I will seek  after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,  to behold the fair beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in His temple.'\"    Meredith looked with some surprise at Louis, and as they moved on he  said carelessly, \"I suppose somebody will have the gratification of  beholding me in a long gown some day, holding forth for the edification  of my devoted flock.\"    \"Are you going to be a clergyman?\" asked Louis.    \"Yes, I suppose I must. Don't you think I shall be a most  useful character?\"    \"Oh! surely you wish it, do you not?\"    \"Well, I don't much mind,\" replied Meredith, snatching a handful of  leaves from the hedge near him; \"I shall have a nice fat living, and  it's a respectable kind of thing.\"    Louis was horror-struck--he had not imagined such an idea--he almost  gasped out, \"Oh! Meredith, I can hardly understand you. Surely that is  not your only wish about it: that cannot be a reason--not a right one.\"    \"Why, what's the harm?\" said Meredith, laughing. \"I only say outright  what hundreds think. If I could choose, perhaps I might like the army  best, but my father has a comfortable provision in the church for me,  and so I, like a dutiful son, don't demur, especially as, if I follow  the example of my predecessor, it will be vastly more easy than a  soldier's life.\"    \"Meredith, Meredith, this is too solemn a thing to laugh about. I have  often wondered how it is there are clergymen who can take their duties  so easily as some do; but if they only undertake them for your reasons,  I cannot feel so much surprised that they should be so careless. How  can you expect any happiness from such a life! I should be afraid to  talk so.\"    Meredith stared contemptuously. \"You are a Methodist, Louis,\" he said;  \"I have no doubt I shall preach as good sermons as you: just put on a  grave face, and use a set of tender phrases, and wear a brilliant on  your little finger, and a curly head, and there you are a fashionable  preacher at once--and if you use your white pocket-handkerchief  occasionally, throw your arms about a little, look as if you intended  to tumble over the pulpit and embrace the congregation, and dose your  audience with a little pathos, you may draw crowds--the ladies will  idolize you.\"    \"I should not think that such popularity would be very good,\"  replied Louis, \"supposing you could do as you say; but it seems  to me quite shocking to speak in such a slighting manner of so  holy a thing. Were you ever at an ordination, Meredith?\"    \"Not I,\" said Meredith.    \"I should think if you had been you would be afraid to think of going  to answer the solemn questions you will be asked when you are ordained.  I was once with papa at an ordination at Norwich cathedral, and I shall  never forget how solemnly that beautiful service came upon me. I could  not help thinking how dreadful it must be to come"]]]
