Then you and Ned can start off early in the morning.\"    \"All right,\" agreed Tom, but there was a thoughtful look on his face  and he appeared to be planning something that needed careful attention  to details.    After supper that night Tom took his chum to one side and asked: \"Would  you mind very much if you didn't make the trip to Shopton with me?\"    \"No, Tom, of course not, if it will help you any.  Do you want me to  stay here?\"    \"I think it will be a good plan.  I don't like to leave dad alone if  those scoundrels are around.  Of course he's able to look after  himself, but sometimes he gets absent minded from thinking too much  about his inventions.\"    \"Of course I'll stay here at the hotel.  This is just as good a  vacation as I could wish.\"    \"Oh, I don't mean all the while.  Just a day or so--until I come back.  I may be here again by to-morrow night and find that my father is  needlessly alarmed.  Then something may have happened at home and I  would be delayed.  If I should be, I'd feel better to know that you  were here.\"    \"Then I'll stay, and if I see any of those men--\"    \"You'd better steer clear of them,\" advised Tom quickly.  \"They are  dangerous customers.\"    \"All right.  Then I'll go over and give Miss Nestor lessons on how to  run a motor-boat,\" was the smiling response.  \"I fancy, with what she  and I know, we can make out pretty well.\"    \"Hold on there!\" cried Tom gaily.  \"No trespassing, you know.\"    \"Oh, I'll just say I'm your agent,\" promised Ned with a grin.  \"You  can't object to that.\"    \"No, I s'pose not.  Well, do the best you can.  She is certainly a nice  girl.\"    \"Yes, but you do seem to turn up at most opportune times.  Luck is  certainly with you where she is concerned.  First you save her in a  runaway--\"    \"After I start the runaway,\" interrupted Tom.    \"Then you take her for a ride in your motor-boat, and, lastly, you come  to her relief when she is stalled in the middle of the lake.  Oh you  certainly are a lucky dog!\"    \"Never mind, I'm giving you a show.  Now let's get to bed early, as I  want to get a good start.\"    Tom awoke to find a nasty, drizzling rainstorm in progress, and the  lake was almost hidden from view by a swirling fog.  Still he was not  to be daunted from his trip to Shopton by the weather, and, after a  substantial breakfast, he bade his father and Ned good-by and started  off in the ARROW.    The canopy he had provided was an efficient protection against the  rain, a celluloid window in the forward hanging curtains affording him  a view so that he could steer.    Through the mist puffed the boat, the motor being throttled down to  medium speed, for Tom was not as familiar with the lake as he would  like to have been, and he did not want to run aground or into another  craft.    He was thinking over what his father had told him about the presence of  the men and vainly wondering what might be their reference to the  \"sparkler.\"  His thoughts also dwelt on the curious removal of the  bracing block from under the gasoline tank of his boat.    \"I shouldn't be surprised but what Andy Foger did that,\" he mused.  \"Some day he and I will have a grand fight, and then maybe he'll let me  alone.  Well, I've got other things to think about now.  The hotel  detective can keep a lookout for the men around the hotel, after the  warning I gave him, and I'll see that all is right at home.\"    The fog lifted somewhat and Tom put on more speed.  As he was steering  the boat along near shore he heard, off to the woods at his right, the  report of a gun.  It came so suddenly that he jumped involuntarily.  A  moment later there sounded, plainly through the damp air, a cry for  help.    \"Some one's hurt--shot!\" cried the youth aloud.    He turned the boat in toward the bank.  As he shut off the power from  the motor he heard the cry again:    \"Help! Help!  Help!\"    \"I must go ashore!\" he exclaimed.  \"Probably some one is badly wounded  by a gun.\"    He paused for a moment as the fear came to him that it might be some of  the patent thieves.  Then, dismissing that idea as the ARROW's prow  touched the gravel, Tom sprang out, drew the boat up a little way,  fastened the rope to a tree and hurried off into the dripping woods in  the direction of the voice that was calling for aid.          CHAPTER XI    A QUICK RUN      \"Where are you?\"  cried Tom.  \"Are you hurt?  Where are you?\"    Uttering these words after he had hurried into the woods a short  distance, the young inventor paused for an answer.  At first he could  hear nothing but the drip of water from the branches of the trees;  then, as he listened intently, he became aware of a groan not far away.    \"Where are you?\"  cried the lad again.  \"I've come to help you.  Where  are you?\"    He had lost what little fear he had had at first, that it might be one  of the unscrupulous gang, and came to the conclusion that he might  safely offer to help.    Once more the groan sounded and it was followed by a faint voice  speaking:    \"Here I am, under the big oak tree.  Oh, whoever you are, help me  quickly!  I'm bleeding to death!\"    With the sound of the voice to guide him, Tom swung around.  The appeal  had come from the left and, looking in that direction, he saw, through  the mist, a large oak tree.  Leaping over the underbrush toward it he  caught sight of the wounded man at its foot.  Beside him lay a gun and  there was a wound in the man's right arm.    \"Who shot you?\"  cried Tom, hurrying to the side of the man.  \"Was it  some of those patent thieves?\"  Then, realizing that a stranger would  know nothing of the men who had stolen the model, Tom prepared to  change the form of his question.  But, before he had an opportunity to  do this, the man, whose eyes were closed, opened them, and, as he got a  better sight of his face, Tom uttered a cry.    \"Why, it's Mr. Duncan!\"  exclaimed the lad.  He had recognized the rich  hunter, whom he had first met in the woods that spring shortly after  Happy Harry, the tramp, had disabled Tom's motor-cycle.  \"Mr. Duncan,\"  the young inventor repeated, \"how did you get shot?\"    \"Is that you, Tom Swift?\"  asked the gunner.  \"Help me, please.  I must  stop this bleeding in my arm.  I'll tell you about it afterward.  Wind  something around it tight--your handkerchief will do.\"    The man sighed weakly and his eyes closed again.  The lad saw the blood  spurting from an ugly wound.    \"I must make a tourniquet,\" the youth exclaimed.  \"That will check the  bleeding until I can get him to a doctor.\"    With Tom to think was to act.  He took out his knife and cut off Mr.  Duncan's sleeves below the injury, slashing through coat and shirts.  Then he saw that part of a charge of shot had torn away some of the  large muscular development of the upper arm.  The hunter seemed to have  fainted and the youth worked quickly.  Tying his handkerchief above the  wound and inserting a small stone under the cloth, so that the pebble  would press on the main artery, Tom put a stick in the handkerchief and  began to twist it.  This had the effect of tightening the linen around  the arm, and in a few seconds the lad was glad to see that the blood  had stopped spurting out with every beat of the heart.  Giving the  tourniquet a few more twists to completely stop the flow of blood, Tom  fastened the stick-lever in place by a bit of string.    \"That's--that's better,\" murmured Mr. Duncan.  \"Now if you can go for a  doctor--\"  He had to pause for breath.    \"I'll not leave you here alone while I go for a doctor,\" declared Tom.  \"I have my motor-boat on the lake.  Do you think I could get you down  to it and take you home?\"    \"Perhaps--maybe.  I'll be stronger in a moment, now that the bleeding  has stopped.  But not--not home--frighten my wife.  Take me to the  sanitarium if you can--sanitarium up the lake, a few miles from here.\"    The unfortunate man, who had tried to sit upright, had to lean back  against the tree again.  Tom understood what he meant in spite of the  broken sentences.  Mr. Duncan did not want to be taken home in the  condition he was then in, for fear of alarming his wife.  He wanted to  be taken to the sanitarium, and Tom knew where this was, a well-known  resort for the treatment of various diseases and surgical cases.  It  was about five miles away and on the opposite shore of the lake.    \"Water--a drink!\"  murmured Mr. Duncan.    Seeing that his patient would be all right, for a few minutes at least,  Tom hurried to his motor-boat, got a cup and, filling it with water  from a jug he carried, he hastened with it to the hunter.  The fluid  revived the man wonderfully and now that the bleeding had almost  completely stopped, Mr. Duncan was much stronger.    \"Do you think you can get to the boat, if I help you?\"  asked Tom.    \"Yes, I believe so.  To think of meeting you again, and under such  circumstances!  It is providential.\"    \"Did someone shoot you?\"  inquired Tom, who could not get out of his  head the notion of the men who had once assaulted him.    \"No, I shot myself,\" answered Mr. Duncan as he got to his feet with  Tom's help.  \"I was out with my gun, practicing just as I was that day  when I met you in the woods.  I stooped down to crawl under a bush and  the weapon went off, the muzzle being close against my arm.  I can't  understand how it happened.  I fell down and called for help.  Then I  guess I must have fainted, but I came to when I heard you talking to  me.  I shouldn't have come out to-day as it is so wet, but I had some  new shot shells I wished to try in order to test them before the  hunting season.  But if I can get to the sanitarium, I will be well  taken care of.  I know one of the doctors there.\"    With Tom leading him and acting as a sort of support, the journey to  the motor-boat was slowly made.  Making as comfortable a bed as  possible out of the seat cushions, Tom assisted Mr. Duncan to it, and  then starting the engine he sent "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22748"],[0,"Explanation of Terms Used in Entomology (#11)"],[1,"is enlarged as in bees.
