[Illustration]    \"How could I have been so cruel and ungrateful,\" she cried. \"I promised  faithfully that I would return at the end of the week. What will he  think of me for breaking my promise!\"    Hastily rising from bed, she searched for the ring the Beast had given  her. Then putting it on her little finger she wished to be at the Palace  of the Beast again. In a moment she found herself there; and quickly  putting on her clothes she hurried out to look for the Beast. She  searched through room after room; but nowhere could she find him. At  last she ran out into the garden; and there, on a plot of grass, where  he and she had often sat together, she found him lying as if dead upon  the ground.    With a bitter cry she sank on her knees beside the poor Beast.    \"Oh, Beast; my dear, dear Beast!\" she cried. \"How could I have been so  cruel and wicked and unkind? He has died of sorrow as he said he would!\"  And the tears fell down from her eyes as she spoke. Overcome with grief  and remorse, she stooped down and tenderly kissed the ugly Beast.    In a moment there was a sudden noise, and Beauty was startled to find  that the ugly Beast had vanished. The Beast was a beast no longer, but a  handsome Prince, who knelt at her feet, thanking her for having broken  his enchantment.    \"A wicked fairy,\" he said, \"condemned me to keep the form of a beast  until a beautiful maiden should forget my ugliness and kiss me. You, by  your love and tenderness, have broken the spell and released me from my  horrible disguise. Now, thanks to you, I can take my proper form again.\"  And then he begged Beauty to become his bride.    So Beauty married the Prince who had been a Beast, and they lived  together in the castle and ruled over the Prince's country, and were  happy ever after.    [Illustration]          THE STORY OF CINDERELLA    [Illustration]      There was once a rich man, whose wife died, leaving him with one little  girl. After some years, hoping to give his child a mother's love and  care, he married again, this time a widow, with two grown-up daughters.  But his second wife was haughty and proud, and her two daughters were  even worse than their mother; and the poor little girl had a very  unhappy time with her new relations. Her stepsisters were jealous of  her, for she was very beautiful, and they themselves were plain and  ugly. They did all they could to make her miserable; and, at length,  through their wicked spite and envy, her life became a burden to her.  The poor child was sent to live in the kitchen, where she had to do all  the rough and dirty work; and because she was always dressed in rags,  and sat beside the cinders in the grate, they called her Cinderella.    It happened that the King of the country had an only son. He was very  anxious that the Prince should be married; so he gave a great ball, and  invited all the grand ladies in the country to come to it. It was to be  a very splendid affair, lasting for three nights, and people were very  eager to be invited to it, for it was known that the Prince would choose  his bride from among the ladies present.    Cinderella's sisters received invitations; and from the day they arrived  they talked of nothing but of what they should wear, for each of them  secretly hoped that she would be chosen as the Prince's bride.    When the great day came at last, they began to dress for the ball  directly after breakfast. Cinderella had to help them; and they kept  her busy all day doing their hair, and running messages, and helping  them to lace up their fine dresses.    When Cinderella saw their beautiful clothes she wished that she could  go to the ball as well; but when she timidly asked if she might, they  laughed in mocking scorn.    \"You go to the ball!\" they cried. \"What would you do at the ball, with  your rags and tatters and your dirty face? No, no, Cinderella, go back  to your seat amongst the ashes--that is the place for a little kitchen  girl like you!\"    So the two sisters and their mother drove away in a carriage and pair to  the King's palace, and Cinderella was left behind. She sat down on the  hearth before the kitchen fire and began to cry softly to herself,  because she felt so very lonely and miserable.    As she sat there in the dusk, with the firelight dancing over her, and  her face buried in her hands, she heard a voice calling:    \"Cinderella, Cinderella!\" and with a start she looked up to see who it  could be.    There on the hearth in front of her stood an old woman, leaning upon a  stick. She was dressed in a long red cloak, and she wore high-heeled  shoes and a tall black hat.    [Illustration]    Where she had come from Cinderella could not imagine. She certainly had  not come in through the door, nor yet through the window for both were  shut.    Cinderella was so surprised to see her that she stopped crying, and  stared at her in astonishment.    \"What are you crying for?\" asked the old woman.    \"Because my mother and sisters have gone to the ball, and I am left here  all alone,\" said Cinderella.    \"Do you want to go to the ball, too!\" said the old lady.    \"Yes, but it is no good; I have nothing but rags to wear,\" sobbed poor  Cinderella.    \"Well, well, be a good child and don't cry any more,\" said the old  woman, briskly. \"I am your Fairy Godmother, and if you do what I tell  you, perhaps you shall go after all. Run out into the garden and bring  me in a pumpkin!\"    Cinderella ran out into the garden and brought in the biggest pumpkin  that she could find.    \"Now go and fetch the mouse-trap out of the cellar,\" said her Godmother,  and Cinderella hurried to get it. There were six mice in the trap, and  the old woman harnessed them to the pumpkin, put a rat on the top to  drive them, and two lizards behind, and then waved her wand over them.  Immediately the pumpkin turned into a gorgeous coach, the mice into six  beautiful horses, the rat into a stately coachman, and the lizards into  tall footmen, with powdered hair and silk stockings. \"There,\" said the  old woman; \"there's a carriage to take you to the ball.\"    [Illustration]    \"Alas,\" said Cinderella, \"how can I go to the ball? I have nothing to  wear but this!\" and she touched her ragged frock.    \"Is that all?\" said the Fairy Godmother. Once more she waved her wand,  and Cinderella's rags turned into the most beautiful dress in the world,  all shining with gold and silver threads and covered with costly gems.  In her hair was a circlet of pearls, and her feet were shod with the  prettiest and daintiest pair of glass slippers that ever were seen.    \"Now,\" said the Fairy Godmother, \"now you can go to the ball. But mind  you come away before the clock strikes twelve, for should you linger  beyond that hour, all your splendor will vanish, and your dress will  turn into rags again.\"    Cinderella promised to obey her Godmother's instructions. Then she got  into the beautiful coach. The footman shut the door, the coachman  whipped up the horses, and away she went to the ball.    When she arrived there was a great stir in the Palace. So lovely a face  and so costly and rich a dress had never before been seen, and everybody  thought it must be some great Princess arrived from foreign lands.    [Illustration]    All the courtiers and other guests stood back to let her pass, and when  the Prince caught sight of her he fell in love with her on the spot. He  danced with her the whole of the evening, and people thought there was  no doubt as to whom he would choose for his bride.    At a quarter to twelve, Cinderella, remembering her Godmother's  instructions, said good-bye to the Prince and came away.    She arrived home just as the clock struck twelve. At once the coachman  and footmen turned back into rats and mice, and the coach into a  pumpkin; and when the sisters came home a little later, there was  Cinderella, dressed in her old shabby frock, sitting in her usual place  amongst the cinders.    The two ugly sisters were full of the strange Princess who had come to  the ball. They talked about her all the next day, little dreaming that  all the while the beautiful lady was their despised sister Cinderella.    In the evening after they had gone again to the ball, the Fairy  Godmother made her appearance. Once more Cinderella drove to the Palace  in her coach and six; this time arrayed in a still more gorgeous and  beautiful dress; and once more the Prince danced with her all the  evening.    [Illustration]    But when the third night came Cinderella was enjoying herself so much  that she quite forgot what her Fairy Godmother had said, until suddenly  she heard the clock begin to strike twelve. She remembered that as soon  as it finished striking, all her fine clothes would turn to rags again;  and, jumping up in alarm, she ran out of the room. The Prince ran after  her, trying to overtake her; and Cinderella in her fright ran so fast  that she left one of her little glass slippers on the floor behind her.    The Prince stopped to pick it up, and this gave Cinderella time to  escape; but she was only just in time. Just as she was crossing the  Palace yard, the clock finished striking, and immediately all her finery  vanished; and there she was, dressed in her old ragged frock again.    When the Prince came out upon the Palace steps, he could see no sign of  the lovely Princess. The guards at the gate told him that nobody at all  had passed that way, except a little ragged kitchenmaid; and the Prince  had to go back to the ball with only a little glass slipper to remind  him of the beautiful lady with whom he was so desperately in love.    The next day the King sent out all his heralds and trumpeters with a  Proclamation, saying that the Prince would marry the lady whose foot  the slipper fitted. But though all the ladies in the land tried on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20750"],[0,"Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society - Vol. 3 (#11)"],[1,"examining the Nautilus in the fresh state has not noted  any difference of structure in the two sets of follicles.    One is naturally led to seek among other mollusks for a structure  analogous to the vast posterior aquiferous chamber of the Nautilus; and  it appears to me that something quite similar is offered by the  _Ascidioida_ and the _Brachiopoda_. In both cases, the viscera, inclosed  within a delicate tissue, project into a large cavity communicating  freely with the exterior by the cloacal aperture in the one case, and  by the funnel-shaped channels which have been miscalled \"hearts\" in the  other.    The rudimentary renal organs of the Ascidian are developed in the walls  of the cavity in question; and an aquiferous chamber of smaller  dimensions has the same relation to the kidney in Lamellibranchiata--in  Gasteropoda, Heteropoda, Pteropoda, and dibranchiate Cephalopoda. But  although such is likely enough to be the case, we do not know at present  that the aquiferous chambers in any of the last named mollusks attain an  extension similar to that which obtains in Nautilus.    On comparing the observations detailed above with the statements of  previous writers, I find that, in his well-known \"Memoir on the Pearly  Nautilus\" (1832), Professor Owen describes \"on each side, at the roots  of the branchiae,\" \"a small mamillary eminence with a transverse slit  which conducts from the branchial cavity into the pericardium. There is,  moreover, a foramen at the lower part of the cavity (_o_, pl. 5)  permitting the escape of a small vessel; and by the side of this vessel  a free passage is continued between the gizzard and ovary into the  membranous tube or siphon that traverses the divisions of the shell,  thus establishing a communication between the interior of that tube and  the exterior of the animal.\"    The foramen here described is easily seen; but, as I have stated, there  are other modes of communication between the so-called pericardium and  the cavity with which the siphuncle communicates, of a far more  extensive nature.    With respect to the pericardium itself, Professor Owen states, \"The  peritoneum, after lining the cavity which contains the crop and liver,  and enveloping those viscera, forms two distinct pouches at the bottom  of the pallial sac, in one of which, the left, is contained the gizzard,  and in the other the ovary; anterior to these, and on the ventral aspect  of the liver, is another distinct cavity, of a square shape, which  contains the heart and principal vessels, with the glandular appendages  connected therewith.\" This is what the author terms the pericardium.    As Van der Hoeven has pointed out, however, the gizzard lies to the  right and the ovary to the left. Moreover, the gizzard is superior to  the ovary, so as only to overlap it a little above; and I can find no  evidence of the existence of such distinct pouches as those described.    Professor Owen states that the branchiae \"arise by a common peduncle from  the inner surface of the mantle.\" My own observations, however, and Van  der Hoeven's figures, of both male and female, lead me to believe that  the peduncles of the branchiae are perfectly distinct from one another.    The follicles of the branchial arteries are thus described in the  \"Memoir on the Pearly Nautilus:\"--\"They are short and pyriform and  closely set together. To each of the branchial arteries are appended  three clusters of these glands, of which one is larger than the united  volume of both the others; and the larger cluster is situated on one  side of the vessel and the two smaller on the opposite side. Each of  these clusters is contained in a membranous receptacle proper to itself,  partitioned off, as it were, from the pericardium, but communicating  with it.... The two canals which form the communication between the  pericardium and the branchial cavity commence at the receptacle of the  lesser cluster attached to the superior branchial arteries, and  terminate at the papillae before mentioned, which are situated at the  roots of the branchiae. The pericardium and these receptacles of the  glands, when first laid open, were found filled with a coagulated  substance so closely compacted as to require a careful removal, bit by  bit, before the contained follicles and vessels could be brought into  view.\"    Like Valenciennes and Van der Hoeven, I have been unable to find any  communication between the four sacs in which the small double clusters  of follicles are contained, and the \"pericardium;\" and I hold it to be  certain that the other four sets of follicles are not contained in sacs  at all, but lie free in the \"pericardium\" or posterior chamber.    No notice is here taken of the widely different characters of the  anterior and posterior follicles; and the figure gives both a similar  structure.    Valenciennes (\"Nouvelles Recherches sur le Nautile Flambe,\" 'Archives du  Museum,' ii., 1841) pointed out the existence of three pairs of  apertures opening into the branchial sac, besides the genital and anal  openings; and he affirms that they open into as many closed sacs, which  communicate neither with one another nor with the cavity that contains  the heart. M. Valenciennes indicates the difference in the structure of  the anterior and posterior venous appendages. He seems to me to have  seen something of the part which I have described as the pallio-visceral  ligament; but I cannot clearly comprehend either his figure or his  description.    Van der Hoeven, in his 'Contributions to the Knowledge of the Animal of  _Nautilus pompilius_,' 1850, confirmed the statement of Valenciennes  with regard to the existence of three pairs of apertures; but he showed,  in opposition to him, that one of these pairs of apertures communicated  with the pericardium. The sacs into which the other two pairs open are,  according to this anatomist, blind. In the aperture of the anterior  blind sac he found a concretionary matter which he supposed to contain  uric acid, but chemical analysis did not confirm the supposition. Van  der Hoeven refers to some observations by Vrolik; but as these are in  Dutch, and have not, so far as I can find, been translated into either  French, German, or English, I know not what they may contain.    In his more recent essay, translated in 'Wiegmann's Archiv' for 1857,  under the title of \"Beitrag zur Anatomie von _Nautilus pompilius_,\" Van  der Hoeven states that he has again found hard concretions in the  chamber enclosing the appendage of the anterior branchial artery, and  that these on chemical analysis yielded phosphate of lime and traces of  fat and albumen, but no uric acid.    Mr. Macdonald, in a valuable paper on the anatomy of _Nautilus  umbilicatus_, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1855, thus  describes the follicular appendages of the branchial arteries:--    \"These follicles are subcylindrical in form, somewhat dilated at the  free extremity, to which is appended a folded and funnel-shaped process  of membrane, which expands rather suddenly, presenting a jagged and  irregular border. They open by a smooth and oval or slit-like, orifice  into the afferent pulmonary vessels, on each of which, as Professor Owen  has observed, they are disposed in three clusters. The outer membrane is  smooth and glassy, homogeneous in structure and sprinkled over with  minute rounded and transparent bodies, probably the nuclei of cells.  Beneath this layer, flat bundles of fibres, apparently muscular, are  traceable here and there, principally disposed in a longitudinal  direction, and sometimes branched. The lining membrane consists of a  loose epithelial pavement in many respects similar to that of the  uriniferous tubules of the higher animals, the cells containing, besides  the nuclei, numerous minute oil-globules, or a substance much resembling  concrete fatty matter. This membrane is thrown up into an infinite  number of papillae and corrugations, so as to augment the extent of  surface considerably. The papillae are more numerous at the inner part or  towards the attached end; and a circlet of longitudinally disposed folds  radiate from the bottom of the follicles, in which a number of small  pits or fenestrations are sometimes visible. The sides of these folds  are wrinkled transversely so as to present a median zigzag elevation.  The funnel-shaped membranous process above noticed is continuous with  the lining membrane, consisting of an extension of the same epithelial  pavement; but the cells are somewhat larger and more regular in form.  The cavity of each follicle, therefore, communicates with the exterior  through the centre of this process; and the aperture is thus guarded by  a kind of circular valve, permitting the escape of secreted matter, but  effectually preventing the entrance of fluid from without.\"    In his fig. 9, pl. xv., Mr. Macdonald depicts certain \"crystalline  bodies often occurring within the follicles.\"    From what Mr. Macdonald states, one would be led to conclude that all  the follicles have the same structure; but I suspect this to be an  oversight.
