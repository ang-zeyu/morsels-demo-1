So he did not conceive of his west front as a flat space to be  ornamented, but as a wall to be built, and naturally his ornament  followed and emphasised the main lines of his building. His single  pillars, with their heavy capitals, bore witness that they were made of  great stones piled one on the top of the other; his simple windows were  merely openings in the wall to let in light.    [Illustration: The Exterior, from the South-East.]    But as masons grew more skilful, and designers more sophisticated, they  found it pleasant to play with their material; to turn their single  pillars into bundles of clustered shafts; to fill their windows with  tracery, structural at first, but afterwards as free and fantastic as  lacework. The result is often beautiful. The method gave the freest play  to the artist's invention, but it had its dangers, and they are  exemplified at York. There the designer has evidently regarded his west  front as a large space of wall to be played with, to be decorated much  as if it were a piece of embroidery, and, in his anxiety to decorate it  richly, he has lost his sense of unity and proportion. He has forgotten  to use his ornament merely to emphasise the main lines of the structure.  Where this is done, where the ornament is massed on the porches, on the  windows, and on the lines dividing the storeys, the rest of the facade  may be left alone. The bare spaces of masonry only serve to give relief  to the decoration. But at York the main lines are so neglected, they  offer so little opportunity for decoration, that the designer was afraid  to leave his walls plain, lest the whole should appear lean and cold. He  has, therefore, spun his tracery and panelling over the whole surface.  Nowhere can the eye rest on a plain piece of wall; everywhere it is  fidgeted by monotonous rows of niches and mouldings. In fact, it may be  compared to an etching so full of unnecessary details that composition,  balance of mass, and beauty of line are all smothered in them. And yet  there is much to be said on the other side. The mere size--the height  and width--go far to make the front impressive; and the detail, even now  when so much of it has been restored, is usually beautiful. If it is not  great architecture, it is at least living architecture, and as such  infinitely superior to the most scholarly works of the Gothic revival.  It is only when we compare it to the magnificent west fronts of France  that we are inclined to regret that it has not rivalled them.    #The North Side# of the exterior of the nave differs from the south in  several particulars. Thus, on the south the aisle buttresses are crowned  by lofty pinnacles having at their bases niches, in some of which  statues still remain. These pinnacles appear to have been originally  connected with the wall of the nave by flying buttresses, traces of  which still exist, both on the walls and the pinnacles. In Hollar's  engraving, in a later print in Dugdale's \"Monasticon\" (1817), and in  Willis's \"Cathedrals\" (1742), these buttresses are represented as  existing, but the accuracy of the pictures in these books cannot be  trusted. It is possible that a beginning only was made of these flying  buttresses, and that when it was decided to place a wooden vault on the  cathedral, they were discontinued as being unnecessary. At any rate,  there are no pinnacles to the aisle buttresses on the north side, and,  consequently, no flying buttresses. The plainer style of the north side  was perhaps owing to the fact that a great part of it was concealed by  the archbishop's palace, yet at the present day it is certainly more  beautiful than the south. It closely resembles the exterior of the  beautiful nave of Beverley Minster, and for simplicity and delicacy of  design could hardly be surpassed. The bays are marked by plain aisle  buttresses, terminating in three-cornered caps, with a battlement of  cusped stonework ornamented with finials behind them. The buttresses of  the nave are plain narrow bands of stone topped with small pinnacles.  The roof is low pitched; the only other decoration is given by the  uniform tracery of the windows and by a crocketed gable above each of  the windows of the aisle.    #North Transept.#--The walls of the north transept are lower than those  of the nave, and its roof, covered with a particularly ugly coating of  zinc, is much more highly pitched. Thus the ridges of the two roofs are  practically level, while the battlement of the transept is only on a  level with the point at which the arches of the clerestory in the nave  spring. The union of the two and the contrast between the low-pitched  roof of the nave and the stilted roofs of the transept are rather  awkward. It should be said that the zinc roof of the north transept was  a necessity, as the old roof of stone tiles proved to be too heavy. But  for these inevitable differences the exterior of the north transept  blends most successfully with that of the nave, though, of course, its  details are altogether different. As an example of the great effect to  be attained by the lancet windows, delicate proportions, and restrained  ornament of the Early English style, it has never been surpassed. It  extends three bays from the nave. The aisle buttresses end some little  way below the battlements of the aisle. There are no buttresses against  the main wall of the transept; but it is ornamented with a row of  arches, some blank, and some pierced with the clerestory windows. These  windows are in groups of three separated by two blank arches. The blank  arches are wider than the windows. All the arches are decorated with  dog-tooth mouldings. The absence of buttresses and the continuous row of  arches cause a remarkable freedom from vertical lines in the exterior of  the transepts, which is also characteristic of the interior. The  battlements, both of the aisles and of the transept itself, are quite  plain. The most admirable portion of this transept is its north front,  which contains the famous group of lancet windows known as the \"five  sisters.\" These are five very narrow and long windows separated only by  slender shafts. Below them is a blind arcade almost entirely without  ornament, and above them another group of five lancet windows of  different sizes, gradually diminishing from the central window to follow  the outline of the gable. The details of these upper windows closely  resemble those of the \"five sisters,\" and they are flanked by two blind  arches. The buttresses are also ornamented with blind arches, and appear  never to have been finished, as they are truncated in an unusual way  where one would expect pinnacles. The exterior of the western aisle of  this transept is very curious in arrangement. There is an almost  complete absence of division into bays. There are two lancet windows to  each bay, and buttresses rise between them as well as between the bays.  Thus there is nothing to mark the interior division of the main arches,  clerestory, and triforium. All of these buttresses are cut short by caps  a little way below the tops of the windows. Between the groups of aisle  windows are blind arches narrower than the windows themselves. There is  a blind arch of the same width at the southern extremity, and a wider  one at the northern. The aisles, like the rest of the transept, are  almost perfectly plain.    [Illustration: The Exterior, from the North.]    The #Chapter-house# is connected with the eastern aisle of the transept  by a vestibule projecting three bays beyond the north front. This  vestibule then turns eastward for two bays, at which point it joins the  chapter-house. Both vestibule and chapter-house are magnificent examples  of Decorated work. Their date is doubtful, and is discussed in the  history of the building. They are certainly among the finest works of  Gothic architecture in Europe. The chapter-house is octagonal in shape,  and is crowned by a lofty pyramidal roof. Its chief, almost its only  decoration, is provided by the buttresses and the beautiful tracery of  the acutely-pointed windows. The buttresses are of very curious design.  They are joined to the wall of the chapter-house for nearly half their  height, and up to this point are quite plain. They are then narrowed  into lofty pinnacles, and these pinnacles are connected with the wall by  two small flying buttresses, the lower one plainly moulded and sloping  upwards to the wall, the upper one being horizontal and richly decorated  with arcading, two arcades to each side of every buttress. At the point  at which the buttress narrows into the pinnacle there are cusped gables  with gargoyles on the outer side of the buttresses. The pinnacles are  decorated with slender shafts and richly ornamented gables. The windows  of the chapter-house contain five lights. They will be further described  in the account of the interior of the building. Above them is a plain  battlement, with two rows of ornament below it, and three figures in  each bay above it. There is a very curious buttress at the point of  junction of the vestibule and the chapter-house. It is joined to the  wall of the chapter-house up to the battlement, and consists of an  irregular mass of masonry ornamented as far as possible in the same  manner as the other buttresses with gables and panelling. The two bays  of the vestibule nearest to the chapter-house have nothing unusual about  them except their buttresses. One of these is set close to the wall up  to the spire of the pinnacle. All the other buttresses of the vestibule,  except the one built against the buttress of the transept end, have  pinnacles joined to the wall by a pierced arch of curious and ingenious  design. The vestibule is crowned by plain battlements like that of the  chapter-house, with small square-headed windows of two lights each.

Of course you  cannot expect to go hiking off over these rough trails; but you can  certainly get out of bed and move about the camp.\"    Theo's eyes sparkled.    \"My, but won't it seem good!\" he sighed.    \"I am sure it will,\" answered the Doctor. \"You have been very  patient, Theo.\"    \"Going to get the invalid up, Doctor?\" questioned Mr. Croyden, who had  just poked his head in at the door.    \"Yes, just as soon as the crutches I have ordered from New York  arrive.\"    Mr. Croyden looked rueful.    \"That means I shall be losing my lecture audience,\" he mourned  playfully. \"You will no longer be a spoiled child, Theo, after those  crutches come. We shan't serve all your meals in your room, nor give  you the biggest fish in the catch. You will have to come down to  common fare like the rest of us.\"    \"You won't find me doing any fussing on that score,\" laughed Theo. \"As  for the lectures--why, I have a season ticket, and shall expect a  lecture every day.\"    \"Mercy on us!\" gasped Mr. Croyden. \"Do you realize, young man, that I  came into these woods to rest? If I am to make pottery and porcelain  with you every day I might just as well be at home.\"    Nevertheless it was plain that the elder man was pleased.    \"Well, so long as you have secured a season ticket in advance I  suppose there is no help for it,\" he added with a comic expression of  resignation. \"When, by the by, does the next lecture come?\"    Theo pretended to produce an imaginary ticket from his pocket and  consult it.    \"The next lecture seems to be listed for this evening just after  dinner,\" he replied gravely.    \"It does, does it!\" exclaimed Mr. Croyden. \"Very well; the lecturer  will be ready at seven sharp. I make it a point never to disappoint an  audience.\"    With a good-natured laugh he was gone.    \"I hope I don't bother Mr. Croyden too much, Father,\" observed Theo  reflectively, after the older man was out of hearing.    \"I guess you don't,\" answered the Doctor. \"At first I was afraid you  might be taking too much of his time, so I asked him; but I soon found  he enjoyed these talks quite as much as you. He is a good talker, and  like the rest of us finds it pleasant to discuss his hobby. I begged  him to be frank and tell you whenever he was too tired or busy to  talk, and he promised he would.\"    \"He has been mighty good to me.\"    \"He certainly has,\" agreed Dr. Swift. \"He likes boys very much. It is  a pity he has no son of his own.\"    \"It is a shame!\" exclaimed Theo. \"He would make such a splendid father  for some boy.\"    Dr. Swift nodded.    \"Boys are of course a great nuisance, and they make us lots of  trouble,\" he remarked dryly, \"but they are good things to have in the  house in spite of that.\"    As he rose to go he cast a whimsical glance at his son.    \"I'll leave you this book to read,\" he said. \"Mother sent it. And  here are some letters. Here, too, is a picture puzzle which looks as  if it might keep you busy for some time. I guess you won't be idle  before I get back.\"    Theo met his eye with a bright smile.    \"I guess I won't have a chance to be,\" he replied.    The book proved to be an aeroplane story of just the kind Theo liked;  and the puzzle was so hard that he worked on it at intervals most of  the day. Then came twilight and with it a game of cribbage with his  father, after which he had a deliciously cooked dinner of fried perch,  browned potatoes, and a marvelous three-story chocolate pie, a  masterpiece of Franz's cookery.    \"I think this has been about the best day yet,\" Theo remarked when  promptly at seven Mr. Croyden drew his chair up into the firelight.  \"Father does plan such jolly things for me to do! And you, and Manuel,  and Franz are so kind!\"    \"Those of us who have our legs ought to be, that's sure,\" was  Mr. Croyden's grim response. \"It is the least we can do. In my  opinion you have been a real hero, Theo. If my leg had been broken I  should never have been so patient. You would have seen me storming  round like a caged tiger. In fact I doubt even if lectures delivered  by such a brilliant speaker as myself would have kept me still.\"    Theo chuckled.    \"What is the subject of the lecture you are to give this evening?\" he  inquired with mock seriousness.    \"Wasn't it printed on your ticket?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"No?\" exclaimed Mr. Croyden in surprise. \"A great oversight! The man  who printed these tickets is a stupid fellow. I believe I shall have  to discharge him and try somebody else. The subject of this evening's  lecture is, of course, _Porcelain_.\"    \"Porcelain! Have we really come to porcelain at last!\" cried Theo,  much delighted.    \"Yes, we have now finished with the potteries and earthenwares--at  least for the present, and we shall begin on porcelain, the great  art-work of the Chinese.\"    Mr. Croyden stopped to cram tobacco into his pipe.    \"Already I have told you that the Chinese made beautiful porcelains  from kaolin and petuntse, two clays which produced a hard,  semi-transparent china,\" he began. \"And I have also told you how for a  long time they were the only nation to have a knowledge of the  necessary ingredients for such a ware. I only wish I had here at this  moment some specimens of the exquisite porcelains they have made that  you might see them and get some idea of their richness and beauty. It  is difficult to describe them in words.\"    \"Maybe when we go home Father will take me to the Metropolitan Museum  to see some Chinese porcelains,\" suggested Theo.    \"I am sure he will,\" Mr. Croyden said. \"And if he is too busy to do  it, I will take you myself. Maybe some day we could go china-hunting  together.\"    \"That would be corking!\"    \"I'd enjoy it as much as you,\" affirmed Mr. Croyden. \"We would prowl  around among the different collections and look for the celebrated  Nankin blue which, although not strictly speaking a porcelain,  would give you a glimpse of some of the finest work ever done in a  blue and white ware. Of the very early Chinese porcelains we should,  alas, find no specimens, because most of these were destroyed during  the wars that raged against the various ancient dynasties; but we  should see some examples of what is called the Chrysanthemo-Paeonienne  period.\"    \"Jove, what a name!\"    \"Not such a terrible one when you think about it,\" returned  Mr. Croyden. \"Get to work with your brain and you can soon tell me  what it means.\"    \"Chrysanthe----\" ruminated Theo, thinking aloud. \"Has it anything to  do with chrysanthemum?\"    \"It surely has. Go on,\" urged the elder man encouragingly.    \"Paeonienne--I'll bet it is another flower! Peony?\"    \"There you have it!\" came triumphantly from the china  manufacturer. \"It was not half as bad as it sounded, you  see. Chrysanthemums and peonies--the two flowers almost exclusively  used as decoration on the porcelain of that particular period. So  universally was one or the other of these flowers employed, and so  individual was their treatment, that the name serves to cover one of  the oldest types of Chinese porcelain remaining to us. This porcelain  was not so beautiful, however, as some of that which follows it; the  clay or body of the ware being less fine. One can easily see that at  that time the Chinese had not perfected their art. Nevertheless it is  remarkable, and the flower designs on it most artistic.\"    \"And what came next?\" inquired Theo.    \"Next we come to some other varieties of porcelains which connoisseurs  have grouped together because of their color and called  _Famille-vert_. Think out what that name means as you did the  other. You have studied French at school, haven't you?\"    \"A little,\" replied Theo modestly. \"_Famille_ is family; and I think  _vert_ is green. But of course it could not mean Green Family.\"    \"That is precisely what it does mean,\" Mr. Croyden returned  heartily. \"The name refers to the delicate color of the ware. 'Sky  after a summer rain' was what the Chinese sometimes poetically called  it. It is a porcelain of wonderful rarity and beauty. Some of it even  ranges to as deep hue as apple-green. One does not find much of it  now, for it is a very choice and expensive variety; nor was it widely  made. The ware for which the Chinese were most celebrated was the  _Famille-rose_.\"    \"Rose Family!\" exclaimed Theo, instantly.    \"Yes. Broadly speaking the Red Family. I am glad to see you have your  French so at your tongue's end. This porcelain of the Rose Family was  the masterpiece of the Chinese. The word rose did not in this case  refer to the flower but to the rich red tone of the porcelain. Some of  it is as deep and almost as brilliant as a ruby; and neither its  decoration nor its coloring can be surpassed. For the Chinese, you  must not forget, were the most original and unhampered of artists.  They were never content to copy flowers, faces, or figures as we do  to-day. Instead they aimed to catch the spirit of the object from  which they were working, and then with freedom and boldness to execute  a design that should have something more than mere reproduction in  it. It did not matter in the least to them if a flower in one of their  pictures was sometimes larger than a man; or a boat many sizes bigger  than the bridge beneath which it sailed. They were making a sort of  fairyland decoration where anything they pleased was possible; it was  not a world of fact. As a result they got an imaginative quality in  their decoration which none of our more prosaic and literal western  nations have ever equaled.\"    Mr. Croyden took a pull at his pipe.    \"Much of their design was symbolic, and much of the coloring they used  had a national significance. For example, the Dragon was a symbol of  empire and power; the Dog, a sacred animal, was often used; but it was  no ordinary dog. Instead it had great teeth, a curling "]]]
