[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22718"],[0,"Cathedrals and Cloisters of the South of France, Volume 1 (#11)"],[1,"the siege of 1486, is recalled only by a few weed-covered  stumps and bits of wall, and its title was given to Notre-Dame in the  lower part of the town.    No Cathedral is a sadder example of architectural failure than  Notre-Dame of Forcalquier because it has so many of the beginnings of  real beauty and dignity, so many parts of real worthiness that have been  unfortunately combined in a confused and discordant whole. If, of all  little cities of Provence, Forcalquier is one of the least unique and  least holding, its Cathedral is also one of the least satisfying. It is  not beautiful in situation nor in its own essential harmony, and the  fine but tantalising perspectives of its interior may be found again in  happier churches.    The exterior shows to a superlative degree that general tendency of  Provencal exteriors to be without definite or logical proportions. A  large, square tower, heavier than that of Grasse, served as a lookout, a  tall, thin little turret served as a belfry. In the facade there is a  Gothic portal which notwithstanding its entire mediocrity is the chief  adornment of the outer walls. They are irregular and uncouth to a degree  and their only interesting features are at the eastern end. Here the  smaller, older apses on either side betray the church's early origin.  The central apse, evidently of the same dimensions as the Romanesque one  originally designed, was re-built in severe, rudimentary Gothic. Looking  at this shallow apse alone, and following its plain lines until they  meet those of the big tower, there is a straight simplicity that is  almost fine,--but this is one mere detail in a large and barren whole,  and the Cathedral-seeker turns to the nearest entrance.    [Illustration: \"A LARGE, SQUARE TOWER SERVED AS A  LOOKOUT.\"--FORCALQUIER.]    [Illustration: \"A SUGGESTIVE VIEW FROM THE SIDE AISLE.\"--FORCALQUIER.]    The first glimpse of the interior is so relieving that one is not quick  to notice its lack of architectural unity. The few windows give a soft  light, and the brown of the stone has a mellowness that is both rich and  reposeful. If the Cathedral could have been finished in the style of the  first bays of the nave, it would have been a nobly dignified example of  the Romanesque. Could it have been re-built in the slender Gothic of the  last bay, it would have been an exquisite example of Provencal Gothic.  Rather largely planned, its old form of tunnel vaulting and the fine  curve of its nave arches and heavy piers are in violent contrast to the  Gothic bay, with its pointed arch, its clustered columns and carved  capitals, which, even with the shallow choir and its long, slim windows,  is too slight a portion of the Cathedral to have independence or real  beauty. From its ritualistic position, it is the culminating point of  the church, and its discord with the Romanesque is unpleasantly  insistent. The side aisles, which were built in the XVII century, are  low, agreeable walks ending in the chapels of the smaller apses. They  are neither very regular nor very significant; but they give the church  pleasant size and perspectives, and by avoiding the unduly large and  shining modern chandeliers which hang between the nave arches, one gets  from these side aisles the suggestive views which show only too well  what true and good architectural ideas were brought to confusion in the  re-building, the additions, and the restorations of the centuries. In  painting, anachronisms may be quaint or even amusing; but in  architecture, they are either grotesque or tragic, and in a church of  such fine suggestiveness as Notre-Dame at Forcalquier, one is haunted by  lingering regrets for what might and should have been.      [Sidenote: Vence.]    A founder of the French Academy and one of its first immortal forty was  Antoine Godeau, \"the idol of the Hotel Rambouillet.\" His mind was  formed, as it were, by one of the most clever women of that brilliantly  foolish coterie, he sang frivolous sonnets to a beautiful red-haired  mistress whom he sincerely admired, and when he entered Holy Church,  none of his charming friends believed that he would do more than modify  the proper and agreeable conventionalities of his former life. They  thought that he would add to the grace of his worldly manner the suavity  of the ecclesiastic, that he would choose a pulpit of Paris, and that,  sitting at his feet, they could enjoy the elegant phrases with which he  would embellish a refined and delicately attenuated religion. But an  aged prelate of the far South judged the new priest differently, he had  sounded the heart of the man who, at the age of thirty, had quietly  renounced a flattering, admiring world; and his dying prayer to  Richelieu was that Godeau should succeed him in the See of Vence. The  keen worldly wisdom of the Cardinal confirmed the old Bishop's more  spiritual insight, and Godeau was named Bishop of the neighbouring  Grasse.    Far away in his mountain-city of flower gardens and sweet odours, the  new Bishop wrote to his Parisian friends that, for his part, he \"found  more thorns than orange-blossoms.\" The Calvinists, from the rock of  Antibes, openly defied him; in spite of the vehement opposition of their  Chapters and against his will, the Bishoprics of Grasse and Vence were  united, and he was made the Bishop of the two warring, discontented  Sees. He was stoned at Vence; and even his colleague in temporal power,  the Marquis of Villeneuve, showed himself as insolent as he dared. At  length the King came to his aid, and being given his choice of the Sees,  Godeau immediately left \"the perfumed wench,\" as he called Grasse, and  chose to live and work among his one-time enemies of Vence. This gentle  and courageous prelate is typical of the long line of wise men who ruled  the Church in the tight little city of the Provencal hills. From Saint  Veran the wonder-worker, and Saint Lambert the tender nurse of lepers,  to the end, they were men noted for bravery, goodness, and learning, and  it was not till the Revolution that one was found--and fittingly the  last--who, hating the \"Oath\" and fearing the guillotine, fled his See.    This city of good Bishops was founded in the dim, pagan past of Gaul.  From a rocky hill-top, its inhabitants had watched the burning of their  first valley-town and they founded the second Vence on that height of  safety to which they had escaped with their lives. Here, far above the  Aurelian road, the Gallic tribes had a strong and isolated camp. Then  the prying Romans found them out, and priests of Mars and Cybele  replaced those of the cruder native gods, and they, in turn, gave way to  the apostle of the Christians. Where a temple stood, a church was built;  and unlike many early saints who looked upon old pagan images as homes  of devils and broke them into a thousand pieces with holy wrath and  words of exorcism, the prelate of Vence buried an image of a vanquished  god under each and every pillar of his church, in sign of Christian  triumph.    These early days of the Faith were days of growth for the little city,  and she prospered in her Mediaevalism. High on her hill, she was too  difficult of access to suffer greatly from marauding foes, and hidden  from the sea, she did not excite the cupidity of the Mediterranean  rovers. When Antibes and Nice were sacked, her little ledge of rock was  safe; and people crowded thick and fast behind her walls, until no  bee-hive swarmed so thick with bees as her few streets with citizens.  Here were arts and occupations, burghers and charters, riches and  liberties. Here came the Renaissance, and Vence had eager, if not famous  sculptors, painters, and organ-builders, and a family of artists whom  even the dilettante Francis I deigned to patronise.    Such memories of a busy, energetic past seem fairy-tales to those who  walk to-day about the dark and narrow streets of Vence. She scarcely has  outgrown her ancient walls, her civic life is dead, and in her virtual  isolation from the modern world she lives a dreary, quiet old age.    The old Cathedral, Notre-Dame, lies in the heart of the town; and takes  one back along the years, far past the Renaissance, to those grim  mediaeval days when even churches were places of defence. It is a low,  unimpressive building, said to have been built on the site of the Roman  Temple in the IV century. Enlarged or re-built in the X century, it was  then long and narrow, a Latin cross. But in the XII century, deep, dark  bays were added; in the XV, tribunes were built, the form of the apse  was changed to an oval and it was decorated in an inharmonious style;  and a hundred years ago the nave vault was re-built in an ellipse.    [Illustration: \"THE OLD ROUND ARCH OF THE BISHOP'S PALACE.\"--VENCE.]    In the side wall there is a low portal of a late, decadent style, which  opens on the little square, but there is no real facade; and to see the  church, the traveller passed under the old round arch of the Bishop's  Palace, through a small, damp street to another tinier square where the  apse and tower stand. The little Cathedral-churches of Provence are  always simply built, but here a rectangle, a low gabled roof, a small,  round-headed window in the wall, would have been architectural bareness  if a high, straight tower had not crowned it all. This crenellated tower  is a true type of its time, square, yet slim and strong, and crudely  graceful as some tall young poplar of the plains beneath. In the XI and  XII centuries, its early days, it was the city's lookout. Families lived  high up in its walls, and the traveller could imagine, in this little  old, deserted square, the crowds who gathered round the tower's base,  and called for news of enemies and battle as moderns gather about the  more prosaic bulletin of printed news. He could see them surging,  peering up; and from above he almost heard the watcher's cry, \"They're  coming on,\"--with the great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22728"],[0,"The Foundations of the Origin of Species (#11)"],[1,"which existed in  profoundly deep seas in progress of conversion from sea to land: if they  are first they <? we> give up. Not so Hutton or Lyell: if first  reptile{118} of Red Sandstone <?> really was first which existed: if  Pachyderm{119} of Paris was first which existed: fish of Devonian:  dragon fly of Lias: for we cannot suppose them the progenitors: they  agree too closely with existing divisions. But geologists consider  Europe as <?> a passage from sea to island <?> to continent (except  Wealden, see Lyell). These animals therefore, I consider then mere  introduction <?> from continents long since submerged.         {117} Compare _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 307, vi. p. 448.         {118} I have interpreted as _Sandstone_ a scrawl which I first read       as _Sea_; I have done so at the suggestion of Professor Judd, who       points out that \"footprints in the red sandstone were known at that       time, and geologists were not then particular to distinguish       between Amphibians and Reptiles.\"         {119} This refers to Cuvier's discovery of _Palaeotherium_ &c. at       Montmartre.    Finally, if views of some geologists be correct, my theory must be given  up. [Lyell's views, as far as they go, are in _favour_, but they go so  little in favour, and so much more is required, that it may <be> viewed as  objection.] If geology present us with mere pages in chapters, towards  end of <a> history, formed by tearing out bundles of leaves, and each page  illustrating merely a small portion of the organisms of that time, the  facts accord perfectly with my theory{120}.         {120} This simile is more fully given in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p.       310, vi. p. 452. \"For my part, following out Lyell's metaphor, I       look at the natural geological record, as a history of the world       imperfectly kept, and written in a changing dialect; of this       history we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or       three countries. Of this volume, only here and there a short       chapter has been preserved; and of each page, only here and there a       few lines. Each word of the slowly-changing language, in which the       history is supposed to be written, being more or less different in       the interrupted succession of chapters, may represent the       apparently abruptly changed forms of life, entombed in our       consecutive, but widely separated formations.\" Professor Judd has       been good enough to point out to me, that Darwin's metaphor is       founded on the comparison of geology to history in Ch. i. of the       _Principles of Geology_, Ed. i. 1830, vol. i. pp. 1-4. Professor       Judd has also called my attention to another       passage,--_Principles_, Ed. i. 1833, vol. iii. p. 33, when Lyell       imagines an historian examining \"two buried cities at the foot of       Vesuvius, immediately superimposed upon each other.\" The historian       would discover that the inhabitants of the lower town were Greeks       while those of the upper one were Italians. But he would be wrong       in supposing that there had been a sudden change from the Greek to       the Italian language in Campania. I think it is clear that Darwin's       metaphor is partly taken from this passage. See for instance (in       the above passage from the _Origin_) such phrases as \"history ...       written in a changing dialect\"--\"apparently abruptly changed forms       of life.\" The passage within [] in the above paragraph:--\"Lyell's       views as far as they go &c.,\" no doubt refers, as Professor Judd       points out, to Lyell not going so far as Darwin on the question of       the imperfection of the geological record.    _Extermination._ We have seen that in later periods the organisms have  disappeared by degrees and [perhaps] probably by degrees in earlier, and  I have said our theory requires it. As many naturalists seem to think  extermination a most mysterious circumstance{121} and call in  astonishing agencies, it is well to recall what we have shown concerning  the struggle of nature. An exterminating agency is at work with every  organism: we scarcely see it: if robins would increase to thousands in  ten years how severe must the process be. How imperceptible a small  increase: fossils become rare: possibly sudden extermination as  Australia, but as present means very slow and many means of escape, I  shall doubt very sudden exterminations. Who can explain why some species  abound more,--why does marsh titmouse, or ring-ouzel, now little  change,--why is one sea-slug rare and another common on our coasts,--why  one species of Rhinoceros more than another,--why is <illegible> tiger of  India so rare? Curious and general sources of error, the place of an  organism is instantly filled up.         {121} On rarity and extinction see _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 109, 319,       vi. pp. 133, 461.    We know state of earth has changed, and as earthquakes and tides go on,  the state must change,--many geologists believe a slow gradual cooling.  Now let us see in accordance with principles of [variation]  specification explained in Sect. II. how species would probably be  introduced and how such results accord with what is known.    The first fact geology proclaims is immense number of extinct forms, and  new appearances. Tertiary strata leads to belief, that forms gradually  become rare and disappear and are gradually supplied by others. We see  some forms now becoming rare and disappearing, we know of no sudden  creation: in older periods the forms _appear_ to come in suddenly, scene  shifts: but even here Devonian, Permian &c. [keep on supplying new links  in chain]--Genera and higher forms come on and disappear, in same way  leaving a species on one or more stages below that in which the form  abounded.      <GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.>    Sec. VI. Let us consider the absolute state of distribution of organisms of  earth's face.    Referring chiefly, but not exclusively (from difficulty of transport,  fewness, and the distinct characteristics of groups) to Mammalia; and  first considering the three or four main [regions] divisions; North  America, Europe, Asia, including greater part of E. Indian Archipelago  and Africa are intimately allied. Africa most distinct, especially most  southern parts. And the Arctic regions, which unite N. America, Asia and  Europe, only separated (if we travel one way by Behring's St.) by a  narrow strait, is most intimately allied, indeed forms but one  restricted group. Next comes S. America,--then Australia, Madagascar  (and some small islands which stand very remote from the land). Looking  at these main divisions separately, the organisms vary according to  changes in condition{122} of different parts. But besides this, barriers  of every kind seem to separate regions in a greater degree than  proportionally to the difference of climates on each side. Thus great  chains of mountains, spaces of sea between islands and continents, even  great rivers and deserts. In fact the amount <of> difference in the  organisms bears a certain, but not invariable relation to the amount of  physical difficulties to transit{123}.         {122} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 346, vi. p. 493, the author begins       his discussion on geographical distribution by minimising the       effect of physical conditions. He lays great stress on the effect       of _barriers_, as in the present Essay.         {123} Note in the original, \"Would it be more striking if we took       animals, take Rhinoceros, and study their habitats?\"    There are some curious exceptions, namely, similarity of fauna of  mountains of Europe and N. America and Lapland. Other cases just <the>  reverse, mountains of eastern S. America, Altai <?>, S. India <?>{124}:  mountain summits of islands often eminently peculiar. Fauna generally of  some islands, even when close, very dissimilar, in others very similar.  [I am here led to observe one or more centres of creation{125}.]         {124} Note by Mr A. R. Wallace. \"The want of similarity referred       to, is, between the mountains of Brazil and Guiana and those of the       Andes. Also those of the Indian peninsula as compared with the       Himalayas. In both cases there is continuous intervening land.         \"The islands referred to were, no doubt, the Galapagos for       dissimilarity from S. America; our own Islands as compared with       Europe, and perhaps Java, for similarity with continental Asia.\"         {125} The arguments against multiple centres of creation are given       in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 352, vi. p. 499.    The simple geologist can explain many of the foregoing cases of  distribution. Subsidence of a continent in which free means of  dispersal, would drive the lowland plants up to the mountains, now  converted into islands, and the semi-alpine plants would take place of  alpine, and alpine be destroyed, if mountains originally were not of  great height. So we may see, during gradual changes{126} of climate on a  continent, the propagation of species would vary and adapt themselves to  small changes causing much extermination{127}. The mountains of Europe  were quite lately covered with ice, and the lowlands probably partaking  of the Arctic climate and Fauna. Then as climate changed, arctic fauna  would take place of ice, and an inundation of plants from different  temperate countries <would> seize the lowlands, leaving islands of arctic  forms. But if this had happened on an island, whence could the new forms  have come,--here the geologist calls in creationists. If island formed,  the geologist will suggest <that> many of the forms might have been  borne from nearest land, but if peculiar, he calls in creationist,--as  such island rises in height &c., he still more calls in creation. The  creationist tells one, on a <illegible> spot the American spirit of  creation makes _Orpheus_ and _Tyrannus_ and American doves, and in  accordance with past and"]]]
