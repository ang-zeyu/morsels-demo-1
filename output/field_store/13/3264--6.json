They declare it takes three  times as long to repack a ship loaded at haphazard as it would have  taken to have loaded her on a system in the first instance. Six days per  ship is their notion of what they can do, but I trust to improve a bit  on that.    Hunter-Weston had written me a letter from Malta (just to hand) putting  it down in black and white that we have not a reasonable prospect of  success. He seemed keen and sanguine when we met and made no reference  to this letter: so it comes in now as rather a startler. But it is best  to have the black points thrust upon one's notice beforehand--so long  always as I keep it fixed in the back of my mind that there was never  yet a great thought or a great deed which was not cried down as  unreasonable before the fact by a number of reasonable people!    _30th March, 1915. Alexandria._ Have just dictated a long letter to Lord  K. in the course of which I have forced myself to say something which  may cause the great man annoyance. I feel it is up to me to risk that.  One thing--he knows I am not one of those rotters who ask for more than  they can possibly be given so that, if things go wrong, they may  complain of their tools. I have promised K. to help him by keeping my  demands down to bedrock necessities. I make no demand for ammunition on  the France and Flanders scale but--we must have _some_! There must be a  depot somewhere within hail. Here is the crucial para.:--    \"I realise how hard up you must be for ammunition, but I hope the M.G.O.  will have by now put in hand the building up of some reserves at our  base in Alexandria. If our batteries or battalions now serving in France  run short, something, at a pinch, can always be scraped together in  England and issued to them within 24 hours. Here it would be a question  of almost as many days, and, if it were to turn out that we have a long  and severe struggle, with no reserves nearer us than Woolwich--well--it  would not be pleasant! Moreover the number of howitzers, guns and rifles  in France is so enormous that it is morally impossible they should all  be hotly engaged at the same time. Thus they automatically form their  own reserves. In other words, a force possessing only ten howitzers  ought to have at least twice the reserves of a force possessing a  hundred howitzers. So at least it seems to me.\"    In the same letter I tell him about \"Birdwood's crowd\" and of their  splendid physique; their growing sense of discipline, their exceeding  great keenness, and wind up by saying that, given a fair chance, they  will, for certain, \"render a very good account of themselves.\"    Confabs with d'Amade and Hunter-Weston. Hunter-Weston's \"appreciation\"  of the situation at the Dardanelles is to be treated as an _ad interim_  paper; he wrote it, he says now, without the fuller knowledge he is  daily acquiring--knowledge which is tending to make him more sanguine.  His stay at Malta and his talks with Officers there had greatly  impressed him with the hardness of the nut we have to try and crack; so  much so that his paper suggests an indefinite putting off of the attempt  to throw open the Straits. I asked him if he had laid his view before K.  in London and he said, No; that he had not then come to it and that he  had not definitely come to it now.    D'Amade's own inclinations would have led him to Asia. When he left  France he did not know he was to be under me and he had made up his mind  to land at Adramiti. But now he waives all preconceived ideas and is  keen to throw himself heart and soul into Lord K.'s ideas and mine. He  would rather I did not even refer to his former views as he sees they  are expressly barred by the tenor of my instructions. The French are  working to time in getting ship-shape. The 29th Division are arriving up  to date and about one-third of them have landed. We are fixing up our  gear for floating and other piers and are trying to improvise ways and  means of coping with the water problem--this ugly nightmare of a water  problem. The question of the carriage and storage of water for thousands  of men and horses over a roadless, mainly waterless track of country  should have been tackled before we left England.    To solve these conundrums we have had to recreate for ourselves a  special field service system of food, water and ammunition supply. As an  instance we have had to re-organise baggage sections of trains and fit  up store ships as substitutes for additional ammunition columns and  parks. We are getting on fairly fast with our work of telling off troops  to transports so that each boat load of men landed will be, so to say,  on its own; victualled, watered and munitioned. But it takes some doing.  Greatly handicapped by absence of any Administrative, or Q. Staff. The  General Staff are working double shifts, at a task for which they have  never been trained:--      It's a way we have in the Aaarmy!    It's a way we have in the NAAAAvy!!    It's a way we have in the Eeeeeempire!!!       That nobody can deny!!!!    What would my friends on the Japanese General Staff say--or my quondam  friends on the German General Staff--if they knew that a  Commander-in-Chief had been for a fortnight in touch with his troops,  engaged with them upon a huge administrative job, and that he had not  one administrative Staff Officer to help him, but was willynilly using  his General Staff for the work? They would say \"mad Englishmen\" and this  time they would be right. The British public services are poisoned by  two enormous fallacies: (_a_) if a man does well in one business, he  will do equally well or better in another; (_b_) if a man does badly in  one business he will do equally badly or worse in another. There is  nothing beyond a vague, floating reputation or public opinion to enable  a new Minister to know his subordinates. The Germans have tabulated the  experiences and deficiencies of our leaders, active and potential, in  peace and war--we have not! Every British General of any note is  analysed, characterised and turned inside out in the bureau records of  the great German General Staff in Berlin. We only attempt anything of  that sort with burglars. My own portrait is in those archives and is  very good if not very flattering; so a German who had read it has told  me. This is organisation: this is business; but official circles in  England are so remote in their methods from these particular notions of  business that I must turn to a big newspaper shop to let anyone even  begin to understand what it is to run Q. business with a G.S. team.  Suppose Lord Northcliffe decided to embark upon a journalistic campaign  in Canada and that his scheme turned upon time; that it was a question  of Northcliffe catching time by the forelock or of time laying  Northcliffe by the heels. Suppose, further, that he had no first-hand  knowledge of Canada and had decided to place the conduct of the campaign  in the hands of his brother who would spy out the land; choose the best  site; buy a building; order the printing press; engage hands and start  the paper. Well; what staff would he send with him? A couple of leader  writers, a trio of special correspondents and half a dozen reporters?  Probably; but would there not also be berths taken in the Cunarder for a  manager trained in the business side of journalism? Quite a fair way of  putting the present case, although, on the other side, it is also fair  to add that British Officers have usually had to play so many parts in  the charade of square pegs in round holes, that they can catch a hold  anywhere, at any time, and carry on somehow.    _31st March, 1915. Alexandria._--Quill driving and dictating. Have made  several remonstrances lately at the way McMahon is permitting the  Egyptian Press to betray our intentions, numbers, etc. It is almost  incredible and Maxwell doesn't see his way clear to interfere. For the  last day or two they have been telling the Turks openly where we are  bound for. So I have written McMahon the following:--                       \"General Headquarters,                          \"18 RUE EL CAIED GOHAR,                              \"ALEXANDRIA, 31/3/15.      \"DEAR HIGH COMMISSIONER,    \"I was somewhat startled a couple of mornings ago by an article in the  _Egyptian Gazette_ giving away the arrival of the French troops, and  making open references to the Gallipoli Peninsula. The very frankness of  such communications may of course mislead the Turk into thinking we mean  thereby to take his mind off some other place which is our real  objective, but I doubt it. He knows our usual methods too well.    \"Consequently as it is very important at least to throw him into some  state of bewilderment as to our movements, I propose sending the  following cable to Lord Kitchener:--    \"'Whether of set purpose or through inadvertence articles have appeared  in Egyptian Press openly discussing arrival of French and British troops  and naming Gallipoli as their destination. Is there any political  objection to my cautiously spreading rumour that our true objective is,  say, Smyrna?'    \"Before I despatch the wire, however, I think I should like you to see  it, in case you have any objections. I have all the facilities for  spreading any rumour I like through my Intelligence Branch, which would  be less suspected than information leaking out from political sources.    \"Could you kindly send me a wire on receipt of this?                                                \"Yours sincerely,                                                 (_Sd._) \"IAN HAMILTON.\"    \"I only propose to ask Lord K. in case there may be political reasons  why I should not select any particular place about which to spread a  rumour of our landing.\"    Forgot to note a step taken yesterday--to nowhere perhaps--perhaps to  Constantinople. Yesterday the _Doris_ brought me a copy of a long cable  sent by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19322"],[0,"The Antichrist (#11)"],[1,"sensibility of the  tactile nerves which causes those suffering from it to recoil from every  touch, and from every effort to grasp a solid object. Brought to its  logical conclusion, such a physiological _habitus_ becomes an  instinctive hatred of all reality, a flight into the \"intangible,\" into  the \"incomprehensible\"; a distaste for all formulae, for all conceptions  of time and space, for everything established--customs, institutions,  the church--; a feeling of being at home in a world in which no sort of  reality survives, a merely \"inner\" world, a \"true\" world, an \"eternal\"  world.... \"The Kingdom of God is within _you_\"....      30.    _The instinctive hatred of reality_: the consequence of an extreme  susceptibility to pain and irritation--so great that merely to be  \"touched\" becomes unendurable, for every sensation is too profound.    _The instinctive exclusion of all aversion, all hostility, all bounds  and distances in feeling_: the consequence of an extreme susceptibility  to pain and irritation--so great that it senses all resistance, all  compulsion to resistance, as unbearable _anguish_ (--that is to say, as  _harmful_, as _prohibited_ by the instinct of self-preservation), and  regards blessedness (joy) as possible only when it is no longer  necessary to offer resistance to anybody or anything, however evil or  dangerous--love, as the only, as the _ultimate_ possibility of life....    These are the two _physiological realities_ upon and out of which the  doctrine of salvation has sprung. I call them a sublime  super-development of hedonism upon a thoroughly unsalubrious soil. What  stands most closely related to them, though with a large admixture of  Greek vitality and nerve-force, is epicureanism, the theory of salvation  of paganism. Epicurus was a _typical decadent_: I was the first to  recognize him.--The fear of pain, even of infinitely slight pain--the  end of this _can_ be nothing save a _religion of love_....      31.    I have already given my answer to the problem. The prerequisite to it is  the assumption that the type of the Saviour has reached us only in a  greatly distorted form. This distortion is very probable: there are many  reasons why a type of that sort should not be handed down in a pure  form, complete and free of additions. The milieu in which this strange  figure moved must have left marks upon him, and more must have been  imprinted by the history, the _destiny_, of the early Christian  communities; the latter indeed, must have embellished the type  retrospectively with characters which can be understood only as serving  the purposes of war and of propaganda. That strange and sickly world  into which the Gospels lead us--a world apparently out of a Russian  novel, in which the scum of society, nervous maladies and \"childish\"  idiocy keep a tryst--must, in any case, have _coarsened_ the type: the  first disciples, in particular, must have been forced to translate an  existence visible only in symbols and incomprehensibilities into their  own crudity, in order to understand it at all--in their sight the type  could take on reality only after it had been recast in a familiar  mould.... The prophet, the messiah, the future judge, the teacher of  morals, the worker of wonders, John the Baptist--all these merely  presented chances to misunderstand it.... Finally, let us not underrate  the _proprium_ of all great, and especially all sectarian veneration: it  tends to erase from the venerated objects all its original traits and  idiosyncrasies, often so painfully strange--_it does not even see  them_. It is greatly to be regretted that no Dostoyevsky lived in the  neighbourhood of this most interesting _decadent_--I mean some one who  would have felt the poignant charm of such a compound of the sublime,  the morbid and the childish. In the last analysis, the type, as a type  of the _decadence_, may actually have been peculiarly complex and  contradictory: such a possibility is not to be lost sight of.  Nevertheless, the probabilities seem to be against it, for in that case  tradition would have been particularly accurate and objective, whereas  we have reasons for assuming the contrary. Meanwhile, there is a  contradiction between the peaceful preacher of the mount, the sea-shore  and the fields, who appears like a new Buddha on a soil very unlike  India's, and the aggressive fanatic, the mortal enemy of theologians and  ecclesiastics, who stands glorified by Renan's malice as \"_le grand  maitre en ironie_.\" I myself haven't any doubt that the greater part of  this venom (and no less of _esprit_) got itself into the concept of the  Master only as a result of the excited nature of Christian propaganda:  we all know the unscrupulousness of sectarians when they set out to turn  their leader into an _apologia_ for themselves. When the early  Christians had need of an adroit, contentious, pugnacious and  maliciously subtle theologian to tackle other theologians, they  _created_ a \"god\" that met that need, just as they put into his mouth  without hesitation certain ideas that were necessary to them but that  were utterly at odds with the Gospels--\"the second coming,\" \"the last  judgment,\" all sorts of expectations and promises, current at the  time.--      32.    I can only repeat that I set myself against all efforts to intrude the  fanatic into the figure of the Saviour: the very word _imperieux_, used  by Renan, is alone enough to _annul_ the type. What the \"glad tidings\"  tell us is simply that there are no more contradictions; the kingdom of  heaven belongs to _children_; the faith that is voiced here is no more  an embattled faith--it is at hand, it has been from the beginning, it is  a sort of recrudescent childishness of the spirit. The physiologists, at  all events, are familiar with such a delayed and incomplete puberty in  the living organism, the result of degeneration. A faith of this sort is  not furious, it does not denounce, it does not defend itself: it does  not come with \"the sword\"--it does not realize how it will one day set  man against man. It does not manifest itself either by miracles, or by  rewards and promises, or by \"scriptures\": it is itself, first and last,  its own miracle, its own reward, its own promise, its own \"kingdom of  God.\" This faith does not formulate itself--it simply _lives_, and so  guards itself against formulae. To be sure, the accident of environment,  of educational background gives prominence to concepts of a certain  sort: in primitive Christianity one finds _only_ concepts of a  Judaeo-Semitic character (--that of eating and drinking at the last  supper belongs to this category--an idea which, like everything else  Jewish, has been badly mauled by the church). But let us be careful not  to see in all this anything more than symbolical language, semantics[6]  an opportunity to speak in parables. It is only on the theory that no  work is to be taken literally that this anti-realist is able to speak at  all. Set down among Hindus he would have made use of the concepts of  Sankhya,[7] and among Chinese he would have employed those of  Lao-tse[8]--and in neither case would it have made any difference to  him.--With a little freedom in the use of words, one might actually call  Jesus a \"free spirit\"[9]--he cares nothing for what is established: the  word _killeth_,[10] whatever is established _killeth_. The idea of  \"life\" as an _experience_, as he alone conceives it, stands opposed to  his mind to every sort of word, formula, law, belief and dogma. He  speaks only of inner things: \"life\" or \"truth\" or \"light\" is his word  for the innermost--in his sight everything else, the whole of reality,  all nature, even language, has significance only as sign, as  allegory.--Here it is of paramount importance to be led into no error by  the temptations lying in Christian, or rather _ecclesiastical_  prejudices: such a symbolism _par excellence_ stands outside all  religion, all notions of worship, all history, all natural science, all  worldly experience, all knowledge, all politics, all psychology, all  books, all art--his \"wisdom\" is precisely a _pure ignorance_[11] of all  such things. He has never heard of _culture_; he doesn't have to make  war on it--he doesn't even deny it.... The same thing may be said of the  _state_, of the whole bourgeoise social order, of labour, of war--he has  no ground for denying \"the world,\" for he knows nothing of the  ecclesiastical concept of \"the world\".... _Denial_ is precisely the  thing that is impossible to him.--In the same way he lacks argumentative  capacity, and has no belief that an article of faith, a \"truth,\" may be  established by proofs (--_his_ proofs are inner \"lights,\" subjective  sensations of happiness and self-approval, simple \"proofs of power\"--).  Such a doctrine _cannot_ contradict: it doesn't know that other  doctrines exist, or _can_ exist, and is wholly incapable of imagining  anything opposed to it.... If anything of the sort is ever encountered,  it laments the \"blindness\" with sincere sympathy--for it alone has  \"light\"--but it does not offer objections....    [6] The word _Semiotik_ is in the text, but it is probable that  _Semantik_ is what Nietzsche had in mind.    [7] One of the six great systems of Hindu philosophy.

In the whole psychology of the \"Gospels\" the concepts of guilt and  punishment are lacking, and so is that of reward. \"Sin,\" which means  anything that puts a distance between God and man, is abolished--_this  is precisely the \"glad tidings.\"_ Eternal bliss is not merely promised,  nor is it bound up with conditions: it is conceived as the _only_  reality--what remains consists"]]]
