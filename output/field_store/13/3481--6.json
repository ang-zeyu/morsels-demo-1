Toward evening  especially, the gnarled and twisted olive has a strangely sad and sombre  effect, with its long, pointed leaves of dull green lined with a chilly  pale tint--as it were, a thing of a past period in the earth's  existence, ancient and venerable, almost sacred, and little in harmony  with the gay, luxuriant vegetable life around. I think nothing  describes better its cold sombre aspect than the remark Marianne Hunt  made to her husband during their first unfortunate visit to Italy. \"They  look,\" she said, \"as if they were always standing in the moonlight.\"  And, indeed, this is just the effect they have, as though having been  once lighted on by Cynthia's cold, chaste glance, they had ever remained  petrified and blanched. Still, there is much grace and beauty in the  outlines of olive trees against a sunlit, blue-grey sky, the silver  tints of their leaves quivering in the light.    It was interesting to watch a procession of caterpillars on the road to  Monte Carlo, a distance of about a mile. They were moving from one part  to another, probably because there was disease amongst them, or else in  the trees in that neighbourhood, for there were many dead ones lying  about. They advanced in one long line, following their leader, the head  of the second joining the tail of the first, and so on. There were more  than a hundred in a chain, a company of ten coming to join them, and  large masses waiting in different parts of the road, and taking their  places one by one as the procession approached. They looked like a long,  thin snake. The marvellous instinct of these small insects,  notwithstanding Mark Twain's ingenious stricture on the proverbial  \"ant,\" will ever remain a source of the deepest interest and wonder to  thinking, reasoning, intellectual man.    This wonderful army of caterpillars suggested, as things in nature will  often do if one takes heed of them, that it might be possible to  introduce the culture of the silkworm here, and so substitute a  profitable and honest industry for the present curse of this beautiful  and otherwise highly favoured place. Silk is almost a staple of Italian  industry, and doubtless the mulberry tree would flourish here as in  other parts, and with as much success as at Beyrout, on the coast of  Syria, a place not at all unlike Monte Carlo in its climate, the beauty  of coast scenery, and luxuriance of vegetation.    [C] The recent destruction of the Grand Hotel at Giessbach is a  convincing proof of the truth of these remarks. Had it occurred but a  month earlier, there would inevitably have been a terrible loss of  life.                                        CHAPTER VI.    Monte Carlo--In the Concert-room--The Gambling-saloons--The Tables--The  moth and the candle--The true story of Monte Carlo--An International  grievance and disgrace.      We reached Monte Carlo in time for the grand concert at two o'clock.  Passing through the delightful gardens surrounded by _cafes_, we entered  the dazzling and gorgeous concert-room. There was nothing to pay.  Plush-liveried servants handed us to our seats, and we enjoyed their  soft luxuriance, admired the handsome and profuse decorations, and  scanned the mixed society around us, listening meanwhile to some of the  finest classical music.    After spending a pleasant hour, we retired to make room for others.  There was a silent expression on the countenances of the attendant  croupiers, and also on many of the faces of the habitues of the place,  which showed that, although this refined and intellectual enjoyment was  the ostensible reason of their presence, the real and more appreciated  object was the gaming-table.    Impelled by earnest desire to judge for ourselves as to the evils of  Monte Carlo, we followed the stream of people through the gilded and  handsome suite of ante-rooms, to the gambling-saloons. The obsequious  lacqueys opened the doors to all who wished to pass, and no questions  were asked, though I believe you are supposed to have your private  visiting card in readiness.        \"'Will you walk into my parlour?' said the spider to the fly.\"    There was no doubt on that day, at least, of the flies swarming in.  Frith's celebrated picture occurred instantly to my mind, and I saw at a  glance how faithful it was to the sad reality.    You cannot fail to be struck by the extreme quiet amongst so many  people. Every one speaks in whispers. There is a certain solemnity about  it, the same as that felt in a church; and truly this might be termed  the house of the devil. The large and spacious rooms, with beautifully  painted walls, Moorish ceilings, and polished floors, are without  furniture save the long tables and chairs for those intending to play  steadily. Here sit the yellow-faced, sleepless, hard-eyed croupiers,  spinning the fatal ball, and mechanically sweeping in with their rakes  the piles of money staked and lost by the infatuated players. These are  not limited to those seated at the table and who form but the front row.  What a mixture they are! Cadaverous, selfish old women; others,  handsome, gay, and reckless, evidently in the interest of the table, and  hired to act as decoys; others, again, young and inexperienced; and even  _ladies_, pale, unhappy-looking,--were all represented. The men for the  most part hardened and merciless, and many careless young gentlemen,  some of them innocent-looking lads enough, but others, alas! showing  painfully their habits of dissipation, in spite of their youth,--all  waiting eagerly to clutch their winnings or silently lose their money.    Further up the room are other tables, at which higher stakes are played.  _Trente et quarante_ is perhaps a little more favourable to players than  roulette, though it depends very much on the shuffling of the cards.  Piles of gold and notes were laid upon the table, either for or against  the numbers backed turning up. But here was the same sickening  sight--mad, selfish infatuation; and we turned away, having had quite  enough of the \"shady side\" of the lovely but too fascinating Monte  Carlo, being glad to get out into the bright sunshine once more. In the  rooms we had left, the blinds and curtains were closely drawn, excluding  the pure light of heaven, as if those so earnestly engaged within  preferred darkness to light because their deeds were evil.    A great number of people from the \"tables\" followed to catch the train,  and we had the sad reflection that a fresh batch would soon arrive in  time for the _evening_ concert. _Residents_ of Monaco and Monte Carlo  are not supposed to be admitted, as it is not desirable that the  half-frenzied losers should remain in these peaceful elysiums; a fresh  and continuous stream of victims is much preferred.    But these Shylock millionaires, the owners of the tables--these Princes  of Hades who alone profit by the wreck of their fellow-creatures, are  perfectly content to fatten, like over-gorged leeches, on the weaknesses  and follies of their prey. What matters it to them, the misery and  unhappiness of others, so long as they thrive? What matter the means, so  long as their end is obtained?    I am sorry to say that ladies are the greatest victims. They are more  easily tempted by their love of excitement and adventure, and once they  touch the fatal dice it is almost impossible to hold them in. Many  ladies who come to Nice and Mentone as invalids, go to Monte Carlo, not  only for the enchanting scenery, but for the fine concerts, which are  free to all comers. Indeed, most invalids long for such a means of  recreation, and it is a great pity they cannot obtain it elsewhere when  visiting the Riviera. Then their curiosity is aroused about the  gaming-tables, purposely encouraged by lying reports of people having  made their fortunes by a single throw of the dice. After the concert,  how natural to stroll into the gay saloons, the liveried servants so  politely opening the doors to them! And all this is the most cruel part  of the gambling fraternity--Messieurs Blanc and Co., who so heartlessly  lay out these alluring baits. Perchance these ladies are accompanied by  pure-minded daughters, all unthinking of the frightful contamination of  the numbers of so-called \"ladies of fashion\"--habitues and hirelings,  decoys simply in the pay of the gambling proprietaire. It is impossible  to know the moral injury it will do these innocent young girls. Then,  there is the husband who takes his wife, and permits her or himself to  chance a napoleon. It is impossible to touch pitch without defilement,  or to know where that one thoughtless yielding to temptation may lead.  Yes! it is too often just one napoleon and no more. Unfortunately they  win, and then of course they come again and again, with the sad result  of eventually losing all that is worth living for.    Some of these invalid ladies actually starve themselves, when they ought  to be nourishing and strengthening their poor bodies; acting meanly at  their hotels in order to save sufficient money to go to Monte Carlo, and  in the end it is all lost! Then they return to their homes with mind,  health, and nerves completely shattered, to the grief and astonishment  of kind friends and family doctors. There is no doubt that when people  are once tempted, it creates in them quite a disease; this is called  \"play-fever.\"    An English gentleman staying at the same hotel with us told me that he  came to the Riviera almost every year, and that he limited himself to  L100 for the gaming pleasures at Monte Carlo, which he could not resist,  and this sum he invariably lost at the end of the season.    But, of course, all those who frequent this place are not \"innocents  abroad.\" That is another evil resulting from this pandemonium.

The supports are made of  selected white pine, which must be absolutely free from pitch. The pine  is soft enough to work easily with the point and stands wear much better  than basswood. The tops and braces are made of curly fir, all of the  material must be 2-in. lumber, which dresses to about an inch and a  half. All surfaces, except the faces of the supports, are given a  well-rubbed coat of oil with a little burnt umber, the stain to be  applied directly to the wood without a filler.    On the outside of the supports the design is drawn in with pencil, the  background is then cut out smoothly with a chisel to the depth of an  eighth of an inch, leaving the decoration in relief. It is then burned  deeply, the background in straight flat strokes, the outlines having the  effect of a sloping, dark edge. The shadows are burned in as deeply as  possible and the shading is put in with the flat of the point.    A wax or egg-shell oil varnish finish is most suitable for this set.    [Illustration: Grille for an Arch]          A GRILLE WITH PEDESTALS TO MATCH      The accompanying sketch shows something unique in a grille that adds to  the appearance of a home furnished in mission style. When it is stained  and finished to match the furniture, it gives a consummate tone that  would be difficult to obtain by any other means.    To get the best results it should be made to blend with the furniture  and the arch in which it is to fit, in both weight and style. This will  depend very much upon one's preference, and for this reason full  dimensions are not given. No difficulty will be experienced, however, by  anyone handy with tools, in making it.    The material should be quarter-sawed oak, which can be secured planed  and sanded at the mill. For the grille order 1 by 1-1/2-in. and 1/2 by  1-1/2-in. stock. The method of making the bars is shown in the detailed  sketch. The two end bars should be made of solid pieces, 3/4 by 1-1/2  in., with two rectangular slots mortised in each to receive the  supports. The supports should be just the right length to go in the  arch. To erect, slip the end bars on the supports, hold the grille in  place and fasten the bars to the sides of the arch with screws.    The size of the pedestals and the connecting pieces will depend upon the  size of the arch. These connecting pieces should be well mortised into  the post, and if you own your own home and intend the pedestals to  become a fixture, they should also be mortised into the sides of the  arch. If not, they may be fastened to the arch with blind screws. The  amount of material required will depend upon the size of the arch.          A LADY'S WRITING DESK      This desk of mission style is a little more complicated than some of the  other pieces of mission furniture that have been described, but anyone  who has a fair knowledge of tools will not have much trouble in  constructing it in the home workshop if the plans are carefully  followed. Quarter-sawed oak is the best wood to use, as it is easy to  work and looks best when finished. Order the stock from the mill ready  cut to length, squared and sanded. Following is a list of the stock  needed:      2 front posts, 2 by 2 by 30 in.    2 back posts, 2 by 2 by 50 in.    1 bottom rail, 3/4 by 3 by 31 in.    2 end rails, 3/4 by 3 by 18 in.    1 stretcher, 3/4 by 8 by 33-1/2 in.    2 end slats, 3/8 by 8 by 15 in.    1 back slat, 3/8 by 8 by 15-1/2 in.    2 back slats, 3/8 by 3 by 15-1/2 in.    1 front drawer rail, 3/4 by 1-1/4 by 31-1/4 in.    2 side drawer rails, 3/4 by 3 by 18-1/4 in.    1 drawer front, 3/4 by 6 by 30 in.    1 desk lid, 3/4 by 18 by 31-1/4 in.    1 desk board, 3/4 by 19-1/4 by 31-1/4 in.    2 end boards, 3/4 by 19 by 21-1/4 in.    1 top board, 3/4 by 10 by 34 in.    1 top back board, 3/4 by 5 by 31-1/4 in.    1 back board, 3/4 by 30 by 22 in.    2 drawer sides, 1/2 by 6 by 19-1/2 in., S.W.    1 drawer end, 1/2 by 6 by 29 in., S.W.    1 drawer bottom, 1/2 by 18 by 29 in., S.W.    2 pieces for pigeon holes, 3/8 by 7 by 23 in., S.W.    8 pieces for pigeon holes, 3/8 by 4 by 6-3/4 in., S.W.    Start with the back posts, being sure they are square and of the right  length; place them side by side and lay out the mortises for the lower  rails, the desk rails and the top back boards, as shown in the  accompanying detail drawing. Lay out the front posts in the same manner.  Cut the tenons on the ends of the rails to fit the mortises in the  posts. Also cut mortises in the rails for the back and end slats. The  end rails have a mortise in them for the tenons on the ends of the foot  boards. Clamp the ends of the desk together, with the end rails in  place; then fit the side boards. Bore holes through the posts into the  side boards for dowels as shown. After the dowels are in place the holes  can be plugged.    [Illustration: Details of Writing Desk]    Cut and fit the top back board, the bottom rail, the back board and the  stretcher. Cut the top and desk boards at the back corners to clear the  posts. The top board is to be fastened to the side boards with blind  screws. The back board is fastened to the posts with dowels as shown.    [Illustration: Desk Complete]    When all the parts fit square and tight they can be glued together. The  ends of the desk should be glued up first and left to dry, then the  other parts put in place and glued. When clamping the parts together see  that they fit perfectly square and tight. While the glue is drying the  drawer can be made. The front board is made of oak, but the other parts  may be made of some soft wood. The side pieces are mortised and glued to  the front board, The end and bottom boards can be nailed together.    The drop lid of the desk is made as shown. Two or more boards may have  to be glued together for the lid, the desk bottom and the back board.  The lid is fastened to the desk board with two hinges, and it should be  so arranged that when closed it will be even with the sides. Brackets or  chains are fastened to the inside to hold it in the proper position when  it is open. Small blocks of wood fastened to the inner edge of the side  boards will prevent it from closing too far. A lock, if desired, can be  purchased at a hardware store and fitted in place. Suitable handles for  the drawer should also be provided.    When the desk is complete go over it with fine sandpaper and remove all  rough spots. Scrape all glue from about the joints, as the finish will  not take where there is any glue.    The pigeonholes are made from 3/8-in. stock. They may be tacked in place  after the desk is finished.    The finish can be any one of the many mission stains supplied by the  trade for this purpose. If the desk is well made and finished, it will  have a very neat and attractive appearance.          A TELEPHONE STAND AND STOOL      The stand shown in the accompanying illustration is for use with a desk  telephone. The stool when not in use, slides on two runners under the  stand. A shelf is provided for the telephone directory, paper, pencil,  etc.    [Illustration: Stand and Stool Complete]    [Illustration: Details of Stand and Stool]    The joints may be made with dowels, or the mortise and tenon may be  used, as desired. If the latter is decided upon, allowance must be made  on the length of the rails for the tenons. The list given is for the  dowel-made joints. The following stock list gives the amount of material  needed which should be ordered planed and sanded. This work can be done  by hand if the builder has the time and desires to have an entire  home-made article. However, the list is given for the mill-planed  material.    STAND      4 posts, 1-1/2 in. square by 29 in.    2 rails, 7/8 by 5 by 11 in.    1 rail, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 13 in.    1 rail, 7/8 by 5 by 13 in.    2 runners, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 14 in.    1 top, 7/8 by 18 by 20 in.    1 shelf, 7/8 by 12-7/8 by 13-3/4 in.    STOOL      4 posts, 1-1/2 in. square by 17 in.    4 rails, 7/8 by 4 by 6-1/2 in.    4 rails, 7/8 by 2 by 6-1/2 in.    1 stretcher, 7/8 by 4 by 7-1/4 in.    1 top, 7/8 by 12-1/2 in. square.    The exact lengths for the posts are given in the list. Should the  builder desire to square them up, allowance must be made for this when  ordering stock.    Arrange all the pieces in the position they are to occupy in the  finished stand and stool and number all the joints. Locate the centers  and bore holes for all the dowels. Assemble the two sides of the table  first. Notch the runners and fasten them to the posts with flat-head  screws. Use hot glue on the dowel joints if possible.    Cut the corners out of the shelf to fit the legs and assemble the frame  of the table. Use round-head screws through the rails to hold the shelf.  The top may be fastened in two ways, with screws through cleats on the  inside of the rails and under the top, or with screws slanting through  the upper part of the rails and into the top as shown. The stool, is  assembled in the same manner as the stand.    The stand and stool should be finished to harmonize with the furniture  and woodwork of the room in which they are to be used.          HOW TO MAKE A DOWEL-CUTTING TOOL      Secure a piece of steel about 1/4 in. thick, 1-3/4 in. wide and 8 in.  long. Drill various sized holes through the steel as shown in Fig. 1,  leaving the edge of each hole as sharp as the drill will make them. Cut  off a block of wood the length necessary for the dowels and split it up  into pieces about the size for the particular dowel to be used. Lay the  steel on something flat, over a hole of some kind, then start one of the  pieces of wood in the proper size hole for the dowel and drive it  through with a hammer, as shown in Fig. 2. The sharp edges on the steel  will cut the dowel as smooth and round as if it were turned in a lathe.
