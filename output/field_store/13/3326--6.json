Led on by  the holy man carrying the crucifix in his raised hand, they marched on  to the assault, stormed the castle, and made Hermann's troops flee in  great confusion. The ambitious count, now finding himself deserted by  his troops, was forced to renounce the feud which he had hoped to  carry on against the bishop.           *       *       *       *       *    The disgraceful defeat the count had suffered was most humiliating to  him, but it had not killed his ambition.    He now directed his thoughts to his other ecclesiastical neighbour.    Having searched through some ancient documents, he thought he had  found full right to a strip of land which Arnold of Solnhofen, Bishop  of Mayence, then held in possession. He at once sent in his claim to  this mighty prince of the church, who received it with a scornful  laugh. \"Oh!\" said the bishop, tearing up the written complaint, \"I  shall be able to manage this little count as well as I have all along  managed the stubborn people of Mayence, some of whom have bitterly  repented of having rebelled against their bishop.\"    Hermann was told how Solnhofen had treated his claim. In great wrath  he swore to take vengeance on the man who had dared to tear up his  complaint so contumeliously. His young wife implored him with tears in  her eyes not to raise his hand against a servant of the Lord again.  But he turned contemptuously away.    Herman was well aware that, through the influence of the bishop's  companions-in-arms, he was now hated by the citizens of Mayence. This  circumstance made him determine to rob Arnold of land and dignity, as  he ascribed the cause of this deadly dissension to the power the  bishop exerted over the people of his diocese.    The count, now joined by several daring knights, again prepared to  make war against the representative of the church, and marched to  attack the bishop in his stronghold.    Arnold was enraged at this persistent striving against the dominions  of the church, and his dark soul conceived a dastardly plan to rid  them of their enemy. He hired two villains who treacherously put the  count to death.    Soon afterwards the rebellious citizens of Mayence successfully  stormed the bishop's palace and turned the cruel prelate out of his  episcopal seat, whereupon he was obliged to flee for his life. But  Arnold was not so easily subdued and he soon returned, breathing  vengeance. His friends warned him in vain, and even the famous  prophetess, Hildegarde of Rupertusberg, sent a messenger to him with  the words, \"Turn to the Lord whom you have forsaken, your hour is  near at hand.\"    But he heeded not this admonition, and at last he was killed by the  rebels in the Abbey of Jacobsberg, some distance from the town where  he had taken up his residence.          KAUB    Castle Gutenfels      [Illustration: Turnier zu Koeln--Zu der Sage von Burg Gutenfels]    About the middle of the thirteenth century, there was a stately castle  near Kaub which was inhabited by Count Philip of Falkenstein. There he  lived very happily with his beautiful sister Guta, who was as good as  she was fair.    Numerous knights had sought to win her love, but none had achieved  this conquest, the castle maiden having no desire to exchange her  brother's hospitable home for any other.    At that time a magnificent tournament was held at Cologne, to which  knights from all countries of the kingdom far and near and even from  England were invited.    A great multitude of spectators were assembled to see the stately  knights contending for the prize, which a fair hand would bestow on  them.    Among the nobles present at the tournament was a knight from England,  whose graceful figure and splendid armour were particularly striking.  He wore a veiled visor, and the stewards of the tournament announced  him under the name of \"the Lion Knight,\" a golden lion ornamenting his  shield. Soon the majestic knight's master-like manner of fighting  created a great sensation, and when he succeeded in unhorsing his  opponent, a most formidable combatant, loud rejoicings rang through  the lists.    Count Philip and his sister were among the guests. Guta had been  watching the strange knight with ever increasing interest during the  tournament, regretting at the same time that she could not see his  face.    But an opportunity soon presented itself when the knight was declared  victor. When she was selected to present the prize, a golden  laurel-wreath, to the winner, she became much embarrassed, and a  feeling such as she had never before experienced seized her as she  looked at the Briton's face for the first time.    Perhaps the knight may have read in the lovely maiden's countenance  what she in vain tried to hide from him, perhaps a spark from that  passionate fire which had so suddenly fired her heart, may have flown  into his soul as he knelt before her to receive the wreath, which she  placed on his head with a trembling hand. Who can tell?    Afterwards when these two were conversing together in subdued  whispers, the knight silently admiring her grace and the maiden  scarcely able to restrain her feelings, the thoughts which he longed  to tell her, flamed in his heart. The same evening in the banqueting  hall, when the music was sounding within its walls, he was Guta's  inseparable companion, and eloquent words flowed from his lips telling  her of the love which his eyes betrayed.    The proud stranger begged Guta for her love and swore to be hers; he  told her he must at once return to his country where urgent duty  called him, but that he would come back to claim her in three months'  time. Then he would publicly sue for her hand and declare his name,  which circumstances compelled him to keep secret for the time being.    Love will make any sacrifice; Guta accepted her lover's pledge  willingly, and thus they parted under the assurance that they would  soon meet again.    Five months had passed. That terrible time ensued when Germany became  the battle-field of the party-struggles over the election of the  emperor. Conrad IV., the last of the house of Hohenstaufen, had died  in Italy. In the northern countries there was a great rising against  William of Holland who was struggling for the imperial throne;  Alphonso of Castile was chosen king in one part of the country, while  Richard of Cornwall, son of John, king of England, was elected in  another; but Richard, having received most influential votes, was  crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle, and from thence he started on a journey  through the Rhine provinces, to the favour of which he had been  chiefly indebted for his election.           *       *       *       *       *    Spring was casting her bright beams over waves and mountains in the  valley of the Rhine, but in Falkenstein castle no ray of sunshine  penetrated the gloom. Guta, pale and unhappy, sat within its walls,  weaving dreams which seemed destined never to be fulfilled. Sometimes  she saw her lover dying on a terrible battle-field with her name on  his lips, then again laughing and bright with a maiden from that  far-off island in his arms, talking derisively of his sweetheart on  the Rhine. She became more and more conscious that she had given him  her first love, and that he had cruelly deceived her. Sorrow and grief  had taken possession of her, and all her brother's efforts to amuse  her and to distract her attention were in vain.    A great sound of trumpets was heard one day on the highway, and a  troop of knights stopped at the castle. Guta saw the train of warriors  from her window, where she had been sitting weeping. The count with  chivalrous hospitality received them, and led them into the  banqueting-hall. His astonishment was great, when he recognised the  bold Briton, the victor at the tournament in Cologne, as leader of  this brilliant retinue, he who had broken his secret pledge to his  beloved sister. A dark glance took the place of the friendly  expression on his face. The Briton seemed to notice it and pressing  Philip's hand said cordially, \"I am Richard of Cornwall, elected  Emperor of Germany, and I have come here to solicit the hand of your  sister Guta, who promised herself to me five months ago in Cologne. I  come late to redeem my promise, but my love is unchanged. I beg you to  announce my arrival to her without betraying my name.\"    Philip bowed deeply before the illustrious guest, and the retainers  respectfully retired to a distance. The great guest strode up and down  the room impatiently. Then the doors were suddenly thrown open, and a  beautiful figure appeared on the threshold, her face glowing with  emotion.    With a low cry Guta threw herself into her lover's arms, and the first  moments of their reunion were passed in silent happiness.    Philip now entered the room unperceived, and revealed the secret to  his sister. The maiden in great confusion and shame stole a look at  her lover's eyes, and he, drawing her gently to him, asked her to  share all--even his throne with him.    Shortly afterwards Richard celebrated his marriage with imperial  magnificence at the castle on the Rhine, which Philip thence forward  called Gutenfels, in honour of his sister.          OBERWESEL    The Seven Maidens      The scattered ruins of an old knight's tower are still to be seen on  one of the heights near Oberwesel. The castle was called Schoenberg,  after the seven virgins who once lived there, and whose beauty was  renowned throughout all the Rhine countries.    Their father had died early, some say of grief, because Heaven had  denied him a son, and an elderly aunt had striven in vain to guide the  seven wild sisters; but her influence had not been sufficiently strong  to lead them in the right way. After the death of this relative the  seven beautiful maidens were left to themselves, and now their longing  after"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20511"],[0,"The Little Mother Goose (#11)"],[1,"the reason why?
