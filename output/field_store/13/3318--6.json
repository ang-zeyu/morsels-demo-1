It was about this time, Worby thought, that his little dog began to  wear an anxious expression when the hour for it to be put into the  shed in the back yard approached. (For his mother had ordained that it  must not sleep in the house.) One evening, he said, when he was just  going to pick it up and carry it out, it looked at him \"like a  Christian, and waved its 'and, I was going to say--well, you know 'ow  they do carry on sometimes, and the end of it was I put it under my  coat, and 'uddled it upstairs--and I'm afraid I as good as deceived my  poor mother on the subject. After that the dog acted very artful with  'iding itself under the bed for half-an-hour or more before bed-time  came, and we worked it so as my mother never found out what we'd  done.\" Of course Worby was glad of its company anyhow, but more  particularly when the nuisance that is still remembered in  Southminster as \"the crying\" set in.    \"Night after night,\" said Worby, \"that dog seemed to know it was  coming; he'd creep out, he would, and snuggle into the bed and cuddle  right up to me shivering, and when the crying come he'd be like a wild  thing, shoving his head under my arm, and I was fully near as bad. Six  or seven times we'd hear it, not more, and when he'd dror out his 'ed  again I'd know it was over for that night. What was it like, sir?  Well, I never heard but one thing that seemed to hit it off. I  happened to be playing about in the Close, and there was two of the  Canons met and said 'Good morning' one to another. 'Sleep well last  night?' says one--it was Mr. Henslow that one, and Mr. Lyall was the  other--'Can't say I did,' says Mr. Lyall, 'rather too much of Isaiah  34. 14 for me.' '34. 14,' says Mr. Henslow, 'what's that?' 'You call  yourself a Bible reader!' says Mr. Lyall. (Mr. Henslow, you must know,  he was one of what used to be termed Simeon's lot--pretty much what we  should call the Evangelical party.) 'You go and look it up.' I wanted  to know what he was getting at myself, and so off I ran home and got  out my own Bible, and there it was: 'the satyr shall cry to his  fellow.' Well, I thought, is that what we've been listening to these  past nights? and I tell you it made me look over my shoulder a time or  two. Of course I'd asked my father and mother about what it could be  before that, but they both said it was most likely cats: but they  spoke very short, and I could see they was troubled. My word! that was  a noise--'ungry-like, as if it was calling after some one that  wouldn't come. If ever you felt you wanted company, it would be when  you was waiting for it to begin again. I believe two or three nights  there was men put on to watch in different parts of the Close; but  they all used to get together in one corner, the nearest they could to  the High Street, and nothing came of it.    \"Well, the next thing was this. Me and another of the boys--he's in  business in the city now as a grocer, like his father before him--we'd  gone up in the Close after morning service was over, and we heard old  Palmer the mason bellowing to some of his men. So we went up nearer,  because we knew he was a rusty old chap and there might be some fun  going. It appears Palmer'd told this man to stop up the chink in that  old tomb. Well, there was this man keeping on saying he'd done it the  best he could, and there was Palmer carrying on like all possessed  about it. 'Call that making a job of it?' he says. 'If you had your  rights you'd get the sack for this. What do you suppose I pay you your  wages for? What do you suppose I'm going to say to the Dean and  Chapter when they come round, as come they may do any time, and see  where you've been bungling about covering the 'ole place with mess  and plaster and Lord knows what?' 'Well, master, I done the best I  could,' says the man; 'I don't know no more than what you do 'ow it  come to fall out this way. I tamped it right in the 'ole,' he says,  'and now it's fell out,' he says, 'I never see.'    \"'Fell out?' says old Palmer, 'why it's nowhere near the place. Blowed  out, you mean,' and he picked up a bit of plaster, and so did I, that  was laying up against the screen, three or four feet off, and not dry  yet; and old Palmer he looked at it curious-like, and then he turned  round on me and he says, 'Now then, you boys, have you been up to some  of your games here?' 'No,' I says, 'I haven't, Mr. Palmer; there's  none of us been about here till just this minute,' and while I was  talking the other boy, Evans, he got looking in through the chink, and  I heard him draw in his breath, and he came away sharp and up to us,  and says he, 'I believe there's something in there. I saw something  shiny.' 'What! I daresay,' says old Palmer; 'Well, I ain't got time to  stop about there. You, William, you go off and get some more stuff and  make a job of it this time; if not, there'll be trouble in my yard,'  he says.    \"So the man he went off, and Palmer too, and us boys stopped behind,  and I says to Evans, 'Did you really see anything in there?' 'Yes,' he  says, 'I did indeed.' So then I says, 'Let's shove something in and  stir it up.' And we tried several of the bits of wood that was laying  about, but they were all too big. Then Evans he had a sheet of music  he'd brought with him, an anthem or a service, I forget which it was  now, and he rolled it up small and shoved it in the chink; two or  three times he did it, and nothing happened. 'Give it me, boy,' I  said, and I had a try. No, nothing happened. Then, I don't know why I  thought of it, I'm sure, but I stooped down just opposite the chink  and put my two fingers in my mouth and whistled--you know the way--and  at that I seemed to think I heard something stirring, and I says to  Evans, 'Come away,' I says; 'I don't like this.' 'Oh, rot,' he says,  'Give me that roll,' and he took it and shoved it in. And I don't  think ever I see any one go so pale as he did. 'I say, Worby,' he  says, 'it's caught, or else some one's got hold of it.' 'Pull it out  or leave it,' I says, 'Come and let's get off.' So he gave a good  pull, and it came away. Leastways most of it did, but the end was  gone. Torn off it was, and Evans looked at it for a second and then he  gave a sort of a croak and let it drop, and we both made off out of  there as quick as ever we could. When we got outside Evans says to me,  'Did you see the end of that paper.' 'No,' I says, 'only it was torn.'  'Yes, it was,' he says, 'but it was wet too, and black!' Well, partly  because of the fright we had, and partly because that music was wanted  in a day or two, and we knew there'd be a set-out about it with the  organist, we didn't say nothing to any one else, and I suppose the  workmen they swept up the bit that was left along with the rest of the  rubbish. But Evans, if you were to ask him this very day about it,  he'd stick to it he saw that paper wet and black at the end where it  was torn.\"    After that the boys gave the choir a wide berth, so that Worby was not  sure what was the result of the mason's renewed mending of the tomb.  Only he made out from fragments of conversation dropped by the workmen  passing through the choir that some difficulty had been met with, and  that the governor--Mr. Palmer to wit--had tried his own hand at the  job. A little later, he happened to see Mr. Palmer himself knocking at  the door of the Deanery and being admitted by the butler. A day or so  after that, he gathered from a remark his father let fall at breakfast  that something a little out of the common was to be done in the  Cathedral after morning service on the morrow. \"And I'd just as soon  it was to-day,\" his father added, \"I don't see the use of running  risks.\" \"'Father,' I says, 'what are you going to do in the Cathedral  to-morrow?' and he turned on me as savage as I ever see him--he was a  wonderful good-tempered man as a general thing, my poor father was.  'My lad,' he says, 'I'll trouble you not to go picking up your elders'  and betters' talk: it's not manners and it's not straight. What I'm  going to do or not going to do in the Cathedral to-morrow is none of  your business: and if I catch sight of you hanging about the place  to-morrow after your work's done, I'll send you home with a flea in  your ear. Now you mind that.' Of course I said I was very sorry and  that, and equally of course I went off and laid my plans with Evans.  We knew there was a stair up in the corner of the transept which you  can get up to the triforium, and in them days the door to it was  pretty well always open, and even if it wasn't we knew the key usually  laid under a bit of matting hard by. So we made up our minds we'd be  putting away music and that, next morning while the rest of the boys  was clearing off, and then slip up the stairs and watch from the  triforium if there was any signs of work going on.    \"Well, that same night I dropped off asleep as sound as a boy does,  and all of a sudden the dog woke me up, coming into the bed, and  thought I, now we're going to get it sharp, for he seemed more  frightened than usual. After about five minutes sure enough came this  cry. I can't give you no idea what it was like; and so near  too--nearer than I'd heard it yet--and a funny thing, Mr. Lake, you  know what a place this Close is for an echo, and particular if you  stand this side of it. Well, this crying never made no sign of an echo  at all. But, as I said, it was dreadful near this night; and on the  top of the start I got with hearing it, I got another fright; for I  heard something rustling outside in the passage. Now to be sure I  thought I was done; but I noticed the dog seemed to perk up a bit, and  next there was some one whispered outside the door, and I very near  laughed out loud, for I knew it was my father and mother that had got"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20390"],[0,"Elements of Structural and Systematic Botany (#11)"],[1,"llithamnion_), of the  natural size. _B_, a piece of the same, x 50. _t_, tetraspores. _C_  i-v, successive stages in the development of the tetraspores, x 150.  _D_ I, II young procarps. _tr._ trichogyne. iii, young; iv, ripe spore  fruit.

The spores are here surrounded by a case,  x 50.]    The methods of reproduction may be best illustrated by a specific  example, and preferably one of the simpler ones, as these are most  readily studied microscopically.    The form here illustrated (_Callithamnion_) grows attached to wharves,  etc., below low-water mark, and is extremely delicate, collapsing  completely when removed from the water. The color is a bright rosy  red, and with its graceful form and extreme delicacy it makes one of  the most beautiful of the group.    If alcoholic material is used, it may be mounted for examination  either in water or very dilute glycerine.      The plant is composed of much-branched, slender filaments, closely    resembling _Cladophora_ in structure, but with smaller cells    (Fig. 29, _B_). The non-sexual reproduction is by means of special    spores, which from being formed in groups of four, are known as    tetraspores. In the species under consideration the mother cell of    the tetraspores arises as a small bud near the upper end of one of    the ordinary cells (Fig. 29, _C_ i). This bud rapidly increases in    size, assuming an oval form, and becoming cut off from the cell of    the stem (Fig. 29, _C_ ii). The contents now divide into four equal    parts, arranged like the quadrants of a sphere. When ripe, the wall    of the mother cell gives way, and the four spores escape into the    water and give rise to new plants. These spores, it will be noticed,    differ in one important particular from corresponding spores in most    algae, in being unprovided with cilia, and incapable of spontaneous    movement.      Occasionally in the same plant that bears tetraspores, but more    commonly in special ones, there are produced the sexual organs, and    subsequently the sporocarps, or fruits, developed from them. The    plants that bear them are usually stouter that the non-sexual ones,    and the masses of ripe carpospores are large enough to be readily    seen with the naked eye.      If a plant bearing ripe spores is selected, the young stages of the    female organ (procarp) may generally be found by examining the    younger parts of the plant. The procarp arises from a single cell of    the filament. This cell undergoes division by a series of    longitudinal walls into a central cell and about four peripheral    ones (Fig. 29, _D_ i). One of the latter divides next into an upper    and a lower cell, the former growing out into a long, colorless    appendage known as a trichogyne (Fig. 29, _D_, _tr._).      The antheridia (Fig. 29, _E_) are hemispherical masses of closely    set colorless cells, each of which develops a single spermatozoid    which, like the tetraspores, is destitute of cilia, and is dependent    upon the movement of the water to convey it to the neighborhood of    the procarp. Occasionally one of these spermatozoids may be found    attached to the trichogyne, and in this way fertilization is    effected. Curiously enough, neither the cell which is immediately    fertilized, nor the one beneath it, undergo any further change; but    two of the other peripheral cells on opposite sides of the filament    grow rapidly and develop into large, irregular masses of spores    (Fig. 29, _D_ III, IV).    While the plant here described may be taken as a type of the group,  it must be borne in mind that many of them differ widely, not only in  the structure of the plant body, but in the complexity of the sexual  organs and spores as well. The tetraspores are often imbedded in the  tissues of the plant, or may be in special receptacles, nor are they  always arranged in the same way as here described, and the same is  true of the carpospores. These latter are in some of the higher forms,  _e.g._ _Polysiphonia_ (Fig. 29, _F_), contained in urn-shaped  receptacles, or they may be buried within the tissues of the plant.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--Marine red seaweeds. _A_, _Dasya_. _B_,  _Rhodymenia_ (with smaller algae attached). _C_, _Grinnellia_. _D_,  _Delesseria_. _A_, _B_, natural size; the others reduced one-half.]    The fresh-water forms are not common, but may occasionally be met with  in mill streams and other running water, attached to stones and  woodwork, but are much inferior in size and beauty to the marine  species. The red color is not so pronounced, and they are, as a rule,  somewhat dull colored.    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--Fresh-water red algae. _A_, _Batrachospermum_,  x about 12. _B_, a branch of the same, x 150. _C_, _Lemanea_, natural  size.]    The commonest genera are _Batrachospermum_ and _Lemanea_ (Fig. 31).          CHAPTER VIII.    SUB-KINGDOM III.    FUNGI.      The name \"Fungi\" has been given to a vast assemblage of plants,  varying much among themselves, but on the whole of about the same  structural rank as the algae. Unlike the algae, however, they are  entirely destitute of chlorophyll, and in consequence are dependent  upon organic matter for food, some being parasites (growing upon  living organisms), others saprophytes (feeding on dead matter). Some  of them show close resemblances in structure to certain algae, and  there is reason to believe that they are descended from forms that  originally had chlorophyll; others are very different from any green  plants, though more or less evidently related among themselves.  Recognizing then these distinctions, we may make two divisions of the  sub-kingdom: I. The Alga-Fungi (_Phycomycetes_), and II. The True  Fungi (_Mycomycetes_).      CLASS I.--_Phycomycetes_.    These are fungi consisting of long, undivided, often branching tubular  filaments, resembling quite closely those of _Vaucheria_ or other  _Siphoneae_, but always destitute of any trace of chlorophyll. The  simplest of these include the common moulds (_Mucorini_), one of which  will serve to illustrate the characteristics of the order.    If a bit of fresh bread, slightly moistened, is kept under a bell jar  or tumbler in a warm room, in the course of twenty-four hours or so it  will be covered with a film of fine white threads, and a little later  will produce a crop of little globular bodies mounted on upright  stalks. These are at first white, but soon become black, and the  filaments bearing them also grow dark-colored.    These are moulds, and have grown from spores that are in the  atmosphere falling on the bread, which offers the proper conditions  for their growth and multiplication.    One of the commonest moulds is the one here figured (Fig. 32), and  named _Mucor stolonifer_, from the runners, or \"stolons,\" by which it  spreads from one point to another. As it grows it sends out these  runners along the surface of the bread, or even along the inner  surface of the glass covering it. They fasten themselves at intervals  to the substratum, and send up from these points clusters of short  filaments, each one tipped with a spore case, or \"sporangium.\"      For microscopical study they are best mounted in dilute glycerine    (about one-quarter glycerine to three-quarters pure water). After    carefully spreading out the specimens in this mixture, allow a drop    of alcohol to fall upon the preparation, and then put on the cover    glass. The alcohol drives out the air, which otherwise interferes    badly with the examination.      The whole plant consists of a very long, much-branched, but    undivided tubular filament. Where it is in contact with the    substratum, root-like outgrowths are formed, not unlike those    observed in _Vaucheria_. At first the walls are colorless, but later    become dark smoky brown in color. A layer of colorless granular    protoplasm lines the wall, becoming more abundant toward the growing    tips of the branches. The spore cases, \"sporangia,\" arise at the    ends of upright branches (Fig. 32, _C_), which at first are    cylindrical (_a_), but later enlarge at the end (_b_), and become    cut off by a convex wall (_c_). This wall pushes up into the young    sporangium, forming a structure called the \"columella.\" When fully    grown, the sporangium is globular, and appears quite opaque, owing    to the numerous granules in the protoplasm filling the space between    the columella and its outer wall. This protoplasm now divides into a    great number of small oval cells (spores), which rapidly darken,    owing to a thick, black wall formed about each one, and at the same    time the columella and the stalk of the sporangium become    dark-colored.      When ripe, the wall of the sporangium dissolves, and the spores    (Fig. 32, _E_) are set free. The columella remains unchanged, and    some of the spores often remain sticking to it (Fig. 32, _D_).    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--_A_, common black mould (_Mucor_), x 5. _B_,  three nearly ripe spore cases, x 25. _C_, development of the spore  cases, i-iv, x 150; v, x 50. _D_, spore case which has discharged its  spores. _E_, spores, x 300. _F_, a form of _Mucor mucedo_, with small  accessory spore cases, x 5. _G_, the spore cases, x 50. _H_, a single  spore case, x 300. _I_, development of the zygospore of a black mould,  x 45 (after De Bary).]      Spores formed in a manner strongly recalling those of the pond scums    are also known, but only occur after the plants have grown for a    long time, and hence are rarely met with (Fig. 32, _I_).    Another common mould (_M. mucedo_), often growing in company with the  one described, differs from it mainly in the longer stalk of the  sporangium, which is also smaller, and in not forming runners. This  species sometimes bears clusters of very small sporangia attached to  the middle of the ordinary sporangial"]]]
