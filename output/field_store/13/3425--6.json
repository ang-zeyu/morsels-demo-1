When the performance was over, and the audience was dispersing, Kit felt  a hand laid upon his shoulder.    He turned and his glance rested upon a man of about forty, with a grave,  serious expression. He was puzzled, for it was not a face that he  remembered to have ever seen before.    \"You don't know me?\" said the stranger.    \"No, sir.\"    \"And yet you have done me a very great service.\"    \"I didn't know it, sir.\"    \"The greatest service that any one person can do to another--you have  saved my life.\"    Then a light dawned upon Kit's mind, and he remembered what Achilles  Henderson had said to him in the morning.    \"Is your name Dupont?\" he asked.    \"Yes; I am Joe Dupont, the clown, whom you saved from a horrible death.  I tell you, when Nero stood there in the ring with his paw on my breast  I gave myself up for lost. I expected to be torn to pieces. It was an  awful moment!\" and the clown shuddered at the picture which his  imagination conjured up. \"Yes, sir; I wouldn't see such another moment  for all the money Barlow is worth. I wonder my hair didn't turn white.\"    \"Excuse me, Mr. Dupont, but I find it hard to think you are Joe Dupont,  the clown,\" said Kit.    \"Why?\"    \"Because you look so grave and sedate.\"    Joe Dupont smiled.    \"I only make a fool of myself in the ring,\" he said. \"Outside you might  take me for a merchant or minister. Indeed, I am a minister's son.\"    \"You a minister's son!\" ejaculated Kit.    \"Yes; you wouldn't think it, would you? I was rather a wild lad, as  minister's sons often are. My poor father tried hard to give me an  education, but my mind wasn't on books or school exercises, and at  sixteen I cut and run.\"    \"Did you join a circus then?\"    \"Not at once. I tried hard to earn my living in different ways. Finally  I struck a circus, and got an engagement as a razorback. When I got  older I began to notice and imitate the clowns, and finally I made up my  mind to become one myself.\"    \"Do you like the business?\"    \"I have to like it. No; I am disgusted with myself often and often. You  can judge from one thing. I have a little daughter, Katy, now eight  years of age. She has never seen me in the ring and never will. I could  never hold up my head in her presence if she had once seen me playing  the fool before an audience.\"    All this surprised Kit. He had been disposed to think that what clowns  were before the public they were in private life also. Now he saw his  mistake.    \"You contribute to the public amusement, Mr. Dupont,\" said Kit.    \"True; but what sort of a life record is it? Suppose in after years Katy  is asked, 'Who was your father?' and is obliged to answer, 'Joe Dupont,  the clown.' But I ought not to grumble. But for you I should have died a  terrible death, and Katy would be fatherless, so I have much to be  thankful for after all.\"    Kit listened to the clown not without surprise. He could hardly realize  that this was the comical man whose grotesque actions and sayings had  convulsed the spectators only an hour before. When he came to think of  it, he felt that he would rather be an acrobat than a clown.          CHAPTER XV.    MR. BICKFORD GOES TO THE CIRCUS.      When Aaron Bickford, balked of his prey, was compelled to get into his  wagon and start for home, he felt uncommonly cross. To begin with, he  was half famished, having harnessed up and set out on what turned out to  be a wild goose chase without breaking his fast. Yet he could have borne  this with comparative equanimity if he had effected the purpose which he  had in view--the capture of his expected apprentice.    But he had been signally defeated. Indeed he had been humiliated in  presence of Kit and William Morris, by being unceremoniously picked up  and tossed over the fence. As William was an Oakford boy, he foresaw  that his discomfiture would soon be known to all his fellow townsmen,  and that public ridicule would be his portion. There seemed no way to  avoid this, unless by begging William to keep silent, and this he could  not bring himself to do, even if the request was likely to be granted.    \"Where's the boy?\" asked his wife, as, after unharnessing his horse, he  went into the house.    \"I don't know where he is,\" answered Bickford, in a surly tone.    \"Didn't you find him?\"    \"Yes, I found him.\"    \"Wouldn't he come back?\"    \"He didn't.\"    \"I'd have made him if I were you.\"    \"Perhaps you would, and then perhaps you wouldn't. Perhaps you  couldn't.\"    \"You don't mean to say, Aaron Bickford, that you let a whippersnapper  like that defy you?\"    \"What could I do against a man eight feet high?\"    \"Goodness, Mr. Bickford, have you been drinking?\" ejaculated his wife.    \"No, I haven't been drinking.\"    \"Do you mean to tell me that boy is eight feet high?\"    \"No, I don't mean to tell you the boy is eight feet high. But I won't  answer any more foolish questions till you give me something to eat. I  am fairly faint with hunger.\"    \"Sit down, then, and I hope after you've gratified your appetite you'll  be a little less mysterious.\"    Mrs. Bickford was privately of opinion that her husband had stopped at  some drinking place--otherwise why should he prate of men eight feet  tall?    Aaron Bickford ate almost ravenously, though the food set before him was  not calculated to gratify the taste of an epicure. But all things are  acceptable to an empty stomach.    When he seemed to be satisfied, his wife began anew.    \"Who is it that is eight feet high?\" she asked.    \"The giant at the circus.\"    \"What did you have to do with him?\"    \"Not much, but he had something to do with me,\" answered Bickford,  grimly.    \"How is that?\"    \"I overhauled the boy, and was dragging him back to the wagon, when this  fellow hove in sight. It seems he knew the young rascal, and took his  part. He seized me as easily as you would take up a cat, and flung me  over the fence.\"    \"I wish I'd been there!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bickford, angrily.    \"What could you have done. You would have been flung over too,\" said her  husband, contemptuously.    \"I would have got a good grip of his hair, and I guess that would have  made him let go.\"    \"You'd have to stand on a ladder, then.\"    \"So the boy got away?\"    \"Of course he did.\"    \"And where did he go?\"    \"I expect he went to the circus along with William Morris.\"    \"Was that boy with him?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"They were pretty well matched. What can they do at the circus?\"    \"I don't know. Perhaps their long-legged friend will give them a ticket  to the show.\"    \"Aaron, suppose we go to the circus?\"    \"What for?\"    \"You may get hold of the boy, and bring him back. The giant won't be  with him all the time.\"    \"I'd like to get the boy back,\" said Bickford, in a wavering tone. \"I'd  give him a lesson.\"    \"And so would I. I guess between us we could subdue him. But of course  he must be got back first.\"    \"I'll think of it, Sarah.\"    Later in the day Mr. Bickford told his wife he would go to the circus,  but he tried to evade taking her in order to save the expense of another  ticket. To this, however, she would not agree. The upshot was, that  after supper the old horse was harnessed up, and the amiable pair, bent  on vengeance, started for Grafton.          CHAPTER XVI.    MR. BICKFORD AT THE CIRCUS.      Mr. Bickford's chief object in going to the circus was to regain  possession of Kit, his runaway apprentice, as he chose to consider him.  But, besides this, he really had a curiosity to see the show, and  thought this would afford him a good excuse for doing so. The same  remark will apply to Mrs. Bickford, whose curiosity had been excited the  year previous by seeing a circus procession. The blacksmith and his wife  were not prejudiced against amusements, like many others, but were too  frugal to attend them. Now that they could combine business with  pleasure, they threw to the winds all hesitation.    \"Do you think you'll get the boy, father?\" asked Mrs. Bickford, as they  jolted over the road to Grafton.    \"I'll make a try for it, Sarah. He's a good strong boy, and he'll make a  capital blacksmith. Did you notice his broad shoulders?\"    \"He looks like he'd have a hearty appetite,\" said the careful spouse.    \"We won't pamper him, Sarah,\" replied Bickford, smiling grimly. \"He  won't get no such victuals as he did at home. Plain food and plenty of  it, that's the way to bring up boys.\"    \"Perhaps he won't be at the circus,\" suggested Mrs. Bickford.    \"I'd be surprised if he wasn't. Boys have a natural hankering for the  circus. I had when I was a boy.\"    \"Did you ever go, Aaron?\"    \"No; I didn't have the money.\"    \"Do you know how much they charge?\"    \"Fifty cents, I believe.\"    \"It's an awful sight of money to pay for amusement. If it lasts two  hours, that makes twenty-five cents an hour.\"    \"So it does, Sarah. That's as much as I can earn by hard work in that  time.\"    \"I don't know as it's right to fling away so much money.\"    \"I wouldn't do it if it wasn't for gettin' the boy back. He'll be worth  a good deal to me if I do. He's a good deal stronger than Bill Morris.\"    \"Of course that makes a difference. I don't care so much for the circus,  though I should like to see the man stand up on a horse and jump through  hoops. I wonder if the horse jumps through too.\"    \"I don't know, but we'll soon know all that is to be known. The boy  won't expect to see us, I reckon,\" concluded the blacksmith, with a  chuckle.    At length they reached the circus grounds. All was bustle and excitement  in the neighborhood of the lot.    \"I declare, Aaron, it looks like Fourth of July,\" said Mrs. Bickford.    \"So it does. It beats all--what a crowd there is.\"    They bought tickets and entered the inclosure."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22522"],[0,"Artists' Wives (#11)"],[1,"of the singular  household. On the contrary, the more they live, the merrier they are.  Last winter they changed quarters three times, were sold up once, and  notwithstanding all this, gave two large fancy balls!    [Illustration: p145-156]    [Illustration: p146-157]    [Illustration: p149-160]          FRAGMENT OF A WOMAN'S LETTER FOUND IN THE RUE NOTRE-DAME-DES-CHAMPS    ... What it has cost me to marry an artist! Oh, my dear! if I had known!  but young girls have singular ideas about so many things. Just imagine  that at the Exhibition, when I read in the catalogue the addresses of  far-away quiet streets at the further end of Paris, I pictured to myself  peaceable, stay-at-home lives, devoted to work and the family circle,  and I said to myself (feeling beforehand a certainty that I should be  dreadfully jealous), \"That is the sort of husband to suit me. He will  always be with me. We shall spend our days together; he at his picture  or sculpture, while I read or sew beside him, in the concentrated light  of the studio.\" Poor dear innocent! I had not the faintest idea then  what a studio really was, nor of the singular creatures one meets there.  Never, in gazing at those statues of bold undressed goddesses had the  idea occurred to me that there were women daring enough to--and that  even I myself----. Otherwise, I can assure you I should never have  married a sculptor. No, indeed, most decidedly not! I must own, they  were all against this marriage at home; notwithstanding my husband's  fortune, his already famous name, and the fine house he was having built  for us two. It was I alone who would have it so. He was so elegant, so  charming, so eager. I thought, however, he meddled a little too much  about my dress, and the arrangement of my hair: \"Do your hair like this;  so,\" and he would amuse himself by placing a flower in the midst of  my curls with far greater skill than any one of our milliners. So much  experience in a man was alarming, wasn't it? I ought to have distrusted  him. Well, you will see. Listen.    [Illustration: p151-162]    We returned from our honeymoon. While I was busy settling myself in my  pretty and charmingly furnished rooms, that paradise you know so well,  my husband, from the moment of his arrival, had set to work and spent  the days at his studio, which was away from the house. When he returned  in the evening, he would talk to me with feverish eagerness of his next  subject for exhibition.    [Illustration: p152-163]    The subject was \"a Roman lady leaving the bath.\" He wanted the marble  to reproduce that faint shiver of the skin at the contact of air, the  moisture of the delicate textures clinging to the shoulders, and all  sorts of other fine things which I no longer remember. Between you and  me, when he speaks to me of his sculpture, I do-not always understand  him very well. However, I used to say confidently: \"It will be very  pretty,\" and already I saw myself treading the finely sanded walks  admiring my husband's work, a beautiful marble sculpture gleaming white  against the green hangings; while behind me I heard whispered: \"the wife  of the sculptor.\"    [Illustration: p153-164]    At last one day, curious to see how our Roman lady was getting on, the  idea occurred to me, to go and take him by surprise in his studio, which  I had not yet visited. It was one of the first times I had gone out  alone, and I had made myself very smart, I can tell you. When I arrived,  I found the door of the little garden leading to the ground floor, wide  open. So I walked straight in; and, conceive my indignation, when I  beheld my husband in a white smock like a stone mason, with ruffled  hair, hands grimed with clay, and in front of him, upright on a  platform, a woman, my dear, a great creature, almost undressed,  and looking just as composed in this airy costume as though it were  perfectly natural.    [Illustration: p154-165]    Her wretched clothes covered with mud, thick walking boots, and a round  hat trimmed with a feather out of curl, were thrown beside her on a  chair. All this I saw in an instant, for you may imagine how I fled.  Etienne would have spoken to me--detained me; but with a gesture of  horror at the clay-covered hands, I rushed off to mama, and reached her  barely alive. You can imagine my appearance.    [Illustration: p155-166]    \"Good heavens, dear child! what is the matter?\"    I related to mama what I had seen, where this dreadful woman was, and  in what costume. And I cried, and cried. My mother, much moved, tried to  console me, explained to me that it must have been a model.    \"What! but it is abominable; no one ever told me about that before I was  married!\"    Hereupon Etienne arrived, greatly distressed, and tried in his turn to  make me understand that a model is not a woman like other women, and  that besides sculptors cannot get on without them; but these reasons  had no effect upon me, and I stoutly declared I would have nothing to  do with a husband who spent his days _tete-a-tete_ with young ladies in  such a costume.    \"Come, my dear Etienne,\" said poor mama, trying hard to arrange  everything peaceably, \"could you not out of respect for your wife's  feelings, replace this creature by a dummy, a lay figure?\"    My husband bit his moustaches furiously.    \"Quite impossible, dear mother.\"    \"Still, my dear, it seems to me--a bright idea! milliners have  pasteboard heads on which they trim bonnets. Well, what can be done for  a head, could it not be done for----?\" It seems this is not possible.    At least, this was what Etienne tried to demonstrate at great length,  with all sorts of details and technical words. He really looked very  unhappy. I watched him out of the corner of my eye while I dried my  tears, and I saw that my grief affected him deeply. At last, after  an endless discussion, it was agreed that since the model was  indispensable, I should be there whenever she came. There chanced to  be on one side of the studio a very convenient little lumber-room, from  which I could see without being seen. I ought to be ashamed, you will  say, of being jealous of such kind of creatures, and of showing my  jealousy. But, my pet, you must have gone through these emotions before  you can offer an opinion about them.    Next day, the model was to be there. I therefore summoned up my courage,  and installed myself in my hiding-place, with the express condition that  at the least tap at the partition my husband should come to me at once.  Scarcely had I shut myself in, when the dreadful model I had seen  the other day arrived, dressed Heaven knows how, and so wretched in  appearance, that I asked myself how I could have been jealous of a woman  who could walk abroad without a scrap of white cuff at her wrists,  and in an old shawl with green fringe. Well, my dear, when I saw this  creature throw off shawl and dress in the middle of the studio, and  begin to undress in the coolest and boldest manner, it had an effect  upon me I cannot describe. I choked with rage. I thumped at the  partition. Etienne came to me. I trembled; I was pale. He laughed at me,  gently re-assured me, and returned to his work. By this time the woman  was standing up, half-naked, her thick hair loosened and hanging down  her back in glossy heaviness. It was no longer the poor wretch of a  moment ago, but already almost a statue, notwithstanding her common and  listless air. My heart died within me. However, I said nothing. All at  once, I heard my husband cry: \"The left leg; the left leg forward.\" And  as the model did not understand him at once, he went to her, and--Oh! I  could contain myself no longer. I knocked. He did not hear me. I knocked  again, furiously. This time he ran to me, frowning a little at being  disturbed in the heat of work. \"Come, Armande, do be reasonable!\"  Bathed in tears, I leant my head upon his shoulder, and sobbed out: \"I  can't bear it, my dear, I can't; indeed, I can't!\"    [Illustration: p159-170]    At this, without answering me, he went sharply into the studio, and made  a sign to that horror of a woman, who dressed herself and departed.    For several days, Etienne did not return to the studio. He remained  at home with me, would not go out, refused even to see his friends;  otherwise he was quite kind and gentle, but he had such a melancholy  air. Once I asked him timidly: \"You are not working any more?\" which  earned me this reply: \"One can't work without a model.\" I had not the  courage to pursue the subject, for I felt how much I was to blame,  and that he had a right to be vexed with me. Nevertheless, by dint of  caresses and endearments, I cajoled him into returning to his studio and  trying to finish the statue--how do they say it? out of his head, from  imagination, in short, by mama's process. To me, this seemed quite  feasible; but it gave the poor fellow endless trouble. Every evening  he came in, with irritated nerves and more and more discouraged; almost  ill, indeed. To cheer him up, I used often to go and see him. I always  said: \"It is charming.\" But, as a fact, the statue made no progress  whatever. I don't even know if he worked at it. When I arrived, I would  find him always smoking on his divan, or perhaps, rolling up pellets of  clay, which he angrily threw against the opposite wall.    One afternoon, when I was gazing at the unfortunate Roman lady, who,  half modelled, had been so long in stepping out of her bath, an idea  occurred to me. The Roman lady was about the same figure as myself;  perhaps at a pinch I might----    \"What do you mean by a well-turned leg?\" I asked my husband suddenly.    He explained it to me at great length, showing me all that was still  lacking to his statue, and which he could by no means give it without a  model. Poor fellow! He had such a heart-broken air as he said this. Do  you know what I did? Well, I bravely picked up the drapery which was  lying in a corner, I went "]]]
