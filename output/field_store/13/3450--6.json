A few yards in front of  us two beaked Afro-Hebrews were arguing as to what the hero's  leavings had been.    'What did he die worth?' was to one of them a subject of earnest  enquiry. A few yards in front of them again, as we passed, some  bar-loungers foregathered. 'He stood no nonsense about niggers,'  one was saying as we went by him. Edgar nudged me. 'We all have  our different views of him,' he said, 'haven't we? He gave us  views and visions. Thank God that he distrusted himself, and sent  us straight to learn where he learned, haply to learn what he  missed learning from Oxford, his Mistress of Vision, so far to  the west and the north.'    'You see, it's this way,' he said, when the place had grown quiet  again in the drowsy noonday. They had gone off then, the  Jo'burgers, three wagonettes and a motor-car crowded with them.  'We must keep the road open to the north, mustn't we?---the way  his feet lie, the way that goes beyond his vision into bigger  visions.'    'I'll try and do something,' I said humbly. 'There are plenty who  want to travel far, or think they do.' I glanced at the three  Mashonas by the fire. One was teaching the other two. They were  spelling out Saint John's Gospel together. 'Is he one of the most  adventurous?' Edgar asked. 'He's very willing,' I muttered. 'You  ask him whether he'd like to go to school down south.'    The boy's face lighted up when Edgar asked him. It was a rounded,  soft-featured Mashona face with large bright eyes. The lips were  not so very thick; the nostrils were cut like an Arab's.    'Tell him I'll pay for him and for another who wants to go,'  Edgar said. 'He's probably got a particular friend. What about  Atiwagoni?' 'He might be keen to go,' I said, 'and he's quicker  than most of them.'    We began to smoke a last pipe silently. The time was drawing near  to strike our camp. We must start for Bulawayo at once if we  would catch Edgar's midnight train easily.    I reached for my wallet, and brought out an Oxford anthology.    I turned over the pages and began to read rather sadly    Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,  To laugh as he sits by the river,  Making a poet out of a man:  The true gods sigh for the cost and the pain  For the reed which grows nevermore again  As a reed with the reeds in the river.    'There's that point of view to consider,' I said. 'I'm fond of  Arcadia and Arcadians, and there's loss entailed if you send  Arcadians on the way of Athens.' Edgar sighed. 'I know what you  mean,' said he; 'and I feel it as you do. But Arcadia's got  Lacedaemon at her throat, a southern state not much troubled with  scruples, neither very philosophic nor very literary. The way has  been opened by him we wot of to Oxford, to the Athens of the  north. It was opened, as men thought, for the benefit of young  Lacedaemonians. The man that was hand-in-glove with Africanders,  with our Lacedaemonians of the south, did that. He imperiled  Lacedaemonian stability by opening the way to northern stars and  their influences to Shelley, Burke, and Mill, and to all manner  of people dangerous to the back-veld views of Lacedaemon. He  opened the way to Tolstoy's rediscovery of the Christian Law,  amongst other northern treasures, didn't he? And I, with the  Arcadian taint in my veins, saw the way open and went northwards.  Now it has come to pass that I remember my own people as Moses  did, and use the wisdom of Oxford as he used the wisdom of Egypt,  to help one's own people towards a promised land. They want  leaders, don't they? Is there not a cause? Is it healthy for  Lacedaemon to go on as she does in Arcadia, setting aside  Arcadia's own happiness?' 'I'll be back again next year,' Edgar  said, 'to compare notes and report progress, should all fall  well. If I forget thee, O my Darien-peak, let my right hand  forget her cunning!' We knelt long at the grave with the feet of  its sleeper laid true north; then we said 'Good-bye' to it.  'Bless him,' Edgar said to me as we turned away.' He opened a  wider way than he knew perchance; God prosper the Great North  Road, the Road to Oxford rather than to Cairo!'        THE LEPER WINDOWS        Its Cathedral was rising at last in a small South African  capital. For many years a pro-Cathedral of corrugated iron had  sufficed. Now the first stage of a noble design in ruddy  sandstone was all but completed.    The new Bishop who had been called to sit in its Cape-oak throne  was complacent of its charms. Chancel and Lady-chapel were  provided; transepts and tower might be expected in due course of  time. The Bishop was long and lean and dark-haired, very closely  shaven. He came from Oxford, yet he was wise enough to obtrude  that fact but seldom on South Africa. He watched and listened  intently and said strangely little; nevertheless, when he did  speak, he seemed to have no lack of things to say. His speech to  the Cathedral Building Committee after a three months' silence  was not without its interest. He spoke well of both design and  execution.    He turned to the shyer subject of the raising of the funds. How  had they attained to such wealth as their secretary announced?  Mainly by means of three fancy fairs and a cafe chantant. Alas!  that it should be so. Yet he did not propose to hold inquests.  Let the dead bury their dead! Let them, however, set their hearts  as the nether millstone against the adding of transept or tower  save only by alms made to God. He went on to ask with whose  memory the Lady-chapel was to be associated. Was it not the fact  that they had associated the chapel of Christ's Mother with the  memory of a visionary statesman? There seemed to be want of  consideration for the great dead shown in their popular decision,  inasmuch as he had not seen his way to accept her Son. Was it not  something of a felony to have stolen the dead man's name--a  felony that had assisted their funds very lavishly? But, likely  enough, the Committee had had some noble thought in mind when  they gave to the dead such reckless honor. The last touches were  now being given to the nave. He wished to make a personal request  of his own. He understood that colored persons and natives were  not to be encouraged to frequent this mother of churches. Their  status within was, to say the least, precarious and hard to  reconcile with due respect for the second chapter of Saint James.  He asked to put in at his own expense five windows after the  likeness of leper windows in England windows that colored persons  and natives might use freely and without reproach. By this means  someone at least of them from without the walls might be made  free of the vision of the services within.    The irony of the speech escaped its hearers for the most part.  After the usual type of debate on such a subject as viewed in  South African Church circles, the request was granted.    Now it happened that Mr. Conyers Smythe, the most prosperous man  in the whole community, was not present at that Committee  meeting. He was a Master of Arts of a South African University,  and a real scholar, not a mere qualifier. He was, moreover, both  sufficiently educated to understand the irony of a critical  friend, and habitually inclined to resent it. He spoke fierily to  certain of his intimates when the Bishop's speech was reported to  him. He went to see him himself next day in the evening time.    His host came and sat with him on the stoep, lighted the lamp to  show him a new book of his, and gave him coffee and a cigar. The  hour was about half-past seven, and the week was Christmas week.  There was a new moon of very dim silver in the West looking  through the rose trellis upon them, and masses of inflammatory  cloud were heaped about her. The host looked at the guest  meditatively as he lighted his pipe.    The guest was fair-haired and well-featured, as well as  magnificently built; but his deep color was not exactly the hue  of health. His eyes had been glowing when he had first come on  the scene, prepared to open battle. But when his host masterfully  gained an armistice they became dull and rather worn eyes, that  seemed not to be seeing good days somehow.    Their possessor only grew eager by flashes now and again as the  Bishop showed him a second new book one that they both deemed  highly delectable turning the passages and discussing various  phases of its general subject the cults of the Greek States.    They had come together, these two, in a very tiny and remote city  each an enthusiast as to this same by-path of erudition.    It was not until he had shown his guest the road on to a large  extent of commonage--commonage of mutual delight that the Bishop  led the way to a spot therein convenient for the desired  engagement. He began to discuss the relations of Xanthos, the  fair god, and Melanthos, the dark god, in Hellenic society.    'That's the trouble here,' he said. 'I hope you won't draw the  line even at my leper windows. They may at least ease the  isolation of our two cults here. I find established so to speak  in this Christian city the cult of Xanthos, tribal god of the  fair-skins at the Cathedral, or for the present the Pro-Cathedral.  Also I find the cult of Melanthos multiplying itself at the tin  temple of Saint Simon the Cyrenian.'    Mr. Smythe's cheeks became more deeply empurpled and his eyes  danced.    'You must know,' went on the Bishop, 'I don't believe in  tribal-gods at this time of day. I believe in Someone bigger. So  it was that leper windows, modeled on those of the Middle Ages,  seemed to me possible easements. There, at least, Lazarus may feel  at home and join in worship, as his forerunners in the Middle  Ages did, at their own wall-slits. Thus at least one step will  be taken towards the supercession of Xanthos. As to the cult  of Melanthos, I hope to help to infuse more of the joy of the  Universal into it, so help me God!!! Yes, let me hear your  objections.'    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22914"],[0,"The Sceptical Chymist (#11)"],[1,"not necessary to the  Constitution of such a Sulphur as ours, I could easily manifest, if I  would acquaint you with the several wayes by which I have obtain'd,  though not in such plenty, a Sulphur of Antimony, colour'd and  combustible like common Brimstone. And though I am not now minded to  discover them, yet I shall tell you, that to satisfie some Ingenious  Men, that distill'd Vitriolate Spirits are not necessary to the  obtaining of such a Sulphur as we have been considering, I did by the  bare distillation of only Spirit of Nitre, from its weight of crude  Antimony separate, in a short time, a yellow and very inflamable  Sulphur, which, for ought I know, deserves as much the name of an  Element, as any thing that Chymists are wont to separate from any  Mineral by the Fire. I could perhaps tell you of other Operations upon  Antimony, whereby That may be extracted from it, which cannot be  forc'd out of it by the Fire; but I shall reserve them for a fitter  Opportunity, and only annex at present this sleight, but not  impertinent Experiment. That whereas I lately observed to you, that  the Urinous and common Salts whereof _Sal Armoniack_ consists,  remain'd unsever'd by the Fire in many successive Sublimations, they  may be easily separated, and partly without any Fire at all, by  pouring upon the Concrete finely powder'd, a Solution of Salt of  Tartar, or of the Salt of Wood-Ashes; for upon your diligently mixing  of these you will finde your Nose invaded with a very strong smell of  Urine, and perhaps too your Eyes forc'd to water by the same subtle  and piercing Body that produces the stink; both these effects  proceeding from hence, that by the Alcalizate Salt, the Sea Salt that  enter'd the composition of the _Sal Armoniack_ is mortify'd and made  more fixt, and thereby a divorce is made between it and the volatile  Urinous Salt, which being at once set at liberty, and put into motion,  begins presently to fly away, and to offend the Nostrils and Eyes it  meets with by the way. And if the operation of these Salts be in  convenient Glasses promoted by warmth, though but by that of a Bath,  the ascending Steams may easily be caught and reduc'd into a penetrant  Spirit, abounding with a Salt, which I have sometimes found to be  separable in a Crystalline Form. I might add to these Instances, that  whereas Sublimate, consisting, as you know, of Salts & Quicksilver  combin'd and carried up together by Heat, may be Sublim'd, I know not  how often, by a like degree of Fire, without suffering any divorce of  the component Bodies, the Mercury may be easily sever'd from the  adhering Salts, if the Sublimate be distill'd from Salt of Tartar,  Quick Lime, or such Alcalizate Bodies. But I will rather observe to  you, _Eleutherius_, what divers ingenious men have thought somewhat  strange; that by such an Additament that seems but only to promote the  Separation, there may be easily obtain'd from a Concrete that by the  Fire alone is easily divisible into all the Elements that Vegetables  are suppos'd to consist of, such a similar Substance as differs in  many respects from them all, and consequently has by many of the most  Intelligent Chymists been denied to be contain'd in the mixt Body. For  I know a way, and have practis'd it, whereby common Tartar, without  the addition of any thing that is not perfectly a Mineral except  Salt-petre, may by one Distillation in an Earthen Retort be made to  afford good store of real Salt, readily dissoluble in water, which I  found to be neither acid, nor of the smell of Tartar, and to be almost  as volatile as Spirit of Wine it self, and to be indeed of so  differing a Nature from all that is wont to be separated by Fire from  Tartar, that divers Learned Men, with whom I discours'd of it, could  hardly be brought to beleeve, that so fugitive a Salt could be  afforded by Tartar, till I assur'd it them upon my own Knowledge. And  if I did not think you apt to suspect me to be rather too backward  than too forward to credit or affirm unlikely things, I could convince  you by what I have yet lying by me of that anomalous Salt.    [Footnote 4: Lib. 1. Observat. Cap. 6.]    The Fourth thing that I shall alledge to countenance my first  Consideration is, That the Fire even when it divides a Body into  Substances of divers Consistences, does not most commonly analyze it  into Hypostatical Principles, but only disposes its parts into new  Textures, and thereby produces Concretes of a new indeed, but yet of a  compound Nature. This Argument it will be requisite for me to  prosecute so fully hereafter, that I hope you will then confess that  'tis not for want of good Proofs that I desire leave to suspend my  Proofs till the _Series_ of my Discourse shall make it more proper and  seasonable to propose them.    It may be further alledg'd on the behalf of my First Consideration,  That some such distinct Substances may be obtain'd from some  Concretes without Fire, as deserve no less the name of Elementary,  than many that Chymists extort by the Violence of the Fire.    We see that the Inflamable Spirit, or as the Chymists esteem it, the  Sulphur of Wine, may not only be separated from it by the gentle heat  of a Bath, but may be distill'd either by the help of the Sun-Beams,  or even of a Dunghill, being indeed of so Fugitive a Nature, that it  is not easy to keep it from flying away, even without the Application  of external heat. I have likewise observ'd that a Vessel full of Urine  being plac'd in a Dunghill, the Putrefaction is wont after some weeks  so to open the Body, that the parts disbanding the Saline Spirit, will  within no very long time, if the Vessel be not stopt, fly away of it  self; Insomuch that from such Urine I have been able to distill little  or nothing else than a nauseous Phlegme, instead of the active and  piercing Salt and Spirit that it would have afforded, when first  expos'd to the Fire, if the Vessel had been carefully stopt.    And this leads me to consider in the Fifth place, That it will be very  hard to prove, that there can no other Body or way be given which  will as well as the Fire divide Concretes into several homogeneous  Substances, which may consequently be call'd their Elements or  Principles, as well as those separated or produc'd by the Fire. For  since we have lately seen, that Nature can successefully employ other  Instruments than the Fire to separate distinct Substances from mixt  Bodies, how know we, but that Nature has made, or Art may make, some  such Substance as may be a fit Instrument to Analyze mixt Bodies, or  that some such Method may be found by Humane Industry or Luck, by  whose means compound Bodies may be resolv'd into other Substances,  than such as they are wont to be divided into by the Fire. And why the  Products of such an _Analysis_ may not as justly be call'd the  component Principles of the Bodies that afford them, it will not be  easy to shew, especially since I shall hereafter make it evident, that  the Substances which Chymists are wont to call the Salts, and  Sulphurs, and Mercuries of Bodies, are not so pure and Elementary as  they presume, and as their _Hypothesis_ requires. And this may  therefore be the more freely press'd upon the Chymists, because  neither the _Paracelsians_, nor the _Helmontians_ can reject it  without apparent Injury to their respective Masters. For _Helmont_  do's more than once Inform his Readers, that both _Paracelsus_ and  Himself were Possessors of the famous Liquor, _Alkahest_, which for  its great power in resolving Bodies irresoluble by Vulgar Fires, he  somewhere seems to call _Ignis Gehennae_. To this Liquor he ascribes,  (and that in great part upon his own Experience) such wonders, that if  we suppose them all true, I am so much the more a Friend to Knowledge  than to Wealth, that I should think the _Alkahest_ a nobler and more  desireable Secret than the Philosophers Stone it self. Of this  Universal Dissolvent he relates, That having digested with it for a  competent time a piece of Oaken Charcoal, it was thereby reduc'd into  a couple of new and distinct Liquors, discriminated from each other by  their Colour and Situation, and that the whole body of the Coal was  reduc'd into those Liquors, both of them separable from his Immortal  _Menstruum_, which remain'd as fit for such Operations as before. And  he moreover tells us in divers places of his Writings, that by this  powerful, and unwearied Agent, he could dissolve Metals, Marchasites,  Stones, Vegetable and Animal Bodies of what kinde soever, and even  Glass it self (first reduc'd to powder,) and in a word, all kinds of  mixt Bodies in the World into their several similar Substances,  without any Residence or _Caput mortuum_. And lastly, we may gather  this further from his Informations, That the homogeneous Substances  obtainable from compound Bodies by his piercing Liquor, were  oftentimes different enough both as to Number and as to Nature, from  those into which the same Bodies are wont to be divided by common  Fire. Of which I shall need in this place to mention no other proof,  then that whereas we know that in our common _Analysis_ of a mixt  Body, there remains a terrestrial and very fixt Substance, oftentimes  associated with a Salt as fixt; Our Author tells us, that by his way  he could Distill over all Concretes without any _Caput mortuum_, and  consequently could make those parts of the Concrete volatile, which in  the Vulgar _Analysis_ would have been fixt. So that if our Chymists  will not reject the solemn and repeated Testimony of a Person, who  cannot but be acknowledg'd for one of the greatest Spagyrists that  they can boast of, they must not deny that there is to be found in  Nature another Agent able to Analyze compound Bodies less violently,  and both more genuinely and more universally than the Fire. And for my  own part, though I cannot but say on this Occasion what (you know) our  Friend Mr."]]]
