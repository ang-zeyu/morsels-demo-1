Therefore she was quite willing, at the age of ten, to go into  her father's business as his chief assistant.    As the years went by she developed a decided talent for business, so  that her father could safely leave all his affairs in her hands if he  had to go out of town. Her devotion, ability, and tireless energy made  her, in time, indispensable. My grandfather was obliged to admit that  the little learning she had stolen was turned to good account, when he  saw how well she could keep his books, and how smoothly she got along  with Russian and Polish customers. Perhaps that was the argument that  induced him, after obstinate years, to remove his veto from my  mother's petitions and let her take up lessons again. For while piety  was my grandfather's chief concern on the godly side, on the worldly  side he set success in business above everything.    My mother was fifteen years old when she entered on a career of higher  education. For two hours daily she was released from the store, and in  that interval she strove with might and main to conquer the world  of knowledge. Katrina Petrovna, her teacher, praised and encouraged  her; and there was no reason why the promising pupil should not have  developed into a young lady of culture, with Madame teaching Russian,  German, crocheting, and singing--yes, out of a book, to the  accompaniment of a clavier--all for a fee of seventy-five kopecks a  week.        [Illustration: THE WOOD MARKET, POLOTZK]    Did I say there was no reason? And what about the marriage broker?  Hannah Hayye, the only daughter of Raphael the Russian, going on  sixteen, buxom, bright, capable, and well educated, could not escape  the eye of the shadchan. A fine thing it would be to let such a likely  girl grow old over a book! To the canopy with her, while she could  fetch the highest price in the marriage market!    My mother was very unwilling to think of marriage at this time. She  had nothing to gain by marriage, for already she had everything that  she desired, especially since she was permitted to study. While her  father was rather stern, her mother spoiled and petted her; and she  was the idol of her aunt Hode, the fiddler's wife.    Hode had bought a fine estate in Polotzk, after my grandfather settled  there, and made it her home whenever she became tired of travelling.  She lived in state, with many servants and dependents, wearing silk  dresses on week days, and setting silver plate before the meanest  guest. The women of Polotzk were breathless over her wardrobe,  counting up how many pairs of embroidered boots she had, at fifteen  rubles a pair. And Hode's manners were as much a subject of gossip as  her clothes, for she had picked up strange ways in her travels  Although she was so pious that she was never tempted to eat trefah, no  matter if she had to go hungry, her conduct in other respects was not  strictly orthodox. For one thing, she was in the habit of shaking  hands with men, looking them straight in the face. She spoke Russian  like a Gentile, she kept a poodle, and she had no children.    Nobody meant to blame the rich woman for being childless, because it  was well known in Polotzk that Hode the Russian, as she was called,  would have given all her wealth for one scrawny baby. But she was to  blame for voluntarily exiling herself from Jewish society for years at  a time, to live among pork-eaters, and copy the bold ways of Gentile  women. And so while they pitied her childlessness, the women of  Polotzk regarded her misfortune as perhaps no more than a due  punishment.    Hode, poor woman, felt a hungry heart beneath her satin robes. She  wanted to adopt one of my grandmother's children, but my grandmother  would not hear of it. Hode was particularly taken with my mother, and  my grandmother, in compassion, loaned her the child for days at a  time; and those were happy days for both aunt and niece. Hode would  treat my mother to every delicacy in her sumptuous pantry, tell her  wonderful tales of life in distant parts, show her all her beautiful  dresses and jewels, and load her with presents.    As my mother developed into girlhood, her aunt grew more and more  covetous of her. Following a secret plan, she adopted a boy from the  poorhouse, and brought him up with every advantage that money could  buy. My mother, on her visits, was thrown a great deal into this boy's  society, but she liked him less than the poodle. This grieved her  aunt, who cherished in her heart the hope that my mother would marry  her adopted son, and so become her daughter after all. And in order  to accustom her to think well of the match, Hode dinned the boy's name  in my mother's ears day and night, praising him and showing him off.  She would open her jewel boxes and take out the flashing diamonds,  heavy chains, and tinkling bracelets, dress my mother in them in front  of the mirror, telling her that they would all be hers--all her  own--when she became the bride of Mulke.    My mother still describes the necklace of pearls and diamonds which  her aunt used to clasp around her plump throat, with a light in her  eyes that is reminiscent of girlish pleasure. But to all her aunt's  teasing references to the future, my mother answered with a giggle and  a shake of her black curls, and went on enjoying herself, thinking  that the day of judgment was very, very far away. But it swooped down  on her sooner than she expected--the momentous hour when she must  choose between the pearl necklace with Mulke and a penniless stranger  from Yuchovitch who was reputed to be a fine scholar.    Mulke she would not have even if all the pearls in the ocean came with  him. The boy was stupid and unteachable, and of unspeakable origin.  Picked up from the dirty floor of the poorhouse, his father was  identified as the lazy porter who sometimes chopped a cord of wood for  my grandmother; and his sisters were slovenly housemaids scattered  through Polotzk. No, Mulke was not to be considered. But why consider  anybody? Why think of a _hossen_ at all, when she was so content? My  mother ran away every time the shadchan came, and she begged to be  left as she was, and cried, and invoked her mother's support. But her  mother, for the first time in her history, refused to take the  daughter's part. She joined the enemy--the family and the  shadchan--and my mother saw that she was doomed.    Of course she submitted. What else could a dutiful daughter do, in  Polotzk? She submitted to being weighed, measured, and appraised  before her face, and resigned herself to what was to come.    When that which was to come did come, she did not recognize it. She  was all alone in the store one day, when a beardless young man, in top  boots that wanted grease, and a coat too thin for the weather, came in  for a package of cigarettes. My mother climbed up on the counter, with  one foot on a shelf, to reach down the cigarettes. The customer gave  her the right change, and went out. And my mother never suspected that  that was the proposed hossen, who came to look her over and see if she  was likely to last. For my father considered himself a man of  experience now, this being his second match, and he was determined to  have a hand in this affair himself.    No sooner was the hossen out of the store than his mother, also  unknown to the innocent storekeeper, came in for a pound of tallow  candles. She offered a torn bill in payment, and my mother accepted it  and gave change; showing that she was wise enough in money matters to  know that a torn bill was good currency.    After the woman there shuffled in a poor man evidently from the  country, who, in a shy and yet challenging manner, asked for a package  of cheap tobacco. My mother produced the goods with her usual  dispatch, gave the correct change, and stood at attention for more  trade.    Parents and son held a council around the corner, the object of their  espionage never dreaming that she had been put to a triple test and  not found wanting. But in the evening of the same day she was  enlightened. She was summoned to her elder brother's house, for a  conference on the subject of the proposed match, and there she found  the young man who had bought the cigarettes. For my mother's family,  if they forced her to marry, were willing to make her path easier by  letting her meet the hossen, convinced that she must be won over by  his good looks and learned conversation.    It does not really matter how my mother felt, as she sat, with a  protecting niece in her lap, at one end of a long table, with the  hossen fidgeting at the other end. The marriage contract would be  written anyway, no matter what she thought of the hossen. And the  contract was duly written, in the presence of the assembled families  of both parties, after plenty of open discussion, in which everybody  except the prospective bride and groom had a voice.    One voice in particular broke repeatedly into the consultations of the  parents and the shadchan, and that was the voice of Henne Roesel, one  of my father's numerous poor cousins. Henne Roesel was not unknown to  my mother. She often came to the store, to beg, under pretence of  borrowing, a little flour or sugar or a stick of cinnamon. On the  occasion of the betrothal she had arrived late, dressed in  indescribable odds and ends, with an artificial red flower stuck into  her frowzy wig. She pushed and elbowed her way to the middle of the  table, where the shadchan sat ready with paper and ink to take down  the articles of the contract. On every point she had some comment to  make, till a dispute arose over a note which my grandfather offered as  part of the dowry, the hossen's people insisting on cash. No one  insisted so loudly as the cousin with the red flower in her wig; and  when the other cousins seemed about to weaken and accept the note,  Red-Flower stood up and exhorted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20897"],[0,"A Short History of England (#11)"],[1,"1750 to 1850, noting  how one died of small-pox, another of old age, another by a curious  accident of decapitation, and throughout all his record should never  once mention the nature, or even the name, of the French Revolution.          VII    THE PROBLEM OF THE PLANTAGENETS      It is a point of prestige with what is called the Higher Criticism in  all branches to proclaim that certain popular texts and authorities are  \"late,\" and therefore apparently worthless. Two similar events are  always the same event, and the later alone is even credible. This  fanaticism is often in mere fact mistaken; it ignores the most common  coincidences of human life: and some future critic will probably say  that the tale of the Tower of Babel cannot be older than the Eiffel  Tower, because there was certainly a confusion of tongues at the Paris  Exhibition. Most of the mediaeval remains familiar to the modern reader  are necessarily \"late,\" such as Chaucer or the Robin Hood ballads; but  they are none the less, to a wiser criticism, worthy of attention and  even trust. That which lingers after an epoch is generally that which  lived most luxuriantly in it. It is an excellent habit to read history  backwards. It is far wiser for a modern man to read the Middle Ages  backwards from Shakespeare, whom he can judge for himself, and who yet  is crammed with the Middle Ages, than to attempt to read them forwards  from Caedmon, of whom he can know nothing, and of whom even the  authorities he must trust know very little. If this be true of  Shakespeare, it is even truer, of course, of Chaucer. If we really want  to know what was strongest in the twelfth century, it is no bad way to  ask what remained of it in the fourteenth. When the average reader turns  to the \"Canterbury Tales,\" which are still as amusing as Dickens yet as  mediaeval as Durham Cathedral, what is the very first question to be  asked? Why, for instance, are they called Canterbury Tales; and what  were the pilgrims doing on the road to Canterbury? They were, of course,  taking part in a popular festival like a modern public holiday, though  much more genial and leisurely. Nor are we, perhaps, prepared to accept  it as a self-evident step in progress that their holidays were derived  from saints, while ours are dictated by bankers.    It is almost necessary to say nowadays that a saint means a very good  man. The notion of an eminence merely moral, consistent with complete  stupidity or unsuccess, is a revolutionary image grown unfamiliar by its  very familiarity, and needing, as do so many things of this older  society, some almost preposterous modern parallel to give its original  freshness and point. If we entered a foreign town and found a pillar  like the Nelson Column, we should be surprised to learn that the hero on  the top of it had been famous for his politeness and hilarity during a  chronic toothache. If a procession came down the street with a brass  band and a hero on a white horse, we should think it odd to be told that  he had been very patient with a half-witted maiden aunt. Yet some such  pantomime impossibility is the only measure of the innovation of the  Christian idea of a popular and recognized saint. It must especially be  realized that while this kind of glory was the highest, it was also in a  sense the lowest. The materials of it were almost the same as those of  labour and domesticity: it did not need the sword or sceptre, but rather  the staff or spade. It was the ambition of poverty. All this must be  approximately visualized before we catch a glimpse of the great effects  of the story which lay behind the Canterbury Pilgrimage.    The first few lines of Chaucer's poem, to say nothing of thousands in  the course of it, make it instantly plain that it was no case of secular  revels still linked by a slight ritual to the name of some forgotten  god, as may have happened in the pagan decline. Chaucer and his friends  did think about St. Thomas, at least more frequently than a clerk at  Margate thinks about St. Lubbock. They did definitely believe in the  bodily cures wrought for them through St. Thomas, at least as firmly as  the most enlightened and progressive modern can believe in those of Mrs.  Eddy. Who was St. Thomas, to whose shrine the whole of that society is  thus seen in the act of moving; and why was he so important? If there be  a streak of sincerity in the claim to teach social and democratic  history, instead of a string of kings and battles, this is the obvious  and open gate by which to approach the figure which disputed England  with the first Plantagenet. A real popular history should think more of  his popularity even than his policy. And unquestionably thousands of  ploughmen, carpenters, cooks, and yeomen, as in the motley crowd of  Chaucer, knew a great deal about St. Thomas when they had never even  heard of Becket.    It would be easy to detail what followed the Conquest as the feudal  tangle that it was, till a prince from Anjou repeated the unifying  effort of the Conqueror. It is found equally easy to write of the Red  King's hunting instead of his building, which has lasted longer, and  which he probably loved much more. It is easy to catalogue the questions  he disputed with Anselm--leaving out the question Anselm cared most  about, and which he asked with explosive simplicity, as, \"Why was God a  man?\" All this is as simple as saying that a king died of eating  lampreys, from which, however, there is little to learn nowadays, unless  it be that when a modern monarch perishes of gluttony the newspapers  seldom say so. But if we want to know what really happened to England in  this dim epoch, I think it can be dimly but truly traced in the story of  St. Thomas of Canterbury.    Henry of Anjou, who brought fresh French blood into the monarchy,  brought also a refreshment of the idea for which the French have always  stood: the idea in the Roman Law of something impersonal and  omnipresent. It is the thing we smile at even in a small French  detective story; when Justice opens a handbag or Justice runs after a  cab. Henry II. really produced this impression of being a police force  in person; a contemporary priest compared his restless vigilance to the  bird and the fish of scripture whose way no man knoweth. Kinghood,  however, meant law and not caprice; its ideal at least was a justice  cheap and obvious as daylight, an atmosphere which lingers only in  popular phrases about the King's English or the King's highway. But  though it tended to be egalitarian it did not, of itself, tend to be  humanitarian. In modern France, as in ancient Rome, the other name of  Justice has sometimes been Terror. The Frenchman especially is always a  Revolutionist--and never an Anarchist. Now this effort of kings like  Henry II. to rebuild on a plan like that of the Roman Law was not only,  of course, crossed and entangled by countless feudal fancies and  feelings in themselves as well as others, it was also conditioned by  what was the corner-stone of the whole civilization. It had to happen  not only with but within the Church. For a Church was to these men  rather a world they lived in than a building to which they went. Without  the Church the Middle Ages would have had no law, as without the Church  the Reformation would have had no Bible. Many priests expounded and  embellished the Roman Law, and many priests supported Henry II. And yet  there was another element in the Church, stored in its first foundations  like dynamite, and destined in every age to destroy and renew the world.  An idealism akin to impossibilism ran down the ages parallel to all its  political compromises. Monasticism itself was the throwing off of  innumerable Utopias, without posterity yet with perpetuity. It had, as  was proved recurrently after corrupt epochs, a strange secret of getting  poor quickly; a mushroom magnificence of destitution. This wind of  revolution in the crusading time caught Francis in Assissi and stripped  him of his rich garments in the street. The same wind of revolution  suddenly smote Thomas Becket, King Henry's brilliant and luxurious  Chancellor, and drove him on to an unearthly glory and a bloody end.    Becket was a type of those historic times in which it is really very  practical to be impracticable. The quarrel which tore him from his  friend's side cannot be appreciated in the light of those legal and  constitutional debates which the misfortunes of the seventeenth century  have made so much of in more recent history. To convict St. Thomas of  illegality and clerical intrigue, when he set the law of the Church  against that of the State, is about as adequate as to convict St.  Francis of bad heraldry when he said he was the brother of the sun and  moon. There may have been heralds stupid enough to say so even in that  much more logical age, but it is no sufficient way of dealing with  visions or with revolutions. St. Thomas of Canterbury was a great  visionary and a great revolutionist, but so far as England was concerned  his revolution failed and his vision was not fulfilled. We are therefore  told in the text-books little more than that he wrangled with the King  about certain regulations; the most crucial being whether \"criminous  clerks\" should be punished by the State or the Church. And this was  indeed the chief text of the dispute; but to realise it we must  reiterate what is hardest for modern England to understand--the nature  of the Catholic Church when it was itself a government, and the  permanent sense in which it was itself a revolution.    It is always the first fact that escapes notice; and the first fact  about the Church was that it created a machinery of pardon, where the  State could only work with a machinery of punishment. It claimed to be a  divine detective who helped the criminal to escape by a plea of guilty.  It was, therefore, in the very nature of the institution, that when it  did"]]]
