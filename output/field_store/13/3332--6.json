Wayfarer,  your looks displease him, and he blows your brains out with a pistol,  and goes home. What of it?    All these things being done, what would be the result? Nothing.  \"Monseigneur the Prince-President took his customary drive yesterday in  the Champs Elysees, in a caleche _a la Daumont_, drawn by four horses,  accompanied by a single aide-de-camp.\" This is what the newspapers will  say.    He has effaced from the walls Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity; and he  is right. Frenchmen, alas! you are no longer either free,--the  strait-waistcoat is upon you; or equal,--the soldier is everything; or  brothers,--for civil war is brewing under this melancholy peace of a  state of siege.    Emperor? Why not? He has a Maury who is called Sibour; he has a  Fontanes, or, if you prefer it, a _Faciuntasinos_, who is called  Fortoul; he has a Laplace who answers to the name of Leverrier,  although he did not produce the \"_Mecanique Celeste_.\" He will easily  find Esmenards and Luce de Lancivals. His Pius VII is at Rome, in the  cassock of Pius IX. His green uniform has been seen at Strasburg; his  eagle has been seen at Boulogne; his grey riding-coat, did he not wear  it at Ham? Cassock or riding-coat, 'tis all one. Madame de Stael comes  out, of his house. She wrote \"Lelia.\" He smiles on her pending the day  when he will exile her. Do you insist on an archduchess? wait awhile  and he will get one. _Tu, felix Austria, nube._ His Murat is called  Saint-Arnaud; his Talleyrand is called Morny; his Duc d'Enghien is  called Law.    What does he lack then? Nothing; a mere trifle; merely Austerlitz and  Marengo.    Make the best of it; he is Emperor _in petto_; one of these mornings  he will be so in the sun; nothing more is wanting than a trivial  formality, the mere consecration and crowning of his false oath at  Notre-Dame. After that we shall have fine doings. Expect an imperial  spectacle. Expect caprices, surprises, stupefying, bewildering things,  the most unexpected combinations of words, the most fearless cacophony?  Expect Prince Troplong, Duc Maupas, Duc Mimerel, Marquis Leboeuf, Baron  Baroche. Form in line, courtiers; hats off, senators; the stable-door  opens, monseigneur the horse is consul. Gild the oats of his highness  Incitatus.    Everything will be swallowed; the public hiatus will be prodigious. All  the enormities will pass away. The old fly-catchers will disappear and  make room for the swallowers of whales.    To our minds the Empire exists from this moment, and without waiting  for the interlude of the senatus consultum and the comedy of the  plebiscite, we despatch this bulletin to Europe:--    \"The treason of the 2nd of December is delivered of the Empire.    \"The mother and child are indisposed.\"          IX    OMNIPOTENCE      Let us forget this man's origin and his 2nd of December, and look to  his political capacity. Shall we judge him by the eight months he has  reigned? On the one hand look at his power, and on the other at his  acts. What can he do? Everything. What has he done? Nothing. With his  unlimited power a man of genius, in eight months, would have changed  the whole face of France, of Europe, perhaps. He would not, certainly,  have effaced the crime of his starting-point, but he might have covered  it. By dint of material improvements he might have succeeded, perhaps,  in masking from the nation his moral abasement. Indeed, we must admit  that for a dictator of genius the thing was not difficult. A certain  number of social problems, elaborated during these last few years by  several powerful minds, seemed to be ripe, and might receive immediate,  practical solution, to the great profit and satisfaction of the nation.  Of this, Louis Bonaparte does not appear to have had any idea. He has  not approached, he has not had a glimpse of one of them. He has not  even found at the Elysee any old remains of the socialist meditations  of Ham. He has added several new crimes to his first one, and in this  he has been logical. With the exception of these crimes he has produced  nothing. Absolute power, no initiative! He has taken France and does  not know what to do with it. In truth, we are tempted to pity this  eunuch struggling with omnipotence.    It is true, however, that this dictator keeps in motion; let us do him  this justice; he does not remain quiet for an instant; he sees with  affright the gloom and solitude around him; people sing who are afraid  in the dark, but he keeps moving. He makes a fuss, he goes at  everything, he runs after projects; being unable to create, he decrees;  he endeavours to mask his nullity; he is perpetual motion; but, alas!  the wheel turns in empty space. Conversion of _rentes_? Of what profit  has it been to this day? Saving of eighteen millions! Very good: the  annuitants lose them, but the President and the Senate, with their two  endowments, pocket them; the benefit to France is zero. Credit Foncier?  no capital forthcoming. Railways? they are decreed, and then laid  aside. It is the same with all these things as with the working-men's  cities. Louis Bonaparte subscribes, but does not pay. As for the  budget, the budget controlled by the blind men in the Council of State,  and voted by the dumb men in the Corps Legislatif, there is an abyss  beneath it. There was no possible or efficacious budget but a great  reduction in the army: two hundred thousand soldiers left at home, two  hundred millions saved. Just try to touch the army! the soldier, who  would regain his freedom, would applaud, but what would the officer  say? And in reality, it is not the soldier but the officer who is  caressed. Then Paris and Lyons must be guarded, and all the other  cities; and afterwards, when we are Emperor, a little European war must  be got up. Behold the gulf!    If from financial questions we pass to political institutions, oh!  there the neo-Bonapartists flourish abundantly, there are the  creations! Good heavens, what creations! A Constitution in the style of  Ravrio,--we have been examining it,--ornamented with palm-leaves and  swans' necks, borne to the Elysee with old easy-chairs in the carriages  of the _garde-meuble_; the Conservative Senate restitched and regilded,  the Council of State of 1806 refurbished and new-bordered with fresh  lace; the old Corps Legislatif patched up, with new nails and fresh  paint, minus Laine and plus Morny! In lieu of liberty of the press, the  bureau of public spirit; in place of individual liberty, the ministry  of police. All these \"institutions,\" which we have passed in review,  are nothing more than the old salon furniture of the Empire. Beat it,  dust it, sweep away the cobwebs, splash it over with stains of French  blood, and you have the establishment of 1852. This bric-a-brac governs  France. These are the creations!    Where is common sense? where is reason? where is truth? Not a sound  side of contemporary intelligence that has not received a shock, not a  just conquest of the age that has not been thrown down and broken. All  sorts of extravagance become possible. All that we have seen since the  2nd of December is a gallop, through all that is absurd, of a  commonplace man broken loose.    These individuals, the malefactor and his accomplices, are in  possession of immense, incomparable, absolute, unlimited power,  sufficient, we repeat, to change the whole face of Europe. They make  use of it only for amusement. To enjoy and to enrich themselves, such  is their \"socialism.\" They have stopped the budget on the public  highway; the coffers are open; they fill their money-bags: they have  money,--do you want some, here you are! All the salaries are doubled or  trebled; we have given the figures above. Three ministers, Turgot (for  there is a Turgot in this affair), Persigny and Maupas, have a million  each of secret funds; the Senate a million, the Council of State half a  million, the officers of the 2nd of December have a Napoleon-month,  that is to say, millions; the soldiers of the 2nd of December have  medals, that is to say, millions; M. Murat wants millions and will have  them; a minister gets married,--quick, half a million; M. Bonaparte,  _quia nominor Poleo_, has twelve millions, plus four millions,--sixteen  millions. Millions, millions! This regime is called Million. M.  Bonaparte has three hundred horses for private use, the fruit and  vegetables of the national domains, and parks and gardens formerly  royal; he is stuffed to repletion; he said the other day: \"all my  carriages,\" as Charles V said: \"all my Spains,\" and as Peter the Great  said: \"all my Russias.\" The marriage of Gamache is celebrated at the  Elysee; the spits are turning day and night before the fireworks;  according to the bulletins published on the subject, the bulletins of  the new Empire, they consume there six hundred and fifty pounds of meat  every day; the Elysee will soon have one hundred and forty-nine  kitchens, like the Castle of Schoenbrunn; they drink, they eat, they  laugh, they feast; banquet at all the ministers', banquet at the Ecole  Militaire, banquet at the Hotel de Ville, banquet at the Tuileries, a  monster fete on the 10th of May, a still more monster fete on the 15th  of August; they swim in all sorts of abundance and intoxication. And  the man of the people, the poor day-labourer who is out of work, the  pauper in rags, with bare feet, to whom summer brings no bread, and  winter no wood, whose old mother lies in agony upon a rotten mattress,  whose daughter walks the streets for a livelihood, whose little  children are shivering with hunger, fever and cold, in the hovels of  Faubourg Saint-Marceau, in the cock-lofts of Rouen, and in the cellars  of Lille, does any one think of him? What is to become of him? What is  done for him? Let him die like a dog!          X    THE TWO PROFILES OF M.

Patterson, Assistant Secretary  John J. McCloy, and Truman K. Gibson, Jr., who was Judge Hastie's  successor, but most of all impressed by the performance of black  soldiers themselves, Stimson belatedly modified his defense of  segregation. But throughout the war he adhered to the traditional  arguments of the Army's professional staff.                       [Footnote 2-7: Stimson, a Republican, had been                     appointed by Roosevelt in 1940, along with                     Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, in an effort to                     enlist bipartisan support for the administration's                     foreign policy in an election year. Stimson brought                     a wealth of experience with him to the office,                     having served as Secretary of War under William                     Howard Taft and Secretary of State under Herbert                     Hoover.

He lived up to the letter of the Army's regulations,  consistently supporting measures to eliminate overt discrimination in  the wartime Army. At the same time, he rejected the idea that the Army  should take the lead in altering the racial mores of the nation. Asked  for his views on Hastie's \"carefully prepared memo,\"[2-9] General  Marshall admitted that many of the recommendations were sound but said  that Judge Hastie's proposals         would be tantamount to solving a social problem which has       perplexed the American people throughout the history of this       nation. The Army cannot accomplish such a solution and        (p. 022)       should not be charged with the undertaking. The settlement of       vexing racial problems cannot be permitted to complicate the       tremendous task of the War Department and thereby jeopardize       discipline and morale.[2-10]                       [Footnote 2-9: Memo, USW for CofS, 6 Oct 41,                     G-1/15640-120.]                       [Footnote 2-10: Memo, CofS for SW, 1 Dec 41, sub:                     Report of Judge William H. Hastie, Civilian Aide to                     the Secretary of War, dated 22 Sep 41, OCS                     20602-219.]    As Chief of Staff, Marshall faced the tremendous task of creating in  haste a large Army to deal with the Axis menace. Since for several  practical reasons the bulk of that Army would be trained in the south  where its conscripts would be subject to southern laws, Marshall saw  no alternative but to postpone reform. The War Department, he said,  could not ignore the social relationship between blacks and whites,  established by custom and habit. Nor could it ignore the fact that the  \"level of intelligence and occupational skill\" of the black population  was considerably below that of whites. Though he agreed that the Army  would reach maximum strength only if individuals were placed according  to their abilities, he concluded that experiments to solve social  problems would be \"fraught with danger to efficiency, discipline, and  morale.\" In sum, Marshall saw no reason to change the policy approved  by the President less than a year before.[2-11]                       [Footnote 2-11: Ibid. See also Forrest C. Pogue,                     _George C. Marshall: Organizer of Victory_ (New                     York: The Viking Press, 1973), pp. 96-99.]    The Army's leaders and the secretary's civilian aide had reached an  impasse on the question of policy even before the country entered the  war. And though the use of black troops in World War I was not  entirely satisfactory even to its defenders,[2-12] there appeared to be  no time now, in view of the larger urgency of winning the war, to plan  other approaches, try other solutions, or tamper with an institution  that had won victory in the past. Further ordering the thoughts of  some senior Army officials was their conviction that wide-scale mixing  of the races in the services might, as Under Secretary Patterson  phrased it, foment social revolution.[2-13]                       [Footnote 2-12: The Army staff's mobilization                     planning for black units in the 1930's generally                     relied upon the detailed testimony of the                     commanders of black units in World War I. This                     testimony, contained in documents submitted to the                     War Department and the Army War College, was often                     critical of the Army's employment of black troops,                     although rarely critical of segregation. The                     material is now located in the U.S. Army's Military                     History Research Collection, Carlisle Barracks,                     Pennsylvania. For discussion of the post-World War                     I review of the employment of black troops, see                     Lee's _Employment of Negro Troops_, Chapter I, and                     Alan M. Osur's _Blacks in the Army Air Forces                     During World War II: The Problem of Race Relations_                     (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1977),                     Chapter I.]                       [Footnote 2-13: Memo, USW for Maj Gen William Bryden                     (principal deputy chief of staff), 10 Jan 42, OCS                     20602-250.]    These opinions were clearly evident on 8 December 1941, the day the  United States entered World War II, when the Army's leaders met with a  group of black publishers and editors. Although General Marshall  admitted that he was not satisfied with the department's progress in  racial matters and promised further changes, the conference concluded  with a speech by a representative of The Adjutant General who  delivered what many considered the final word on integration during  the war.         The Army is made up of individual citizens of the United States       who have pronounced views with respect to the Negro just as they       have individual ideas with respect to other matters in their       daily walk of life. Military orders, fiat, or dicta, will not       change their viewpoints. The Army then cannot be made the     (p. 023)       means of engendering conflict among the mass of people       because of a stand with respect to Negroes which is not       compatible with the position attained by the Negro in civil       life.... The Army is not a sociological laboratory; to be       effective it must be organized and trained according to the       principles which will insure success. Experiments to meet the       wishes and demands of the champions of every race and creed for       the solution of their problems are a danger to efficiency,       discipline and morale and would result in ultimate defeat.[2-14]                       [Footnote 2-14: Col Eugene R. Householder, TAGO,                     Speech Before Conference of Negro Editors and                     Publishers, 8 Dec 41, AG 291.21 (12-1-41) (1).]    The civil rights advocates refused to concede that the discussion was  over. Judge Hastie, along with a sizable segment of the black press,  believed that the beginning of a world war was the time to improve  military effectiveness by increasing black participation in that  war.[2-15] They argued that eliminating segregation was part of the  struggle to preserve democracy, the transcendent issue of the war, and  they viewed the unvarying pattern of separate black units as consonant  with the racial theories of Nazi Germany.[2-16] Their continuing efforts  to eliminate segregation and discrimination eventually brought Hastie  a sharp reminder from John J. McCloy. \"Frankly, I do not think that  the basic issues of this war are involved in the question of whether  colored troops serve in segregated units or in mixed units and I doubt  whether you can convince people of the United States that the basic  issues of freedom are involved in such a question.\" For Negroes, he  warned sternly, the basic issue was that if the United States lost the  war, the lot of the black community would be far worse off, and some  Negroes \"do not seem to be vitally concerned about winning the war.\"  What all Negroes ought to do, he counseled, was to give unstinting  support to the war effort in anticipation of benefits certain to come  after victory.[2-17]                       [Footnote 2-15: Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_,                     ch. VI.]                       [Footnote 2-16: Noteworthy is the fact that for                     several reasons not related to race (for instance,                     language and nationality) the German Army also                     organized separate units. Its 162d Infantry                     Division was composed of troops from Turkestan and                     the Caucasus, and its 5th SS Panzer Division had                     segregated Scandinavian, Dutch, and Flemish                     regiments. Unlike the racially segregated U.S.                     Army, Germany's so-called Ost units were only                     administratively organized into separate divisions,                     and an Ost infantry battalion was often integrated                     into a \"regular\" German infantry"]]]
