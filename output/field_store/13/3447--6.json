Fearful are the deeds  of Saxon sorcery as related by the old Norman or Anglo-Norman  writers. Roger of Wendover ('Flowers of History') records the  terrible fate of a hag who lived in the village of Berkely, in  the ninth century. The devil at the appointed hour (as in the  case of Faust) punctually carries off the soul of his slave, in  spite of the utmost watch and ward. These scenes are, perhaps,  rather Norman than Saxon. It was a favourite belief of the  ancients and mediaevalists that the inhospitable regions of the  remoter North were the abode of demons who held in those suitable  localities their infernal revels, exciting storms and tempests:  and the monk-chronicler Bede relates the northern parts of  Britain were thus infested.[51]      [49] The Saxon 'witch' is derived, apparently, from the verb    'to weet,' to know, _be wise_. The Latin 'saga' is similarly    derived--'Sagire, sentire acute est: ex quo _sagae_ anus,    quia malta _scire_ volunt.'--Cicero, _de Divinatione_.      [50] A curious collection of old English superstitions in    these and their allied forms, as exhibited in various    documents, appears in a recent work of authority, entitled    'Leechdoms, Wort-Cunning, and Starcraft of Early England.    Published by the authority of the Lords Commissioners of Her    Majesty's Treasury, under the direction of the Master of the    Rolls.' Diseases of all sorts are for the most part inflicted    upon mankind by evil demons, through the agency of spells and    incantations.      [51] Strutt derives the 'long-continued custom of swimming    people suspected of witchcraft' from the Anglo-Saxon mode of    judicial trial--the ordeal by water. Another 'method of    proving a witch,' by weighing against the Church Bible (a    formidable balance), is traced to some of their ancient    customs. James VI. (_Demonologie_) is convinced that 'God    hath appointed, for a supernatural sign of the monstrous    impiety of witches, that the water shall refuse to receive    them in her bosom that have shaken off them the sacred water    of baptism and wilfully refused the benefit thereof.'    From Scandinavia the Normans must have brought a conviction of  the truths of magic; and although they had been long settled,  before the conquest of England, in Northern France and in  Christianity, the traditional glories of the land from which were  derived their name and renown could not be easily forgotten. Not  long after the Conquest the Arabic learning of Spain made its way  into this country, and it is possible that Christian magic, as  well as science, may have been influenced by it. Magic,  scientifically treated, flourished in Arabic Spain, being  extensively cultivated, in connection with more real or practical  learning, by the polite and scientific Arabs. The schools of  Salamanca, Toledo, and other Saracenic cities were famous  throughout Europe for eminence in medicine, chymistry, astronomy,  and mathematics. Thither resorted the learned of the North to  perfect themselves in the then cultivated branches of knowledge.  The vast amount of scientific literature of the Moslems of Spain,  evidenced in their public libraries, relieves Southern Europe,  in part at least, from the stigma of a universal barbaric  illiteracy.[52] Several volumes of Arabian philosophy are said to  have been introduced to Northern Europe in the twelfth century;  and it was in the school of Toledo that Gerbert--a conspicuous  name in the annals of magic--acquired his preternatural  knowledge.      [52] The royal library of the Fatimites consisted of 100,000    manuscripts, elegantly transcribed and splendidly bound,    which were lent, without avarice or jealousy, to the    students of Cairo. Yet this collection must appear moderate    if we believe that the Ommiades of Spain had formed a    library of 600,000 volumes, 44 of which were employed in the    mere catalogue. Their capital, Cordova, with the adjacent    towns of Malaga, Almeira, and Murcia, had given birth to    more than 300 writers; and above 70 public libraries were    opened in the cities of the Andalusian kingdom.--_Decline    and Fall of the Roman Empire_, lii.    The few in any way acquainted with Greek literature were indebted  to the Latin translations of the Arabs; while the Jewish  rabbinical learning, whose more useful lore was encumbered with  much mystical nonsense, enjoyed considerable reputation at this  period. The most distinguished of the rabbis taught in the  schools in London, York, Lincoln, Oxford, and Cambridge; and  Christendom has to confess its obligations for its first  acquaintance with science to the enemies of the Cross.[53] The  later Jewish authorities had largely developed the demonology of  the subjects of Persia; and the spiritual or demoniacal creations  of the rabbinical works of the Middle Ages might be readily  acceptable, if not coincident, to Christian faith. But the  Western Europeans, before the philosophy of the Spanish Arabs was  known, had come in contact with the Saracens and Turks of the  East during frequent pilgrimages to the tomb of Christ; and the  fanatical crusades of the eleventh and twelfth centuries  facilitated and secured the hazardous journey. Mohammedans of the  present day preserve the implicit faith of their ancestors in the  efficacy of the 113th chapter of the Koran against evil spirits,  the spells of witches and sorcerers--a chapter said to have been  revealed to the Prophet of Islam on the occasion of his having  been bewitched by the daughters of a Jew. The Genii or Ginn--a  Preadamite race occupying an intermediate position between angels  and men, who assume at pleasure the form of men, of the lower  animals, or any monstrous shape, and propagate their species  like, and sometimes with, human kind--appear in imposing  proportions in 'The Thousand and One Nights'--that rich display  of the fancy of the Oriental imagination.[54] Credulous and  confused in critical perception, the crusading adventurers for  religion or rapine could scarcely fail to confound with their own  the peculiar tenets of an ill-understood mode of thought; and  that the critical and discriminating faculties of the champions  of the Cross were not of the highest order, is illustrated by  their difficulty in distinguishing the eminently unitarian  religion of Mohammed from paganism. By a strange perversion the  Anglo-Norman and French chroniclers term the Moslems _Pagans_,  while the Saxon heathen are dignified by the title of _Saracens_;  and the names of Mahmoud, Termagaunt, Apollo, could be confounded  without any sense of impropriety. However, or in whatever degree,  Saracenic or rabbinical superstition tended to influence  Christian demonology, from about the end of the thirteenth  century a considerable development in the mythology of witchcraft  is perceptible.[55]      [53] Chymistry and Algebra still attest our obligation by    their Arabic etymology.      [54] A common tradition is that Soliman, king of the Jews,    having finally subdued--a success which he owed chiefly to    his vast magical resources--the rebellious spirits, punished    their disobedience by incarcerating them in various kinds of    prisons, for longer or shorter periods of time, in proportion    to their demerits. For the belief of the followers of    Mohammed in the magic excellence of Solomon, see Sale's    _Koran_, xxi. and xxvii. According to the prophet, the devil    taught men magic and sorcery. The magic of the Moslems, or,    at least, of the Egyptians, is of two kinds--high and    low--which are termed respectively _rahmanee_ (divine) and    _sheytanee_ (Satanic). By a perfect knowledge of the former    it is possible to the adept to 'raise the dead to life, kill    the living, transport himself instantly wherever he pleases,    and perform any other miracle. The _low_ magic (_sooflee_ or    _sheytanee_) is believed to depend on the agency of the devil    and evil spirits, and unbelieving genii, and to be used for    bad purposes and by bad men.' The _divine_ is 'founded on the    agency of God and of His angels, &c., and employed always for    good purposes, and only to be practised by men of probity,    who, by tradition or from books, learn the names of those    superhuman agents, &c.'--Lane's _Modern Egyptians_, chap.    xii.      [55] Its effect was probably to enlarge more than to modify    appreciably the current ideas. A large proportion of the    importations from the East may have been indebted to the    invention, as much as to the credulity, of the adventurers;    and we might be disposed to believe with Hume, that 'men    returning from so great a distance used the liberty [a too    general one] of imposing every fiction upon their believing    audience.'    Conspicuous in the vulgar prejudices is the suspicion attaching  to the extraordinary discoveries of philosophy and science.  Diabolic inspiration (as in our age infidelity and atheism are  popular outcries) was a ready and successful accusation against  ideas or discoveries in advance of the time. Roger Bacon, Robert  Grostete, Albert the Great, Thomas of Ercildoun, Michael  Scot--eminent names--were all more or less objects of a  persecuting suspicion. Bacon may justly be considered the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22829"],[0,"No Animal Food; and Nutrition and Diet; with Vegetable Recipes (#11)"],[1," to be  kept pure and holy.    We have now to consider (_a_) what to eat, (_b_) when to eat, (_c_) how  to eat. First, then, we will consider the nutritive properties of the  common food-stuffs.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 3: This is not an exaggeration. 'Genoa Cake,' for instance,  contains ten varieties of food: butter, sugar, eggs, flour, milk,  sultanas, orange and lemon peel, almonds, and baking powder.]          II    WHAT TO EAT      Among the foods rich in protein are the legumes, the cereals, and nuts.  Those low in protein are fresh fruits, green vegetables, and roots. Fat  is chiefly found in nuts, olives, and certain pulses, particularly the  peanut; and carbohydrates in cereals, pulses, and many roots. Fruit and  green vegetables consist mostly of water and organic mineral compounds,  and in the case of the most juicy varieties may be regarded more as  drink than food. We have, then, six distinct classes of food--the  pulses, cereals, nuts, fruits, green vegetables, and roots. Let us  briefly consider the nutritive value of each.    Pulse foods usually form an important item in a vegetarian dietary. They  are very rich in their nutritive properties, and even before matured are  equal or superior in value to any other green vegetable. 'The ripened  seed shows by analysis a very remarkable contrast to most of the matured  foods, as the potato and other tubers, and even to the best cereals, as  wheat. This superiority lies in the large amount of nitrogen in the  form of protein that they contain.' Peas, beans, and lentils should be  eaten very moderately, being highly concentrated foods. The removal of  the skins from peas and beans, also of the germs of beans, by  parboiling, is recommended, as they are then more easily digested and  less liable to 'disagree.' These foods, it is interesting to know are  used extensively by the vegetarian nations. The Mongol procures his  supply of protein chiefly from the Soya bean from which he makes  different preparations of bean cheese and sauce. It is said that the  poorer classes of Spaniards and the Bedouins rely on a porridge of  lentils for their mainstay. In India and China where rice is the staple  food, beans are eaten to provide the necessary nitrogenous matter, as  rice alone is considered deficient in protein.    With regard to the pulse foods, Dr. Haig, in his works on uric acid,  states that, containing as they do considerable xanthin, an exceedingly  harmful poison, they are not to be commended as healthful articles of  diet. He states that he has found the pulses to contain even more  xanthin than many kinds of flesh-meat, and as it is this poison in flesh  that causes him to so strongly condemn the eating of meat, he naturally  condemns the eating of any foods in which this poison exists in any  considerable quantity. He writes: 'So far as I know the \"vegetarians\" of  this country are decidedly superior in endurance to those feeding on  animal tissues, who might otherwise be expected to equal them; but  these \"vegetarians\" would be still better if they not only ruled out  animal flesh, but also eggs, the pulses (peas, beans, lentils and  peanuts), eschew nuts, asparagus, and mushrooms, as well as tea, coffee  and cocoa, all of which contain a large amount of uric acid, or  substances physiologically equivalent to it.'    Dr. Haig attributes many diseases and complaints to the presence of uric  acid in the blood and its deposits in the tissues: 'Uric acid diseases  fall chiefly in two groups: (a) The arthritic group, comprising gout,  rheumatism, and similar affections of many fibrous tissues throughout  the body; (b) the circulation group including headache, epilepsy, mental  depression, anaemia, Bright's disease, etc.' Speaking with regard to  rheumatism met with among the vegetarian natives of India, Dr. Haig  writes: 'I believe it will appear, on investigation, that in those parts  of India where rice and fresh vegetables form the staple foods, not only  rheumatism, but uric acid diseases generally are little known, whereas  in those parts where pulses are largely consumed, they are  common--almost universal.'    The cereals constitute the mainstay of vegetarians all the world over,  and although not superior to nuts, must be considered an exceedingly  valuable, and, in some cases, essential food material. They differ  considerably in their nutritive properties, so it is necessary to  examine the worth of each separately.    Wheat, though not universally the most extensively used of the cereals,  is the most popular and best known cereal in this country. It has been  cultivated for ages and has been used by nearly all peoples. It is  customary to grind the berries into a fine meal which is mixed with  water and baked. There are various opinions about the comparative value  of white and whole-wheat flour. There is no doubt but that the  whole-wheat flour containing, as it does, more woody fibre than the  white, has a tendency to increase the peristaltic action of the  intestines, and thus is valuable for persons troubled with  constipation.[4] From a large number of analyses it has been determined  that entire wheat flour contains about 2.4 per cent. more protein than  white flour (all grades), yet experiments have demonstrated that the  _available_ protein is less in entire wheat-flour than in white  flour.[5] This is probably due to the fact that the protein which is  enclosed in the bran cannot be easily assimilated, as the digestive  organs are unable to break up the outer walls of woody fibre and extract  the nitrogenous matter they contain. On the other hand whole-wheat flour  contains considerably more valuable and available mineral matter than  does white flour. The two outer layers contain compounds of phosphorus,  lime, iron, and soda. Analyses by Atwater show entire-wheat flour to  contain twice as much mineral matter as white flour. It is affirmed by  Broadbent and others, that this mineral matter is exceedingly valuable  both as a nutrient, and because of its neutralising effect upon proteid  wastes, and that it is because of this that flour made from the  entire-wheat berry has very superior food value to that made from the  berry minus the outer cuticles. Many dietetists look upon whole-wheat  bread as one of the most salutary of all foods and strongly advise its  use in place of white bread. A well-known doctor states that he has  known it a cure for many diseases, and thinks that many nervous  complaints due to 'saline starvation' can be cured by substituting  whole-meal for white bread.    But in opposition to these views Dr. Haig thinks that as the outer brown  husk of all cereals contains some xanthin, it should on this account be  removed. He therefore recommends white flour, (not superfine, but  cheap-grade), in place of the entire-wheat. Others, however, are of the  opinion that the amount of xanthin present in the bran is so small as  not to be considered, especially when, by the removal of the xanthin,  valuable mineral matter is also removed.    Of course, it is difficult for a layman to form an opinion when experts  differ. Perhaps the best thing to do is to use whole-wheat bread if  there is any tendency to constipation. If not, then choose that which is  the more palatable, or change from one to the other as inclination  dictates. This adds to variety, and as digestion is better when the food  is better relished, no doubt, in this case, that which pleases the taste  best is the best to eat. At least, we can hold this view tentatively for  the present.    Wheat flour (entire), ranks the highest of all the cereals in protein,  excepting oatmeal, averaging 13 per cent. In fat it exceeds rice and  rye, is equal with barley and maize, but considerably below oatmeal:  averaging about 1.9 per cent. In carbohydrates it averages about  seventy-two per cent., all the cereals being very much alike in quantity  of these nutrients. It is a well-balanced food, as indeed, all cereals  are, and is palatable prepared in a variety of ways, although, made into  unleavened, unsalted bread, the sweet, nutty flavour of the berry itself  is best preserved.    Oatmeal is not extensively used, comparatively speaking, although it has  an excellent reputation. It is decidedly the richest cereal in protein  and fat, especially fat, and this is probably why people living in cold  climates find it such a sustaining food. In protein it averages 16.1 per  cent.: in fat 7.2 per cent. It is very commonly used as porridge. When  well cooked, that is to say, for several hours, this is a good way to  prepare it, but a better is to eat it dry in the form of unsweetened  oatcakes, scones, etc., these being more easily digested because  necessitating thorough mastication. The above remarks regarding the  removal of the bran from wheat-flour are precisely as applicable to  oatmeal, as well as rye, so no more need be said on that point.    Rye flour is not unlike wheat, and is used more extensively than wheat  in many parts of Europe. It has 2 per cent. less protein than wheat and  its gluten is darker in colour and less elastic and so does not make as  light a loaf; but this does not detract from its nutritive value at all.  Being more easily cultivated than wheat, especially in cold countries,  it is cheaper and therefore more of a poor man's food.    Indian corn, or maize, or Turkish wheat, is one of the finest of  cereals. It is used extensively in America, North and South, in parts of  the Orient, in Italy, the Balkans, Servia, and elsewhere. It is used as  a green vegetable and when fully matured is ground into meal and made  into bread, porridge, biscuits, Johnny-cake, etc., etc. Corn compared to  wheat is rich in fat, but in protein wheat is the richer by about 3 per  cent. Sugar corn, cooked and canned, is sold in England by food-reform  dealers. It is perhaps the most tasty of all the cereals.    Rice is the staple of the Orientals. The practice"]]]
