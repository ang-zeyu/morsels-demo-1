But whatever instances there may have  been of such devotion, more often the sick and the dying were tended  by the pitying care of those who had recovered, because they knew the  course of the disease and were themselves free from apprehension. For  no one was ever attacked a second time, or not with a fatal result.  All men congratulated them; and they themselves, in the excess of  their joy at the moment, had an innocent fancy that they could not die  of any other sickness.    The crowding of the people out of the country into the city aggravated  the misery, and the newly arrived suffered most. For, having no houses  of their own, but inhabiting, in the height of summer, stifling huts,  the mortality among them was dreadful, and they perished in wild  disorder. The dead lay as they had died, one upon another, while  others hardly alive wallowed in the streets and crawled about every  fountain craving for water. The temples in which they lodged were full  of the corpses of those who had died in them; for the violence of the  calamity was such that men, not knowing where to turn, grew reckless  of all law, human and divine. The customs which had hitherto been  observed at funerals were universally violated, and they buried their  dead each one as best he could. Many, having no proper appliances,  because the deaths in their household had been so frequent, made no  scruple of using the burial-place of others. When one man had raised a  funeral pile, others would come, and throwing on their dead first, set  fire to it; or when some other corpse was already burning, before they  could be stopt would throw their own dead upon it and depart.    There were other and worse forms of lawlessness which the plague  introduced at Athens. Men who had hitherto concealed their indulgence  in pleasure now grew bolder. For, seeing the sudden change--how the  rich died in a moment, and those who had nothing immediately inherited  their property--they reflected that life and riches were alike  transitory, and they resolved to enjoy themselves while they could,  and to think only of pleasure. Who would be willing to sacrifice  himself to the law of honor when he knew not whether he would ever  live to be held in honor? The pleasure of the moment and any sort of  thing which conduced to it took the place both of honor and of  expediency. No fear of God or law of man deterred a criminal. Those  who saw all perishing alike thought that the worship or neglect of the  gods made no difference. For offenses against human law no punishment  was to be feared; no one would live long enough to be called to  account. Already a far heavier sentence had been passed and was  hanging over a man's head; before that feeling, why should he not take  a little pleasure?    Such was the grievous calamity which now afflicted the Athenians;  within the walls their people were dying, and without, their country  was being ravaged. In their troubles they naturally called to mind a  verse which the elder men among them declared to have been current  long ago:         \"A Dorian war will come and a plague with it.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 25: The Peloponnesian war broke out in 431 B.C., and lasted  until 404. Its result was the abasement of Athens and the elevation of  Sparta to supreme power in Greece. When it began, Athens with her  allies included all the coast cities of Asia Minor as far south as  Lycia, the cities bordering on the Thracian and Chalcidian shores, and  nearly all the islands of the AEgean Sea. Sparta at the same time was  leader in a confederacy of independent states, among which were nearly  all the Peloponnesian states, besides some of those in northern  Greece, those of Magna Graecia and Sicily. Athens was strong in her  navy, which comprized 300 galleys, while the Spartan strength lay in  her land forces. The treasury of Athens was full, that of Sparta weak.  After the war, the walls of Athens were demolished and she was  deprived of her foreign possessions. The government set over her was  an oligarchy of thirty persons, known in history as the thirty  tyrants. These men soon made their harsh rule so intolerable that  within sixteen months after Athens surrendered to Sparta they were  deposed and democratic rule was restored to the Athenians.]    [Footnote 26: From Book II of the \"History of the Peloponnesian War.\"  Translated by Benjamin Jowett.]    [Footnote 27: One of the larger islands of the AEgean Sea, its area  being about one hundred and eighty square miles.]          III    THE SAILING OF THE ATHENIAN FLEET FOR SICILY[28] (413 B.C.)      About the middle of summer the expedition started for Sicily. Orders  had been previously given to most of the allies, to the corn-ships,  the smaller craft, and generally to the vessels in attendance on the  armament that they should muster at Corcyra, whence the whole fleet  was to strike across the Ionian Gulf to the promontory of Iapygia.[29]  Early in the morning of the day appointed for their departure, the  Athenians and such of their allies as had already joined them went  down to the Piraeus and began to man the ships. The entire population  of Athens accompanied them, citizens and strangers alike. The citizens  came to take farewell, one of an acquaintance another of a kinsman,  another of a son; the crowd as they passed along were full of hope and  full of tears; hope of conquering Sicily, tears because they doubted  whether they would ever see their friends again, when they thought of  the long voyage on which they were sending them. At the moment of  parting, the danger was nearer; and terrors which had never occurred  to them when they were voting the expedition now entered into their  souls. Nevertheless their spirits revived at the sight of the armament  in all its strength and of the abundant provision which they had made.  The strangers and the rest of the multitude came out of curiosity,  desiring to witness an enterprise of which the greatness exceeded  belief.    No armament so magnificent or costly had ever been sent out by any  single Hellenic power, tho in mere number of ships and hoplites that  which sailed to Epidaurus under Pericles and afterward under Hagnon to  Potidaea was not inferior. For that expedition consisted of a hundred  Athenian and fifty Chian and Lesbian triremes, conveying four thousand  hoplites, all Athenian citizens, three hundred cavalry, and a  multitude of allied troops. Still the voyage was short and the  equipments were poor, whereas this expedition was intended to be long  absent, and was thoroughly provided both for sea and land service,  wherever its presence might be required.    On the fleet the greatest pains and expense had been lavished by the  trierarchs and the state. The public treasury gave a drachma a day to  each sailor, and furnished empty hulls for sixty swift sailing  vessels, and for forty transports carrying hoplites. All these were  manned with the best crews which could be obtained. The trierarchs,  besides the pay given by the state, added somewhat more out of their  own means to the wages of the upper ranks of rowers and of the petty  officers. The figureheads and other fittings provided by the  trierarchs were of the most costly description. Every one strove to  the utmost that his own ship might excel both in beauty and  swiftness. The infantry had been well selected and the lists carefully  made up. There was the keenest rivalry among the soldiers in the  matter of arms and personal equipment.    And while at home the Athenians were thus competing with one another  in the performance of their several duties, to the rest of Hellas the  expedition seemed to be a grand display of their power and greatness,  rather than a preparation for war. If any one had reckoned up the  whole expenditure (1) of the state, (2) of individual soldiers and  others, including in the first not only what the city had already laid  out, but what was entrusted to the generals, and in the second what  either at the time or afterward private persons spent upon their  outfit, or the trierarchs upon their ships, the provision for the long  voyage which every one may be supposed to have carried with him over  and above his public pay, and what soldiers or traders may have taken  for purposes of exchange, he would have found that altogether an  immense sum amounting to many talents was withdrawn from the city. Men  were quite amazed at the boldness of the scheme and the magnificence  of the spectacle, which were everywhere spoken of, no less than at the  great disproportion of the force when compared with that of the enemy  against whom it was intended. Never had a greater expedition been sent  to a foreign land; never was there an enterprise in which the hope of  future success seemed to be better justified by actual power.    When the ships were manned and everything required for the voyage had  been placed on board, silence was proclaimed by the sound of the  trumpet, and all with one voice before setting sail offered up the  customary prayers; these were recited, not in each ship, but by a  single herald, the whole fleet accompanying him. On every deck both  officers and men, mingling wine in bowls, made libations from vessels  of gold and silver. The multitude of citizens and other well-wishers  who were looking on from the land joined in the prayer. The crews  raised the paean, and when the libations were completed, put to sea.  After sailing out for some distance in single file, the ships raced  with one another as far as AEgina;[30] thence they hastened onward to  Corcyra, where the allies who formed the rest of the army were  assembling.    Meanwhile reports of the expedition were coming in to Syracuse from  many quarters, but for a long time nobody gave credit to them. At  length an assembly was held. Even then different opinions were  exprest, some affirming and others"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20910"],[0,"South American Fights and Fighters, and Other Tales of Adventure (#11)"],[1,"at some convenient point while Almagro, the traverser,  went back for reenforcements.  Pizarro elected to pitch his camp on the  little Island of Gallo which they had discovered.  Those who were  appointed to remain with him rebelled at the decision which left them  marooned on a desolate island with no adequate provisions for their  needs.  Pizarro, however, insisted and Almagro sailed with the other  ship.  Shortly afterward, Pizarro sent the remaining ship with the most  obstinate of the mutineers to Panama.  A letter revealing their sad  plight, which was concealed in a ball of cotton sent as a present to  the wife of the governor by one of the men on the island of Gallo, was  smuggled ashore at Panama when Almagro's ship reached that point,  despite his vigilant efforts to allow no such communications to pass.    There was a new governor in Panama, Pedro de los Rios.  Incensed by the  loss of life and the hardships of the two expeditions, with the lack of  definite and tangible results, and disregarding the remonstrances of  Almagro, he dispatched two ships under one Pedro Tafur to bring them  back.  Life on the island of Gallo had been a hideous experience.  Famine, disease and inclement weather had taken off many and had broken  the spirit of the most of the rest of the band.  Nothing could break  that of Pizarro.  When Tafur appeared, he refused to return.  Drawing  {63} an east-and-west line upon the sand with his sword, he made a  brief soldierly address to his men.    \"Friends and comrades,\" he said, facing the south, \"on that side of the  line are toil, hunger, nakedness, the drenching storm, destruction and  death.  On this side,\" turning to the north, \"are ease and pleasure.  There lies Peru with its riches.  Here, Panama with its poverty.  Choose each man as best becomes a cavalier of Castile.  For my part, I  go to the south.\"    Such was the effect of his electrifying words, that, as he stepped over  the line, a number of his comrades, led by Ruiz, the pilot, and Pedro  de Candia, a Greek gunner, followed him.  The number varies from  thirteen to sixteen according to different authorities.  The weight of  evidence inclines me to the smaller number.[3]    Tafur raged and threatened, but Pizarro and his men persisted.  They  got themselves transferred to the Island of Gorgona where there were  water and game and no inhabitants, and there they stayed while Tafur  returned.    {64}    Less than a score of men marooned on a desert island in an unknown sea,  opposite a desolate and forbidding coast, without a ship or any means  of leaving the island, not knowing whether Almagro and Luque would be  able to succor them; their position was indeed a desperate one.  It  shows, as nothing else could, the iron determination of the indomitable  Spaniard.  At that moment when Pizarro drew the line and stepped across  it after that fiery address, he touched at the same time the nadir of  his fortunes and the zenith of his fame.  Surely it stands as one of  the great dramatic incidents of history.  The conquest of Peru turned  upon that very instant, upon the determination of that moment; and upon  the conquest of Peru depended more things in the future history of the  earth than were dreamed of in the narrow philosophy of any Spaniard  there present, or of any other man in existence in that long-past day.    Peru has played a tremendously important part in the affairs of men.  It was the treasure of Peru that armed the soldiers of Alva and laid  the keels of the Armada.  It was the treasure of Peru that relieved the  Spanish people of the necessity of wresting a national revenue out of a  soil by agriculture; which abrogated the auxiliary of agriculture,  manufactures; which precluded the possibility of the corollary of the  other two, commerce.  It was the treasure of Peru that permitted the  Spanish people to indulge that passion for religious bigotry which was  stifling to liberty and throttling to development, and which put them  hopelessly out of touch with the onward and progressive movement of  humanity in one of the most vital periods and movements in history.  It  was the treasure of Peru that kindled the fires of the Inquisition,  {65} in which the best blood of the nation lighted it to its downfall,  and blazed the way for Manila and Santiago.  Philip II, and his  decadent and infamous successors depended upon the mines of Potosi and  the mines of Potosi hung upon Pizarro and his line in the sand.  The  base-born, ignorant, cruel soldier wrecked in one moment a nation, made  and unmade empires, and changed the whole course of the world.    It was largely the Spanish zeal and intolerance that developed and made  perfect the Reformation, for no great cause has ever won success  without opposition, nay, persecution.  \"The blood of the martyr,\" says  St. Augustine, \"is the seed of the church.\"    To return to the situation.  Tafur presently reached Panama and  reported.  The governor and the people of that city looked upon Pizarro  as a madman.  Luque and Almagro were unwearying in their efforts and  importunities, however, and finally they wrung a reluctant permission  from De los Rios for Ruiz and one small ship and a few men to go to the  rescue, with the proviso that a return must be made within six months.  One can imagine the joy with which the desperate adventurers on the  island saw the sails of that ship whitening the horizon.  Once more  they set sail to the south, arriving finally before a large and  populous town called Tumbez.  Here they saw undoubted signs of the  existence of a great empire in a high state of civilization.  The  little party had some pleasant intercourse with the natives of Tumbez.    They gathered a considerable amount of gold and silver, some of it  exquisitely wrought by cunning artificers into the forms of beautiful  and unknown plants and animals.  There was no possible doubt as to {66}  the truth of their golden dreams.  The empire of Peru in all its  magnificence lay before them.    Too meagre a force to embrace the opportunity, there was nothing to do  but to return to Panama.  There it was agreed that Pizarro, with De  Candia, should go over to Spain, taking with him Peruvians and  treasures, tell what he had seen, and secure the royal countenance and  support for their future undertaking, while Almagro and Luque remained  at Panama preparing for the final expedition.  Pizarro had no sooner  set foot in Spain than he was arrested for debt on some ancient charge  by Encisco, but he was too big a man, now, for such petty persecution  and he was at once released and ordered to present himself at court.  The rough, blunt soldier, with his terrible yet romantic tale with its  infinite possibilities, was received with astonishing cordiality.  He  gained a royal commission to discover and conquer the empire of Peru  for Spain for the distance of two hundred leagues south of the Santiago  River, and received the title of Governor and Captain-General with  large powers and revenue appertaining, which it was easy for the crown  to bestow since Pizarro had to get them himself.    Almagro, who justly felt himself slighted and his services inadequately  valued, was made Governor of Tumbez; Luque was appointed Bishop for the  same place and Protector of the Peruvians; Ruiz was named Grand Pilot  of the Southern Ocean; De Candia, a General of Artillery; and every one  of the thirteen who had crossed the line at Gallo was ennobled and made  an Hidalgo of Spain.    Then Pizarro went back to Trujillo.  Certainly it must have been a  happy moment for the neglected {67} bastard who had been a swineherd to  return to his native village under such enviable conditions.  He set  sail for America early in 1530, with three ships.  His four brothers  came with him, the able Hernando being made second in command.  Almagro  and Luque were very much chagrined at the meagre reward that had fallen  to them, and Almagro looked with deep antagonism upon the advent of the  Pizarros, who, he realized instinctively, would undermine his influence  with his partner.  This hatred the new Pizarros repaid in kind.  Some  sort of peace, however, was patched up between them, and in January,  1531, with three small ships and one hundred and eighty-three men,  including thirty-seven horses, Francisco set forth on his final voyage  of conquest.    Nearly seven years had elapsed since the first attempt was made.  As  yet they had little but empty titles, large powers, purely potential,  however, and drained purses to show for their heroic endeavor, but the  persistence of Pizarro was about to triumph at last.  After a voyage of  thirteen days, the squadron arrived at San Mateo, where the horses and  soldiers were landed and ordered to march along the shore southward,  while the ships were sent back for reenforcements which Almagro was  gathering as usual.  They returned with thirty more men and thirty-six  additional horses.  Arriving at the Gulf of Guayaquil, Pizarro  established himself on the island of Puna, opposite Tumbez, which he  cleared of its inhabitants by a series of desperate battles.  There he  was reenforced by a detachment of one hundred men with an additional  number of horses under the command of young Hernando de Soto, another  gallant Estremaduran, and quite the most attractive among this band of  desperadoes, whose {68} design was to loot an empire and proclaim the  Holy Gospel of Christ as the Spanish people had received the same.  I  have no doubt at all that the desire to propagate their religion was  quite as real and as vividly present to them at all times as was their  greed for gold.  They had a zeal for God, but not according to  knowledge; like the men of the Middle Ages who bore the cross on their  hauberks, every Spaniard was a crusader.  Aside from De Soto, there is  no single character of all those, either Indian or Spaniard, who for  fifteen years made Peru a bloody"]]]
