When it is cooked, squeeze a  lemon over and serve.      124    FRIED CODFISH    (Baccala fritto)    Place the codfish on the fire--after washing as explained in No. 107--in  a kettle with cold water and as salt, and as soon as the water boils,  remove the codfish.    After boiling cut it in little pieces and remove all the bones. Sprinkle  some flour and dip in a frying paste composed of water, flour and a  little oil. Fry in oil and serve hot.      125    CODFISH CROQUETTES    (Cotolette di baccala)    Boil as explained above and, if the quantity is one pound or a little  more put together two anchovies and some parsley, chopping everything  together very fine. Add some pepper, a tablespoonful of grated cheese,  three or four tablespoonfuls of pap, composed of bread crumbs in large  pieces, water and butter, and two eggs. Give the compound the form of  several flat cutlets, dip them in beaten egg and in ground bread crumbs.  Fry in oil and serve with lemon, or tomato sauce.      126    FRIED DOG-FISH    (Palombo fritto)    Cut the dog-fish in slices, not very thick, and place it in a plate with  beaten eggs somewhat salted. Leave for some hours until half an hour  before frying, dip the slices in a mixture of bread crumbs, grated  cheese, garlic and parsley chopped fine, salt and pepper. A clove of  garlic is sufficient for one pound of fish. Fry in oil and serve with  lemon.      127    STEWED DOG-FISH    (Palombo in umido)    Cut the dog-fish in rather big pieces and then make a hash of garlic,  parsley and very little onion. Put this hash on the fire with oil and  when it is sufficiently browned, put the pieces of dog-fish and season  with salt and pepper. When the fish is cooked pour over some tomato  sauce (No. 12), let this simmer for a while, then serve.      128    ROAST-BEEF    (Arrosto)    Although roast-beef is not an Italian dish, still it is prepared in a  peculiar way by the Italians, and hence this recipe finds its place  here.    To obtain a good roast-beef not less than two pounds ought to be cooked  on a strong fire. It ought to be covered with good olive oil and finally  with cup of soup stock which with the oil and the juice from the meat  will form a rich gravy. Salt it only when it is half cooked and do it  moderately, because the beef is already tasty by itself.    Put it on the fire half an hour before the soup is served and the meal  begins. This will be sufficient if the piece is not very big. To  ascertain the cooking prick it in the bigger part with a thin  larding-pin, but not often, in order not to allow too much juice to  escape. The juice must neither be of the color of the blood nor too  dark.    If baked it is to be seasoned with salt, oil and a piece of butter,  surrounded by raw potatoes peeled. Pour in the kettle a cup of broth or  of water. If you do not like cold roast beef, cut it into slices and  warm with butter and brown stock or tomato sauce.      129    ROAST VEAL    (Arrosto di vitella)    Choose for that milk veal that is to be found all the year round,  although it is always better during the spring or summer.    The piece or pieces of veal can be cooked in a saucepan, slightly larded  with garlic and rosemary, with oil, butter and a hash of corned beef,  salt, pepper and tomato sauce. In the gravy fresh peas can be cooked.      130    POT ROAST    (Arrosto morto)    This can be done with all kinds of meats, but the best is milk veal.  Take a good piece of the loins, roll it and tie with a string and put on  the fire with good olive oil and butter, both in small quantity. Brown  well from all sides, salt when half cooked and complete the cooking with  a half cup of broth, seeing that little juice remains. If no broth is at  hand, use tomato sauce, or tomato paste diluted with water. Some corned  beef chopped fine can also be added.      131    POT ROAST WITH GARLIC AND ROSEMARY    (Arrosto morto coll'odore dell'aglio e del ramerino)    Cook the meat as above, but add a clove of garlic and one or two bunches  of rosemary in the saucepan. When serving the roast rub the gravy  through a sieve without pressing and surround the meat with potatoes or  vegetables cooked apart.    The leg of lamb comes very well in this way, baked in the oven.      132    BIRDS    (Arrosto di uccelli)    The best way to cook birds, and that nearly always used by the Italians,  is roasted at the spit. They must be spitted with a small slice of bread  between each bird. Also wrap each bird in very thin slices of bacon, in  such a way that it can be spitted with this covering. Mind to slice the  bacon almost as thin as paper. Pass some oil--only once--over when they  begin to brown, using a brush or a feather, and salt only once,  moderately.    Put on the fire when near to be served, otherwise they may get dry and  lose much of their flavor. The cooking is rapidly done if on a good  fire.      133    ROAST OF LAMB    (Arrosto d'agnello)    Take a leg of lamb and season it with salt, pepper, oil and a drop of  vinegar. Pierce it here and there with the point of a knife and leave it  like this for several hours. Also lard it with bay leaf or rosemary to  be removed when serving. The leg of lamb can be baked or, as the  Italians do, cooked at the spit.      134    LEG OF MUTTON    (Cosciotto di castrato arrosto)    Before cooking see that several days elapse after the animal has been  butchered. This, naturally, according to the temperature. Beat it well  with a wooden mallet, then skin and remove the middle bone, without  spoiling the meat. Then tie it and give it a good fire at the beginning,  covering the fire when half cooked. Let it cook in its own juice and in  a cup of broth strained to remove the fat; nothing else. Salt when it is  almost cooked, but see that it is neither too well done nor rare, just  medium. Serve with its juice apart in a sauce.      135    ROAST OF HARE    (Arrosto di lepre)    The part of the hare fitted for roast is the hind quarters, but the  limbs of this game are covered with little skins that must be carefully  removed, before cooking, without cutting the muscles.    Before roasting keep it soaking for twelve or fourteen hours in a liquid  prepared as follows: put on the fire in a kettle three tumblers of water  with half a tumbler of vinegar or less in proportion with the piece to  be cooked, three of four scallions chopped fine, one or two bay-leaves,  a bunch of parsley, a little salt and a pinch of pepper; make it boil  for five or six minutes, cool and pour when cold over the hare. When you  remove the latter from the liquid wipe it and lard it all with little  pieces of good bacon.    Cook on a low fire, salt it sufficiently and grease with cream and  nothing else. Never use the liver of the hare which, it is said, is very  indigestible.      136    POT ROAST LARDED    (Arrosto morto lardellato)    Take a piece short and thick of beef or veal, quite tender and weighing  about two pounds or a little more. Lard it with ham or bacon cut in  little pieces. Tie with a string and put it in a stewpan with a piece of  butter, one fourth of a middle-sized onion cut in two pieces, three or  four ribs of celery half an inch thick and as many slices of carrot.  Season with salt and pepper and when the meat begins to brown--turning  it often--pour over one cup of water and complete the cooking on a low  fire, leaving it to absorb great part of the gravy. See, however, that  it doesn't dry up and become black. When you send to the table strain  the juice that has remained and pour it on the meat, that may be  surrounded with potatoes cut in pieces or kept whole if small,  previously browned in butter or oil.      137    PIGEON SURPRISE    (Piccione a sorpresa)    The pigeon (or chicken) must be opened and stuffed with a cutlet of milk  veal. Of course this cutlet must be of proportionate size. Beat it well  to render it thinner and more tender, season with salt, pepper, a pinch  of spices and little pieces of butter, roll it and put inside the pigeon  sewing the opening. The liver and giblets of the pigeon can be cooked  apart in brown stock or in butter, after being chopped. With the  resulting gravy the cutlet can be smeared. In this way the different  flavor of the two qualities of meat is better amalgamated.      138    STUFFED BEEF CUTLET    (Braciuola di manzo ripiena)    The ingredients for this dish are a slice of beef half an inch thick,  weighing about one pound, half a pound or less of lean milk veal, two  small slices of ham and two or three of tongue, one scant tablespoonful  of grated cheese, a piece of butter, two chicken livers, one egg, a  crumb of bread as large as a closed fist.    Make a hash with a small onion, a little celery, carrot and parsley, put  it on the fire with the butter and when it is browned, place in the  saucepan the veal cut in small pieces and the chicken livers, season  with little salt and pepper and complete the cooking with a little  broth. Remove the veal and chicken when cooked, and chop them fine. In  the gravy that remains make a pap rather hard with the crumb of bread,  moistening with broth if necessary. Now mix the chopped meat, the pap,  the eggs, the cheese, the ham and tongue cut in little pieces. When the  stuffing is composed thus, dip the cutlet in water, in order to stretch  it better, beat it with the back of the knife and flatten with its  blades. Put the stuffing inside and roll up and tie tightly with a  string crosswise. Roast or bake with oil and salt.      139    STUFFED CHICKEN    (Pollo ripieno)    For a middle-sized fowl use the following ingredients: two sausages, the  liver and giblets of the fowl, eight or ten chestnuts well roasted, some  pieces of mushrooms, a taste of nutmeg, one egg. If, instead of a fowl,  it is a turkey, double the dose.    Begin by giving the sausages and the giblets half a cooking, moistening  them with a little broth if necessary.

At the annual rate  of increase, according to the United States Census, in the State of  Illinois, the wheat crop ought to have been about thirty millions of  bushels, and the corn crop about one hundred and thirty-eight million  bushels. Putting the cash value of wheat at $1.25, and that of corn at  50 cents, the cash value of the corn and wheat destroyed by this  insignificant little bug, no bigger than a grain of rice, in one single  State and one single year, will therefore, according to the above  figures, foot up to the astounding total of _over seventy-three millions  of dollars_!\"    The imported cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae), recently introduced from  Europe, is estimated by the Abbe Provatncher, a Canadian entomologist,  to destroy annually two hundred and forty thousand dollars' worth of  cabbages around Quebec. The Hessian fly, according to Dr. Fitch,  destroyed fifteen million dollars' worth of wheat in New York State in  one year (1854). The army worm of the North (Leucania unipuncta), which  was so abundant in 1861, from New England to Kansas, was reported to  have done damage that year in Eastern Massachusetts exceeding half a  million of dollars. The joint worm (Isosoma hordei) alone sometimes cuts  off whole fields of grain in Virginia and northward. The Colorado potato  beetle is steadily moving eastward, now ravaging the fields in Indiana  and Ohio, and only the forethought and ingenuity in devising means of  checking its attacks, resulting from a thorough study of its habits,  will deliver our wasted fields from its direful assaults.    These are the injuries done by the more abundant kinds of insects  injurious to crops. We should not forget that each fruit or shade tree,  garden shrub or vegetable, has a host of insects peculiar to it, and  which, year after year, renew their attacks. I could enumerate upwards  of fifty species of insects which prey upon cereals and grass, and as  many which infest our field crops. Some thirty well known species ravage  our garden vegetables. There are nearly fifty species which attack the  grape vine, and their number is rapidly increasing. About seventy-five  species make their annual onset upon the apple tree, and nearly an equal  number may be found upon the plum, pear, peach and cherry. Among our  shade trees, over fifty species infest the oak; twenty-five the elm;  seventy-five the walnut, and over one hundred species of insects prey  upon the pine.    Indeed, we may reasonably calculate the annual loss in our country  alone, from noxious animals and the lower forms of plants, such as rust,  smut and mildew, as (at a low estimate) not far from five hundred  million dollars annually. Of this amount, at least one-tenth, or fifty  million dollars, could probably be saved by human exertions.    To save a portion of this annual loss of food stuffs, fruits and lumber,  should be the first object of farmers and gardeners. When this saving is  made, farming will become a profitable and safe profession. But while a  few are well informed as to the losses sustained by injurious insects,  and use means to ward off their attacks, their efforts are constantly  foiled by the negligence of their neighbors. As illustrated so well by  the history of the incursions of the army worm and canker worm, it is  only by a combination between farmers and orchardists that these and  other pests can be kept under. The matter can be best reached by  legislation. We have fish and game laws; why should we not have an  insect law? Why should we not frame a law providing that farmers, and  all owning a garden or orchard, should cooperate in taking preventive  measures against injurious insects, such as early or late planting of  cereals, to avert the attacks of the wheat midge and Hessian fly; the  burning of stubble in the autumn and spring to destroy the joint worm;  the combined use of proper remedies against the canker worm, the  various cut worms, and other noxious caterpillars? A law carried out by  a proper State entomological constabulary, if it may be so designated,  would compel the idle and shiftless to clear their farms and gardens of  noxious animals.    [Illustration: 46. Pickle Worm and its Moth.]    Among some of the injurious insects reported on by Mr. Riley, the State  Entomologist of Missouri, is a new pest to the cucumber in the West, the  Pickle worm (Phacellura nitidalis, Fig. 46). This is a caterpillar which  bores into the cucumbers when large enough to pickle, and which is  occasionally found in pickles. Three or four worms sometimes occur in a  cucumber, and in the garden a single one will cause it to rot. One of  the most troublesome intruders in our graperies is the Vine dresser  (Choerocampa pampinatrix, Fig. 47, larva and pupa; Fig. 48, adult), a  single caterpillar of which will sometimes \"strip a small vine of its  leaves in a few nights,\" and occasionally nips off bunches of half-grown  grapes.    [Illustration: 48. Vine Dresser Moth.    47. Vine Dresser and Chrysalis.]    Another caterpillar, which is sometimes so abundant as nearly to  defoliate the grape vine, is the eight spotted Alypia (Fig. 49; _a_,  larva; _b_, side view of a segment). This must not be confounded with  the bluish larva of the Wood Nymph, Eudryas grata (Fig. 50), which  differs from the Alypia caterpillar in being bluish, and in wanting the  white patches on the side of the body, and the more prominent hump on  the end of the body. Another moth (Psychomorpha epimenis, Fig. 51,  _a_, larva; _b_, side view of a segment; _c_, top view of the hump),  also feeds on the grape, eating the terminal buds. It is also bluish,  and wants the orange bands on the side of the body. Another moth of this  family is the American Procris (Acoloithus Americana, Fig. 52_a_, larva;  _b_, pupa; _c_, cocoon; _d_, _e_, imago); a dark blue moth, with a deep  orange collar, whose black and yellow caterpillar is gregarious (Fig.  53), living in companies of a dozen or more and eating the softer parts  of the leaves. It is quite common in the Western and Southern States.  The figure represents two separate broods of caterpillars feeding on  either side of the midrib of the leaf. But if the moths are, as a rule,  the enemies of our crops, there are the silk worms of the East and  Southern Europe and California, which afford the means of support to  multitudes of the poorer classes, and supply one of the most valuable  articles of clothing. Blot out the silk worm, and we should remove one  of the most important sources of national wealth, the annual revenue  from the silk trade of the world amounting to $254,500,000.    [Illustration: 49. Eight-spotted Alypia and Larva.]    [Illustration: 50. Eudryas grata.]    [Illustration: 51. Larva of Psychomorpha.]    [Illustration: 52. American Procris and Young.]    [Illustration: 53. Larvae of American Procris.]    Silk culture is rapidly assuming importance in California, and though  the Chinese silk worm has not been successfully cultivated in the  Eastern States, yet the American silk worm, Teleas Polyphemus (see  frontispiece, male; Fig. 54, larva; 55, pupa; 56, cocoon), can, we are  assured by Mr. Trouvelot, be made a source of profit.    This is a splendid member of the group of which the gigantic Attacus  Atlas of China is a type. It is a large, fawn colored moth with a tawny  tinge; the caterpillar is pale green, and is of the size indicated in  the cut. Mr. Trouvelot says that of the several kinds of silk worms, the  larva of the present species alone deserves attention. The cocoons of  Platysamia Cecropia may be rendered of some commercial value, as the  silk can be carded, but the chief objection is the difficulty of raising  the larva.    \"The Polyphemus worm spins a strong, dense, oval cocoon, which is closed  at each end, while the silk has a very strong and glossy fibre.\" Mr.  Trouvelot, from whose interesting account in the first volume of the  \"American Naturalist\" we quote, says that in 1865 \"not less than a  million could be seen feeding in the open air upon bushes covered with a  net; five acres of woodland were swarming with caterpillar life.\" The  bushes were scrub oaks, the worms being protected by a net. After  meeting with such great success Mr. Trouvelot lost all his worms by  pebrine, the germs being imported in eggs received from Japan through M.  Guerin-Meneville of Paris. Enough, however, was done to prove that silk  raising can be carried on profitably, when due precautions are taken, as  far north as Boston. As this moth extends to the tropics, it can be  reared with greater facility southwards. The cocoon is strong and dense,  and closed at each end, so that the thread is continuous, while the silk  has a very strong and glossy fibre.    [Illustration: 54. American Silk Worm.]    Next in value to the American silk worm, is the Ailanthus silk worm  (Samia Cynthia) a species allied to our Callosamia Promethea. It  originated from China, where it is cultivated, and was introduced into  Italy in 1858, and thence spread into France, where it was introduced by  M. Guerin-Meneville. Its silk is said to be much stronger than the fibre  of cotton, and is a mean between fine wool and ordinary silk. The worm  is very hardy, and can be reared in the open air both in this country  and in Europe. The main drawback to its culture is the difficulty in  unreeling the tough cocoon, and the shortness of the thread, the cocoon  being open at one end.    The Yama-mai moth (Antheraea Yama-mai) was introduced into France from  Japan in 1861. It is closely allied to the Polyphemus moth, and its  caterpillar also feeds on the oak.
