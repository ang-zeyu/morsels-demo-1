Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it  was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat  heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a  thing.    [Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]    At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth  swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and  considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a  shovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family  drew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half  a one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.  Two tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.    These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden  goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while  the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob  proposed:    'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'    Which all the family re-echoed.    'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.    He sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held  his withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to  keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.    'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell  me if Tiny Tim will live.'    'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney corner,  and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows  remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'    'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'    'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'  returned the Ghost, 'will find him here. What then? If he be like to  die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.'    Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and  was overcome with penitence and grief.    'Man,' said the Ghost, 'if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear  that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is, and  where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It  may be that, in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit  to live than millions like this poor man's child. O God! to hear the  insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry  brothers in the dust!'    Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and, trembling, cast his eyes  upon the ground. But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name.    'Mr. Scrooge!' said Bob. 'I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the  Feast!'    'The Founder of the Feast, indeed!' cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. 'I  wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and  I hope he'd have a good appetite for it.'    'My dear,' said Bob, 'the children! Christmas Day.'    'It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,' said she, 'on which one drinks  the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr.  Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do,  poor fellow!'    'My dear!' was Bob's mild answer. 'Christmas Day.'    'I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,' said Mrs. Cratchit,  'not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year!  He'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!'    The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their  proceedings which had no heartiness in it. Tiny Tim drank it last of  all, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the  family. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which  was not dispelled for full five minutes.    After it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before, from  the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit  told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which  would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two  young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man  of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from  between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular  investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that  bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's,  then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she  worked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for  a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how  she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord  'was much about as tall as Peter'; at which Peter pulled up his collar  so high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All  this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by  they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny  Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.    There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;  they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;  their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely  did, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful,  pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they  faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's  torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny  Tim, until the last.    By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as  Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the  roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was  wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a  cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,  and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.  There, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to  meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the  first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of  guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and  fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near  neighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them  enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!    But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to  friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to  give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting  company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how  the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its  capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its  bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very  lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of  light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out  loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that  he had any company but Christmas.    And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a  bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast  about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread  itself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost  that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,  rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery  red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,  and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of  darkest night.    'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.    'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'  returned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'    A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced  towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a  cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and  woman, with their children and their children's children, and another  generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.  The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind  upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a  very old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined  in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got  quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank  again.    The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,  passing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To  Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful  range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the  thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the  dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.    Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,  on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there  stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,  and storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the  water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.    But, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that  through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of  brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough  table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their  can of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged  and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might  be--struck up a sturdy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24025"],[0,"The New Girl at St. Chad's: A Story of School Life (#11)"],[1,"skirts and best sailor hats,  with their house colours, the blue ribbons of the School House leading  the way, followed by the pink of St. Aldwyth's, and the orange, violet,  and scarlet of St. Chad's, St. Bride's, and St. Hilary's, respectively.    \"I believe it's considered one of the sights of the neighbourhood to  see us parade through the lich-gate,\" said Lettice Talbot, who happened  to be walking with Honor. \"Visitors stand in the churchyard and try to  count us. They make the most absurd remarks sometimes; I suppose they  think we shan't overhear what they say. Really, they seem to look upon  us as a kind of show, and I quite expect we shall be put down in the  next edition of the guide-book as one of the attractions of Dunscar. Of  course, we take no notice. We walk along with our noses in the air, as  if we weren't aware that anyone was even thinking of us; but all the  same we feel giggles inside when we catch a whisper: 'They look like  angels dressed in white!' or, 'What a pile of washing they must make!'\"    Honor had been looking forward immensely to this Sunday morning, for  she hoped she might have an opportunity of seeing her brother Dermot,  who was at Dr. Winterton's school. Dermot was her favourite among her  five brothers, and the thought that Orley Grange and Chessington stood  only a mile and a half apart had so far been her one thread of comfort.  To catch even a distant glimpse of Dermot would be like a peep at home,  and she felt that a moment's talk with him would be sufficient to send  her back to St. Chad's rejoicing.    The students of the College occupied the whole of the left aisle of the  church, and the right aisle was reserved for Dr. Winterton's pupils. As  a rule, the girls arrived early and took their seats first; and they  always passed out by a side door, so that they seldom met the boys in  the churchyard. Should they happen to do so, however, it was etiquette  to take no notice of them, even though some might be relations, or  intimate friends. Honor was unaware of this rule, which her classmates,  not knowing she had a brother at the Grange, had not thought of  mentioning to her.    On this particular Sunday either Miss Cavendish or Dr. Winterton had  slightly miscalculated the time, for the two schools arrived at exactly  the same minute. As there was not room for all to march in together  through the lich-gate, the boys were drawn up like a regiment, and  waited for the College to go by. The girls sailed past with well-bred  unconsciousness, their eyes fixed discreetly upon the Prayer Books and  hymn-books that they carried--all except poor impulsive, unconventional  Honor, who made a sudden dart out of the line, and snatched rapturously  at a brown-faced, curly-headed boy, by his coat sleeve.    \"Dermot! Dermot! I _am_ glad to see you!\" she exclaimed, in a voice that  could be heard from end to end of the ranks.    \"Oh, I say, Honor! Stow it!\" murmured the boy in an agonized tone,  turning as red as fire, and trying to back away from her.    Naturally Honor's unexpected and unprecedented act caused a great  sensation. Lettice Talbot stopped when deserted by her partner, and the  girls behind her were obliged to halt too. All wondered what had  happened, and, in spite of their excellent training and good  discipline, their curiosity got the better of them, and they craned  their necks to look. Miss Farrar saved the situation by hurrying to  Honor, seizing her by the shoulder, and forcing her back into her  place; then the long line once more moved forward, and the  Chessingtonians, slightly ruffled, but trying to carry off the affair  in a dignified fashion, marched with admirable coolness into the  church. If Honor had a little, surreptitious cry behind her Prayer  Book, she managed to conceal the fact from the neighbours on either  side of her in the pew; and if her eyes looked suspiciously red, and  there was a slight tendency to chokiness in her voice as she walked  home after service, Lettice Talbot, at any rate, was tactful enough to  take no notice, though she seized the opportunity of explaining the  school code of decorum, and was severe in her censure.    \"You ought to have told me before,\" said Honor. \"How could I know that  I mustn't speak to my own brother?\"    \"I didn't even know you had a brother,\" returned Lettice; \"and I never  dreamt you'd do such an idiotic thing as rush at him like that. He  evidently didn't appreciate it.\"    \"No! I thought he'd be more glad to see me,\" gulped Honor, not the  least part of whose trouble had been Dermot's cold reception of her  enthusiastic greeting.    \"How silly you are! Does any boy care to parade his sister before his  whole school? I expect he'll get tremendously chaffed about this, poor  fellow! Really, Paddy, you ought to know better!\"    Considerably chastened by Lettice's crushing remarks, Honor subsided  into silence, and only reopened the subject when, in company with Janie  Henderson, she had retired after dinner to a spot overlooking the  playing-fields. It was a warm, beautiful afternoon, a day when you  could almost hear the buds bursting and the flowers opening. The two  girls spread their jerseys on the grass, and sat basking in the  sunshine, watching a lark soar up into the blue overhead, or the  seagulls flapping leisurely round the cliffs; or listening to the caw  of the jackdaws that, in company with a flock of starlings, were  feeding in a neighbouring ploughed field. The sea lay a sparkling sheet  of pearly grey, and Honor looked wistfully at its broad expanse when  she remembered that its farther waves washed the rocky shores of  Ireland.    Janie was the only girl at St. Chad's to whom she cared to mention her  home. With the others she could exchange jokes, but not confidences;  and though she returned their banter with interest, she did not look to  them for sympathy. Janie seemed altogether different from the rest; she  never laughed at Honor, and even if she remonstrated, it was in such a  gentle, apologetic way that the most touchy of Celtic natures could not  have taken offence.    Miss Maitland had not overlooked the episode of the morning. She had  had a few words to say after their return from church, and Honor, in  consequence, was feeling rather sore, and ready to pour out her  grievances into her friend's ears.    \"It's too bad!\" she declared. \"If you can't speak to your own brother,  to whom may you speak, I should like to know? It seems absurd that  Dermot should be living at the Grange, not two miles off, and yet we're  never to see one another. I thought I should at least meet him once a  week, and now I mayn't even say, 'How do you do?' without being scolded  as if I had committed a highway robbery.\"    \"Is he your favourite brother?\" asked Janie.    \"Yes; he's the nearest in age to me, and we're great chums. We have the  wildest fun during the holidays--we dare each other to do the maddest  things we can think of!\"    \"What kind of things?\"    \"Well, one day, when old Biddy Macarthy was ill with quinsy, we got up  early and took her cart to Ballycroghan market, and Dermot sold all her  chickens for her. He talked away like a Cheap Jack, and made such fun,  people nearly died with laughing. You see, most of them knew who he  was, and it seemed so absurd to hear him proclaiming the virtues of  Biddy's fowls. Then we filled the cart with seed potatoes, as a present  for her; and tore home so fast that the traces broke, and the donkey  ran straight out of the shafts. We fell on the road, nearly buried in  potatoes, but luckily we weren't hurt. We managed to catch the donkey,  and to mend the traces with a piece of string; then we had to put all  the potatoes back. Biddy laughed so much when we told her about the  adventure that it cured her quinsy; and she said she never had such a  splendid crop of potatoes as from those we brought her that day from  Ballycroghan. That was Dermot's joke; but I think mine was quite as  much fun.\"    \"What was yours?\"    \"I saved up my pocket-money to get a little pig, to give to old Micky,  the cobbler. Dermot and I walked over to Ennisfellen fair to buy it,  and drove it home with a string tied to its leg. As fast as we pulled  one way it ran another, and just as we got to Micky's cabin the string  snapped, and off the pig bolted down the village, and ran straight into  the open door of the school. The children chased it round and round  beneath the forms, and caught it at last under the master's desk. Oh,  we have lively times at Kilmore! Then once Dermot and I ran away, and  went to see Cousin Theresa at Slieve Donnell. Nobody knew where we were  for two days, and people were hunting all over the country for us. They  thought we must have been drowned, or have fallen into the bog.\"    \"But weren't your father and mother fearfully anxious?\" asked Janie,  who had listened almost aghast to the recital of those wild escapades.    \"Well, Father was rather cross about that, certainly. He was never  really very angry, though, until the last time, when I----\"    But here Honor stopped. On the whole, she decided she would not relate  the story of Firefly. She could not quite understand the expression on  Janie's face, and she began to doubt whether her friend would  altogether sympathize with her. Instead, she plunged into a detailed  description of her elder brothers, telling how two were preparing for  the Army at Sandhurst, how another was at Oxford, and the fourth was  studying law.    \"I suppose you are nearly always with your mother, as you are the only  girl,\" said Janie.    \"Well, no,\" admitted Honor. \"She's so delicate, and so often ill. I'm  afraid I give her a headache.\"    \"My mother is delicate too,\" confided Janie. \"She has most dreadful  neuralgia sometimes. I bathe her head with eau-de-cologne, mixed with  very hot water, and it always does her good. She calls me her little  nurse. Have you ever tried hot water with eau-de-c"]]]
