Lee (#11)"],[1,"22, 1861.    \"My Darling Daughters: I have just received your joint letter of October  24th from 'Clydale.' It was very cheering to me, and the affection and  sympathy you expressed were very grateful to my feelings. I wish indeed  I could see you, be with you, and never again part from you. God only  can give me that happiness. I pray for it night and day. But my prayers  I know are not worthy to be heard. I received your former letter in  western Virginia, but had no opportunity to reply to it. I enjoyed it,  nevertheless. I am glad you do not wait to hear from me, as that would  deprive me of the pleasure of hearing from you often. I am so pressed  with business. I am much pleased at your description of Stratford and  your visit. It is endeared to me by many recollections, and it has been  always a great desire of my life to be able to purchase it. Now that we  have no other home, and the one we so loved has been foully polluted,  the desire is stronger with me than ever. The horse-chestnut you mention  in the garden was planted by my mother. I am sorry the vault is so  dilapidated. You did not mention the spring, on of the objects of my  earliest recollections. I am very glad, my precious Agnes, that you  have become so early a riser. It is a good habit, and in these times for  mighty works advantage should be taken of every hour. I much regretted  being obliged to come from Richmond without seeing your poor mother....  This is my second visit to Savannah. I have been down the coast to  Amelia Island to examine the defenses. They are poor indeed, and I have  laid off work enough to employ our people a month. I hope our enemy will  be polite enough to wait for us. It is difficult to get our people to  realise their position.... Good-bye, my dear daughters.    \"Your affectionate father,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    To his daughter Annie:    \"Coosawhatchie, South Carolina, December 8, 1861.    \"My Precious Annie: I have taken the only quiet time I have been able to  find on this holy day to thank you for your letter of the 29th ulto. One  of the miseries of war is that there is no Sabbath, and the current of  work and strife has no cessation. How can we be pardoned for all our  offenses! I am glad that you have joined your mamma again and that some  of you are together at last. It would be a great happiness to me were  you all at some quiet place, remote from the vicissitudes of war,  where I could consider you safe. You must have had a pleasant time at  'Clydale.' I hope indeed that 'Cedar Grove' may be saved from the ruin  and pillage that other places have received at the hands of our enemies,  who are pursuing the same course here as the have practised elsewhere.  Unfortunately, too, the numerous deep estuaries, all accessible to their  ships, expose the multitude of islands to their predatory excursions,  and what they leave is finished by the negroes whose masters have  deserted their plantations, subject to visitations of the enemy. I am  afraid Cousin Julia [Mrs. Richard Stuart] will not be able to defend  her home if attacked by the vandals, for they have little respect for  anybody, and if they catch the Doctor [Doctor Richard Stuart] they  will certainly send him to Fort Warren or La Fayette. I fear, too, the  Yankees will bear off their pretty daughters. I am very glad you visited  'Chatham' [the home of the Fitzhughs, where my grandmother Custis was  born]. I was there many years ago, when it was the residence of Judge  Coulter, and some of the avenues of poplar, so dear to your grandmama,  still existed. I presume they have all gone now. The letter that you and  Agnes wrote from 'Clydale' I replied to and sent to that place. You know  I never have any news. I am trying to get a force to make headway on our  defenses, but it comes in very slow. The people do not seem to realise  that there is a war.    \"It is very warm here, if that is news, and as an evidence I inclose  some violets I plucked in the yard of a deserted house I occupy. I wish  I could see you and give them in person.... Good-bye, my precious child.  Give much love to everybody, and believe me,    \"Your affectionate father,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    From the same place, on December 2d, he writes to my mother:    \"I received last night, dear Mary, your letter of the 12th, and  am delighted to learn that you are all well and so many of you are  together. I am much pleased that Fitzhugh has an opportunity to be with  you all and will not be so far removed from his home in his new field  of action. I hope to see him at the head of a find regiment and that he  will be able to do good service in the cause of his country. If Mary and  Rob get to you Christmas, you will have quite a family party, especially  if Fitzhugh is not obliged to leave his home and sweet wife before that  time. I shall think of you all on that holy day more intensely than  usual, and shall pray to the great God of Heaven to shower His blessings  upon you in this world, and to unite you all in His courts in the world  to come. With a grateful heart I thank Him for His preservation thus  far, and trust to His mercy and kindness for the future. Oh, that I were  more worthy, more thankful for all He has done and continues to do for  me! Perry and Meredith [his two coloured servants] send their respects  to all....    \"Truly and affectionately,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    From the same place, on Christmas Day, he writes to my mother:    \"I cannot let this day of grateful rejoicing pass, dear Mary, without  some communication with you. I am thankful for the many among the past  that I have passed with you, and the remembrance of them fills me with  pleasure. For those on which we have been separated we must not repine.  Now we must be content with the many blessings we receive. If we can  only become sensible of our transgressions, so as to be fully penitent  and forgiven, that this heavy punishment under which we labour may  with justice be removed from us and the whole nation, what a gracious  consummation of all that we have endured it will be!    \"I hope you had a pleasant visit to Richmond.... If you were to see this  place, I think you would have it, too. I am here but little myself. The  days I am not here I visit some point exposed to the enemy, and after  our dinner at early candle-light, am engaged in writing till eleven or  twelve o'clock at night.... AS to our old home, if not destroyed, it  will be difficult ever to be recognised. Even if the enemy had wished  to preserve it, it would almost have been impossible. With the number  of troops encamped around it, the change of officers, etc., the want of  fuel, shelter, etc., and all the dire necessities of war, it is vain  to think of its being in a habitable condition. I fear, too, books,  furniture, and the relics of Mount Vernon will be gone. It is better  to make up our minds to a general loss. They cannot take away the  remembrance of the spot, and the memories of those that to us rendered  it sacred. That will remain to us as long as life will last, and that  we can preserve. In the absence of a home, I wish I could purchase  'Stratford.' That is the only other place that I could go to, now  accessible to us, that would inspire me with feelings of pleasure and  local love. You and the girls could remain there in quiet. It is a poor  place, but we could make enough cornbread and bacon for our support, and  the girls could weave us clothes. I wonder if it is for sale and at how  much. Ask Fitzhugh to try to find out, when he gets to Fredericksburg.  You must not build your hopes on peace on account of the United States  going into a war with England [on account of the Trent affair]. She will  be very loath to do that, notwithstanding the bluster of the Northern  papers. Her rulers are not entirely mad, and if they find England is  in earnest, and that war or a restitution of their captives must be the  consequence, they will adopt the latter. We must make up our minds to  fight our battles and win our independence alone. No one will help  us. We require no extraneous aid, if true to ourselves. But we must be  patient. It is not a light achievement and cannot be accomplished at  once.... I wrote a few days since, giving you all the news, and have now  therefore nothing to relate. The enemy is still quiet and increasing in  strength. We grow in size slowly but are working hard. I have had a day  of labour instead of rest, and have written intervals to some of the  children. I hope they are with you, and inclose my letters....    \"Affectionately and truly,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    In the next letter to my mother he describes a visit to the grave of  his father at Dungeness, on Cumberland Island, Georgia. Dungeness  was presented to General Nathaniel Green by the State of Georgia for  services rendered her in the Revolution. General Henry Lee, returning  from the West Indies, where he had been for some months on account of  his health, landed there, and in a few days died, March 15, 1818. He  was most kindly cared for by the daughter of his old commander, and  was buried there in the garden of Dungeness. At the time of my father's  visit the place belonged to a great-nephew of General Green, Mr.  Nightingale.    \"Coosawhatchie, South Carolina, January 18, 1862.    \"On my return, day before yesterday, from Florida, dear Mary, I received  your letter of the 1st inst. I am very glad to find that you had a  pleasant family meeting Christmas, and that it was so large. I am truly  grateful for all the mercies we enjoy, notwithstanding the miseries of  war, and join heartily in the wish that the next year may find us  at peace with all the world. I am delighted to hear that our little  grandson [his first grandchild--son of my brother Fitzhugh. He died in  1863] is improving so fast and is becoming such a perfect gentleman. May  his path be strewn with flowers and his life with happiness. I am very  glad to hear also that his dear papa is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23245"],[0,"Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan (#11)"],[1,"led,      And still that lean, persistent dog      At distance, like some spirit wailed,      Safe in the cover of a fog.      His nerves unstrung, with many a shout      He strove to frighten it away,      It would not go,--but roamed about,      Howling, as wolves howl for their prey.        Worried and almost in a rage,      One magic shaft at last he sent,      A sample of his science sage,      To quiet but the noises meant.      Unerring to its goal it flew,      No death ensued, no blood was dropped,      But by the hush the young man knew      At last that howling noise had stopped.        It happened on this very day      That the Pandava princes came      With all the Kuru princes gay      To beat the woods and hunt the game.      Parted from others in the chase,      Arjuna brave the wild dog found,--      Stuck still the shaft,--but not a trace      Of hurt, though tongue and lip were bound.        \"Wonder of wonders! Didst not thou      O Dronacharjya, promise me      Thy crown in time should deck my brow      And I be first in archery?      Lo! here, some other thou hast taught      A magic spell,--to all unknown;      Who has in secret from thee bought      The knowledge, in this arrow shown!\"        Indignant thus Arjuna spake      To his great Master when they met--      \"My word, my honour, is at stake,      Judge not, Arjuna, judge not yet.      Come, let us see the dog,\"--and straight      They followed up the creature's trace.      They found it, in the selfsame state,      Dumb, yet unhurt,--near Buttoo's place.        A hut,--a statue,--and a youth      In the dim forest,--what mean these?      They gazed in wonder, for in sooth      The thing seemed full of mysteries.      \"Now who art thou that dar'st to raise      Mine image in the wilderness?      Is it for worship and for praise?      What is thine object? speak, confess.\"        \"Oh Master, unto thee I came      To learn thy science. Name or pelf      I had not, so was driven with shame,      And here I learn all by myself.      But still as Master thee revere,      For who so great in archery!      Lo, all my inspiration here,      And all my knowledge is from thee.\"        \"If I am Master, now thou hast      Finished thy course, give me my due.      Let all the past, be dead and past,      Henceforth be ties between us new.\"      \"All that I have, O Master mine,      All I shall conquer by my skill,      Gladly shall I to thee resign,      Let me but know thy gracious will.\"        \"Is it a promise?\" \"Yea, I swear      So long as I have breath and life      To give thee all thou wilt.\" \"Beware!      Rash promise ever ends in strife.\"      \"Thou art my Master,--ask! oh ask!      From thee my inspiration came,      Thou canst not set too hard a task,      Nor aught refuse I, free from blame.\"        \"If it be so,--Arjuna hear!\"      Arjuna and the youth were dumb,      \"For thy sake, loud I ask and clear,      Give me, O youth, thy right-hand thumb.      I promised in my faithfulness      No equal ever shall there be      To thee, Arjuna,--and I press      For this sad recompense--for thee.\"        Glanced the sharp knife one moment high,      The severed thumb was on the sod,      There was no tear in Buttoo's eye,      He left the matter with his God.      \"For this,\"--said Dronacharjya,--\"Fame      Shall sound thy praise from sea to sea,      And men shall ever link thy name      With Self-help, Truth, and Modesty.\"          VII.    SINDHU.      PART I.        Deep in the forest shades there dwelt        A _Muni_ and his wife,      Blind, gray-haired, weak, they hourly felt        Their slender hold on life.        No friends had they, no help or stay,        Except an only boy,      A bright-eyed child, his laughter gay,        Their leaf-hut filled with joy.        Attentive, duteous, loving, kind,        Thoughtful, sedate, and calm,      He waited on his parents blind,        Whose days were like a psalm.        He roamed the woods for luscious fruits,        He brought them water pure,      He cooked their simple mess of roots,        Content to live obscure.        To fretful questions, answers mild        He meekly ever gave,      If they reproved, he only smiled,        He loved to be their slave.        Not that to him they were austere,        But age is peevish still,      Dear to their hearts he was,--so dear,        That none his place might fill.        They called him Sindhu, and his name        Was ever on their tongue,      And he, nor cared for wealth nor fame,        Who dwelt his own among.        A belt of _Bela_ trees hemmed round        The cottage small and rude,      If peace on earth was ever found        'Twas in that solitude.      PART II.        Great Dasarath, the King of Oude,        Whom all men love and fear,      With elephants and horses proud        Went forth to hunt the deer.        Oh gallant was the long array!        Pennons and plumes were seen,      And swords that mirrored back the day,        And spears and axes keen.        Rang trump, and conch, and piercing fife,        Woke Echo from her bed!      The solemn woods with sounds were rife        As on the pageant sped.        Hundreds, nay thousands, on they went!        The wild beasts fled away!      Deer ran in herds, and wild boars spent        Became an easy prey.        Whirring the peacocks from the brake        With Argus wings arose,      Wild swans abandoned pool and lake        For climes beyond the snows.        From tree to tree the monkeys sprung,        Unharmed and unpursued,      As louder still the trumpets rung        And startled all the wood.        The porcupines and such small game        Unnoted fled at will,      The weasel only caught to tame        From fissures in the hill.        Slunk light the tiger from the bank,        But sudden turned to bay!      When he beheld the serried rank        That barred his tangled way.        Uprooting fig-trees on their path,        And trampling shrubs and flowers,      Wild elephants, in fear and wrath,        Burst through, like moving towers.        Lowering their horns in crescents grim        Whene'er they turned about,      Retreated into coverts dim        The bisons' fiercer rout.        And in this mimic game of war        In bands dispersed and past      The royal train,--some near, some far,        As day closed in at last.        Where was the king? He left his friends        At midday, it was known,      And now that evening fast descends        Where was he? All alone.        Curving, the river formed a lake,        Upon whose bank he stood,      No noise the silence there to break,        Or mar the solitude.        Upon the glassy surface fell        The last beams of the day,      Like fiery darts, that lengthening swell,        As breezes wake and play.        Osiers and willows on the edge        And purple buds and red,      Leant down,--and 'mid the pale green sedge        The lotus raised its head.        And softly, softly, hour by hour        Light faded, and a veil      Fell over tree, and wave, and flower,        On came the twilight pale.        Deeper and deeper grew the shades,        Stars glimmered in the sky,      The nightingale along the glades        Raised her preluding cry.        What is that momentary flash?        A gleam of silver scales      Reveals the _Mahseer_;--then a splash,        And calm again prevails.        As darkness settled like a pall        The eye would pierce in vain,      The fireflies gemmed the bushes all,        Like fiery drops of rain.        Pleased with the scene,--and knowing not        Which way, alas! to go,      The monarch lingered on the spot,--        The lake spread bright below.        He lingered, when--oh hark! oh hark        What sound salutes his ear!      A roebuck drinking in the dark,        Not hunted, nor in fear.        Straight to the stretch his bow he drew,        That bow ne'er missed its aim,      Whizzing the deadly arrow flew,        Ear-guided, on the game!        Ah me! What means this?--Hark, a cry,        A feeble human wail,      \"Oh God!\" it said--\"I die,--I die,        Who'll carry home the pail?\"        Startled, the monarch forward ran,        And then there met his view      A sight to freeze in any man        The warm blood coursing true.        A child lay dying on the grass,        A pitcher by his side,      Poor Sindhu was the child, alas!        His parents' stay and pride.        His bow and quiver down to fling,        And lift the wounded boy,      A moment's work was with the king.        Not dead,--that was a joy!        He placed the child's head on his lap,        And ranged the blinding hair,      The blood welled fearful from the gap        On neck and bosom fair.        He dashed cold water on the face,        He chafed the hands, with sighs,      Till sense revived, and he could trace        Expression in the eyes.        Then mingled with his pity, fear--        In all this universe      What is so dreadful as to hear        A Bramin's dying curse!        So thought the king, and on his brow        The beads of anguish spread,      And Sindhu, fully conscious now,        The anguish plainly read.        \"What dost thou fear, O mighty king?        For sure a king thou art!      Why should thy bosom anguish wring?        No crime was in thine heart!        \"Unwittingly the deed was done;        It is my destiny,      O fear not thou, but pity one        Whose fate is thus to die.        \"No curses, no!--I bear no grudge,        Not thou my blood hast spilt,      Lo! here before the unseen Judge,        Thee I absolve from guilt.        \"The iron, red-hot as it burns,        Burns those that touch it too,      Not such my nature,--for it spurns,        Thank God, the like to do.        \"Because I suffer, should I give        Thee, king, a needless pain?      Ah, no! I die, but mayst thou live,        And cleansed from every stain!\"        Struck"]]]
