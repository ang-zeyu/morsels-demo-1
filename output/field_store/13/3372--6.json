So I makes for up the country at the old jig-jog.       But it's time that I was movin', I've a mighty way to go     Till I drink artesian water from a thousand feet below;     Till I meet the overlanders with the cattle comin' down,     And I'll work a while till I make a pile, then have a spree in town.       So, it's shift, boys, shift, for there isn't the slightest doubt     We've got to make a shift to the stations further out;     The pack-horse runs behind us, for he follows like a dog,     And we cross a lot of country at the old jig-jog.          How Gilbert Died           There's never a stone at the sleeper's head,      There's never a fence beside,     And the wandering stock on the grave may tread      Unnoticed and undenied,     But the smallest child on the Watershed      Can tell you how Gilbert died.       For he rode at dusk, with his comrade Dunn      To the hut at the Stockman's Ford,     In the waning light of the sinking sun      They peered with a fierce accord.     They were outlaws both -- and on each man's head      Was a thousand pounds reward.       They had taken toll of the country round,      And the troopers came behind     With a black that tracked like a human hound      In the scrub and the ranges blind:     He could run the trail where a white man's eye      No sign of a track could find.       He had hunted them out of the One Tree Hill      And over the Old Man Plain,     But they wheeled their tracks with a wild beast's skill,      And they made for the range again.     Then away to the hut where their grandsire dwelt,      They rode with a loosened rein.       And their grandsire gave them a greeting bold:      'Come in and rest in peace,     No safer place does the country hold --      With the night pursuit must cease,     And we'll drink success to the roving boys,      And to hell with the black police.'       But they went to death when they entered there,      In the hut at the Stockman's Ford,     For their grandsire's words were as false as fair --      They were doomed to the hangman's cord.     He had sold them both to the black police      For the sake of the big reward.       In the depth of night there are forms that glide      As stealthy as serpents creep,     And around the hut where the outlaws hide      They plant in the shadows deep,     And they wait till the first faint flush of dawn      Shall waken their prey from sleep.       But Gilbert wakes while the night is dark --      A restless sleeper, aye,     He has heard the sound of a sheep-dog's bark,      And his horse's warning neigh,     And he says to his mate, 'There are hawks abroad,      And it's time that we went away.'       Their rifles stood at the stretcher head,      Their bridles lay to hand,     They wakened the old man out of his bed,      When they heard the sharp command:     'In the name of the Queen lay down your arms,      Now, Dunn and Gilbert, stand!'       Then Gilbert reached for his rifle true      That close at his hand he kept,     He pointed it straight at the voice and drew,      But never a flash outleapt,     For the water ran from the rifle breech --      It was drenched while the outlaws slept.       Then he dropped the piece with a bitter oath,      And he turned to his comrade Dunn:     'We are sold,' he said, 'we are dead men both,      But there may be a chance for one;     I'll stop and I'll fight with the pistol here,      You take to your heels and run.'       So Dunn crept out on his hands and knees      In the dim, half-dawning light,     And he made his way to a patch of trees,      And vanished among the night,     And the trackers hunted his tracks all day,      But they never could trace his flight.       But Gilbert walked from the open door      In a confident style and rash;     He heard at his side the rifles roar,      And he heard the bullets crash.     But he laughed as he lifted his pistol-hand,      And he fired at the rifle flash.       Then out of the shadows the troopers aimed      At his voice and the pistol sound,     With the rifle flashes the darkness flamed,      He staggered and spun around,     And they riddled his body with rifle balls      As it lay on the blood-soaked ground.       There's never a stone at the sleeper's head,      There's never a fence beside,     And the wandering stock on the grave may tread      Unnoticed and undenied,     But the smallest child on the Watershed      Can tell you how Gilbert died.          The Flying Gang           I served my time, in the days gone by,      In the railway's clash and clang,     And I worked my way to the end, and I      Was the head of the 'Flying Gang'.     'Twas a chosen band that was kept at hand      In case of an urgent need,     Was it south or north we were started forth,      And away at our utmost speed.       If word reached town that a bridge was down,        The imperious summons rang --       'Come out with the pilot engine sharp,        And away with the flying gang.'       Then a piercing scream and a rush of steam      As the engine moved ahead,     With a measured beat by the slum and street      Of the busy town we fled,     By the uplands bright and the homesteads white,      With the rush of the western gale,     And the pilot swayed with the pace we made      As she rocked on the ringing rail.       And the country children clapped their hands        As the engine's echoes rang,       But their elders said:  'There is work ahead        When they send for the flying gang.'       Then across the miles of the saltbush plain      That gleamed with the morning dew,     Where the grasses waved like the ripening grain      The pilot engine flew,     A fiery rush in the open bush      Where the grade marks seemed to fly,     And the order sped on the wires ahead,      The pilot _MUST_ go by.       The Governor's special must stand aside,        And the fast express go hang,       Let your orders be that the line is free        For the boys of the flying gang.          Shearing at Castlereagh           The bell is set a-ringing, and the engine gives a toot,     There's five and thirty shearers here are shearing for the loot,     So stir yourselves, you penners-up, and shove the sheep along,     The musterers are fetching them a hundred thousand strong,     And make your collie dogs speak up -- what would the buyers say     In London if the wool was late this year from Castlereagh?       The man that 'rung' the Tubbo shed is not the ringer here,     That stripling from the Cooma side can teach him how to shear.     They trim away the ragged locks, and rip the cutter goes,     And leaves a track of snowy fleece from brisket to the nose;     It's lovely how they peel it off with never stop nor stay,     They're racing for the ringer's place this year at Castlereagh.       The man that keeps the cutters sharp is growling in his cage,     He's always in a hurry and he's always in a rage --     'You clumsy-fisted mutton-heads, you'd turn a fellow sick,     You pass yourselves as shearers, you were born to swing a pick.     Another broken cutter here, that's two you've broke to-day,     It's awful how such crawlers come to shear at Castlereagh.'       The youngsters picking up the fleece enjoy the merry din,     They throw the classer up the fleece, he throws it to the bin;     The pressers standing by the rack are waiting for the wool,     There's room for just a couple more, the press is nearly full;     Now jump upon the lever, lads, and heave and heave away,     Another bale of golden fleece is branded 'Castlereagh'.          The Wind's Message           There came a whisper down the Bland between the dawn and dark,     Above the tossing of the pines, above the river's flow;     It stirred the boughs of giant gums and stalwart ironbark;     It drifted where the wild ducks played amid the swamps below;     It brought a breath of mountain air from off the hills of pine,     A scent of eucalyptus trees in honey-laden bloom;     And drifting, drifting far away along the southern line     It caught from leaf and grass and fern a subtle strange perfume.       It reached the toiling city folk, but few there were that heard --     The rattle of their busy life had choked the whisper down;     And some but caught a fresh-blown breeze with scent of pine that stirred     A thought of blue hills far away beyond the smoky town;     And others heard the whisper pass, but could not understand     The magic of the breeze's breath that set their hearts aglow,     Nor how the roving wind could bring across the Overland     A sound of voices silent now and songs of long ago.       But some that heard the whisper clear were filled with vague unrest;     The breeze had brought its message home, they could not fixed abide;     Their fancies wandered all the day towards the blue hills' breast,     Towards the sunny slopes that lie along the riverside,     The mighty rolling western plains are very fair to see,     Where waving to the passing breeze the silver myalls stand,     But fairer are the giant hills, all rugged though they be,     From which the two great rivers rise that run along the Bland.       Oh! rocky range and rugged spur and river running clear,     That swings around the sudden bends with swirl of snow-white foam,     Though we, your sons, are far away, we sometimes seem to hear     The message that the breezes bring to call the wanderers home.     The mountain peaks are white with snow that feeds a thousand rills,     Along the river banks the maize grows tall on virgin land,     And we shall live to see once more those sunny southern hills,     And strike once more the bridle track that leads along the Bland.          Johnson's Antidote           Down along the Snakebite River, where the overlanders camp,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21300"],[0,"Cowboy Songs, and Other Frontier Ballads (#11)"],[1,"of good whiskey to pass the time away.      A Union Pacific railway train was the next we did surprise,    And the crimes done by our bloody hands bring tears into my eyes.    The engineerman and fireman killed, the conductor escaped alive,    And now their bones lie mouldering beneath Nebraska's skies.      Then we saddled horses, northwestward we did go,    To the God-forsaken country called Min-ne-so-te-o;    I had my eye on the Northfield bank when brother Bob did say,    \"Now, Cole, if you undertake the job, you will surely curse the day.\"      But I stationed out my pickets and up to the bank did go,    And there upon the counter I struck my fatal blow.    \"Just hand us over your money and make no further delay,    We are the famous Younger brothers, we spare no time to pray.\"          MISSISSIPPI GIRLS        Come, all you Mississippi girls, and listen to my noise,    If you happen to go West, don't you marry those Texian boys;    For if you do, your fortune will be    Cold jonny-cake and beefsteak, that's all that you will see,--    Cold jonny-cake and beefsteak, that's all that you will see.      When they go courting, here's what they wear:    An old leather coat, and it's all ripped and tore;    And an old brown hat with the brim tore down,    And a pair of dirty socks, they've worn the winter round.      When one comes in, the first thing you hear    Is, \"Madam, your father has killed a deer\";    And the next thing they say when they sit down    Is, \"Madam, the jonny-cake is too damned brown.\"      They live in a hut with hewed log wall,    But it ain't got any windows at all;    With a clap-board roof and a puncheon floor,    And that's the way all Texas o'er.      They will take you out on a live-oak hill    And there they will leave you much against your will.    They will leave you on the prairie, starve you on the plains,    For that is the way with the Texians,--    For that is the way with the Texians.      When they go to preaching let me tell you how they dress;    Just an old black shirt without any vest,    Just an old straw hat more brim than crown    And an old sock leg that they wear the winter round,--    And an old sock leg that they wear the winter round.      For your wedding supper, there'll be beef and cornbread;    There it is to eat when the ceremony's said.    And when you go to milk you'll milk into a gourd;    And set it in the corner and cover it with a board;    Some gets little and some gets none,    For that is the way with the Texians,--    For that is the way with the Texians.          THE OLD MAN UNDER THE HILL        There was an old man who lived under the hill,    Chir-u-ra-wee, lived under the hill,    And if he ain't dead he's living there still,    Chir-u-ra-wee, living there still.      One day the old man went out to plow,    Chir-u-ra-wee, went out to plow;    'Tis good-bye the old fellow, and how are you now,    Sing chir-u-ra-wee, and how are you now.      And then another came to his house,    Chir-u-ra-wee, came to his house;    \"There's one of your family I've got to have now,    Sing chir-u-ra-wee, got to have now.      \"It's neither you nor your oldest son,    Chir-u-ra-wee, nor your oldest son.\"    \"Then take my old woman and take her for fun,    Sing chir-u-ra-wee, take her for fun.\"      He takened her all upon his back,    Chir-u-ra-wee, upon his back,    And like an old rascal went rickity rack,    Sing chir-u-ra-wee, went rickity rack.      But when he got half way up the road,    Chir-u-ra-wee, up the road,    Says he, \"You old lady, you're sure a load,\"    Sing chir-u-ra-wee, you're sure a load.      He set her down on a stump to rest,    Chir-u-ra-wee, stump to rest;    She up with a stick and hit him her best.    Sing chir-u-ra-wee, hit him her best.      He taken her on to hell's old gate,    Chir-u-ra-wee, hell's old gate,    But when he got there he got there too late,    Sing chir-u-ra-wee, got there too late.      And so he had to keep his wife,    Chir-u-ra-wee, had to keep his wife,    And keep her he did for the rest of his life.    Sing chir-u-ra-wee, for the rest of his life.          JERRY, GO ILE THAT CAR        Come all ye railroad section men an' listen to my song,    It is of Larry O'Sullivan who now is dead and gone.    For twinty years a section boss, he niver hired a tar--    Oh, it's \"j'int ahead and cinter back,    An' Jerry, go ile that car!\"        For twinty years a section boss, he niver hired a tar,      But it's \"j'int ahead an cinter back,      An' Jerry, go ile that car-r-r!\"      For twinty years a section boss, he worked upon the track,    And be it to his cred-i-it he niver had a wrack.    For he kept every j'int right up to the p'int wid the tap of the        tampin-bar-r-r;    And while the byes was a-swimmin' up the ties,    It's \"Jerry, wud yez ile that car-r-r!\"      God rest ye, Larry O'Sullivan, to me ye were kind and good;    Ye always made the section men go out and chop me wood;    An' fetch me wather from the well an' chop me kindlin' fine;    And any man that wouldn't lind a hand, 'twas Larry give        him his Time.      And ivery Sunday morni-i-ing unto the gang he'd say:    \"Me byes, prepare--yez be aware the ould lady goes to church the day.    Now, I want ivery man to pump the best he can, for the distance it        is far-r-r;    An' we have to get in ahead of number tin--    So, Jerry, go an' ile that car-r-r!\"      'Twas in November in the winter time and the ground all covered        wid snow,    \"Come put the hand-car-r-r on the track an' over the section go!\"    Wid his big soger coat buttoned up to his t'roat, all weathers he        would dare--    An' it's \"Paddy Mack, will yez walk the track,    An' Jerry, go an' ile that car-r-r!\"      \"Give my respects to the roadmas-ther,\" poor Larry he did cry,    \"An lave me up that I may see the ould hand-car before I die.    Come, j'int ahead an' cinter back,    An' Jerry, go an' ile that car-r-r!\"        Then lay the spike maul upon his chist, the gauge, and the ould           claw-bar-r-r,      And while the byes do be fillin' up his grave,      \"Oh, Jerry, go an' ile that car-r-r!\"          JOHN GARNER'S TRAIL HERD        Come all you old timers and listen to my song;    I'll make it short as possible and I'll not keep you long;    I'll relate to you about the time you all remember well    When we, with old Joe Garner, drove a beef herd up the trail.      When we left the ranch it was early in the spring,    We had as good a corporal as ever rope did swing,    Good hands and good horses, good outfit through and through,--    We went well equipped, we were a jolly crew.      We had no little herd--two thousand head or more--    And some as wild a brush beeves as you ever saw before.    We swung to them all the way and sometimes by the tail,--    Oh, you know we had a circus as we all went up the trail.      All things went on well till we reached the open ground,    And then them cattle turned in and they gave us merry hell.    They stampeded every night that came and did it without        fail,--    Oh, you know we had a circus as we all went up the trail.      We would round them up at morning and the boss would make a count,    And say, \"Look here, old punchers, we are out quite an amount;    You must make all losses good and do it without fail    Or you will never get another job of driving up the trail.\"      When we reached Red River we gave the Inspector the dodge.    He swore by God Almighty, in jail old John should lodge.    We told him if he'd taken our boss and had him locked in jail,    We would shore get his scalp as we all came down the trail.      When we reached the Reservation, how squirmish we did feel,    Although we had tried old Garner and knew him true as steel.    And if we would follow him and do as he said do,    That old bald-headed cow-thief would surely take us through.      When we reached Dodge City we drew our four months' pay.    Times was better then, boys, that was a better day.    The way we drank and gambled and threw the girls around,--    \"Say, a crowd of Texas cowboys has come to take our town.\"      The cowboy sees many hardships although he takes them well;    The fun we had upon that trip, no human tongue can tell.    The cowboy's life is a dreary life, though his mind it is no load,    And he always spends his money like he found it in the road.      If ever you meet old Garner, you must meet him on the square,    For he is the biggest cow-thief that ever tramped out there.    But if you want to hear him roar and spin a lively tale,    Just ask him about the time we all went up the trail.          THE OLD SCOUT'S LAMENT        Come all of you, my brother scouts,    And join me in my song;    Come, let us sing together    Though the shadows fall so long.      Of all the old frontiersmen    That used to scour the plain,    There are but very few of them    That with us yet remain.      Day after day they're dropping off,    They're going one by one;    Our clan is fast decreasing,    Our race is almost run.      There were many of our number    That never wore the blue,    But, faithfully, they did their part,    As brave men, tried and true.      They never joined the army,    But had other work to do    In piloting the coming folks,    To help them safely through.      But, brothers, we are falling,    Our race is almost run;    The days of elk and buffalo    And beaver traps are gone.      Oh, the days of elk and buffalo!    It fills my heart with pain    To know these days are past and gone    To never come again.      We fought the red-skin rascals    Over valley, hill, and plain;    We fought him in the mountain top,    And fought him down again.      These fighting days are over;    The Indian yell resounds    No more along the border;    Peace sends far sweeter sounds.      But we found great joy, old comrades,    To hear, and make it die;    We won bright homes for gentle ones,    And"]]]
