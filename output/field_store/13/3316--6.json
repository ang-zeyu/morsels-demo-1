[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20346"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Winchester (#11)"],[1," plainest description. The compartment of the triforium is very nearly of  the same height as that of the pier-arches, and the clerestory is also  nearly the same height.... Each pier-arch is formed of two orders or  courses of voussoirs, the edges of which are left square, wholly  undecorated by mouldings. This is the case with the pier-arches of Ely  transept, but in the arches of the triforium at Ely, and in every other  Norman part of that cathedral, the edges of the voussoirs are richly  moulded. In Winchester transept, on the contrary, the arches of the  triforium and clerestory are square-edged like those of the pier below  and hence arises the peculiarly simple and massive effect of this part  of the church.\" Between the tower-piers and the terminal walls of each  transept there are three piers, making four compartments, the farther  two of which from the nave and choir open into the terminal aisles. The  arches were all originally plain, semi-circular, and square-edged, and  are supported by shafts with the cushioned capitals so characteristic of  the ruder Norman style, and the bases are simple with a chamfer and  quarter-round, very different from the ornamental Late Norman bases,  such as may be seen at S. Cross, Winchester, for example. Where the  Later Norman work has taken the place of the original, we find stronger  piers. The vault above is groined, but there are no ribs. Nothing,  however, can now be seen of the vaulting above the level of the  side-walls, since a flat wooden ceiling, painted in \"Early Tudor\" style  was put up in 1818, by which, among other things, the rose-window in the  gable of the north transept was hidden, though in Britton's view, which  we give on page 59, we have the transept previous to the timbering. Each  transept has an eastern and a western aisle, while at the extreme ends  there are aisles rising to pier-arch level, consisting of two arches,  which a triple bearing-shaft supports in the centre. A kind of gallery  is formed at the terminations of the north and south transepts, over and  beyond which may be seen the triforium and clerestory windows. This can  best be appreciated by a reference to the illustration, Plate XV.  Possibly this platform or gallery was not originally so bare as it  appears at the present day, but there is no doubt that it was built in  order that processions might pass round on the triforium level.    It has been mentioned that when the tower was rebuilt the columns  nearest it in the transepts were strengthened. They now, indeed, present  a singularly massive outline to the eye, and contrast strongly even with  the remaining Norman pillars in the transepts. The arches also are  changed. All were once semi-circular, but the rebuilding necessitated a  change of the first and second from the actual tower-pier into the  stilted or \"horse-shoe\" form. They are doubly recessed (except those  supporting the end platform, which have but one soffit), and present  quite plain and unadorned square edges.    [Illustration: VIEW IN NORTH TRANSEPT. _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]    In each transept there is at the eastern angle a spiral staircase  leading up to the roof.    If we take first the #North Transept#, there will be found at the  southern end, against the side wall of the choir, and between the two  great tower-piers, the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, a small compartment  which contains some interesting and still distinct mural paintings on  the roof and walls, representing scenes of the Passion, etc. The most  striking is a large head and bust of Christ on the easternmost division  of the vaulting. One hand holds the Gospels, with the inscription _Salus  Populi Ego Sum_. On the wall beneath are the Descent from the Cross and  the Entombment. The Nativity and Annunciation also appear on the roof,  while on the walls are the Entry into Jerusalem, the Raising of Lazarus,  the Descent into Hell, and the Appearance to Mary Magdalene in the  Garden.    Two of the Norman piers on the eastern side of this transept have  received very elaborate canopies of the Decorated period, under which it  is probable that there were at one time altars. Some Early English work  may be seen in the heads carved on some of the larger shafts and the  caps of the subsidiary pillars, a noticeable figure being \"a monk  crouched in a caryatidal attitude and holding a chess-board.\"    The modern entry to the crypts is in the south-east interior wall of  this transept, the old means of entrance, through the \"Holy Hole,\"  having been blocked up.    The large tomb in the north transept is that of Prebendary Iremonger. On  the western wall, at the end of the transept, are very faint traces of  mural paintings, representing S. Christopher carrying Christ, etc., and  it is probable the transepts were once thus decorated throughout.    The #South Transept# has received far more additions to its interior  decorations than has the north. In the back of the choir-wall is  recessed Sir Isaac Townsend's memorial, not a very noteworthy object.  Just under it there now stands the old oak settle which was once used by  the Norman monks. In the central space of the transept itself is a large  monument to Bishop Wilberforce, showing beneath a canopy a life-sized  figure, with mitre, cope, and staff, on a slab borne by six kneeling  angels. A Latin inscription records his birth on 1st September 1805, and  his death on 19th July 1873. The monument is the work of Sir Gilbert  Scott, and has met with some severe attacks. It certainly is out of  place in its Norman surroundings. The aisles of the south transept are  divided up into six chambers, of which the larger of the two westernmost  is used as a chapter-room, and does not betray its age by its present  appearance; the one next the body of the church, Milner's \"ancient  sacristy,\" but now known as Henry of Blois' treasury, serves as a boys'  vestry. The Norman work over the door must not be overlooked. The  chamber to the extreme south is the entrance lobby to the south door,  which leads into the \"slype\" or passage running between the church and  the old chapter-house. Leading out of it is the ancient \"calefactory,\"  where the fire for the censers and thuribles was preserved. Panelled oak  screens enclose this room on both sides. Next it comes Silkstede's  chapel, the central of the three easterly divisions of the transept  aisles. The prior's rebus, in the form of a skein of silk, is evident  among the carvings, and his Christian name Thomas may be seen on the  cornice with the MA, the monogram of the Virgin, standing out  distinctly. The screen in this chapel is worthy of remark, and is  divided into four compartments, the upper part of each being open-work  and arched with pierced quatrefoils in the spandrels. In this chapel  traces of painting were discovered in 1848, beneath the whitewash on the  eastern wall, the subject apparently being Christ upon the water,  calling to him S. Peter, who, in an attitude of hesitation, holds the  prow of the boat. Fine canopy-work surmounts the whole. Originally there  were eight canopies enclosing figures, but little except the canopies  remain, the distemper-painting having almost vanished. On the floor of  the chapel may be found a black marble slab, the tomb of Isaak Walton,  with Bishop Ken's often-quoted inscription, which, however, it is  perhaps pardonable to quote again:--        \"Alas! Hee's gone before,      Gone, to returne noe more;      Our panting hearts aspire      After their aged Sire,      Whose well-spent life did last      Full ninety years, and past.      But now he hath begun      That which will nere be done:      Crown'd with eternal Blisse,      We wish our souls with his.\"    [Illustration: DOORWAY FROM THE CLOSE INTO THE RETRO-CHOIR.  From a Drawing by H.P. Clifford.]    [Illustration: BISHOP WILBERFORCE'S TOMB IN SOUTH TRANSEPT.  _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]    [Illustration: SOUTH AISLE, FROM TRANSEPT. _S.B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]    Next to Prior Silkstede's chapel comes the \"Venerable\" chapel, which  serves as a vestry for the minor canons of the cathedral. The screen of  this fills the whole archway, the six canopies extending beyond the  sweep of the arch. Down each side are untenanted niches, and the  openings of the tracery show some beautiful and elaborate iron-work,  dating from the Renaissance. A similar screen, though without canopies,  divides the Venerable Chapel from Silkstede's.    #The Library# is approached from an old wooden staircase in the south  aisle of this transept. It is a \"long, low room, with oaken presses  curiously carved and ornamented with gilded knobs, after the fashion of  the latter half of the seventeenth century.\" It contains three or four  thousand books, most of which are the gift of Bishop Morley, and there  are many fine MSS.; but its chief treasure is a Vulgate of the twelfth  century, in three folio volumes on vellum. The gorgeously illuminated  manuscript is the best work extant of the Winchester school, and the  fact that it was never finished renders it only the more interesting,  since thereby the whole process from the first outline to the final  touch of colour is evident. A legend concerning Hugh of Avalon,  afterwards Bishop of Lincoln (associated with this book), is worthy of  mention. Henry II., who founded the Carthusian Monastery of Witham, in  Somerset, had appointed Hugh prior in 1175 or 1176, and finding that his  monks needed MSS. to copy, and in particular a complete copy of the  Bible, promised to give them one. To avoid expense, he borrowed this  superb Vulgate from Winchester and sent it to Witham. A chance visit  long afterwards of a Winchester monk revealed what had happened, and on  the matter becoming known to Hugh, he returned the volume without the  king's knowledge.[4] Among other important MSS. in the Library are an  eleventh century copy of Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History\"; a twelfth  century \"Lif"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20348"],[0,"The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays (#11)"],[1,"Dixon turned and slightly winked at Miss Pennington.    \"That was one of your valuable rings, wasn't it, dear?\" asked Miss  Pennington, in deliberate tones.    \"It certainly was--the best diamond I had. I simply won't let it be  lost--or taken. I'm going to have it back!\"    She spoke in a loud tone, and the door of Estelle's room, farther down  the hall, opened. Estelle looked out. She was in negligee, and she  seemed to be suffering.    \"Has anything happened?\" she asked.    \"Yes,\" answered Miss Dixon. \"Something has happened. Some one has stolen  my diamond ring!\"    \"Oh!\" gasped Ruth, \"you shouldn't say that!\"    \"Say what?\"    \"Stolen. It's such a--such a harsh word.\"    \"Well, I feel harsh just now. I'm not going to lose that ring. It was on  my dresser when I went down to supper, and now it's gone. It was  stolen--or taken, if you like that word better. Perhaps you want me to  say it was--borrowed?\" and she looked scornfully at Ruth.    \"It may have slipped down behind your dresser.\"    \"I've looked,\" said Miss Pennington. \"You came up here from the table  before we did,\" she went on, addressing Estelle. \"Did you see anything  of any one in Miss Dixon's room?\"    \"I? No, I saw no one.\" Estelle was plainly taken by surprise.    \"Did you go in yourself,\" asked Miss Dixon brusquely. \"Come, I don't  mind a joke--if it was a joke--but give me back my ring. I'm going into  town, and I want to wear it.\"    \"A joke! Give you back your ring! Why, what do you mean?\" and Estelle,  her face flashing her indignation, stepped out into the hall.    \"I mean you might have borrowed it,\" went on Miss Dixon, not a whit  daunted. \"Oh, it isn't anything. I've often done the same thing myself  when we've been playing on circuit. It's all right--if you give things  back.\"    \"But I haven't taken anything of yours!\" cried Estelle. \"I never went  into your room!\"    \"Perhaps you have forgotten about it,\" suggested Miss Pennington coldly.  \"You seem to have a headache, and sometimes those headache remedies are  so strong----\"    \"I am tired, but I have no headache,\" said Estelle simply, \"nor have I  taken any strong headache remedies, as you seem to suggest. I haven't  been walking in my sleep, either. And I certainly was not in your room,  Miss Dixon, nor do I know anything about your ring,\" and with that she  turned and entered her room, whence, presently, came the sound of  sobbing.    For a moment Ruth stood still, looking at the two rather flashy  actresses, and wondering if they really meant what they had insinuated.  Then Alice's voice was heard calling:    \"I say, Ruth, are you and Estelle coming? The boys have the auto and  they'll take us in. Come on.\"    Ruth did not answer, and Alice came running up the stairs. She came to a  halt as she saw the trio standing in the hall.    \"Well, for the love of trading stamps! what's it all about?\" she asked.  \"Are you posing for Faith, Hope and Charity?\"    \"Certainly not Charity,\" murmured Ruth.    \"And I certainly have lost what little faith I had, though I hope I do  get my ring back,\" sneered Miss Dixon.    \"Your ring? What's the matter?\" asked Alice. \"Have you lost something?\"    \"My diamond ring was taken off my dresser,\" said the actress.    \"And that Estelle Brown was up here ahead of us, and all alone,\" said  Miss Pennington. \"She may have borrowed it and forgotten to return it.\"    \"That's what one gets for leaving one's valuable diamond rings around  where these extra players are allowed to have free access,\" sneered Miss  Dixon.    \"You mean that little chip diamond ring of yours with the red garnets  around it?\" asked Alice.    \"It isn't a chip diamond at all!\" fired back Miss Dixon. \"It was a  valuable ring.\"    \"Comparatively, perhaps, yes,\" and Alice's voice was coolly sneering,  though she rarely allowed herself this privilege. \"I'm sorry it is  lost----\"    \"Why don't you say taken?\" asked Miss Pennington.    \"Because I don't believe it was,\" snapped Alice. \"Either you forgot  where you laid it or it has dropped behind something. As for thinking  Estelle Brown even borrowed it, that's all nonsense! I don't believe a  word of it.\"    \"Nor I!\" exclaimed Ruth.    \"Did you speak to her about it?\" asked Alice, and then as the sound of  sobbing came from Estelle's room she burst out with:    \"You horrid things! I believe you did! Shame on you!\" and she hurried to  the closed door.    \"It is I--Alice,\" she whispered. \"Let me in. It's all a terrible  mistake. Don't let it affect you so, Estelle dear!\"    Then Alice opened the unlocked door and went in. Ruth paused for a  moment to say:    \"I think you have made a terrible mistake, Miss Dixon,\" and then she  followed her sister to comfort the crying girl.    \"Humph! Mistake!\" sneered Miss Dixon.    \"That's what we get for mixing in with amateurs,\" added her chum. \"Come  on, we'll speak to Mr. Pertell about it.\"    But, for some reason or other, the director was not told directly of the  loss of the ring, nor was Estelle openly accused. She felt as badly,  though, as if she had been, even when Ruth and Alice tried to comfort  her.    Estelle had left the table early, but though she had passed Miss Dixon's  room, she said she had seen no one about.    \"Don't mind about the old ring!\" said Alice. \"It wasn't worth five  dollars.\"    \"But that I should be accused of taking even five dollars!\"    \"You're not!\" said Ruth, quickly. \"They don't dare make an open  accusation. I wouldn't be surprised if Miss Dixon found she had lost her  ring and she's ashamed to acknowledge it.\"    \"Oh, but it is dreadful to be suspected!\" sighed Estelle.    \"You're not--no one in his senses would think of even dreaming you took  so much as a pin!\" cried Alice. \"It's positively silly! I wouldn't make  such a fuss over such a cheap ring.\"    But Miss Dixon did make a \"fuss,\" inasmuch as she talked often about her  loss, though she still made no direct accusation against Estelle. But  Miss Dixon and her chum made life miserable for the daring horsewoman.  They often spoke in her presence of extra players who did not know their  places, and made sneering references to locking up their valuables.    At times Estelle was so miserable that she threatened to leave, but Ruth  and Alice would not hear of it and offered to lay the whole matter  before Mr. Pertell and have him settle it by demanding that the loser of  the ring either make a direct accusation or else keep quiet about her  loss.    Mr. DeVere, who was appealed to by his daughters, voted against this,  however.    \"It is best not to pay any attention to those young ladies,\" he advised.  \"The friends of Estelle know she would not do such a thing, and no one  takes either Miss Dixon or Miss Pennington very seriously--not half as  seriously as they take themselves. It will all blow over.\"    There were big times ahead for the moving picture girls and their  friends. Some of the most important battle scenes were soon to be  filmed, those that had already been taken having been skirmishes.    \"I have succeeded in getting two regiments of the state militia to take  part in a sham battle for our big play,\" said Mr. Pertell one day. \"They  are to come to this part of the country for their annual manoeuvers  under the supervision of the regular army officers, and by paying their  expenses I can have them here for a couple of days.    \"They will come with their horses, tents, and everything, so we shall  have some real war scenes--that is, as real as can be had with blank  cartridges. It will be a great thing for my film.\"    \"And will they work in with our players?\" asked Mr. DeVere.    \"Oh, yes, indeed! I intend to use your daughters in the spy and hospital  scenes, and you as one of the generals. In fact, Mr. DeVere, I depend  on you to coach the militia men. For though they know a lot about  military matters, they do not know how best to pose for the camera. So  I'll be glad if you will act as a sort of stage manager.\"    \"I shall be pleased to,\" answered the old player. And he was greatly  delighted at the opportunity.    About a week after Mr. Pertell had mentioned that two regiments of  militia were coming to Oak Farm, Ruth and Alice awakened one morning to  see the fields about them dotted with tents and soldiers moving about  here and there.    \"Why, it does look just like a real war camp!\" exclaimed Alice, who, in  a very becoming dressing gown, was at the window. \"Oh, isn't it  thrilling! How dare you?\" she exclaimed, drawing hastily back.    \"What was it?\" asked Ruth from her room.    \"One of the officers had the audacity to wave his hand at me.\"    \"You shouldn't have looked out.\"    \"Ha! A pity I can't look out of my own window,\" and to prove that she  was well within her rights Alice looked out again, and pretended not to  see a young man who was standing in the yard below.    There was a bustle of excitement at the breakfast table. All the players  were eager to know what parts they would have, for this was the biggest  thing any of them had yet been in--with two regiments taking the field  one against the other, with many more cannon and guns than Mr. Pertell  had hitherto used.    \"I'll be able to throw on the screen a real battle scene,\" he said.    \"The only trouble,\" declared Pop Snooks, \"is that their uniforms aren't  like those of the days of sixty-three.\" Pop was a stickler for dramatic  correctness.    \"It won't matter,\" said Mr. Pertell. \"The views of the battle will be  distant ones, and no one will be able to see the kind of uniforms the  men wear. Those who are close to the camera will wear the proper Civil  War uniforms we have on hand. The officers of the Guard have agreed to  that.\"    Considerable preparation was necessary before the big film of the battle  could be taken, and to this end it was necessary to have several  conferences among the officers and Mr. Pertell and his camera men and  assistants, including Mr. DeVere. A number of the Guard officers were"]]]
