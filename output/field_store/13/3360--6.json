When an embarkation is to take place, the position and arrangement of  the ships at the docks, the number and regiments of men assigned to  each are arranged, have been arranged, often many days before. The  system and manner are laid down by regulation, from the time the  detachment leaves the post where it has been stationed until the ship  is ready to cast off from the dock and go to sea. Each man takes with  him in the car, from the starting point, his sea kit and immediate  personal equipment, from which he is not permitted to part until it is  handed aboard for stowage in the precise place assigned to it in the  vessel. The muskets, when carried by the men on the journey, are  marked each with a label corresponding to the rack where it is to  stand in the ship. Upon arrival at the port, {p.090} and during the  operation of transferring, a naval officer is in charge so far as  general direction on the dock and on board the ship is concerned, but  without superseding the military ordering and management of the troops  by their own officers. The same general arrangement continues at sea.  That is, the discipline, routine, and supervision of the troops are in  the hands of the military officers, as though in a garrison; but they  can give no orders as to the management or movements of the ship to  the sea captain who commands her. On board, the mode of life is fixed  by regulation--subject, of course, to the changes and interruptions  inseparable from sea conditions. The hours for rising, for meals, for  drills, for bed, and all the usual incidents of the common day are  strictly prescribed.    With such forethought and method, ripened by long experience, results  were obtained differing greatly from the headless scene of confusion  attending the embarkation of our troops at Tampa, as described by  witnesses. Only experience can fully meet the difficulties of a great  operation of this character, and we were {p.091} without experience;  nor can experience like that of British officials ever be expected  among us, for neither we nor any other nation has or will have the  colonial responsibilities of Great Britain. The large number of  seasoned sergeants and corporals, who had embarked and disembarked  half a dozen times before, contributed immeasurably to the order and  rapidity of the process in each shipload that went to make up the  166,000 that left England for South Africa. But while so much falls  naturally to the military element, and can best be discharged by them,  because by their own self-helpfulness alone it can be carried out, the  choice and equipment of ships, the entire preparation and internal  arrangement of them as well as the direction of their movements,  coaling, etc., belong most fitly to the Navy, for the simple reason  that equipment and supervision of this character are merely a special  phase of the general question of naval administration and management;  and no specialty--in whatsoever profession--is so successfully  practised as by a man who has a broad underlying knowledge of, and  wide acquaintance with, {p.092} the profession in its general aspect.  To this unimpeachable generalization the settled practice of the  nation, whose experience in this matter transcends that of all others  combined, gives incontrovertible support.    A brief detail of the methods of the first departure, October 20,  1899, will facilitate comprehension and serve for all others. That day  four transports lay at Southampton Docks, to take on board  Major-General Hildyard, with the first brigade of the first division  of the army to be commanded by Sir Redvers Buller. The trains ran down  to the wharf near the ships, the troops remaining in them until the  usual officers, alighting, had placed the markers to indicate the  positions for each company. At the signal the companies fell in; the  regiments in quarter column. The companies then advanced successively,  forming in line abreast their ship, between two gangways--one forward  and one aft--along each of which was stretched a chain of men, who  thus sent on board, one set the rifles, the other the sea kits and  valises, which, passing from hand to {p.093} hand, reached certainly  and without confusion the spot where their owner knew to seek them.  The company then moved off, clearing the ground for its successor, and  was next divided into messes; which done, each mess, under charge of  its own non-commissioned officer, went on board by a third gangway, to  the living or \"troop\" deck. This unceasing graduated progress  completed its results for the first ship by 2 P.M., when she cast off  her lines and steamed out. The three others were then nearly ready,  but were delayed a short space to receive a visit and inspection from  the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, with a number of the distinguished  higher staff-officers. Thus five thousand troops, who had slept inland  the previous night, were before dark at sea on their way to South  Africa.    The same scene was repeated on the Saturday, Sunday and Monday  following. By the latter evening--October 23--21,672 men had sailed,  the order for mobilisation having been issued just a fortnight before.  Of this number more than half were of the Army Reserve; men, that is,  who had served their {p.094} time, gone into civil life, and now  rejoined the colours.    The specific methods are sufficiently illustrated by the above, but it  may be interesting to note the numbers sent in each succeeding month,  for they show, on the one hand, the continuousness and magnitude of  the operation, viewed as a whole, and also, incidentally, the December  return indicates the slackening of the current, due to the unwarranted  confidence of the people and of the government in the sufficiency of  their preparations, and their underestimate of the difficulties before  them. We in the United States during the Civil War more than once made  a like mistake, discontinuing enlistments and discouraging  volunteering.    In October, from the various ports of the United Kingdom, were  despatched 28,763 officers and men; in November, 29,174; in December,  19,763; in January, 27,854. In the short month of February the spur of  the December disasters began to show its results, for then the figures  rose to 33,591; in March, with which month my information ends, 27,348  went out. The grand total, 166,277, may in its {p.095} effects be  summarized by saying that from October 20 to March 31, 162 days, an  average of over one thousand men sailed daily from Great Britain or  Ireland for the seat of war.    Some illustrations of the capacity of great ocean steamers for such  service may also be interesting. Thus the \"Cymric\" carried a brigade  division of artillery, 18 guns, 36 wagons, 351 officers and men, 430  horses, with all the ammunition and impedimenta, besides a battalion  of infantry; in all nearly 1,600 men. Another, the \"Kildonan Castle,\"  took on an average 2,700 officers and men, on each of three voyages.  The greatest number in any one trip was by the \"Bavarian\"--2,893.    In effect, although embarkation was not wholly confined to the great  shipping ports, the vast majority of the vessels sailed from  Southampton, the Thames, and the Mersey. At each of these was  stationed a captain on the active list of the Navy, representing the  Director of Transports at the Admiralty, and having under him a  numerous staff of sea officers, engineers and clerks, by whom the  work {p.096} of equipment, inspecting, and despatching was  supervised. After sailing, the vigilant eye of the Transport  Department still followed them by further provision of local officials  at foreign and colonial ports, and by the network of submarine  telegraphs which has so singularly modified and centralised the  operations of modern war. At Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, and at  St. Vincent in the Cape de Verde, the intermediate coaling ports, a  ship of war was kept always after October, the captains of which  watched over the transports, cabling arrivals and departures, deciding  questions of coal requirement, repairs, delays, and generally, no  doubt, discharging the function noted by the midshipman, who explained  that he must be going because he saw the first lieutenant's glass was  turned his way.    At Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and Durban were other local  representatives--naval captains with staffs similar to those of the  home ports--so that, to use a phrase of the Director of Transports,  the ships were \"well shepherded.\" It was, in fact, much the position  of a man who with ten fingers manipulates {p.097} the several keys of  a piano. If the end crowns the work it may be said, although the end  is not quite yet, that the work of transportation has been crowned. No  loss of human life by preventable cause has occurred, nor has  complaint been heard of serious hitch of any kind. The numbers speak  for themselves.    The carriage of animals necessary for an army of the numbers  transported would in any case be a weighty and troublesome task, but  it has been rendered doubly so by the scanty resources of the scenes  of war, by the terrible horse-sickness, and by the length of the  voyage, which enfeebles the animals in a proportion ever increasing  with the passage of the days. The evil becomes yet greater from the  pressing needs at the front, and the importunate urgency to hasten the  animals forward, over a railroad journey of hundreds of miles, without  first giving them time to regain the fulness of their strength.    The importance and embarrassing nature of this factor in the campaign  are hard to overestimate."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2099"],[0,"A History of the Moravian Church (#11)"],[1," the penitent  was taken to the Church; and there he told the assembled crowd the story  of his guilty past. Of all the bad men in the country, he said, these  Brethren were the worst. He had even robbed his own father with their  consent and approval. They blasphemed. They took the Communion bread to  their houses, and there hacked it in pieces. They were thieves, and he  himself had committed many a burglary for them. They murdered men and  kidnapped their wives. They had tried to blow up Rockycana in the Thein  Church with gunpowder. They swarmed naked up pillars like Adam and Eve,  and handed each other apples. They prepared poisonous drinks, and  put poisonous smelling powders in their letters. They were skilled in  witchcraft, worshipped Beelzebub, and were wont irreverently to say that  the way to Hell was paved with the bald heads of priests. As this story  was both alarming and lively, the parish priest had it taken down,  sealed and signed by witnesses, copied out, and scattered broadcast  through the land. In vain John Lezek confessed soon after, when brought  by the Brethren before a Magistrate, that his whole story was a vile  invention. If a man tells a falsehood and then denies it, he does not  thereby prevent the falsehood from spreading.    For now a more powerful foe than Lezek made himself felt in the land. Of  all the Popes that ever donned the tiara, Alexander VI. is said to have  presented the most successful image of the devil.[20] He was the father of  the prince of poisoners, Caesar Borgia; he was greedy, immoral, fond  of ease and pleasure; he was even said to be a poisoner himself. If  a well-known man died suddenly in Rome, the common people took it for  granted that the Pope had poisoned his supper. For all that he was pious  enough in a way of his own; and now, in his zeal for the Catholic cause,  he took stern measures against the Church of the Brethren. He had heard  some terrible tales about them. He heard that Peter's pamphlet, \"The  Antichrist,\"[21] was read all over the country. He heard that the number  of the Brethren now was over 100,000. He resolved to crush them to  powder {Papal Bull, Feb. 4th, 1500.}. He sent an agent, the Dominican,  Dr. Henry Institoris, as censor of the press. As soon as Institoris  arrived on the scene, he heard, to his horror, that most of the Brethren  could read; and thereupon he informed the Pope that they had learned  this art from the devil. He revived the stories of Lezek, the popular  feeling was fanned to fury, and wire-pullers worked on the tender heart  of the King.    \"Hunt out and destroy these shameless vagabonds,\" wrote Dr. Augustin  Kaesebrot to King Uladislaus, \"they are not even good enough to be burnt  at the stake. They ought to have their bodies torn by wild beasts and  their blood licked up by dogs.\" For the last five years there had grown  in the land a small sect known as Amosites. They were followers of old  Farmer Amos; they had once belonged to the Brethren; they had broken off  when the scholars had won the day, and now they sent word to the King  to say that the Brethren were planning to defend their cause with the  sword. \"What!\" said the King, \"do they mean to play Ziska? Well, well!  We know how to stop that!\" They were worse than Turks, he declared; they  believed neither in God nor in the Communion; they were a set of lazy  vagabonds. He would soon pay them out for their devilish craft, and  sweep them off the face of the earth. And to this end he summoned the  Diet, and, by the consent of all three Estates, issued the famous Edict  of St. James {July 25th, 1508.}.[22] The decree was sweeping and thorough.  The meetings of the Brethren, public and private, were forbidden. The  books and writings of the Brethren must be burnt. All in Bohemia who  refused to join the Utraquist or Roman Catholic Church were to be  expelled from the country; all nobles harbouring Brethren were to be  fined, and all their priests and teachers were to be imprisoned.    The persecution began. In the village of Kuttenburg lived a brother, by  name Andrew Poliwka. As Kuttenburg was a Romanist village, he fled  for refuge to the Brethren's settlement at Leitomischl. But his wife  betrayed him. He returned to the village, and, desiring to please her,  he attended the parish Church.    The occasion was an installation service. As the sermon ended and the  host was raised, he could hold his tongue no longer. \"Silence, Parson  Jacob,\" he cried to the priest, \"you have babbled enough! Mine hour is  come; I will speak. Dear friends,\" he continued, turning to the people,  \"what are you doing? What are you adoring? An idol made of bread! Oh!  Adore the living God in heaven! He is blessed for evermore!\" The priest  ordered him to hold his peace. He only shrieked the louder. He was  seized, his head was dashed against the pillar, and he was dragged  bleeding to prison. Next day he was tried, and asked to explain why he  had interrupted the service.    \"Who caused Abram,\" he answered, \"to forsake his idolatry and adore  the living God? Who induced Daniel to flee from idols?\" In vain was he  stretched upon the rack. No further answer would he give. He was burnt  to death at the stake. As the flames began to lick his face, he prayed  aloud: \"Jesus, Thou Son of the living God, have mercy upon me, miserable  sinner.\"    At Strakonic dwelt the Brother George Wolinsky, a dependent of Baron  John of Rosenberg {1509.}. The Baron was a mighty man. He was Grand  Prior of the Knights of Malta; he was an orthodox subject of the King,  and he determined that on his estate no villainous Picards[23] should  live. \"See,\" he said one day to George, \"I have made you a servant in  the Church. You must go to Church. You are a Picard, and I have received  instructions from Prague that all men on my estate must be either  Utraquists or Catholics.\"    The Brother refused; the Baron insisted; and the Prior of Strakonic was  brought to convert the heretic. \"No one,\" said the Prior, \"should ever  be tortured into faith. The right method is reasonable instruction,  and innocent blood always cries to Heaven, 'Lord, Lord, when wilt Thou  avenge me.'\"    But this common sense was lost on the furious Baron. As Brother George  refused to yield, the Baron cast him into the deepest dungeon of his  castle. The bread and meat he had secreted in his pockets were removed.  The door of the dungeon was barred, and all that was left for the  comfort of his soul was a heap of straw whereon to die and a comb to do  his hair. For five days he lay in the dark, and then the Baron came to  see him. The prisoner was almost dead. His teeth were closed; his mouth  was rigid; the last spark of life was feebly glimmering. The Baron was  aghast. The mouth was forced open, hot soup was poured in, the prisoner  revived, and the Baron burst into tears.    \"Ah,\" he exclaimed, \"I am glad he is living\"; and allowed George to  return to his Brethren.    Amid scenes like this, Bishop Luke was a tower of strength to his  Brethren. For six years the manses were closed, the Churches empty, the  Pastors homeless, the people scattered; and the Bishop hurried from  glen to glen, held services in the woods and gorges, sent letters to the  parishes he could not visit, and pleaded the cause of his Brethren in  woe in letter after letter to the King. As the storm of persecution  raged, he found time to write a stirring treatise, entitled, \"The  Renewal of the Church,\" and thus by pen and by cheery word he revived  the flagging hope of all.    For a while the Brethren were robbed of this morsel of comfort. As the  Bishop was hastening on a pastoral visit, he was captured by Peter von  Suda, the brigand, \"the prince and master of all thieves,\" was loaded  with chains, cast into a dungeon, and threatened with torture and the  stake. At that moment destruction complete and final seemed to threaten  the Brethren. Never had the billows rolled so high; never had the  breakers roared so loud; and bitterly the hiding Brethren complained  that their leaders had steered them on the rocks.    Yet sunshine gleamed amid the gathering clouds. For some time there had  been spreading among the common people a conviction that the Brethren  were under the special protection of God, and that any man who tried  to harm them would come to a tragic end. It was just while the Brethren  were sunk in despair that several of their enemies suddenly died,  and people said that God Himself had struck a blow for the persecuted  \"Pitmen.\" The great Dr. Augustin, their fiercest foe, fell dead from his  chair at dinner. Baron Colditz, the Chancellor, fell ill of a carbuncle  in his foot, and died. Baron Henry von Neuhaus, who had boasted to the  King how many Brethren he had starved to death, went driving in his  sleigh, was upset, and was skewered on his own hunting knife. Baron Puta  von Swihow was found dead in his cellar. Bishop John of Grosswardein  fell from his carriage, was caught on a sharp nail, had his bowels torn  out, and miserably perished. And the people, struck with awe, exclaimed:  \"Let him that is tired of life persecute the Brethren, for he is sure  not to live another year.\"    Thus the Brethren possessed their souls in patience till the persecution  ended. The King of Bohemia, Uladislaus II., died {March 13th, 1516.}.  His successor was only a boy. The Utraquists and Catholics began to  quarrel with each other. The robber, von Suda, set Luke at liberty. The  great Bishop became chief Elder of the Church. The whole land was soon  in a state of disorder. The barons and knights were fighting each other,  and, in the general stress and storm, the quiet Brethren were almost  forgotten and allowed to live in peace.    And just at this juncture came news from afar that seemed to the  Brethren like glad tidings from Heaven {1517.}. No longer were the  Brethren to be alone, no longer to be a solitary voice crying in the  wilderness. As the"]]]
