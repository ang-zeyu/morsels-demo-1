He says: \"Above everything we need melody--melody and  rhythm. Rhythm is the great thing. We have it in Nature. The trees  sway, and our steps keep time, and our very souls respond.\" In  Wagner's \"Meistersinger,\" which he calls \"a symphonic poem with  action,\" Nevin finds his musical creed and his model.    And now, if authority is needed for all this frankly enthusiastic  admiration, let it be found in and echoed from Karl Klindworth, who  said of Nevin: \"His talent is _ungeheures_ [one of the strongest  adjectives in the German language]. If he works hard and is  conscientious, he can say for the musical world something that no one  else can say.\"      _John Philip Sousa._    [Illustration: Autograph of John Philip Sousa]    [Illustration: JOHN PHILIP SOUSA.]    In common with most of those that pretend to love serious music, a  certain person was for long guilty of the pitiful snobbery of rating  march-tunes as the lowest form of the art. But one day he joined a  National Guard regiment, and his first long march was that  heart-breaking dress-parade of about fifteen miles through the wind  and dust of the day Grant's monument was dedicated. Most of the music  played by the band was merely rhythmical embroidery, chiefly in bugle  figures, as helpful as a Clementi sonatina; but now and then there  would break forth a magic elixir of tune that fairly plucked his feet  up for him, put marrow in unwilling bones, and replaced the dreary  doggedness of the heart with a great zest for progress, a stout  martial fire, and a fierce _esprit de corps_; with patriotism indeed.  In almost every case, that march belonged to one John Philip Sousa.    It came upon this wretch then, that, if it is a worthy ambition in a  composer to give voice to passionate love-ditties, or vague  contemplation, or the deep despair of a funeral cortege, it is also a  very great thing to instil courage, and furnish an inspiration that  will send men gladly, proudly, and gloriously through hardships into  battle and death. This last has been the office of the march-tune, and  it is as susceptible of structural logic or embellishments as the  fugue, rondo, or what not. These architectural qualities Sousa's  marches have in high degree, as any one will find that examines their  scores or listens analytically. They have the further merit of  distinct individuality, and the supreme merit of founding a school.    It is only the plain truth to say that Sousa's marches have founded a  school; that he has indeed revolutionized march-music. His career  resembles that of Johann Strauss in many ways. A certain body of old  fogies has always presumed to deride the rapturous waltzes of  Strauss, though they have won enthusiastic praise from even the  esoteric Brahms, and gained from Wagner such words as these: \"One  Strauss waltz overshadows, in respect to animation, finesse, and real  musical worth, most of the mechanical, borrowed, factory-made products  of the present time.\" The same words might be applied to Sousa's  marches with equal justice. They have served also for dance music, and  the two-step, borne into vogue by Sousa's music, has driven the waltz  almost into desuetude.    There is probably no composer in the world with a popularity equal to  that of Sousa. Though he sold his \"Washington Post\" march outright for  $35, his \"Liberty Bell\" march is said to have brought him $35,000. It  is found that his music has been sold to eighteen thousand bands in  the United States alone. The amazing thing is to learn that there are  so many bands in the country. Sousa's marches have appeared on  programs in all parts of the civilized world. At the Queen's Jubilee,  when the Queen stepped forward to begin the grand review of the  troops, the combined bands of the household brigade struck up the  \"Washington Post.\" On other important occasions it appeared constantly  as the chief march of the week. General Miles heard the marches played  in Turkey by the military bands in the reviews.    The reason for this overwhelming appeal to the hearts of a planet is  not far to seek. The music is conceived in a spirit of high martial  zest. It is proud and gay and fierce, thrilled and thrilling with  triumph. Like all great music it is made up of simple elements, woven  together by a strong personality. It is not difficult now to write  something that sounds more or less like a Sousa march, any more than  it is difficult to write parodies, serious or otherwise, on Beethoven,  Mozart, or Chopin. The glory of Sousa is that he was the first to  write in this style; that he has made himself a style; that he has so  stirred the musical world that countless imitations have sprung up  after him.    The individuality of the Sousa march is this, that, unlike most of the  other influential marches, it is not so much a musical exhortation  from without, as a distillation of the essences of soldiering from  within. Sousa's marches are not based upon music-room enthusiasms, but  on his own wide experiences of the feelings of men who march together  in the open field.    And so his band music expresses all the nuances of the military  psychology: the exhilaration of the long unisonal stride, the grip on  the musket, the pride in the regimentals and the regiment,--_esprit de  corps_. He expresses the inevitable foppery of the severest soldier,  the tease and the taunt of the evolutions, the fierce wish that all  this ploying and deploying were in the face of an actual enemy, the  mania to reek upon a tangible foe all the joyous energy, the  blood-thirst of the warrior.    These things Sousa embodies in his music as no other music writer ever  has. To approach Sousa's work in the right mood, the music critic must  leave his stuffy concert hall and his sober black; he must flee from  the press, don a uniform, and march. After his legs and spirits have  grown aweary under the metronomic tunes of others, let him note the  surge of blood in his heart and the rejuvenation of all his muscles  when the brasses flare into a barbaric Sousa march. No man that  marches can ever feel anything but gratitude and homage for Sousa.    Of course he is a trickster at times; admitted that he stoops to  conquer at times, yet in his field he is supreme. He is worthy of  serious consideration, because his thematic material is almost always  novel and forceful, and his instrumentation full of contrast and  climax. He is not to be judged by the piano versions of his works,  because they are abominably thin and inadequate, and they are not  _klaviermaessig_. There should be a Liszt or a Taussig to transcribe  him.    When all's said and done, Sousa is the pulse of the nation, and in  war of more inspiration and power to our armies than ten colonels with  ten braw regiments behind them.    Like Strauss', Mr. Sousa's father was a musician who forbade his son  to devote himself to dance music. As Strauss' mother enabled him  secretly to work out his own salvation, so did Sousa's mother help  him. Sousa's father was a political exile from Spain, and earned a  precarious livelihood by playing a trombone in the very band at  Washington which later became his son's stepping-stone to fame. Sousa  was born at Washington in 1859. His mother is German, and Sousa's  music shows the effect of Spanish yeast in sturdy German rye bread.  Sousa's teachers were John Esputa and George Felix Benkert. The latter  Mr. Sousa considers one of the most complete musicians this country  has ever known. He put him through such a thorough theoretical  training, that at fifteen Sousa was teaching harmony. At eight he had  begun to earn his own living as a violin player at a dancing-school,  and at ten he was a public soloist. At sixteen he was the conductor of  an orchestra in a variety theatre. Two years later he was musical  director of a travelling company in Mr. Milton Nobles' well-known  play, \"The Phoenix,\" for which he composed the incidental music.  Among other incidents in a career of growing importance was a position  in the orchestra with which Offenbach toured this country. At the age  of twenty-six, after having played, with face blacked, as a negro  minstrel, after travelling with the late Matt Morgan's Living Picture  Company, and working his way through and above other such experiences  in the struggle for life, Sousa became the leader of the United States  Marine Band. In the twelve years of his leadership he developed this  unimportant organization into one of the best military bands in the  world.    In 1892 his leadership had given him such fame that he withdrew from  the government service to take the leadership of the band carrying his  own name.    A work of enormous industry was his collection and arrangement, by  governmental order, of the national and typical tunes of all nations  into one volume, an invaluable book of reference.    Out of the more than two hundred published compositions by Sousa, it  is not possible to mention many here. Though some of the names are not  happily chosen, they call up many episodes of parade gaiety and  jauntiness, or warlike fire. The \"Liberty Bell,\" \"Directorate,\" \"High  School Cadets,\" \"King Cotton,\" \"Manhattan Beach,\" \"'Sound Off!'\"  \"Washington Post,\" \"Picador,\" and others, are all stirring works; his  best, I think, is a deeply patriotic march, \"The Stars and Stripes  Forever.\" The second part of this has some brass work of particular  originality and vim.    In manuscript are a few works of larger form: a symphonic poem, \"The  Chariot Race,\" an historical scene, \"Sheridan's Ride,\" and two suites,  \"Three Quotations\" and \"The Last Days of Pompeii.\"    The \"Three Quotations\" are:        (_a_) \"The King of France, with twenty thousand men,            Marched up a hill and then marched down again,\"    which is the motive for a delightful scherzo-march of much"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23860"],[0,"The Young Man's Guide (#11)"],[1,"need to be set off by expensive clothes.  Female eyes are, in such cases, discerning; they can discover beauty  though surrounded by rags: and, take this as a secret worth half a  fortune to you, that women, however vain they may be themselves,  _despise vanity in men_.      SECTION XII. _Bashfulness and Modesty._    Dr. Young says, 'The man that blushes is not quite a brute.' This is  undoubtedly true; yet nothing is more clear, as Addison has shown us,  than that a person may be both bashful and impudent.    I know the world commend the former quality, and condemn the latter;  but I deem them both evils. Perhaps the latter is the greater of the  two. The proper medium is true modesty. This is always commendable.    We are compelled to take the world, in a great measure, as it is. We  can hardly expect men to come and buy our wares, unless we advertise or  expose them for sale. So if we would commend ourselves to the notice of  our fellow men, we must set ourselves up,--not for something which we  are not;--but for what, upon a careful examination, we find reason to  think we are. Many a good and valuable man has gone through _this_  life, without being properly estimated; from the vain belief that true  merit could not always escape unnoticed. This belief, after all, is  little else but a species of fatalism.    By setting ourselves up, I do not mean puffing and pretending, or  putting on airs of haughtiness or arrogance; or any affectation  whatever. But there are those--and some of them are persons of good  sense, in many respects, who can scarcely answer properly, when  addressed, or look the person with whom they are conversing in the  face; and who often render themselves ridiculous _for fear they shall  be so_. I have seen a man of respectable talents, who, in conversation  never raised his eyes higher than the tassels of his friend's boots;  and another who could never converse without turning half or three  quarters round, so as to present his shoulder or the backside of his  head, instead of a plain, honest face.    I have known young men _injured_ by bashfulness. It is vain to say that  it should not be so. The world is not what it should be, in many  respects; _and I must insist_ that it is our duty, to take it as it is,  in order to make it better, or even in order to live in it with  comfort. He that _thinks_ he _shall_ not, most surely _will_ not,  please. A man of sense, and knowledge of the world, will assert his own  rights, and pursue his own purposes as steadily and uninterruptedly as  the most impudent man living; but then there is at the same time an air  of modesty in all he does; while an overbearing or impudent _manner_ of  doing the same things, would undoubtedly have given offence. Hence a  certain wise man has said; 'He who knows the world will not be too  bashful; and he who knows himself will never be impudent.'    Perpetual embarrassment in company or in conversation, is sometimes  even construed into meanness. Avoid,--if you can do it, without too  great a sacrifice--every appearance of deserving a charge so weighty.      SECTION XIII. _Politeness and Good-Breeding._    Awkwardness is scarcely more tolerable than bashfulness. It must  proceed from one of two things; either from not having kept good  company, or from not having derived any benefit from it. Many very  worthy people have certain odd tricks, and ill habits, that excite a  prejudice against them, which it is not easy to overcome. Hence the  importance of _good-breeding_.    Now there are not a few who despise all these _little things_ of life,  as they call them; and yet much of their lives is taken up with them,  small as they are. And since these self same little things cannot be  dispensed with, is it not better that they should be done in the  easiest, and at the same time the pleasantest manner possible?    There is no habit more difficult to attain, and few so necessary to  possess, as perfect good-breeding. It is equally inconsistent with a  stiff formality, an impertinent forwardness, and an awkward  bashfulness. True Christian education would seem to include it; and yet  unfortunately, Christians are not always polite.    Is it not surprising that we may sometimes observe, in mere men of the  world, that kind of carriage which should naturally be expected from an  individual thoroughly imbued with the spirit of Christianity, while his  very neighbors, who are professing Christians, appear, by their  conduct, to be destitute of such a spirit? Which, then, in practice (I  mean so far as this fact is concerned) are the best Christians? But I  know what will be the answer; and I know that these things ought not so  to be.    No good reason can be given why a Christian should not be as well-bred  as his neighbor. It is difficult to conceive how a person can follow  the rules given in the Sermon on the Mount, without being, and showing  himself to be, well-bred. I have even known men who were no friends to  the bible, to declare it as their unequivocal belief that he whose life  should conform to the principles of that sermon, could not avoid being  _truly polite_.    There are not a few who _confound_ good-breeding with affectation, just  as they confound a reasonable attention to dress with foppery. This  calling things by wrong names is very common, how much soever it may be  lamented.    _Good-breeding_, or true politeness, is the art of showing men, by  external signs, the internal regard we have for them. It arises from  good sense, improved by good company. Good-breeding is never to be  learned, though it may be _improved_, by the study of books; and  therefore they who attempt it, appear stiff and pedantic. The really  well-bred, as they become so by use and observation, are not liable to  affectation. You see good-breeding in all they do, without seeing the  art of it. Like other habits, it is acquired by practice.    An engaging manner and genteel address may be out of our power,  although it is a misfortune that it should be so. But it is in the  power of every body to be kind, condescending, and affable. It is in  the power of every person who has any thing to say to a fellow being,  to say it with kind feelings, and with a sincere desire to please; and  this, whenever it is done, will atone for much awkwardness in the  manner of expression. Forced complaisance is foppery; and affected  easiness is ridiculous.    Good-breeding is, and ought to be, an amiable and persuasive thing; it  beautifies the actions and even the looks of men. But the _grimace_ of  good-breeding is not less _odious_.    In short, good-breeding is a forgetting of ourselves so far as to seek  what may be agreeable to others, but in so artless and delicate a  manner as will scarcely allow them to _perceive_ that we are so  employed; and the regarding of ourselves, not as the centre of motion  on which every thing else is to revolve, but only as one of the wheels  or parts, in a vast machine, embracing other wheels and parts of equal,  and perhaps more than equal importance. It is hence utterly opposed to  selfishness, vanity, or pride. Nor is it proportioned to the supposed  riches and rank of him whose favor and patronage you would gladly  cultivate; but extends to all. It knows how to contradict with respect;  and to please, without adulation.    The following are a few plain directions for attaining the character of  a well-bred man.    1. Never weary your company by talking too long, or too frequently.    2. Always look people in the face when you address them, and generally  when they are speaking to you.    3. Attend to a person who is addressing you. Inattention marks a  trifling mind, and is a most unpardonable piece of rudeness. It is even  an _affront_; for it is the same thing as saying that his remarks are  not _worth_ your attention.    4. Do not interrupt the person who is speaking by saying _yes_, or  _no_, or _hem_, at every sentence; it is the most useless thing that  can be. An occasional assent, either by word or action, may be well  enough; but even a nod of assent is sometimes repeated till it becomes  disgusting.    5. Remember that every person in a company likes to be the _hero_ of  that company. Never, therefore, engross the whole conversation to  yourself.    6. Learn to sit or stand still, while another is speaking to you. You  will not of course be so rude as to dig in the earth with your feet, or  take your penknife from your pocket and pair your nails; but there are  a great many other little movements which are scarcely less clownish.    7. Never anticipate for another, or _help him out_, as it is called.  This is quite a rude affair, and should ever be avoided. Let him  conclude his story for himself. It is time enough for you to make  corrections or additions afterward, if you deem his account defective.  It is also a piece of impoliteness to interrupt another in his remarks.    8. Say as little of _yourself_ and _your friends_ as possible.    9. Make it a rule never to accuse, without due consideration, any body  or association of men.    10. Never try to appear more wise or learned than the rest of the  company. Not that you should _affect_ ignorance; but endeavor to remain  within your own proper sphere.      SECTION XIV. _Personal Habits._    I have elsewhere spoken of the importance of early rising. Let me  merely request you, in this place, to form a _habit_ of this kind, from  which no ordinary circumstances shall suffer you to depart. Your first  object after rising and devotion, should be to take a survey of the  business which lies before you during the day, making of course a  suitable allowance for exigencies. I have seldom known a man in  business thrive--and men of business we all ought to be, whatever may  be our occupation--who did not rise early in the morning, and plan his  work for the day. Some of those who have been most successful, made it  a point to have this done"]]]
