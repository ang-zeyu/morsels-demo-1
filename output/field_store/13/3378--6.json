To the Jew of that period, moreover, abode in caverns was a familiar  idea, made so by every-day occurrences, and by what he heard of  Sabbaths in the synagogues. How much of Jewish history, how many  of the many exciting incidents in that history, had transpired in  caves! Yet further, these people were Jews of Bethlehem, with whom  the idea was especially commonplace; for their locality abounded  with caves great and small, some of which had been dwelling-places  from the time of the Emim and Horites. No more was there offence  to them in the fact that the cavern to which they were being taken  had been, or was, a stable. They were the descendants of a race of  herdsmen, whose flocks habitually shared both their habitations and  wanderings. In keeping with a custom derived from Abraham, the tent  of the Bedawin yet shelters his horses and children alike. So they  obeyed the keeper cheerfully, and gazed at the house, feeling only  a natural curiosity. Everything associated with the history of David  was interesting to them.    The building was low and narrow, projecting but a little from  the rock to which it was joined at the rear, and wholly without  a window. In its blank front there was a door, swung on enormous  hinges, and thickly daubed with ochreous clay. While the wooden  bolt of the lock was being pushed back, the women were assisted  from their pillions.  Upon the opening of the door, the keeper  called out,    \"Come in!\"    The guests entered, and stared about them. It became apparent  immediately that the house was but a mask or covering for the  mouth of a natural cave or grotto, probably forty feet long,  nine or ten high, and twelve or fifteen in width. The light  streamed through the doorway, over an uneven floor, falling  upon piles of grain and fodder, and earthenware and household  property, occupying the centre of the chamber. Along the sides  were mangers, low enough for sheep, and built of stones laid in  cement. There were no stalls or partitions of any kind. Dust and  chaff yellowed the floor, filled all the crevices and hollows,  and thickened the spider-webs, which dropped from the ceiling  like bits of dirty linen; otherwise the place was cleanly, and,  to appearance, as comfortable as any of the arched lewens of the  khan proper. In fact, a cave was the model and first suggestion  of the lewen.    \"Come in!\" said the guide. \"These piles upon the floor are  for travellers like yourselves. Take what of them you need.\"    Then he spoke to Mary.    \"Can you rest here?\"    \"The place is sanctified,\" she answered.    \"I leave you then. Peace be with you all!\"    When he was gone, they busied themselves making the cave habitable.          CHAPTER X.      At a certain hour in the evening the shouting and stir of the  people in and about the khan ceased; at the same time, every  Israelite, if not already upon his feet, arose, solemnized his  face, looked towards Jerusalem, crossed his hands upon his breast,  and prayed; for it was the sacred ninth hour, when sacrifices were  offered in the temple on Moriah, and God was supposed to be there.  When the hands of the worshippers fell down, the commotion broke  forth again; everybody hastened to bread, or to make his pallet.  A little later, the lights were put out, and there was silence,  and then sleep.    * * * * * *    About midnight some one on the roof cried out, \"What light is that  in the sky? Awake, brethren, awake and see!\"    The people, half asleep, sat up and looked; then they became  wide-awake, though wonder-struck. And the stir spread to the  court below, and into the lewens; soon the entire tenantry of  the house and court and enclosure were out gazing at the sky.    And this was what they saw. A ray of light, beginning at a height  immeasurably beyond the nearest stars, and dropping obliquely  to the earth; at its top, a diminishing point; at its base,  many furlongs in width; its sides blending softly with the  darkness of the night, its core a roseate electrical splendor.  The apparition seemed to rest on the nearest mountain southeast  of the town, making a pale corona along the line of the summit.  The khan was touched luminously, so that those upon the roof saw  each other's faces, all filled with wonder.    Steadily, through minutes, the ray lingered, and then the wonder  changed to awe and fear; the timid trembled; the boldest spoke  in whispers.    \"Saw you ever the like?\" asked one.    \"It seems just over the mountain there. I cannot tell what it is,  nor did I ever see anything like it,\" was the answer.    \"Can it be that a star has burst and fallen?\" asked another,  his tongue faltering.    \"When a star falls, its light goes out.\"    \"I have it!\" cried one, confidently. \"The shepherds have seen a  lion, and made fires to keep him from the flocks.\"    The men next the speaker drew a breath of relief, and said, \"Yes,  that is it! The flocks were grazing in the valley over there to-day.\"    A bystander dispelled the comfort.    \"No, no! Though all the wood in all the valleys of Judah was brought  together in one pile and fired, the blaze would not throw a light so  strong and high.\"    After that there was silence on the house-top, broken but once  again while the mystery continued.    \"Brethren!\" exclaimed a Jew of venerable mien, \"what we see is the  ladder our father Jacob saw in his dream. Blessed be the Lord God  of our fathers!\"          CHAPTER XI      A mile and a half, it may be two miles, southeast of Bethlehem,  there is a plain separated from the town by an intervening swell  of the mountain. Besides being well sheltered from the north winds,  the vale was covered with a growth of sycamore, dwarf-oak, and pine  trees, while in the glens and ravines adjoining there were thickets  of olive and mulberry; all at this season of the year invaluable  for the support of sheep, goats, and cattle, of which the wandering  flocks consisted.    At the side farthest from the town, close under a bluff, there was  an extensive marah, or sheepcot, ages old. In some long-forgotten  foray, the building had been unroofed and almost demolished.  The enclosure attached to it remained intact, however, and that  was of more importance to the shepherds who drove their charges  thither than the house itself. The stone wall around the lot was  high as a man's head, yet not so high but that sometimes a panther  or a lion, hungering from the wilderness, leaped boldly in. On the  inner side of the wall, and as an additional security against  the constant danger, a hedge of the rhamnus had been planted,  an invention so successful that now a sparrow could hardly  penetrate the overtopping branches, armed as they were with  great clusters of thorns hard as spikes.    The day of the occurrences which occupy the preceding chapters,  a number of shepherds, seeking fresh walks for their flocks, led  them up to this plain; and from early morning the groves had been  made ring with calls, and the blows of axes, the bleating of sheep  and goats, the tinkling of bells, the lowing of cattle, and the  barking of dogs. When the sun went down, they led the way to the  marah, and by nightfall had everything safe in the field; then they  kindled a fire down by the gate, partook of their humble supper,  and sat down to rest and talk, leaving one on watch.    There were six of these men, omitting the watchman; and afterwhile  they assembled in a group near the fire, some sitting, some lying  prone. As they went bareheaded habitually, their hair stood out in  thick, coarse, sunburnt shocks; their beard covered their throats,  and fell in mats down the breast; mantles of the skin of kids  and lambs, with the fleece on, wrapped them from neck to knee,  leaving the arms exposed; broad belts girthed the rude garments  to their waists; their sandals were of the coarsest quality;  from their right shoulders hung scrips containing food and  selected stones for slings, with which they were armed; on the  ground near each one lay his crook, a symbol of his calling and  a weapon of offence.    Such were the shepherds of Judea! In appearance, rough and savage  as the gaunt dogs sitting with them around the blaze; in fact,  simple-minded, tender-hearted; effects due, in part, to the  primitive life they led, but chiefly to their constant care  of things lovable and helpless.    They rested and talked, and their talk was all about their flocks,  a dull theme to the world, yet a theme which was all the world to  them. If in narrative they dwelt long upon affairs of trifling  moment; if one of them omitted nothing of detail in recounting  the loss of a lamb, the relation between him and the unfortunate  should be remembered: at birth it became his charge, his to keep  all its days, to help over the floods, to carry down the hollows,  to name and train; it was to be his companion, his object of thought  and interest, the subject of his will; it was to enliven and share  his wanderings; in its defense he might be called on to face the  lion or robber--to die.    The great events, such as blotted out nations and changed the  mastery of the world, were trifles to them, if perchance they came  to their knowledge. Of what Herod was doing in this city or that,  building palaces and gymnasia, and indulging forbidden practises,  they occasionally heard. As was her habit in those days, Rome did  not wait for people slow to inquire about her; she came to them.  Over the hills along which he was leading his lagging herd, or in  the fastnesses in which he was hiding them, not unfrequently the  shepherd was startled by the blare of trumpets, and, peering out,  beheld a cohort, sometimes a legion, in march; and when the  glittering crests were gone, and the excitement incident to  the intrusion over, he bent himself to evolve the meaning of  the eagles and gilded globes of the soldiery, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215"],[0,"The Call of the Wild (#11)"],[1,"the morning to break that camp and get  the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they  were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load. Some days they did  not make ten miles. On other days they were unable to get started  at all. And on no day did they succeed in making more than half the  distance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation.    It was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. But they  hastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when underfeeding  would commence. The Outside dogs, whose digestions had not been trained  by chronic famine to make the most of little, had voracious appetites.  And when, in addition to this, the worn-out huskies pulled weakly, Hal  decided that the orthodox ration was too small. He doubled it. And to  cap it all, when Mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver  in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more, she  stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. But it was not food that  Buck and the huskies needed, but rest. And though they were making poor  time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.    Then came the underfeeding. Hal awoke one day to the fact that his  dog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further,  that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. So  he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day's  travel. His sister and brother-in-law seconded him; but they were  frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence. It was a  simple matter to give the dogs less food; but it was impossible to  make the dogs travel faster, while their own inability to get under way  earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours. Not  only did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to  work themselves.    The first to go was Dub. Poor blundering thief that he was, always  getting caught and punished, he had none the less been a faithful  worker. His wrenched shoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from  bad to worse, till finally Hal shot him with the big Colt's revolver. It  is a saying of the country that an Outside dog starves to death on the  ration of the husky, so the six Outside dogs under Buck could do no less  than die on half the ration of the husky. The Newfoundland went first,  followed by the three short-haired pointers, the two mongrels hanging  more grittily on to life, but going in the end.    By this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had  fallen away from the three people. Shorn of its glamour and romance,  Arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and  womanhood. Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied  with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and  brother. To quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do.  Their irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it, doubled  upon it, outdistanced it. The wonderful patience of the trail which  comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of speech  and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. They had no  inkling of such a patience. They were stiff and in pain; their muscles  ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because of this  they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their lips in  the morning and last at night.    Charles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance. It was  the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the  work, and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity.  Sometimes Mercedes sided with her husband, sometimes with her brother.  The result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel. Starting from  a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire (a dispute  which concerned only Charles and Hal), presently would be lugged in the  rest of the family, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people thousands  of miles away, and some of them dead. That Hal's views on art, or the  sort of society plays his mother's brother wrote, should have  anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood, passes  comprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that  direction as in the direction of Charles's political prejudices. And  that Charles's sister's tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the  building of a Yukon fire, was apparent only to Mercedes, who disburdened  herself of copious opinions upon that topic, and incidentally upon a  few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her husband's family. In the  meantime the fire remained unbuilt, the camp half pitched, and the dogs  unfed.    Mercedes nursed a special grievance--the grievance of sex. She was  pretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. But  the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save  chivalrous. It was her custom to be helpless. They complained. Upon  which impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex-prerogative,  she made their lives unendurable. She no longer considered the dogs, and  because she was sore and tired, she persisted in riding on the sled. She  was pretty and soft, but she weighed one hundred and twenty pounds--a  lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals.  She rode for days, till they fell in the traces and the sled stood  still. Charles and Hal begged her to get off and walk, pleaded with her,  entreated, the while she wept and importuned Heaven with a recital of  their brutality.    On one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength. They never  did it again. She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child, and sat  down on the trail. They went on their way, but she did not move. After  they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for  her, and by main strength put her on the sled again.    In the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of  their animals. Hal's theory, which he practised on others, was that one  must get hardened. He had started out preaching it to his sister and  brother-in-law. Failing there, he hammered it into the dogs with a club.  At the Five Fingers the dog-food gave out, and a toothless old squaw  offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the Colt's  revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at Hal's hip. A poor  substitute for food was this hide, just as it had been stripped from the  starved horses of the cattlemen six months back. In its frozen state it  was more like strips of galvanized iron, and when a dog wrestled it into  his stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious leathery strings and  into a mass of short hair, irritating and indigestible.    And through it all Buck staggered along at the head of the team as in  a nightmare. He pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull, he  fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him  to his feet again. All the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his  beautiful furry coat. The hair hung down, limp and draggled, or matted  with dried blood where Hal's club had bruised him. His muscles had  wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so  that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly  through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness. It was  heartbreaking, only Buck's heart was unbreakable. The man in the red  sweater had proved that.    As it was with Buck, so was it with his mates. They were perambulating  skeletons. There were seven all together, including him. In their very  great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the  bruise of the club. The pain of the beating was dull and distant,  just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and  distant. They were not half living, or quarter living. They were simply  so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly. When a  halt was made, they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs, and the  spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out. And when the club or whip  fell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they tottered to  their feet and staggered on.    There came a day when Billee, the good-natured, fell and could not rise.  Hal had traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked Billee  on the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of the  harness and dragged it to one side. Buck saw, and his mates saw, and  they knew that this thing was very close to them. On the next day Koona  went, and but five of them remained: Joe, too far gone to be malignant;  Pike, crippled and limping, only half conscious and not conscious enough  longer to malinger; Sol-leks, the one-eyed, still faithful to the toil  of trace and trail, and mournful in that he had so little strength with  which to pull; Teek, who had not travelled so far that winter and who  was now beaten more than the others because he was fresher; and Buck,  still at the head of the team, but no longer enforcing discipline or  striving to enforce it, blind with weakness half the time and keeping  the trail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet.    It was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware  of it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by three  in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The whole long  day was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had given way  to the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur arose from all  the land, fraught with the joy of living. It came from the things that  lived and moved again, things which had been as dead and which had not  moved during the long months of frost. The sap was rising in the pines.  The willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds. Shrubs and vines  were putting on fresh garbs of"]]]
