This son  contracted serious illness in Ireland, and died 'after a tedious  languishing sickness' early in 1699, aged 44 years, leaving one son,  then a student at Oxford.    Some time before this his elder brother, George, having lost his last  son and heir, had settled the Wotton estate upon John Evelyn. In May  1694, yielding to the request to make Wotton his home, he went to  Wotton, leaving Sayes Court in charge of his daughter Susanna and her  husband William Draper, whose marriage had been celebrated about a year  previously. In 1696 it was let for three years to Admiral Benbow, who  sublet it in 1698 to Peter the Great, then visiting the Deptford  Dockyards for three months as his Majesty's guest. So great was the  destruction done to the gardens, trees, and holly-hedges, that Wren was  asked to report on the compensation suitable, and L162-7-0 were paid to  Evelyn for damage to the house and garden.    Early in 1695 Evelyn accepted the offer of the Treasurership of  Greenwich Hospital, then about to be rebuilt and endowed for the  maintainence of decayed seamen, which was made to him by Lord Godolphin,  who had been the husband of his former friend Miss Blagg. During the  days of Charles II. some such transformation of the Palace had been  under consideration, but it was the 30th June 1696 before Evelyn and Sir  Christopher Wren 'laid the first stone of the intended foundation,  precisely at 5 o'clock in the evening, after we had din'd together.'  This appointment carried with it 'the salary of L200 per ann. of which I  have never yet receiv'd one penny of the tallies assign'd for it, now  two years at Lady-day; my son-in-law Draper is my substitute.' When the  new Commission for Greenwich Hospital was sealed in August 1703 Evelyn  resigned his office of Treasurer in favour of Draper.    His brother George dying in October 1699, Evelyn then became the owner  of Wotton, and looked to his grandson, the Oxford Student, to 'be the  support of the Wotton family.' The lad had a bad attack of small-pox in  the autumn of 1700, a malady that had caused many gaps in the family  circle; but, coming safely through this illness, he was in July 1701, by  the patronage of Lord Godolphin, made one of the Commissioners of the  Prizes, with a salary of L500 a year, while he was still an  undergraduate at Oxford. And in January 1704 the same noble patron  appointed him Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a  year. He afterwards married Ann, daughter of Hugh Boscawen (afterwards  Lord Falmouth), Lord Godolphin's niece, and was created a baronet in  1713. It was through him that the present family of Evelyn of Wotton  directly descend, though the baronetcy lapsed on the death of his  grandson Frederick in 1812.    As he had done twenty years before, so also on now attaining his 80th  birthday on 31st. October 1700 Evelyn rendered thanks for mercies with  his characteristic religious feeling. 'I with my soul render thanks to  God, who of his infinite mercy, not only brought me out of many  troubles, but this yeare restor'd me to health, after an ague and other  infirmities of so greate an age, my sight, hearing and other senses and  faculties tolerable, which I implore him to continue, with the pardon of  my sins past, and grace to acknowledge by my improvement of his  goodnesse the ensuing yeare, if it be his pleasure to protract my life,  that I may be the better prepar'd for my last day, through the infinite  merits of my blessed Saviour, the Lord Jesus, Amen.'    Five times more was he to be privileged to record his thanks and prayers  on successive returns of this anniversary. One of the very last entries  in his memoirs is that on 31st. October 1705 'I am this day arriv'd to  the 85th year of my age. Lord teach me so to number my days to come that  I may apply them to wisdom'. And numbered, indeed, they then were; for  on the 27th of February 1706 he passed quietly and peacefully away,  retaining his faculties to the last. And he was laid at rest in the  Chancel of Wotton Church.    During the course of his long and distinguished life he had seen many  stirring events, had taken part in many important affairs, had achieved  much, and had suffered much. He had outlived four reigns, two of which  were terminated by a natural death, one by public execution, and one by  abdication. He had served many public and other distinguished offices  with zeal, ability, integrity, and success. He had given to English  literature some of the classic works that are among the treasures of our  literature of the Restoration period. He had outlived all of his six  sons, most of whom had died in childhood, as well as his eldest and  favourite daughter. Of all his nine children, the sole survivors were  his daughter Elizabeth, who was soon afterwards married to a son of Sir  John Tippet, and Susanna, wife of William Draper, afterwards of Adscomb  near Croydon. After nearly 60 years of pure domestic wedded life, in  marked contrast to the prevailing dissoluteness of the time, Evelyn was  survived for nearly three years by his widow, who died in 1709, aged 74  years, cherishing to the last her love and affection for him to whom her  destiny had been committed whilst she was still a mere child. 'His care  of my education', she wrote in her last Will and Testament, 'was such as  might become a father, a lover, a friend, and a husband; for  instruction, tenderness, affection and fidelity to the last moment of  his life; which obligation I mention with a gratitude to his memory ever  dear to me; and I must not omit to own the sense I have of my parents'  care and goodness in placing me in such worthy hands.' Surely no husband  ever had a nobler epitaph.    In an age of fierce political and ecclesiastical conflict, Evelyn,  often, no doubt, strongly tempted to partisanship, managed to steer his  course with prudence and great worldly judgment. But for that, his  industry and business talent would probably have brought him more  prominently into office under Charles II. In a corrupt and profligate  age, however, his character stands out as that of one unsullied by  excesses, impurities, or vices. And it is not the least of his merits  that, in an age of bigotry and narrow-mindedness, he was not intolerant  towards those whose religious views happened to differ from his own.      VII    _Evelyn's Literary Works._    Evelyn's earliest publications, some of which have already been referred  to, consisted mostly in translations from the French, Latin, and Greek,  that of the first book of Lucretius' _De Rerum Natura_ being in verse.  Their authorship was usually veiled either under Greek pseudonyms or  else more thinly under the initials 'J.E.' That on _A Character of  England_ (1659), a tract purporting to have been written by a foreigner,  appeared anonymously.    Of all these seven publications appearing before the Restoration, the  only one of any importance was _The French Gardener_, the translation of  a work by N. de Bonnefons, which appeared at the end of 1658 and was  thus referred to in the diary,--'Dec. 6th. Now was publish'd my \"French  Gardener,\" the first and best of the kind that introduc'd ye use of the  Olitorie garden to any purpose.' Subsequent editions of it appeared in  1669, 1672, 1691, bearing Evelyn's name on the titlepage in place of the  _Philocepos_ on its first publication.    With the Restoration, bringing to him greater personal freedom of  thought and speech, came the most active period of Evelyn's literary  production. His loyalty at once found opportunity to answer a libel on  King Charles (entitled _News from Brussels_) in _The late News from  Brussels unmasked_, a long vindication of his Majesty from the calumnies  and scandal therein fixed on him. From a literary and antiquarian point  of view, however, far greater interest attaches to a much shorter  treatise entitled _Fumifugium: or the Inconvenience of the Aer and Smoak  of London Dissipated, together with some Remedies humbly proposed_. As  this is the earliest reference to the great London Smoke Nuisance,  which, like the poor, we have always with us, it is of more than passing  interest to know how large this difficult problem of curing it loomed  about two and a half centuries ago. Moreover, this short work affords a  very typical example of Evelyn's literary style, while at the same time  well exemplyfying his profusely enthusiastic outbursts of devoted and  loyal attachment to the King's person and interests.    In the dull days of autumn and winter, when the heavy, damp air wafted  inwards from the sea shrouds London with a dirty pall of fog thickened  and discoloured with the smoke belched forth skywards from the long  throats of thousands of tall factory chimneys and emitted from hundreds  of thousands of household and workshop fires, the dweller in this vast  overgrown city is tempted to range himself for the moment among the  belauders of better times in the past. Almost groping his way along the  streets in semi-darkness, and half choked with the sulphurous surcharge  in the atmosphere, this latter-day growler may perhaps be astonished to  learn that his complaint is of very old standing, and that long before  the days of his great-great-grandfather, in fact more than seven  generations ago, this poisoning of the atmosphere with the impurities  given off from 'sea-coal' and other combustibles had already come to be  looked on by some as a public nuisance. It will, therefore, interest  Londoners in general, and will delight the hearts of Sir William  Richmond R.A. and the County Council in particular, to know that their  great precursor in this matter of reform nearly 250 years ago considered  the question even then one of urgency, admitting of no delay. How  graphic, and how refreshing, is the pithy point thus neatly scored--    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2078"],[0,"Thais (#11)"],[1,"loved Lollius with all the passion of her mind, and the  bewilderment of innocence. She told him, and told him truly from the  bottom of her heart--    \"I have never loved any one but you.\"    Lollius replied--    \"You are not like any other woman.\"    The spell lasted six months, but it broke at last. Thais suddenly felt  that her heart was empty and lonely. Lollius no longer seemed the same  to her. She thought--    \"What can have thus changed me in an instant? How is it that he is now  like any other man, and no longer like himself?\"    She left him, not without a secret desire to find Lollius again in  another, as she no longer found him in himself. She thought it would be  less dull to live with someone she had never loved, than with one she  had ceased to love. She appeared, in the company of rich debauchees, at  those sacred feasts at which naked virgins danced in the temples, and  troops of courtesans swam across the Orontes. She took part in all the  pleasures of the fashionable and depraved city; and she assiduously  frequented the theatres, at which clever mimes from all countries  performed amidst the applause of a crowd greedy for excitement.    She carefully observed the mimes, dancers, comedians, and especially the  women, who in tragedies represented goddesses in love with young men, or  mortals loved by the gods. Having discovered the secrets by which they  pleased the audience, she thought to herself that she was more beautiful  and could act better. She went to the manager, and asked to be admitted  into the troupe. Thanks to her beauty, and to the lessons she had  received from old Moeroe, she was received, and appeared on the stage in  the part of Dirce.    She met with but indifferent success, for she was inexperienced, and the  admiration of the spectators had not been aroused by hearing her praises  sung. But after she had played small parts for a few months, the power  of her beauty burst forth with such effect that all the city was moved.  All Antioch crowded to the theatre. The imperial magistrates and the  chief citizens were compelled, by the force of public opinion, to show  themselves there. The porters, sweepers, and dock labourers went without  bread and garlic, that they might pay for their places. Poets composed  epigrams in her honour. Bearded philosophers inveighed against her in  the baths and gymnasia; when her litter passed, Christian priests turned  away their heads. The threshold of her door was wreathed with flowers,  and sprinkled with blood. She received so much money from her lovers  that it was no longer counted, but measured by the medimnus, and all the  treasure hoarded by miserly old men was poured out at her feet. But  she was placid and unmoved. She rejoiced, with quiet pride, in the  admiration of the public and the favour of the gods, and was so much  loved that she loved herself.    After she had several years enjoyed the admiration and affection of the  Antiochians, she was taken with a desire to revisit Alexandria, and show  her glory in that city in which, as a child, she had wandered in want  and shame, hungry and lean as a grasshopper in the middle of a dusty  road. The golden city joyfully welcomed her, and loaded her with fresh  riches; when she appeared in the games it was a triumph. Countless  admirers and lovers came to her. She received them with indifference,  for she at last despaired of meeting another Lollius.    Amongst many others, she met the philosopher Nicias, who desired to  possess her, although he professed to have no desires. In spite of  his riches, he was intelligent and modest. But his delicate wit and  beautiful sentiments failed to charm her. She did not love him and  sometimes his refined irony even irritated her. His perpetual doubts  hurt her, for he believed in nothing, and she believed in everything.  She believed in divine providence, in the omnipotence of evil spirits,  in spells, exorcisms, and eternal justice; she believed in Jesus Christ,  and in the goddess of good of the Syrians; she believed also that  bitches barked when black Hecate passed through the streets, and that a  woman could inspire love by pouring a philtre into a cup wrapped in the  bleeding skin of a sheep. She thirsted for the unknown; she called on  nameless gods, and lived in perpetual expectation. The future frightened  her, and yet she wished to know it. She surrounded herself with priests  of Isis, Chaldean magi, pharmacopolists, and professors of the black  arts, who invariably deceived her, though she never tired of being  deceived. She feared death, and she saw it everywhere. When she yielded  to pleasure, it seemed to her that an icy finger would suddenly touch  her on the bare shoulder, and she turned pale, and cried with terror, in  the arms which embraced her.    Nicias said to her--    \"What does it matter, O my Thais, whether we descend to eternal night  with white locks and hollow cheeks, or, whether this very day, now  laughing to the vast sky, shall be our last? Let us enjoy life; we  shall have greatly lived if we have greatly loved. There is no knowledge  except that of the senses; to love is to understand. That which we  do not know does not exist. What good is it to worry ourselves about  nothing?\"    She replied angrily--    \"I despise men like you, who hope for nothing and fear nothing. I wish  to know! I wish to know!\"    In order to understand the secret of life, she set to work to read the  books of the philosophers, but she did not understand them. The further  the years of her childhood receded from her, the more anxious she was  to recall them. She loved to traverse at night, in disguise, the alleys,  squares, and places where she had grown up so miserably. She was sorry  she had lost her parents, and especially that she had not been able  to love them. When she met any Christian priest, she thought of her  baptism, and felt troubled. One night, when enveloped in a long  cloak, and her fair hair hidden under a black hood, she was wandering,  according to custom, about the suburbs of the city, she found  herself--without knowing how she came there--before the poor little  church of St. John the Baptist. They were singing inside the church,  and a bright light glimmered through the chinks of the door. There was  nothing strange in that, as, for the past twenty years, the Christians,  protected by the conqueror of Maxentius, had publicly solemnised their  festivals. But these hymns seemed more like an ardent appeal to the  soul. As if she had been invited to the mysteries, she pushed the  door open with her arm, and entered the building. She found a numerous  assembly of women, children, and old men, on their knees before a tomb,  which stood against the wall. The tomb was nothing but a stone coffer,  roughly sculptured with vine tendrils and bunches of grapes; yet it had  received great honours, and was covered with green palms and wreaths  of red roses. All round, innumerable lights gleamed out of the heavy  shadow, in which the smoke of Arabian gums seemed like the folds of  angels' robes, and the paintings on the walls visions of Paradise.  Priests, clad in white, were prostrate at the foot of the sarcophagus.  The hymns they sang with the people expressed the delight of suffering,  and mingled, in a triumphal mourning, so much joy with so much grief,  that Thais, in listening to them, felt the pleasures of life and the  terrors of death flowing, at the same time, through her re-awakened  senses.    When they had finished singing, the believers rose, and walked in single  file to the tomb, the side of which they kissed. They were common men,  accustomed to work with their hands. They advanced with a heavy step,  the eyes fixed, the jaw dropped, but they had an air of sincerity. They  knelt down, each in turn, before the sarcophagus, and put their lips  to it. The women lifted their little children in their arms, and gently  placed their cheek to the stone.    Thais, surprised and troubled, asked a deacon why they did so.    \"Do you not know, woman,\" replied the deacon, \"that we celebrate to-day  the blessed memory of St. Theodore the Nubian, who suffered for the  faith in the days of the Emperor Diocletian? He lived virtuously and  died a martyr, and that is why, robed in white, we bear red roses to his  glorious tomb.\"    On hearing these words, Thais fell on her knees, and burst into tears.  Half-forgotten recollections of Ahmes returned to her mind. On the  memory of this obscure, gentle, and unfortunate man, the blaze of  candles, the perfume of roses, the clouds of incense, the music of  hymns, the piety of souls, threw all the charms of glory. Thais thought  in the dazzling glare--    \"He was good, and now he has become great and glorious. Why is it that  he is elevated above other men? What is this unknown thing which is more  than riches or pleasure?\"    She rose slowly, and turned towards the tomb of the saint who had loved  her, those violet eyes, now filled with tears which glittered in the  candle-light; then, with bowed head, humble, slow, and the last, with  those lips on which so many desires hung, she kissed the stone of the  slave's tomb.    When she returned to her house, she found Nicias, who, with his hair  perfumed, and his tunic thrown open, was reading a treatise on morals  whilst waiting for her. He advanced with open arms.    \"Naughty Thais,\" he said, in a laughing voice, \"whilst I was waiting for  you to come, do you know what I saw in this manuscript, written by the  gravest of Stoics? Precepts of virtue and noble maxims: No! On the staid  papyrus, I saw dance thousands and thousands of little Thaises. Each was  no bigger than my finger, and yet their grace was infinite, and all were  the only Thais. There were some who flaunted in mantles of purple and  gold; others, like a white cloud, floated in the air in transparent  drapery. Others again, motionless and divinely nude, the better to "]]]
