[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2376"],[0,"Up from Slavery: An Autobiography (#11)"],[1," vacation ending and I did not have the sixteen dollars.    One day, during the last week of my stay in the restaurant, I found  under one of the tables a crisp, new ten-dollar bill. I could hardly  contain myself, I was so happy. As it was not my place of business I  felt it to be the proper thing to show the money to the proprietor. This  I did. He seemed as glad as I was, but he coolly explained to me that,  as it was his place of business, he had a right to keep the money, and  he proceeded to do so. This, I confess, was another pretty hard blow  to me. I will not say that I became discouraged, for as I now look  back over my life I do not recall that I ever became discouraged over  anything that I set out to accomplish. I have begun everything with  the idea that I could succeed, and I never had much patience with the  multitudes of people who are always ready to explain why one cannot  succeed. I determined to face the situation just as it was. At the end  of the week I went to the treasurer of the Hampton Institute, General  J.F.B. Marshall, and told him frankly my condition. To my gratification  he told me that I could reenter the institution, and that he would trust  me to pay the debt when I could. During the second year I continued to  work as a janitor.    The education that I received at Hampton out of the text-books was but  a small part of what I learned there. One of the things that impressed  itself upon me deeply, the second year, was the unselfishness of the  teachers. It was hard for me to understand how any individuals could  bring themselves to the point where they could be so happy in working  for others. Before the end of the year, I think I began learning that  those who are happiest are those who do the most for others. This lesson  I have tried to carry with me ever since.    I also learned a valuable lesson at Hampton by coming into contact with  the best breeds of live stock and fowls. No student, I think, who  has had the opportunity of doing this could go out into the world and  content himself with the poorest grades.    Perhaps the most valuable thing that I got out of my second year was an  understanding of the use and value of the Bible. Miss Nathalie Lord, one  of the teachers, from Portland, Me., taught me how to use and love the  Bible. Before this I had never cared a great deal about it, but now I  learned to love to read the Bible, not only for the spiritual help which  it gives, but on account of it as literature. The lessons taught me in  this respect took such a hold upon me that at the present time, when I  am at home, no matter how busy I am, I always make it a rule to read a  chapter or a portion of a chapter in the morning, before beginning the  work of the day.    Whatever ability I may have as a public speaker I owe in a measure  to Miss Lord. When she found out that I had some inclination in this  direction, she gave me private lessons in the matter of breathing,  emphasis, and articulation. Simply to be able to talk in public for the  sake of talking has never had the least attraction to me. In fact,  I consider that there is nothing so empty and unsatisfactory as mere  abstract public speaking; but from my early childhood I have had a  desire to do something to make the world better, and then to be able to  speak to the world about that thing.    The debating societies at Hampton were a constant source of delight to  me. These were held on Saturday evening; and during my whole life at  Hampton I do not recall that I missed a single meeting. I not only  attended the weekly debating society, but was instrumental in organizing  an additional society. I noticed that between the time when supper was  over and the time to begin evening study there were about twenty minutes  which the young men usually spent in idle gossip. About twenty of us  formed a society for the purpose of utilizing this time in debate or in  practice in public speaking. Few persons ever derived more happiness or  benefit from the use of twenty minutes of time than we did in this way.    At the end of my second year at Hampton, by the help of some money sent  me by my mother and brother John, supplemented by a small gift from  one of the teachers at Hampton, I was enabled to return to my home in  Malden, West Virginia, to spend my vacation. When I reached home I found  that the salt-furnaces were not running, and that the coal-mine was not  being operated on account of the miners being out on \"strike.\" This was  something which, it seemed, usually occurred whenever the men got two or  three months ahead in their savings. During the strike, of course, they  spent all that they had saved, and would often return to work in debt at  the same wages, or would move to another mine at considerable expense.  In either case, my observations convinced me that the miners were worse  off at the end of the strike. Before the days of strikes in that section  of the country, I knew miners who had considerable money in the bank,  but as soon as the professional labour agitators got control, the  savings of even the more thrifty ones began disappearing.    My mother and the other members of my family were, of course, much  rejoiced to see me and to note the improvement that I had made during  my two years' absence. The rejoicing on the part of all classes of the  coloured people, and especially the older ones, over my return, was  almost pathetic. I had to pay a visit to each family and take a meal  with each, and at each place tell the story of my experiences at  Hampton. In addition to this I had to speak before the church and  Sunday-school, and at various other places. The thing that I was most in  search of, though, work, I could not find. There was no work on account  of the strike. I spent nearly the whole of the first month of my  vacation in an effort to find something to do by which I could earn  money to pay my way back to Hampton and save a little money to use after  reaching there.    Toward the end of the first month, I went to a place a considerable  distance from my home, to try to find employment. I did not succeed, and  it was night before I got started on my return. When I had gotten within  a mile or so of my home I was so completely tired out that I could not  walk any farther, and I went into an old, abandoned house to spend the  remainder of the night. About three o'clock in the morning my brother  John found me asleep in this house, and broke to me, as gently as he  could, the sad news that our dear mother had died during the night.    This seemed to me the saddest and blankest moment in my life. For  several years my mother had not been in good health, but I had no idea,  when I parted from her the previous day, that I should never see her  alive again. Besides that, I had always had an intense desire to be with  her when she did pass away. One of the chief ambitions which spurred  me on at Hampton was that I might be able to get to be in a position in  which I could better make my mother comfortable and happy. She had so  often expressed the wish that she might be permitted to live to see her  children educated and started out in the world.    In a very short time after the death of my mother our little home was  in confusion. My sister Amanda, although she tried to do the best  she could, was too young to know anything about keeping house, and my  stepfather was not able to hire a housekeeper. Sometimes we had food  cooked for us, and sometimes we did not. I remember that more than once  a can of tomatoes and some crackers constituted a meal. Our clothing  went uncared for, and everything about our home was soon in a  tumble-down condition. It seems to me that this was the most dismal  period of my life.    My good friend, Mrs. Ruffner, to whom I have already referred, always  made me welcome at her home, and assisted me in many ways during this  trying period. Before the end of the vacation she gave me some work, and  this, together with work in a coal-mine at some distance from my home,  enabled me to earn a little money.    At one time it looked as if I would have to give up the idea of  returning to Hampton, but my heart was so set on returning that I  determined not to give up going back without a struggle. I was very  anxious to secure some clothes for the winter, but in this I was  disappointed, except for a few garments which my brother John secured  for me. Notwithstanding my need of money and clothing, I was very  happy in the fact that I had secured enough money to pay my travelling  expenses back to Hampton. Once there, I knew that I could make myself  so useful as a janitor that I could in some way get through the school  year.    Three weeks before the time for the opening of the term at Hampton, I  was pleasantly surprised to receive a letter from my good friend Miss  Mary F. Mackie, the lady principal, asking me to return to Hampton two  weeks before the opening of the school, in order that I might assist her  in cleaning the buildings and getting things in order for the new school  year. This was just the opportunity I wanted. It gave me a chance to  secure a credit in the treasurer's office. I started for Hampton at  once.    During these two weeks I was taught a lesson which I shall never forget.  Miss Mackie was a member of one of the oldest and most cultured families  of the North, and yet for two weeks she worked by my side cleaning  windows, dusting rooms, putting beds in order, and what not. She felt  that things would not be in condition for the opening of school unless  every window-pane was perfectly clean, and she took the greatest  satisfaction in helping to clean them herself. The work which I have  described she did every year that I was at Hampton.    It was hard for me at this time to understand how a woman of her  education and social standing could take such delight in performing such  service, in order to assist in the elevation of an unfortunate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23770"],[0,"Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 1 (#11)"],[1,"plant stand shown in the illustration secure the  following list of quarter-sawed white-oak stock, cut and finished to  size:      1 top, 3/4 by 15-1/2 by 15-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 posts, 1-1/4 by 1-1/4 by 20 in., S-4-S.    4 rails, 3/4 by 3 by 11 in., S-2-S.    2 rails, 3/4 by 2 by 11 in., S-2-S.    1 shelf, 3/4 by 6 by 10 in., S-2-S.    4 slats, 1/4 by 2 by 12-1/4 in., S-2-S.    2 slats, 1/4 by 2 by 12-3/4 in., S-2-S.    Test all surfaces of the posts with a try-square to see that they are  square with each other. Lay out the tenons on the ends of the rails as  shown in the sketch and cut with a tenon saw and chisel. Arrange the  posts and rails as they are to stand and number each tenon and mortise.  Lay out the mortises in the legs, taking the measurements directly from  the tenon which is to fit that mortise. Cut the mortises, first having  bored to the depth with a 1/4-in. bit.    [Illustration: Detail of the Plant Stand]    The slats should now be made and mortised into the top rail 1/4 in. They  come outside of the lower rail and are held to it with two small brads,  fancy-headed tacks, or round-head screws.    In laying out the mortises for the lower rails, care must be taken to  have them set 1/8 in. farther in than the upper rails so the slats may  come outside.    Set up the stand without glue or screws to see that all pieces fit  accurately. Then glue up the sides with the slats first. After these  have set for 24 hours, fit in the other two rails and the shelf. Three  flat-head screws should be used to hold the shelf in place. These must  be placed so the slats will cover them when they are attached.    [Illustration: Complete Plant Stand]    When this work is completed it is ready for the top. A good method of  attaching the top is shown in the sketch. The screws used for fastening  should be 2-in. No. 10. Bore into the rail 1-1/2 in. with a bit 1/16 in.  larger than the head of the screw. Then bore through the rest of the way  with a bit a little larger than the shank of the screw. Thus a little  space is left for expansion and shrinkage of the top.    Scrape and sandpaper thoroughly to remove all marks or glue spots.  Finish with two coats of weathered-oak stain, followed by two coats of  black wax.          A BEDSIDE MEDICINE STAND      The accompanying sketch and detail drawing show a design of a bedside  stand. This is a very desirable piece of furniture and is simple and  easy to make. Quarter-sawed oak is the best wood to use in its  construction. The material should be ordered from the mill ready cut to  length, squared and sanded. The following list of material will be  required:      4 posts, 1-3/4 by 1-3/4 by 33 in., S-4-S.    1 top board, 1 by 19 by 19 in., S-4-S.    3 intermediate boards, 3/4 by 15-1/2 by 17 in., S-4-S.    2 side boards, 3/4 by 5 by 15-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 back board, 3/4 by 4-1/4 by 14-1/2 in., S-4-S.    4 side rails, 3/4 by 2 by 16 in., S-4-S.    1 door, 3/4 by 9 by 14-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 back board, 3/4 by 10-1/4 by 14-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 panels, 3/8 by 9-1/2 by 15 in., S-4-S.    6 slats, 1/4 by 1 by 8-3/4 in., S-4-S.    1 drawer front, 3/4 by 4-1/4 by 14-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 sides for drawer, 1/2 by 4-1/4 by 16 in., S-4-S.    1 back for drawer, 1/2 by 4-1/4 by 13-1/2 in., soft wood.    1 bottom for drawer, 1/2 by 13-1/2 by 15 in., soft wood.    [Illustration: Medicine Stand in Quarter-Sawed Oak]    Start work on the four posts by rounding the top corners and shaping the  feet as shown. The four posts are identical and the mortises should be  laid out on all four at once so as to get them all alike. These should  be carefully cut with a sharp chisel. On the inner surface of each leg  cut a groove to hold the side boards of the lower compartment. Next  prepare the two wide and the four narrow crosspieces, tenoning them to  fit the mortises already cut in the legs. The lower crosspieces should  also have grooves cut in them to hold the side boards of the  compartment. The two complete sides can now be glued and clamped  together and set away to dry. While they are drying the remaining parts  of the stand can be made. The three horizontal boards are now made by  notching out the corners to fit around the legs. They are supported by  fastening small cleats to the inner surface of each crosspiece.    [Illustration: Detail of the Medicine Stand]    The two ends can now be set up and connected. Notch out the corners of  the top board and fit it in place. The top is fastened down by means of  screws set in at an angle from below. The back boards can be of soft  wood and are fastened in place in the usual manner. The door should be  of one piece if possible and should have suitable hinges and a catch.    Make and fit the drawer in place, and the stand is ready for the finish.  First scrape all the surplus glue from about the points so the stain  will not be kept from the wood. Finish smooth with fine sandpaper, then  apply stain of the color desired.          A MISSION HALL CHAIR      This hall chair is designed to take up as little room as possible. For  its construction the following stock will be needed:      1 back, 7/8 by 14 by 44 in., S-2-S.    2 sides, 7/8 by 14 by 17 in., S-2-S.    1 seat, 7/8 by 14 by 14 in., S-2-S.    1 stretcher, 7/8 by 6 by 16 in., S-2-S.    1 brace, 7/8 by 5 by 11 in., S-2-S.    1 piece, 7/8 by 7/8 by 44 in., for cleats.    These dimensions are for finished pieces, therefore 1/4 in. should be  allowed for planing if the stock cannot be secured finished.    Lay out and cut the design on the back, sides, and brace. To cut the  openings, first bore a hole near one corner to get the blade of a coping  saw through and proceed to saw to the lines. Smooth the edges after  sawing by taking a thin shaving with a sharp chisel. A file will not  leave a good surface.    Mark the tenons on the ends of the stretcher and cut them with a backsaw  and make smooth with a chisel. From the tenons mark the mortises in the  sides through which they are to pass.    [Illustration: Detail of the Hall Chair]    [Illustration: Complete Hall Chair in Plain Oak]    To cut these mortises, first bore a row of holes with a 5/8 in. bit,  boring halfway from each side so as not to split off any pieces. Now  make of scrap material the two keys and from them mark the small  mortises in the tenons.    Before putting the chair together, the cleats for holding the seat  should be fastened to the sides, back and brace. Use flat-head screws  for this purpose. Then put the sides and stretcher together, and fasten  the back to the sides with flat-head screws.    The brace should be put in next, using three round-head screws in each  end. There only remains the top, which is held by screws through the  cleats from the under side.    Stain with two coats of weathered or mission-oak stain, and then apply a  thin coat of \"under-lac\" or shellac and two coats of wax.
