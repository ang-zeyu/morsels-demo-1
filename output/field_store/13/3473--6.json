He was like John  Randolph, said Adams, who for forty years was always dying. \"He is now  alternately giving out his chronic diarrhoea and making Warren bleed him  for a pleurisy, and posting to Cambridge for a doctorate of laws,  mounting the monument of Bunker's Hill to hear a fulsome address and  receive two cannon-balls from Edward Everett.\"    To be sure, manifestations of a contrary spirit between the political  parties were not wanting. The entire nation mourned for Madison after  his death in 1836, as it had on the decease of Jefferson and John Adams  both on the same day, July 4, 1826.    A note or two upon costume may not uninterestingly close this chapter.    Enormous bonnets were fashionable about 1830. Ladies also wore Leghorn  hats, with very broad brims rolled up behind, tricked out profusely with  ribbons and artificial flowers. Dress-waists were short and high. Skirts  were short, too, hardly reaching the ankles. Sleeves were of the  leg-of-mutton fashion, very full above the elbows but tightening toward  the wrist. Gentlemen still dressed for the street not so differently  from the revolutionary style. Walking-coats were of broadcloth, blue,  brown, or green, to suit the taste, with gilt buttons. Bottle-green was  a very stylish color for evening coats. Blue and the gilt buttons for  street wear were, however, beginning to be discarded, Daniel Webster  being one of the last to walk abroad in them. The buff waistcoat, white  cambric cravat, and ruffled shirt still held their own. Collars for full  dress were worn high, covering half the cheek, a fashion which persisted  in parts of the country till 1850 or later.        CHAPTER VIII.    INDUSTRIAL ADVANCE BY 1840    [1840]    During the War of 1812 we had in England an industrial spy, whose  campaign there has perhaps accomplished more for the country than all  our armies did. It was Francis C. Lowell, of Boston. Great Britain was  just introducing the power loom. The secret of structure was guarded  with all vigilance, yet Lowell, passing from cotton factory to cotton  factory with Yankee eyes, ears, and wit, came home in 1814, believing,  with good reason, as it proved, that he could set up one of the machines  on American soil. Broad Street in Boston was the scene of his initial  experiments, but the factory to the building of which they led was at  Waltham. It was owned by a company, one of whose members was Nathan  Appleton. Water furnished the motive power. By the autumn of 1814 Lowell  had perfected his looms and placed them in the factory. Spinning  machinery was also built, mounting seventeen hundred spindles. English  cotton-workers did not as yet spin and weave under the same roof, so  that the Lowell Mill at Waltham may, with great probability, be  pronounced the first in the world to carry cloth manufacture  harmoniously through all its several successive steps from the raw stuff  to the finished ware.    From this earliest establishment of the power-loom here, the  cotton-cloth business strode rapidly forward. Fall River, Holyoke,  Lawrence, Lowell, and scores of other thriving towns sprung into being.  Every year new mills were built. In 1831 there were 801; in 1840, 1,240;  in 1850, 1,074. Henceforth, through consolidation, the number of  factories decreased, but the number of spindles grew steadily larger.  This rise of great manufacturing concerns was facilitated by a new order  of corporation laws. There had been corporations in the country before  1830, as the Waltham case shows; but the system had had little  evolution, as incorporation had in each case to proceed from a special  legislative act. In 1837 Connecticut passed a statute making this  unnecessary and enabling a group of persons to become a corporation on  complying with certain simple requirements. New York placed a similar  provision in its constitution of 1846. The Dartmouth College decision of  the United States Supreme Court in 1819, interpreting an act of  incorporation as a contract, which, by the Constitution, no State can  violate, still further humored and aided the corporation system.      [Illustration: Train schedule.]  From an Old Time-table. (Furnished by the ABC Pathfinder Railway Guide.)      In 1816 the streets of Baltimore were lighted with gas. A gas-light  company was incorporated in New York in 1823. Not till 1836, however,  did the Philadelphia streets have gas lights. The first savings-banks  were established in Philadelphia and Boston in 1816. Baltimore had one  two years later. Portable fire-proof safes were used in 1820. The Lehigh  coal trade flourished this year, and also the manufacture of iron with  coal. The whale fishery, too, was now beginning. The first factory in  Lowell started in 1821. In 1822 there was a copper rolling mill in  Baltimore, the only one then in America, and Paterson, N. J., began the  manufacture of cotton duck. Patent leather was made in the United States  by 1819. In 1824 Amesbury, Mass., had a water-power manufactory of  flannel. The next year the practice of homoeopathy began in America, and  matches of a rude sort were displacing the old tinder-box. The next  year after this Hartford produced axes and other edged tools.  Lithography, of which there had been specimens so early as 1818, was a  Boston business in 1827. Pittsburgh manufactured damask table linen in  1828. The same year saw paper made from straw, and planing machinery in  operation. The insuring of lives began in this country in 1812.      [Illustration: Two rail cars that look like ordinary wagons with iron  wheels. One is pulled by a horse, the other by a primitive steam engine.]  Trial between Peter Cooper's Locomotive \"Tom Thumb\" and one of Stockton's  and Stokes' Horse Cars. From \"History of the First Locomotive in  America.\"      The first figured muslin woven by the power-loom in America, and perhaps  in the world, was produced at Central Falls, R. I., in 1829. Calico  printing began at Lowell the same year, also the manufacture of cutlery  at Worcester, of sewing-silk at Mansfield, Conn., of galvanized iron in  New York City. With the new decade chloroform was invented, in 1831,  being first used as a medicine, not as an anaesthetic. Reaping machines  were on trial the same year, and three years later machine-made wood  screws were turned out at Providence. About the same time, 1832, pins  were made by machinery, hosiery was woven by a power-loom process, and  Colt perfected his revolver. In 1837 brass clocks were put upon the  American market, and by 1840 extensively exported. Also in 1837 Nashua  was making machinists' tools. By 1839 the manufacture of iron with hard  coal was a pronounced success. In 1840 daguerreotypes began to appear.  Steam fire-engines were seen the next year.      [Illustration: Peter Cooper's Locomotive, 1829.]      So early as 1816 the New York and Philadelphia stages made the distance  from city to city between sun and sun. The National Road from Cumberland  was finished to Wheeling in 1820, having been fourteen years in  construction and costing $17,000,000. It was subsequently extended  westward across Ohio and Indiana. It was thirty-five feet wide,  thoroughly macadamized, and had no grade of above five degrees. Over  parts of this road no less than 150 six-horse teams passed daily,  besides four or five four-horse mail and passenger coaches. In Jackson's  time, when for some months there was talk of war with France and extra  measures were thought proper for assuring the loyalty of Louisiana,  swift mail connections were made with the Mississippi by the National  Road. Its entire length was laid out into sections of sixty-three miles  apiece, each with three boys and nine horses, only six hours and  eighteen minutes being allowed for traversing a section, viz., a rate of  about ten miles an hour. Great men and even presidents travelled by the  public coaches of this road, though many of them used their own  carriages. James K. Polk often made the journey from Nashville to  Washington in his private carriage. Keeping down the Cumberland River to  the Ohio, and up this to Wheeling, he would strike into the National  Road eastward to Cumberland, Md. He came thus so late as 1845, to be  inaugurated as President; only at this time he used the new railway from  Cumberland to the Relay House, where he changed to the other new railway  which had already joined Baltimore with Washington.      [Illustration: One side is an image of a rail car, the other a signature.]  Obverse and Reverse of a Ticket used in 1838 on the New York & Harlem  Railroad.      The first omnibus made its appearance in New York in 1830, the name  itself originating from the word painted upon this vehicle. The first  street railway was laid two years later. The era of the stage coach was  at this time beginning to end, that of canals and railroads opening. Yet  in the remoter sections of the country the old coach was destined to  hold its place for decades still. Where roads were fair it would not  uncommonly make one hundred miles between early morning and late  evening, as between Boston and Springfield, Springfield and Albany. So  soon as available the canal packet was a much more easy and elegant  means of travel. The Erie Canal was begun in 1817, finished to Rochester  in 1823, the first boat arriving October 8th. The year 1825 carried it  to Buffalo. The Blackstone Canal, between Worcester and Providence, was  opened its whole length in 1828; the next year many others, as the  Chesapeake and Delaware, the Cumberland and Oxford in Maine, the  Farmington in Connecticut, the Oswego, connecting the Erie Canal with  Lake Ontario, also the Delaware"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23755"],[0,"Birds of the Indian Hills (#11)"],[1,"feed. To mistake a kite is  impossible. Throughout the day it makes the welkin ring with its  querulous _chee-hee-hee-hee-hee_. Some kites are larger than others,  consequently ornithologists, who are never so happy as when splitting  up species, have made a separate species of the larger race. This  latter is called _Milvus melanotis_, the large Indian kite. It is  common in the hills.    The kestrel (_Tinnunculus alaudarius_) is perhaps the easiest of all  the birds of prey to identify. It is a greyish fowl with dull brick-red  wings and shoulders. Its flight is very distinctive. It flaps the  wings more rapidly than do most of its kind. While beating over the  country it checks its flight now and again and hovers on rapidly  vibrating wings. It does this when it fancies it has seen a mouse,  lizard, or other living thing moving on the ground below. If its  surmise proves correct, it drops from above and thus takes its quarry  completely by surprise. It is on account of this peculiar habit of  hovering in the air that the kestrel is often called the wind-hover  in England. Needless to say, the kestrel affects open tracts rather  than forest country. One of these birds is usually to be seen engaged  in its craft above the bare slope of the hill on which Mussoorie is  built. Other places where kestrels are always to be seen are the bare  hills round Almora. The nest of this species is usually placed on  an inaccessible crag.      THE COLUMBIDAE OR DOVE FAMILY    The cooing community is not much in evidence in the hills. In the  Himalayas doves do not obtrude themselves upon our notice in the way  that they do in the plains.    The green-pigeon of the mountains is the kokla (_Sphenocercus  sphenurus_), so called on account of its melodious call, _kok-la_,  _kok-la_. In appearance it is very like the green-pigeon of the plains  and is equally difficult to distinguish from its leafy surroundings.  The bronze-winged dove (_Chalcophaps indica_) I have never observed  at any hill-station, but it is abundant in the lower ranges and in  the Terai. Every sportsman must be familiar with the bird. Its  magnificent bronzed metallic, green plumage renders its  identification easy. The commonest dove of the Himalayan  hill-stations is the Indian turtle-dove (_Turtur ferago_). Its  plumage is of that grey hue which is so characteristic of doves as  to be called dove-colour. The turtle-dove has a conspicuous patch  of black-and-white feathers on each side of the neck. The only other  dove seen in the hills with which it can be confounded is the little  brown dove (_T. cambayensis_). The latter is a much smaller bird,  and I have not observed it anywhere higher than 4500 feet above the  sea-level.    The spotted dove (_T. suratensis_) occurs in small numbers in most  parts of the Himalayas up to 7000 feet. It is distinguished by the  wing coverts being spotted with rufous and black.    The Indian ring-dove (_T. risorius_) also occurs in the Western  Himalayas. It is of a paler hue than the other doves and has no patch  of black-and-white feathers on the sides of the neck, but has a black  collar, with a narrow white border, round the back of the neck.    One other dove should perhaps be mentioned among the common birds  of the Himalayas, namely, the bar-tailed cuckoo-dove (_Macropygia  tusalia_). A dove with a long barred tail, of which the feathers are  graduated, the median ones being the longest, may be set down as this  species.      THE PHASIANIDAE OR FAMILY OF GAME BIRDS    The Himalayas are the home of many species of gallinaceous birds.  In the highest ranges the snow-cocks, the tragopans, the  blood-pheasant, and the glorious monaul or Impeyan pheasant abound.  The foothills are the happy hunting-grounds of the ancestral  cock-a-doodle-doo.    As this book is written with the object of enabling persons staying  at the various hill-stations to identify the commoner birds, I do  not propose to describe the gallinaceous denizens of the higher ranges  or the foothills. In the ranges of moderate elevation, on which all  the hill-stations are situated, the kalij, the cheer, and the koklas  pheasants are common. Of these three the kalij is the only one likely  to be seen in the ordinary course of a walk. The others are not likely  to show themselves unless flushed by a dog.    The white-crested kalij-pheasant (_Gennaeus albicristatus_) may  occasionally be seen in the vicinity of a village.    The bird does not come up to the Englishman's ideal of a pheasant.  The bushy tail causes it to look rather like a product of the farmyard.  The cock is over two feet in length, the hen is five inches shorter.  The plumage of the former is dark brown, tinged with blue, each feather  having a pale margin. The rump is white with broad black bars. The  hen is uniformly brown, each feather having a narrow buff margin.  Both sexes rejoice in a long backwardly-directed crest and a patch  of bare crimson skin round each eye. The tail is much shorter and  more bushy than that of the English pheasant. The crest is white in  the cock and reddish yellow in the hen. Baldwin describes the call  of this pheasant as \"a sharp _twut_, _twut_, _twut_. Sometimes very  low, with a pause between each note, then suddenly increasing loudly  and excitedly.\"    The kalij usually affords rather poor sport.    The koklas pheasant (_Pucrasia macrolopha_) is another short-tailed  species; but it is more game-like in appearance than the kalij and  provides better sport.    It may be distinguished from the kalij by its not having the red patch  of skin round the eye. The cock of this species has a curious crest,  the middle portion of which is short and of a fawn colour; on each  side of this is a long lateral tuft coloured black with a green gloss.  The cry of this bird has been syllabised as _kok-kok-pokrass_.    In the cheer-pheasant (_Catreus wellichi_) both sexes have a long  crest, like that of the kalij, and a red patch of skin round the eye.  The tail of this species, however, is long and attenuated like that  of the English pheasant, measuring nearly two feet. Wilson says, of  the call of this bird: \"Both males and females often crow at daybreak  and dusk and, in cloudy weather, sometimes during the day. The crow  is loud and singular, and, when there is nothing to interrupt, the  sound may be heard for at least a mile. It is something like the words  _chir-a-pir_, _chir-a-pir_, _chir-a-pir_, _chirwa_, _chirwa_, but  a good deal varied.\"    The grey quail (_Coturnix communis_) is a common bird of the Himalayas  during a few days only in the year. Large numbers of these birds rest  in the fields of ripening grain in the course of their long migratory  flight. Almost as regularly as clockwork do they appear in the Western  Himalayas early in October on their way south, and again in April  on their northward journey. By walking through the terraced fields  at those times with a gun, considerable bags of quail can be secured.  These birds migrate at night. Writing of them, Hume said: \"One  moonlight night about the third week in April, standing at the top  of Benog, a few miles from Mussoorie, a dense cloud many hundred yards  in length and fifty yards, I suppose, in breadth of small birds swept  over me with the sound of a rushing wind. They were not, I believe,  twenty yards above the level of my head, and their quite unmistakable  call was uttered by several of those nearest me as they passed.\"    We must now consider the partridges that patronise the hills. The  species most commonly met with in the Himalayas is the chakor  (_Caccabis chucar_). In appearance this is very like the French or  red-legged partridge, to which it is related. Its prevailing hue is  pale reddish brown, the particular shade varying greatly with the  individual. The most striking features of this partridge are a black  band that runs across the forehead to the eyes and then down the sides  of the head round the throat, forming a gorget, and a number of black  bars on each flank. The favourite haunts of the chakor are bare grassy  hillsides on which a few terraced fields exist. Chakor are noisy birds.  The note most commonly heard is the double call from which their name  is taken.    The black partridge or common francolin (_Francolinus vulgaris_) is  abundant on the lower ranges of the Himalayas. At Mussoorie its  curious call is often heard. This is so high-pitched as to be inaudible  to some people. To those who can hear it, the call sounds like  _juk-juk-tee-tee-tur_. This species has the habit of feigning a  broken wing when an enemy approaches its young ones. The cock is a  very handsome bird. The prevailing hue of his plumage is black with  white spots on the flanks and narrow white bars on the back. The  feathers of the crown and wings are buff and dark brown. A chestnut  collar runs round the neck, while each side of the head is adorned  by a white patch. The whole plumage of the hen is coloured like the  wings of the cock.    The common hill-partridge (_Arboricola torqueola_) is a great  skulker. He haunts dark densely jungled water-courses and ravines,  and so is not likely to be seen about a hill-station; we will therefore  pass him over without description.      THE CHARADRIIDAE OR PLOVER FAMILY    In conclusion mention must be made of the woodcock (_Scolopax  rusticola_). This species, although it breeds throughout the  Himalayas, usually remains during the summer at altitudes above those  at which hill-stations are situate. The lowest height at which its  nest has been found is, I believe, 9500 feet.          _THE COMMON BIRDS OF THE EASTERN HIMALAYAS_      The majority of the birds which are common in the Eastern Himalayas  are also abundant in the western part of the range, and have in  consequence been described already.
