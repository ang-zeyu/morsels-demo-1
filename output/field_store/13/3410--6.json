There were six falcons living in a nest, five of whom were still too  young to fly, when it so happened that both the parent birds were shot  in one day. The young brood waited anxiously for their return; but night  came, and they were left without parents and without food.    Gray Eagle, the eldest, and the only one whose feathers had become stout  enough to enable him to leave the nest, took his place at the head of  the family, and assumed the duty of stifling their cries and providing  the little household with food, in which he was very successful. But,  after a short time had passed, by an unlucky mischance, while out on a  foraging excursion, he got one of his wings broken. This was the more to  be regretted, as the season had arrived when they were soon to go to a  southern country to pass the winter, and the children were only waiting  to become a little stronger and more expert on the wing to set out on  the journey.    Finding that their elder brother did not return, they resolved to go in  search of him. After beating up and down the country for the better part  of a whole day, they at last found him, sorely wounded and unable to  fly, lodged in the upper branches of a sycamore-tree.    \"Brothers,\" said Gray Eagle, as soon as they were gathered around, and  questioned him as to the extent of his injuries, \"an accident has  befallen me, but let not this prevent your going to a warmer climate.  Winter is rapidly approaching, and you can not remain here. It is better  that I alone should die, than for you all to suffer on my account.\"    \"No, no,\" they replied, with one voice. \"We will not forsake you. We  will share your sufferings; we will abandon our journey, and take care  of you as you did of us before we were able to take care of ourselves.  If the chill climate kills you, it shall kill us. Do you think we can so  soon forget your brotherly care, which has equaled a father's, and even  a mother's kindness? Whether you live or die, we will live or die with  you.\"    They sought out a hollow tree to winter in, and contrived to carry their  wounded nest-mate thither; and before the rigor of the season had set  in, they had, by diligence and economy, stored up food enough to carry  them through the winter months.    To make the provisions they had laid in last the better, it was agreed  among them that two of their number should go south; leaving the other  three to watch over, feed, and protect their wounded brother. The  travelers set forth, sorry to leave home, but resolved that the first  promise of spring should bring them back again. At the close of day, the  three brothers who remained, mounting to the very peak of the tree, and  bearing Gray Eagle in their arms, watched them, as they vanished away  southward, till their forms blended with the air and were wholly lost to  sight.    Their next business was to set the household in order, and this, with  the judicious direction of Gray Eagle, who was propped up in a snug  fork, with soft cushions of dry moss, they speedily accomplished. One of  the sisters, for there were two of these, took upon herself the charge  of nursing Gray Eagle, preparing his food, bringing him water, and  changing his pillows when he grew tired of one position. She also looked  to it that the house itself was kept in a tidy condition, and that the  pantry was supplied with food. The second brother was assigned the duty  of physician, and he was to prescribe such herbs and other medicines as  the state of the health of Gray Eagle seemed to require. As the second  brother had no other invalid on his visiting-list, he devoted the time  not given to the cure of his patient, to the killing of game wherewith  to stock the house-keeper's larder; so that, whatever he did, he was  always busy in the line of professional duty--killing or curing. On his  hunting excursions, Doctor Falcon carried with him his youngest brother,  who, being a foolish young fellow, and inexperienced in the ways of the  world, it was not thought safe to trust alone.    In due time, what with good nursing, and good feeding, and good air,  Gray Eagle recovered from his wound, and he repaid the kindness of his  brothers by giving them such advice and instruction in the art of  hunting as his age and experience qualified him to impart. As spring  advanced, they began to look about for the means of replenishing their  store-house, whose supplies were running low; and they were all quite  successful in their quest except the youngest, whose name was Peepi, or  the Pigeon-Hawk, and who had of late begun to set up for himself. Being  small and foolish, and feather-headed, flying hither and yonder without  any set purpose, it so happened that Peepi always came home, so to  phrase it, with an empty game-bag, and his pinions terribly rumpled.    At last Gray Eagle spoke to him, and demanded the cause of his ill-luck.    \"It is not my smallness nor weakness of body,\" Peepi answered, \"that  prevents my bringing home provender as well as my brothers. I am all the  time on the wing, hither and thither. I kill ducks and other birds every  time I go out; but just as I get to the woods, on my way home, I am met  by a large ko-ko-ho, who robs me of my prey; and,\" added Peepi, with  great energy, \"it's my settled opinion that the villain lies in wait for  the very purpose of doing so.\"    \"I have no doubt you are right, Brother Peepi,\" rejoined Gray Eagle. \"I  know this pirate--his name is White Owl; and now that I feel my strength  fully recovered, I will go out with you to-morrow and help you look  after this greedy bush-ranger.\"    The next day they went forth in company, and arrived at a fine  fresh-water lake. Gray Eagle seated himself hard by, while Peepi started  out, and soon pounced upon a duck.    \"Well done!\" thought his brother, who saw his success; but just as  little Peepi was getting to land with his prize, up sailed a large white  owl from a tree where he, too, had been watching, and laid claim to it.  He was on the point of wresting it from Peepi, when Gray Eagle, calling  out to the intruder to desist, rushed up, and, fixing his talons in both  sides of the owl, without further introduction or ceremony, flew away  with him.    The little Pigeon-Hawk followed closely, with the duck under his wing,  rejoiced and happy to think that he had something to carry home at last.  He was naturally much vexed with the owl, and had no sooner delivered  over the duck to his sister, the housekeeper, than he flew in the owl's  face, and, venting an abundance of reproachful terms, would, in his  passion, have torn the very eyes out of the White Owl's head.    \"Softly, Peepi,\" said the Gray Eagle, stepping in between them. \"Don't  be in such a huff, my little brother, nor exhibit so revengeful a  temper. Do you not know that we are to forgive our enemies? White Owl,  you may go; but let this be a lesson to you, not to play the tyrant over  those who may chance to be weaker than yourself.\"    So, after adding to this much more good advice, and telling him what  kind of herbs would cure his wounds, Gray Eagle dismissed White Owl, and  the four brothers and sisters sat down to supper.    The next day, betimes, in the morning, before the household had fairly  rubbed the cobwebs out of the corners of their eyes, there came a knock  at the front door--which was a dry branch that lay down before the  hollow of the tree in which they lodged--and being called to come in,  who should make their appearance but the two nest-mates, who had just  returned from the South, where they had been wintering. There was great  rejoicing over their return, and now that they were all happily  re-united, each one soon chose a mate and began to keep house in the  woods for himself.    Spring had now revisited the North. The cold winds had all blown  themselves away, the ice had melted, the streams were open, and smiled  as they looked at the blue sky once more; and the forests, far and wide,  in their green mantle, echoed every cheerful sound.    But it is in vain that spring returns, and that the heart of Nature is  opened in bounty, if we are not thankful to the Master of Life, who has  preserved us through the winter. Nor does that man answer the end for  which he was made who does not show a kind and charitable feeling to all  who are in want or sickness, especially to his blood relations.    The love and harmony of Gray Eagle and his brothers continued. They  never forgot each other. Every week, on the fourth afternoon of the week  (for that was the time when they had found their wounded elder brother),  they had a meeting in the hollow of the old sycamore-tree, when they  talked over family matters, and advised with each other, as brothers  should, about their affairs.          VIII.    THE TOAD-WOMAN.      Great good luck once happened to a young woman who was living all alone  in the woods with nobody near her but her little dog; for, to her  surprise, she found fresh meat every morning at her door. She was very  curious to know who it was that supplied her, and watching one morning,  just as the sun had risen, she saw a handsome young man gliding away  into the forest. Having seen her, he became her husband, and she had a  son by him.    One day, not long after this, he did not return at evening, as usual,  from hunting. She waited till late at night, but he came no more.    The next day, she swung her child to sleep in its cradle, and then said  to her dog, \"Take care of your brother while I am gone, and when he  cries, halloo for me.\"    The cradle was made of the finest wampum, and all its bandages and  ornaments were of the same precious stuff.    After a short time, the woman heard the cry of the dog, and running home  as fast as she could, she found her child gone, and the dog too. On  looking around, she saw scattered upon the ground pieces of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2225"],[0,"\"Captains Courageous\": A Story of the Grand Banks (#11)"],[1,"Dreadnought's her name.    You may talk o' your fliers--Swallow-tail and Black Ball--    But the Dreadnought's the packet that can beat them all.      \"Now the Dreadnought she lies in the River Mersey,    Because of the tugboat to take her to sea;    But when she's off soundings you shortly will know    (Chorus.)    She's the Liverpool packet--O Lord, let her go!      \"Now the Dreadnought she's howlin' 'crost the Banks o' Newfoundland,    Where the water's all shallow and the bottom's all sand.    Sez all the little fishes that swim to an' fro:    (Chorus.)    'She's the Liverpool packet--O Lord, let her go!'\"    There were scores of verses, for he worked the Dreadnought every mile  of the way between Liverpool and New York as conscientiously as though  he were on her deck, and the accordion pumped and the fiddle squeaked  beside him. Tom Platt followed with something about \"the rough and  tough McGinn, who would pilot the vessel in.\" Then they called on  Harvey, who felt very flattered, to contribute to the entertainment;  but all that he could remember were some pieces of \"Skipper Ireson's  Ride\" that he had been taught at the camp-school in the Adirondacks. It  seemed that they might be appropriate to the time and place, but he had  no more than mentioned the title when Disko brought down one foot with  a bang, and cried, \"Don't go on, young feller. That's a mistaken  jedgment--one o' the worst kind, too, becaze it's catchin' to the ear.\"    \"I orter ha' warned you,\" said Dan. \"Thet allus fetches dad.\"    \"What's wrong?\" said Harvey, surprised and a little angry.    \"All you're goin' to say,\" said Disko. \"All dead wrong from start to  finish, an' Whittier he's to blame. I have no special call to right any  Marblehead man, but 'tweren't no fault o' Ireson's. My father he told  me the tale time an' again, an' this is the way 'twuz.\"    \"For the wan hundreth time,\" put in Long Jack, under his breath.    \"Ben Ireson he was skipper o' the Betty, young feller, comin' home frum  the Banks--that was before the war of 1812, but jestice is jestice at  all times. They f'und the Active o' Portland, an' Gibbons o' that town  he was her skipper; they f'und her leakin' off Cape Cod Light. There  was a terr'ble gale on, an' they was gettin' the Betty home's fast as  they could craowd her. Well, Ireson he said there warn't any sense to  reskin' a boat in that sea; the men they wouldn't hev it; and he laid  it before them to stay by the Active till the sea run daown a piece.  They wouldn't hev that either, hangin' araound the Cape in any sech  weather, leak or no leak. They jest up stays'l an' quit, nat'rally  takin' Ireson with 'em. Folks to Marblehead was mad at him not runnin'  the risk, and becaze nex' day, when the sea was ca'am (they never  stopped to think o' that), some of the Active's folk was took off by a  Truro man. They come into Marblehead with their own tale to tell,  sayin' how Ireson had shamed his town, an' so forth an' so on; an'  Ireson's men they was scared, seem' public feelin' ag'in' 'em, an' they  went back on Ireson, an' swore he was respons'ble for the hull act.  'Tweren't the women neither that tarred and feathered him--Marblehead  women don't act that way--'twas a passel o' men an' boys, an' they  carted him araound town in an old dory till the bottom fell aout, an'  Ireson he told 'em they'd be sorry for it some day. Well, the facts  came aout later, same's they usually do, too late to be any ways useful  to an honest man; an' Whittier he come along an' picked up the slack  eend of a lyin' tale, an' tarred and feathered Ben Ireson all over onct  more after he was dead. 'Twas the only time Whittier ever slipped up,  an' 'tweren't fair. I whaled Dan good when he brought that piece back  from school. You don't know no better, o' course; but I've give you  the facts, hereafter an' evermore to be remembered. Ben Ireson weren't  no sech kind o' man as Whittier makes aout; my father he knew him well,  before an' after that business, an' you beware o' hasty jedgments,  young feller. Next!\"    Harvey had never heard Disko talk so long, and collapsed with burning  cheeks; but, as Dan said promptly, a boy could only learn what he was  taught at school, and life was too short to keep track of every lie  along the coast.    Then Manuel touched the jangling, jarring little _machette_ to a queer  tune, and sang something in Portuguese about \"Nina, innocente!\" ending  with a full-handed sweep that brought the song up with a jerk. Then  Disko obliged with his second song, to an old-fashioned creaky tune,  and all joined in the chorus. This is one stanza:      \"Now Aprile is over and melted the snow,    And outer Noo Bedford we shortly must tow;    Yes, out o' Noo Bedford we shortly must clear,    We're the whalers that never see wheat in the ear.\"    Here the fiddle went very softly for a while by itself, and then:      \"Wheat-in-the-ear, my true-love's posy blowin';    Wheat-in-the-ear, we're goin' off to sea;    Wheat-in-the-ear, I left you fit for sowin';    When I come back a loaf o' bread you'll be!\"    That made Harvey almost weep, though he could not tell why. But it was  much worse when the cook dropped the potatoes and held out his hands  for the fiddle. Still leaning against the locker door, he struck into a  tune that was like something very bad but sure to happen whatever you  did. After a little he sang in an unknown tongue, his big chin down on  the fiddle-tail, his white eyeballs glaring in the lamplight. Harvey  swung out of his bunk to hear better; and amid the straining of the  timbers and the wash of the waters the tune crooned and moaned on, like  lee surf in a blind fog, till it ended with a wail.    \"Jimmy Christmas! Thet gives me the blue creevles,\" said Dan.    \"What in thunder is it?\"    \"The song of Fin McCoul,\" said the cook, \"when he wass going to  Norway.\" His English was not thick, but all clear-cut, as though it  came from a phonograph.    \"Faith, I've been to Norway, but I didn't make that unwholesim noise.  'Tis like some of the old songs, though,\" said Long Jack, sighing.    \"Don't let's hev another 'thout somethin' between,\" said Dan; and the  accordion struck up a rattling, catchy tune that ended:      \"It's six an' twenty Sundays sence las' we saw the land,    With fifteen hunder quintal,    An' fifteen hunder quintal, 'Teen hunder toppin' quintal,    'Twix' old 'Queereau an' Grand!\"    \"Hold on!\" roared Tom Plait \"D'ye want to nail the trip, Dan? That's  Jonah sure, 'less you sing it after all our salt's wet.\"    \"No, 'tain't. Is it, dad? Not unless you sing the very las' verse. You  can't learn me anything on Jonahs!\"    \"What's that?\" said Harvey. \"What's a Jonah?\"    \"A Jonah's anything that spoils the luck. Sometimes it's a  man--sometimes it's a boy--or a bucket. I've known a splittin'-knife  Jonah two trips till we was on to her,\" said Tom Plait. \"There's all  sorts o' Jonahs. Jim Bourke was one till he was drowned on Georges. I'd  never ship with Jim Bourke, not if I was starvin'. There wuz a green  dory on the Ezra Flood. Thet was a Jonah too, the worst sort o' Jonah.  Drowned four men she did, an' used to shine fiery o' nights in the  nest.\"    \"And you believe that?\" said Harvey, remembering what Tom Platt had  said about candles and models. \"Haven't we all got to take what's  served?\"    A mutter of dissent ran round the bunks. \"Outboard, yes; inboard,  things can happen,\" said Disko. \"Don't you go makin' a mock of Jonahs,  young feller.\"    \"Well, Harve ain't no Jonah. Day after we catched him,\" Dan cut in, \"we  had a toppin' good catch.\"    The cook threw up his head and laughed suddenly--a queer, thin laugh.  He was a most disconcerting nigger. \"Murder!\" said Long Jack. \"Don't do  that again, doctor. We ain't used to Ut.\"    \"What's wrong?\" said Dan. \"Ain't he our mascot, and didn't they strike  on good after we'd struck him?\"    \"Oh! yess,\" said the cook. \"I know that, but the catch iss not finish  yet.\"    \"He ain't goin' to do us any harm,\" said Dan, hotly. \"Where are ye  hintin' an' edgin' to? He's all right.\"    \"No harm. No. But one day he will be your master, Danny.\"    \"That all?\" said Dan, placidly. \"He wun't--not by a jugful.\"    \"Master!\" said the cook, pointing to Harvey. \"Man!\" and he pointed to  Dan.    \"That's news. Haow soon?\" said Dan, with a laugh.    \"In some years, and I shall see it. Master and man--man and master.\"    \"How in thunder d'ye work that out?\" said Tom Platt.    \"In my head, where I can see.\"    \"Haow?\" This from all the others at once.    \"I do not know, but so it will be.\" He dropped his head, and went on  peeling the potatoes, and not another word could they get out of him.    \"Well,\" said Dan, \"a heap o' things'll hev to come abaout 'fore Harve's  any master o' mine; but I'm glad the doctor ain't choosen to mark him  for a Jonah. Now, I mistrust Uncle Salters fer the Jonerest Jonah in  the fleet regardin' his own special luck. Dunno ef it's spreadin'  same's smallpox. He ought to be on the Carrie Pitman. That boat's her  own Jonah, sure--crews an' gear make no differ to her driftin'. Jimmy  Christmas! She'll etch loose in a flat ca'am.\"    \"We're well dear o' the fleet, anyway,\" said Disko, \"Carrie Pitman an'  all.\" There was a rapping on the deck.    \"Uncle Salters has catched his luck,\" said Dan, as his father departed.    \"It's blown clear,\" Disko cried, and all the fo'c'sle tumbled up for a  bit of fresh air. The fog had gone, but a sullen sea ran in great  rollers behind it. The \"We're Here\" slid, as it were, into long, sunk  avenues and ditches which felt quite sheltered and homelike if they  would only stay still; but they changed without rest or mercy, and  flung up the schooner to crown one peak of a thousand grey hills, while  the wind hooted through her rigging as she zigzagged down the slopes.  Far away a sea would burst in a sheet of foam, and the others would  follow suit as at a signal, till Harvey's eyes"]]]
