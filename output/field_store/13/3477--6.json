Behind the  hills were little huts and hiding-places contrived within the shadow of  the low, thick trees that grow there, so that not a soul lived out of  cover. Captain Austin, R.A., who shared the humidity of my truck, and  who had been in charge of a 6-inch field-gun trained on Magersfontein at  eight thousand yards, told me that he could see through his glasses the  whole working of the enemy's admirable system. They had a look-out man  sitting at the far end of a long tunnel of rock and stone; when we fired  he gave the signal, and the Boers got into cover; and twenty seconds  afterwards, when our shell, beautifully aimed and timed, arrived on the  hill, it spent itself upon the flinty rock. Then the Boers showed their  heads and fired; and their shell swept through its arc and exploded,  generally finding its mark.    The battle of Magersfontein has been the subject of more prolonged  discussion than any other single event in the war. Coming on the day  after our reverse at Stormberg, it completed the momentary  demoralisation of a great mass of people at home who had expected the  campaign to resolve itself into a sweeping march on Pretoria. Like the  affair of Majuba, it has been sentimentally magnified out of all  proportion to its military importance. On the strength of the emotions  roused by our disaster, thousands graduated as military critics and  cried aloud for the recall of Lord Methuen. Private soldiers with  shattered nerves wrote home hysterical narratives and criticisms which  were published and commented upon, and treated as valuable evidence. We  lost our heads for the moment; there is no doubt of that; but people who  are thus betrayed into panic will not be appeased until they have made a  scapegoat of someone. Lord Methuen was, of course, the obvious  sacrifice. Why did he make a frontal attack? Why did he fail?    It is well to remember that Lord Methuen was being pressed to relieve  Kimberley, which represented its case as extreme. He must do something.  Naturally he designed the kind of attack which the forces at his  disposal were best suited to deliver. A long turning movement was out of  the question since he had not the mounted men for it. As for the  \"frontal attack\" at Magersfontein, of which we have heard so much, Lord  Methuen never designed and did not deliver a direct frontal attack. His  plan was to surprise the extreme left of Cronje's position, and at the  same time contain the whole of his front with a strong force. And no  competent critic has ventured to suggest any better disposal of the  forces then available for the purposes of attack. No, Lord Methuen has  not been criticised and abused because he used his force in one way  rather than in another, but simply because he failed.    There is very often more to be learned from a failure than a success,  and this particular failure is worthy of a little study. Everyone knows  that the reason why the attack on Magersfontein failed was, first,  because the Highland Brigade lost its way and came unexpectedly into  contact with the enemy's position, and, secondly, because they failed to  rally after the first confusion, when (in the opinion of many experts  who were present) a little confidence would probably have saved the day.  If any single precaution was neglected, if any pains were spared in the  reconnoitring of the position or in securing the proper conduct of the  troops towards the place from which their attack was to be delivered,  then Lord Methuen was absolutely to blame. But the more that is known  about this unfortunate affair the more clearly it will be seen that Lord  Methuen neglected no precaution and spared no pains. The rain and pitch  darkness were the act of God, and no general in the world can prevail  when Nature is so completely in league with the enemy as she was on the  night of Magersfontein.    I do not care to dwell on the malice and cruel unfairness of many of the  attacks on Lord Methuen, because, for my country's sake, I hope they  will soon be forgotten; but if anyone should still suppose that these  great hysterical waves of public feeling select their victims  impartially, I would ask him to compare the battle of Magersfontein  with the fruitless attack delivered by Lord Kitchener on the Paardeberg  laager on February 18th. In one case time was working against Lord  Methuen, and threatening to exhaust the endurance of Kimberley; in the  other case time was working with Lord Kitchener, limiting the resistance  of Cronje to a calculable number of days and hours. In one case there  was a small force which, owing to the nature of its composition, could  only be used in one way; in the other case there was a large and  splendidly-assorted force, which gave opportunity for an infinite  variety of combinations. In one case the attack was turned by  circumstances which no human being could have prevented into a frontal  contact; in the other case that form of attack was deliberately chosen.  In one case the casualties were about nine hundred; in the other, about  sixteen hundred. And in one case the general officer commanding has been  insulted and attacked and defamed, while the officer responsible for the  second affair is still regarded by the masses as a consummate master of  field operations.    This is a long digression; I have made it here because the subject of  it is inseparable from my memory of the dark and stony ranges which I  saw closely for the first time through the pitiless rain of that  February day. Miserable as the journey was, its passage through the  country occupied so lately by the enemy made it interesting. The way in  which our sappers had toiled to repair the line was beyond praise. Every  telegraph post had been blasted in two pieces by dynamite; every culvert  had been blown up; nearly every insulator smashed; the wires (about  seven in number) had been cut every few hundred yards; yet within four  days from the relief of Kimberley trains had begun to go up the whole  distance and telegraphic communication had been restored. I saw the work  that had been done, and the difficulty of it, and was proud of the way  in which it was accomplished. Not that there is little to be proud of in  the work of the army. On the contrary, one is amazed to see what is  accomplished in spite of the system, amazed to find what can be done by  able men against the most determined opposition from their own side; but  the great fact that was brought out by the earlier part of this campaign  is that the man of intelligence and initiative and ability and energy  was fast in the clutches of the Red Tape spider, which fussed round him  until he was enveloped in the scarlet web and impotent to use brains or  energy. Engineering is one of the few things of which corporate bodies  admit their ignorance; therefore the sappers got through much admirable  work quietly and quickly.    The approach to Kimberley with its mine shafts and hills of blue dust  reminded me of the Black Country. What one noticed first with regard to  the town was the number of holes and shelters and warrens into which  people had crept for safety. Hundreds of them, like human anthills; and  one thought, What strange place is this, where men fear to walk upright?  The menu at the principal hotel, where I dined, would (if it had been  printed) have consisted of one item--horseflesh. I noticed that the  residents ate it eagerly, and even talked about it; but most of us  strangers arose hungry and went quickly into the fresh air.    That night and the next morning I walked through the town and talked to  people who had been living there; and it was when I talked to the people  that I began to realise what had been happening. The few ruined  buildings and riddled walls conveyed little to me. But when one found  man after man thin, listless, and (in spite of the joy of salvation)  dispirited; talking with a tired voice and hopeless air, and with a  queer, shifty, nervous, scared look in the eye, one began to understand.    The thing was scarcely human, scarcely of this world. These men were not  like oneself. If you threaten an inexperienced boxer with a quick play  of fists on every side of his head, even though you never touch him, you  may completely demoralise him; he shies at every feint and every  movement. And these people had been in a situation comparable with that  of the poor boxer. Think of it. The signal from the conning tower, the  clamour of bells and whistles, the sudden silence amongst the people,  the rush for shelter, and then the hum and roar, like wind in a chimney,  of the huge iron cylinder flying through the air, potent for death. And  then, perhaps, the noise of a falling building, or the scream of some  human creature who is nothing but a mass of offence when you come up  five seconds later. Think of this repeated six or seven--sometimes sixty  or seventy--times during the daylight hours, and can you wonder that men  should lose their placid manners and scuttle like rats into their holes  at the dreaded sound? And all this fear and horror to be borne upon an  empty stomach, for the horrors of partial starvation were added to the  constant fear of a violent death. Mothers had to see their babies die  because there was no milk or other suitable nourishment; a baby cannot  live on horse and mule flesh. There was hardly a coloured baby left  alive; and that one statement accounts for whole lifetimes of misery and  suffering.    It was not until the Boers had mounted their 6-inch gun on the 8th of  February that the panic began. People had got used to the smaller  shells, which could often be dodged; besides, the enemy did not fire so  many of them. But when the big gun began its seventy rounds a day people  lost their self-command and began to dig and scratch in the earth for  shelter.

Its branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth,[FN#30]    Even as the deeds of men, which take their birth      From qualities: its silver sprays and blooms,    And all the eager verdure of its girth,    Leap to quick life at kiss of sun and air,    As men's lives quicken to the temptings fair      Of wooing sense: its hanging rootlets seek    The soil beneath, helping to hold it there,      As actions wrought amid this world of men    Bind them by ever-tightening bonds again.      If ye knew well the teaching of the Tree,    What its shape saith; and whence it springs; and, then      How it must end, and all the ills of it,    The axe of sharp Detachment ye would whet,      And cleave the clinging snaky roots, and lay    This Aswattha of sense-life low,--to set      New growths upspringing to that happier sky,--    Which they who reach shall have no day to die,      Nor fade away, nor fall--to Him, I mean,    FATHER and FIRST, Who made the mystery      Of old Creation; for to Him come they    From passion and from dreams who break away;      Who part the bonds constraining them to flesh,    And,--Him, the Highest, worshipping alway--      No longer grow at mercy of what breeze    Of summer pleasure stirs the sleeping trees,      What blast of tempest tears them, bough and stem    To the eternal world pass such as these!      Another Sun gleams there! another Moon!    Another Light,--not Dusk, nor Dawn, nor Noon--      Which they who once behold return no more;    They have attained My rest, life's Utmost boon!      When, in this world of manifested life,    The undying Spirit, setting forth from Me,    Taketh on form, it draweth to itself    From Being's storehouse,--which containeth all,--    Senses and intellect. The Sovereign Soul    Thus entering the flesh, or quitting it,    Gathers these up, as the wind gathers scents,    Blowing above the flower-beds. Ear and Eye,    And Touch and Taste, and Smelling, these it takes,--    Yea, and a sentient mind;--linking itself    To sense-things so.      The unenlightened ones    Mark not that Spirit when he goes or comes,    Nor when he takes his pleasure in the form,    Conjoined with qualities; but those see plain    Who have the eyes to see. Holy souls see    Which strive thereto. Enlightened, they perceive    That Spirit in themselves; but foolish ones,    Even though they strive, discern not, having hearts    Unkindled, ill-informed!      Know, too, from Me    Shineth the gathered glory of the suns    Which lighten all the world: from Me the moons    Draw silvery beams, and fire fierce loveliness.    I penetrate the clay, and lend all shapes    Their living force; I glide into the plant--    Root, leaf, and bloom--to make the woodlands green    With springing sap. Becoming vital warmth,    I glow in glad, respiring frames, and pass,    With outward and with inward breath, to feed    The body by all meats.[FN#31]      For in this world    Being is twofold: the Divided, one;    The Undivided, one. All things that live    Are \"the Divided.\" That which sits apart,    \"The Undivided.\"      Higher still is He,    The Highest, holding all, whose Name is LORD,    The Eternal, Sovereign, First! Who fills all worlds,    Sustaining them. And--dwelling thus beyond    Divided Being and Undivided--I    Am called of men and Vedas, Life Supreme,    The PURUSHOTTAMA.      Who knows Me thus,    With mind unclouded, knoweth all, dear Prince!    And with his whole soul ever worshippeth Me.        Now is the sacred, secret Mystery    Declared to thee! Who comprehendeth this    Hath wisdom! He is quit of works in bliss!      HERE ENDS CHAPTER XV. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA    Entitled \"Purushottamapraptiyog,\"    Or \"The Book of Religion by attaining the Supreme.\"            CHAPTER XVI        Krishna.    Fearlessness, singleness of soul, the will    Always to strive for wisdom; opened hand    And governed appetites; and piety,    And love of lonely study; humbleness,    Uprightness, heed to injure nought which lives,    Truthfulness, slowness unto wrath, a mind    That lightly letteth go what others prize;    And equanimity, and charity    Which spieth no man's faults; and tenderness    Towards all that suffer; a contented heart,    Fluttered by no desires; a bearing mild,    Modest, and grave, with manhood nobly mixed,    With patience, fortitude, and purity;    An unrevengeful spirit, never given    To rate itself too high;--such be the signs,    O Indian Prince! of him whose feet are set    On that fair path which leads to heavenly birth!      Deceitfulness, and arrogance, and pride,    Quickness to anger, harsh and evil speech,    And ignorance, to its own darkness blind,--    These be the signs, My Prince! of him whose birth    Is fated for the regions of the vile.[FN#32]      The Heavenly Birth brings to deliverance,    So should'st thou know! The birth with Asuras    Brings into bondage. Be thou joyous, Prince!    Whose lot is set apart for heavenly Birth.      Two stamps there are marked on all living men,    Divine and Undivine; I spake to thee    By what marks thou shouldst know the Heavenly Man,    Hear from me now of the Unheavenly!      They comprehend not, the Unheavenly,    How Souls go forth from Me; nor how they come    Back unto Me: nor is there Truth in these,    Nor purity, nor rule of Life. \"This world    Hath not a Law, nor Order, nor a Lord,\"    So say they: \"nor hath risen up by Cause    Following on Cause, in perfect purposing,    But is none other than a House of Lust.\"    And, this thing thinking, all those ruined ones--    Of little wit, dark-minded--give themselves    To evil deeds, the curses of their kind.    Surrendered to desires insatiable,    Full of deceitfulness, folly, and pride,    In blindness cleaving to their errors, caught    Into the sinful course, they trust this lie    As it were true--this lie which leads to death--    Finding in Pleasure all the good which is,    And crying \"Here it finisheth!\"      Ensnared    In nooses of a hundred idle hopes,    Slaves to their passion and their wrath, they buy    Wealth with base deeds, to glut hot appetites;    \"Thus much, to-day,\" they say, \"we gained! thereby    Such and such wish of heart shall have its fill;    And this is ours! and th' other shall be ours!    To-day we slew a foe, and we will slay    Our other enemy to-morrow! Look!    Are we not lords? Make we not goodly cheer?    Is not our fortune famous, brave, and great?    Rich are we, proudly born! What other men    Live like to us? Kill, then, for sacrifice!    Cast largesse, and be merry!\" So they speak    Darkened by ignorance; and so they fall--    Tossed to and fro with projects, tricked, and bound    In net of black delusion, lost in lusts--    Down to foul Naraka. Conceited, fond,    Stubborn and proud, dead-drunken with the wine    Of wealth, and reckless, all their offerings    Have but a show of reverence, being not made    In piety of ancient faith. Thus vowed    To self-hood, force, insolence, feasting, wrath,    These My blasphemers, in the forms they wear    And in the forms they breed, my foemen are,    Hateful and hating; cruel, evil, vile,    Lowest and least of men, whom I cast down    Again, and yet again, at end of lives,    Into some devilish womb, whence--birth by birth--    The devilish wombs re-spawn them, all beguiled;    And, till they find and worship Me, sweet Prince!    Tread they that Nether Road.      The Doors of Hell    Are threefold, whereby men to ruin pass,--    The door of Lust, the door of Wrath, the door    Of Avarice. Let a man shun those three!    He who shall turn aside from entering    All those three gates of Narak, wendeth straight    To find his peace, and comes to Swarga's gate.      .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .[FN#33]      HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XVI. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled  \"Daivasarasaupadwibhagayog,\"    Or \"The Book of the Separateness of the Divine and Undivine.\"            CHAPTER XVII        Arjuna.    If men forsake the holy ordinance,    Heedless of Shastras, yet keep faith at heart    And worship, what shall be the state of those,    Great Krishna! Sattwan, Rajas, Tamas? Say!      Krishna.    Threefold the faith is of mankind and springs    From those three qualities,--becoming \"true,\"    Or \"passion-stained,\" or \"dark,\" as thou shalt hear!      The faith of each believer, Indian Prince!    Conforms itself to what he truly is.    Where thou shalt see a worshipper, that one    To what he worships lives  assimilate,    [Such as the shrine, so is the votary,]    The \"soothfast\" souls adore true gods; the souls    Obeying Rajas worship Rakshasas[FN#34]    Or Yakshas; and the men of Darkness pray    To Pretas and to Bhutas.[FN#35] Yea, and those    Who  practise bitter penance, not enjoined    By rightful rule--penance which hath its root    In self-sufficient, proud hypocrisies--    Those men, passion-beset, violent, wild,    Torturing--the witless ones--My elements    Shut in fair company within their flesh,    (Nay, Me myself, present within the flesh!)    Know them to devils devoted, not to Heaven!    For like as foods are threefold for mankind    In nourishing, so is there threefold way    Of worship, abstinence, and almsgiving!    Hear this of Me! there is a food which brings    Force, substance, strength, and health, and joy to live,    Being well-seasoned, cordial, comforting,    The \"Soothfast\" meat. And there be foods which bring    Aches and unrests, and burning blood, and grief,    Being too biting, heating, salt, and sharp,    And therefore craved by too strong appetite.    And there is foul food--kept from over-night,[FN#36]    Savourless, filthy, which the foul will eat,    A feast of rottenness, meet for the lips    Of such as love the \"Darkness.\"      Thus with rites;--    A sacrifice not for rewardment made,    Offered in rightful wise, when he who vows    Sayeth, with heart devout, \"This I should do!\"    Is \"Soothfast"]]]
