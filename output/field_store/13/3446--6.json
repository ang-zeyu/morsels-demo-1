Then last of all, put them all in a great charger, the chickens or  fowls in the middle, then lay a lay of sweetbreads, then a lay of  bottoms of artichocks, and the marrow; on them some preserved  oranges.    Then next some hard eggs round that, fried sparagus, yolks of eggs,  chesnuts, and pistaches, then your green quodlings stuffed: the  charger being full, put to them marrow all over the meat, and juyce  of orange, and make a sauce of strained almonds, grapes, and  verjuyce; and being a little stewed in the oven, dry it, _&c._        The dish.      _Sweetbreads, Lambstones, Chickens, Marrow, Almonds, Eggs,    Oranges, Bisket, Sparagus, Artichocks, Musk, Saffron, Butter,    Potato's, Pistaches, Chesnuts, Verjuyce, Sugar, Flower,    Parmisan, Cinamon._        _To force a French Bread called Pine-molet, or three of them._    Take a manchet, and make a hole in the top of it, take out the crum,  and make a composition of the brawn of a capon rost or boil'd; mince  it, and stamp it in a mortar, with marchpane past, cream, yolks of  hard eggs, muskefied bisket bread, the crum of very fine manchet,  sugar, marrow, musk, and some sweet herbs chopped small, beaten  cinamon, saffron, some raw yolks of eggs, and currans: fill the  bread, and boil them in napkins in capon broth, but first stop the  top with the pieces you took off. Then stew or fry some sweetbreads  of veal and forced chickens between two dishes, or Lamb-stones,  fried with some mace, marrow, and grapes, sparagus, or artichocks,  and skirrets, the manchets being well boil'd, and your chickens  finely stewed, serve them in a fine dish, the manchets in the  middle, and the sweetbreads, chickens, and carved sippets round  about the dish; being finely dished, thicken the chicken broth with  strained almonds, creams, sugar, and beaten butter.    Garnish your dish with marrow, pistaches, artichocks, puff paste,  mace, dates, pomegranats, or barberries, and slic't lemon.        _Another forc't dish._    Take two pound of beef-marrow, and cut it as big as great dice, and  a pound of Dates, cut as big as small Dice; then have a pound of  prunes, and take away the out-side from the stones with your knife,  and a pound of Currans, and put these aforesaid in a Platter, twenty  yolks of eggs, and a pound of sugar, an ounce of cinamon, and mingle  all together.    Then have the yolks of twenty eggs more, strain them with  Rose-water, a little musk and sugar, fry them in two pancakes with a  little sweet butter fine and yellow, and being fried, put one of  them in a fair dish, and lay the former materials on it spread all  over; then take the other, and cut it in long slices as broad as  your little finger, and lay it over the dishes like a lattice  window, set it in the Oven, and bake it a little, then fry it, _&c._  Bake it leisurely.        _Another forc't fryed Dish._    Make a little past with yolks of eggs, flower, and boiling liquor.    Then take a quarter of a pound of sugar, a pound of marrow, half an  ounce of cinamon, and a little ginger. Then have some yolks of Eggs,  and mash your marrow, and a little Rose-water, musk or amber, and a  few currans or none, with a little suet, and make little pasties,  fry them with clarified butter, and serve them with scraped sugar,  and juyce of orange.        _Otherways._    Take good fresh water Eels, flay and mince them small with a warden  or two, and season it with pepper, cloves, mace, saffron: then put  currans, dates, and prunes, small minced amongst, and a little  verjuyce, and fry it in little pasties; bake it in the oven, or stew  it in a pan in past of divers forms, or pasties or stars, _&c._            To make any kind of sausages.        _First, Bolonia Sausages._    The best way and time of the year is to make them in _September_.    Take four stone of pork, of the legs the leanest, and take away all  the skins, sinews, and fat from it; mince it fine and stamp it: then  add to it three ounces of whole pepper, two ounces of pepper more  grosly cracked or beaten, whole cloves an ounce, nutmegs an ounce  finely beaten, salt, spanish, or peter-salt, an ounce of  coriander-seed finely beaten, or carraway-seed, cinamon an ounce  fine beaten, lard cut an inch long, as big as your little finger,  and clean without rust; mingle all the foresaid together; and fill  beef guts as full as you can possibly, and as the wind gathers in  the gut, prick them with a pin, and shake them well down with your  hands; for if they be not well filled, they will be rusty.    These aforesaid Bolonia Sausages are most excellent of pork only:  but some use buttock beef, with pork, half one and as much of the  other. Beef and pork are very good.    Some do use pork of a weeks powder for this use beforesaid, and no  more salt at all.    Some put a little sack in the beating of these sausages, and put in  place of coriander-seed, carraway-seed.    This is the most excellent way to make Bolonia Sausages, being  carefully filled, and tied fast with a packthred, and smoaked or  smothered three or four days, that will turn them red; then hang  them in some cool cellar or higher room to take the air.        _Other Sausages._    Sausages of pork with some of the fat of a chine of bacon or pork,  some sage chopped fine and small, salt, and pepper: and fill them  into porkets guts, or hogs, or sheeps guts, or no guts, and let them  dry in the chimney leisurely, _&c._        _Otherways._    Mince pork with beef-suet, and mince some sage, and put to it some  pepper, salt, cloves, and mace; make it into balls, and keep it for  your use, or roll them into little sausages some four or five inches  long as big as your finger; fry six or seven of them, and serve them  in a dish with vinegar or juyce of orange.    Thus you may do of a leg of veal, and put nothing but salt and suet;  and being fried, serve it with gravy and juyce of orange or butter  and vinegar; and before you fry them flower them. And thus mutton or  any meat.    Or you may add sweet Herbs or Nutmeg: and thus Mutton.        _Other Sausages._    Mince some Buttock-Beef with Beef suet, beat them well together, and  season it with cloves, mace, pepper, and salt: fill the guts, or fry  it as before; if in guts, boil them and serve them as puddings.        _Otherways for change._    If without guts, fry them and serve them with gravy, juyce of orange  or vinegar, _&c._        _To make Links._    Take the raring pieces of pork or hog bacon, or fillets, or legs,  cut the lean into bits as big as great dice square, and the fleak in  the same form, half as much; and season them with good store of  chopped sage chopt very small and fine; and season it also with some  pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace also very small beaten, and salt,  and fill porkets guts, or Beef-guts: being well filled, hang them up  and dry them till the salt shine through them; and when you will  spend them, boil them and broil them.            To make all manner of Hashes.        _First, of raw Beef._    Mince it very small with some Beef-suet or lard, some sweet herbs,  pepper, salt, some cloves, and mace, blanched chesnuts, or almonds  blanched, and put in whole, some nutmeg, and a whole onion or two,  and stew it finely in a pipkin with some strong broth the space of  two hours, put a little claret to it, and serve it on sippets finely  carved, with some grapes or lemon in it also, or barberries, and  blow off the fat.        _Otherways._    Stew it in Beef gobbets, and cut some fat and lean together as big  as a good pullets egg, and put them into a pot or pipkin with some  Carrots cut in pieces as big as a walnut, some whole onions, some  parsnips, large mace, faggot of sweet herbs, salt, pepper, cloves,  and as much water and wine as will cover them, and stew it the space  of three hours.        2. _Beef hashed otherways, of the Buttock._    Cut it into thin slices, and hack them with the back of your knife,  then fry them with sweet butter; and being fried put them in a  pipkin with some claret, strong broth, or gravy, cloves, mace,  pepper, salt, and sweet-butter; being tender stewed the space of an  hour, serve them on fine sippets, with slic't lemon, gooseberries,  barberries, or grapes, and some beaten butter.        3. _Beef hashed otherways._    Cut some buttock-beef into fine thin slices, and half as many slices  of fine interlarded Bacon, stew it very well and tender, with some  claret and strong Broth, cloves, mace, pepper, and salt; being  tender stewed the space of two hours, serve them on fine carved  sippets, _&c._        4. _A Hash of Bullocks Cheeks._    Take the flesh from the bones, then with a sharp knife slice them in  thin slices like Scotch collops, and fry them in sweet butter a  little; then put them into a Pipkin with gravy or strong broth and  claret, and salt, chopped sage, and nutmeg, stew them the space of  two hours, or till they be tender, then serve them on fine carved  sippets, _&c._        _Hashes of Neats Feet, or any Feet; as Calves, Sheeps, Dears,      Hogs, Lambs, Pigs, Fawns, or the like, many of the ways      following._    Boil them very tender, and being cold, mince them small, then put  currans to them, beaten cinamon, hard eggs minced, capers, sweet  herbs minced small, cloves, mace, sugar, white-wine, butter, slic't  lemon or orange, slic't almonds, grated bread, saffron, sugar,  gooseberries, barberries or grapes; and being finely stewed down,  serve them on fine carved sippets.        2. _Neats Feet hashed otherwise._    Cut them in peices, being tender boild, and put to them some chopped  onions, parsly, time butter, mace, pepper, vinegar, salt, and sugar:  being finely stewed serve them on fine carved sippets, barberries,  and sugar; sometimes thicken the broth with yolks of raw eggs and  verjuice, run it over with beaten butter, and sometimes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22799"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Ancient Egypt (#11)"],[1," it,  one fancies, if his sleep was to be broken so often. Perhaps there was  more danger of killing him with kindness and care, than if they had left  him more to himself; but Pepy's anxiety was very like a boy. However,  Herkhuf evidently succeeded in bringing his dwarf safe and sound to the  King's Court, and no doubt the quaint little savage proved a splendid  toy for the young King. One wonders what he thought of the great cities  and the magnificent Court of Egypt, and whether his heart did not weary  sometimes for the wild freedom of his lost home.    Herkhuf was so proud of the King's letter that he caused it to be  engraved, word for word, on the walls of the tomb which he hewed out for  himself at Elephantine, and there to this day the words can be read  which tell us how old is the story of African exploration, and how a boy  was always just a boy, even though he lived five thousand years ago, and  reigned over a great kingdom.          CHAPTER X    A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY      About 3,500 years ago, there reigned a great Queen in Egypt. It was not  usual for the Egyptian throne to be occupied by a woman, though great  respect was always shown to women in Egypt, and the rank of a King's  mother was considered quite as important as that of his father. But once  at least in her history Egypt had a great Queen, whose fame deserves to  be remembered, and who takes honourable rank among the great women, like  Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria, who have ruled kingdoms.    During part of her life Queen Hatshepsut was only joint sovereign along  with her husband, and in the latter part of her reign she was joint  sovereign with her half-brother or nephew, who succeeded her; but for at  least twenty years she was really the sole ruler of Egypt, and governed  the land wisely and well.    Perhaps the most interesting thing that happened in her reign was the  voyage of discovery which she caused to be made by some ships of her  fleet. Centuries before her time, when the world was young, the  Egyptians had made expeditions down the Red Sea to a land which they  sometimes called Punt, and sometimes \"The Divine Land.\" Probably it was  part of the country that we now know as Somaliland. But for a very long  time these voyages had ceased, and people only knew by hearsay, and by  the stories of ancient days, of this wonderful country that lay away by  the Southern Sea.    One day, the Queen tells us, she was at prayers in the temple of the god  Amen at Thebes, when she felt a sudden inspiration. The god was giving  her a command to send an expedition to this almost forgotten land. \"A  command was heard in the sanctuary, a behest of the god himself, that  the ways which lead to Punt should be explored, and that the roads to  the Ladders of Incense should be trodden.\" In obedience to this command,  the Queen at once equipped a little fleet of the quaint old galleys that  the Egyptians then used (Plate 1), and sent them out, with picked crews,  and a royal envoy in command, to sail down the Red Sea, in search of the  Divine Land. The ships were laden with all kinds of goods to barter with  the Punites, and a guard of Egyptian soldiers was placed on board.    We do not know how long it took the little squadron to reach its  destination. Sea voyages in those days were slow and dangerous. But at  last the ships safely reached the mouth of the Elephant River in  Somaliland, and went up the river with the tide till they came to the  village of the natives. They found that the Punites lived in curious  beehive-shaped houses, some of them made of wicker-work, and placed on  piles, so that they had to climb into them by ladders. The men were not  negroes, though some negroes lived among them; they were very much like  the Egyptians in appearance, wore pointed beards, and were dressed only  in loincloths, while the women wore a yellow sleeveless dress, which  reached halfway between the knee and ankle.    Nehsi, the royal envoy, landed with an officer and eight soldiers, and,  to show that he came in peace, he spread out on a table some presents  for the chief of the Punites--five bracelets, two gold necklaces, a  dagger, with belt and sheath, a battle-axe, and eleven strings of glass  beads--much such a present as a European explorer might give to-day to  an African chief. The natives came down in great excitement to see the  strangers who had brought such treasures, and were astonished at the  arrival of such a fleet. \"How is it,\" they said, \"that you have reached  this country, hitherto unknown to men? Have you come by way of the sky,  or have you sailed on the waters of the Divine Sea?\" The chief, who was  called Parihu, came down with his wife Aty, and his daughter. Aty rode  down on a donkey, but dismounted to see the strangers, and, indeed, the  poor donkey must have been greatly relieved, for the chieftainess was an  exceedingly fat lady, and her daughter, though so young, showed every  intention of being as fat as her mother.    After the envoy and the chief had exchanged compliments, business began.  The Egyptians pitched a tent in which they stored their goods for  barter, and to put temptation out of the way of the natives, they drew a  guard of soldiers round the tent. For several days the market remained  open, and the country people brought down their treasures, till the  ships were laden as deeply as was safe. The cargo was a varied and  valuable one. Elephants' tusks, gold, ebony, apes, greyhounds, leopard  skins, all were crowded into the galleys, the apes sitting gravely on  the top of the bales of goods, and looking longingly at the land which  they were leaving.    But the most important part of the cargo was the incense, and the  incense-trees. Great quantities of the gum from which the incense was  made were placed on board, and also thirty-one of the incense sycamores,  their roots carefully surrounded with a large ball of earth, and  protected by baskets. Several young chiefs of the Punites accompanied  the expedition back to Thebes, to see what life was like in the strange  new world which had been revealed to them. Altogether the voyage home  must have been no easy undertaking, for the ships, with their heavy  cargoes, must have been very difficult to handle.    The arrival of the squadron at Thebes, which they must have reached by a  canal connecting the Nile with the Red Sea, was made the occasion of a  great holiday festival. Long lines of troops in gala attire came out to  meet the brave explorers, and an escort of the royal fleet accompanied  the exploring squadron up to the temple quay where the ships were to  moor. Then the Thebans feasted their eyes on the wonderful treasures  that had come from Punt, wondering at the natives, the incense, the  ivory, and, above all, at a giraffe which had been brought home. How the  poor creature was stowed away on the little Egyptian ship it is hard to  see; but there he was, with his spots and his long neck, the most  wonderful creature that the good folks of Thebes had ever seen. The  precious incense gum was stored in the temple, and the Queen herself  gave a bushel measure, made of a mixture of gold and silver, to measure  it out with.    So the voyage of discovery had ended in a great success. But Queen  Hatshepsut's purpose was only half fulfilled as yet. In a nook of the  limestone cliffs, not far from Thebes, her father before her had begun  to build a very wonderful temple, close beside the ruins of an older  sanctuary which had stood there for hundreds of years. Hatshepsut had  been gradually completing his work, and the temple was now growing into  a most beautiful building, very different from ordinary Egyptian  temples. From the desert sands in front it rose terrace above terrace,  each platform bordered with rows of beautiful limestone pillars, until  at last it reached the cliffs, and the most sacred chamber of it, the  Holy of Holies, was hewn into the solid wall of rock behind.    This temple the Queen resolved to make into what she called a Paradise  for Amen, the god who had told her to send out the ships. So she planted  on the terraces the sacred incense-trees which had been brought from  Punt; and, thanks to careful tending and watering, they flourished well  in their new home. And then, all along the walls of the temple, she  caused her artists to carve and paint the whole story of the voyage. We  do not know the names of the artists who did the work, though we know  that of the architect, Sen-mut, who planned the building. But, whoever  they were, they must have been very skilful sculptors; for the story of  the voyage is told in pictures on the walls of this wonderful temple, so  that everything can be seen just as it actually happened more than three  thousand years ago.    You can see the ships toiling along with oar and sail towards their  destination, the meeting with the natives, the palaver and the trading,  the loading of the galleys, and the long procession of Theban soldiers  going out to meet the returning explorers. Not a single detail is  missed, and, thanks to the Queen and her artists, we can go back over  all these years, and see how sailors worked, and how people lived in  savage lands in that far-off time, and realize that explorers dealt with  the natives in foreign countries in those days very much as they deal  with them now. When our explorers of to-day come back from their  journeys, they generally tell the story of their adventures in a big  book with many pictures; but no explorer ever published the account of a  voyage of discovery on such a scale as did Queen Hatshepsut, when she  carved the voyage to Punt on the walls of her great temple at  Deir-el-Bahri, and no pictures in any modern book are likely to last as  long, or to tell so much as these pictures that have come to light again  during the last few years, after being buried for centuries under the  desert sands.
