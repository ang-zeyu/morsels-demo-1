[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19284"],[0,"Paris Talks (#11)"],[1,"November 9th    In the Gospel according to St John, Christ has said: 'Except a man be born  of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.'(8)  The priests have interpreted this into meaning that baptism is necessary  for salvation. In another Gospel it is said: 'He shall baptize you with  the Holy Ghost and with fire'.(9)    Thus the water of baptism and the fire are one! It cannot mean that the  'water' spoken of is physical water, for it is the direct opposite of  'fire', and one destroys the other. When in the Gospels, Christ speaks of  'water', He means that which causes life, for without water no worldly  creature can live--mineral, vegetable, animal and man, one and all, depend  upon water for their very being. Yes, the latest scientific discoveries  prove to us that even mineral has some form of life, and that it also  needs water for its existence.    Water is the cause of life, and when Christ speaks of water, He is  symbolizing that which is the cause of Everlasting Life.    This life-giving water of which He speaks is like unto fire, for it is  none other than the Love of God, and this love means life to our souls.    By the fire of the Love of God the veil is burnt which separates us from  the Heavenly Realities, and with clear vision we are enabled to struggle  onward and upward, ever progressing in the paths of virtue and holiness,  and becoming the means of light to the world.    There is nothing greater or more blessed than the Love of God! It gives  healing to the sick, balm to the wounded, joy and consolation to the whole  world, and through it alone can man attain Life Everlasting. The essence  of all religions is the Love of God, and it is the foundation of all the  sacred teachings.    It was the Love of God that led Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that  strengthened Joseph in Egypt and gave to Moses courage and patience.    Through the Love of God, Christ was sent into the world with His inspiring  example of a perfect life of self-sacrifice and devotion, bringing to men  the message of Eternal Life. It was the Love of God that gave Muhammad  power to bring the Arabs from a state of animal degradation to a loftier  state of existence.    God's Love it was that sustained the Bab and brought him to his supreme  sacrifice, and made his bosom the willing target for a thousand bullets.    Finally, it was the Love of God that gave to the East Baha'u'llah, and is  now sending the light of His teaching far into the West, and from Pole to  Pole.    Thus I exhort each of you, realizing its power and beauty, to sacrifice  all your thoughts, words and actions to bring the knowledge of the Love of  God into every heart.          DISCOURSE AT 'L'ALLIANCE SPIRITUALISTE'      Salle de l'Athenee,  St Germain, Paris,  November 9th    I wish to express my gratitude for your hospitality, and my joy that you  are spiritually minded. I am happy to be present at a gathering such as  this, assembled together to listen to a Divine Message. If you could see  with the eye of truth, great waves of spirituality would be visible to you  in this place. The power of the Holy Spirit is here for all. Praise be to  God that your hearts are inspired with Divine fervour! Your souls are as  waves on the sea of the spirit; although each individual is a distinct  wave, the ocean is one, all are united in God.    Every heart should radiate unity, so that the Light of the one Divine  Source of all may shine forth bright and luminous. We must not consider  the separate waves alone, but the entire sea. We should rise from the  individual to the whole. The spirit is as one great ocean and the waves  thereof are the souls of men.    We are told in the Holy Scripture that the New Jerusalem shall appear on  earth. Now it is evident that this celestial city is not built of material  stones and mortar, but that it is a city not made with hands, eternal in  the Heavens.    This is a prophetic symbol, meaning the coming again of the Divine  Teaching to enlighten the hearts of men. It is long since this Holy  Guidance has governed the lives of humanity. But now, at last, the Holy  City of the New Jerusalem has come again to the world, it has appeared  anew under an Eastern sky; from the horizon of Persia has its effulgence  arisen to be a light to lighten the whole world. We see in these days the  fulfilment of the Divine Prophecy. Jerusalem had disappeared. The heavenly  city was destroyed, now it is rebuilt; it was razed to the ground, but now  its walls and pinnacles have been restored, and are towering aloft in  their renewed and glorious beauty.    In the Western world material prosperity has triumphed, whilst in the East  the spiritual sun has shone forth.    I am very glad to see such an assembly as this in Paris, where spiritual  and material progress are met together in unity.    Man--the true man--is soul, not body; though physically man belongs to the  animal kingdom, yet his soul lifts him above the rest of creation. Behold  how the light of the sun illuminates the world of matter: even so doth the  Divine Light shed its rays in the kingdom of the soul. The soul it is  which makes the human creature a celestial entity!    By the power of the Holy Spirit, working through his soul, man is able to  perceive the Divine reality of things. All great works of art and science  are witnesses to this power of the Spirit.    The same Spirit gives Eternal Life.    Those alone who are baptized by the Divine Spirit will be enabled to bring  all peoples into the bond of unity. It is by the power of the Spirit that  the Eastern World of spiritual thought can intermingle with the Western  realm of action, so that the world of matter may become Divine.    It follows that all who work for the Supreme Design are soldiers in the  army of the Spirit.    The light of the celestial world makes war against the world of shadow and  illusion. The rays of the Sun of Truth dispel the darkness of superstition  and misunderstanding.    You are of the Spirit! To you who seek the truth, the Revelation of  Baha'u'llah will come as a great joy! This teaching is of the Spirit, in  it is no precept which is not of the Divine Spirit.    Spirit cannot be perceived by the material senses of the physical body,  excepting as it is expressed in outward signs and works. The human body is  visible, the soul is invisible. It is the soul nevertheless that directs a  man's faculties, that governs his humanity.    The soul has two main faculties. (a) As outer circumstances are  communicated to the soul by the eyes, ears, and brain of a man, so does  the soul communicate its desires and purposes through the brain to the  hands and tongue of the physical body, thereby expressing itself. The  spirit in the soul is the very essence of life. (b) The second faculty of  the soul expresses itself in the world of vision, where the soul inhabited  by the spirit has its being, and functions without the help of the  material bodily senses. There, in the realm of vision, the soul sees  without the help of the physical eye, hears without the aid of the  physical ear, and travels without dependence upon physical motion. It is,  therefore, clear that the spirit in the soul of man can function through  the physical body by using the organs of the ordinary senses, and that it  is able also to live and act without their aid in the world of vision.  This proves without a doubt the superiority of the soul of man over his  body, the superiority of spirit over matter.    For example, look at this lamp: is not the light within it superior to the  lamp which holds it? However beautiful the form of the lamp may be, if the  light is not there its purpose is unfulfilled, it is without life--a dead  thing. The lamp needs the light, but the light does not need the lamp.    The spirit does not need a body, but the body needs spirit, or it cannot  live. The soul can live without a body, but the body without a soul dies.    If a man lose his sight, his hearing, his hand or his foot, should his  soul still inhabit the body he lives, and is able to manifest divine  virtues. On the other hand, without the spirit it would be impossible for  a perfect body to exist.    The greatest power of the Holy Spirit exists in the Divine Manifestations  of the Truth. Through the power of the Spirit the Heavenly Teaching has  been brought into the World of Humanity. Through the power of the Spirit  life everlasting has come to the children of men. Through the power of the  Spirit the Divine Glory has shone from East to West, and through the power  of the same Spirit will the divine virtues of humanity become manifest.    Our greatest efforts must be directed towards detachment from the things  of the world; we must strive to become more spiritual, more luminous, to  follow the counsel of the Divine Teaching, to serve the cause of unity and  true equality, to be merciful, to reflect the love of the Highest on all  men, so that the light of the Spirit shall be apparent in all our deeds,  to the end that all humanity shall be united, the stormy sea thereof  calmed, and all rough waves disappear from off the surface of life's ocean  henceforth unruffled and peaceful. Then will the New Jerusalem be seen by  mankind, who will enter through its gates and receive the Divine Bounty.    I thank God that I have been present amongst you this afternoon, and I  thank you for your spiritual feeling.    I pray that you may grow in Divine fervour, and that the power of unity in  the Spirit will augment, so that the prophecies may be fulfilled, and that  in this great century of the Light of God all the glad tidings written in  the Sacred Books may come to pass. This is the glorious time of which the  Lord Jesus Christ spoke when He told us to pray 'Thy Kingdom come, Thy  Will be done on earth as it is in Heaven'. I hope that this is also your  expectation and great desire.

We will pray that the ensign of international peace may be uplifted  and that the oneness of the world of humanity may be realized and  accomplished. All this is made possible and practicable through your  efforts. May this American democracy be the first nation to establish the  foundation of international agreement. May it be the first nation to  proclaim the universality of mankind. May it be the first to upraise the  standard of the Most Great Peace, and through this nation of democracy may  these philanthropic intentions and institutions be spread broadcast  throughout the world. Truly, this is a great and revered nation. Here  liberty has reached its highest degree. The intentions of its people are  most praiseworthy. They are, indeed, worthy of being the first to build  the Tabernacle of the Most Great Peace and proclaim the oneness of  mankind. I will supplicate God for assistance and confirmation in your  behalf.          21 April 1912  Talk at Studio Hall  1219 Connecticut Avenue, Washington, D.C.      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    I have come here to visit you. With the greatest longing I have wished to  see you. Realizing it was only with great difficulty that you could come  to me and that very few could make the trip, I decided to come to you so  that all might have the pleasure of meeting. Praise be to God! I am here,  and I am looking into your faces--faces radiant with inner beauty, hearts  attracted to the Kingdom of Abha, spirits exhilarated through the glad  tidings of God. Therefore, I have experienced the greatest possible  happiness. And surely this happiness must be mutual, for the hearts are  connected with each other and are filled with the same vibration. The  flame and the light of love are reflected in all. Spiritual  susceptibilities and heart longings fill every heart. If we should offer a  hundred thousand thanksgivings every moment to the threshold of God for  this love which has blended the Orient and Occident, we would fail to  express our gratitude sufficiently. If all the powers of earth should seek  to bring about this love between East and West, they would prove  incapable. If they wished to establish this unity, it would prove  impossible. But Baha'u'llah has accomplished both through the power of the  Holy Spirit, and this bond of unity through love is indissoluble. It shall  continue unto time everlasting, and day by day its power shall increase.  Erelong it shall enchain the world, and eventually the hearts of all the  nations of the world will be brought together by its constraining clasp.  The world of humanity shall become the manifestation of the lights of  Divinity, and the bestowals of God shall surround all. From the  standpoints of both material and spiritual civilization extraordinary  progress and development will be witnessed. In this present cycle there  will be an evolution in civilization unparalleled in the history of the  world. The world of humanity has, heretofore, been in the stage of  infancy; now it is approaching maturity. Just as the individual human  organism, having attained the period of maturity, reaches its fullest  degree of physical strength and ripened intellectual faculties so that in  one year of this ripened period there is witnessed an unprecedented  measure of development, likewise the world of humanity in this cycle of  its completeness and consummation will realize an immeasurable upward  progress, and that power of accomplishment whereof each individual human  reality is the depository of God--that outworking Universal Spirit--like the  intellectual faculty, will reveal itself in infinite degrees of  perfection.    Therefore, thank ye God that ye have come into the plane of existence in  this radiant century wherein the bestowals of God are appearing from all  directions, when the doors of the Kingdom have been opened unto you, the  call of God is being raised, and the virtues of the human world are in the  process of unfoldment. The day has come when all darkness is to be  dispelled, and the Sun of Truth shall shine forth radiantly. This time of  the world may be likened to the equinoctial in the annual cycle. For,  verily, this is the spring season of God. In the Holy Books a promise is  given that the springtime of God shall make itself manifest; Jerusalem,  the Holy City, shall descend from heaven; Zion shall leap forth and dance;  and the Holy Land shall be submerged in the ocean of divine effulgence.    At the time of the vernal equinox in the material world a wonderful  vibrant energy and new life-quickening is observed everywhere in the  vegetable kingdom; the animal and human kingdoms are resuscitated and move  forward with a new impulse. The whole world is born anew, resurrected.  Gentle zephyrs are set in motion, wafting and fragrant; flowers bloom; the  trees are in blossom, the air temperate and delightful; how pleasant and  beautiful become the mountains, fields and meadows. Likewise, the  spiritual bounty and springtime of God quicken the world of humanity with  a new animus and vivification. All the virtues which have been deposited  and potential in human hearts are being revealed from that Reality as  flowers and blossoms from divine gardens. It is a day of joy, a time of  happiness, a period of spiritual growth. I beg of God that this divine  spiritual civilization may have the fullest impression and effect upon  you. May you become as growing plants. May the trees of your hearts bring  forth new leaves and variegated blossoms. May ideal fruits appear from  them in order that the world of humanity, which has grown and developed in  material civilization, may be quickened in the bringing forth of spiritual  ideals. Just as human intellects have revealed the secrets of matter and  have brought forth from the realm of the invisible the mysteries of  nature, may minds and spirits, likewise, come into the knowledge of the  verities of God, and the realities of the Kingdom be made manifest in  human hearts. Then the world will be the paradise of Abha, the standard of  the Most Great Peace will be borne aloft, and the oneness of the world of  humanity in all its beauty, glory and significance will become apparent.  And now in your presence I wish to pray in your behalf. Let your hearts be  attentive and directed to the Kingdom of Abha.    Prayer in Persian    It is my hope that the supplication I have offered to the Kingdom of Abha  in your behalf may soon be answered and that its results and effects may  become manifest in your hearts and lives.          21 April 1912  Talk at Universalist Church  Thirteenth and L Streets, Washington, D.C.      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    The doctrines and creed of this church, so capably expressed by its  revered minister, are truly commendable, sanctified and worthy of praise  and glorification, for these precepts are opposed to the deep-rooted  religious prejudices of the day. It is evident that prejudices arising  from adherence to religious forms and imitation of ancestral beliefs have  hindered the progress of humanity thousands of years. How many wars and  battles have been fought, how much division, discord and hatred have been  caused by this form of prejudice! But inasmuch as this century is a  century of the revelation of reality--praise be to God!--the thoughts of men  are being directed toward the welfare and unity of humanity. Daily the  mirage of imitations is passing away, and the ocean of truth is surging  more tumultuously. All the existing nations had a divine foundation of  truth or reality originally, which was intended to be conducive to the  unity and accord of mankind, but the light of that reality gradually  became obscured. The darkness of superstitions and imitations came and  took its place, binding the world of humanity in the chains and fetters of  ignorance. Enmity arose among men, increasing to such an extent that  nation strove against nation in hatred and violence. War has been a  religious and political human heritage.    Now it is enough! We must investigate reality. We must put away these  superstitions. It is a self-evident truth that all humanity is the  creation of God. All are His servants and under His protection. All are  recipients of His bestowals. God is kind to all His servants. At most it  is this: that some are ignorant; they must be educated in order that they  may become intelligent. Some are immature as children; they must be aided  and assisted in order that they may become mature. Some are sick and  ailing; they must be healed. But the suffering patient must not be tested  by false treatment. The child must not be warped and hindered in its  development. The ignorant must not be restricted by censure and criticism.  We must look for the real, true remedy.    All the Prophets of God, including Jesus Christ, appeared in the world for  the education of humanity, to develop immature souls into maturity, to  transform the ignorant of mankind into the knowing, thereby establishing  love and unity through divine education and training. The Prophets have  not come to cause discord and enmity. For God has wished all good for His  servants, and he who wishes the servants of God evil is against God; he  has not obeyed the will and emulated the example of God; he has followed  Satanic leadings and footprints. The attributes of God are love and mercy;  the attribute of Satan is hate. Therefore, he who is merciful and kind to  his fellowmen is manifesting the divine attribute, and he who is hating  and hostile toward a fellow creature is satanic. God is absolute love,  even as Jesus Christ has declared, and Satan is utter hatred. Wherever  love is witnessed, know that there is a manifestation of God's mercy;  whenever you meet hatred and enmity, know that these are the evidences and  attributes of Satan. The Prophets have appeared in this world with the  mission that"]]]
