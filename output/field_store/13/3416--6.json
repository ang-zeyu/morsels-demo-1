And she had an  intuition that her best defence would be attack. Bluff was what was  needed. Wide-eyed, innocent wonder . . . After all, Percy couldn't  be certain he had seen her in Piccadilly.    \"All right.\"    \"By the way, dear old girl,\" inquired Reggie, \"did your little  business come out satisfactorily? I forgot to ask.\"    \"Not very. But it was awfully sweet of you to take me into town.\"    \"How would it be,\" said Reggie nervously, \"not to dwell too much on  that part of it? What I mean to say is, for heaven's sake don't let  the mater know I rallied round.\"    \"Don't worry,\" said Maud with a laugh. \"I'm not going to talk about  the thing at all.\"    Lord Belpher, meanwhile, in the library, had begun with the aid of  a whisky and soda to feel a little better. There was something  about the library with its sombre half tones that soothed his  bruised spirit. The room held something of the peace of a deserted  city. The world, with its violent adventures and tall policemen,  did not enter here. There was balm in those rows and rows of books  which nobody ever read, those vast writing tables at which nobody  ever wrote. From the broad mantel-piece the bust of some unnamed  ancient looked down almost sympathetically. Something remotely  resembling peace had begun to steal into Percy's soul, when it was  expelled by the abrupt opening of the door and the entry of Lady  Caroline Byng and his father. One glance at the face of the former  was enough to tell Lord Belpher that she knew all.    He rose defensively.    \"Let me explain.\"    Lady Caroline quivered with repressed emotion. This masterly woman  had not lost control of herself, but her aristocratic calm had  seldom been so severely tested. As Reggie had surmised, she had read  the report of the proceedings in the evening paper in the train, and  her world had been reeling ever since. Caesar, stabbed by Brutus,  could scarcely have experienced a greater shock. The other members  of her family had disappointed her often. She had become inured to  the spectacle of her brother working in the garden in corduroy  trousers and in other ways behaving in a manner beneath the dignity  of an Earl of Marshmoreton. She had resigned herself to the innate  flaw in the character of Maud which had allowed her to fall in love  with a nobody whom she had met without an introduction. Even Reggie  had exhibited at times democratic traits of which she thoroughly  disapproved. But of her nephew Percy she had always been sure. He  was solid rock. He, at least, she had always felt, would never do  anything to injure the family prestige. And now, so to speak, \"Lo,  Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.\" In other words, Percy was the  worst of the lot. Whatever indiscretions the rest had committed, at  least they had never got the family into the comic columns of the  evening papers. Lord Marshmoreton might wear corduroy trousers and  refuse to entertain the County at garden parties and go to bed with  a book when it was his duty to act as host at a formal ball; Maud  might give her heart to an impossible person whom nobody had ever  heard of; and Reggie might be seen at fashionable restaurants with  pugilists; but at any rate evening paper poets had never written  facetious verses about their exploits. This crowning degradation had  been reserved for the hitherto blameless Percy, who, of all the  young men of Lady Caroline's acquaintance, had till now appeared to  have the most scrupulous sense of his position, the most rigid  regard for the dignity of his great name. Yet, here he was, if the  carefully considered reports in the daily press were to be believed,  spending his time in the very spring-tide of his life running about  London like a frenzied Hottentot, brutally assaulting the police.  Lady Caroline felt as a bishop might feel if he suddenly discovered  that some favourite curate had gone over to the worship of Mumbo  Jumbo.    \"Explain?\" she cried. \"How can you explain? You--my nephew, the  heir to the title, behaving like a common rowdy in the streets of  London . . . your name in the papers . . . \"    \"If you knew the circumstances.\"    \"The circumstances? They are in the evening paper. They are in  print.\"    \"In verse,\" added Lord Marshmoreton. He chuckled amiably at the  recollection. He was an easily amused man. \"You ought to read it,  my boy. Some of it was capital . . .\"    \"John!\"    \"But deplorable, of course,\" added Lord Marshmoreton hastily. \"Very  deplorable.\" He endeavoured to regain his sister's esteem by a show  of righteous indignation. \"What do you mean by it, damn it? You're  my only son. I have watched you grow from child to boy, from boy to  man, with tender solicitude. I have wanted to be proud of you. And  all the time, dash it, you are prowling about London like a lion,  seeking whom you may devour, terrorising the metropolis, putting  harmless policemen in fear of their lives. . .\"    \"Will you listen to me for a moment?\" shouted Percy. He began to  speak rapidly, as one conscious of the necessity of saying his say  while the saying was good. \"The facts are these. I was walking  along Piccadilly on my way to lunch at the club, when, near  Burlington Arcade, I was amazed to see Maud.\"    Lady Caroline uttered an exclamation.    \"Maud? But Maud was here.\"    \"I can't understand it,\" went on Lord Marshmoreton, pursuing his  remarks. Righteous indignation had, he felt, gone well. It might be  judicious to continue in that vein, though privately he held the  opinion that nothing in Percy's life so became him as this assault  on the Force. Lord Marshmoreton, who in his time had committed all  the follies of youth, had come to look on his blameless son as  scarcely human. \"It's not as if you were wild. You've never got  into any scrapes at Oxford. You've spent your time collecting old  china and prayer rugs. You wear flannel next your skin . . .\"    \"Will you please be quiet,\" said Lady Caroline impatiently. \"Go  on, Percy.\"    \"Oh, very well,\" said Lord Marshmoreton. \"I only spoke. I merely  made a remark.\"    \"You say you saw Maud in Piccadilly, Percy?\"    \"Precisely. I was on the point of putting it down to an extraordinary  resemblance, when suddenly she got into a cab. Then I knew.\"    Lord Marshmoreton could not permit this to pass in silence. He was  a fair-minded man.    \"Why shouldn't the girl have got into a cab? Why must a girl  walking along Piccadilly be my daughter Maud just because she got  into a cab. London,\" he proceeded, warming to the argument and  thrilled by the clearness and coherence of his reasoning, \"is full  of girls who take cabs.\"    \"She didn't take a cab.\"    \"You just said she did,\" said Lord Marshmoreton cleverly.    \"I said she got into a cab. There was somebody else already in the  cab. A man. Aunt Caroline, it was the man.\"    \"Good gracious,\" ejaculated Lady Caroline, falling into a chair as  if she had been hamstrung.    \"I am absolutely convinced of it,\" proceeded Lord Belpher solemnly.  \"His behaviour was enough to confirm my suspicions. The cab had  stopped in a block of the traffic, and I went up and requested him  in a perfectly civil manner to allow me to look at the lady who had  just got in. He denied that there was a lady in the cab. And I had  seen her jump in with my own eyes. Throughout the conversation he  was leaning out of the window with the obvious intention of  screening whoever was inside from my view. I followed him along  Piccadilly in another cab, and tracked him to the Carlton. When I  arrived there he was standing on the pavement outside. There were  no signs of Maud. I demanded that he tell me her whereabouts. . .\"    \"That reminds me,\" said Lord Marshmoreton cheerfully, \"of a story I  read in one of the papers. I daresay it's old. Stop me if you've  heard it. A woman says to the maid: 'Do you know anything of my  husband's whereabouts?' And the maid replies--\"    \"Do be quiet,\" snapped Lady Caroline. \"I should have thought that  you would be interested in a matter affecting the vital welfare of  your only daughter.\"    \"I am. I am,\" said Lord Marshmoreton hastily. \"The maid replied:  'They're at the wash.' Of course I am. Go on, Percy. Good God, boy,  don't take all day telling us your story.\"    \"At that moment the fool of a policeman came up and wanted to know  what the matter was. I lost my head. I admit it freely. The  policeman grasped my shoulder, and I struck him.\"    \"Where?\" asked Lord Marshmoreton, a stickler for detail.    \"What does that matter?\" demanded Lady Caroline. \"You did quite  right, Percy. These insolent jacks in office ought not to be  allowed to manhandle people. Tell me, what this man was like?\"    \"Extremely ordinary-looking. In fact, all I can remember about him  was that he was clean-shaven. I cannot understand how Maud could  have come to lose her head over such a man. He seemed to me to  have no attraction whatever,\" said Lord Belpher, a little  unreasonably, for Apollo himself would hardly appear attractive  when knocking one's best hat off.    \"It must have been the same man.\"    \"Precisely. If we wanted further proof, he was an American. You  recollect that we heard that the man in Wales was American.\"    There was a portentous silence. Percy stared at the floor. Lady  Caroline breathed deeply. Lord Marshmoreton, feeling that something  was expected of him, said \"Good Gad!\" and gazed seriously at a  stuffed owl on a bracket. Maud and Reggie Byng came in.    \"What ho, what ho, what ho!\" said Reggie breezily. He always  believed in starting a conversation well, and putting people at  their ease. \"What ho! What ho!\"    Maud braced herself for the encounter.    \"Hullo, Percy, dear,\" she said, meeting her brother's accusing eye  with the perfect composure that comes only from a thoroughly guilty  conscience. \"What's all this I hear about your being the Scourge of  London?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22345"],[0,"Memoirs of the Private Life, Return, and Reign of Napoleon in 1815, Vol. I (#11)"],[1,"singly, appears unjustifiable or hateful, loses  that character when viewed as one of the series of events from which  it arose, as a connecting link in the political chain of which it  forms a part. Neither should the conduct of a sovereign be judged  according to the principles of natural equity. In the estimation of  those, upon whom the task of ruling nations has devolved, necessity  and the public safety ought to know no law. Every apprehension of  injuring private interest vanishes, and must ever vanish, before state  considerations.    \"After all,\" continued they, \"the real point at issue is, not whether  the government of Napoleon was more or less despotic; but whether it  was such as was required by the character of his people and of his  times,--such as it needed to be, in order that France might become  tranquil, happy, and powerful.\" Now it is impossible to deny but that,  during the reign of Napoleon, the interior of France enjoyed an  unruffled calm, and that the ascendancy of his genius bestowed upon  the country a degree of power and prosperity, which it never attained  before, and which probably it will never possess again.    Was the emperor taxed with boundless ambition? Were the calamities of  Spain and Russia laid to his charge?--his indefatigable apologists  found a ready answer.--The Spanish war, instead of being an unjust  aggression, was an enterprise guided by the soundest political talent.  It had been provoked by the wavering treachery of that allied  government, which, in spite of its engagements, was secretly  negociating with the English; and which, yielding to their  instigations, had endeavoured to take advantage of our difficulties  and of the absence of our armies, in order to invade our territory,  and to become a sharer in the plots of our enemies.    The detention of Ferdinand ceased to be an odious breach of faith. It  resulted necessarily from his duplicity, his parricidal projects, and  his English connexions. The nomination of Joseph as King of Spain and  the Indies, had been universally attributed to the excessive vanity of  Napoleon, who, as it was supposed, was determined to drop a crown upon  the head of every member of the imperial family. But now opinion  changed. King Joseph's promotion was felt to have been caused by the  necessity of placing Spain for ever out of the reach of English  influence. Had not Napoleon allowed the Cortes of Spain to elect their  monarch of their own uncontrolled authority? Had he not said to them  in public, \"Dispose of the throne. Little do I care whether the king  of Spain is called Ferdinand, or whether he is called Joseph; let him  only be the ally of France, and the enemy of England[20]?\"                       [Footnote 20: The Emperor thus addressed the                     Spanish Cortes; when assembled at Bayonne.]    It was still more easy to justify the Russian war. A Quixotic love of  the marvellous was no longer supposed to be the passion which excited  it. In making war against Russia, he was actuated by the desire of  avenging the injuries which that power had occasioned to France, at  the moment when the Russian government again opened its ports to the  English, thus snatching from the nation the reward of the sacrifices  which we had made for the establishment and consolidation of the  continental blockade,--of that universal barrier which made England  and her thousand vessels tremble!    The invasion of Germany was no longer the effect of Napoleon's  insatiate thirst of power and glory[21]. It was seen, that there was  no other sure method, by which the English, the irreconcilable  enemies of France, could be deprived of their fatal continental  influence, by which they could be compelled to abandon the empire of  the seas. In short, Napoleon was only inflicting a salutary and  equitable punishment, deserved by those sovereigns of all sizes. After  having implored or obtained the alliance of Napoleon, and after having  ratified the bond by engagements and promises upon which he generously  relied, they compelled him to take up arms, in order to prevent them  from receiving the agents of England into their cabinets, and her  merchandizes into their ports.                       [Footnote 21: Napoleon was accused of having                     aspired to universal monarchy. In all ages, this                     desire has been imputed to powerful and ambitious                     sovereigns. Let us confess that no monarch was ever                     better justified in yielding to the seductions of                     this brilliant phantom than Napoleon. From the                     summit of his throne he held the reins which guided                     the greater part of Europe, whose docile monarchs                     instantly obeyed any direction which he chose to                     give them. At the first word, at the slightest                     signal, their subjects were arrayed beneath the                     imperial eagle. Their continual intercourse with                     us, the obligation of obeying Napoleon, an                     obligation imposed upon them by their own princes,                     had accustomed them to consider the Emperor as                     their chieftain. But whatever ambition may have                     been attributed to Napoleon, his good sense                     restrained him from aspiring to universal monarchy.                     He had another plan; he intended to re-establish                     the eastern and western empires. It would now be                     useless to reveal the lofty and powerful                     considerations by which this grand and noble idea                     was suggested to Napoleon. Then, France might have                     been allowed to grasp again the sceptre of                     Charlemagne: but now, we must forget that we have                     been the masters of the world.]    Thus the partisans of Napoleon invented arguments by which they  palliated his faults and justified his errors. No objection, no  reproach was left without its answer. After defending him against his  accusers they became his advocates; and, turning to the fairer pages  of his history, their praises knew no bounds; these eulogiums were  certainly more just, and, perhaps, more sincere.    \"Napoleon,\" said they, \"had all the great qualities of the greatest  monarchs, whilst he was exempted from their vices. Napoleon was not  stained by the lechery of Caesar, nor by the drunkenness of Alexander,  nor by the cruelty of Charlemagne.\"    At an age when others scarcely start in life, his years were  outnumbered by his victories; and the kings of Europe, conquered by  his sword or subjugated by his genius, cowered before the imperial  eagle.    In France, when aggrandized by the conquests of Napoleon, the empire  of ancient Rome was re-produced before the astonished world. The  French name, tarnished by the crimes of the revolution, regained its  ancient honour and its mastery. The nation was feared, admired, and  respected by the entire universe.    Philosophy graced Napoleon no less than warlike prowess. After he had  covered the nation with glory by his victories, he was willing to  insure our welfare by his laws. He bestowed upon us that immortal code  of jurisprudence which invested him with the title of the legislator  of France, a title to which our former kings had aspired in vain. He  organised that admirable system of finance and administration, which  their subjects, groaning under misrule, implored but without effect.    Still he had not accomplished enough to satisfy his noble and  beneficent ardour. Arts, sciences, and industry were to flourish in  our country. The munificent aids[22] which were granted by Napoleon,  created the thousands and thousands of manufactories from whence  proceeded those finished works of skill and labour which became the  pride of the French, and the despair and ruin of foreign nations. The  sons of Apollo[23], on whom he lavished his gifts and favours, seized  the crayon, the compass, and the chisel. Paris became a second  Athens, when adorned by the wonders of art to which his munificence  gave birth. We then saw the venerable Louvre rise, as by enchantment,  from its deserted ruins; the palaces of our Kings became more  gorgeous; the temples of the arts were enriched by productions which  rivalled the relics of antiquity; our native land brought forth those  establishments so proudly useful to the public, and those monuments  destined to transmit the recollections of our fame and glory to the  most distant posterity.                       [Footnote 22: Neither the nature nor the extent of                     these aids has been well understood out of France.                     Napoleon revived our industry by the loans, which                     he never hesitated to grant to any enterprising                     manufacturer who needed capital; and this                     assistance was always liberal and well-timed.]                       [Footnote 23: Louis XIV., who has been so much                     praised for his liberality, only distributed 52,300                     francs per annum to the literati and artists of                     France, and 14,000 francs to foreigners.]    At the same moment his sovereign will guided the hands which curbed  the waves of the ocean, and caused them to roll over a new abyss. He  directed those labours which substituted wide harbours, superb  dock-yards, and fertilizing canals, in the place of desert shores and  pestilential marshes, restoring commerce and existence to the  innumerable inhabitants of the sea coast, and of the banks of the  Scheld and the Somme. At the same moment his voice created those Roman  highways, branching through all parts of France, and Germany, and  Italy, equally useful and majestic, and which afforded to the  inhabitants of "]]]
