Some former  landslide had quarter dammed the river at that point, and the drift of  seasonal floods was caught in and among the rocky pile to form a prickly  peninsula.    \"In there----\"    They brought the raft to shore, fighting the faster current. The  wolverines, who had been subdued by the heat and the dust, flung  themselves to the rocks with the eagerness of passengers deserting a  sinking ship for certain rescue. Thorvald settled the map case more  securely between his arm and side before he took the same leap. When  they were all ashore he prodded the raft out into the stream again,  pushing the platform along until it was sucked by the current past the  line of boulders.    \"Listen!\"    But Shann had already caught that distant rumble of sound. It was  steady, beating like some giant drum. Certainly it did not herald a  Throg ship in flight and it came from ahead, not from their back trail.    \"Rapids ... perhaps even the falls,\" Thorvald interpreted that faint  thunder. \"Now, let's see what kind of a road we can find here.\"    The tongue of boulders, spiked with driftwood, was firmly based against  the wall of the cut. But it sloped up to within a few feet of the top of  that gap, more than one landslide having contributed to its fashioning.  The landing stage paralleled the river for perhaps some fifty feet.  Beyond it water splashed a straight wall. They would have to climb and  follow the stream along the top of the embankment, maybe being forced  well away from the source of the water.    By unspoken consent they both knelt and drank deeply from their cupped  hands, splashing more of the liquid over their heads, washing the dust  from their skins. Then they began to climb the rough assent up which the  wolverines had already vanished. The murk above them was less solid, but  again the fine grit streaked their faces, embedding itself in their  hair.    Shann paused to scrape a film of mud from his lips and chin. Then he  made the last pull, bracing his slight body against the push of the wind  he met there. A palm struck hard between his shoulders, nearly sending  him sprawling. He had only wits enough left to recognize that as an  order to get on, and he staggered ahead until rock arched over him and  the sand drift was shut off.    His shoulder met solid stone, and having rubbed the sand from his eyes,  Shann realized he was in a pocket in the cliff walls. Well overhead he  caught a glimpse of natural amber sky through a slit, but here was a  twilight which thickened into complete darkness.    There was no sign of wolverines. Thorvald moved along the pocket  southward, and Shann followed him. Once more they faced a dead end. For  the crevice, with the sheer descent to the river on the right, the cliff  wall at its back, came to an abrupt stop in a drop which caught at  Shann's stomach when he ventured to look down.    If some battleship of the interstellar fleet had aimed a force beam  across the mountains of Warlock, cutting down to what lay under the  first envelope of planet-skin, perhaps the resulting wound might have  resembled that slash. What had caused such a break between the height on  which they stood and the much taller peak beyond, Shann could not guess.  But it must have been a cataclysm of spectacular dimensions. There was  certainly no descending to the bottom of that cut and reclimbing the  rock face on the other side. The fugitives would either have to return  to the river with all its ominous warnings of trouble to come, or find  some other path across that gap which now provided such an effective  barrier to the west.    \"Down!\" Just as Thorvald had pushed him out of the murk of the dust  storm into the crevice, so now did that officer jerk Shann from his  feet, forcing him to the floor of the half cave from which they had  partially emerged.    A shadow moved across the bright band of sunlit sky.    \"Back!\" Thorvald caught at Shann again, his greater strength prevailing  as he literally dragged the younger man into the dusk of the crevice.  And he did not pause, nor allow Shann to do so, even when they were well  undercover again. At last they reached the dark hole in the southern  wall which they had passed earlier. And a push from Thorvald sent his  companion into that.    Then a blow greater than any the Survey officer had aimed at him struck  Shann. He was hurled against a rough wall with impetus enough to explode  the air from his lungs, the ensuing pain so great that he feared his  ribs had given under that thrust. Before his eyes fire lashed down the  slit, searing him into temporary blindness. That flash was the last  thing he remembered as thick darkness closed in, shutting him into the  nothingness of unconsciousness.    It hurt to breathe; he was slowly aware first of that pain and then the  fact that he _was_ breathing, that he had to endure the pain for the  sake of breath. His whole body was jarred into a dull torment as a  weight pressed upon his twisted legs. Then strong animal breath puffed  into his face. Shann lifted one hand by will power, touched thick fur,  felt the rasp of a tongue laid wetly across his fingers.    Something close to terror engulfed him for a second or two when he knew  that he could not see! The black about him was colored by jagged flashes  of red which he somehow guessed were actually inside his eyes. He groped  through that fire-pierced darkness. An animal whimper from the throat of  the shaggy body pressed against him; he answered that movement.    \"Taggi?\"    The shove against him was almost enough to pin him once more to the  wall, a painful crush on his aching ribs, as the wolverine responded to  his name. That second nudge from the other side must be Togi's bid for  attention.    But what had happened? Thorvald had hurled him back just after that  shadow had swung over the ledge. That shadow! Shann's wits quickened as  he tried to make sense of what he could remember. A Throg ship! Then  that fiery lash which had cut after them could only have resulted from  one of those energy bolts such as had wiped out the others of his kind  at the camp. But he was still alive----!    \"Thorvald?\" He called through his personal darkness. When there was no  answer, Shann called again, more urgently. Then he hunched forward on  his hands and knees, pushing Taggi gently aside, running his hands over  projecting rocks, uneven flooring.    His fingers touched what could only be cloth, before they met the warmth  of flesh. And he half threw himself against the supine body of the  Survey officer, groping awkwardly for heartbeat, for some sign that the  other was still living.    \"What----?\" The one word came thickly, but Shann gave something close to a  sob of relief as he caught the faint mutter. He squatted back on his  heels, pressed his forearm against his aching eyes in a kind of fierce  will to see.    Perhaps that pressure did relieve some of the blackout, for when he  blinked again, the complete dark and the fiery trails had faded to gray,  and he was sure he saw dimly a source of light to his left.    The Throg ship had fired upon them. But the aliens could not have used  the full force of their weapon or neither of the Terrans would still be  alive. Which meant, Shann's thoughts began to make sense--sense which  brought apprehension--the Throgs probably intended to disable rather  than kill. They wanted prisoners, just as Thorvald had warned.    How long did the Terrans have before the aliens would come to collect  them? There was no fit landing place hereabouts for their flyer. The  beetle-heads would have to set down at the edge of the desert land and  climb the mountains on foot. And the Throgs were not good at that. So,  the fugitives still had a measure of time.    Time to do what? The country itself held them securely captive. That  drop to the southwest was one barrier. To retreat eastward would mean  running straight into the hands of the hunters. To descend again to the  river, their raft gone, was worse than useless. There was only this side  pocket in which they sheltered. And once the Throgs arrived, they could  scoop the Terrans out at their leisure, perhaps while stunned by a  controlling energy beam.    \"Taggi? Togi?\" Shann was suddenly aware that he had not heard the  wolverines for some time.    He was answered by a weirdly muffled call--from the south! Had the  animals found a new exit? Was this niche more than just a niche? A cave  of some length, or even a passage running back into the interior of the  peaks? With that faint hope spurring him, Shann bent again over  Thorvald, able now to make out the other's huddled form. Then he drew  the torch from the inner loop of his coat and pressed the lowest stud.    His eyes smarted in answer to that light, watered until tears patterned  the grime and dust on his cheeks. But he could make out what lay before  them, a hole leading into the cliff face, the hole which might furnish  the door to escape.    The Survey officer moved, levering himself up, his eyes screwed tightly  shut.    \"Lantee?\"    \"Here. And there's a tunnel--right behind you. The wolverines went that  way....\"    To his surprise there was a thin ghost of a smile on Thorvald's usually  straight-lipped mouth. \"And we'd better be away before visitors arrive?\"    So he, too, must have thought his way through the sequence of past  action to the same conclusion concerning the Throg movements.    \"Can you see, Lantee?\" The question was painfully casual, but a note in  it, almost a reaching for reassurance, cut for the first time through  the wall which had stood between them from their chance meeting by the  wrecked ship.    \"Better now. I couldn't when I first came to,\" Shann answered quickly.    Thorvald opened his eyes, but Shann guessed that he was as blind as he  himself had been, He caught at the officer's nearer hand, drawing it to  rest on his own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20796"],[0,"The Colors of Space (#11)"],[1," got into the silky,  silvery tights and cloak that Raynor had provided. He could use his  hands now as if they belonged to him; he even found the claws handy and  useful. He could write his signature, and copy out instructions from the  training tape, without a moment's hesitation.    Toward dusk, a young Lhari slipped unobserved out of Raynor's house and  hiked unnoticed to the edges of a small city nearby, where he mingled  with the crowd and hired a skycab from an unobservant human driver to  take him to the spaceport city. The skycab driver was startled, but not,  Bart judged, unusually so, to pick up a Lhari passenger.    \"Been doing a little sight-seeing on our planet, hey?\"    \"That's right,\" Bart said in Universal, not trying to fake his idea of  the Lhari accent. Raynor had told him that only a few of the Lhari had  that characteristic sibilant \"r\" and \"s\" and warned him against trying  to imitate it. _Just speak naturally; there are dialects of Lhari, just  as there are dialects of the different human languages, and they all  sound different in Universal anyhow._ \"Just looking around some.\"    The skycab driver frowned and looked down at his controls, and Bart felt  curiously snubbed. Then he remembered. He himself had little to say to  the Lhari when they spoke to him.    _He was an alien, a monster. He couldn't expect to be treated like a  human being any more._    When the skycab let him off before the spaceport, it felt strange to see  how the crowds edged away from him as he made a way through them. He  caught a glimpse of himself in one of the mirror-ramps, a tall thin  strange form in a metallic cloak, head crested with feathery white, and  felt overwhelmingly homesick for his own familiar face.    He was beginning to feel hungry, and realized that he could not go into  an ordinary restaurant without attracting attention. There were  refreshment stands all over the spaceport, and he briefly considered  getting a snack at one of these.    No, that was just putting it off. The time had to come when he must face  his fear and test his disguise among the Lhari themselves. Reviewing his  knowledge of the construction of spaceports, he remembered that one side  was the terminal, where humans and visitors and passengers were freely  admitted; the other side, for Lhari and their Mentorian employees only,  contained--along with business offices of many sorts--a sort of arcade  with amusement centers, shops and restaurants catering to the personnel  of the Lhari ships. With nine or ten ships docking every day, Raynor had  assured him that a strange Lhari face would be lost in the crowds very  easily.    He went to one of the doors marked DANGER, LHARI LIGHTS BEYOND, and  passed through the glaring corridor of offices and storage-warehouses,  finally coming out into a sort of wide mall. The lights were fierce, but  he could endure them without trouble now, though his head ached faintly.  Raynor, testing his light tolerance, had assured him that he could endure  anything the Lhari could, without permanent damage to his optic nerves,  though he would have headaches until he got used to them.    There were small shops and what looked like bars, and a glass-fronted  place with a sign lettered largely, in black letters, a Lhari phrase  meaning roughly HOME AWAY FROM HOME: MEALS SERVED, SPACEMEN WELCOME,  REASONABLE.    Behind him a voice said in Lhari, \"Tell me, does that sign mean what it  says? Or is this one of those traps for separating the unwary spaceman  from his hard-earned credits? How's the food?\"    Bart carefully took hold of himself.    \"I was just wondering that myself.\" He turned as he spoke, finding  himself face to face with a young Lhari in the unadorned cloak of a  spaceman without official rank. He knew the Lhari was young because his  crest was still white.    The young Lhari extended his claws in the closed-fist, hidden-claw  gesture of Lhari greeting. \"Shall we take a chance? Ringg son of Rahan  greets you.\"    \"Bartol son of Berihun.\"    \"I don't remember seeing you in the port, Bartol.\"    \"I've mostly worked on the Polaris run.\"    \"Way off there?\" Ringg son of Rahan sounded startled and impressed. \"You  really get around, don't you? Shall we sit here?\"    They sat on triangular chairs at a three-cornered table. Bart waited for  Ringg to order, and ordered what he did. When it came, it was a sort of  egg-and-fish casserole which Bart found extremely tasty, and he dug into  it with pleasure. Allowing for the claws, Lhari table manners were not  so much different from human--_and remember, their customs differ as  much as ours do. If you do something differently, they'll just think  you're from another planet with a different culture._    \"Have you been here long?\"    \"A day or so. I'm off the _Swiftwing_.\"    Bart decided to hazard his luck. \"I was told there's a vacancy on the  _Swiftwing_.\"    Ringg looked at him curiously. \"There is,\" he said, \"but I'd like to  know how you found it out. Captain Vorongil said that anyone who talked  about it would be sent to Kleeto for three cycles. But what happened to  you? Miss your ship?\"    \"No, I've just been laying off--traveling, sight-seeing, bumming  around,\" Bart said. \"But I'm tired of it, and now I'd like to sign out  again.\"    \"Well, we could use another man. This is the long run we're making, out  to Antares and then home, and if everybody has to work extra shifts,  it's no fun. But if old Vorongil knows that there's been talk in the  port about Klanerol jumping ship, or whatever happened to him, we'll all  have to walk wide of his temper.\"    Bart was beginning to relax a little; Ringg apparently accepted him  without scrutiny. At this close range Ringg did not seem a monster, but  just a young fellow like himself, hearty, good-natured--in fact, not  unlike Tommy.    Bart chased the thought away as soon as it sneaked into his brain--one  of those _things_, like _Tommy_? Then, rather grimly, he reminded  himself, _I'm one of those things_. He said irritably, \"So how do I  account for asking your captain for the place?\"    Ringg cocked his fluffy crest to one side. \"I know,\" he said, \"_I_ told  you. I'll say you're an old friend of mine. You don't know what  Vorongil's like when he gets mad. But what he doesn't know, he won't  shout about.\" He shoved back the triangular chair. \"Who _did_ tell you,  anyway?\"    This was the first real hurdle, and Bart's brain raced desperately, but  Ringg was not listening for an answer. \"I suppose somebody gossiped, or  one of those fool Mentorians picked it up. Got your papers? What  rating?\"    \"Astrogator first class.\"    \"Klanerol was second, but you can't have everything, I suppose.\" Ringg  led the way through the arcades, out across a guarded sector, passing  half a dozen of the huge ships lying in their pits. Finally Ringg  stopped and pointed. \"This is the old hulk.\"    Bart had traveled only in Lhari passenger ships, which were new and  fresh and sleek. This ship was enormous, ovoid like the egg of some  space-monster, the sides dented and discolored, thin films of chemical  discoloration lying over the glassy metallic hull.    Bart followed Ringg. This was real, it was happening. He was signing out  for his first interstellar cruise on one of the Lhari ships. Not a  Mentorian assistant, half-trusted, half-tolerated, but one of the crew  themselves. _If I'm lucky_, he reminded himself grimly.    There was Lhari, in the black-banded officer's cloak, at the doorway. He  glanced at Ringg's papers.    \"Friend of mine,\" Ringg said, and Bart proffered his folder. The Lhari  gave it a casual glance, handed it back.    \"Old Baldy on board?\" Ringg asked.    \"Where else?\" The officer laughed. \"You don't think _he'd_ relax with  cargo not loaded, do you?\"    They seemed casual and normal, and Bart's confidence was growing. They  had accepted him as one of themselves. But the great ordeal still lay  before him--an interview with the Lhari captain. And the idea had Bart  sweating scared.    The corridors and decks seemed larger, wider, more spacious, but  shabbier than on the clean, bright, commercial passenger decks Bart had  seen. Dark-lensed men were rolling bales of cargo along on wheeled  dollies. The corridors seemed endless. More to hear the sound of his own  voice, and reassure himself of his ability to speak and be understood,  than because he cared, he asked Ringg, \"What's your rating?\"    \"Well, according to the logbooks, I'm an Expert Class Two,  Metals-Fatigue,\" said Ringg. \"That sounds very technical and  interesting. But what it means is just that I go all over the ship inch  by inch, and when I finish, start all over again at the other end. Most  of what I do is just boss around the maintenance crews and snarl at them  about spots of rust on the paint.\"    They got into a small round elevator and Ringg punched buttons; it began  to rise, slowly and creakily, toward the top. \"This, for instance,\"  Ringg said. \"I've been yelling for a new cable for six months.\" He  turned. \"Take it easy, Bartol; don't let Vorongil scare you. He likes to  hear the sound of his own voice, but we'd all walk out the lock without  spacesuits for him.\"    The elevator slid to a stop. The sign in Lhari letters said _Level of  Administration--Officers' Deck_. Ringg pushed at a door and said,  \"Captain Vorongil?\"    \"I thought you were on leave,\" said a Lhari voice, deeper and slower  than most. \"What are you doing, back here more than ten milliseconds  before strap-in checks?\"    Ringg stepped back for Bart to go inside. The small cabin, with an  elliptical bunk slung from the ceiling and a triangular table, was  dwarfed by a tall, thin Lhari, in a cloak with four of the black bands  that seemed to denote rank among them. He had a deeply lined face with a  lacework of tiny wrinkles around the slanted eyes. His crest was not the  high, fluffy white of a young Lhari, but broken short near the scalp,  grayish pink"]]]
