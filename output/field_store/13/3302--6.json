Opening from  the western side of the cloister, but actually standing in  the outer court, is the refectory (G), a large cruciform  building, about 100 feet each way, decorated within with  frescoes of saints.

FIG. 1.---Monastery of Santa Laura, Mount Athos (Lenoir).    at Rome, in which is placed the seat of the hegumenos or  abbot.  This apartment is chiefly used as a hall of meeting, the  oriental monks usually taking their meals in their separate cells.    Vatopede    St Laura is exceeded in magnitude by the convent of Vatopede  also on Mount Athos.  This enormous establishment covers at  least 4 acres of ground, and contains so many separate buildings  within its massive walls that it resembles a fortified town.  It  lodges above 300 monks, and the establishment of the hegumenos is  described as resembling the court of a petty sovereign prince.  The immense refectory, of the same cruciform shape as that of  St Laura, will accommodate 500 guests at its 24 marble tables.    The annexed plan of a Coptic monastery, from Lenoir,  shows a church of three aisles, with cellular apses, and  two ranges of cells on either side of an oblong gallery.    Benedictine.    Monasticism in the West owes its extension and development  to Benedict of Nursia (born A.D. 480).  His rule was  diffused with miraculous rapidity from the parent foundation  on Monte Cassino through the whole of western Europe, and  every country witnessed the erection of monasteries far  exceeding anything that had yet been seen in spaciousness and  splendour.  Few great towns in Italy were without their  Benedictine convent, and they quickly rose in all the great  centres of population in England, France and Spain.  The number  of these monasteries founded between A.D. 520 and 700 is  amazing.  Before the Council of Constance, A.D. 1415, no  fewer than 15,070 abbeys had been established of this order  alone.  The buildings of a Benedictine abbey were uniformly  arranged ofter one plan, modified where necessary (as at  Durham and Worcester, where the monasteries stand close to the  steep bank of a river) to accommodate the arrangement to local  circumstances.  We have no existing examples of the earlier  monasteries of the Benedictine order.  They have all yielded  to the ravages of time and the violence of man.  But we  have fortunately preserved to us an elaborate plan of the  great Swiss monastery of St Gall, erected about A.D. 820,  which puts us in possession of the whole arrangements of a  monastery of the first class towards the early part of the 9th  century.  This curious and interesting plan has been made  the subject of a memoir both by Keller (Zurich, 1844) and by  Professor Robert Willis (Arch. Journal, 1848, vol. v. pp.  86-117.  To the latter we are indebted for the substance of  the following description, as well as for the plan, reduced  from his elucidated transcript of the original preserved     FIG. 2.---Plan of Coptic Monastery.  A. Narthex. B. Church.  C. Corridor, with cells on each side.  D. Staircase.    in the archives of the convent.  The general apperance  of the convent is that of a town of isolated houses with  streets running between them.  It is evidently planned in  compliance with the Benedictine rule, which enjoined that,  if possible, the monastery should contain within itself  every necessary of life, as well as the buildings more  intimately connected with the religious and social life of its  inmates.  It should comprise a mill, a bakehouse, stables  and cow-houses, together with accommodation for carrying  on all necessary mechanical arts within the walls, so as to  obviate the necessity of the monks going outside its limits.    The general distribution of the buildings may be thus  described:-The church, with its cloister to the south, occupies  the centre of a quadrangular area, about 430 feet square.  The  buildings, as in all great monasteries, are distributed into  groups.  The church forms the nucleus, as the centre of the  religious life of the community.  In closest connexion with  the church is the group of buildings appropriated to the  monastic line and its daily requirements---the refectory for  eating, the dormitory for sleeping, the common room for social  intercourse, the chapter-house for religious and disciplinary  conference.  These essential elements of monastic life  are ranged about a cloister court, surrounded by a covered  arcade, affording communication sheltered ftom the elements  between the various buildings.  The infirmary for sick monks,  with the physician's house and physic garden, lies to the  east.  In the same group with the infirmary is the school for  the novices.  The outer school, with its headmaster's house  against the opposite wall of the church, stands outside the  convent enclosure, in close proximity to the abbot's house,  that he might have a constant eye over them.  The buildings  devoted to hospitality are divided into three groups,--one  for the reception of distinguished guests, another for monks  visiting the monastery, a third for poor travellers and  pilgrims.  The first and third are placed to the right and  left of the common entrance of the monastery,---the hospitium  for distinguished guests being placed on the north side of the  church, not far from the abbot's house; that for the poor  on the south side next to the farm buildings.  The monks are  lodged in a guest-house built against the north wall of the  church.  The group of buildings connected with the material  wants of the establishment is placed to the south and west  of the church, and is distinctly separated from the monastic  buildings.  The kitchen, buttery and offices are reached by a  passage from the west end of the refectory, and are connected  with the bakehouse and brewhouse, which are placed still farther  away.  The whole of the southern and western sides is devoted to  workshops, stables and farm-buildings.  The buildings, with some  exceptions, seem to have been of one story only, and all but  the church were probably erected of wood.  The whole includes  thirty-three separate blocks.  The church (D) is cruciform,  with a nave of nine bays, and a semicircular apse at either  extremity.  That to the west is surrounded by a semicircular  colonnade, leaving an open ``paradise'' (E) between it and  the wall of the church.  The whole area is divided by screens  into various chapels.  The high altar (A) stands immediately  to the east of the transept, or ritual choir; the altar  of St Paul (B) in the eastern, and that of St Peter (C) in  the western apse.  A cylindrical campanile stands detached  from the church on either side of the western apse (FF).

On this side in later monasteries  we invariably find the chapterhouse, the absence of  which in this plan is somewhat surprising.  It appears,  however, from the inscriptions on the plan itself, that the  north walk of the cloisters served for the purposes of a  chapter-house, and was fitted up with benches on the long  sides.  Above the calefactory is the ``dormitory'' opening  into the south transept of the church, to enable the monks  to attend the nocturnal services with readiness.

The stewards and waiters are  coloured people, clean, neat, and active; and you may give  sevenpence-halfpenny or a quarter-dollar to the man who cleans your  boots, or an attentive waiter, if you like; if not, you can keep it, as  they are well paid.    The ladies' cabin has generally a large cheval glass and a piano, with a  white lady to wait, who is always decked out in flounces and furbelows,  and usually good-looking. All you have got to do on embarking or on  disembarking is to see personally to your luggage; for leaving it to a  servant unacquainted with the country will not do. At Kingston, matters  are pretty well arranged, and the carters are not so very impudent, and  so ready to push you over the wharf; but at Toronto they are very so so,  and want regulating by the police; and in the States, at Buffalo  particularly, the porters and carters are the most presuming and  insolent serviles I ever met with; they rush in a body on board the  boat, and respect neither persons nor things.    I knew an American family composed chiefly of females, travelling to the  Falls; and these ladies had their baggage taken to a train going inland,  whilst they were embarking on board the British boat which was to convey  them to Chippewa in Canada.    The comfort of some of these boats, as they call them, but which ought  to be called ships, is very great. There is a regular drawingroom on  board one called the Chief Justice where I saw, just after the  horticultural show at Toronto, pots of the most rare and beautiful  flowers, arranged very tastefully, with a piano, highly-coloured  nautical paintings and portraits, and a _tout ensemble_, which, when the  lamps were lit, and conversation going on between the ladies and  gentlemen then and there assembled, made one quite forget we were at sea  on Lake Ontario, the \"Beautiful Lake,\" which, like other beautiful  creations, can be very angry if vexed.    The Americans have very fine steam vessels on their side of the lake,  but they are flimsily constructed, painted glaringly, white, and green,  and yellow, without comfort or good attendance, and with a  devil-may-care sort of captain, who seems really scarcely to know or to  care whether he has passengers or has not, a scrambling hurried meal,  and divers other unmentionables.    The American gentry always prefer the British boats, for two good  reasons; they see Queen Victoria's people, and they meet with the utmost  civility, attention, and comfort. They sit down to dinner, or  breakfast, or tea, like Christian men and women, where there is no  railway eating and drinking; where due time is spent in refreshing the  body and spirits; and where people help each other, or the waiters help  them, at table, without a scramble, like hogs, for the best and the  most--a custom which all travelled Americans detest and abominate as  much as the most fastidious Englishman.    It is not unusual at hotel dinners, or on board steamers, to see a man,  I cannot call him a gentleman, sitting next a female, totally neglect  her, and heap his plate with fish, with flesh, with pie, with pudding,  with potato, with cranberry jam, with pickles, with salad, with all and  every thing then within his reach, swallow in a trice all this jumble of  edibles, jump up and vanish.    Can such a being have a stomach, or a digestion, and must he not  necessarily, about thirty-five years of age, be yellow, spare, and  parchment-skinned, with angular projections, and a prodigious tendency  to tobacco?    An American gentleman--mind, I lay a stress upon the second word--never  bolts his victuals, never picks his teeth at table, never spits upon the  carpet, or guesses; he knows not gin-sling, and he eschews mint-julep;  but he does, I am ashamed to say, admire a sherry cobbler, particularly  if he does not get a second-hand piece of vermicelli to suck it through.  Reader, do you know what a sherry cobbler is? I will enlighten you. Let  the sun shine at about 80 deg. Fahrenheit. Then take a lump of ice; fix it  at the edge of a board; rasp it with a tool made like a drawing knife or  carpenter's plane, set face upwards. Collect the raspings, the fine  raspings, mind, in a capacious tumbler; pour thereon two glasses of good  sherry, and a good spoonful of powdered white sugar, with a few small  bits, not slices, but bits of lemon, about as big as a gooseberry. Stir  with a wooden macerator. Drink through a tube of macaroni or vermicelli.  _C'est l'eau benite_, as the English lord said to the _garcon_ at the  Milles Colonnes, when he first tasted real _parfait amour_.--_C'est  beaucoup mieux_, _Milor_, answered the waiter with a profound  reverence.    Gin-sling, cock-tail, mint-julep, are about as vulgar as blue ruin and  old tom at home; but sherry cobbler is an affair of consideration--only  never pound your ice, always rasp it.    It is a custom on board the Canadian steamers for gentlemen to call for  a pint of wine at dinner, or for a bottle, according to the strength of  the party; but it is a custom more honoured in the breach than the  observance; for sherry and port are the usual stock, both fiery as  brandy, and costing the moderate price of seven shillings and sixpence a  bottle, the steward having laid the same in at about one shilling and  eight pence, or at most two shillings. Why this imposition, the only one  you meet with in travelling in Canada at hotels or steamboats, is  perpetrated and perpetuated, I could never learn.    Many American gentlemen, however, encourage it, and have told me that  they do so because they get no good port in the States. Ale and porter  are charged two shillings and sixpence a bottle, which is double their  worth. Be careful also not to drink freely of the iced water, which is  always supplied _ad libitum_. Few Europeans escape the effects of  water-drinking when they land at Quebec, Montreal, Kingston, Toronto,  &c. There is something peculiar, which has never yet been satisfactorily  explained by medical men, in the sudden attack upon the system produced  by the waters of Canada: this is sometimes slight, but more often lasts  several days, and reduces the strength a good deal. Iced water is worse,  and produces country cholera. The Americans use ice profusely, and drink  such draughts of iced water, that I have been astonished at the impunity  with which they did so.    Perhaps the change from a moist sea atmosphere to the dry and  desiccating air of Canada, where iron does not rust, may be one cause of  the malady alluded to, and another, in addition to the water, the  difference of cookery; for here, at public tables and on board the boats  generally, where black cooks prevail, all is butter and grease.    But the change of climate is undoubtedly great. I had been long an  inhabitant of Upper Canada, and fancied myself seasoned; but, having  returned to England, and spending afterwards two or three years in the  excessively humid air of the sea-coast of Newfoundland at St. Johns,  where I became somewhat stout, on my return to Upper Canada, for want of  a little preparatory caution in medicine, although naturally of a spare  habit, I was seized with a violent bleeding at the nose, which baffled  all remedies for several months, until artificial mineral water and a  copious use of solutions of iron stopped it. No doubt this prevented the  fever of the lakes, and was owing to the dryness of the air. I mention  this to caution all new-comers, young and old, to take timely advice and  medicine.    There is another complaint in Upper Canada, which attacks the settler  very soon after his arrival, especially if young, and that is worms; a  disorder very prevalent at all times in Canada, particularly among the  poorer classes, and probably owing to food.    These, with ague and colic, or country cholera, are the chief evils of  the clime; few are, however, fatal, excepting the lake fever, and that  principally among children.    The sportsman should recollect, in so marshy and woody a country,  subject as it is to the most surprising alternations of temperature,  that instead of minding that celebrated rule, \"Keep your powder dry,\" he  should read, \"Keep your feet dry.\" Dry feet and the avoidance of sitting  in wet or damp clothes, or drinking iced water when hot, or of cooling  yourself in a delicious draught of air when in a perspiration, are the  best precautions against ague, fever, colic, or cholera--in a country  where the thermometer reaches 90 deg. in the shade, and sometimes 110 deg., as  it did last summer, and 27 deg. below zero in the winter, with rapid  alternations embracing such a range of the scale as is unknown  elsewhere.    In the country places, in travelling, you will invariably find that  windows are very little attended to, and that the head of your bed, or  the side of it, is placed against a loosely-fitting broken sash. The  night-fogs and damps are highly dangerous to new-comers; so act  accordingly.    Fleas and bugs, and \"such small deer,\" you must expect in every inn you  stop at, even in the cities; for it appears--and indeed I did not know  the fact until this year--that bugs are indigenous, _native to the  soil_, and breed in the bark of old trees; so that if you build a new  house, you bring the enemy into your camp. Nothing but cleanliness and  frequent whitewash, colouring, paint, and soft soap, will get rid of  them. If it were not for the strong smell of red cedar and its extreme  brittleness, I would have my bedstead of that material; for even the  iron bedsteads, in the soldiers' barracks, become infested with them if  not painted often. Red cedar they happily eschew.    Travellers may talk as they please of mosquitoes being the scourge of  new countries; the bugs in Canada are worse, and the black fly and  sand-fly superlatively superior in"]]]
