As I looked at his intelligent, good-natured  countenance, I could not help thinking that the trader had underrated  his intellectual powers.    \"He's a funny dog that Makarooroo,\" said Peterkin, as our interpreter  hastened away to fetch his rusty old gun and spears; for he meant to  join our hunting expedition, although he had only that moment arrived  from a long and fatiguing chase.    \"Do you think so?\" said Jack.    \"I don't agree with you,\" said I; \"to me he seems rather of a grave and  quiet disposition.\"    \"O Ralph, what a bat you are!  He was grave enough just now, truly; but  did you not observe the twinkle in his eye when he spoke to us in  English?  Depend on it he's a funny dog.\"    \"There must be freemasonry, then, among funny dogs,\" I retorted, \"for  Jack and I don't perceive it.\"    \"Is this our canoe?\" inquired Jack of the trader.    \"It is.\"    \"Then let's jump in.\"    In a few seconds the river was crowded with a fleet of small canoes, and  we all paddled quickly up the stream, which was sluggish at that part.  We did not intend to proceed more than a few miles by water, as the  place where game was expected was at some distance from the river.  I  felt some regret at this, for the trip up the river was to me most  enchanting.    Every yard we advanced new beauties of scenery were revealed to view.  The richness of the tropical vegetation seemed in this place to  culminate, it was so rank and gorgeous.  The day was fine, too, and all  the strange-looking creatures--ugly and beautiful, large and small--  peculiar to those regions, seemed to have resolved on a general peace in  order to bask in the sunshine and enjoy the glorious weather.  Man alone  was bent on war, and our track, alas! was marked with blood wherever we  passed along.  I pondered much on this subject, and wondered at the  bloodthirsty spirit which seems to be natural to man in all conditions  and climes.  Then I thought of the difficulty these poor Africans have  at times in procuring food, the frequency with which they are reduced  almost to a state of starvation, and I ceased to wonder that they shot  and speared everything that came in their way.    We proceeded up the left bank of the river, keeping close in to the  shore in order to obtain the protection of the overhanging boughs and  foliage; for the sun soon began to grow hot, and in the middle of the  day became so intense that I sometimes feared that I or my companions  would receive a sunstroke.  I confess that the subject of health often  caused me much anxiety; for although I knew that we were all old  experienced travellers--though young in years--and had become in a great  degree inured to hardships, I feared that the deadly climate of Central  Africa might prove too much for our European constitutions.  By the free  use of quinine, however, and careful attention to the roles of health as  far as circumstances would permit, we were fortunate enough to keep in  excellent health and spirits during the whole course of our sojourn  there; for which, when I thought of the hundreds of Europeans who had  perished on that deadly coast without even venturing into the interior,  I felt very thankful.  One of our chief delights, to which I in a great  degree attribute our uninterrupted health, was bathing daily in the  streams and ponds with which we fell in, or on which we paddled during  our travels.  On these occasions we were fain, however, to be exceeding  careful in the selection of our bathing-pool, as crocodiles and  alligators, and I know not what other hideous animals, were constantly  on the lookout for prey, and I make no doubt would have been very ready  to try the flavour of a morsel of English food had we given them the  chance.    On these occasions, when we had made sure of our pool, we were wont to  paddle about in the cool refreshing stream, and recall to mind the  splendid dips we had had together six years before in the clear waters  of the coral island.  Since that time Peterkin had learned to swim well,  which was not only a source of much satisfaction and gratification to  himself now, but, he told me, had been the means of preserving not only  his own life on more than one occasion, but the life of a little child  which he had the good fortune to rescue from drowning when cruising off  the island of Madagascar.    Peterkin used to speak very strongly when talking on this subject, and I  observed, from the unusual seriousness of his manner, that he felt  deeply too.    \"Ralph,\" he said to me one day, \"half the world is mad--I am not sure  that I might not say three-quarters of the world is mad--and I'm quite  certain that all the _ladies_ in the world are mad with the exception of  the brown ladies of the South Seas, and a few rare specimens elsewhere;  they're all mad together in reference to the matter of swimming.  Now  that I have learned it nothing is so easy, and any one who is not as  blind as a rheumatic owl must see that nothing is more important; for  every one almost is subject to being pitched now and then into deep  water, and if he can't swim it's all up with him.  Why, every time an  angler goes out to _fish_ he runs the chance of slipping and being swept  into a deep hole, where, if he cannot swim, he is certain to be drowned.  And yet five strokes would save his life.  _Good_ swimming is by no  means what is wanted; swimming of any kind, however poor, is all that is  desiderated.  Every time a lady goes to have a row on a lake she is  liable to be upset by the clumsiness of those who accompany her, and  although it may be close to shore, if she cannot swim, down she goes to  the bottom.  And _floating_ won't do.  Some ladies delude themselves  with the idea that floating is of great value.  In nine cases out of ten  it is of no value at all; for unless water be perfectly smooth and  still, a person cannot float so as to keep the waves from washing over  the face, in which case choking is the certain result.  There is no  excuse for not learning to swim.  In most large cities there are  swimming-baths; if the sea is not available, a river is, everywhere.  I  tell you what it is, Ralph: people who don't learn to swim are--are--I  was going to say asses, but that would be an insult to the much-maligned  long-eared animal; and parents who don't teach their offspring to swim  deserve to be drowned in butter-milk; and I wish I saw--no, I _don't_  quite wish I saw them all drowned in that way, but I do wish that I  could impress upon mankind over the length and breadth of this rotund  world the great, the immense, the intense importance of boys _and girls_  being taught to swim.\"    \"You make use of strong language,\" said I.    \"Quite a powerful orator,\" added Jack, laughing.    \"Bah!\" exclaimed Peterkin; \"your reception of this grand truth is but a  type of the manner in which it will be received by the pig-headed world.  What's the use of preaching common sense?  I'm a perfect donkey!\"    \"Nay, Peterkin,\" said Jack; \"I appreciate what you say, and have no  doubt whatever that your remarks, if made public, would create quite a  revolution in the juvenile world, and convert them speedily into aquatic  animals.  Did you ever think of sending your views on that subject to  the _Times_?\"    \"The _Times_!\" cried Peterkin.    \"Yes, the _Times_; why not?\"    \"Because,\" said Peterkin slowly, \"I once sent a letter to that great but  insolent periodical, and what do you think it did?\"    \"Can't tell, I'm sure.\"    \"_Took no notice of it whatever_!\" said Peterkin, with a look of  ineffable disgust.    But to return from this digression.  I was much struck with the splendid  contrast of colours that met my eye everywhere here.  The rich variety  of greens in the different trees harmonised with the bright pink plums  and scarlet berries, and these latter were almost dimmed in their lustre  by the bright plumage of the birds, which I felt intense longing to  procure, many of them being quite new to me, and, I am certain, totally  unknown to naturalists, while others I recognised with delight as  belonging to several of the species of which I had read in  ornithological works.  I tried hard to shoot several of these lovely  creatures, intending to stuff them, but, to my regret, was utterly  unable to hit them.  Seeing this, Peterkin took pity on me, and sitting  down in the bow of our canoe, picked off all the birds I pointed out to  him as we passed, with unerring precision.  Most of them fell into the  water, and were easily secured, while one or two toppled off the  branches into the canoe.  Several of them he shot on the wing--a feat  which even filled Jack with surprise, and so astounded the natives that  they surrounded our canoe at last, and gazed open-mouthed at my friend,  whom they evidently regarded as the greatest fetishman that had ever  come amongst them.    He was obliged to stop at last and lay down his gun in order to make the  natives cease from crowding round us and delaying our voyage.  A number  of iguanas were observed on the branches of the trees that overhung the  stream.  They dropped into the water as we approached; but the natives  succeeded in spearing a good many, and I afterwards found that they  considered them excellent food.    If I was charmed with the birds, Peterkin was no less delighted with the  monkeys that chattered at us as we passed along.  I never saw a man  laugh as he did that day.  He almost became hysterical, so much was he  tickled with their antics; and the natives, who have a keen sense of the  ludicrous, seemed quite to sympathise with his spirit, although, of  course, what amused him could not have similarly affected them, seeing  that they were used to monkeys from infancy.    \"There's something new!\" exclaimed Jack, as we rounded a bend in the  river and came in view of an open flat where it assumed somewhat the  aspect of a pond or small lake.  He pointed to a flock of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2176"],[0,"Seven Discourses on Art (#11)"],[1,"Lorraine seldom, if ever, availed himself of those  accidents; either he thought that such peculiarities were contrary to  that style of general nature which he professed, or that it would catch  the attention too strongly, and destroy that quietness and repose which  he thought necessary to that kind of painting.    A portrait painter likewise, when he attempts history, unless he is upon  his guard, is likely to enter too much into the detail.  He too  frequently makes his historical heads look like portraits; and this was  once the custom amongst those old painters who revived the art before  general ideas were practised or understood.  A history painter paints man  in general; a portrait painter, a particular man, and consequently a  defective model.    Thus an habitual practice in the lower exercises of the art will prevent  many from attaining the greater.  But such of us who move in these  humbler walks of the profession are not ignorant that, as the natural  dignity of the subject is less, the more all the little ornamental helps  are necessary to its embellishment.  It would be ridiculous for a painter  of domestic scenes, of portraits, landscapes, animals, or of still life,  to say that he despised those qualities which have made the subordinate  schools so famous.  The art of colouring, and the skilful management of  light and shadow, are essential requisites in his confined labours.  If  we descend still lower, what is the painter of fruit and flowers without  the utmost art in colouring, and what the painters call handling; that  is, a lightness of pencil that implies great practice, and gives the  appearance of being done with ease?  Some here, I believe, must remember  a flower-painter whose boast it was that he scorned to paint for the  million; no, he professed to paint in the true Italian taste; and  despising the crowd, called strenuously upon the few to admire him.  His  idea of the Italian taste was to paint as black and dirty as he could,  and to leave all clearness and brilliancy of colouring to those who were  fonder of money than of immortality.  The consequence was such as might  be expected.  For these pretty excellences are here essential beauties;  and without this merit the artist's work will be more short-lived than  the objects of his imitation.    From what has been advanced, we must now be convinced that there are two  distinct styles in history painting: the grand, and the splendid or  ornamental.    The great style stands alone, and does not require, perhaps does not so  well admit, any addition from inferior beauties.  The ornamental style  also possesses its own peculiar merit.  However, though the union of the  two may make a sort of composite style, yet that style is likely to be  more imperfect than either of those which go to its composition.  Both  kinds have merit, and may be excellent though in different ranks, if  uniformity be preserved, and the general and particular ideas of nature  be not mixed.  Even the meanest of them is difficult enough to attain;  and the first place being already occupied by the great artists in either  department, some of those who followed thought there was less room for  them, and feeling the impulse of ambition and the desire of novelty, and  being at the same time perhaps willing to take the shortest way, they  endeavoured to make for themselves a place between both.  This they have  effected by forming a union of the different orders.  But as the grave  and majestic style would suffer by a union with the florid and gay, so  also has the Venetian ornament in some respect been injured by attempting  an alliance with simplicity.    It may be asserted that the great style is always more or less  contaminated by any meaner mixture.  But it happens in a few instances  that the lower may be improved by borrowing from the grand.  Thus, if a  portrait painter is desirous to raise and improve his subject, he has no  other means than by approaching it to a general idea.  He leaves out all  the minute breaks and peculiarities in the face, and changes the dress  from a temporary fashion to one more permanent, which has annexed to it  no ideas of meanness from its being familiar to us.  But if an exact  resemblance of an individual be considered as the sole object to be aimed  at, the portrait painter will be apt to lose more than he gains by the  acquired dignity taken from general nature.  It is very difficult to  ennoble the character of a countenance but at the expense of the  likeness, which is what is most generally required by such as sit to the  painter.    Of those who have practised the composite style, and have succeeded in  this perilous attempt, perhaps the foremost is Correggio.  His style is  founded upon modern grace and elegance, to which is super, added  something of the simplicity of the grand style.  A breadth of light and  colour, the general ideas of the drapery, an uninterrupted flow of  outline, all conspire to this effect.  Next him (perhaps equal to him)  Parmegiano has dignified the genteelness of modern effeminacy by uniting  it with the simplicity of the ancients and the grandeur and severity of  Michael Angelo.  It must be confessed, however, that these two  extraordinary men, by endeavouring to give the utmost degree of grace,  have sometimes, perhaps, exceeded its boundaries, and have fallen into  the most hateful of all hateful qualities, affectation.  Indeed, it is  the peculiar characteristic of men of genius to be afraid of coldness and  insipidity, from which they think they never can be too far removed.  It  particularly happens to these great masters of grace and elegance.  They  often boldly drive on to the very verge of ridicule; the spectator is  alarmed, but at the same time admires their vigour and intrepidity.       Strange graces still, and stranger flights they had,     . . .     Yet ne'er so sure our passion to create     Ae when they touch'd the brink of all we hate.    The errors of genius, however, are pardonable, and none even of the more  exalted painters are wholly free from them; but they have taught us, by  the rectitude of their general practice, to correct their own affected or  accidental deviation.  The very first have not been always upon their  guard, and perhaps there is not a fault but what may take shelter under  the most venerable authorities; yet that style only is perfect in which  the noblest principles are uniformly pursued; and those masters only are  entitled to the first rank in, our estimation who have enlarged the  boundaries of their art, and have raised it to its highest dignity, by  exhibiting the general ideas of nature.    On the whole, it seems to me that there is but one presiding principle  which regulates and gives stability to every art.  The works, whether of  poets, painters, moralists, or historians, which are built upon general  nature, live for ever; while those which depend for their existence on  particular customs and habits, a partial view of nature, or the  fluctuation of fashion, can only be coeval with that which first raised  them from obscurity.  Present time and future maybe considered as rivals,  and he who solicits the one must expect to be discountenanced by the  other.        A DISCOURSE  Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy on the Distribution of the  Prizes, December 10, 1772, by the President.      Gentlemen,--I purpose to carry on in this discourse the subject which I  began in my last.  It was my wish upon that occasion to incite you to  pursue the higher excellences of the art.  But I fear that in this  particular I have been misunderstood.  Some are ready to imagine, when  any of their favourite acquirements in the art are properly classed, that  they are utterly disgraced.  This is a very great mistake: nothing has  its proper lustre but in its proper place.  That which is most worthy of  esteem in its allotted sphere becomes an object, not of respect, but of  derision, when it is forced into a higher, to which it is not suited; and  there it becomes doubly a source of disorder, by occupying a situation  which is not natural to it, and by putting down from the first place what  is in reality of too much magnitude to become with grace and proportion  that subordinate station, to which something of less value would be much  better suited.    My advice in a word is this: keep your principal attention fixed upon the  higher excellences.  If you compass them and compass nothing more, you  are still in the first class.  We may regret the innumerable beauties  which you may want: you may be very imperfect: but still, you are an  imperfect person of the highest order.    If, when you have got thus far, you can add any, or all, of the  subordinate qualifications, it is my wish and advice that you should not  neglect them.    But this is as much a matter of circumspection and caution at least as of  eagerness and pursuit.    The mind is apt to be distracted by a multiplicity of pursuits; and that  scale of perfection, which I wish always to be preserved, is in the  greatest danger of being totally disordered, and even inverted.    Some excellences bear to be united, and are improved by union, others are  of a discordant nature; and the attempt to join them only produces a  harsher jarring of incongruent principles.    The attempt to unite contrary excellences (of form, for instance) in a  single figure, can never escape degenerating into the monstrous, but by  sinking into the insipid, taking away its marked character, and weakening  its expression.    This remark is true to a certain degree with regard to the passions.  If  you mean to preserve the most perfect beauty in its most perfect state,  you cannot express the passions, which produce (all of them) distortion  and deformity, more or less, in the most beautiful faces.
