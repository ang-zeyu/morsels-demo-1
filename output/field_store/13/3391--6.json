The figure shows the  fibre ruptured, in order to display the sarcolemma; e.p. is the end  plate of a nerve (n.v.), and fb. are the fibrillae into which a fibre  may be teased.      Section 98. In the heart we have an intermediate kind of muscle  cardiac muscle (Figure 2), in which the muscle fibres branch; there  is apparently no sarcolemma, and the undivided nuclei lie in the  centre of the cell.      Section 99. Unstriated muscle is sometimes called involuntary, and  striated, voluntary muscle; but there is really not the connexion with  the will that these terms suggest. We have just mentioned that the  heart-muscle is striated, but who can alter the beating of the heart  by force of will? And the striated muscles of the limbs perform,  endless involuntary acts. It would seem that unstriated muscle  contracts slowly, and we find it especially among the viscera; in the  intestine for instance, where it controls that \"peristaltic\" movement  which pushes the food forward. Voluntary muscle, on the other hand,  has a sharp contraction. The muscle of the slow-moving snails, slugs,  and mussels is unstriated; all the muscle of the active insects and  crustacea (crabs, lobsters, and crayfish) is striated. Still if the student  bears the exception of the heart in mind, and considers muscles as  \"voluntary\" that his will can reach, the terms voluntary and involuntary  will serve to give him an idea of the distribution of these two types of  muscle in his own body, and in that of the rabbit.      Section 100. Muscular contraction, and generally all activity in the  body is accompanied by kataboly. The medium by which these  katabolic changes are set going and controlled is the nervous  system. The nervous system holds the whole body together in one  harmonious whole; it is the governing organization of the multicellular  community (Section 55), and the supreme head of the government  resides in the brain, and is called the mind. But just as in a political  state only the most important and most exceptional duties are  performed by the imperial body, and minor matters and questions of  routine are referred to boards and local authorities, so the mind  takes cognisance only of a few of the higher concerns of the animal,  and a large amount of the work of the nervous system goes on  insensibly, in a perfectly automatic way-- even much that occurs in  the brain.      Section 101. The primary elements in the tissue of the nervous  system are three; nerve fibres, which are simply conducting threads,  telegraph wires; ganglion cells, which are the officials of the system;  and neuroglia, a fine variety of connective tissue which holds these  other elements together, and may also possibly exercise a function in  affecting impressions. A message along a nerve to a ganglion cell is  an afferent impression, from a cell to a muscle or other external end  is an efferent impression. The passage of an impression may be  defined as a flash of kataboly along the nerve, and so every feeling,  thought, and determination involves the formation of a certain  quantity of katastases, and the necessity for air and nutrition.      Section 102. Unlike telegraph wires, to which they are often  compared, nervous fibres usually convey impressions only in one  direction, either centrally (afferent or sensory nerve fibres), or  outwardly (efferent or motor nerve fibres). But the so-called motor  nerve fibres include not only those that set muscles in motion, but  those that excite secretion, check impulsive movements, and govern  nutrition.      Section 103. Figure 7, Sheet 8, shows the typical structure of nervous  tissues. The nerve fibres there figured are bound together by  endoneurium into small ropes, the nerves, encased in perineurium.  There is always a grey axis cylinder (a.c.), which may (in medullated  nerves), or may not (in non-medullated or grey nerves) have a  medullary sheath (s.S.) interrupted at intervals by the nodes of  Ranvier (n.R.). Nuclei (n.) at intervals under the sheath indicate the  cells from which nerve fibres are derived by a process of elongation.  The nerves of invertebrata, where they possess nerves, are mostly  grey, and so are those of the sympathetic system of vertebrata, to  be presently described, g.c., g.c. are ganglion cells; they may have  many hair-like processes, usually running into continuity with  the axis cylinders of nerve fibres, in which case they are called  multi-polar cells, or they may be uni- or bi-polar.      Section 104. The simplest example of the action of the nervous  system is reflex action. For instance, when the foot of a frog, or the  hand of a soundly sleeping person, is tickled very gently, the limb is  moved away from the irritation, without any mental action, and entirely  without will being exercised. And when we go from light into darkness,  the pupil of the eye enlarges, without any direct consciousness of the  change of its shape on our part. Similarly, the presence or food in the  pharynx initiates a series of movements-- swallowing, the digestive  movements, and so on-- which in health are entirely beyond our  mental scope.      Section 105. A vast amount of our activities are reflex, and in such  action an efferent stimulus follows an afferent promptly and quite  mechanically. It is only where efferent stimuli do not immediately  become entirely transmuted into outwardly moving impulses that  mental action comes in and an animal feels. There appears to be a  direct relation between sensation and motion. For instance, the  shrieks and other instinctive violent motions produced by pain,  \"shunt off\" a certain amount of nervous impression that would  otherwise register itself as additional painful sensation. Similarly most  women and children understand the comfort of a \"good cry,\" and its  benefit in shifting off a disagreeable mental state.      Section 106. The mind receives and stores impressions, and these  accumulated experiences are the basis of memory, comparison,  imagination, thought, and apparently spontaneous will. Voluntary  actions differ from reflex by the interposition of this previously stored  factor. For instance, when a frog sees a small object in front of him,  that may or may not be an edible insect, the direct visual impression  does not directly determine his subsequent action. It revives a number  of previous experiences, an image already stored of similar insects  and associated with painful or pleasurable gustatory experiences.  With these arise an emotional effect of desire or repulsion which,  passes into action of capture or the reverse.      Section 107. Voluntary actions may, by constant repetition, become  quasi-reflex in character. The intellectual phase is abbreviated away.  Habits are once voluntary and deliberated actions becoming  mechanical in this way, and slipping out of the sphere of mind. For  instance, many of the detailed movements of writing and walking  are performed without any attention to the details. An excessive  concentration of the attention upon one thing leads to  absent-mindedness, and to its consequent absurdities of  inappropriate, because imperfectly acquired, reflexes.      Section 108. This fluctuating scope of mind should be remembered,  more especially when we are considering the probable mental states  of the lower animals. An habitual or reflex action may have all the  outward appearance of deliberate adjustment. We cannot tell in any  particular case how far the mental comes in, or whether it comes in at  all. Seeing that in our own case consciousness does not enter  into our commonest and most necessary actions, into breathing and  digestion, for instance, and scarcely at all in the details of such acts  as walking and talking we might infer that nature was economical in  its use, and that in the case of such an animal as the Rabbit, which  follows a very limited routine, and in which scarcely any versatility in  emergencies is evident, it must be relatively inconsiderable. Perhaps  after all, pain is not scattered so needlessly and lavishly throughout  the world as the enemies of the vivisectionist would have us believe.        7. _The Nervous System_    Section 109. A little more attention must now be given to the  detailed anatomy of the peripheral and central nerve ends. A nerve, as  we have pointed out, terminates centrally in some ganglion cell, either  in a ganglion or in the spinal cord or brain; peripherally there is a  much greater variety of ending. We may have tactile (touch) ends  of various kinds, and the similar olfactory and gustatory end organs;  or the nerve may conduct efferent impressions, and terminate in a  gland which it excites to secretion, in a muscle end-plate, or in fact,  anywhere, where kataboly can be set going and energy disengaged.  We may now briefly advert to the receptive nerve ends.      Section 110. Many sensory nerves, doubtless, terminate in fine ends  among the tissues. There are also special touch corpuscles, ovoid  bodies, around which a nerve twines, or within which it terminates.      Section 111. The eye (Figure 8) has a tough, dense, outer coat, the  sclerotic (sc.), within which is a highly vascular and internally  pigmented layer, the choroid, upon which the percipient nervous layer,  the retina (r.) rests. The chief chamber of the eye is filled with  a transparent jelly, the vitreous humour (v.h.). In front of the eye, the  white sclerotic passes into the transparent cornea (c.). The  epidermis is continued over the outer face of this as a thin,  transparent epithelium. The choroid coat is continued in front by a  ring-shaped muscle, the iris (ir.) the coloured portion of the eyes. This  iris enlarges or contracts its central aperture (the black pupil)  by reflex action, as the amount of light diminishes or increases.
