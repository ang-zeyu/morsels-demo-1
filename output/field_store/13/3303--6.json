Uncle  William and Aunt Adelaide also beg little Victoria to give dear Mamma  and to dear Sissi[2] a kiss in their name, and to Aunt Augusta,[3]  Aunt Mary[4] and Aunt Sophia[5] too, and also to the _big Doll_. Uncle  William and Aunt Adelaide are very sorry to be absent on that day and  not to see their _dear, dear_ little Victoria, as they are sure she  will be very good and obedient to dear Mamma on that day, and on many,  many others. They also hope that dear little Victoria will not forget  them and know them again when Uncle and Aunt return.    To dear little Xandrina Victoria.

I see my Aunt Sophia[6] often, who looks very well,  and is very well. I use every day your pretty soup-basin. Is it very  warm in Italy? It is so mild here, that I go out every day. Mama is  tolerable well and am quite well. Your affectionate Niece,    VICTORIA.    _P.S._--I am very angry with you, Uncle, for you have never written to  me once since you went, and that is a long while.        [Footnote 6: Princess Sophia, daughter of George III.]          _Prince Leopold_[7] _to the Princess Victoria._    PARIS, _20th April 1829._    MY DEAREST LOVE,--Though in a few days I hope to have the happiness  of seeing you, still I wish to recall myself even before that time to  your recollection, and to tell you how delighted I shall be to embrace  my dearest little child. I have travelled far over the world and shall  be able to give you some curious information about various matters.    Stockmar, who was very ill, and whom I despaired of seeing here, did  arrive before yesterday,[8] and you may guess what pleasure it gave  me. Now I will conclude; _au revoir_, and let me find you grown,  blooming, and kind to your old and faithful Uncle,    LEOPOLD.        [Footnote 7: Afterwards King of the Belgians.]        [Footnote 8: I.e. _avant hier_.]          [Pageheading: BIRTHDAY LETTERS]      _The Princess Hohenlohe[9] to the Princess Victoria._    [_May 1829._]    If I had wings and could fly like a bird, I should fly in at your  window like the little robin to-day, and wish you many very happy  returns of the 24th, and tell you how I love you, dearest sister, and  how often I think of you and long to see you. I think if I were once  with you again I could not leave you so soon. I should wish to stay  with you, and what would poor Ernest[9] say if I were to leave him so  long? He would perhaps try to fly after me, but I fear he would not  get far; he is rather tall and heavy for flying. So you see I have  nothing left to do but to write to you, and wish you in this way all  possible happiness and joy for this and many, many years to come. I  hope you will spend a very merry birthday. How I wish to be with you,  dearest Victoire, on that day!    I have not thanked you, I believe, for a very dear letter you have  written to me, which gave me the greatest pleasure. Your descriptions  of the plays you had seen amused me very much. I wish I had seen your  performance too. Your most affectionate Sister,    FEODORE.        [Footnote 9: The Princess Feodore of Leiningen, the Queen's      half-sister, had married, in January 1828, the Prince (Ernest)      of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.]          _The Duchess of Clarence to the Princess Victoria._    BUSHEY PARK, _14th August 1829._    A thousand thanks to you, dear Victoria, for your very nice and  well-written letter full of good wishes, which I had the pleasure to  receive yesterday; and many thanks more for the pretty gifts your dear  Mamma has sent me in your name. I wore them last night for your sake,  dearest child, and thought of you _very often_.    It gives me great satisfaction to hear that you are enjoying the sea  air and like the place which you now occupy. I wish I could pay your  Mamma a visit there and see you again, my dear little niece, for I  long to have that pleasure, and must resign myself at being deprived  of it some time longer. Your Uncle desires to be most kindly  remembered to you, and hopes to receive soon also a letter from you,  of whom he is as fond as I am. We speak of you very often, and trust  that you will always consider us to be amongst your best friends....    God bless you, my dear Victoria, is always the prayer of your most  truly affectionate Aunt,    ADELAIDE.          _The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._    BRUSSELS, _22nd May 1832._    MY DEAREST LOVE,--Let me offer you my _sincerest_ and _best_ wishes on  the return of the anniversary of your birthday. May heaven protect and  prosper you, and shower all its best blessings on you.    Time flies: it is now thirteen years that you came into the world  of trouble; I therefore can hardly venture to call you any longer a  little Princess.    This will make you feel, my dear Love, that you must give your  attention more and more to graver matters. By the dispensation of  Providence you are destined to fill a most eminent station; to fill  it _well_ must now become your study. A good heart and a trusty and  honourable character are amongst the most indispensable qualifications  for that position.    You will always find in your Uncle that faithful friend which he  has proved to you from your earliest infancy, and whenever you feel  yourself in want of support or advice, call on him with perfect  confidence.    If circumstances permitted my leaving Ostend early to-morrow morning,  I should be able to place myself my birthday present into your fair  hair; as this happiness has not fallen to my lot, your excellent  mother has promised to act as my representative.    You will probably have little time to spare. I therefore conclude with  the assurance of the sincere attachment and affection with which I  shall ever be, my dearest Love, your faithful and devoted Friend and  Uncle,    LEOPOLD R.          [Pageheading: THE QUEEN OF THE BELGIANS]      _The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._    LAEKEN,[10] _31st August 1832._    MY DEAREST LOVE,--You told me you wished to have a description of your  new Aunt.[11] I therefore shall both mentally and physically describe  her to you.    She is extremely gentle and amiable, her actions are always guided by  principles. She is at all times ready and disposed to sacrifice her  comfort and inclinations to see others happy. She values goodness,  merit, and virtue much more than beauty, riches, and amusements. With  all this she is highly informed and very clever; she speaks and writes  English, German and Italian; she speaks English very well indeed.  In short, my dear Love, you see that I may well recommend her as an  example for all young ladies, being Princesses or not.    Now to her appearance. She is about Feodore's height, her hair  very fair, light blue eyes, of a very gentle, intelligent and kind  expression. A Bourbon nose and small mouth. The figure is much like  Feodore's but rather less stout. She rides very well, which she proved  to my great alarm the other day, by keeping her seat though a horse of  mine ran away with her full speed for at least half a mile. What she  does particularly well is dancing. Music unfortunately she is not  very fond of, though she plays on the harp; I believe there is some  idleness in the case. There exists already great confidence and  affection between us; she is desirous of doing everything that can  contribute to my happiness, and I study whatever can make her happy  and contented.    You will see by these descriptions that though my good little wife is  not the tallest Queen, she is a very great prize which I highly value  and cherish....    Now it is time I should finish my letter. Say everything that is kind  to good Lehzen, and believe me ever, my dearest Love, your faithful  Friend and Uncle,    LEOPOLD R.
