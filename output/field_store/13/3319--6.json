I transmit to your Excellency herewith a copy of an instruction  which I addressed on the 19th instant to Sir Stratford Canning, in  reply to his Excellency's despatch of the 10th of February last  relative to the execution of the Greek near Brussa, a copy of which  was forwarded to your Excellency on the 15th instant.    You will lose no time in communicating this instruction to M. Guizot  and you will at the same time, suggest to him the propriety of  instructing the French Minister at the Porte to make it perfectly  clear to the Turkish Government, that neither Great Britain nor  France demand the abrogation of any law of the Turkish Empire; and  that all that we desire is an assurance that the practice which has  so justly called forth the reprobation of all Christian countries,  shall cease, by the law being suffered to remain, as it had long  been, dormant.

I applied to Rifaat Pasha on the 24th instant, in concert with the  French Minister, for an answer to your Lordship's requisition on the  subject of the executions for apostacy from Islamism. My application  was made in the form of an instruction to M. Frederick Pisani, and  Baron de Bourqueney adopted a similar line of proceeding. Copies of  my instruction to M. Pisani and of his report of Rifaat Pasha's  reply, identical with the report of the French interpreter, are  inclosed herewith for your Lordship's more complete information.    Several Councils have been held, as well at the Porte as at the  Sheik-ul-Islam's residence.    I inclose with this despatch a short report from M. Pisani, which  preceded the instruction referred to above.    Inclosure l in No. 30.    _Sir Stratford Canning to M. Pisani_.    Monsieur,                         _Péra, le_ 22 _Février_, 1844.    Le message que vous m'avez transmis avant-hier de la part de son  Excellence Rifaat Pacha, laisse tout-à-fait incertaine l'époque où  je recevrai une réponse à la communication importante que j'ai eu  l'honneur de lui faire le 8 du courant par l'ordre exprès de ma  Cour. Il est pourtant à désirer que cette incertitude ne soit pas  prolongée hors de mesure. La question dont il s'agit est toute  entière dans la dépêche officielle dont la copie se trouve depuis  quinze jours entre les mains du Ministre, et j'attends du  Gouvernement Ottoman la prompte solution d'une affaire qui touche de  trop près ses intérêts, son avenir, et ses rapports avec les  Puissances amies, pour que son Excellence soit autorisée à la  regarder comme purement du ressort de la religion.    Il me semble, au contraire, que cette question est, à ne pas en  douter, essentiellement liée avec les considérations les plus  élevées de la politique. J'aime par conséquent à croire que les  Ministres de Sa Hautesse ne méconnaîtront pas leur obligation d'en  mesurer la portée par les principes de la raison et les règles de la  prudence dont aucun Etat ne pourrait impunément se dispenser. Eviter  la responsabilité qui appartient nécessairement à leur position  serait-ce en effet autre chose que priver leur Souverain du gage le  plus sûr de leur exactitude à en remplir les conditions conformément  au but de leur nomination, aux exigeances de la conjoncture, et aux  inspirations de la sagacité que la Providence leur a accordée?    Je vous invite donc, Monsieur, à vous rendre de nouveau auprès du  Ministre des Affaires Etrangères, et à exprimer formellement à son  Excellence ma juste attente que le Conseil ne tardera pas à me faire  remettre par son canal une réponse catégorique et comme je l'espère,  satisfaisante à la demande d'un Gouvernement sincèrement ami de la  Porte. Vous lui laisserez une copie de cette instruction, et vous  vous entendrez quant au temps de sa présentation avec Monsieur  l'Interprète de l'Ambassade Française, qui est muni d'une  instruction pareille par son Ministre.    Je suis, &c.,    (Signé) STRATFORD CANNING.    (Translation.)    Sir,                              _Pera, February_ 22, 1844.    The message which you yesterday conveyed to me from his Excellency  Rifaat Pasha leaves altogether uncertain the time at which I shall  receive an answer to the important communication which I had the  honour to make to him on the 8th instant by the express order of my  Court. It is however to be desired that this uncertainty should not  indefinitely be prolonged. The question at issue is altogether  contained in the official despatch the copy of which has been for  the last fortnight in the Minister's hands, and I expect from the  Ottoman Government the speedy settlement of a matter which affects  its interests, its future position, and its relations with friendly  Powers too nearly for his Excellency to be authorized in considering  it merely as a religious question.    On the contrary it appears to me that without doubt this question is  essentially connected with the highest political considerations. I  am consequently fain to believe that the Ministers of His Highness  will not overlook their obligation to estimate the bearing of it by  the principles of reason and the rules of prudence which no State  can with impunity disregard. To shrink from the responsibility which  necessarily attaches to their position, what else would that be than  to deprive their Sovereign of the surest pledge of their diligence  in discharging the conditions thereof consistently with the object  of their appointment, the emergencies of the state of affairs, and  the inspirations of the sagacity which Providence has bestowed upon  them?    I accordingly request you, Sir, to go again to the Minister for  Foreign Affairs, and formally to intimate to his Excellency my just  expectation that the Council will not delay to cause to be delivered  to me through him a categorical answer, and, as I hope, a  satisfactory answer to the demand of a Government sincerely friendly  to the Porte. You will leave with him a copy of this instruction,  and you will concert as to the time of its delivery with the  Interpreter of the French Embassy, who is furnished by his Minister  with a similar instruction.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) STRATFORD CANNING.    Inclosure 2 in No. 30.    _Answer of Rifaat Pasha to M. Pisani, February_ 22, 1844.    Aucune nouvelle démarche n'était nécessaire pour nous faire sentir  l'importance de cette question, importance dont nous sommes  profondément pénétrés. Nous la traitons avec tout le sérieux et tous  les soins que sa gravité exige. Oui, ce que vos chefs respectifs  disent est vrai; cette question a son côté politique aussi bien que  son côté religieux. Il faut en effet que nous nous séparions de la  nation, ou bien des Puissances Chrétiennes; ce sont là deux grands  maux également à éviter. Le Sultan a ordonné que cette question soit  discutée dans un Conseil d'Oulémas qui s'ouvrira Samedi prochain  chez le Sheik-ul-Islam, auquel seront appelés le Cazi-Asker et  d'autres notabilités parmi les hommes de loi; après quoi, le Conseil  des Ministres s'en occupera de nouveau. Ne croyez-pas au reste que  nous nous soyons bornés à appeler leur attention purement et  simplement sur la question sous le rapport religieux; nous leur  avons remis aussi les protocoles des conférences, les dépêches des  deux Gouvernemens, et même des extraits des journaux qui ont agité  cette question, et nous leur communiquerons également les  instructions que vous venez de me remettre, et qui, bien que  superflues pour la Porte, peuvent encore ajouter à l'impression  produite par les autres pièces qui sont entre leurs mains. Comme  nous ne devons pas douter des bonnes intentions des Puissances, nous  espérons que MM. les Représentans d'Angleterre et de France, dans  leur haute sagesse et avec l'esprit d'équité qui les anime, ne se  refuseront pas à prendre en considération les graves difficultés qui  existent, et qu'ils se prêteront à amener une solution qui nous  sauverait des deux maux que je vous ai signalés. C'est là le but que  nous devons nous efforcer d'atteindre.    C'était pour vous informer de la marche de cette affaire que je vous  ai prié ce matin de passer chez moi.    (Translation.)    No fresh step was requisite to make us sensible of the importance of  this question, with which we are deeply impressed. We are dealing  with it with all the seriousness and all the care which its gravity  requires. Yes, what your respective chiefs say is true; this  question has its political as also its religious side. It is  requisite, in fact, that we should separate ourselves from the  nation, or otherwise from the Christian Powers; those are two great  evils to be equally avoided. The Sultan has commanded that this  question shall be discussed in the Council of Oulemas which will be  opened next Saturday at the Sheik-ul-Islam's, to which the  Cazi-Asker and the other principal persons among the men of the law  will be summoned; after which, the Council of Ministers will again  apply themselves to it. Do not suppose, however, that we have  confined ourselves to directing their attention purely and simply to  the question as it regards religion; we have likewise submitted to  them the protocols of the conferences, the despatches of the two  Governments, and even the extracts of the newspapers which have  discussed this question, and we shall likewise"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2040"],[0,"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (#11)"],[1," was constantly in a state of  intoxication from opium.  Now the accusation, said I, is not _prima  facie_ and of necessity an absurd one; but the defence _is_.  To my  surprise, however, he insisted that both his enemies and his friends were  in the right.  \"I will maintain,\" said he, \"that I _do_ talk nonsense;  and secondly, I will maintain that I do not talk nonsense upon principle,  or with any view to profit, but solely and simply, said he, solely and  simply--solely and simply (repeating it three times over), because I am  drunk with opium, and _that_ daily.\"  I replied that, as to the  allegation of his enemies, as it seemed to be established upon such  respectable testimony, seeing that the three parties concerned all agree  in it, it did not become me to question it; but the defence set up I must  demur to.  He proceeded to discuss the matter, and to lay down his  reasons; but it seemed to me so impolite to pursue an argument which must  have presumed a man mistaken in a point belonging to his own profession,  that I did not press him even when his course of argument seemed open to  objection; not to mention that a man who talks nonsense, even though  \"with no view to profit,\" is not altogether the most agreeable partner in  a dispute, whether as opponent or respondent.  I confess, however, that  the authority of a surgeon, and one who was reputed a good one, may seem  a weighty one to my prejudice; but still I must plead my experience,  which was greater than his greatest by 7,000 drops a-day; and though it  was not possible to suppose a medical man unacquainted with the  characteristic symptoms of vinous intoxication, it yet struck me that he  might proceed on a logical error of using the word intoxication with too  great latitude, and extending it generically to all modes of nervous  excitement, instead of restricting it as the expression for a specific  sort of excitement connected with certain diagnostics.  Some people have  maintained in my hearing that they had been drunk upon green tea; and a  medical student in London, for whose knowledge in his profession I have  reason to feel great respect, assured me the other day that a patient in  recovering from an illness had got drunk on a beef-steak.    Having dwelt so much on this first and leading error in respect to opium,  I shall notice very briefly a second and a third, which are, that the  elevation of spirits produced by opium is necessarily followed by a  proportionate depression, and that the natural and even immediate  consequence of opium is torpor and stagnation, animal and mental.  The  first of these errors I shall content myself with simply denying;  assuring my reader that for ten years, during which I took opium at  intervals, the day succeeding to that on which I allowed myself this  luxury was always a day of unusually good spirits.    With respect to the torpor supposed to follow, or rather (if we were to  credit the numerous pictures of Turkish opium-eaters) to accompany the  practice of opium-eating, I deny that also.  Certainly opium is classed  under the head of narcotics, and some such effect it may produce in the  end; but the primary effects of opium are always, and in the highest  degree, to excite and stimulate the system.  This first stage of its  action always lasted with me, during my noviciate, for upwards of eight  hours; so that it must be the fault of the opium-eater himself if he does  not so time his exhibition of the dose (to speak medically) as that the  whole weight of its narcotic influence may descend upon his sleep.  Turkish opium-eaters, it seems, are absurd enough to sit, like so many  equestrian statues, on logs of wood as stupid as themselves.  But that  the reader may judge of the degree in which opium is likely to stupefy  the faculties of an Englishman, I shall (by way of treating the question  illustratively, rather than argumentatively) describe the way in which I  myself often passed an opium evening in London during the period between  1804-1812.  It will be seen that at least opium did not move me to seek  solitude, and much less to seek inactivity, or the torpid state of self-  involution ascribed to the Turks.  I give this account at the risk of  being pronounced a crazy enthusiast or visionary; but I regard _that_  little.  I must desire my reader to bear in mind that I was a hard  student, and at severe studies for all the rest of my time; and certainly  I had a right occasionally to relaxations as well as other people.  These,  however, I allowed myself but seldom.    The late Duke of --- used to say, \"Next Friday, by the blessing of  heaven, I purpose to be drunk;\" and in like manner I used to fix  beforehand how often within a given time, and when, I would commit a  debauch of opium.  This was seldom more than once in three weeks, for at  that time I could not have ventured to call every day, as I did  afterwards, for \"_a glass of laudanum negus, warm, and without sugar_.\"  No, as I have said, I seldom drank laudanum, at that time, more than once  in three weeks: This was usually on a Tuesday or a Saturday night; my  reason for which was this.  In those days Grassini sang at the Opera, and  her voice was delightful to me beyond all that I had ever heard.  I know  not what may be the state of the Opera-house now, having never been  within its walls for seven or eight years, but at that time it was by  much the most pleasant place of public resort in London for passing an  evening.  Five shillings admitted one to the gallery, which was subject  to far less annoyance than the pit of the theatres; the orchestra was  distinguished by its sweet and melodious grandeur from all English  orchestras, the composition of which, I confess, is not acceptable to my  ear, from the predominance of the clamorous instruments and the absolute  tyranny of the violin.  The choruses were divine to hear, and when  Grassini appeared in some interlude, as she often did, and poured forth  her passionate soul as Andromache at the tomb of Hector, &c., I question  whether any Turk, of all that ever entered the Paradise of Opium-eaters,  can have had half the pleasure I had.  But, indeed, I honour the  barbarians too much by supposing them capable of any pleasures  approaching to the intellectual ones of an Englishman.  For music is an  intellectual or a sensual pleasure according to the temperament of him  who hears it.  And, by-the-bye, with the exception of the fine  extravaganza on that subject in \"Twelfth Night,\" I do not recollect more  than one thing said adequately on the subject of music in all literature;  it is a passage in the _Religio Medici_ {14} of Sir T. Brown, and though  chiefly remarkable for its sublimity, has also a philosophic value,  inasmuch as it points to the true theory of musical effects.  The mistake  of most people is to suppose that it is by the ear they communicate with  music, and therefore that they are purely passive to its effects.  But  this is not so; it is by the reaction of the mind upon the notices of the  ear (the _matter_ coming by the senses, the _form_ from the mind) that  the pleasure is constructed, and therefore it is that people of equally  good ear differ so much in this point from one another.  Now, opium, by  greatly increasing the activity of the mind, generally increases, of  necessity, that particular mode of its activity by which we are able to  construct out of the raw material of organic sound an elaborate  intellectual pleasure.  But, says a friend, a succession of musical  sounds is to me like a collection of Arabic characters; I can attach no  ideas to them.  Ideas! my good sir?  There is no occasion for them; all  that class of ideas which can be available in such a case has a language  of representative feelings.  But this is a subject foreign to my present  purposes; it is sufficient to say that a chorus, &c., of elaborate  harmony displayed before me, as in a piece of arras work, the whole of my  past life--not as if recalled by an act of memory, but as if present and  incarnated in the music; no longer painful to dwell upon; but the detail  of its incidents removed or blended in some hazy abstraction, and its  passions exalted, spiritualized, and sublimed.  All this was to be had  for five shillings.  And over and above the music of the stage and the  orchestra, I had all around me, in the intervals of the performance, the  music of the Italian language talked by Italian women--for the gallery  was usually crowded with Italians--and I listened with a pleasure such as  that with which Weld the traveller lay and listened, in Canada, to the  sweet laughter of Indian women; for the less you understand of a  language, the more sensible you are to the melody or harshness of its  sounds.  For such a purpose, therefore, it was an advantage to me that I  was a poor Italian scholar, reading it but little, and not speaking it at  all, nor understanding a tenth part of what I heard spoken.    These were my opera pleasures; but another pleasure I had which, as it  could be had only on a Saturday night, occasionally struggled with my  love of the Opera; for at that time Tuesday and Saturday were the regular  opera nights.  On this subject I am afraid I shall be rather obscure, but  I can assure the reader not at all more so than Marinus in his Life of  Proclus, or many other biographers and autobiographers of fair  reputation.  This pleasure, I have said, was to be had only on a Saturday  night.  What, then, was Saturday night to me more than any other night?  I  had no labours that I rested from, no wages to receive; what needed I to  care for Saturday night, more than as it was a summons to hear Grassini?  True, most logical reader; what you say is unanswerable.  And yet so it  was and is, that whereas different men throw their feelings into  different channels, and most are apt to show their interest in the  concerns of the poor chiefly by sympathy, expressed"]]]
