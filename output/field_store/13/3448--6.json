The rebus of Prior Thomas Goldstone--a shield with  three gold stones--is carved upon these arches.    #The Western Screen#, which separates the nave from the choir, is now more  commonly known as the organ-screen: it is a highly elaborate and beautiful  piece of work, and the carvings which decorate it are well worthy of  examination. In the lower niches there are six crowned figures: one  holding a church is believed to be Ethelbert, while it has been assumed  that the figure on the extreme right represents Richard II.: probably  Henry IV., who, as has been already mentioned, \"helped to build a good  part of the body of the Church\" has a place of honour here, but no  certainty on this matter is possible. The thirteen mitred niches which  encircle the arch once contained figures of Christ and the twelve  Apostles, but these were destroyed by the Puritans. The exact date of this  outward screen is uncertain, but it was set up at some time during the  fifteenth century. \"A little examination,\" says Willis, \"of its central  archway will detect the junction of this new work with the stone enclosure  of the choir.\" In fact, this archway is considerably higher than that of  De Estria which still remains behind it. The apex of this arch reaches but  a little above the capitals of the new arch, and the flat space, or  tympanum, thus left between the two, is filled with Perpendicular tracery.    #The Choir.#--\"In the year of grace one thousand one hundred and  seventy-four, by the just but occult judgment of God, the Church of Christ  at Canterbury was consumed by fire, in the forty-fourth year from its  dedication, that glorious choir, to wit, which had been so magnificently  completed by the care and industry of Prior Conrad\" (\"Gervase,\" translated  by Willis). The work of rebuilding was immediately begun by William, the  architect of Sens. At the beginning of the fifth year of his work, he was,  by a fall from the height of the capitals of the upper vault, \"rendered  helpless alike to himself and for the work, but no other person than  himself was in the least injured. Against the master only was the  vengeance of God or spite of the devil directed.\" He was succeeded in his  charge by one \"William by name, English by nation, small in body, but in  workmanship of many kinds acute and honest.\" Now in the sixth year from  the fire, we read that the monks were \"seized with a violent longing to  prepare the choir, so that they might enter it at the coming Easter. And  the master, perceiving their desires, set himself manfully to work, to  satisfy the wishes of the convent. He constructed, with all diligence, the  wall which encloses the choir and presbytery. He carefully prepared a  resting-place for St. Dunstan and St. Elfege. The choir thus hardly  completed even with the greatest labour and diligence, the monks were  resolved to enter on Easter Eve with the 'new fire,'\" that is, the  paschal candle which was lit on Easter Eve and burnt until Ascension Day.  The kindling of this light was carried out in a very ceremonious manner as  enjoined in Lanfranc's statutes. A fire was made in the cloister and duly  consecrated, and the monks, having lit a taper at this fire carried it on  the end of a staff in solemn procession, singing psalms and hymns and  burning incense, and lit the paschal candle in the choir with it.    Thus was the new choir completed, in the sixth year after the burning of  Conrad's. This part of the cathedral will be peculiarly interesting to the  architectural student, owing to the curious mixture of styles, which  enables him to compare the Norman and Early English characteristics side  by side. A striking feature in the aspect of the building, as seen from  the choir, is the remarkable inward bend with which the walls turn towards  one another at the end of the cathedral. The choir itself is peculiar in  the matter of length (180 feet--the longest in any English church), and  the lowness of the vaulting. The pillars, with their pier-arches and the  clerestory wall above are said by Willis to be without doubt the work of  William of Sens: but the whole question as to where the French William  left off and his English namesake began is extremely uncertain, as there  can be no doubt that William of Sens had fully planned out the work which  he was destined never to complete, and it is more than probable that his  successor worked largely upon his plans. We are on safer ground when we  assert that the new choir was altogether different from the building which  it replaced. The style was much more ornate and considerably lighter: the  characteristics of the work of the Williams are rich mouldings, varied and  elaborately carved capitals on the pillars, and the introduction of  gracefully slender shafts of Purbeck marble. Gervase, in pointing out the  differences between the works before and after the fire, mentions that  \"the old capitals were plain, the new ones most artistically sculptured.  The old arches and everything else either plain or sculptured with an axe  and not with a chisel, but in the new work first rate sculpture abounded  everywhere. In the old work no marble shafts, in the new innumerable ones.  Plain vaults instead of ribbed behind the choir.\" \"Sculptured with an  axe,\" reads rather curiously, but Professor Willis points out that \"the  axe is not quite so rude a weapon in the hands of a mason as it might  appear at first sight. The French masons use it to the present day with  great dexterity in carving.\" The mouldings used by Ernulf were extremely  simple, and were decorated with a \"peculiar and shallow class of notched  ornament\", of which many examples exist in other buildings of the period;  while the mouldings of William of Sens \"exhibit much variety, but are most  remarkable for the profusion of billet-work, zigzag and dogtooth, that are  lavished upon them.\" The first two methods of ornamentation are Norman,  the last an Early English characteristic. This mixture is not confined to  the details of decoration but may be observed also in the indiscriminate  employment of round and pointed arches. This feature, as Willis remarks,  \"may have arisen either from the indifference of the artist as to the  mixture of forms or else from deliberate contrivance, for as he was  compelled, from the nature of his work, to retain round-headed arcades,  windows, and arches, in the side-aisles, and yet was accustomed to and  desirous of employing pointed arches in his new building, he might  discreetly mix some round-headed arches with them, in order to make the  contrast less offensive by causing the mixture of forms to pervade the  whole composition, as if an intentional principle.\"    [Illustration: THE CHOIR, LOOKING EAST  (FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY CARL NORMAN AND CO.).]    Whatever the motive, this daring mixture renders the study of the  architectural features of our cathedral peculiarly interesting. In the  triforium we find a semicircular outer arch circumscribing two inner  pointed ones. The clerestory arch is pointed, while some of the transverse  ribs of the great vault are pointed and some round.    The inward bend of the walls at the end of the choir was necessitated by  the fact that the towers of St. Anselm and St. Andrew had survived the  great fire of 1174. Naturally the pious builders did not wish to pull down  these relics of the former church, so that a certain amount of contraction  had to be effected in order that these towers should form part of the new  plan. This arrangement also fitted in with the determination to build a  chapel of the martyred St. Thomas at the end of the church, on the site of  the former Trinity Chapel. For the Trinity Chapel had been much narrower  than the new choir, but this contraction enabled the rebuilders to  preserve its dimensions.    #The Altar#, when the choir was at first completed by William, stood  entirely alone, and without a reredos; behind it the archbishop's chair  was originally placed, but this was afterwards transferred to the corona.  The remarkable height at which the altar was set up is due to the fact  that it is placed over the new crypt, which is a good deal higher than the  older, or western crypt. Before the Reformation the high altar was richly  embellished with all kinds of precious and sacred ornaments and vessels:  while beneath it, in a vault, were stored a priceless collection of gold  and silver vessels: such of these as escaped the rapacity of Henry VIII.  were destroyed by the bigotry of the Puritan zealots: the latter made  havoc of the reredos which had been erected behind the high altar,  probably during the fourteenth century, and also a \"most idolatrous costly  glory cloth,\" the gift of Archbishop Laud. The reredos was replaced by a  Corinthian screen, which was of elaborate design, but must have been  strangely out of keeping with its surroundings; it was removed about 1870,  to make way for the present reredos which was designed in the style of the  screen work in the Lady Chapel in the crypt, but which cannot be commended  as an object of beauty. The altar coverings which are now in use were  presented to the cathedral by Queen Mary, the wife of William III., when  she visited Canterbury. A chalice, given by the Earl of Arundel in 1636,  is among the communion-plate. In his account of the building of the new  choir, Gervase tells us that \"the Master carefully prepared a  resting-place for St. Dunstan and St. Elfege--the co-exiles of the monks.\"  When the choir was ready, \"Prior Alan, taking with him nine of the  brethren of the Church in whom he could trust, went by night to the tombs  of the saints, so that he might not be incommoded by a crowd, and having  locked the doors of the church, he commanded the stone-work that inclosed  them to be taken down. The monks and the servants of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#11)"],[1,"had been  learned, but there was yet another lesson before her--a terrible one  indeed.    About the time Duskymane's brothers were a month old his foster-mother  returned in a strange condition. She was frothing at the mouth, her  legs trembled, and she fell in a convulsion near the doorway of the  den, but recovering, she came in. Her jaws quivered, her teeth rattled  a little as she tried to lick the little ones; she seized her own front  leg and bit it so as not to bite them, but at length she grew quieter  and calmer. The Cubs had retreated in fear to a far pocket, but now  they returned and crowded about her to seek their usual food. The  mother recovered, but was very ill for two or three days, and those  days with the poison in her system worked disaster for the brood. They  were terribly sick; only the strongest could survive, and when the  trial of strength was over, the den contained only the old one and the  Black-maned Cub, the one she had adopted. Thus little Duskymane became  her sole charge; all her strength was devoted to feeding him, and he  thrived apace.    Wolves are quick to learn certain things. The reactions of smell are  the greatest that a Wolf can feel, and thenceforth both Cub and  foster-mother experienced a quick, unreasoning sense of fear and hate  the moment the smell of strychnine reached them.      IV    THE RUDIMENTS OF WOLF TRAINING    With the sustenance of seven at his service the little Wolf had every  reason to grow, and when in the autumn he began to follow his mother on  her hunting trips he was as tall as she was. Now a change of region was  forced on them, for numbers of little Wolves were growing up. Sentinel  Butte, the rocky fastness of the plains, was claimed by many that were  big and strong; the weaker must move out, and with them Yellow Wolf and  the Dusky Cub.    Wolves have no language in the sense that man has; their vocabulary is  probably limited to a dozen howls, barks, and grunts expressing the  simplest emotions; but they have several other modes of conveying  ideas, and one very special method of spreading information--the  Wolf-telephone. Scattered over their range are a number of recognized  \"centrals.\" Sometimes these are stones, sometimes the angle of  cross-trails, sometimes a Buffalo-skull--indeed, any conspicuous object  near a main trail is used. A Wolf calling here, as a Dog does at a  telegraph post, or a Muskrat at a certain mud-pie point, leaves his  body-scent and learns what other visitors have been there recently to  do the same. He learns also whence they came and where they went, as  well as something about their condition, whether hunted, hungry,  gorged, or sick. By this system of registration a Wolf knows where his  friends, as well as his foes, are to be found. And Duskymane, following  after the Yellow Wolf, was taught the places and uses of the many  signal-stations without any conscious attempt at teaching on the part  of his foster-mother. Example backed by his native instincts was indeed  the chief teacher, but on one occasion at least there was something  very like the effort of a human parent to guard her child in danger.    The Dark Cub had learned the rudiments of Wolf life: that the way to  fight Dogs is to run, and to fight as you run, never grapple, but snap,  snap, snap, and make for the rough country where Horses cannot bring  their riders.    He learned not to bother about the Coyotes that follow for the pickings  when you hunt; you cannot catch them and they do you no harm.    He knew he must not waste time dashing after Birds that alight on the  ground; and that he must keep away from the little black and white  Animal with the bushy tail. It is not very good to eat, and it is very,  very bad to smell.    Poison! Oh, he never forgot that smell from the day when the den was  cleared of all his foster-brothers.    He now knew that the first move in attacking Sheep was to scatter them;  a lone Sheep is a foolish and easy prey; that the way to round up a  band of Cattle was to frighten a Calf.    He learned that he must always attack a Steer behind, a Sheep in front,  and a Horse in the middle, that is, on the flank, and never, never  attack a man at all, never even face him. But an important lesson was  added to these, one in which the mother consciously taught him of a  secret foe.      V    THE LESSON ON TRAPS    A Calf had died in branding-time and now, two weeks later, was in its  best state for perfect taste, not too fresh, not over-ripe--that is, in  a Wolf's opinion--and the wind carried this information afar. The  Yellow Wolf and Duskymane were out for supper, though not yet knowing  where, when the tidings of veal arrived, and they trotted up the wind.  The Calf was in an open place, and plain to be seen in the moonlight. A  Dog would have trotted right up to the carcass, an  old-time Wolf might  have done so, but constant war had developed constant vigilance in the  Yellow Wolf, and trusting nothing and no one but her nose, she slacked  her speed to a walk. On coming in easy view she stopped, and for long  swung her nose, submitting the wind to the closest possible chemical  analysis. She tried it with her finest tests, blew all the membranes  clean again and tried it once more; and this was the report of the  trusty nostrils, yes, the unanimous report. First, rich and racy smell  of Calf, seventy per cent.; smells of grass, bugs, wood, flowers,  trees, sand, and other uninteresting negations, fifteen per cent.;  smell of her Cub and herself, positive but ignorable, ten per cent.;  smell of human tracks, two per cent.; smell of smoke, one per cent.; of  sweaty leather smell, one per cent.; of human body-scent (not  discernible in some samples), one-half per cent.; smell of iron, a  trace.    The old Wolf crouched a little but sniffed hard with swinging nose; the  young Wolf imitatively did the same. She backed off to a greater  distance; the Cub stood. She gave a low whine; he followed unwillingly.  She circled around the tempting carcass; a new smell was  recorded--Coyote trail-scent, soon followed by Coyote body-scent. Yes,  there they were sneaking along a near ridge, and now as she passed to  one side the samples changed, the wind had lost nearly every trace of  Calf; miscellaneous, commonplace, and uninteresting smells were there  instead. The human track-scent was as before, the trace of leather was  gone, but fully one-half per cent, of iron-odor, and body smell of man  raised to nearly two per cent.    Fully alarmed, she conveyed her fear to the Cub, by her rigid pose, her  air intent, and her slightly bristling mane.    She continued her round. At one time on a high place the human body  scent was doubly strong, then as she dropped it faded. Then the wind  brought the full calf-odor with several track-scents of Coyotes and  sundry Birds. Her suspicions were lulling as in a smalling circle she  neared the tempting feast from the windward side. She had even advanced  straight toward it for a few steps when the sweaty leather sang loud  and strong again, and smoke and iron mingled like two strands of a  parti-colored yarn. Centring all her attention on this, she advanced  within two leaps of the Calf. There on the ground was a scrap of  leather, telling also of a human touch, close at hand the Calf, and now  the iron and smoke on the full vast smell of Calf were like a snake  trail across the trail of a whole Beef herd. It was so slight that the  Cub, with the appetite and impatience of youth, pressed up against his  mother's shoulder to go past and eat without delay. She seized him by  the neck and flung him back. A stone struck by his feet rolled forward  and stopped with a peculiar clink. The danger smell was greatly  increased at this, and the Yellow Wolf backed slowly from the feast,  the Cub unwillingly following.    As he looked wistfully he saw the Coyotes drawing nearer, mindful  chiefly to avoid the Wolves. He watched their really cautious advance;  it seemed like heedless rushing compared with his mother's approach.  The Calf smell rolled forth in exquisite and overpowering excellence  now, for they were tearing the meat, when a sharp clank was heard and a  yelp from a Coyote. At the same time the quiet night was shocked with a  roar and a flash of fire. Heavy shots spattered Calf and Coyotes, and  yelping like beaten Dogs they scattered, excepting one that was killed  and a second struggling in the trap set here by the ever-active  wolvers. The air was charged with the hateful smells redoubled now, and  horrid smells additional. The Yellow Wolf glided down a hollow and led  her Cub away in flight, but, as they went, they saw a man rush from the  bank near where the mother's nose had warned her of the human scent.  They saw him kill the caught Coyote and set the traps for more.        VI    THE BEGUILING OF THE YELLOW WOLF    The life game is a hard game, for we may win ten thousand times, and if  we fail but once our gain is gone. How many hundred times had the  Yellow Wolf scorned the traps; how many Cubs she had trained to do the  same! Of all the dangers to her life she best knew traps.    October had come; the Cub was now much taller than the mother. The  wolver had seen them once--a Yellow Wolf followed by another, whose  long, awkward legs, big, soft feet, thin neck, and skimpy tail  proclaimed him this year's Cub. The record of the dust and sand said  that the old one had lost a right front toe, and that the young one was  of giant size.    It was the wolver that thought to turn the carcass of the Calf to  profit, but he was disappointed in getting Coyotes instead of Wolves.  It was the beginning of the trapping season, for this month fur is  prime. A young trapper often fastens the bait on the trap; an  experienced one does not. A good trapper will even put the bait at one  place and the trap ten or twenty feet away, but at a spot that the Wolf  is likely to cross in circling."]]]
