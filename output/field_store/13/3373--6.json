In the  preceding year, when the Nile goes down, the fish first lay eggs in the  mud and then retire with the last of the retreating waters; and when  the time comes round again, and the water once more comes over the land,  from these eggs forthwith are produced the fishes of which I speak.    Thus it is as regards the fish. And for anointing those of the Egyptians  who dwell in the fens use oil from the castor-berry, which oil the  Egyptians call _kiki_, and thus they do:--they sow along the banks  of the rivers and pools these plants, which in a wild form grow of  themselves in the land of the Hellenes; these are sown in Egypt and  produce berries in great quantity but of an evil smell; and when they  have gathered these some cut them up and press the oil from them, others  again roast them first and then boil them down and collect that which  runs away from them. The oil is fat and not less suitable for burning  than olive-oil, but it gives forth a disagreeable smell. Against the  gnats, which are very abundant, they have contrived as follows:--those  who dwell above the fen-land are helped by the towers, to which they  ascend when they go to rest; for the gnats by reason of the winds  are not able to fly up high: but those who dwell in the fenland have  contrived another way instead of the towers, and this it is:--every man  of them has got a casting net, with which by day he catches fish, but  in the night he uses it for this purpose, that is to say he puts the  casting-net round about the bed in which he sleeps, and then creeps in  under it and goes to sleep: and the gnats, if he sleeps rolled up in a  garment or a linen sheet, bite through these, but through the net they  do not even attempt to bite.    Their boats with which they carry cargoes are made of the thorny acacia,  of which the form is very like that of the Kyrenian lotos, and that  which exudes from it is gum. From this tree they cut pieces of wood  about two cubits in length and arrange them like bricks, fastening  the boat together by running a great number of long bolts through the  two-cubits pieces; and when they have thus fastened the boat together,  they lay cross-pieces over the top, using no ribs for the sides; and  within they caulk the seams with papyrus. They make one steering-oar for  it, which is passed through the bottom of the boat; and they have a mast  of acacia and sails of papyrus. These boats cannot sail up the river  unless there be a very fresh wind blowing, but are towed from the shore:  down-stream however they travel as follows:--they have a door-shaped  crate made of tamarisk wood and reed mats sewn together, and also a  stone of about two talents weight bored with a hole; and of these the  boatman lets the crate float on in front of the boat, fastened with a  rope, and the stone drags behind by another rope. The crate then, as the  force of the stream presses upon it, goes on swiftly and draws on the  _baris_ (for so these boats are called), while the stone dragging after  it behind and sunk deep in the water keeps its course straight. These  boats they have in great numbers and some of them carry many thousands  of talents' burden.    When the Nile comes over the land, the cities alone are seen rising  above the water, resembling more nearly than anything else the islands  in the Egean Sea; for the rest of Egypt becomes a sea and the cities  alone rise above water. Accordingly, whenever this happens, they pass  by water not now by the channels of the river but over the midst of  the plain: for example, as one sails up from Naucratis to Memphis the  passage is then close by the pyramids, whereas the usual passage is not  the same even here, but goes by the point of the Delta and the city of  Kercasoros; while if you sail over the plain to Naucratis from the sea  and from Canobos, you will go by Anthylla and the city called after  Archander. Of these Anthylla is a city of note and is especially  assigned to the wife of him who reigns over Egypt, to supply her with  sandals, (this is the case since the time when Egypt came to be  under the Persians): the other city seems to me to have its name from  Archander the son-in-law of Danaos, who was the son of Phthios, the son  of Achaios; for it is called the City of Archander. There might indeed  by another Archander, but in any case the name is not Egyptian.      *****      Hitherto my own observation and judgment and inquiry are the vouchers  for that which I have said; but from this point onwards I am about to  tell the history of Egypt according to that which I have heard, to which  will be added also something of that which I have myself seen.    Of Min, who first became king of Egypt, the priests said that on the  one hand he banked off the site of Memphis from the river: for the whole  stream of the river used to flow along by the sandy mountain-range on  the side of Libya, but Min formed by embankments that bend of the river  which lies to the South about a hundred furlongs above Memphis, and thus  he dried up the old stream and conducted the river so that it flowed in  the middle between the mountains: and even now this bend of the Nile is  by the Persians kept under very careful watch, that it may flow in the  channel to which it is confined, and the bank is repaired every year;  for if the river should break through and overflow in this direction,  Memphis would be in danger of being overwhelmed by flood. When this Min,  who first became king, had made into dry land the part which was dammed  off, on the one hand, I say, he founded in it that city which is now  called Memphis; for Memphis too is in the narrow part of Egypt;  and outside the city he dug round it on the North and West a lake  communicating with the river, for the side towards the East is barred by  the Nile itself. Then secondly he established in the city the temple of  Hephaistos a great work and most worthy of mention. After this man the  priests enumerated to me from a papyrus roll the names of other kings,  three hundred and thirty in number; and in all these generations of men  eighteen were Ethiopians, one was a woman, a native Egyptian, and  the rest were men and of Egyptian race: and the name of the woman who  reigned was the same as that of the Babylonian queen, namely Nitocris.  Of her they said that desiring to take vengeance for her brother, whom  the Egyptians had slain when he was their king and then, after having  slain him, had given his kingdom to her,--desiring, I say, to take  vengeance for him, she destroyed by craft many of the Egyptians. For she  caused to be constructed a very large chamber under ground, and making  as though she would handsel it but in her mind devising other things,  she invited those of the Egyptians whom she knew to have had most part  in the murder, and gave a great banquet. Then while they were feasting,  she let in the river upon them by a secret conduit of large size. Of  her they told no more than this, except that, when this had been  accomplished, she threw herself into a room full of embers, in order  that she might escape vengeance. As for the other kings, they could tell  me of no great works which had been produced by them, and they said that  they had no renown except only the last of them, Moiris: he (they  said) produced as a memorial of himself the gateway of the temple of  Hephaistos which is turned towards the North Wind, and dug a lake, about  which I shall set forth afterwards how many furlongs of circuit it has,  and in it built pyramids of the size which I shall mention at the same  time when I speak of the lake itself. He, they said, produced these  works, but of the rest none produced any.    Therefore passing these by I will make mention of the king who came  after these, whose name is Sesostris. He (the priests said) first of all  set out with ships of war from the Arabian gulf and subdued those who  dwelt by the shores of the Erythraian Sea, until as he sailed he came  to a sea which could no further be navigated by reason of shoals: then  secondly, after he had returned to Egypt, according to the report of the  priests he took a great army and marched over the continent, subduing  every nation which stood in his way: and those of them whom he found  valiant and fighting desperately for their freedom, in their lands he  set up pillars which told by inscriptions his own name and the name of  his country, and how he had subdued them by his power; but as to those  of whose cities he obtained possession without fighting or with ease, on  their pillars he inscribed words after the same tenor as he did for the  nations which had shown themselves courageous, and in addition he drew  upon them the hidden parts of a woman, desiring to signify by this that  the people were cowards and effeminate. Thus doing he traversed the  continent, until at last he passed over to Europe from Asia and subdued  the Scythians and also the Thracians. These, I am of opinion, were the  furthest people to which the Egyptian army came, for in their country  the pillars are found to have been set up, but in the land beyond this  they are no longer found. From this point he turned and began to go  back; and when he came to the river Phasis, what happened then I cannot  say for certain, whether the king Sesostris himself divided off a  certain portion of his army and left the men there as settlers in  the land, or whether some of his soldiers were wearied by his distant  marches and remained by the river Phasis. For the people of Colchis are  evidently Egyptian, and this I perceived for myself before I heard it  from others. So when I had come to consider the matter I asked them  both; and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],[0,"Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#11)"],[1,"the tyrant, and immediately went on picking up and  scattering the hay all around it, thickly covering the grass.    \"Well, I suppose we had better get down now, hadn't we?\" cried Glyn.    \"Yes, sir--no, sir.  Just wait a little bit, please,\" cried Ramball.  \"You're a-keeping of him quiet; only I don't want this 'ere to be made a  free gratus exhibition for everybody to see.  It's a cutting off my  profits.  Hi, there, some of you! why don't you shut them gates?\" he  shouted to certain of his men who were driving in the latter half of the  line of yellow vans.    \"Can't get the rest in if we do, sir,\" came back.    \"No, of course they can't,\" grunted their master, looking up at the two  lads.  \"Things is going awkward to-day, and no mistake.--Oh, here comes  the water,\" he continued, speaking now to Singh.  \"I dare say that will  cool him down.  Just say a word to him, sir, and tell him to drink.\"    \"Tell the men to put the buckets down before him,\" replied Singh; and as  the water-bearer drew near the elephant evidently scented the refreshing  fluid, and uttered a sonorous snort.    Directly after, as the man nervously set down the brimming buckets,  anxiously watching the waving trunk the while, and leaping away as he  saw it coming towards him, the tip of the great hose-like organ was  thrust into the first vessel, there was a low sound of suction as many  quarts were drawn up, and then the end was curled under, thrust right  back into the huge creature's mouth, and then there was a loud squirting  sound like a fire-engine beginning to play to put out the animal's  burning thirst.    Back went the trunk into the bucket again, the curving inward followed  for a second discharge, there was repetition, till in a very brief space  the first bucket was empty, and then, with a disdainful swing of the  trunk, the vessel was sent flying, and the emptying of the second  commenced, to be ended by the satiated beast picking it up to hold it on  high as if to drain out the last drops, and then begin to swing it to  and fro as if to hurl it at its master.    \"Hah-h-h-h-ah!\" cried Singh, and the great creature ceased swinging the  bucket to and fro, and dropped it on the hay.    \"Come, Singh, we have had enough of this,\" cried Glyn impatiently.  \"Let's get back, or we shall be having the Doctor sending to see what  has become of us.\"    \"Don't you be afraid about that, young gentlemen,\" cried Ramball.  \"I'll  speak up for you both.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Glyn drily; \"but you've done with us now.\"    \"Done with you, young gentlemen!  I only wish you'd stop and join my  troupe.  I'll make it right and pleasant for you, and be glad too.  Pay  you better, too, than any one else would when you leave school.  Why,  bless your heart, you--the dark one I'm talking to--if you like to come  I'll spend any amount up to a hundred pounds for getting you a thorough  Indian corstume all muslin and gold, and a turban with jewels in it--  imitations, of course, it wouldn't run to real, but the best as is to be  had--with a plume of feathers too, ready for you to ride in procession  same as you did to-day.  What do you say?\"    \"Yes, Singh,\" cried Glyn laughing, as he sat close behind his companion,  and catching him by the shoulders he began to shake him to and fro.  \"There's an offer for you.  What do you say?\"    \"I am going to get down,\" said Singh with a haughty curve to his lip.  \"Well, I won't tell him I'm not an English boy.\"  Then sharply resuming  his native tongue, he uttered an order which made the great beast kneel  down in the hay with its trunk stretched straight out before it, and  raising its ears a little, ready for its two riders to climb down  forwards and spring off.    \"Ha!\" cried Singh, as he approached close to the elephant and planted  his right foot upon the upper portion of its trunk.  \"I should rather  like to have you,\" he said, speaking softly, so that his words only  reached his companion's ear.  \"You are the first in England to show me  that you know what I am.\"    \"But you can't have him, Singh,\" said Glyn laughing.  \"No more elephants  till we get back to Dour, and that won't be for years to come.\"    \"No,\" said the boy sadly; \"that will not be for years to come.--Huh!\" he  cried to the elephant, as he removed his foot and drew back.  \"You're a  fine old beast after all.\"    The monster rose at his command, and stood blinking at him and swinging  his trunk to and fro.    \"Mind, sir!\" shouted Ramball, who had been looking on anxiously.  \"Don't  you trust him.  He's brewing mischief.  He always is when he looks quiet  like that; and the way he can knock you over with that trunk--my word!\"    \"Oh, he's not going to knock me over with his trunk,\" said Singh,  smiling; and, uttering a few words in Hindustani, he stood close up to  the elephant and reached one hand up to its great ear and laid the other  upon its trunk.    \"Salaam, Maharajah!\" he cried, and the animal threw up its head, curled  up its trunk, and trumpeted loudly, before going down upon its knees  before the lad.    \"Good!  Up again!\" cried Singh in Hindustani, and added a few more  words, the result of which was that the monster stood calmly by its  great picket-peg, making its chain jingle as it began slowly swaying its  head from side to side again.    \"Well done, sir!\" cried Ramball.  \"Thank you, sir.  You'll shake hands  with me, won't you?\"    \"Oh yes,\" said Singh quietly; \"I'll shake hands,\" and he extended his  own.    \"You are a gentleman and no mistake,\" cried the man.  \"I say, think that  offer of mine over.  I'll make it worth your while.  I will, honour  bright!\"    Singh shook his head gravely, and there was a mocking smile upon his  lip.    \"No, no, thank you,\" he said.  \"I am going back to school, and some day  back to India; but I should like to come and see you and the elephant  again.\"    \"Of course you would, sir, and come you shall,\" cried Ramball.  \"Perpetual passes!  You don't want no pass.  Just you show your face  here, both of you, whenever you like, and bring as many of your  schoolmates with you too, and you will be as welcome as the flowers of  May.  Look here, young gentlemen, I am going to keep the show open here  for three days, and then we go off to my farm three miles out of the  town to lay up for a bit of rest and do repairs, and get the animals  into condition, before we take the road again.  You come and see me  there, and pick out what you'd like to have, monkeys or parrots, as I  said.  I don't offer you anything big, because I don't suppose you could  keep it at school; but I have got some of the amusingest little monkeys  you ever see, and a parrot as can talk--when he likes, mind you,\"  continued the man, laying a fat finger against his nose, \"and that ain't  always.  But when he is in the temper for it he can say anything, and  you wouldn't know but what it was a human being.--Going, gentlemen?\"    \"Yes, we are going now,\" said Singh.    \"Yes, it's time we were off,\" said Glyn; \"but I say, Mr Ramball, what  about that rifle?\"    \"Rifle?  Oh, you mean my gun?\"    \"Yes,\" said Glyn.  \"You don't mean to shoot that grand beast?\"    \"Shoot him, sir?  Not me.  It put me in such a temper and made me say  that.  But, young gentlemen, do think over what I said.  Why, if you  joined my troupe, I'm blessed if I wouldn't buy another as big as him,  and then you'd have a elephant apiece.\"        CHAPTER EIGHT.    DOCTOR BEWLEY CHANGES SIDES.    As the two lads reached the main street, chatting over their adventure,  something occurred which made Glyn turn his head sharply, and as he did  so a small boy shouted, \"Hooray!\"    It was the little spark applied to the touch-hole of a cannon, and a  loud roar followed.    \"Here, let's go back,\" cried Singh.  \"The Rajah's broken loose again.\"    \"No, no,\" cried Glyn.  \"They are shouting at us.\"    \"What for?  What have we done?\"    \"I suppose it's because we rode the elephant.  Here, come along; let's  turn down here and get round by the fields.\"    The young Indian generally gave way to his English friend; and, obeying  directly, they hurried down the first turning, but in vain.  A crowd of  men and boys were after them, cheering loudly, and this crowd was  snowball-like in the way in which the farther it rolled the more it  grew.  So that in spite of all their efforts they were literally hunted  right up to the Doctor's gates, where they arrived hot and breathless to  find a larger crowd than before which had gathered to satisfy themselves  with the rather empty view of the damaged hedge, the big footmarks, and  a wheelwright and some of Ramball's men getting the great bottomless  elephant-van into condition for dragging to the show-field.    As soon as the two boys came in sight there was a rush made for them,  and amidst deafening cheering and vain efforts to hoist them  shoulder-high and carry them into the playground, they managed to reach  this resort at last, and join their schoolfellows in keeping out the  excited mob, some of whom, the youngest of course, began to decorate the  brick wall with their persons like so many living statues.  And then to  the two lads' disgust, the whole school, with the exception of Slegge,  and half-a-dozen of his party who wanted to join in the ovation but did  not dare in the presence of their tyrant, began to cheer them as loudly  as the boys without.  Several of the younger juniors began to idolise  them in a very juvenile way by hanging on to them, slapping their backs,  and shaking hands.    Altogether it was a strange mingling of the pleasant and unpleasant, the  former predominating with Singh, who for the first time since he had  joined the school found himself thoroughly liked.    Slegge and his following stood aloof, the latter listening to the  former's sneering remarks, some of which reached Glyn and made him feel  hot; while just in the midst of the loudest cheering, Wrench the  man-servant made his appearance,"]]]
