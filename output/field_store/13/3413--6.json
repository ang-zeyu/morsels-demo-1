You  look as if they might be romantic, but I suppose you are really off on  the quest of the blooming bacillus or the meandering microbe, or hanging  over--what is it you call your garden beds of disease--a culture?\"    He looked up and patted her hand. \"It is too bad not to be able to be a  hero to one's own sister, but the truth is, I wasn't thinking at all,  just wool-gathering. By the way, Frank, are you going to motor down to  that meeting of Miss Holland's to-night?\"    \"Wool-gathering, he calls it!\" said the younger man, letting his lump of  sugar clatter on his saucer. \"I'd say it was all cry and no wool; at  least you are pulling none over my eyes. Am I going to motor down to  hear the protests of the proletariat to-night? No, dear brother, I am  not. When I go out to mingle with the down-trodden and oppressed I take  the 'L'; a surface car would be even more appropriate, but they take  forever, and I compromise on the 'L,' but you never did have any sense  of dramatic fitness.\"    \"Might I ask why this sudden interest in the militant laboring ladies?\"  said Ramsey, drawing up his chair before the fire, and lighting a  cigarette. \"Are you going to obtrude your somewhat massive personality  upon the scene?\"    \"Yes, that's what I'd like to know,\" added Frank.    The doctor laughed rather diffidently. \"Why not?\" he said. \"Why  shouldn't I go, if I wish to?\"    Frank flung out his hands with a gesture of mock despair. \"Now, wouldn't  that come and get you!\" he said. \"I appeal to you, Hilda. You were  present; you heard Miss Holland invite me to this Manifesto Makers'  meeting. You know she never said a word to Jack; she didn't even look at  him. He was foolish enough to let her see that he was already a convert  to her little gospel, and therefore no longer in need of her  ministrations. But as for me, 'I was a wandering sheep; I did not love  the fold,' and hence, as a good missionary, she feels a deep interest in  me. Off and on, I should say at least fifty Colorado women have tried to  make a suffragist of me. Some of them were very pretty,\" he added  reminiscently, \"and I've noticed that the prettier they are the longer  it takes 'em to make me see the error of my ways. Now with Miss Holland,  I wouldn't mind letting her tinker with my political views so long as we  both shall live.\"    \"Frank, you are incorrigible,\" said his sister. \"If Miss Holland knew  what a flighty, inconsequent infant you are, she wouldn't waste a  thought on you, let alone a whole evening. What makes you want to go,  anyhow?\"    \"What's the use of her wasting thoughts on a solemn dub like our  brother?\" he demanded aggrievedly. \"What business has he trailing the  soap-boxing suffragers around when he is about to take upon himself vows  to cleave only to the daughter of a militant 'Anti' leader, some time  when he can jar himself loose from his professional cares long enough  for a honeymoon?\"    \"I'm afraid, Jack, you will find your prospective mother-in-law quite as  strenuous as the most ardent of the suffragists,\" said his sister. \"I  haven't gone into this thing at all, I haven't time, but it is certainly  amusing to watch the 'Antis' outdo even the most ardent suffragettes by  way of proving their contention that woman's sphere is home. If they  were consistent, they would never appear in public----\"    \"Except by 'Now comes the counsel for the defendant,'\" interrupted  Frank, \"but they never are. There is a little bunch of them in Colorado  who have failed to command the same attention in politics that their  money imposes upon the social world, so they rush into type and get  themselves interviewed and asked to speak when they come East, all by  way of proving their sensitive and shrinking nature. I don't agree with  the suffragists, not a little bit, but I can fraternize with them; they  are sincere, but none of the 'Antis' for me; never saw one yet who  wasn't either a snob or so narrow-minded that a toothpick would look  like the Brooklyn Bridge by comparison.\"    \"Hear, hear!\" cried Jack. \"Miss Holland has certainly made an impression  upon you; not that I see what difference it makes, since women already  vote where you hail from.\"    \"That just goes to show how foolish a smart man can be,\" replied his  brother cheerfully. \"You think because you may have a vote on the  enfranchisement of women that it is very important what you think, but  is it? Not at all. But with me it is different. I've paid office rent in  Denver for two years, and spent a third of the time here or in  Washington. I've looked in on two State conventions, and forgot to  register at the last election, but because I come from Colorado I am  considered an authority on woman suffrage, and when I say it's no good,  and swell out my chest and look gloomy, it has great weight, great  weight!\" He leaned back in his chair and gave way to unseemly mirth as  he recalled some occasion on which he had evidently hoaxed some trusting  reporter.    \"Nonsense, Frank,\" his brother-in-law answered. \"I don't believe you  know the first thing about politics or suffrage, or what the women have  done or haven't done.\"    \"There you wrong me,\" the young man answered gravely. \"The first thing  to know in politics is when to come into the game and when to keep out.  Personally, I can't make my firm believe that it is cheaper to buy the  other fellows' men after they are elected than it is to try to elect our  own, and have them raise the ante on us, but they'll come to it after a  while. As to the women, bless you, voting doesn't change their nature,  and so long as women are willing to believe what men tell them, it's  mighty unsafe to trust them with the ballot. Before you know it, they'll  find us out, and then you'll see the first result of the suffragist  dream of heaven on earth--there'll be no more marrying or giving in  marriage. Oh, I'm dead against it!\"    They all joined in the laughter that followed this sally, and Hilda  said thoughtfully, \"If you boys are intent on this meeting, I'll hurry  dinner, for they probably begin early.\" As she rose to go, Frank caught  her hand with the piteous entreaty, \"Oh, please make my big brother take  his marbles and go home. He wasn't asked to this party. Miss Holland  didn't say a thing to him. I don't see why he has to have first show  with all the pretty girls in New York!\"    \"When Miss Holland knows you, and all your native charm, she will never  smile again upon your older brother,\" laughed his sister, \"but in the  meantime I suppose it's an open meeting, and we can't prevent his going.  But don't worry; his fatal beauty will but serve as a foil to your more  sparkling type. Besides, with your vivid imagination, unhampered by a  slavish subserviency to facts, you should be able to furnish canards  that will occupy all Miss Holland's time for a month.\"    As she left the room her husband opened the door, and her brothers rose  and remained standing until it was closed after her.    \"If all women were like her----\" Frank said impulsively, but Ramsey  stopped him.    \"If half of them were like her,\" he said reverently, \"I would be in  favor of turning the government over to them, certain that the hand that  rocks the cradle would never give this storm-tossed old world more  shaking up than is good for it.\"          CHAPTER XI    THE ADVANCING COLUMN OF DEMOCRACY      As the two brothers turned into the cross street that led to the hall  where the Industrial League had its headquarters and held its weekly  meetings, Dr. Earl laid his hand on Frank's shoulder.    \"Dear old fellow,\" he said affectionately, \"would you mind telling me  what on earth possesses you to come down here to-night? I'm not asking  out of mere curiosity, nor do I believe that is the motive that brings  you.\"    \"Then if I say the pursuit of the good, the true and the beautiful, you  will not believe me?\" his brother answered lightly.    \"I shall know you do not wish to tell me the real reason, and will drop  it, but I shall not be deceived. I haven't studied my kind for this long  without knowing at least the a-b-c of human nature. You use your cap and  bells and an air of frivolity to conceal your true character from the  world, as other men cloak themselves in an atmosphere of austerity and  reserve.\"    \"Discovered!\" cried Frank, with a laugh, \"after all these years in which  I flattered myself I had made such a good job of it, too. Truth to tell,  no mask and domino ever afforded such perfect protection as the jingle  of my jester's bells. I am apparently so given up to pomps and vanities  that nobody gives me credit for a serious thought, and so takes no pains  to conceal his own from me. It has long been one of the wonders of my  world how I hold my job.\"    \"Well, since you put it that way, I have asked myself at times how you  have achieved the standing you have in your profession, a standing of  which we are all immensely proud, by the way. But if you are a profound  student, it is something recent; I used to think you learned too easily  ever to know how to study, and law is a vocation.\"    \"Law is one thing and success in the legal profession is another,\" said  the young man oracularly. \"Between our omnipresent legislatures which  spend our time and money repealing what we lawyers already know, and  enacting laws for the courts to set aside, these are what might be  called parlous times for the profession, but my long suit is not in  understanding statutes, but people.\"    Insensibly he had dropped his flippant tone, and was speaking,  seriously, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22288"],[0,"Chinese Painters: A Critical Study (#11)"],[1," from these a  ready-made technique by which they were controlled. Turning from nature  they yielded to imagination. They delighted in painting fanciful  landscapes and were inclined toward images that were more external and  less inspired than in the past. Their works, however, were invested with  great charm, and the impossible disposition of their clustering peaks and  oddly cleft rocks cannot but appeal to the imagination.    In these overladen compositions the unity of the picture is lost. We are  no longer in the presence of a simple and forceful idea, but behold a  thousand incidents, a thousand little details, exquisite in themselves,  but which require a search. It is a new conception of landscape. We may  possibly prefer the gripping formula of Sung and Yuean art, but we are  forced to acknowledge that this later work has great charm and extreme  refinement.      [Illustration: PLATE XXI. LANDSCAPE    Ming Period. Bouasse-Lebel Collection.]    To this general trend was added a new taste in color, which became  brilliant and complex like the composition itself, harmonious and graceful  in the paintings of the masters and always charming in the work of  painters of the second rank; but this was the herald of a blatant and  vulgar manner which gradually gained ground until it came to be generally  adopted by the artisans of the Ch'ing period.    While landscape under the Ming painters was assuming a different guise,  and, forgetful of the observances of the past, was beguiling the mind by  its charm and delicacy, a new type of figure was also developing. Here we  must pause for a moment.    We have seen that figures were treated before landscape by the painters of  periods preceding the T'ang dynasty. This early tradition had submitted to  the influence of Buddhist art and, while certain of its elements were  revived in the work of a few masters, there is no doubt that figure  painting from the seventh and eighth centuries on, was absolutely  revolutionized. The inevitable result was a new type in the sixteenth  century. Painters studied the line for itself, determined its proportions,  and analyzed features and drapery. As far as our present knowledge  extends, their observations were not collected and codified until the end  of the nineteenth century, but the assembled writings testify that the  result of their studies was expressed along the lines indicated from the  end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth centuries. Their  ideal was totally different from that of the old masters. The figure  treated for itself with but few accessories became the sole aim of the  painter. He endeavored to show the charm of a woman's face, the dainty and  elegant gestures, the supple and voluptuous gait, and he grasped the  characteristics and peculiarities of a man's figure by means of an  intensified drawing. At times, the influence of analysis was so objective  that it resulted in a painting closely approaching European standards. The  taste expressed in landscape was likewise evident in figures. There were  brilliant and harmonious colors, a charm which became exquisite in the  coquettish and vivacious faces of women with ivory skin and brilliant  eyes, of graceful movements, and with long, slender, delicate hands,  incarnations of the fairies of ancient legend or historic beauties whose  memory still lived.    In a word, the philosophical inspiration to which the Sung dynasty owed  its glory was discarded to make way for the painting of everyday life, a  realistic representation of the world and its activities, which in Japan  gave rise to the Ukioyoye school, and in China recruited a series of  painters of the first rank outside the limits of academic tradition.    It would be interesting to study the influence of this movement of the  China of the time of Ming upon the originators of the Ukioyoye in Japan.  It is certain that the movement on the continent preceded similar  manifestations in the island empire by a century, and it is also certain  that the Japanese empire was directly influenced by the China of the Ming  period. Chinese painters were established in Japan as early as the  fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. There is one of whose family name we  are ignorant and who is known only under the appellation of Ju-sue,--in  Japanese Josetsu. He left China, where the domination of official art  stood in the way of an independent career, carried the traditions of Sung  and Yuean art to Japan, gathered pupils about him there, and had the glory  of being the founder of that magnificent school of which Sesshiu is the  leading exponent. There is only one small painting which can be attributed  to Ju-sue with certainty. This is preserved in a Japanese temple.  Unfortunately it is a work of small importance which, notwithstanding its  intrinsic value, by no means furnishes sufficient information to enable us  to pronounce on the authenticity of several other works which are said to  be by his hand. We find in the latter an extremely individual art, in  accordance with early traditions, but with the addition of something  fanciful and unexpected which gives this painter marked distinction.  Having worked outside of China, however, his influence was not felt in the  evolution of Chinese painting.    In the seventeenth century Ming art came in contact with the art of the  Europeans. The methods and rules of the Italian ateliers of the end of the  Renaissance were brought to China by missionary painters whose talent was  of a secondary order. The system of monocular perspective and modeling,  strongly accentuated by the opposition of light and shade, made a forcible  impression on the Chinese mind. Indications of this are found in the  Chinese books on art. But the technical methods were too different and the  systems too much at variance to meet on any common ground. Notwithstanding  its effect upon certain painters, the influence of European painting was  on the whole negligible. Father Matteo Ricci worked at the end of the Ming  period under the Chinese name of Li Ma-tu and Father Castiglione, at the  beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty, used the name of Lang Chue-ning, but,  although the former continued to use European methods, while the latter  adopted the Chinese procedure, these were only isolated efforts submerged  in the great wave of Asiatic evolution.          VIII. THE CH'ING PERIOD--SEVENTEENTH TO TWENTIETH CENTURIES      The Ch'ing or Manchu dynasty, whose downfall we have recently witnessed,  brought no new vigor to China. Barbarians once again invaded the aged and  enfeebled empire usurping the methods, history and organization of the  preceding periods. The change in China at the end of the seventeenth  century was only dynastic. The evolution of Ming tendencies continued, and  despite the reorganization undertaken by Kang Hsi and maintained by his  two successors, the excessive requirements of the old system, which had  been formulated during the Sung epoch and definitely established in the  Yuean and Ming periods, were so exacting that irremediable decadence was  inevitable. Thenceforward no great changes in the realm of painting need  be expected. It only continued its logical evolution.    It is necessary, nevertheless, to lay stress on the value of Chinese  painting from the seventeenth to the twentieth century, for an opinion is  current that, while there might still be something of value under the Ming  dynasty, nothing good was produced under the Ch'ing. It is undeniable that  marked signs of decadence are seen in the latter period, but by the side  of some inferior works, others exist which maintain the vitality of the  past and the hope of a renaissance.    In refutation of such hasty and ill informed opinion, it is sufficient to  recall a number of paintings, signed and dated, of the eighteenth and  nineteenth centuries, which dealers or collectors calmly attribute to the  eleventh and twelfth.    Chinese painting at the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the  eighteenth century was still full of vitality. The taste for brilliant  color gradually diminished, and the composition became broader and more  noble at the hands of certain painters, in whom is seen the revival of the  vigorous race of yore. This was the time when Yuen Shou-p'ing, more  commonly known under the name of Nan-t'ien, painted landscape and flowers  with the restraint and power of the old style, and when Shen Nan-p'ing set  out for Japan to found a modern Chinese school which was to rival the  Ukioyoye in importance and activity. About them was grouped a large  following, foretelling fresh developments.    No support was given to this movement by the new government, which was  infatuated with the academic style of the earlier reigns and becoming more  and more ignorant as the last years of the nineteenth century approached.  In the eighteenth century a comparatively large number of Chinese painters  settled in Japan, where they continued the traditions of Ming art. The  observation of a Nan-t'ien or of a Shen Nan-p'ing was keen and  painstaking, but the objectivity and realism now coming to the fore, were  conspicuous in their works. No longer was it the world of pure substance  and abstract principle that was sought, but the real, everyday world, the  world of objective forms studied for themselves, living their own life, on  the threshold of which the spirit halted, no longer guided by the old  philosophies.      [Illustration: PLATE XXII. BEAUTY INHALING THE FRAGRANCE OF A PEONY    Ming Period. Collection of V. Goloubew.]    This character was maintained up to the nineteenth century. It is seen in  the painting of flowers and landscape as well as in figure painting. These  traits are equally apparent in an iris by Nan t'ien and a personage by  Huang Yin-piao. The latter, working in the middle of the eighteenth  century, evoked the personages of Buddhist and Taoist legend with a  skillful brush, "]]]
