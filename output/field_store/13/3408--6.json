Nine  hundred were slaughtered on the seashore and six hundred made  prisoners. Some say that the admiral intended to punish his men for  their disobedience; others that he sighted Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n's fleet  coming to the rescue. At all events he drew off, and the two great  rivals did not meet. The Genoese picked up some Barbary vessels on his  way home to console him for his failure.    [Illustration: ANDREA DORIA.]    In the following year he retrieved his fame by a brilliant expedition  to the coasts of Greece. With thirty-five sail and forty-eight galleys  he attacked Coron, by way of making a diversion while Sultan  Suleym[=a]n was invading Hungary,[23] and after a heavy bombardment  succeeded in landing his men on the curtain of the fort. The Turkish  garrison was spared and marched out, and Mendoza was left in command,  while Doria bore up to Patras and took it, occupied the castles which  guard the Gulf of Corinth, and returned in triumph to Genoa before the  Turkish fleet could come up with him. This was in September, 1532. In  the following spring a yet more daring feat was accomplished. Coron  was running short of supplies, and a Turkish fleet blockaded the port.  Nevertheless Cristofero Pallavicini carried his ship in, under cover  of the castle guns, and encouraged the garrison to hold out; and  Doria, following in splendid style, fought his way in, notwithstanding  that half his fleet, being sailing galleons, became becalmed in the  midst of the Turkish galleys, and had to be rescued in the teeth of  the enemy. Lutfi Pasha was outmanoeuvred and defeated. This  revictualling of Coron, says Admiral Jurien de la Graviere, was one of  the skilfullest naval operations of the sixteenth century.[24]    It was clear that, while Doria had effected almost nothing against the  Barbary Corsairs, he always mastered the Turks. The Sultan was eager  to discover Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n's secret of success, and counted the days  till he should arrive in the Golden Horn. The Corsair, for his part,  had heard enough of Doria's recent exploits to use more than his  habitual caution, and he was not disposed to cheapen his value in the  Sultan's eyes by a too precipitate compliance with his Majesty's  command. At last, in August, 1533, having appointed Hasan Aga, a  Sardinian eunuch, in whom he greatly confided, to be viceroy during  his absence, Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n set sail from Algiers with a few galleys;  and after doing a little business on his own account--looting Elba and  picking up some Genoese corn-ships--pursued his way, passing Malta at  a respectful distance, and coasting the Morea, till he dropped anchor  in the Bay of Salonica.[25] By his route, which touched Santa Maura  and Navarino, he appears to have been looking for Doria, in spite of  the smallness of his own force (which had, however, been increased by  prizes); but, fortunately, perhaps, for the Corsair, the Genoese  admiral had returned to Sicily, and the two had missed each other on  the way.    Soon the eyes of the Sultan were rejoiced with the sight of a Barbary  fleet, gaily dressed with flags and pennons, rounding Seraglio Point,  and, in perfect order, entering the deep water of the Golden Horn; and  presently Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n and his eighteen captains were bowing before  the Grand Signior, and reaping the rewards due to their fame and  services. It was a strange sight that day at Eski Serai,[26] and the  divan was crowded. The tried generals and statesmen of the greatest of  Ottoman emperors assembled to gaze upon the rough sea-dogs whose  exploits were on the lips of all Europe; and most of all they  scrutinized the vigorous well-knit yet burly figure of the old man  with the bushy eyebrows and thick beard, once a bright auburn, but  now hoary with years and exposure to the freaks of fortune and rough  weather. In his full and searching eye, that could blaze with ready  and unappeasable fury, they traced the resolute mind which was to show  them the way to triumphs at sea, comparable even to those which their  victorious Sultan had won before strong walls and on the battle plain.  The Grand Vez[=i]r Ibrah[=i]m recognized in Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n the man he  needed, and the Algerine Corsair was preferred before all the admirals  of Turkey, and appointed to reconstruct the Ottoman navy. He spent the  winter in the dockyards, where his quick eye instantly detected the  faults of the builders. The Turks of Constantinople, he found, knew  neither how to build nor how to work their galleys.[27] Theirs were  not so swift as the Christians'; and instead of turning sailors  themselves, and navigating them properly, they used to kidnap  shepherds from Arcadia and Anatolia, who had never handled a sail or a  tiller in their lives, and entrust the navigation of their galleys to  these inexperienced hands.[28] Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n soon changed all this.  Fortunately there were workmen and timber in abundance, and, inspiring  his men with his own marvellous energy, he laid out sixty-one galleys  during the winter, and was able to take the sea with a fleet of  eighty-four vessels in the spring. The period of Turkish supremacy on  the sea dates from Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n's winter in the dockyards.    FOOTNOTES:    [23] See the _Story of Turkey_, 191.    [24] _Doria et Barberousse_, Pt.

TUNIS TAKEN AND LOST.    1534-1535.      The dwellers on the coasts of Italy soon discovered the new spirit in  the Turkish fleet; they had now to dread Corsairs on both hands, east  as well as west. In the summer of 1534 Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n led his new  fleet of eighty-four galleys forth from the Golden Horn, to flesh  their appetite on a grand quest of prey. Entering the Straits of  Messina, he surprised Reggio, and carried off ships and slaves;  stormed and burnt the castle of S. Lucida next day, and took eight  hundred prisoners; seized eighteen galleys at Cetraro; put Sperlonga  to the sword and brand, and loaded his ships with wives and maidens. A  stealthy inland march brought the Corsairs to Fondi, where lay Giulia  Gonzaga, the young and beautiful widow of Vespasio Colonna, Duchess of  Trajetto and Countess of Fondi. She was sister to the \"heavenly Joanna  of Aragon,\" on whose loveliness two hundred and eighty Italian poets  and rimesters in vain exhausted the resources of several languages;--a  loveliness shared by the sister whose device was the \"Flower of Love\"  amaranth blazoned on her shield. This beauty Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n destined  for the Sultan's harem, and so secret were the Corsairs' movements  that he almost surprised the fair Giulia in her bed. She had barely  time to mount a horse in her shift and fly with a single  attendant,--whom she afterwards condemned to death, perhaps because  the beauty revealed that night had made him overbold.[29] Enraged at  her escape the pirates made short work of Fondi; the church was  wrecked, and the plundering went on for four terrible hours, never to  be forgotten by the inhabitants.    Refreshed and excited by their successful raid, the Turks needed  little encouragement to enter with heartiness upon the real object of  the expedition, which was nothing less than the annexation of the  kingdom of Tunis. Three centuries had passed since the Sultans of the  race of Hafs had established their authority on the old Carthaginian  site, upon the breaking up of the African empire of the Almohades.  Their rule had been mild and just; they had maintained on the whole  friendly relations with the European powers, and many treaties record  the fair terms upon which the merchants of Pisa, Venice, and Genoa  were admitted to the port of Tunis. Saint Louis had been so struck  with the piety and justice of the king that he had even come to  convert him, and had died in the attempt. Twenty-one rulers of their  line had succeeded one another, till the vigour of the Ben[=i] Hafs  was sapped, and fraternal jealousies added bloodshed to weakness.  Hasan, the twenty-second, stepped to the throne over the bodies of  forty-four slaughtered brothers, and when he had thus secured his  place he set a pattern of vicious feebleness for all sovereigns to  avoid. A rival claimant served as the Corsair's pretext for invasion,  and Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n had hardly landed when this miserable wretch fled  the city, and though supported by some of the Arab tribes he could  make no head against the Turkish guns. Tunis, like Algiers, had been  added to the Ottoman Empire, against its will, and by the same  masterful hands. It may be doubted whether the Sultan's writ would  have run in either of his new provinces had their conqueror gainsaid  it.    [Illustration: TUNIS, 1566.    (_From a Map in the British Museum._)]    Tunis did not long remain in the possession of Barbarossa. The  banished king appealed to Charles V., and, whatever the emperor may  have thought of Hasan's wrongs, he plainly perceived that Barbarossa's  presence in Tunis harbour was a standing menace to his own kingdom of  Sicily. It was bad enough to see nests of pirates perched upon the  rocks of the Algerine coast; but Tunis was the key of the passage from  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22217"],[0,"My Reminiscences (#11)"],[1,"strict rules of conduct which he  prescribed for me in other respects.    Our first halt was to be for a few days at Bolpur. Satya had been there  a short time before with his parents. No self-respecting nineteenth  century infant would have credited the account of his travels which he  gave us on his return. But we were different, and had had no opportunity  of learning to determine the line between the possible and the  impossible. Our Mahabharata and Ramayana gave us no clue to it. Nor had  we then any children's illustrated books to guide us in the way a child  should go. All the hard and fast laws which govern the world we learnt  by knocking up against them.    Satya had told us that, unless one was very very expert, getting into a  railway carriage was a terribly dangerous affair--the least slip, and  it was all up. Then, again, a fellow had to hold on to his seat with all  his might, otherwise the jolt at starting was so tremendous there was no  telling where one would get thrown off to. So when we got to the railway  station I was all a-quiver. So easily did we get into our compartment,  however, that I felt sure the worst was yet to come. And when, at  length, we made an absurdly smooth start, without any semblance of  adventure, I felt woefully disappointed.    The train sped on; the broad fields with their blue-green border trees,  and the villages nestling in their shade flew past in a stream of  pictures which melted away like a flood of mirages. It was evening when  we reached Bolpur. As I got into the palanquin I closed my eyes. I  wanted to preserve the whole of the wonderful vision to be unfolded  before my waking eyes in the morning light. The freshness of the  experience would be spoilt, I feared, by incomplete glimpses caught in  the vagueness of the dusk.    When I woke at dawn my heart was thrilling tremulously as I stepped  outside. My predecessor had told me that Bolpur had one feature which  was to be found nowhere else in the world. This was the path leading  from the main buildings to the servants' quarters which, though not  covered over in any way, did not allow a ray of the sun or a drop of  rain to touch anybody passing along it. I started to hunt for this  wonderful path, but the reader will perhaps not wonder at my failure to  find it to this day.    Town bred as I was, I had never seen a rice-field, and I had a charming  portrait of the cowherd boy, of whom we had read, pictured on the canvas  of my imagination. I had heard from Satya that the Bolpur house was  surrounded by fields of ripening rice, and that playing in these with  cowherd boys was an everyday affair, of which the plucking, cooking and  eating of the rice was the crowning feature. I eagerly looked about me.  But where, oh, where was the rice-field on all that barren heath?  Cowherd boys there might have been somewhere about, yet how to  distinguish them from any other boys, that was the question!    However it did not take me long to get over what I could not see,--what  I did see was quite enough. There was no servant rule here, and the only  ring which encircled me was the blue of the horizon which the presiding  goddess of these solitudes had drawn round them. Within this I was free  to move about as I chose.    Though I was yet a mere child my father did not place any restriction on  my wanderings. In the hollows of the sandy soil the rainwater had  ploughed deep furrows, carving out miniature mountain ranges full of red  gravel and pebbles of various shapes through which ran tiny streams,  revealing the geography of Lilliput. From this region I would gather in  the lap of my tunic many curious pieces of stone and take the collection  to my father. He never made light of my labours. On the contrary he  waxed enthusiastic.    \"How wonderful!\" he exclaimed. \"Wherever did you get all these?\"    \"There are many many more, thousands and thousands!\" I burst out. \"I  could bring as many every day.\"    \"That _would_ be nice!\" he replied. \"Why not decorate my little hill  with them?\"    An attempt had been made to dig a tank in the garden, but the subsoil  water proving too low, it had been abandoned, unfinished, with the  excavated earth left piled up into a hillock. On the top of this height  my father used to sit for his morning prayer, and as he sat the sun  would rise at the edge of the undulating expanse which stretched away to  the eastern horizon in front of him. This was the hill he asked me to  decorate.    I was very troubled, on leaving Bolpur, that I could not carry away with  me my store of stones. It is still difficult for me to realise that I  have no absolute claim to keep up a close relationship with things,  merely because I have gathered them together. If my fate had granted me  the prayer, which I had pressed with such insistence, and undertaken  that I should carry this load of stones about with me for ever, then I  should scarcely have had the hardihood to laugh at it to-day.    In one of the ravines I came upon a hollow full of spring water which  overflowed as a little rivulet, where sported tiny fish battling their  way up the current.    \"I've found such a lovely spring,\" I told my father. \"Couldn't we get  our bathing and drinking water from there?\"    \"The very thing,\" he agreed, sharing my rapture, and gave orders for our  water supply to be drawn from that spring.    I was never tired of roaming about among those miniature hills and dales  in hopes of lighting on something never known before. I was the  Livingstone of this undiscovered land which looked as if seen through  the wrong end of a telescope. Everything there, the dwarf date palms,  the scrubby wild plums and the stunted jambolans, was in keeping with  the miniature mountain ranges, the little rivulet and the tiny fish I  had discovered.    [Illustration: Singing to My Father]    Probably in order to teach me to be careful my father placed a little  small change in my charge and required me to keep an account of it. He  also entrusted me with the duty of winding his valuable gold watch for  him. He overlooked the risk of damage in his desire to train me to a  sense of responsibility. When we went out together for our morning walk  he would ask me to give alms to any beggars we came across. But I never  could render him a proper account at the end of it. One day my balance  was larger than the account warranted.    \"I really must make you my cashier,\" observed my father. \"Money seems to  have a way of growing in your hands!\"    That watch of his I wound up with such indefatigable zeal that it had  very soon to be sent to the watchmaker's in Calcutta.    I am reminded of the time when, later in life, I was appointed to manage  the estate and had to lay before my father, owing to his failing  eye-sight, a statement of accounts on the second or third of every  month. I had first to read out the totals under each head, and if he had  any doubts on any point he would ask for the details. If I made any  attempt to slur over or keep out of sight any item which I feared he  would not like, it was sure to come out. So these first few days of the  month were very anxious ones for me.    As I have said, my father had the habit of keeping everything clearly  before his mind,--whether figures of accounts, or ceremonial  arrangements, or additions or alterations to property. He had never seen  the new prayer hall built at Bolpur, and yet he was familiar with every  detail of it from questioning those who came to see him after a visit to  Bolpur. He had an extraordinary memory, and when once he got hold of a  fact it never escaped him.    My father had marked his favourite verses in his copy of the  _Bhagavadgita_. He asked me to copy these out, with their translation,  for him. At home, I had been a boy of no account, but here, when these  important functions were entrusted to me, I felt the glory of the  situation.    By this time I was rid of my blue manuscript book and had got hold of a  bound volume of one of Lett's diaries. I now saw to it that my poetising  should not lack any of the dignity of outward circumstance. It was not  only a case of writing poems, but of holding myself forth as a poet  before my own imagination. So when I wrote poetry at Bolpur I loved to  do it sprawling under a young coconut palm. This seemed to me the true  poetic way. Resting thus on the hard unturfed gravel in the burning  heat of the day I composed a martial ballad on the \"Defeat of King  Prithwi.\" In spite of the superabundance of its martial spirit, it could  not escape an early death. That bound volume of Lett's diary has now  followed the way of its elder sister, the blue manuscript book, leaving  no address behind.    We left Bolpur and making short halts on the way at Sahebganj, Dinapore,  Allahabad and Cawnpore we stopped at last at Amritsar.    An incident on the way remains engraved on my memory. The train had  stopped at some big station. The ticket examiner came and punched our  tickets. He looked at me curiously as if he had some doubt which he did  not care to express. He went off and came back with a companion. Both of  them fidgetted about for a time near the door of our compartment and  then again retired. At last came the station master himself. He looked  at my half-ticket and then asked:    \"Is not the boy over twelve?\"    \"No,\" said my father.    I was then only eleven, but looked older than my age.    \"You must pay the full fare for him,\" said the station master.    My father's eyes flashed as, without a word, he took out a currency note  from his box and handed it to the station master. When they brought my  father his change he flung it disdainfully back at them, while the  station master stood abashed at this exposure of the meanness of his  implied doubt.    The golden temple of Amritsar comes back to me like a dream. Many a  morning have I accompanied my father to this _Gurudarbar_ of the Sikhs  in the middle of the"]]]
