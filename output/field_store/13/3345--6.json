The temptation to look far down into the valley was too  great for her, though, and she offered him the gift. The boy shook his  head, to Heidi's satisfaction.    \"What else do you want?\"    \"Money.\"    \"I have none, but Clara has some. How much must I give you?\"    \"Twenty pennies.\"    \"All right, but come.\"    While they were wandering down the street, Heidi found out what a  barrel-organ was, for she had never seen one. When they arrived before  an old church with a tower, Heidi was puzzled what to do next, but  having discovered a bell, she pulled it with all her might. The boy  agreed to wait for Heidi and show her the way home if she gave him a  double fee.    The lock creaked now from inside, and an old man opened the door. In  an angry voice, he said: \"How do you dare to ring for me? Can't you  see that it is only for those who want to see the tower?\"    \"But I do,\" said Heidi.    \"What do you want to see? Did anybody send you?\" asked the man.    \"No; but I want to look down from up there.\"    \"Get home and don't try it again.\" With that the tower-keeper was  going to shut the door, but Heidi held his coat-tails and pleaded with  him to let her come. The tower-keeper looked at the child's eyes,  which were nearly full of tears.    \"All right, come along, if you care so much,\" he said, taking her by  the hand. The two climbed up now many, many steps, which got narrower  all the time. When they had arrived on top, the old man lifted Heidi  up to the open window.    Heidi saw nothing but a sea of chimneys, roofs and towers, and her  heart sank. \"Oh, dear, it's different from the way I thought it would  be,\" she said.    \"There! what could such a little girl know about a view? We'll go down  now and you must promise never to ring at my tower any more.\"    On their way they passed an attic, where a large grey cat guarded her  new family in a basket. This cat caught half-a-dozen mice every day  for herself, for the old tower was full of rats and mice. Heidi gazed  at her in surprise, and was delighted when the old man opened the  basket.    \"What charming kittens, what cunning little creatures!\" she exclaimed  in her delight, when she saw them crawling about, jumping and  tumbling.    \"Would you like to have one?\" the old man asked.    \"For me? to keep?\" Heidi asked, for she could not believe her ears.    \"Yes, of course. You can have several if you have room for them,\" the  old man said, glad to find a good home for the kittens.    How happy Heidi was! Of course there was enough room in the huge  house, and Clara would be delighted when she saw the cunning things.    \"How can I take them with me?\" the child asked, after she had tried in  vain to catch one.    \"I can bring them to your house, if you tell me where you live,\" said  Heidi's new friend, while he caressed the old cat, who had lived with  him many years.    \"Bring them to Mr. Sesemann's house; there is a golden dog on the  door, with a ring in his mouth.\"    The old man had lived in the tower a long time and knew everybody;  Sebastian also was a special friend of his.    \"I know,\" he said. \"But to whom shall I send them? Do you belong to  Mr. Sesemann?\"    \"No. Please send them to Clara; she will like them, I am sure.\"    Heidi could hardly tear herself away from the pretty things, so the  old man put one kitten in each of her pockets to console her. After  that she went away.    The boy was waiting patiently for her, and when she had taken leave of  the tower-keeper, she asked the boy: \"Do you know where Mr. Sesemann's  house is?\"    \"No,\" was the reply.    She described it as well as she could, till the boy remembered it. Off  they started, and soon Heidi found herself pulling the door-bell. When  Sebastian arrived he said: \"Hurry up.\" Heidi went in, and the boy was  left outside, for Sebastian had not even seen him.    \"Come up quickly, little Miss,\" he urged. \"They are all waiting for  you in the dining-room. Miss Rottenmeier looks like a loaded cannon.  How could you run away like that?\"    Heidi sat down quietly on her chair. Nobody said a word, and there was  an uncomfortable silence. At last Miss Rottenmeier began with a severe  and solemn voice: \"I shall speak with you later, Adelheid. How can you  leave the house without a word? Your behavior was very remiss. The  idea of walking about till so late!\"    \"Meow!\" was the reply.    \"I didn't,\" Heidi began--\"Meow!\"    Sebastian nearly flung the dish on the table, and disappeared.    \"This is enough,\" Miss Rottenmeier tried to say, but her voice was  hoarse with fury. \"Get up and leave the room.\"    [Illustration: OFF THEY STARTED, AND SOON HEIDI WAS PULLING THE  DOOR-BELL]    Heidi got up. She began again. \"I made--\" \"Meow! meow! meow!--\"    \"Heidi,\" said Clara now, \"why do you always say 'meow' again, if you  see that Miss Rottenmeier is angry?\"    \"I am not doing it, it's the kittens,\" she explained.    \"What? Cats? Kittens?\" screamed the housekeeper. \"Sebastian, Tinette,  take the horrible things away!\" With that she ran into the study,  locking herself in, for she feared kittens beyond anything on earth.  When Sebastian had finished his laugh, he came into the room. He had  foreseen the excitement, having caught sight of the kittens when Heidi  came in. The scene was a very peaceful one now; Clara held the little  kittens in her lap, and Heidi was kneeling beside her. They both  played happily with the two graceful creatures. The butler promised to  look after the new-comers and prepared a bed for them in a basket.    A long time afterwards, when it was time to go to bed, Miss  Rottenmeier cautiously opened the door. \"Are they away?\" she asked.  \"Yes,\" replied the butler, quickly seizing the kittens and taking them  away.    The lecture that Miss Rottenmeier was going to give Heidi was  postponed to the following day, for the lady was too much exhausted  after her fright. They all went quietly to bed, and the children were  happy in the thought that their kittens had a comfortable bed.    [Illustration]          VIII    GREAT DISTURBANCES IN THE SESEMANN HOUSE      A short time after the tutor had arrived next morning, the door-bell  rang so violently that Sebastian thought it must be Mr. Sesemann  himself. What was his surprise when a dirty street-boy, with a  barrel-organ on his back, stood before him!    \"What do you mean by pulling the bell like that?\" the butler said.    \"I want to see Clara.\"    \"Can't you at least say 'Miss Clara', you ragged urchin?\" said  Sebastian harshly.    \"She owes me forty pennies,\" said the boy.    \"You are crazy! How do you know Miss Clara lives here?\"    \"I showed her the way yesterday and she promised to give me forty  pennies.\"    \"What nonsense! Miss Clara never goes out. You had better take  yourself off, before I send you!\"    The boy, however, did not even budge, and said: \"I saw her. She has  curly hair, black eyes and talks in a funny way.\"    \"Oh,\" Sebastian chuckled to himself, \"that was the little Miss.\"    Pulling the boy into the house, he said: \"All right, you can follow  me. Wait at the door till I call you, and then you can play something  for Miss Clara.\"    Knocking at the study-door, Sebastian said, when he had entered: \"A  boy is here who wants to see Miss Clara.\"    Clara, delighted at his interruption, said: \"Can't he come right up,  Mr. Candidate?\"    But the boy was already inside, and started to play. Miss Rottenmeier  was in the adjoining room when she heard the sounds. Where did they  come from? Hurrying into the study, she saw the street-boy playing to  the eager children.    \"Stop! stop!\" she called, but in vain, for the music drowned her  voice. Suddenly she made a big jump, for there, between her feet,  crawled a black turtle. Only when she shrieked for Sebastian could her  voice be heard. The butler came straight in, for he had seen  everything behind the door, and a great scene it had been! Glued to a  chair in her fright, Miss Rottenmeier called: \"Send the boy away! Take  them away!\"    Sebastian obediently pulled the boy after him; then he said: \"Here are  forty pennies from Miss Clara and forty more for playing. It was well  done, my boy.\"    With that he closed the door behind him. Miss Rottenmeier found it  wiser now to stay in the study to prevent further disturbances.  Suddenly there was another knock at the door. Sebastian appeared with  a large basket, which had been brought for Clara.    \"We had better have our lesson before we inspect it,\" said Miss  Rottenmeier. But Clara, turning to the tutor, asked: \"Oh, please, Mr.  Candidate, can't we just peep in, to see what it is?\"    \"I am afraid that you will think of nothing else,\" the teacher began.  Just then something in the basket, which had been only lightly  fastened, moved, and one, two, three and still more little kittens  jumped out, scampering around the room with the utmost speed. They  bounded over the tutor's boots and bit his trousers; they climbed up  on Miss Rottenmeier's dress and crawled around her feet. Mewing and  running, they caused a frightful confusion. Clara called out in  delight: \"Oh, look at the cunning creatures; look how they jump!  Heidi, look at that one, and oh, see the one over there?\"    Heidi followed them about, while the teacher shook them off. When the  housekeeper had collected her wits after the great fright, she called  for the servants. They soon arrived and stored the little kittens  safely in the new bed.    No time had been found for yawning that day, either!    When Miss Rottenmeier, who had found out the culprit, was alone with  the children in the evening, she began severely:    \"Adelheid, there is only one punishment for you. I am going to send  you to the cellar, to think over your dreadful misdeeds, in company  with the rats.\"    A cellar held no terrors for Heidi, for in her grandfather's cellar  fresh milk and the good cheese had been kept, and no rats had lodged"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20785"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#11)"],[1," wagon and some start gitting meat and corn  out of de place whar we done hid it to keep de scouters from finding  it befo' now. All de time we gitting ready to travel we hear dat boy  on dat horse going on down de big Texas road hollering.  \"Eya-a-a-he-he-hah!\"    Den jest as we starting to leave here come something across dat little  prairie sho' nuff! We know dey is Indians de way dey is riding, and de  way dey is all strung out. Dey had a flag, and it was all red and had  a big criss-cross on it dat look lak a saw horse. De man carry it and  rear back on it when de wind whip it, but it flap all 'round de  horse's head and de horse pitch and rear lak he know something going  happen, sho!    'Bout dat time it turn kind of dark and begin to rain a little, and we  git out to de big road and de rain come down hard. It rain so hard for  a little while dat we jest have to stop de wagon and set dar, and den  long come more soldiers dan I ever see befo'. Dey all white men, I  think, and dey have on dat brown clothes dyed wid walnut and  butternut, and old Master say dey de Confederate soldiers. Dey  dragging some big guns on wheels and most de men slopping 'long in de  rain on foot.    Den we hear de fighting up to de north 'long about what de river is,  and de guns sound lak hosses loping 'cross a plank bridge way off  somewhar. De head men start hollering and some de hosses start rearing  and de soldiers start trotting faster up de road. We can't git out on  de road so we jest strike off through de prairie and make for a creek  dat got high banks and a place on it we call Rocky Cliff.    We git in a big cave in dat cliff, and spend de whole day and dat  night in dar, and listen to de battle going on.    Dat place was about half-a-mile from de wagon depot at Honey Springs,  and a little east of it. We can hear de guns going all day, and along  in de evening here come de South side making for a getaway. Dey come  riding and running by whar we is, and it don't make no difference how  much de head men hollers at 'em dey can't make dat bunch slow up and  stop.    After while here come de Yankees, right after 'em, and dey goes on  into Honey Springs and pretty soon we see de blaze whar dey is burning  de wagon depot and de houses.    De next morning we goes back to de house and find de soldiers ain't  hurt nothing much. De hogs is whar dey is in de pen and de chickens  come cackling 'round too. Dem soldiers going so fast dey didn't have  no time to stop and take nothing, I reckon.    Den long come lots of de Yankee soldiers going back to de North, and  dey looks purty wore out, but dey is laughing and joshing and going  on.    Old Master pack up de wagon wid everything he can carry den, and we  strike out down de big road to git out de way of any more war, is dey  going be any.    Dat old Texas road jest crowded wid wagons! Everybody doing de same  thing we is, and de rains done made de road so muddy and de soldiers  done tromp up de mud so bad dat de wagons git stuck all de time.    De people all moving along in bunches, and every little while one  bunch of wagons come up wid another bunch all stuck in de mud, and dey  put all de hosses and mules on together and pull em out, and den dey  go on together awhile.    At night dey camp, and de women and what few niggers dey is have to  git de supper in de big pots, and de men so tired dey eat everything  up from de women and de niggers, purty nigh.    After while we come to de Canadian town. Dat whar old man Gouge been  and took a whole lot de folks up north wid him, and de South soldiers  got in dar ahead of us and took up all de houses to sleep in.    Dey was some of de white soldiers camped dar, and dey was singing at  de camp. I couldn't understand what dey sing, and I asked a Creek man  what dey say and he tell me dey sing, \"I wish I was in Dixie, look  away--look away.\"    I ask him whar dat is, and he laugh and talk to de soldiers and dey  all laugh, and make me mad.    De next morning we leave dat town and git to de big river. De rain  make de river rise, and I never see so much water! Jest look out dar  and dar all dat water!    Dey got some boats we put de stuff on, and float de wagons and swim de  mules and finally git across, but it look lak we gwine all drown.    Most de folks say dey going to Boggy Depot and around Fort Washita,  but old Master strike off by hisself and go way down in de bottom  somewhar to live.    I don't know whar it was, but dey been some kind of fighting all  around dar, 'cause we camp in houses and cabins all de time and nobody  live in any of 'em.    Look like de people all git away quick, 'cause all de stuff was in de  houses, but you better scout up around de house before you go up to  it. Liable to be some scouters already in it!    Dem Indian soldiers jest quit de army and lots went scouting in little  bunches and took everything dey find. Iffen somebody try to stop dem  dey git killed.    Sometime we find graves in de yard whar somebody jest been buried  fresh, and one house had some dead people in it when old Mistress poke  her head in it. We git away from dar, and no mistake!    By and by we find a little cabin and stop and stay all de time. I was  de only slave by dat time. All de others done slip out and run off. We  stay dar two year I reckon, 'cause we make two little crop of corn.  For meat a man name Mr. Walker wid us jest went out in de woods and  shoot de wild hogs. De woods was full of dem wild hogs, and lots of  fish in de holes whar he could sicken 'em wid buck root and catch 'em  wid his hands, all we wanted.    I don't know when de War quit off, and when I git free, but I stayed  wid old man Tuskaya-hiniha long time after I was free, I reckon. I was  jest a little girl, and he didn't know whar to send me to, anyways.    One day three men rid up and talk to de old man awhile in English  talk. Den he called me and tell me to go wid dem to find my own  family. He jest laugh and slap my behind and set me up on de hoss in  front of one de men and dey take me off and leave my good checkedy  dress at de house!    Before long we git to dat Canadian river again, and de men tie me on  de hoss so I can't fall off. Dar was all dat water, and dey ain't no  boat, and dey ain't no bridge, and we jest swim de hosses. I knowed  sho' I was going to be gone dat time, but we git across.    When we come to de Creek Agency dar is my pappy and my mammy to claim  me, and I live wid dem in de Verdigris bottom above Fort Gibson till I  was grown and dey is both dead. Den I marries Anderson Davis at Gibson  Station, and we git our allotments on de Verdigris east of Tulsa--kind  of south too, close to de Broken Arrow town.    I knowed old man Jim McHenry at dat Broken Arrow town. He done some  preaching and was a good old man, I think.    I knowed when dey started dat Wealaka school across de river from de  Broken Arrow town. Dey name it for de Wilaki town, but dat town was  way down in de Upper Creek country close to whar I lived when I was a  girl.    I had lots of children, but only two is alive now. My boy Anderson got  in a mess and went to dat McAlester prison, but he got to be a trusty  and dey let him marry a good woman dat got lots of property dar, and  dey living all right now.    When my old man die I come to live here wid Josephine, but I'se blind  and can't see nothing and all de noises pesters me a lot in de town.  And de children is all so ill mannered, too. Dey jest holler at you  all de time! Dey don't mind you neither!    When I could see and had my own younguns I could jest set in de corner  and tell 'em what to do, and iffen dey didn't do it right I could  whack 'em on de head, 'cause dey was raised de old Creek way, and dey  know de old folks know de best!

Owen St.,  Tulsa, Okla.          \"Run nigger, run,      De Patteroll git you!      Run nigger, run,      De Patteroll come!        \"Watch nigger, watch--      De Patteroll trick you!      Watch nigger, watch,      He got a big gun!\"    Dat one of the songs de slaves all knowed, and de children down on de  \"twenty acres\" used to sing it when dey playing in de moonlight 'round  de cabins in de quarters. Sometime I wonder iffen de white folks  didn't make dat song up so us niggers would keep in line.    None of my old Master's boys tried to git away 'cepting two, and dey  met up wid evil, both of 'em.    One of dem niggers was fotching a bull-tongue from a piece of new  ground way at de back of de plantation, and bringing it to my pappy to  git it sharped. My pappy was de blacksmith.    Dis boy got out in de big road to walk in de soft sand, and long come  a wagon wid a white overseer and five, six, niggers going somewhar.  Dey stopped and told dat boy to git in and ride. Dat was de last  anybody seen him.    Dat overseer and another one was cotched after awhile, and showed up  to be underground railroaders. Dey would take a bunch of niggers into  town for some excuse, and on de way jest pick up a extra nigger and  show him whar to go to git on de \"railroad system.\" When de runaway  niggers got to de North dey had to go in de army, and dat boy from our  place got killed. He was a good boy, but dey jest talked him into it.  Dem railroaders was honest, and dey didn't take no presents, but de  patrollers was low white trash!    We all knowed dat if a patroller jest rode right by and didn't say  nothing dat he was doing his honest job, but iffen he stopped his hoss  and talked to a nigger he was after some kind of trade.    Dat other black boy was hoeing cotton way in de back of de field and  de patroller rid up and down de big road, saying nothing to nobody.    De next day another white man was on de job, and long in de evening a  man come by and axed de niggers about de fishing and hunting! Dat  black boy seen he"]]]
