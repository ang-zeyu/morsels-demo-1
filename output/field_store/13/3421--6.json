One of the spirits of the air bore it at last far up above the top of  the highest mountain. \"It is mine,\" he cried. \"Never,\" said a spirit of  the water, and he caught it and threw it angrily against the rocky top  of the mountain. It fell in hundreds of pieces.    There was no vase like it in the east or the west, the north or the  south, and so the king of India never had an emerald vase; but from the  pieces of the vase that was thrown against the mountain came all the  emeralds that are now on the earth.          WHY THE EVERGREEN TREES NEVER LOSE THEIR LEAVES.      Winter was coming, and the birds had flown far to the south, where the  air was warm and they could find berries to eat. One little bird had  broken its wing and could not fly with the others. It was alone in the  cold world of frost and snow. The forest looked warm, and it made its  way to the trees as well as it could, to ask for help.    First it came to a birch-tree. \"Beautiful birch-tree,\" it said, \"my wing  is broken, and my friends have flown away. May I live among your  branches till they come back to me?\"    \"No, indeed,\" answered the birch-tree, drawing her fair green leaves  away. \"We of the great forest have our own birds to help. I can do  nothing for you.\"    \"The birch is not very strong,\" said the little bird to itself, \"and it  might be that she could not hold me easily. I will ask the oak.\" So the  bird said, \"Great oak-tree, you are so strong, will you not let me live  on your boughs till my friends come back in the springtime?\"    \"In the springtime!\" cried the oak. \"That is a long way off. How do I  know what you might do in all that time? Birds are always looking for  something to eat, and you might even eat up some of my acorns.\"    \"It may be that the willow will be kind to me,\" thought the bird, and it  said, \"Gentle willow, my wing is broken, and I could not fly to the  south with the other birds. May I live on your branches till the  springtime?\"    The willow did not look gentle then, for she drew herself up proudly and  said, \"Indeed, I do not know you, and we willows never talk to people  whom we do not know. Very likely there are trees somewhere that will  take in strange birds. Leave me at once.\"    The poor little bird did not know what to do. Its wing was not yet  strong, but it began to fly away as well as it could. Before it had  gone far, a voice was heard. \"Little bird,\" it said, \"where are you  going?\"    \"Indeed, I do not know,\" answered the bird sadly. \"I am very cold.\"    \"Come right here, then,\" said the friendly spruce-tree, for it was her  voice that had called. \"You shall live on my warmest branch all winter  if you choose.\"    \"Will you really let me?\" asked the little bird eagerly.    \"Indeed, I will,\" answered the kind-hearted spruce-tree. \"If your  friends have flown away, it is time for the trees to help you. Here is  the branch where my leaves are thickest and softest.\"    \"My branches are not very thick,\" said the friendly pine-tree, \"but I am  big and strong, and I can keep the north wind from you and the spruce.\"    \"I can help too,\" said a little juniper-tree. \"I can give you berries  all winter long, and every bird knows that juniper berries are good.\"    [Illustration]    So the spruce gave the lonely little bird a home, the pine kept the cold  north wind away from it, and the juniper gave it berries to eat.    The other trees looked on and talked together wisely.    \"I would not have strange birds on my boughs,\" said the birch.    \"I shall not give my acorns away for any one,\" said the oak.    \"I never have anything to do with strangers,\" said the willow, and the  three trees drew their leaves closely about them.    In the morning all those shining green leaves lay on the ground, for a  cold north wind had come in the night, and every leaf that it touched  fell from the tree.    \"May I touch every leaf in the forest?\" asked the wind in its frolic.    \"No,\" said the frost king. \"The trees that have been kind to the little  bird with the broken wing may keep their leaves.\"    This is why the leaves of the spruce, the pine, and the juniper are  always green.          WHY THE ASPEN LEAVES TREMBLE.      \"It is very strange,\" whispered one reed to another, \"that the queen bee  never guides her swarm to the aspen-tree.\"    \"Indeed, it _is_ strange,\" said the other. \"The oak and the willow often  have swarms, but I never saw one on the aspen. What can be the reason?\"    \"The queen bee cannot bear the aspen,\" said the first. \"Very likely she  has some good reason for despising it. I do not think that an insect as  wise as she would despise a tree without any reason. Many wicked things  happen that no one knows.\"    The reeds did not think that any one could hear what they said, but both  the willow and the aspen heard every word. The aspen was so angry that  it trembled from root to tip. \"I'll soon see why that proud queen bee  despises me,\" it said. \"She shall guide a swarm to my branches or\"--    \"Oh, I would not care for what those reeds say,\" the willow-tree broke  in. \"They are the greatest chatterers in the world. They are always  whispering together, and they always have something unkind to say.\"    The aspen-tree was too angry to be still, and it called out to the  reeds, \"You are only lazy whisperers. I do not care what you say. I  despise both you and your queen bee. The honey that those bees make is  not good to eat. I would not have it a anywhere near me.\"    \"Hush, hush,\" whispered the willow timidly. \"The reeds will repeat every  word that you say.\"    \"I do not care if they do,\" said the aspen. \"I despise both them and the  bees.\"    The reeds did whisper the angry words of the aspen to the queen bee, and  she said, \"I was going to guide my swarm to the aspen, but now I will  drive the tree out of the forest. Come, my bees, come.\"    Then the bees flew by hundreds upon the aspen. They stung every leaf and  every twig through and through. The tree was driven from the forest,  over the prairie, over the river, over the fields; and still the angry  bees flew after it and stung it again and again. When they had come to  the rocky places, they left it and flew back to the land of flowers. The  aspen never came back. Its bright green leaves had grown white through  fear, and from that day to this they have trembled as they did when the  bees were stinging them and driving the tree from the forest.          HOW THE BLOSSOMS CAME TO THE HEATHER.      Only a little while after the earth was made, the trees and plants came  to live on it. They were happy and contented. The lily was glad because  her flowers were white. The rose was glad because her flowers were red.  The violet was happy because, however shyly she might hide herself away,  some one would come to look for her and praise her fragrance. The daisy  was happiest of all because every child in the world loved her.    The trees and plants chose homes for themselves. The oak said, \"I will  live in the broad fields and by the roads, and travelers may sit in my  shadow.\" \"I shall be contented on the waters of the pond,\" said the  water-lily. \"And I am contented in the sunny fields,\" said the daisy.  \"My fragrance shall rise from beside some mossy stone,\" said the violet.  Each plant chose its home where it would be most happy and contented.    There was one little plant, however, that had not said a word and had  not chosen a home. This plant was the heather. She had not the sweet  fragrance of the violet, and the children did not love her as they did  the daisy. The reason was that no blossoms had been given to her, and  she was too shy to ask for any.    \"I wish there was some one who would be glad to see me,\" she said; but  she was a brave little plant, and she did her best to be contented and  to look bright and green.    One day she heard the mountain say, \"Dear plants, will you not come to  my rocks and cover them with your brightness and beauty? In the winter  they are cold, and in the summer they are stung by the sunshine. Will  you not come and cover them?\"    \"I cannot leave the pond,\" cried the water-lily.    \"I cannot leave the moss,\" said the violet.    \"I cannot leave the green fields,\" said the daisy.    The little heather was really trembling with eagerness. \"If the great,  beautiful mountain would only let me come!\" she thought, and at last she  whispered very softly and shyly, \"Please, dear mountain, will you let me  come? I have not any blossoms like the others, but I will try to keep  the wind and the sun away from you.\"    \"Let you?\" cried the mountain. \"I shall be contented and happy if a dear  little plant like you will only come to me.\"    The heather soon covered the rocky mountain side with her bright green,  and the mountain called proudly to the other plants, \"See how beautiful  my little heather is!\" The others replied, \"Yes, she is bright and  green, but she has no blossoms.\"    Then a sweet, gentle voice was heard saying, \"Blossoms you shall have,  little heather. You shall have many and many a flower, because you have  loved the lonely mountain, and have done all that you could to please  him and make him happy.\" Even before the sweet voice was still, the  little heather was bright with many blossoms, and blossoms she has had  from that day to this.          HOW FLAX WAS GIVEN TO MEN.      \"You have been on the mountain a long time,\" said the wife of the  hunter.    \"Yes, wife, and I have seen the most marvelous sight in all the world,\"  replied the hunter.    \"What was that?\"    \"I came to a place on the mountain where I had been many and many a time  before, but a great hole had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22430"],[0,"Evolution in Modern Thought (#11)"],[1,"by personal selection, and therefore in  their case alone can we form any idea of how the primary constituents  behave, when they are subject solely to intra-germinal forces_.    The whole determinant system of an id, as I conceive it, is in a state  of continual fluctuation upwards and downwards. In most cases the  fluctuations will counteract one another, because the passive streams  of nutriment soon change, but in many cases the limit from which a  return is possible will be passed, and then the determinants concerned  will continue to vary in the same direction, till they attain positive  or negative selection-value. At this stage personal selection  intervenes and sets aside the variation if it is disadvantageous, or  favours--that is to say, preserves--it if it is advantageous. Only  _the determinant of a useless organ is uninfluenced by personal  selection_, and, as experience shows, it sinks downwards; that is, the  organ that corresponds to it degenerates very slowly but  uninterruptedly till, after what must obviously be an immense stretch  of time, it disappears from the germ-plasm altogether.    Thus we find in the fact of the degeneration of disused parts the  proof that not all the fluctuations of a determinant return to  equilibrium again, but that, when the movement has attained to a  certain strength, it continues _in the same direction_. We have entire  certainty in regard to this as far as the downward progress is  concerned, and we must assume it also in regard to ascending  variations, as the phenomena of artificial selection certainly justify  us in doing. If the Japanese breeders were able to lengthen the  tail-feathers of the cock to six feet, it can only have been because  the determinants of the tail-feathers in the germ-plasm had already  struck out a path of ascending variation, and this movement was taken  advantage of by the breeder, who continually selected for reproduction  the individuals in which the ascending variation was most marked. For  all breeding depends upon the unconscious selection of germinal  variations.    Of course these germinal processes cannot be proved mathematically,  since we cannot actually see the play of forces of the passive  fluctuations and their causes. We cannot say how great these  fluctuations are, and how quickly or slowly, how regularly or  irregularly they change. Nor do we know how far a determinant must be  strengthened by the passive flow of the nutritive stream if it is to  be beyond the danger of unfavourable variations, or how far it must be  weakened passively before it loses the power of recovering itself by  its own strength. It is no more possible to bring forward actual  proofs in this case than it was in regard to the selection-value of  the initial stages of an adaptation. But if we consider that all  heritable variations must have their roots in the germ-plasm, and  further, that when personal selection does not intervene, that is to  say, in the case of parts which have become useless, a degeneration of  the part, and therefore also of its determinant must inevitably take  place; then we must conclude that processes such as I have assumed are  running their course within the germ-plasm, and we can do this with as  much certainty as we were able to infer, from the phenomena of  adaptation, the selection-value of their initial stages. The fact of  the degeneration of disused parts seems to me to afford irrefutable  proof that the fluctuations within the germ-plasm _are the real root  of all hereditary variation_, and the preliminary condition for the  occurrence of the Darwin-Wallace factor of selection. Germinal  selection supplies the stones out of which personal selection builds  her temples and palaces: _adaptations_. The importance for the theory  of the process of degeneration of disused parts cannot be  over-estimated, especially when it occurs in sterile animal forms,  where we are free from the doubt as to the alleged _Lamarckian factor_  which is apt to confuse our ideas in regard to other cases.    If we regard the variation of the many determinants concerned in the  transformation of the female into the sterile worker as having come  about through the gradual transformation of the ids into worker-ids,  we shall see that the germ-plasm of the sexual ants must contain three  kinds of ids, male, female, and worker ids, or if the workers have  diverged into soldiers and nest-builders, then four kinds. We  understand that the worker-ids arose because their determinants struck  out a useful path of variation, whether upward or downward, and that  they continued in this path until the highest attainable degree of  utility of the parts determined was reached. But in addition to the  organs of positive or negative selection-value, there were some which  were indifferent as far as the success and especially the functional  capacity of the workers was concerned: wings, ovarian tubes,  _receptaculum seminis_, a number of the facets of the eye, perhaps  even the whole eye. As to the ovarian tubes it is is possible that  their degeneration was an advantage for the workers, in saving energy,  and if so selection would favour the degeneration; but how could the  presence of eyes diminish the usefulness of the workers to the colony?  or the minute _receptaculum seminis_, or even the wings? These parts  have therefore degenerated _because they were of no further value to  the insect_. But if selection did not influence the setting aside of  these parts because they were neither of advantage nor of disadvantage  to the species, then the Darwinian factor of selection is here  confronted with a puzzle which it cannot solve alone, but which at  once becomes clear when germinal selection is added. For the  determinants of organs that have no further value for the organism,  must, as we have already explained, embark on a gradual course of  retrograde development.    In ants the degeneration has gone so far that there are no  wing-rudiments present in _any_ species, as is the case with so many  butterflies, flies, and locusts, but in the larvae the imaginable  discs of the wings are still laid down. With regard to the ovaries,  degeneration has reached different levels in different species of  ants, as has been shown by the researches of my former pupil,  Elizabeth Bickford. In many species there are twelve ovarian tubes,  and they decrease from that number to one; indeed, in one species no  ovarian tube at all is present. So much at least is certain from what  has been said, that in this case _everything_ depends on the  fluctuations of the elements of the germ-plasm. Germinal selection,  here as elsewhere, presents the variations of the determinants, and  personal selection favours or rejects these, or,--if it be a question  of organs which have become useless,--it does not come into play at  all, and allows the descending variation free course.    It is obvious that even the problem of _coadaptation in sterile  animals_ can thus be satisfactorily explained. If the determinants are  oscillating upwards and downwards in continual fluctuation, and  varying more pronouncedly now in one direction now in the other,  useful variations of every determinant will continually present  themselves anew, and may, in the course of generations, be combined  with one another in various ways. But there is one character of the  determinants that greatly facilitates this complex process of  selection, that, after a certain limit has been reached, they go on  varying in the same direction. From this it follows that development  along a path once struck out may proceed without the continual  intervention of personal selection. This factor only operates, so to  speak, at the beginning, when it selects the determinants which are  varying in the right direction, and again at the end, when it is  necessary to put a check upon further variation. In addition to this,  enormously long periods have been available for all these adaptations,  as the very gradual transition stages between females and workers in  many species plainly show, and thus this process of transformation  loses the marvellous and mysterious character that seemed at the first  glance to invest it, and takes rank, without any straining, among the  other processes of selection. It seems to me that, from the facts that  sterile animal forms can adapt themselves to new vital functions,  their superfluous parts degenerate, and the parts more used adapt  themselves in an ascending direction, those less used in a descending  direction, we must draw the conclusion that harmonious adaptation here  comes about _without the cooeperation of the Lamarckian principle_.  This conclusion once established, however, we have no reason to refer  the thousands of cases of harmonious adaptation, which occur in  exactly the same way among other animals or plants, to a principle,  the _active intervention of which in the transformation of species is  nowhere proved. We do not require it to explain the facts, and  therefore we must not assume it._    The fact of coadaptation, which was supposed to furnish the strongest  argument against the principle of selection, in reality yields the  clearest evidence in favour of it. We _must_ assume it, _because no  other possibility of explanation is open to us, and because these  adaptations actually exist, that is to say, have really taken place_.  With this conviction I attempted, as far back as 1894, when the idea  of germinal selection had not yet occurred to me, to make \"harmonious  adaptation\" (coadaptation) more easily intelligible in some way or  other, and so I was led to the idea, which was subsequently expounded  in detail by Baldwin, and Lloyd Morgan, and also by Osborn, and Gulick  as _Organic Selection_. It seemed to me that it was not necessary that  all the germinal variations required for secondary variations should  have occurred _simultaneously_, since, for"]]]
