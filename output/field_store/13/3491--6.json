We had  cleared and drained and redeemed the swamp and made it into a garden,  and I had built me a lodge there. The weasel's hunting-grounds, where  doubtless he had been wont to gather his supply of mice, had been  destroyed, and he had \"got even\" with me by preying upon my young  chickens. Night after night the number of chickens grew less, till one  day we chanced to see the creature boldly chasing one of the larger  fowls along the road near the henhouse. His career was cut short then  and there by one of the men. We were then ignorant of the den in the  bank a few yards away. The next season my chickens were preyed upon  again; they were killed upon the roost, and their half-eaten bodies were  found under the floor. One night I was awakened about midnight by that  loud, desperate cry which a barn fowl gives when suddenly seized upon  its roost. Was I dreaming, or was that a cry of murder from my  chickens? I seized my lantern, and with my dog rushed out to where a  pair of nearly grown roosters passed the nights upon a low stump. They  were both gone, and the action of the dog betrayed the fresh scent of  some animal. But we could get no clue to the chickens or their enemy. I  felt sure that only one of the fowls had been seized, and that the other  had dashed away wildly in the darkness, which proved to be the case. The  dead chicken was there under the edge of the stump, where I found it in  the morning, and its companion came forth unhurt during the day.  Thenceforth the chickens, big and little, were all shut up in the  henhouse at night. On the third day the appetite of the weasel was keen  again, and it boldly gave chase to a chicken before our eyes. I was  standing in my porch with my dog, talking with my neighbor and his wife,  who, with their dog, were standing in the road a few yards in front of  me. A chicken suddenly screamed in the bushes up behind the rocks just  beyond my friends. Then it came rushing down over the rocks past them,  flying and screaming, closely pursued by a long, slim red animal, that  seemed to slide over the rocks like a serpent. Its legs were so short  that one saw only the swift, gliding motion of its body. Across the road  into the garden, within a yard of my friends, went the pursued and the  pursuer, and into the garden rushed I and my dog. The weasel seized the  chicken by the wing, and was being dragged along by the latter in its  effort to escape, when I arrived upon the scene. With a savage glee I  had not felt for many a day, I planted my foot upon the weasel. The soft  muck underneath yielded, and I held him without hurting him. He let go  his hold upon the chicken and seized the sole of my shoe in his teeth.  Then I reached down and gripped him with my thumb and forefinger just  back of the ears, and lifted him up, and looked his impotent rage in the  face. What gleaming eyes, what an array of threatening teeth, what  reaching of vicious claws, what a wriggling and convulsed body! But I  held him firmly. He could only scratch my hand and dart fire from his  electric, bead-like eyes. In the mean time my dog was bounding up,  begging to be allowed to have his way with the weasel. But I knew what  he did not: I knew that in anything like a fair encounter the weasel  would get the first hold, would draw the first blood, and hence probably  effect his escape. So I carried the animal, writhing and scratching, to  a place in the road removed from any near cover, and threw him violently  upon the ground, hoping thereby so to stun and bewilder him that the  terrier could rush in and crush him before he recovered his wits. But I  had miscalculated; the blow did indeed stun and confuse him, but he was  still too quick for the dog, and had him by the lip like an electric  trap. Nip lifted up his head and swung the weasel violently about in the  air, trying to shake him off, uttering a cry of rage and pain, but did  not succeed in loosening the animal's hold for some moments. When he had  done so, and attempted to seize him a second time, the weasel was first  again, but quickly released his hold and darted about this way and that,  seeking cover. Three or four times the dog was upon him, but found him  each time too hot to be held. Seeing that the creature was likely to  escape, I set my foot upon him again, and made a finish of him.    The weasel is the boldest and most bloodthirsty of our small mammals;  indeed, none of our larger beasts are more so. There is something  devilish and uncanny about it. It persists like fate; it eludes, but  cannot be eluded. The terror it inspires in the smaller creatures--rats,  rabbits, chipmunks--is pitiful to behold. A rat pursued by a weasel has  been known to rush into a room, uttering dismal cries, and seek the  protection of a man in bed. A chipmunk will climb to the top of a tall  tree to elude it, and then, when followed, let go its hold and drop  with a cry of despair toward the ground. A friend of mine, walking along  the road early one morning, saw a rat rush over the fence and cross a  few yards ahead of him. Pressing it close came a weasel, which seized  the rat before it could gain the opposite wall. My friend rushed to the  aid of the rat with his cane. But the weasel dodged his blows, and in a  moment or two turned fiercely upon him. My friend aimed more blows at it  without effect, when the weasel began leaping up before him, within a  few feet of his face, its eyes gleaming, its teeth threatening, and  dodging every blow aimed at it. The effect, my friend says, was  singularly uncanny and startling. It was like some infuriated imp of  Satan dancing before him, and watching for a chance to seize him by the  throat or to dash into his eyes. He slowly backed off, beating the air  with his cane. Then the weasel returned to the disabled rat and  attempted to drag it into the wall. My friend now began to hurl stones  at it, but it easily dodged them. Now he was joined by another  passer-by, and the two opened upon the weasel with stones, till finally,  in dodging one, it was caught by the other, and so much hurt that it  gave up the rat and sought shelter in the wall, where it was left  waiting to secure its game when its enemies should have gone on.    I must give one more instance of the boldness and ferocity of the  weasel. A woman in northern Vermont discovered that something was  killing her hens, often on the nest. She watched for the culprit, and at  last caught a weasel in the act. It had seized the hen, and refused to  let go when she tried to scare it away. Then the woman laid hold of it  and tried choking it, when the weasel released its hold upon the hen and  fastened its teeth into her hand between the thumb and forefinger. She  could not choke it off, and ran to a neighbor for help, but no one could  remove it without tearing the flesh from the woman's hand. Then some one  suggested a pail of water; into this the hand and weasel were plunged,  but the creature would not let go even then, and did not until it was  drowned.    The weasel is a subtle and destructive enemy of the birds. It climbs  trees and explores them with great ease and nimbleness. I have seen it  do so on several occasions. One day my attention was arrested by the  angry notes of a pair of brown thrashers that were flitting from bush to  bush along an old stone wall in a remote field. Presently I saw what it  was that excited them,--three large red weasels, or ermines, coming  along the stone wall, and leisurely and half playfully exploring every  tree that stood near it. They had probably robbed the thrashers. They  would go up the trees with great ease, and glide serpent-like out upon  the main branches. When they descended the tree, they were unable to  come straight down, like a squirrel, but went around it spirally. How  boldly they thrust their heads out of the wall, and eyed me and sniffed  me as I drew near,--their round, thin ears, their prominent, glistening,  bead-like eyes, and the curving, snake-like motions of the head and neck  being very noticeable. They looked like blood-suckers and egg-suckers.  They suggested something extremely remorseless and cruel. One could  understand the alarm of the rats when they discover one of these  fearless, subtle, and circumventing creatures threading their holes. To  flee must be like trying to escape death itself. I was one day standing  in the woods upon a flat stone, in what at certain seasons was the bed  of a stream, when one of these weasels came undulating along and ran  under the stone upon which I was standing. As I remained motionless, he  thrust out his wedge-shaped head, and turned it back above the stone as  if half in mind to seize my foot; then he drew back, and presently went  his way. These weasels often hunt in packs like the British stoat. When  I was a boy, my father one day armed me with an old musket and sent me  to shoot chipmunks around the corn. While watching the squirrels, a  troop of weasels tried to cross a bar-way where I sat, and were so bent  on doing it that I fired at them, boy-like, simply to thwart their  purpose. One of the weasels was disabled by my shot, but the troop was  not discouraged, and, after making several feints to cross, one of them  seized the wounded one and bore it over, and the pack disappeared in the  wall on the other side.    Let me conclude this chapter with two or three more notes about this  alert enemy of the birds and lesser animals, the weasel.    A farmer one day heard a queer growling sound in the grass: on  approaching the spot he saw two weasels contending over a mouse; both  held the mouse, pulling in opposite directions, and they were so  absorbed in the struggle that the farmer cautiously put his hands down  and grabbed them both by the back of the neck. He put them in a cage,  and offered them bread and other food. This they refused to eat, but in  a few days one of them had eaten"]]]
