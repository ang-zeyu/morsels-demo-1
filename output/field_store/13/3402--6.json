The little man started and turned his malignant eyes upon my friend.    \"I have to thank you for a good deal,\" said he. \"Perhaps I'll pay my  debt some day.\"    Holmes smiled indulgently.    \"I fancy that for some few years you will find your time very fully  occupied,\" said he. \"By the way, what was it you put into the wood-pile  besides your old trousers? A dead dog, or rabbits, or what? You won't  tell? Dear me, how very unkind of you! Well, well, I dare say that a  couple of rabbits would account both for the blood and for the charred  ashes.

By ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE.          III.--The Adventure of the Dancing Men.      HOLMES had been seated for some hours in silence with his long,  thin back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a  particularly malodorous product. His head was sunk upon his breast, and  he looked from my point of view like a strange, lank bird, with dull  grey plumage and a black top-knot.    \"So, Watson,\" said he, suddenly, \"you do not propose to invest in South  African securities?\"    I gave a start of astonishment. Accustomed as I was to Holmes's curious  faculties, this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was  utterly inexplicable.    \"How on earth do you know that?\" I asked.    He wheeled round upon his stool, with a steaming test-tube in his hand  and a gleam of amusement in his deep-set eyes.    \"Now, Watson, confess yourself utterly taken aback,\" said he.    \"I am.\"    \"I ought to make you sign a paper to that effect.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly  simple.\"    \"I am sure that I shall say nothing of the kind.\"    \"You see, my dear Watson\"--he propped his test-tube in the rack and  began to lecture with the air of a professor addressing his class--\"it  is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences, each  dependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself. If, after  doing so, one simply knocks out all the central inferences and presents  one's audience with the starting-point and the conclusion, one may  produce a startling, though possibly a meretricious, effect. Now, it was  not really difficult, by an inspection of the groove between your left  forefinger and thumb, to feel sure that you did NOT propose to invest  your small capital in the goldfields.\"    \"I see no connection.\"    \"Very likely not; but I can quickly show you a close connection. Here  are the missing links of the very simple chain: 1. You had chalk between  your left finger and thumb when you returned from the club last night.  2. You put chalk there when you play billiards to steady the cue. 3. You  never play billiards except with Thurston. 4. You told me four weeks ago  that Thurston had an option on some South African property which would  expire in a month, and which he desired you to share with him. 5. Your  cheque-book is locked in my drawer, and you have not asked for the key.  6. You do not propose to invest your money in this manner.\"    \"How absurdly simple!\" I cried.    \"Quite so!\" said he, a little nettled. \"Every problem becomes very  childish when once it is explained to you. Here is an unexplained one.  See what you can make of that, friend Watson.\" He tossed a sheet of  paper upon the table and turned once more to his chemical analysis.    I looked with amazement at the absurd hieroglyphics upon the paper.    \"Why, Holmes, it is a child's drawing,\" I cried.    \"Oh, that's your idea!\"    \"What else should it be?\"    \"That is what Mr. Hilton Cubitt, of Riding Thorpe Manor, Norfolk, is  very anxious to know. This little conundrum came by the first post, and  he was to follow by the next train. There's a ring at the bell, Watson.  I should not be very much surprised if this were he.\"    A heavy step was heard upon the stairs, and an instant later there  entered a tall, ruddy, clean-shaven gentleman, whose clear eyes and  florid cheeks told of a life led far from the fogs of Baker Street. He  seemed to bring a whiff of his strong, fresh, bracing, east-coast air  with him as he entered. Having shaken hands with each of us, he was  about to sit down when his eye rested upon the paper with the curious  markings, which I had just examined and left upon the table.    \"Well, Mr. Holmes, what do you make of these?\" he cried. \"They told me  that you were fond of queer mysteries, and I don't think you can find a  queerer one than that. I sent the paper on ahead so that you might have  time to study it before I came.\"    \"It is certainly rather a curious production,\" said Holmes. \"At first  sight it would appear to be some childish prank. It consists of a number  of absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon which they  are drawn. Why should you attribute any importance to so grotesque an  object?\"    \"I never should, Mr. Holmes. But my wife does. It is frightening her to  death. She says nothing, but I can see terror in her eyes. That's why I  want to sift the matter to the bottom.\"    Holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it. It was  a page torn from a note-book. The markings were done in pencil, and ran  in this way:--    GRAPHIC    Holmes examined it for some time, and then, folding it carefully up, he  placed it in his pocket-book.    \"This promises to be a most interesting and unusual case,\" said he.  \"You gave me a few particulars in your letter, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, but I  should be very much obliged if you would kindly go over it all again for  the benefit of my friend, Dr. Watson.\"    \"I'm not much of a story-teller,\" said our visitor, nervously clasping  and unclasping his great, strong hands. \"You'll just ask me anything  that I don't make clear. I'll begin at the time of my marriage last  year; but I want to say first of all that, though I'm not a rich man, my  people have been at Ridling Thorpe for a matter of five centuries, and  there is no better known family in the County of Norfolk. Last year I  came up to London for the Jubilee, and I stopped at a boarding-house in  Russell Square, because Parker, the vicar of our parish, was staying in  it. There was an American young lady there--Patrick was the name--Elsie  Patrick. In some way we became friends, until before my month was up  I was as much in love as a man could be. We were quietly married at  a registry office, and we returned to Norfolk a wedded couple. You'll  think it very mad, Mr. Holmes, that a man of a good old family should  marry a wife in this fashion, knowing nothing of her past or of her  people; but if you saw her and knew her it would help you to understand.    \"She was very straight about it, was Elsie. I can't say that she did not  give me every chance of getting out of it if I wished to do so. 'I have  had some very disagreeable associations in my life,' said she; 'I wish  to forget all about them. I would rather never allude to the past, for  it is very painful to me. If you take me, Hilton, you will take a woman  who has nothing that she need be personally ashamed of; but you will  have to be content with my word for it, and to allow me to be silent  as to all that passed up to the time when I became yours. If these  conditions are too hard, then go back to Norfolk and leave me to the  lonely life in which you found me.' It was only the day before our  wedding that she said those very words to me. I told her that I was  content to take her on her own terms, and I have been as good as my  word.    \"Well, we have been married now for a year, and very happy we have been.  But about a month ago, at the end of June, I saw for the first time  signs of trouble. One day my wife received a letter from America. I saw  the American stamp. She turned deadly white, read the letter, and threw  it into the fire. She made no allusion to it afterwards, and I made  none, for a promise is a promise; but she has never known an easy hour  from that moment. There is always a look of fear upon her face--a look  as if she were waiting and expecting. She would do better to trust me.  She would find that I was her best friend. But until she speaks I can  say nothing. Mind you, she is a truthful woman, Mr. Holmes, and whatever  trouble there may have been in her past life it has been no fault of  hers. I am only a simple Norfolk squire, but there is not a man in  England who ranks his family honour more highly than I do. She knows it  well, and she knew it well before she married me. She would never bring  any stain upon it--of that I am sure.    \"Well, now I come to the queer part of my story. About a week ago--it  was the Tuesday of last week--I found on one of the window-sills a  number of absurd little dancing figures, like these upon the paper. They  were scrawled with chalk. I thought that it was the stable-boy who had  drawn them, but the lad swore he knew nothing about it. Anyhow, they had  come there during the night. I had them washed out, and I only mentioned  the matter to my wife afterwards. To my surprise she took it very  seriously, and begged me if any more came to let her see them. None did  come for a week, and then yesterday morning I found this paper lying on  the sun-dial in the garden. I showed it to Elsie, and down she dropped  in a dead faint. Since then she has looked like a woman in a dream, half  dazed, and with terror always lurking in her eyes. It was then that I  wrote and sent the paper to you, Mr. Holmes. It was not a thing that  I could take to the police, for they would have laughed at me, but you  will tell me what to do. I am not a rich man; but if there is any danger  threatening my little woman I would spend my last copper to shield"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22101"],[0,"Wood Folk at School (#11)"],[1,"where I had stood when his deep  _Hoowuff!_ first startled me I left a big salmon, for a taste of which  any bear will go far out of his way. Next morning it was gone; and so it  may be that Mooween, on his next journey, found another and a pleasanter  surprise awaiting him at the turn of the trail.    [Illustration]          Quoskh the Keen Eyed    [Illustration]      Sometimes, at night, as you drift along the shore in your canoe, sifting  the night sounds and smells of the wilderness, when all harsher cries  are hushed and the silence grows tense and musical, like a great  stretched chord over which the wind is thrumming low suggestive  melodies, a sudden rush and flapping in the grasses beside you breaks  noisily into the gamut of half-heard primary tones and rising, vanishing  harmonics. Then, as you listen, and before the silence has again  stretched the chords of her Eolian harp tight enough for the wind's  fingers, another sound, a cry, comes floating down from the  air--_Quoskh? quoskh-quoskh?_ a wild, questioning call, as if the  startled night were asking who you are. It is only a blue heron, wakened  out of his sleep on the shore by your noisy approach, that you thought  was still as the night itself. He circles over your head for a moment,  seeing you perfectly, though you catch never a shadow of his broad  wings; then he vanishes into the vast, dark silence, crying _Quoskh?  quoskh?_ as he goes. And the cry, with its strange, wild interrogation  vanishing away into the outer darkness, has given him his most  fascinating Indian name, Quoskh the Night's Question.    To many, indeed, even to some Indians, he has no other name and no  definite presence. He rarely utters the cry by day--his voice then is a  harsh croak--and you never see him as he utters it out of the solemn  upper darkness; so that there is often a mystery about this voice of the  night, which one never thinks of associating with the quiet, patient,  long-legged fisherman that one may see any summer day along the borders  of lonely lake or stream. A score of times I have been asked by old  campers, \"What is that?\" as a sharp, questioning _Quoskh-quoskh?_ seemed  to tumble down into the sleeping lake. Yet they knew the great blue  heron perfectly--or thought they did.    Quoskh has other names, however, which describe his attributes and  doings. Sometimes, when fishing alongshore with my Indian at the paddle,  the canoe would push its nose silently around a point, and I would see  the heron's heavy slanting flight already halfway up to the tree-tops,  long before our coming had been suspected by the watchful little mother  sheldrake, or even by the deer feeding close at hand among the lily  pads. Then Simmo, who could never surprise one of the great birds  however silently he paddled, would mutter something which sounded like  _Quoskh K'sobeqh_, Quoskh the Keen Eyed. At other times, when we noticed  him spearing frogs with his long bill, Simmo, who could not endure the  sight of a frog's leg on my fry pan, would speak of him disdainfully in  his own musical language as Quoskh the Frog Eater, for my especial  benefit. Again, if I stopped casting suddenly at the deep trout pool  opposite a grassy shore, to follow with my eyes a tall, gray-blue shadow  on stilts moving dimly alongshore in seven-league-boot strides for the  next bog, where frogs were plenty, Simmo would point with his paddle and  say: \"See, Ol' Fader Longlegs go catch-um more frogs for his babies.  Funny kin' babies dat, eat-um bullfrog; don' chu tink so?\"    Of all his names--and there were many more that I picked up from  watching him in a summer's outing--\"Old Father Longlegs\" seemed always  the most appropriate. There is a suggestion of hoary antiquity about  this solemn wader of our lakes and streams. Indeed, of all birds he is  the nearest to those ancient, uncouth monsters which Nature made to  people our earth in its uncouth infancy. Other herons and bitterns have  grown smaller and more graceful, with shorter legs and necks, to suit  our diminishing rivers and our changed landscape. Quoskh is also,  undoubtedly, much smaller than he once was; but still his legs and neck  are disproportionately long, when one thinks of the waters he wades and  the nest he builds; and the tracks he leaves in the mud are startlingly  like those fossilized footprints of giant birds that one finds in the  rocks of the Pliocene era, deep under the earth's surface, to tell what  sort of creatures lived in the vast solitudes before man came to  replenish the earth and subdue it.    Closely associated with this suggestion of antiquity in Quoskh's  demeanor is the opposite suggestion of perpetual youth which he carries  with him. Age has no apparent effect on him whatsoever. He is as old and  young as the earth itself is; he is a March day, with winter and spring  in its sunset and sunrise. Who ever saw a blue heron with his jewel eye  dimmed or his natural force abated? Who ever caught one sleeping, or saw  him tottering weakly on his long legs, as one so often sees our common  wild birds clinging feebly to a branch with their last grip? A Cape Cod  sailor once told me that, far out from land, his schooner had passed a  blue heron lying dead on the sea with outstretched wings. That is the  only heron that I have ever heard of who was found without all his wits  about him. Possibly, if Quoskh ever dies, it may suggest a solution to  the question of what becomes of him. With his last strength he may fly  boldly out to explore that great ocean mystery, along the borders of  which his ancestors for untold centuries lived and moved, back and  forth, back and forth, on their endless, unnecessary migrations,  restless, unsatisfied, wandering, as if the voice of the sea were  calling them whither they dared not follow.           *       *       *       *       *    Just behind my tent on the big lake, one summer, a faint, woodsy little  trail wandered away into the woods, with endless turnings and twistings,  and without the faintest indication anywhere, till you reached the very  end, whither it intended going. This little trail was always full of  interesting surprises. Red squirrels peeked down at you over the edge of  a limb, chattering volubly and getting into endless mischief along its  borders. Moose birds flitted silently over it on their mysterious  errands. Now a jumping, smashing, crackling rush through the underbrush  halts you suddenly, with quick beating heart, as you climb over one of  the many windfalls across your path. A white flag followed by another  little one, flashing, rising, sinking and rising again over the fallen  timber, tells you that a doe and her fawn were lying behind the  windfall, all unconscious of your quiet approach. Again, at a turn of  the trail, something dark, gray, massive looms before you, blocking the  faint path; and as you stop short and shrink behind the nearest tree, a  huge head and antlers swing toward you, with widespread nostrils and  keen, dilating eyes, and ears like two trumpets pointing straight at  your head--a bull moose, _sh!_    For a long two minutes he stands there motionless, watching the new  creature that he has never seen before; and it will be well for you to  keep perfectly quiet and let him surrender the path when he is so  disposed. Motion on your part may bring him nearer to investigate; and  you can never know at what slight provocation the red danger light will  blaze into his eyes. At last he moves away, quietly at first, turning  often to look and to make trumpets of his ears at you. Then he lays his  great antlers back on his shoulders, sticks his nose far up ahead of  him, and with long, smooth strides lunges away over the windfalls and is  gone.    So every day the little trail had some new surprise for you,--owl, or  hare, or prickly porcupine rattling his quills, like a quiver of arrows,  and proclaiming his Indian name, _Unk-wunk! Unk-wunk!_ as he loafed  along. When you had followed far, and were sure that the loitering trail  had certainly lost itself, it crept at last under a dark hemlock; and  there, through an oval frame of rustling, whispering green, was the  loneliest, loveliest little deer-haunted beaver pond in the world, where  Quoskh lived with his mate and his little ones.    The first time I came down the trail and peeked through the oval frame  of bushes, I saw him; and the very first glimpse made me jump at the  thought of what a wonderful discovery I had made, namely, that little  herons play with dolls, as children do. But I was mistaken. Quoskh had  been catching frogs and hiding them, one by one, as I came along. He  heard me before I knew he was there, and jumped for his last frog, a big  fat one, with which he slanted up heavily on broad vans--with a hump on  his back and a crook in his neck and his long legs trailing below and  behind--towards his nest in the hemlock, beyond the beaver pond. When I  saw him plainly he was just crossing the oval frame through which I  looked. He had gripped the frog across the middle in his long beak, much  as one would hold it with a pair of blunt shears, swelling it out at  either side, like a string tied tight about a pillow. The head and short  arms were forced up at one side, the limp legs dangled down on the  other, looking for all the world like a stuffed rag doll that Quoskh was  carrying home for his babies to play with.    Undoubtedly they liked the frog much better; but my curious thought  about them, in that brief romantic instant, gave me an interest in the  little fellows which was not satisfied till I climbed to the nest, long  afterwards, and saw them, and how they lived.    When I took to studying Quoskh, so as to know him more intimately, I  found a fascinating subject; not simply because of his queer ways, but  also because of his extreme wariness and the difficulties I met in  catching him doing things. Quoskh K'sobeqh was the name that"]]]
