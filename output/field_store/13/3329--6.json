And the sly fox said, \"Where are you going,  sweet lark?\"    And the lark answered, \"I am going to the king, to sing him a song this  fine May morning.\"    And the sly fox said, \"Come, little lark, and I'll let you see a pretty  white spot on the tip of my tail.\"    But the lark said, \"No, no, sly fox; no, no!  You worried the little  lamb, but you shall not worry me.\"    Then the merry lark flew away till he came to the garden of the king;  and there he sat among the red clover blossoms and sang his sweetest  song.    And the king said to the queen, \"What shall we do for this little lark  who has sung so sweet a song to us?\"    And the queen said to the king, \"I think we must have some May-day  games for the little lark, and invite robin redbreast to sing with him.\"    So the gay robin redbreast came and sang with the lark.    And the king and the queen and all the fine lords and ladies danced and  made merry while the little birds sang.    And after that the lark flew away home to his own green meadow, where  the old gray pussy-cat still lived among the tall reeds.        [1] Permission of American Book Company.          SAVED BY A LARK[1]    Little Helen was four years old.  She lived in the country in a white  house with green window blinds.  The house stood in a large yard, and  had pretty flowers in front of it and a row of big maple-trees on each  side.    Behind the house was an orchard, where the birds liked to build their  nests and sing their sweet songs.  Helen had a swing between two large  apple-trees which stood a little way from the back door.  She could  swing ever so high, and could almost touch the green apples on one of  the branches.    Back of the orchard and garden stood three big red barns.  These barns  were full of wonders for Helen.  She was always glad to go into them  with her father, and see the piles of corn and wheat, the plows and  wagons, and the many other things that were there.    One morning in the harvest-time Helen was standing alone upon the  door-step.  The sun shone bright; the robins were singing in the  apple-trees; the grasshoppers were chirping in the lane; but Helen  heard only the sound of the far-off reaper, as it came to her through  the soft morning air.  She knew that her father was with the reaper.    Don't you know what a reaper is?  It is that with which the farmer cuts  his grain when it is ripe.  It is drawn by horses, and it cuts down the  grain stalks with many sharp knives, which move back and forth very  fast.    \"I think I will go out to the field and help father,\" said Helen to  herself.    In another moment the little feet were turned toward the harvest field.    Across the orchard and down the lane she went, carrying her sunbonnet  in her hand and talking to the grasshoppers, which would somehow get in  her way.    But when at last she came to the field, she saw the men and the reaper  far away toward the other side.    Helen kept on across the field, for she thought that she would soon  catch up with the men.  But it did not take long for the little feet to  grow very tired.    Then she sat down on a sheaf of wheat and looked around her, wishing  that her father would come.    Just in front of her the tall yellow grain was still standing.  Helen  wondered why her father had not cut it down.    As she was looking, a lark flew out from among the grain singing a  rich, clear song.  The little child clapped her hands for joy.  Then  she jumped from her seat and ran toward the place from which the bird  had flown.    \"There is a nest in there, and I am going to find it,\" said Helen to  herself.  She parted the tall yellow wheat-stalks to right and left,  and went forward, looking all about her with her bright, sharp eyes.  She did not have to go very far, for right before her was the nest,  sure enough, and in it were three little birds.    Was there ever anything so cunning as those little heads, with their  tiny bills wide open!  It was such a pretty place for a nest, too.  Helen clapped her hands again, she was so happy.    Then she sat down by the nest, but she did not touch the birdies.  It  was like being in a golden forest, for the grain was high above her  head.    Soon her eyes began to feel heavy, for she was very tired after her  long walk.  She sat down, with her head upon her arm, and in a short  time was fast asleep.    On came the horses, drawing the great reaper with its sharp cutting  knives.  Helen's father was driving, and they were coming right toward  the spot where the little child was lying!    Oh, Helen, little does your father think that you are hidden there in  the tall grain!    What was it that made the farmer check his horses all at once?  Did  something tell him that his dear baby was in danger?    Oh, no! he thought that she was safe at home with her mother.  But he  was a good man with a kind heart, and he saw something that made him  stop.    The lark was flying wildly about over the grain that was in front of  the reaper.  She seemed to say, \"Stop! stop!\"  The farmer thought that  he knew what she meant, and he was too kind-hearted to harm a bird's  nest.  So he said to one of the men, \"Here, Tom, come and hold the  horses.  There must be a nest somewhere among this grain.  I will walk  in and look for it.\"    What a cry the men heard when he found little Helen fast asleep by the  lark's nest!  How his heart almost stood still when he thought of the  danger that she had been in!  He caught her up in his arms and covered  her face with kisses.  \"Oh, my darling!\" he said, \"it was the lark that  saved you!\"    Yes, it was the lark, and his own kind heart, that had saved her.  Helen was carried home in her father's strong arms.  She could not  understand what made the tears run down his cheeks.    It was some time before the men could go on with their work.  They left  the grain standing around the lark's nest, to thank her, as they said,  for saving little Helen.    As they stood looking at the little birds in the nest, one of the men,  with big tears in his eyes, said, \"God bless the birds!  Come away,  boys, and let the little mother feed her babies.\"        [1] Permission of American Book Company.          ALL ABOUT THE MEADOW LARK    SUGGESTIONS FOR FIELD LESSONS    Usually resident--sometimes goes south in late October, returning in  April.    Song--a very beautiful sweet, clear whistle--heard in the early spring  and in the autumn--usually quite silent during brooding season.    Female much paler in colour than male.  General colour brown streaked  with brown and black and cream--breast and throat yellow--conspicuous  black crescent on breast--brown streak on head appearing to run through  the eyes--tail feathers edged with white, which is seen most plainly  when bird is in flight.    Food--seeds, insects, larval insects, also swallows gravel to aid in  digestion.    Nest made of grasses--built on the ground amid tall grass or  grain--usually quite skilfully hidden and arched or roofed over in a  very ingenious way.    Eggs--four in number--about an inch and an eighth in length, a pure  white, speckled with brown.    Greatest danger from snakes and field-mice.    Meadow lark is not really a lark, but belongs to the blackbird family.          THE OWL    [Illustration: The Owl]    A GOOD-NIGHT    \"Haw-haw!  Hoo! hoo!\"    Phyllis listened again.    \"Haw-haw!  Hoo! hoo!  Hoo!  Hoo!\"    \"Oh, I see you now!\" laughed Phyllis.    The owl moved silently as a shadow and perched very near to the little  girl.  His great round eyes and his yellow bill gleamed in the  starlight.    \"I heard you calling!\" said Phyllis.  \"But I could not at first tell  just where you were.  I looked in a dozen trees before I came to you.\"    \"To-who?  To-who-whoo-oo-oo?\" questioned the owl.    Phyllis laughed again.  The owl blinked wisely.    \"I am going home to-morrow,\" Phyllis said.  \"I shall start to school  next week.  Some day, perhaps, I shall be as wise as you, Mr. Owl.\"    The owl only blinked his great eyes.    [Illustration: \"The owl only blinked his great eyes\"]    \"But I'm sure I can never look so wise,\" she added, politely.    \"Hoo-hoo-hoo-oo!\" hooted the owl, blinking sleepily.    \"If you will not talk with me I shall say good-night to you at once!\"  said Phyllis.    \"To-who?  To-who-ooo-oo-oo?\"    \"To-you!  To-you-oo-oo-oo!\" called Phyllis, running off laughing.    \"Papa,\" she said, a few moments later.  \"Papa, the hoot-owl would not  talk with me!\"    \"Wise, wise owl!\" said papa, smiling at her over his newspaper.

THE OWL GIRL    Once a very queer little girl lived in a village beside the great Yukon  River.    This little girl did not care to play with other children.  Indeed, all  day long she would sit inside the stone hut and sleep.    But as soon as evening came the little girl would awaken.  She would  run out to the river-bank to play.  She would shout and laugh.    She did not mind the dark.  In fact she declared that the sun hurt her  eyes and that she could see far better in the dark.    The child's mother said that for all her queerness the little girl was  very wise.  She knew many things which grown-up people had never heard.    The people of the village shook their heads.  They said there was magic  in it all, and that some day something strange would surely happen.    So, when at sunset the queer little girl ran shouting to the river, the  people of the village watched from the bushes.    And sure enough,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20552"],[0,"Roumanian Fairy Tales (#11)"],[1,"nights had passed, he smoothed his  hair and for the third time tapped on the window.    \"What is it? Who is it? What is wanted?\" asked the princess, this time  somewhat more sternly than before.    \"It is I, little sister,\" said the prince. \"For thrice three days I  have stood longingly under your window. I would like to see your face,  gaze into your eyes, and watch the words flow from your lips!\"    The princess opened the window, glanced angrily at the handsome youth,  and said in a scarcely audible voice:    \"I would willingly look into your face and say a word or two to you,  but first go to my younger sister--then come to me.\"    \"I'll send my younger brother,\" replied the prince. \"But give me one  kiss to make my way home pleasanter.\"    And almost before he had spoken, he snatched a kiss from the beautiful  girl.    \"May no second one fall to your lot,\" said the princess, wiping her  mouth with her embroidered sleeve. \"Go back home by the way you came;  may flowers spring up before you and flowers remain behind.\"    The prince went back to his brothers and told them all that had  happened, and the second took his departure.    After this prince had stood under the second princess's window nine  times nine days and nine times nine nights and tapped for the ninth  time at her window, she opened it and said to him kindly:    \"I would like to look at you and say a word or two to you, but first  go to my youngest sister, then come to me.\"    \"I'll send my youngest brother,\" said the prince. \"But give me one  kiss, that I may hurry the faster.\"    He had scarcely said it, when he stole a kiss.    \"May no second one fall to your lot,\" said this royal maiden too. \"Go  back home by the way you came, may flowers spring up before you and  flowers remain behind!\"    The prince returned to his brothers, told them all that had happened,  and--for the third time--a hero departed, the youngest son. When he  reached the palace where the three sisters lived Ileane was standing  at the window, and when she saw him, said merrily:    \"You handsome champion with the royal face, where are you hurrying,  that you urge on your steed so hotly?\"    When the prince saw Ileane's face and heard Ileane's words, he  stopped, gazed at her, and answered boldly:    \"I'm hurrying to the sun to steal one of its rays, to give to its  sister and take her home, where she shall become my bride. Now, little  sister, I will stop on my way to look at you, gaze at the radiance of  your face, say a word to you and steal a word in reply.\"    Ileane cleverly answered: \"If your nature is like your words, if your  soul is like your face, proud and beautiful, and mild and gentle, I  will gladly call you into the house, seat you at a banquet, give you  food and drink and kisses.\"    The prince sprang from his horse as he heard these words, and answered  boldly:    \"My nature will be like my speech, my heart like my face; let me in,  seat me at the banquet, you shall never repent it from dawn till  nightfall.\"    He had scarcely uttered the words when he leaped upon the window-sill,  jumped through the window into the room, went through the room to the  table, and took his place at the very top, where the emperor had sat  when he was a bridegroom.    \"Stop, stop!\" said Ileane. \"First let me see whether you are what you  ought to be, and then we'll talk and begin our love-making. Can you  make roses grow on burdocks?\"    \"No!\" said the prince.    \"Then the thistle is your flower,\" said clever Ileane. \"Can you make  the bat sing in a sweet voice?\"    \"No!\" said the prince.    \"Then night is your day,\" said clever Ileane. \"Can you make apples  grow on wolf's-bane?\"    \"That I can!\" said the prince.    \"Then that shall be your fruit!\" replied the beautiful and cunning  Ileane. \"Sit down at the table.\"    The prince took his place. Ah! but Ileane was indeed cunning Ileane.  Ere he had fairly seated himself, he dropped, chair and all, into the  deep cellar where the emperor's treasures were kept.    Ileane now began to scream: \"Help!\" and when all the servants came  rushing in to see what had happened, she told them she had heard a  noise and was afraid that some one had got into the cellar to rob the  emperor of his treasures. The servants did not waste many words, but  instantly opened the iron door and went into the cellar, where they  found the prince and brought him in disgrace to be sentenced.    Ileane pronounced judgment.    Twelve girls under punishment for some offense were to carry him out  of the country, and when they had reached the frontier with him, each  one was to give him a kiss.    The order was obeyed. When the prince reached home and joined his  brothers, he told them the whole story, and after every thing had been  related their hearts were filled with rage. So they sent word to the  two older princesses that they must arrange to have Ileane go to the  three princes' court, so that they might revenge themselves upon her  for the insult she had offered them. When the oldest daughter received  this message from the prince she pretended to be sick, called Ileane  to her bedside, and told her that she could not get well unless Ileane  brought her something to eat from the princes' kitchen.    Ileane would have done any thing for her sister's sake, so she took a  little jug and set off for the court of the three princes, to beg or  steal. When she reached the palace, she rushed breathlessly into the  kitchen and said to the head-cook:    \"For heaven's sake, don't you hear the emperor calling you? Make  haste, and see what is the matter.\"    The cook took to his heels and ran as fast as he could, as though he  had received an imperial command. Ileane, left alone in the kitchen,  filled her jug with food, emptied all the dainty dishes that were on  the fire upon the floor, and went away.    When the princes heard of this insult they were still more enraged  than before, sent another message to the two sisters and again  prepared a revenge. As soon as the second sister received the news,  she, too, pretended to be ill, called Ileane to her bed, and told her  that she could not get well unless she tasted the wine in the princes'  cellar. Ileane would have done any thing for her sister, so she took  the little jug and prepared to go again.    When she reached the court she rushed into the cellar, and, panting  for breath, said to the head-butler:    \"For heaven's sake, don't you hear the emperor calling you? Make haste  and see what is the matter.\" The butler took to his heels and ran as  if he had received an imperial command. Ileane filled her jug with  wine, poured out the rest on the cellar floor, and then hurried home.    The princes sent a third message to the two princesses and told them  they must send Ileane in a different way from what they had done  before. This time both the princesses feigned illness, called their  sister to them, and told her that they could not get well unless  Ileane brought them two of the princes' apples.    \"My dear sisters,\" replied Ileane, \"I would go through fire and water  for you, how much more willingly to the princes.\" Taking the little  jug she set off to find, seize, and bring back the fruit and save her  dear sisters' lives.    When the youngest prince learned that Ileane was coming to the garden  to steal the golden apples, he gave orders that, if groans were heard  there, nobody must dare go in, but let the person who was wailing,  moan in peace. Then he hid huge knives, swords, spears, and many other  things in the earth under the tree that bore the golden apples,  concealing them so that only the sharp points rose out of the ground.  After he had finished, he hid himself in a clump of bushes and waited  for Ileane. She came to the gate, and seeing the two huge lions that  kept guard there flung each of them a piece of meat; the lions began  to tear it, and the princess went to the apple tree, stepped  cautiously between the knives, swords, spears, and other things, and  climbed into it.    \"May this do you much good, little sister,\" said the prince. \"I'm glad  to see you in my garden.\"    \"The pleasure is mine,\" replied Ileane, \"since I have so brave and  handsome a prince for my companion. Come, climb the tree and help me  pick some apples for my dear sisters, who are dangerously ill and have  asked for them.\"    The prince wanted nothing better--he meant to pull Ileane from the  tree among the knives.    \"You are very kind, Ileane,\" he replied, \"be kinder still and give me  your hand to help me up into the tree.\"    \"Your plan is wicked,\" thought Ileane, \"but it shall work your own  misfortune.\" She gave him her hand, pulled him up the trunk to the  branches, and then let him drop among the knives, swords, spears and  other such things, which had been put there for her own destruction.    \"There you are,\" she said, \"now you will know what you meant to do.\"    The hero with the black soul began to shriek and groan--but nobody  came to help him; they left him, according to his own orders, to moan  in peace, and he was obliged to bear his terrible sufferings  patiently.    Ileane took her apples, carried them home, gave them to her sisters,  and then went back to the imperial palace and told the servants to go  and rescue their master from his great danger.    The prince, who had been so abominably treated, sent for the most  skillful witch in the whole country to come and give him a cure for  his wounds. But Ileane had gone to the witch first and offered her a  great deal of money to let her, Ileane, go to the court in her place.  So Ileane went to the palace disguised as the witch. She ordered a  buffalo hide to be soaked in vinegar three days and three nights, then  taken out and wrapped around the wounded youth. But the prince's cuts  only burned the more, and his sufferings became still more unbearable.  When he saw that he was in a bad way, he sent for a priest that he  might relieve"]]]
