How often have we been told  this! Yet how false the reasoning is! Very carefully prepared statistics  show that between the ages of twenty and forty-five years, more  unmarried women die than married, and few instances of remarkable  longevity in an old maid are known. The celebrated Dr. Hufeland,  therefore, in his treatise on the _Art_ _of Prolonging Life_, lays it  down as a rule, that to attain a great age, one must be married.    As for happiness, those who think they can best attain it outside the  gentle yoke of matrimony are quite as wide of the mark. Their selfish  and solitary pleasures do not gratify them. With all the resources of  clubs, billiard-rooms, saloons, narcotics, and stimulants, single men  make but a mock show of satisfaction. At heart every one of them envies  his married friends. How much more monotonous and more readily exhausted  are the resources of woman's single life! No matter what 'sphere' she is  in, no matter in what 'circle' she moves, no matter what 'mission' she  invents, it will soon pall on her. Would you see the result? We invoke  once more those dry volumes, full of lines and figures, on vital  statistics. Stupid as they look, they are full of the strangest stories;  and what is more, the stories are all true. Some of them are sad  stories, and this is one of the saddest: Of those unfortunates who, out  of despair and disgust of the world, jump from bridges, or take arsenic,  or hang themselves, or in other ways rush unbidden and unprepared before  the great Judge of all, _nearly two-thirds_ are unmarried, and in some  years nearly _three-fourths_. And of those other sad cases--dead, yet  living--who people the madhouses and asylums, what of them? Driven crazy  by their brutal husbands, do you suggest? Not at all! In France,  Bavaria, Prussia, Hanover, four out of every five are unmarried; and  throughout the civilised world there are everywhere three or four single  to one married woman in the establishments for the insane, in  proportion to the whole number of the two classes above twenty-one years  of age.    Other women decline to marry because they have, forsooth, a 'life work'  to accomplish. Some great project fills their mind. Perchance they  emulate Madame de Stael, and would electrify the country by their novel  views in politics; or they have a literary vein they fain would exploit;  or they feel called upon to teach the freedmen, or to keep their  position as leaders of fashion. A husband would trammel them. If they  did marry, they would take the very foolish advice of a contemporary,  and go through life with an indignant protest at its littleness. Let  such women know that they underrate the married state, its powers and  its opportunities. There are no loftier missions than can there be  carried out, no nobler games than can there be played. When we think of  these objections, coming, as they have to us, from high-spirited,  earnest girls, the queens of their sex, our memory runs back to the  famous women of history, the brightest jewels in the coronet of time,  and we find as many, ay, more, married women than single who pursued to  their ends mighty achievements.    If you speak of Judith and Joan of Arc, who delivered their fatherlands  from the enemy by a daring no man can equal, we shall recall the  peaceful victories of her, wife of the barbarian Chlodwig, who taught  the rude Franks the mild religion of Nazareth, and of her who extended  from Byzantium the holy symbol of the cross over the wilds of Russia.  The really great women of this age, are they mostly married or single?  They are mostly married, and they are good wives and tender mothers.    What we have just written, we read to an amiable woman.    'But,' she exclaimed, 'what have you to say to her whom high duties or a  hard fate condemns to a single life, and to the name of the old maid?'    Alas! what can we say to such? We feel that        'Earthlier happy is the rose distilled,      Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,      Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.'    Yet there is ever a blessing in store for those who suffer here, and the  hope of the future must teach them to bear the present.      LOVE IS ETERNAL.    We have said love is a necessity in the life of either man or woman to  complete their nature. Its effects, therefore, are eternal. We do not  intend this as a figure of speech. It is a sober statement of  physiology.    From the day of marriage the woman undergoes a change in her whole  structure. She is similar to her former self, but not the same. It is  often noticed that the children of a woman in her second marriage bear a  marked resemblance to her first husband. In the inferior races and lower  animals this obscure metamorphosis is still more apparent. A negress who  has borne her first child to a white man, will ever after have children  of a color lighter than her own. Count Strzelewski, in his Travels in  Australia, narrates this curious circumstance: A native woman who has  once had offspring by a white man, can never more have children by a  male of her own race. Dr. Darwin relates that a male zebra was once  brought to England, and a hybrid race, marked by the zebra's stripes,  was produced from certain mares. Always after, the colts of those mares  bore the marks of the zebra on their skins. In some way the female is  profoundly altered throughout her whole formation, and entirely  independent of her will, by the act of marriage, and the alteration is  never effaced.    If the body is thus influenced, shall not the far more susceptible mind  and spirit be equally impressed?    Another common observation supports what we say, and extends it farther.  Not the woman alone,--the man also undergoes a change, and loses a  portion of his personality in his mate. They two are one, not merely in  a moral sense. We constantly notice a decided resemblance in old couples  who have passed, say, two score years together. They have grown to look  alike in form, feature, and expression. That for so long a time they  have breathed the same air, eaten the same fare, and been subjected to  the same surroundings, explains this to some extent. But the greater  part of the change flows from mental sources. They have laughed and wept  together; they have shared the same joys and pleasures; a smile or a  tear on the face of one has evoked a corresponding emotion and  expression on the face of the other. Their co-partnership has become a  unity. Even without speaking, they sympathize. Their souls are  constantly _en rapport_. The man is as different as the woman from his  former self.      OF SECOND MARRIAGES.    Science, therefore, seems to say to woman, 'Your first husband is your  eternal husband.' How, then, about second marriages? Are we to say that  they are not advisable?    Let us not answer hastily. It is yet to be seen whether ill-assorted  marriages produce those impressions we have mentioned. They may, indeed,  on the body, while the mind is free. One must remember, also, that the  exigencies of social life must be consulted. If a woman cannot love two  men equally,--and she cannot,--other motives, worthy of all respect,  justify her in entering the marriage life a second time. Then, the  higher refinements of the emotions are not given to all alike, nor do  they come at the same age to all. True love may first dawn upon a woman  after one or two husbands have left her a widow. Orphan children,  widow-hood, want of property, or the care of property,--these are sad  afflictions to the lonely woman. Do not blame her if she accepts a  husband as a guardian, a protector, whom she can no longer receive to  her arms as a lover. She is right.    We cherish the memory of a lady of strong character, who died past  eighty. She had survived three husbands. 'The first,' she said, 'I  married for love, the second for position, the third for friendship. I  was happy with them all.' But when, in her mortal illness, this  venerable friend sank into the delirium which preceded death, she  constantly called out the name of her first husband only. More than  half a century had not effaced the memory of those few years of early  love. This is fidelity indeed.      OF DIVORCE.    He of Nazareth laid down the law that whoever puts away his wife for any  cause except adultery, and marries again, commits adultery; and that  whatever woman puts away her husband for any cause save adultery, and  marries again, herself commits adultery.    This has been found a hard saying.    John Milton wrote a book to show that the Lawgiver did not mean what He  said, but something quite different. Modern sects, calling themselves  _Christians_, after this Lawgiver, dodge the difficulty, and refer it to  State legislatures. State legislatures, not troubling themselves at all  about any previous law or lawgiver, allow dozens of causes--scores of  them--as perfectly valid to put asunder those whom God has joined  together.    Science, which never finds occasion to disagree with that Lawgiver of  Nazareth, here makes His words her own.    Whether we look at it as a question in social life, in morals, or in  physiology, the American plan of granting absolute divorces is  dangerous, and destructive to what is best in life. It leads to hasty,  ill-assorted matches, to an unwillingness to yield to each other's  peculiarities, to a weakening of the family ties, to a lax morality.  Carry it a trifle farther than it now is in some of the Western States,  and marriage will lose all its sacredness, and degenerate into a  physical union, not nobler than the crossing of flies in the air.    Separation of bed and board should always be provided for by law; and  whether single, married, or separated, the woman should retain entire  control of her own property.

There always lingers about the genius of these two delicate  and sensitive beings a certain perfume of the white lilac which Maurice  loved. It happened that through the amiability of my father, when I read  the Journals of the De Gu['e]rins, I had leisure. A period of ill health  stopped my work--I had begun to study law--and there were long days that  could easily be filled by strolls in Fairmount Park in the early spring  days, when it seems most appropriate to associate one's self with these  two who ought to be read in the mood of the early spring, and they ought  to be read slowly and even prayerfully. I hope I may be pardoned for  quoting a sonnet which had a great vogue in the late 'seventies showing  the impression that Maurice de Gu['e]rin made. It was a great surprise to  find part of the sestette copied in the \"Prose Writings\" of Walt  Whitman, who very rarely quoted any verse.        The old wine filled him, and he saw, with eyes      Anoint of Nature, fauns and dryads fair      Unseen by others; to him maidenhair      And waxen lilacs, and those birds that rise      A-sudden from tall reeds at slight surprise,      Brought charm[`e]d thoughts; and in earth everywhere      He, like sad Jacques, found a music rare      As that of Syrinx to old Grecians wise.      A pagan heart, a Christian soul had he:      He followed Christ, yet for dead Pan he sighed,      Till earth and heaven met within his breast;      As if Theocritus in Sicily      Had come upon the Figure crucified      And lost his gods in deep, Christ given rest.    I found, too, satisfaction of the taste which Hamerton had corroborated,  in Eug['e]nie de Gu['e]rin's little sketches of outdoor scenery--sketches  which always have a human interest. I had not yet begun to take any  pleasure in Wordsworth; and, in fact, all the poets who seemed to be  able to enjoy nature for itself--nature unrelieved or unimproved by  human figures--had no attractions for me. And here the dear Edward Roth  came in, and confirmed my taste. And there were heavy arguments with  other clever Philadelphians, Doctor Nolan, the scientist who loved  letters, and that amateur of literature, Charles Devenny.    As for Pope and his school, they seemed to represent an aspect of the  world as unreal as the world of Watteau, and with much less excuse; but  pictures of the kind I found in the \"Journal\" of Eug['e]nie de Gu['e]rin  had a living charm. At this time, I had not seen Matthew Arnold's paper  on Maurice de Gu['e]rin, and I did not know that any appreciation of his  sister had been written in English. I had seen a paragraph or two  written by some third-rate person who objected to her piety as  sentimental, and incomprehensible to the \"Anglo-Saxon\" world! That her  piety should be sentimental, if Eug['e]nie's sentiment can be  characterized by that term, seemed to me to be questionable; and it was  evident that any one who read French literature at all must be aware  that there were hundreds of beautiful sentiments and phrases which the  average \"Anglo-Saxon\" world found it impossible to comprehend.    The beloved home of Eug['e]nie, La Cayla, was not a gay place. It was even  more circumscribed than Miss Mitford's \"Village\"; but Eug['e]nie, being  less \"Anglo-Saxon\" than Miss Mitford, had more sentiment and a more  sensitive perception of the meaning of nature--though, when it comes to  sentimentalism, the English man or woman, who often masquerades under  the shelter of \"Anglo-Saxonism,\" is as sentimental as the most  sentimental of sentimentalists. This is what I mean by the landscape  charm of Eug['e]nie de Gu['e]rin, and yet the picture in this case is not a  landscape, but the interior of a room:         I was admiring just now a little landscape, presented by my room,       as it was being illuminated with the rising sun. How pretty it was!       Never did I see a more beautiful effect of light on the paper,       thrown through painted trees. It was diaphanous, transparent. It       was almost wasted on my eyes; it ought to have been seen by a       painter. And yet does not God create the beautiful for everybody?       All our birds were singing this morning while I was at my prayers.       This accompaniment pleases me, though it distracts me a little. I       stop to listen; then I begin again, thinking that the birds and I       are alike singing a hymn to God, and that, perhaps, those little       creatures sing better than I. But the charm of prayer, the charm of       communion with God, they cannot enjoy that; one must have a soul to       feel it. This happiness that the birds have not is mine. It is       sorrow. How little time is needed for that. The joy comes from the       sun, the mild air, the song of birds, all delights to me; as well       as from a letter of Mimi's (who is now at Gaillac), in which she       tells me of Madame Vialar, who has seen thee, and of other cheerful       things.    And again:         However, I had a delightful waking this morning. As I was opening       my eyes a lovely moon faced my window, and shone into my bed, so       brightly that at first I thought it was a lamp suspended to my       shutter. It was very sweet and pretty to look at this white light,       and so I contemplated, admired, watched it till it hid itself       behind the shutter to peep out again, and then conceal itself like       a child playing at hide-and-seek.    Emerson tried to teach us that there can be infinite beauties in a  little space--untold joys within a day--and he asks us to take short  outlooks. Saint Teresa and Saint Francis de Sales were before him in  this; but Eug['e]nie de Gu['e]rin exemplifies its value much more than any  other modern writer. Her soul was often sad, but it never ceased to find  joy in the little happinesses of life. In our country, we are losing  this faculty which the best of the later New Englanders tried to  recover. It is a pity because it deprives us of the real _joie de vivre_  which is not dependent on ecstasies of restless emotions or violent  amusements.    The devotion of Eug['e]nie de Gu['e]rin to her brother resembles that of  Madame de S['e]vign['e] for her daughter, the peerless Pauline. It was  George Sand who discovered the genius of that brother, though her  characterization of the qualities of his genius did not please the  Christian soul of his sister. It was left to Sainte-Beuve to fix De  Gu['e]rin's place in French literature; and I recall now that the  reading of Sainte-Beuve led me to find the poems of David Gray, now  probably forgotten, and to go back to Keats.    After Maurice de Gu['e]rin's \"Le Centaure\" I found Keats even less Greek  than I thought he was, because he was less philosophical than De Gu['e]rin,  and because he did not concern himself with the gravest questions of  life; but, after all, Keats is the poet for the poets!    My dear friend, Edward Roth--whom James Huneker celebrates in his  \"Steeplejack\"--named Spenser as \"the poet of the poets\"; but Spenser is  too hard to read--even harder than Chaucer, and certainly more involved,  while no poets that ever lived can make pictures so glowing, so full of  a sensitive and exquisite light as Keats. Later, it seemed absurd for  the French poets of a certain _genre_ to call themselves symbolists.  When Keats wrote, he saw and felt, and he saw because he felt. It was  not necessary for him to search laboriously for the colour of a word.  The thing itself coloured the word--and Keats, working hard in a verbal  laboratory, would have been an anomaly. It was not necessary for him to  study carefully the music of his verse as Campion did or Coventry  Patmore or as Sidney Lanier is supposed to have done--though one cannot  have suspected that Sidney Lanier's elaborate laboratory was erected  after his best verse had been written.    Maurice de Gu['e]rin, a very Christian soul, was probably disturbed in  his religious sentiments by the defection of his old friend and  director, P[`e]re de Lamennais--the \"M. F['e]li\" of the little paradise  of la Ch['e]nie. To the delight of some of the more independent and  emancipated of the literary circle at Paris, which included George Sand,  Maurice was becoming more pantheistic than Christian. He seemed to have  tried to make for humanity an altar on which Christ and Nature might be  almost equally adored, and this gave Eug['e]nie great pain, although it  did not change her love or make a rift in her belief in him.    De Gu['e]rin is a singing poet in a language which is used by few singing  poets for serious themes. There are few lyric poems in French, like the  \"Chanson de Fortunio\" of Alfred de Musset. It was not strange that the  great Sainte-Beuve found the verse of De Gu['e]rin somewhat too unusual.  Sainte-Beuve calls it \"the familiar Alexandrine reduced to a  conversational tone, and taking all the little turns of an intimate  talk.\" Eug['e]nie complains that \"it sings too much and does not talk  enough.\" However, one of the most charming of literary essays, to which  Matthew Arnold's seems almost \"common,\" is that preceding Tr['e]butien's  \"Journals, Letters, and Poems of Maurice de Gu['e]rin.\" It would be folly  for me to try to permeate the mind of any other person with the  atmosphere which still palpitates in me when I think of the first  delight of reading at leisure the poems of Maurice and the letters of  Eug['e]nie. I might just as well attempt to make a young man of our time  feel the thrill that came when we were young and first heard the most  beautiful of all love songs--\"Come into the Garden, Maud!\"    One can hear the amazed laughter, the superior giggles that would arise  from a group of Greenwich Villagers if they did me the honour to read  this page; but the real Quartier Latin has better taste and is not so  imitative--and paraphrases of this lovely lyric still find admirers in  the gardens of the Luxembourg and on the heights of Montmartre."]]]
