He cuts  grasses, ferns, pea-vines and other green plants and carries them  in little bundles to the entrance to his tunnel.  There he piles  them on sticks so as to keep them off he damp ground and so that  the air can help dry them out.  When they are dry, he takes them  inside and stores them away.  He also stores other things.  He likes  the roots of ferns.  He cuts tender, young twigs from bushes and  stores away some of these.  He is fond of bark.  In winter he is  quite as active as in summer and tunnels about under the snow.  Then he sometimes has Peter Rabbit's bad habit of killing trees  by gnawing bark all around as high up as he can reach.\"    \"Can he climb trees?\" asked Chatterer the Red Squirrel.    \"Just about as much as Johnny Chuck can,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"Sometimes he climbs up in low bushes or in small, low-branching  trees to cut off tender shoots, but he doesn't do much of this sort  of thing.  His home is the ground.  He is most active at night, but  where undisturbed, is out more or less during the day.  When he wants  to cut off a twig he sits up like a Squirrel and holds the twig in  his hands while he bites it off with his sharp teeth.\"    \"You didn't tell us what color his coat is,\" said Peter Rabbit.    \"I told you he looked very much like Jerry Muskrat,\" replied Old  Mother Nature.  \"His coat is brown, much the color of Jerry's, but  his fur is not nearly so soft and fine.\"    \"I suppose he has enemies just as the rest of us little people have,\"  said Peter.    \"Of course,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"All little people have  enemies, and most big ones too, for that matter.  King Eagle is one  and Yowler the Bob Cat is another.  They are always watching for  Stubtail.  That is why he digs so many tunnels.  He can travel under  the ground then.  My goodness, how time flies!  Scamper home, all of  you, for I have too much to do to talk any more to-day.\"        CHAPTER X  Prickly Porky and Grubby Gopher    All the way to school the next morning Peter Rabbit wondered who  they would learn about that day.  He was so busy wondering that he  was heedless.  Peter is apt to be heedless at times.  The result  was that as he hopped out of a bramble-tangle just within the edge  of the Green Forest, he all but landed in something worse than the  worst brambles that ever grew.  It was only by a wild side jump  that he saved himself.  Peter had almost landed among the thousand  little spears of Prickly Porky the Porcupine.    \"Gracious!\" exclaimed Peter.    \"Why don't you look where you are going,\" grunted Prickly Porky.  Plainly he was rather peevish.  \"It wouldn't be my fault if you had  a few of my little spears sticking in you this very minute, and it  would serve you right.\"  He waddled along a few steps, then began  talking again.  \"I don't see why Old Mother Nature sent for me this  morning,\" he grumbled.  \"I hate a long walk.\"    Peter pricked up his long ears.  \"I know!\" he cried.  \"You're going  to school, Prickly Porky.  You're a Rodent, and we are going to  learn all about you this morning.\"    \"I'm not a Rodent; I'm a Porcupine,\" grunted Prickly Porky indignantly.    \"You're a Rodent just the same.  You've got big gnawing teeth, and  any one with that kind of teeth is a Rodent,\" retorted Peter.  Then  at a sudden thought a funny look passed over his face.  \"Why, that  means that you and I are related in a way,\" he added.    \"Don't believe it,\" grunted Prickly Porky, still shuffling along.  \"Don't believe it.  Don't want to be related to anybody as  heedless as you.  What is this school, anyway?  Don't want to go to  school.  Know all I want to know.  Know how to get all I want to eat  and how to make everybody get out of my way and leave me alone, and  that's enough to know.\"  He rattled the thousand little spears  hidden in his coat, and Peter shivered at the sound.  It was a most  unpleasant sound.    \"Well, some folks do like to be stupid,\" snapped Peter and hurried  on, lipperty-lipperty-lip, while Prickly Porky slowly shuffled and  rattled along behind.    All the others were there when Peter arrived.  Prickly Porky wasn't  even in sight.  Old Mother Nature wasted no time.  She has too much  to do ever to waste time.  She called the school to order at once.    \"Yesterday,\" she began, \"I told you about two little haymakers of  the high mountains of the Far West.  Who were they, Peter Rabbit?\"    \"Little Chief Hare, called the Pika or Cony, and Stubtail the  Mountain Beaver or Sewellel,\" replied Peter with great promptness.    \"Right,\" said Old Mother Nature. \"Now I am going to tell you of  one of my little plowmen who also lives in the Far West but prefers  the great plains to the high mountains, though he is sometimes  found in the latter.  He is Grubby the Gopher, a member of the  same order the rest of you belong to, but of a family quite his  own.  He is properly called the Pocket Gopher, and way down in  the Southeast, where he is also found, he is called a Salamander,  though what for I haven't the least idea.\"    \"Does he have pockets in his cheeks like mine?\" asked Striped  Chipmunk eagerly.    \"He has pockets in his cheeks, and that is why he is called Pocket  Gopher,\" replied Old Mother Nature; \"but they are not at all like  yours, Striped Chipmunk.  Yours are on the inside of your cheeks,  but his are on the outside.\"    \"How funny!\" exclaimed Striped Chipmunk.    \"Your pockets are small compared with those of Grubby,\" continued  Old Mother Nature.  \"One of his covers almost the whole side of  his head back to his short neck, and it is lined with fur, and  remember he has two of them.  Grubby uses these for carrying food  and never for carrying out earth when he is digging a tunnel, as  some folks think he does.  He stuffs them full with his front feet  and empties them by pressing them from the back with his feet.  The Gopher family is quite large and the members range in size  from the size of Danny Meadow Mouse to that of Robber the Rat,  only these bigger members are stouter and heavier than Robber.  Some are reddish-brown and some are gray.  But whatever his size  and wherever he is found, Grubby's habits are the same.\"    All this time Peter Rabbit had been fidgeting about.  It was quite  clear that Peter had something on his mind.  Now as Old Mother  Nature paused, Peter found the chance he had been waiting for.  \"If you please, why did you call him a plowman?\" he asked eagerly.    \"I'm coming to that all in due time,\" replied Old Mother Nature,  smiling at Peter's eagerness.  \"Grubby Gopher spends most of his  life underground, very much like Miner the Mole, whom you all  know.  He can dig tunnels just about as fast.  His legs are short,  and his front legs and feet are very stout and strong.  They are  armed with very long, strong claws and it is with these and the  help of his big cutting teeth that Grubby digs.  He throws the  earth under him and then kicks it behind him with his hind feet.  When he has quite a pile behind him he turns around, and with his  front feet and head pushes it along to a little side tunnel and  then up to the surface of the ground.  As soon as he has it all  out he plugs up the opening and goes back to digging.  The loose  earth he has pushed out makes little mounds, and he makes one of  these mounds every few feet.    \"Grubby is a great worker.  He is very industrious.  Since he is  underground, it doesn't make much difference to him whether it be  night or day.  In summer, during the hottest part of the day, he  rests.  His eyes are small and weak because he has little use for  them, coming out on the surface very seldom and then usually in  the dusk.  He has a funny little tail without any hair on it; this  is very sensitive and serves him as a sort of guide when he runs  backward along his tunnel, which he can do quite fast.  A funny  thing about those long claws on his front feet is that he folds  them under when he is walking or running.  Do any of you know why  Farmer Brown plows his garden?\"    As she asked this, Old Mother Nature looked from one to another,  and each in turn shook his head.  \"It is to mix the dead vegetable  matter thoroughly with the earth so that the roots of the plants  may get it easily,\" explained Old Mother Nature.  \"By making those  tunnels in every direction and bringing up the earth below to the  surface, Grubby Gopher does the same thing.  That is why I call  him my little plowman.  He loosens up the hard, packed earth and  mixes the vegetable matter with it and so makes it easy for seeds  to sprout and plants to grow.\"    \"Then he must be one of the farmer's best friends,\" spoke up  Happy Jack Squirrel.    Old Mother Nature shook her head.  \"He has been in the past,\" said  she.  \"He has done a wonderful work in helping make the land fit  for farming.  But where land is being farmed he is a dreadful  pest, I am sorry to say.  You see he eats the crops the farmer  tries to raise, and the new mounds he is all the time throwing up  bury a lot of the young plants, and in the meadows make it very  hard to use a mowing machine for cutting hay.  Then Grubby gets  into young orchards and cuts off all the tender roots of young  trees.  This kills them.  You see he is fond of tender roots,  seeds, stems of grass and grain, and is never happier than when  he can find a field of potatoes.    \"Being such a worker, he has to have a great deal to eat.  Then,  too, he stores away a great deal for winter, for he doesn't sleep  in winter as Johnny Chuck does.  He even tunnels about under the  snow.  Sometimes he fills these little snow tunnels with the earth  he brings up from below, and when the snow melts it leaves queer  little earth ridges to show where the tunnels were.    \"Grubb"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24416"],[0,"Life and Work in Benares and Kumaon, 1839-1877 (#11)"],[1," published a handsome volume under the title of _The  Sacred City of the Hindus_, in which he gave ample information about its  history, temples, castes, festivals, commerce, and religious  pre-eminence in Hindu estimation. To that work I must refer readers who  are desirous to be furnished with details. My aim is to describe as  concisely and vividly as I can the marked peculiarities of the place.    Benares is the largest city in the North-Western Provinces, though it is  approached in population by some others, as Delhi, Agra, and Allahabad.  It is among the largest purely native cities in India, but it is greatly  surpassed in population and wealth by Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, the  great seats of British rule, and the great emporia of Indian as well as  of European commerce in the East. These cities under our rule have risen  to be among the greatest in Eastern Asia. For many a day the population  of Benares was said to be above 500,000, but this has turned out a very  exaggerated conjecture.[1] When the first careful census was taken, the  resident population was found to be under 200,000, and every succeeding  census has confirmed its substantial accuracy. In the last census the  number given is 207,570. When the first census was taken great surprise  was expressed at the result, and some asserted no dependence could be  placed on it. The ground of this assertion was that in the houses of  some of the wealthier classes there are many females, who live, in  native phrase, behind the curtain, who are never seen by outsiders, to  whom the officials of the Government have no access; and on this account  the accuracy of the return made to the enumerators entirely depends on  the faithfulness of the head of the household. It has been said that  when the first census was taken the general impression was a capitation  tax was to be imposed, and that in consequence the inmates reported were  far below the actual number. If there was error on this account it was  to a very limited extent, as every subsequent census has agreed with the  first, although the notion of a capitation tax has entirely died out.  One going through Benares, from street to street, from one end of it to  the other, does not get the impression its resident population exceeds  the estimate found in official statements. The city has a great floating  population, as it is the resort of strangers from all parts of India. It  is reckoned that on the occasion of the great festivals there may be  100,000 visitors, some say 200,000, but we are not aware any attempt has  been made to number them.    [Footnote 1: Bishop Heber visited Benares in 1824. He says in his  journal, \"The population, according to a census made in 1803, amounted  to above 582,000--an enormous amount, and which one should think must  have been exaggerated.\" The census which gives such a return must have  been taken in a very singular manner.]    [Sidenote: TRADE AND COMMERCE.]    In commerce, as in population, Benares holds a high, but not the  highest, place among Indian cities. The district of Benares is not so  large as some others in the North-West; but it is very productive, is  densely peopled, and the city has on this account a large local  business. Besides, the merchants and bankers of Benares have dealings  with the other districts of the province, and indeed with all parts of  India. The city has many artificers. It has workers in stone, wood,  iron, brass, silver and gold. They produce articles which command a  large and profitable sale. God-making and toy-making are among the  staple businesses of the place. The making of idols in different  materials to suit the taste and means of purchasers, gives employment to  many. The images while being made are only stone, brass, or gold, as it  may be, and no reverence is then due to them. It is when certain sacred  words are uttered over them, and the god is supposed to take possession  of them, they become objects of worship. Benares is well known for its  toys made of very light wood, and lacquered over. Of late years the  enchased brass vessels made in Benares have been much admired, and have  secured a large and profitable sale. Perhaps the most important  manufacture of the place is _kimkhwab_--_kinkob_ as it is called by  Europeans--cloth made of silver and gold tissue, in which the princes  and grandees of India array themselves on state occasions. I believe  this business has fallen off, as with the incoming of European influence  the love of barbaric pearl and gold has declined, if not among the  rajahs of the land, among a class beneath them, who formerly thought  they could not retain their rank in society if they did not appear on  special occasions in gorgeous robes.    While in population and commerce there are cities in India which surpass  Benares, in Hindu estimation it stands above them all in religious  pre-eminence. Perhaps at the present time more eyes are turned  reverently towards it than to any city on the face of the earth.    [Illustration: A JEWELLER AT WORK.]    I must attempt a brief sketch of the history of Benares. We are sure it  was not among the first cities erected by the Aryans after leaving their  home in Central Asia and crossing the Indus. They first took possession  of the land in the far north-west of the great country they had entered,  and gradually made their way to the south and east. Wonderfully acute  and painstaking though the Pundit mind be, it has so dwelt in the  regions of speculation and imagination that it has paid no attention to  historical research. Its laborious productions have left us ignorant of  recent times, and we need not therefore wonder that, except by  incidental allusions, it throws no light on the early settlements of the  Aryans in India. We know that they brought with them a considerable  measure of civilization, and soon erected cities. Indraprastha, built  near the site of the present city of Delhi, and Hastinapore, some thirty  miles from it, figure largely in the Mahabharut, the giant Hindu epic.  Kunauj, lying east and south of Delhi, became some time afterwards the  capital of a widely extended empire, which lasted, with vicissitudes,  down to Muhammadan times. Benares is seen in the dim light of antiquity  as a favourite abode of Brahmans, and as sacred on that account, but it  does not appear that it ever was the seat of extended rule. For many a  day it was subject to Kunauj, and it afterwards came under the sway of  the Muhammadans, to whom it was subject for six hundred years.    [Sidenote: BUDDHISM.]    A clear proof of the influential position of Benares centuries before  the Christian era, is furnished by the fact that Gautama, the founder of  Buddhism, deemed it well to commence his public ministry there in the  sixth century B.C.[2] The spot where he first unfolded his doctrine  was a grove at a place now called Sarnath, about four miles from the  present city. At this place there is a large Buddhist tower, which is  seen from a great distance, and around it are extensive remains, which  have been excavated under the direction of Major-General Cunningham, and  have been found to be of Buddhist origin. The success which Buddhism had  achieved and maintained for centuries in the country where it arose, is  strikingly confirmed by the testimony of two Chinese Buddhists who went  on pilgrimage to India, the one in the fifth century A.D., and the other  towards the middle of the seventh. Their narratives have been preserved,  and furnish us with most interesting details. From them we learn that  down to the time of their visits Buddhism had temples, monasteries, and  thousands of adherents; but it had not the field to itself, for these  strangers tell us, especially the later of the two, that a large and  increasing number of the people were warmly attached to Hinduism. We  have no historical account of the overthrow of Buddhism, but we have  reason to believe that towards the close of the eleventh century, or  earlier, the devotees of Hinduism rose against it, and so stamped it out  that not a temple was left standing and not a monastery remained.  Major-General Cunningham says that about that period \"the last votaries  of Buddha were expelled from the continent of India. Numbers of images,  concealed by the departing monks, are found buried near Sarnath; and  heaps of ashes still lie scattered amidst the ruins, to show that the  monasteries were destroyed by fire.\" This is confirmed by excavations  made at a later period by Major Kittoe, who says, \"All has been sacked  and burned--priests, temples, idols, all together; for, in some places,  bones, iron, wood and stone, are found in huge masses: and this has  happened more than once.\" From Benares having been the scene of  Gautama's early ministry, and the place where his first disciples were  called, it stands high in the reverence of the millions who compose his  followers, although their only living representatives there now are a  few Jains, whom orthodox Buddhists regard as heretics.    [Footnote 2: The names and titles of this famous teacher are perplexing  to those who do not know the meaning. His father was chief or king of a  tribe called Sakyas, and therefore Gautama received the name of  Sakya-Muni, or Sakya-Saint. When he announced himself as the inspired  teacher of the nations he took the name of Buddha--the wise man, the  enlightener, the inspired prophet.]    [Sidenote: THE SACREDNESS OF KASEE.]    Long before the time of Gautama Hinduism prevailed at Benares, and we  have observed its rites were practised side by side with those of  Buddhism when the city was visited by two Chinese pilgrims. Some time  afterwards it obtained full sway under the form of fanatical devotion to  Shiva the Destroyer, and that sway it has maintained down to our day.  What Jerusalem is to the Jews; what Mecca is to the Muhammadans; what  Rome is to the Roman Catholics--that, and more than that,"]]]
