A large animal like bear or leopard  looks well with the paws preserved and they should be skinned down to  the last joint, leaving the claws attached to the skin. Smaller skins  may have the paws preserved, though the effect is hardly worth the  trouble and the smaller paws are easily crushed on the floor by a chance  step.    After skinning, using care to detach it from the head without mutilating  the ears, eyes and lips, stretch flat on an inside wall, door, or table  top. Stretch evenly with tacks or small nails close together to avoid  drawing out in points and of the approximate shape of the finished rug.  That is, with the front feet well forward and hind feet pointing back,  not spread as wide as possible.    If you are intending to dress the skin it may be begun at once after  skinning, as per the chapter on tanning, etc., or after fleshing it may  be put in the pickle jar against a leisure day. Otherwise stretch and  dry for transportation or to send to the tanner.    [Illustration: HALF HEAD.    HEAD WITH TEETH.    PAPER HEAD FORMS--FOX]    As regards the mounting of heads for rugs, they may be done in three  styles, called half or mask head, full head closed mouth, and full head  open mouth. The first, as the name indicates, consists of the skin of  the upper part of the head without that of the lower jaw mounted over an  artificial form or \"skull.\" The closed mouth (See dog) has the lower jaw  mounted in addition, but without any teeth used, and the open mouth  mounting requires a set of suitable teeth with the interior of the  mouth, tongue and lips fully modeled and finished either with colored  wax or by painting.    These artificial head forms or skulls both with and without teeth and  masks, are to be had in all varieties and several sizes each of dealers  in taxidermists' supplies so cheaply that I would advise the novice to  procure them if possible. In many cases it is necessary for the  professional to make use of skulls with artificial teeth as the natural  skulls are often thrown away by the collector. In the case of any large  skin intended for a rug the roughly cleaned skull should accompany same.  In ordering from dealers it is only necessary to give name of animal and  the measure of skin from center of nose to inner corner of eye, and  outer corner of eye to ear.    [Illustration: DOG--CLOSED MOUTH.]    The beginner would do well to try mounting a rug with half head first  and the more difficult open mouth later. A very fair mask form can be  made by laying the skinned head down on a piece of thin board and  marking around it with pencil, then cutting out to the outline. With a  bunch of fine excelsior or coarse tow and a spool of thread a half-head  form can be roughly blocked out by winding, using the board as a base.  Then with modelling clay and chopped tow the anatomy is perfected,  pressing down here with the fingers, and building up elsewhere. With the  skinned head to refer to as the form is modeled a good job can be done.  However, if a number of skins of the same species are to be prepared it  is best to make a mould in which unlimited paper forms may be cast.  Particulars in this work are given in Chapter on Casting and Modelling.    [Illustration: FOUNDATION FOR TOW AND EXCELSIOR]    The next step in rug making after drying the pelt is to prepare the head  for mounting. It is as well to do little or no thinning down of the head  skin during the tanning and even if it has been shaved down the vicinity  of the eyes, ears, nose and lips will need thinning with a small sharp  knife, and stretching out with a skin scraper. Before beginning this  process the head skin should be dampened on the pelt side with clear  water (use pickle in warm weather). If the ears are not skinned before  dressing they should be now, and turned inside out to the tips. A small  screw driver with the edge blunted and rounded is a good tool for this  work as it will not readily cut the thin skin of the ears.    Trim and scrape away any lumps of muscle, etc., and shave down the skin  enough to be molded to the surface of the form when dampened. Do not,  however, cut away the bunch of muscles on each side of the cheeks in  which the whisker roots are embedded, or these distinguished ornaments  will drop out. By criss-crossing these with cuts they are made as  flexible as the rest of the skin. After the shaving process get a  suitable needle and stout thread and sew up any cuts or tears that have  been made. If proper care has been used there will be little of this to  do, always remembering that a cut is not irreparable but always makes  extra work. Bullet holes of large caliber destroy considerable skin and  in order to close them it is best to cut them to a triangular shape and  draw together by sewing up from the corners of the triangle, as per  illustration.    [Illustration: SEWING UP BULLET HOLE.]    Cut out from tough cardboard two ear forms a little longer at the base  than the ear skin and small enough to slip inside them readily. Before  going further give the inside of the head and neck skin a coat of  preservative. Let this lay a few minutes to soak in and then after  turning the ears right side out slip the cardboard ear forms into place.  They should be coated first with liquid glue; work the skin over them  with the fingers and fill around their bases with some cut tow and clay  of about the consistency of soft putty. Now place the head skin on the  form, get the eyes and nose in place and drive in a few pins down the  center of the face; they will hold it from slipping while working  further on it. If the form is a little too short for this particular  skin build it out with clay and tow, if too long it can have a trifle  cut off.    Fill the sockets of the eyes with clay, build out the cheeks and the  sides of nose with clay and tow and draw the skin of the lips down where  they belong. The glass eyes are to be cut from their wires and set,  drawing the lids around them with an awl. When they seem properly placed  drive pins at both inner and outer corners. The ears are attacked next  and when arranged to suit, three or four pins driven in at their bases  to hold them.    On a rug the ears should usually be laid back close to the head as by so  doing the chance of their being broken off when finished and dry is  lessened. Also a mounted rug head is usually intended to register rage  or anger.    The upper surface of the face being attended to, turn it upside down on  a folded bag or something in the nature of a cushion while we lace it  across the form with a stout thread and needle. If a hollow paper form  is used it should be filled with crumpled paper, excelsior, coarse tow  or similar material. Do not use fur scraps for this as I have seen done  or it will be a moth nest.    The whole inside of the skin may now be poisoned after slightly  dampening, and then tacked out fur side up in the proper shape to dry.  In order to make an animal skin lay flat to the floor it is necessary in  most cases to cut out several V-shaped pieces. Behind the fore legs  almost always and often in front of them, also and frequently in front  of the hind legs are the places where these gores are removed.  Consisting as they do of the thinly haired skin inside the legs their  absence is not noticeable when neatly sewed up.    Take care in this final stretching of the rug skin to get it alike on  both sides, or, as the artists say, bilaterally symmetrical. When tacked  out, go back to the face and perfect it so it may dry just right. With a  fine awl point draw the upper eyelids down a little, straighten the eye  brows, lashes and whiskers, and mould the nostrils into shape, bracing  them with damp clay; when dry it is easily removed. Now set it aside  until fully dry before proceeding with the trimming and lining. One and  a half or two inch wire brads are good to use in stretching skins, but  3d wire lath nails will do; the longer brads are more easily handled.    After removing the nails turn the skin on its back and draw a line from  neck to tail with pencil or chalk. By measuring from points on this line  we can trim off the legs and flanks of the rug evenly. If it is a small  or medium size skin it will look best with an all felt lining. So by  laying it flat on a piece of felt somewhat larger all round and marking  around it at a distance of 3 inches we can cut out the lining. The edge  of this is to be pinked. One end of our chopping block, usually of  sycamore or oak, is kept for this function, and a few minutes work with  pinking iron and hammer will border the lining with neat scallops.    A sufficient length of felt strips about 2 inches wide, should be cut to  reach around the outside of the skin, also pinked on one edge. Allow  generously for this as it will have to be gathered in rounding the feet  and head. In the case of animals having a bushy tail or brush as the  fox, wolf, etc., the tail is merely sewed up on the under side after  poisoning and not lined or trimmed. Pumas, tigers and others with short  furred tails are trimmed and lined like the rest of the rug. In lining  large rugs a double trimming of felt is often used and a lining of  strong canvas is used throughout, as when on the floor it is not  visible, protects the skin as well, and costs somewhat less.    [Illustration: PINKED LINING, BRIAR STITCHED.]    The trimming felt is sewed around the edge of the skin, passing the  needle through from the back obliquely, resulting in a long stitch on  the felt and a short one on the fur side. What few hairs are drawn down  by this can be picked out later with a needle or awl.    [Illustration: SEWING TRIMMING ON RUG.]    Before sewing the lining on an interlining of cotton wadding should be  cut out and basted in place with a few long "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23280"],[0,"The Shirley Letters from California Mines in 1851-52 (#11)"],[1,"people. The idea, and the really ingenious  mode of carrying it out, struck me as so singular, that I cannot  forbear attempting a description. These poor creatures were entirely  naked, with the exception of a quantity of grass bound round the waist,  and covering the thighs midway to the knees, perhaps. Each one carried  two brown baskets, which, I have since been told, are made of a species  of osier, woven with a neatness which is absolutely marvelous, when one  considers that they are the handiwork of such degraded wretches. Shaped  like a cone, they are about six feet in circumference at the opening,  and I should judge them to be nearly three feet in depth. It is  evident, by the grace and care with which they handle them, that they  are exceedingly light. It is possible that my description may be  inaccurate, for I have never read any account of them, and merely give  my own impressions as they were received while the wagon rolled rapidly  by the spot at which the women were at work. One of these queer baskets  is suspended from the back, and is kept in place by a thong of leather  passing across the forehead. The other they carry in the right hand and  wave over the flower-seeds, first to the right, and back again to the  left, alternately, as they walk slowly along, with a motion as regular  and monotonous as that of a mower. When they have collected a handful  of the seeds, they pour them into the basket behind, and continue this  work until they have filled the latter with their strange harvest. The  seeds thus gathered are carried to their rancherias, and stowed away  with great care for winter use. It was, to me, very interesting to  watch their regular motion, they seemed so exactly to keep time with  one another; and with their dark shining skins, beautiful limbs, and  lithe forms, they were by no means the least picturesque feature of the  landscape.    Ten miles this side of Bidwell's Bar, the road, hitherto so smooth and  level, became stony and hilly. For more than a mile we drove along the  edge of a precipice, and so near, that it seemed to me, should the  horses deviate a hairbreadth from their usual track, we must be dashed  into eternity. Wonderful to relate, I did not \"Oh!\" nor \"Ah!\" nor  shriek _once_, but remained crouched in the back of the wagon, as  silent as death. When we were again in safety, the driver exclaimed, in  the classic patois of New England, \"Wall, I guess yer the fust woman  that ever rode over that are hill without hollering.\" He evidently did  not know that it was the intensity of my _fear_ that kept me so still.    Soon Table Mountain became visible, extended like an immense  dining-board for the giants, its summit a perfectly straight line  penciled for more than a league against the glowing sky. And now we  found ourselves among the Red Hills, which look like an ascending sea  of crimson waves, each crest foaming higher and higher as we creep  among them, until we drop down suddenly into the pretty little valley  called Bidwell's Bar.    I arrived there at three o'clock in the evening, when I found F. in  much better health than when he left Marysville. As there was nothing  to sleep _in_ but a tent, and nothing to sleep _on_ but the ground, and  the air was black with the fleas hopping about in every direction, we  concluded to ride forward to the Berry Creek House, a ranch ten miles  farther on our way, where we proposed to pass the night.

The moon was just rising as we started. The air made one think of  fairy-festivals, of living in the woods _always_, with the green-coated  people for playmates, it was so wonderfully soft and cool, without the  least particle of dampness. A midsummer's night in the leafy month of  June, amid the dreamiest haunts of \"Old Crownest,\" could not be more  enchantingly lovely.    We sped merrily onward until nine o'clock, making the old woods echo  with song and story and laughter, for F. was unusually gay, and I was  in tip-top spirits. It seemed to me so _funny_ that we two people  should be riding on mules, all by ourselves, in these glorious  latitudes, night smiling down so kindly upon us, and, funniest of  _all_, that we were going to live in the Mines! In spite of my gayety,  however, I now began to wonder why we did not arrive at our intended  lodgings. F. reassured me by saying that when we had _de_scended this  hill or _as_cended that, we should certainly be there. But ten o'clock  came; eleven, twelve, one, _two_! but no Berry Creek House! I began to  be frightened, and besides that, was very sick with a nervous headache.  At every step we were getting higher and higher into the mountains, and  even F. was at last compelled to acknowledge that we were _lost!_ We  were on an Indian trail, and the bushes grew so low that at almost  every step I was obliged to bend my forehead to my mule's neck. This  increased the pain in my head to an almost insupportable degree. At  last I told F. that I could not remain in the saddle a moment longer.  Of course there was nothing to do but to camp. Totally unprepared for  such a catastrophe, we had nothing but the blankets of our mules, and a  thin quilt in which I had rolled some articles necessary for the  journey, because it was easier to pack than a traveling-bag. F. told me  to sit on the mule while he prepared my woodland couch, but I was too  nervous for that, and so jumped off and dropped onto the ground, worn  out with fatigue and pain. The night was still dreamily beautiful, and  I should have been enchanted with the adventure (for I had fretted and  complained a good deal, because we had no _excuse_ for camping out) had  it not been for that impertinent headache, which, you remember, always  _would_ visit me at the most inconvenient seasons.    About daylight, somewhat refreshed, we again mounted our mules,  confidently believing that an hour's ride would bring us to the Berry  Creek House, as we supposed, of course, that we had camped in its  immediate vicinity. We tried more than a dozen paths, which, as they  led _nowhere_, we would retrace to the principal trail. At last F.  determined to keep upon one, as it _must_, he thought, in _time_, lead  us out of the mountains, even if we landed on the other side of  California. Well, we rode on, and on, and on, up hill and down hill,  down hill and up, through fir-groves and oak-clumps, and along the edge  of dark ravines, until I thought that I should go _mad_, for all this  time the sun was pouring down its hottest rays most pitilessly, and I  had an excruciating pain in my head and in all my limbs.    About two o'clock we struck the main trail, and, meeting a man,--the  first human being that we had seen since we left Bidwell's,--were told  that we were seven miles from the Berry Creek House, and that we had  been down to the North Fork of the American River, more than thirty  miles out of our way! This joyful news gave us fresh strength, and we  rode on as fast as our worn-out mules could go.    Although we had eaten nothing since noon the day before, I bore up  bravely until we arrived within two miles of the rancho, when courage  and strength both gave way, and I _implored_ F. to let me lie down  under a tree and rest for a few hours. He very wisely refused, knowing  that if I dismounted it would be impossible to get me onto my mule  again, and we should be obliged to spend another night under the stars,  which, in this enchanting climate, would have been delightful, had we  possessed any food; but, knowing that I needed refreshment even more  than I did rest, he was compelled to insist upon my proceeding.    My poor husband! He must have had a trying time with me, for I sobbed  and cried like the veriest child, and repeatedly declared that I should  never live to get to the rancho. F. said afterwards that he began to  think I intended to keep my word, for I certainly _looked_ like a  dying person.    O Mary! it makes me _shudder_ when I think of the mad joy with which I  saw that rancho! Remember that, with the exception of three or four  hours the night before, we had been in the saddle for nearly twenty-four  hours without refreshment. When we stopped, F. carried me into the  house and laid me"]]]
