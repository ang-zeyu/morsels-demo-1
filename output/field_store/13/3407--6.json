His suddenness took Tad Sobber off his guard.    \"What if it was?\" he demanded in return.    \"I don't like it, that's all.\"    \"Humph! I don't care whether you like it or not,\" grunted Sobber.    \"See here, Tad Sobber, let us have an understanding,\" said Dick, calmly.  \"I understand that you are trying to bully everybody in this school.  Now, this cannot be. We have had several bullies here and we have gotten  rid of them all. We want no more.\"    \"Humph! Trying to be the bully yourself, eh?\" sneered Sobber.    \"No, I am only giving you warning. The other boys have told me about  you.\"    \"Tad has a right to act as he pleases,\" put in Nick Pell.    \"No, he has not. Captain Putnam expects every student here to be a  gentleman.\"    \"Oh, don't preach, Rover,\" cried Tad Sobber. \"I can take care of myself  without your advice.\"    \"Well, I warn you to keep your distance so far as I am concerned and  keep a civil tongue in your head,\" said Dick.    What this war of words might have led to there is no telling. Just at  that moment the school bell rang, and all of the students had to hurry  to their respective classes.    It may be mentioned here that Sam, Tom and Dick were now in the same  grade. This may be wondered at, but the fact of the matter was that Sam,  by hard work the term previous, had caught up to Tom, while Dick,  because of being away on some business for his father at various times,  had dropped a little behind.    \"Had a little run-in with Sobber,\" said Dick to his brothers, when he  got the chance, and related the particulars.    \"He said something about me behind my back,\" said Sam. \"I don't know  what it was, but I am certain it was nothing complimentary.\"    \"We must watch him,\" said Tom. \"If we do not, he may try to play us  foul.\"    As this was to be their last term at Putnam Hall, all of the Rovers  determined to do their best in their studies, so they spent no time in  fooling while at their classes. Once or twice Tom found it hard to  resist playing a joke, but a look from Dick usually made him turn to his  books again.    It was now the season for football, and several school teams had been  organized. Tom and Dick were on one team, headed by Larry Colby. There  was another team headed by Tad Sobber, and on this Nick Pell was a  quarterback. How Sobber had ever gotten the captaincy of this team was a  mystery.    \"They want to play us next Saturday,\" said Larry, one afternoon. \"What  do you fellows say?\" He put the question to his fellow members of the  eleven.    \"I don't care much to play Sobber and Pell,\" said Tom, promptly.    \"Exactly the way I feel about it,\" added Dick. \"But I'll play if the  rest want to.\"    Some demurred, but in the end the match was arranged, and it started on  the school grounds at two o'clock the following Saturday afternoon.    \"I think it will be useless to try any mass playing,\" said Larry.  \"Sobber and Pell and some of the others are too heavy for us. We'll have  to trust to some swift passes and quick runs.\"    In the first half of the game Sobber's eleven got ten points, while  Larry's team got nothing.    \"Sobber is too brutal for me,\" said Tom. \"He deliberately kicked me in  the shins.\"    \"If he does it again, knock him down,\" advised Dick, promptly.    Larry's eleven went into the second half with vigor. They soon got a  goal and followed it up by two more. Then Sobber claimed a foul, but it  was not granted.    \"If anybody is fouling it is you,\" said Dick. \"You fouled Tom twice. If  you do it again----\"    \"Never mind, Dick,\" interrupted Larry. \"Go on and play, or give up,\" he  added to Tad Sobber.    \"I want Dick Rover to understand that he----\" began Sobber, when another  player pulled him back. Some hot words followed, and then the game  proceeded. Larry's eleven made another touchdown and kicked the  goal,--and thus won a substantial victory, much to Sobber's disgust and  that of his crony, Nick Pell.    \"No use of talking, those Rover boys make me sick,\" said Sobber, when he  and Nick Pell were alone. \"Everybody in this school seems to toady to  them.\"    \"If I had been you I'd have pitched into Dick Rover on the gridiron,\"  answered Pell.    \"Well, I wanted to, but the others wouldn't have it. But I'll polish him  off some day--and polish off Tom, too,\" added Sobber, uglily.    Two of the small boys of the school had been taken sick, and in order to  keep them quiet they were removed to the top floor of the institution,  and one of the colored waiters was ordered to carry their meals up to  them. Dick knew both of the lads, and he frequently went up to pay them  a visit and cheer them up a bit.    One day he was just returning from a visit to the sick students when he  heard a noise in the hallway on the second floor. He looked down the  stairs and saw Tom and Tad Sobber near a landing, having a wordy  quarrel. Nick Pell was approaching and so were Fred and Hans.    \"For two pins I'd give you a good thrashing, Rover,\" the bully was  saying. \"You can't lord it over me, understand that.\"    \"Well, I want you to keep your distance, Tad Sobber,\" returned Tom. \"And  I stick to it that you kicked me on purpose during the football game.\"    Both boys were walking to the stairs landing, and Dick and the others  who heard the words followed. Then of a sudden the crowd that was  gathered saw Sobber catch Tom by the throat.    \"Le--let go!\" gasped Tom.    \"Take that!\" retorted the bully, and banged Tom's head against the wall.    There was a scuffle near the stairs, and both boys fell up against the  railing.    \"Look out, Tom!\" cried Dick. \"He'll throw you down the stairs!\" And he  tried to go to his brother's assistance. But before he could reach the  spot the two contestants had separated.    \"That for you!\" roared Sobber, and aimed a blow for Tom's eye. Tom  dodged, and then let out with his right fist. The blow landed on the  bully's chin. He tottered backward, lost his balance, and pitched down  the stairs.    Just as the bully went backwards, a side door of the mess hall opened  and the colored waiter who carried the food to the sick lads upstairs  came out. He held a trayful of dainties in his hands. Crash! came Sobber  into the tray, and he and the dishes and the waiter went to the floor in  a confused heap.    [Illustration: CRASH! CAME SOBBER INTO THE TRAY.]    \"Fo' de lan' sake!\" gasped the waiter. \"What fo' you dun dat to me?\"    \"Oh!\" groaned the bully, and tried to get up. On one cheek he had a dab  of jelly and his hand and shirt front were covered with broth. The sight  was such a comical one that the boys on the landing could not help but  laugh.    \"Yo' dun bust de whole dinnah up!\" was the waiter's comment, as he arose  and surveyed the wreck. The food had been scattered in all directions  and half of the dishes were broken.    \"It wasn't my fault!\" growled Tad Sobber. \"Tom Rover knocked me down the  stairs.\"    \"It was your own fault,\" cried Tom. \"You started the fight, I didn't.\"    \"Somebody's got to pay fo' dis smash,\" said the waiter. \"I ain't gwine  to do it. Why, I ought to sue yo' fo' damages, dat's wot!\" he added,  glaring wrathfully at Sobber.    \"I'll fix Tom Rover for this!\" exclaimed the bully, and looked up the  stairs at the laughing students. \"I'll make him laugh on the other side  of his face!\"    And he ran up the stairs with the intention of attacking Tom again.          CHAPTER XIII    DORA, GRACE AND NELLIE      That Tad Sobber was in a thorough rage was easily to be seen. His eyes  were full of hate and he looked ready to fly at Tom and tear him to  pieces.    All of the boys expected to see a great fight, and some backed away from  the landing, to give the contestants more room.    But before anything could be done Dick leaped to the front and barred  the bully's further progress.    \"Stop it, Sobber,\" he said quietly but firmly.    \"Get out of my way, Dick Rover!\" roared the bully. \"This is none of your  affair.\"    \"Then I'll make it my affair,\" answered the eldest Rover boy. \"You shall  not attack my brother here.\"    \"Don't worry, Dick--I can take care of him,\" put in Tom, undauntedly,  and doubled up his fists. \"Maybe he'd like to go down stairs again and  smash some more dishes.\"    \"Not when John Fly am carryin' dem,\" put in the colored waiter, who  stood looking at the wreckage with a sober face. \"I don't want no moah  such knockovers, I don't!\" And he shook his woolly head decidedly.    The noise had summoned numerous cadets to the scene, and now George  Strong, the head teacher, appeared.    \"What is the trouble here?\" he demanded.    For the moment nobody answered him, and he gazed in wonderment at the  broken dishes and the scattered food.    \"Been a accident, sah,\" said John Fly. \"Dat young gen'man dun fall down  de stairs an' knock me ober, tray an' all, sah.\"    \"Did you fall down stairs, Sobber?\"    \"No, sir, I was thrown down by Tom Rover,\" replied the bully.    \"Thrown down?\" repeated the head teacher in surprise.    \"He attacked me and I hit back,\" explained Tom. \"It was his own fault  that he fell down stairs. Had he let me alone there would have been no  trouble.\"    \"It is false--he hit me first,\" said the bully.    \"That is not so,\" cried Fred. \"Sobber struck the first blow.\"    \"Yah, dot is der fact alretty,\" put in Hans. \"He vos caught Dom py der  throat und knock his head py der vall chust so hard like nefer vos!\"    \"He hit me first, didn't he, Nick?\" said the bully, turning to his  crony.    \"I--I think he did,\" stammered Nick Pell. He did not dare to tell an  outright falsehood. \"I think it was all Tom Rover's fault,\" he added,  after a surly look from Sobber.    \"All of you know it is against the rules to fight in this school,\" said  Mr. Strong, sternly.    \"Wel"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22168"],[0,"The Golden Spears (#11)"],[1,"the brehons, the great judges of the land, and the chief bards of the  high court of Tara, and the Druids, crowned with oak leaves, and  carrying wands of divination in their hands.    When the royal party reached the ground it took its place in inclosures  right up against the monumental mound. The High King sat with the four  kings of Erin, all wearing their golden helmets, for they wore their  diadems in battle only. In an inclosure next the king's sat the queen  and the princess and all the ladies of the court. At either side of the  royal pavilions were others for the dames and ladies and nobles and  chiefs of different degrees, forming part of a circle on the plain, and  the stands and benches for the people were so arranged as to complete  the circle, and in the round green space within it, so that all might  hear and see, the contests were to take place.    At a signal from the king, who was greeted with a thunderous cheer, the  heralds rode round the circle, and having struck their sounding shields  three times with their swords, they made a solemn proclamation of peace.  Then was sung by all the assembled bards, to the accompaniment of their  harps, the chant in honor of the mighty dead. When this was ended, again  the heralds struck their shields, and the contests began. The first  contest was the contest of spear-throwing between the champions of the  seven battalions of the Feni. When the seven champions took their places  in front of the royal inclosure, everyone, even the proud princess, was  struck by the manly beauty and noble bearing of Fergus.    The champions poised their spears, and at a stroke from the heralds upon  their shields the seven spears sped flashing through the air. They all  struck the ground, shafts up, and it was seen that two were standing  side by side in advance of the rest, one belonged to Fergus, the other  to the great chief, Oscar. The contest for the prize then lay between  Oscar and Fergus, and when they stood in front of the king, holding  their spears aloft, every heart was throbbing with excitement. Once more  the heralds struck their shields, and, swifter than the lightning's  flash, forth went the spears, and when Fergus's spear was seen shivering  in the ground a full length ahead of the great chief Oscar's, the air was  shaken by a wild cheer that was heard far beyond the plains of Tara. And  as Fergus approached the high king to receive the prize the cheers were  renewed. But Fergus thought more of the winsome glance of the princess  than he did of the prize or the sounding cheers. And Princess Maureen  was almost sorry for her vow, for her heart was touched by the beauty  of the Fenian champion.    Other contests followed, and the day passed, and the night fell, and  while the Fenian warriors were reveling in their camps the heart of  Fergus, victor as he was, was sad and low. He escaped from his  companions, and stole away to his native forest, for--      \"When the heart is sick and sorest,     There is balsam in the forest--     There is balsam in the forest                         For its pain.\"      And as he lay under the spreading branches, watching the stars glancing  through the leaves, and listening to the slumb'rous murmur of the  waters, a strange peace came over him.    But in the camp which he had left, and in the vast multitude on the plains  of Tara, there was stir and revelry, and babbling speculation as to the  contest of to-morrow--the contest which was to decide whether the chief  bard of Erin was to hold his own against all comers, or yield the palm.  For rumor said that a great Skald had come from the northern lands to  compete with the Irish bard.    At last, over the Fenian camp, and over the great plain and the  multitude that thronged it, sleep fell, clothing them with a silence as  deep as that which dwelt in the forest, where, dreaming of the princess,  Fergus lay. He awoke at the first notes of the birds, but though he felt  he ought to go back to his companions and be witness of the contest  which might determine whether the princess was to be another's bride,  his great love and his utter despair of winning her so oppressed him  that he lay as motionless as a broken reed. He scarcely heard the music  of the birds, and paid no heed to the murmur of the brook rushing by his  feet. The crackling of branches near him barely disturbed him, but when  a shadow fell across his eyes he looked up gloomily, and saw, or thought  he saw, someone standing before him. He started up, and who should he see  but the little wizened old man who found shelter in his father's hut on  the stormy night.    \"This is a nice place for a battle champion to be. This is a nice place  for _you_ to be on the day which is to decide who will be the successful  suitor of the princess.\"    \"What is it to me,\" said Fergus, \"who is to win her since I cannot?\"    \"I told you,\" said the little man, \"the night you opened the door for  me, that the time might come when I might be able to do a good turn for  you and yours. The time has come. Take this harp, and my luck go with  you, and in the contest of the bards to-day you'll reap the reward of  the kindness you did when you opened your door to the poor old wayfarer  in the midnight storm.\"    The little man handed his harp to Fergus and disappeared as swiftly as  the wind that passes through the leaves.    Fergus, concealing the harp under his silken cloak, reached the camp  before his comrades had aroused themselves from sleep.    At length the hour arrived when the great contest was to take place.    The king gave the signal, and as the chief bard of Erin was seen  ascending the mound in front of the royal inclosures he was greeted with  a roar of cheers, but at the first note of his harp silence like that of  night fell on the mighty gathering.    As he moved his fingers softly over the strings every heart was hushed,  filled with a sense of balmy rest. The lark soaring and singing above  his head paused mute and motionless in the still air, and no sound was  heard over the spacious plain save the dreamy music. Then the bard  struck another key, and a gentle sorrow possessed the hearts of his  hearers, and unbidden tears gathered to their eyes. Then, with bolder  hand, he swept his fingers across his lyre, and all hearts were moved  to joy and pleasant laughter, and eyes that had been dimmed by tears  sparkled as brightly as running waters dancing in the sun. When the last  notes had died away a cheer arose, loud as the voice of the storm in the  glen when the live thunder is reveling on the mountain tops. As soon as  the bard had descended the mound the Skald from the northern lands took  his place, greeted by cries of welcome from a hundred thousand throats.  He touched his harp, and in the perfect silence was heard the strain of  the mermaid's song, and through it the pleasant ripple of summer waters  on the pebbly beach. Then the theme was changed, and on the air was  borne the measured sweep of countless oars and the swish of waters  around the prows of contending galleys, and the breezy voices of the  sailors and the sea-bird's cry. Then his theme was changed to the mirth  and laughter of the banquet-hall, the clang of meeting drinking-horns,  and songs of battle. When the last strain ended, from the mighty host a  great shout went up, loud as the roar of winter billows breaking in the  hollows of the shore; and men knew not whom to declare the victor, the  chief bard of Erin or the Skald of the northern lands.    In the height of the debate the cry arose that another competitor had  ascended the mound, and there standing in view of all was Fergus, the  huntsman's son. All eyes were fastened upon him, but no one looked so  eagerly as the princess.    He touched his harp with gentle fingers, and a sound low and soft as  a faint summer breeze passing through forest trees stole out, and then  was heard the rustle of birds through the branches, and the dreamy  murmur of waters lost in deepest woods, and all the fairy echoes  whispering when the leaves are motionless in the noonday heat; then  followed notes cool and soft as the drip of summer showers on the  parched grass, and then the song of the blackbird, sounding as clearly  as it sounds in long silent spaces of the evening, and then in one sweet  jocund burst the multitudinous voices that hail the breaking of the  morn. And the lark, singing and soaring above the minstrel, sank mute  and motionless upon his shoulder, and from all the leafy woods the birds  came thronging out and formed a fluttering canopy above his head.    When the bard ceased playing no shout arose from the mighty multitude,  for the strains of his harp, long after its chords were stilled, held  their hearts spellbound.    And when he had passed away from the mound of contest all knew there was  no need to declare the victor.[9] And all were glad the comely Fenian  champion had maintained the supremacy of the bards of Erin. But there  was one heart sad, the heart of the princess; and now she wished more  than ever that she had never made her hateful vow.    Other contests went on, but Fergus took no interest in them; and once  more he stole away to the forest glade. His heart was sorrowful, for he  thought of the great race of the morning, and he knew that he could not  hope to compete with the rider of the white steed of the plains. And as  he lay beneath the spreading branches during the whole night long his  thoughts were not of the victory he had won, but of the princess, who  was as far away from him as ever. He passed the night without sleep, and  when the morning came he rose and walked aimlessly through the woods.    A deer starting from a thicket reminded him of the happy days of his  boyhood, and once more the wish came back to him that he had never left  his forest home. As his eyes followed the deer wistfully, suddenly he  started in amazement. The deer vanished from"]]]
