Mr  Anderson was observing: \"What a bouncing fellow that must be,\" when  another bark nearer to them was heard, and presently a third,  accompanied by a growl a short distance further.  Coming to an opening  in the bushes, three enormous lions of a dusky colour were seen bounding  over the long grass, abreast of each other, towards them.  Fearing that,  should they come near, and his piece miss fire, the lions would seize  them, Park advanced and shot at the centre one.  The animals stopped,  looked at each other, and then bounded away, and, though one again  stopped while he was loading his piece, they all disappeared.  The  lions, however, followed him; but Mr Anderson having a boatswain's  call, Park took it and whistled, and made as much noise as possible, so  that they did not again molest him.  Notwithstanding Mr Anderson's  reduced condition he persevered in travelling, and, being placed in a  hammock constructed out of a cloak, was carried along by two men.  Mr  Scott, however, complaining of sickness, shortly afterwards dropped  behind.    On entering Doomblia during heavy rain, greatly to his satisfaction Park  met Kafa Taura, the worthy negro merchant who had been so kind to him on  his former journey.  He had now come a considerable distance to see him.    From hence he sent back to enquire for Mr Scott, but no information  could be obtained about him.    On the 19th of August the sad remnant of the expedition ascended the  mountainous ridge which separates the Niger from the remote branches of  the Senegal.  Mr Park hastened on ahead, and, coming to the brow of the  hill, once more saw the mighty river making its way in a broad stream  through the plain.    Descending from thence towards Bambakoo, the travellers pitched their  tents under a tree near that town.    Of the thirty-four soldiers and four carpenters who left the Gambia,  only six soldiers and one carpenter reached the Niger, three having died  during the previous day's march.    As the only canoe Park could obtain would carry but two persons besides  their goods, he and Mr Anderson embarked in it, leaving Mr Martyn and  the men to come down by land with the asses.  He himself was suffering  greatly from dysentery.  In the evening they landed on some flat rocks  near the shore, and were cooking their supper, when the rain came down,  and continued with great violence all night.    The next day Mr Martyn and the rest of the people overtook them.    On the following day Isaaco, having performed the task he had  undertaken, of guiding them to the Niger, received the payment agreed  on; and Park likewise gave him several articles, and told him that when  the palaver was adjusted at Sego, he should have all the horses and  asses for his trouble.    He here also prepared the present he purposed to offer to Mansong, the  king of Bambarra, and which he sent forward to Sego by Isaaco.    Every day brought them some unfavourable news or other.  At one time it  was reported that Mansong had killed Isaaco with his own hand, and  threatened to do the same with all the whites who should come into  Bambarra.  These reports proved to be false, for Isaaco himself arrived  in a canoe from Sego, bringing back all the articles sent to Mansong,  who had directed that they should be taken up to Samee, and that he  would send a person to receive them from Park's own hands.  Mansong had  promised that the expedition should pass, but whenever Isaaco mentioned  it particularly, or related any incident that had happened on the  journey, Mansong began to make squares and triangles in the sand before  him with his finger, and continued to do so as long as Isaaco spoke  about them.  This the superstitious monarch probably did to defend  himself against the supposed incantations of the white man.    On the 22nd of September the chief counsellor of Mansong, Modibinne, and  four grandees, arrived by a canoe, bringing a fat milk-white bullock as  a present.  Next morning Modibinne and the grandees came to the camp and  desired Park to acquaint them with the motives which had induced him to  come into their country.  Park explained them, telling them that it was  his wish to sail down the Joliba, or Niger, to the place where it mixes  with the salt water, and that if the navigation was found open, the  white men would send up vessels to trade at Sego, should Mansong wish  it.  Modibinne replied that the object of the journey was a good one,  and prayed that God would prosper it, adding, \"Mansong will protect  you.\"    The presents intended for the king were then spread out, and appeared to  give great satisfaction.  Two more soldiers died that evening.  On the  26th the expedition, in open canoes, left Samee.  Park felt himself very  unwell, and the heat was intense, sufficient to have roasted a sirloin.  Isaaco, however, having formed an awning over the canoe with four sticks  and a couple of cloaks, Park found himself better.    On the 2nd two other privates died, the body of one of whom the wolves  carried off, the door of the hut having been left open.    Wishing to obtain cowries, Park opened a market at Marroboo to dispose  of his goods, and so great was the demand for them that he had to employ  three tellers at once to count his cash.  In one day he turned 25,756  pieces of money-cowries.    The sad news now reached him of the Mr Scott's death, and on the 28th  of October his brother-in-law, Mr Anderson, breathed his last.  \"No  event,\" Park remarks, \"which took place during the journey ever threw  the smallest gloom over his mind till he laid Mr Anderson in the grave.  He then felt himself left a second time lonely and friendless amidst  the wilds of Africa.\"    Some days before this, Isaaco had returned with a large canoe, but much  decayed and patched.  Park, therefore, with the assistance of Bolton,  one of the surviving soldiers, took out all the rotten pieces, and, by  adding on the portion of another canoe, with eighteen days' hard labour  they changed the Bambarra canoe into his Majesty's schooner \"Joliba.\"  Her length was forty feet, breadth six feet; and, being flat-bottomed,  she drew only one foot of water when loaded.  In this craft he and his  surviving companions embarked on the 16th of November, on which day his  journal closes.  He intended next morning to commence his adventurous  voyage down the Joliba.  Besides Park and Lieutenant Martyn, two  Europeans only survived.  They had purchased three slaves to assist in  the navigation of the vessel, and Isaaco had engaged Amadi Fatouma to  succeed him as interpreter.  This increased their number to nine.    Descending the stream, they passed the Silla and Jenne without  molestation; but lower down, in the neighbourhood of Timbuctoo, they  were followed by armed canoes, which they beat off, killing several of  the natives.  They had, indeed, to fight their way down past a number of  places, once striking on the rocks, and being nearly overset by a  hippopotamus which rose near them.    Having a large stock of provisions, they were able to proceed without  going on shore.  Amadi was the only person who landed in order to get  fresh provisions.    At Yaour Park sent a present to the king by one of the chiefs, but, the  chief inquiring whether he intended to return, Park replied that he had  no purpose of doing so.  This induced the chief to withhold the presents  from the king, and who, accordingly, indignant at being thus treated,  put Amadi into irons, took all his goods from him, and sent a force to  occupy a rock overhanging the river where it narrows greatly.  On  arriving at this place, Park endeavoured to pass through, when the  people began to throw lances and stones at him.  He and his companions  defended themselves for a long time, till two of his slaves in the stern  of the boat were killed.    Finding no hopes of escape, Park took hold of one of the white men and  jumped into the water, and Martyn did the same, hoping to reach the  shore, but were drowned in the attempt.  The only slave remaining in the  boat, seeing the natives persist in throwing their weapons, entreated  them to stop.  On this they took possession of the canoe and the man,  and carried them to the king.  Amadi, after being kept in irons three  months, was liberated, and on finding the slave who had been taken in  the canoe, learned from him the manner in which Mr Park and his  companions had perished.  The only article left in the canoe had been a  sword-belt, which Isaaco, who was afterwards despatched to learn  particulars of the tragedy, obtained--the sole relic of the expedition.    Park could not have been aware of the numerous rapids and other  difficulties he would have had to encounter on descending the upper  portion of the Niger.  In all probability his frail and ill-constructed  vessel would have been wrecked before he had proceeded many miles below  the spot where he lost his life.  Had he, however, succeeded in passing  that dangerous portion, he might have navigated the mighty stream to its  mouth.    Although at first the account of Park's death was not believed in  England, subsequent enquiries left no doubt that all the statements were  substantially correct.    Thus perished, in the prime of life, that heroic traveller, at the very  time when he had good reason to believe that he was about to solve the  problem of the Niger's course.        CHAPTER FIVE.

The second of these phases was the introduction in the body of a  theme or melody, and also at its close, of embellishments. Sometimes  the composer briefly sketched these ornaments; at other times their  places only were indicated. The ornaments in the body of an air are  known as _abbellimenti_ or _fioriture_; those at its close, as  _cadenze_.    Here is an example of the former, taken from the duet in _Elisa e  Claudio_ by Mercadante:    [Music: Se un istante all'offerta d'un soglio vacillasse il mio genio  primiero.]    The following is the same passage ornamented:    [Music: Se un istante all'offerta d'un soglio vacillasse il mio genio  primiero]    (As sung by Mme. Malibran. Quoted from \"_Mecanisme des Traits_,\" by de  La Madelaine, 1868.)    The role of Rosina in Rossini's _Il Barbiere_ has long been a  favourite peg with prime donne on which to hang interpolated ornaments  for the display of their vocal agility. Some of these are not always  in good taste, being trivial or banal in character, thus concealing  the natural charm of the original melody under a species of Henri Herz  variations. Others, however, such as those used by the Patti and the  Sembrich, for instance, are of great originality and excellent effect.    Here are some of the traditional ornaments and cadenzas sung by  certain famous singers of the past in Rosina's entrance cavatina:  \"_Una voce poco fa_.\" This air was originally written by Rossini in  _E_ major, the part of Rosina being intended for a mezzo-soprano, and  was thus sung by the late Paulina Viardot-Garcia. This exceptionally  gifted artist, possessing a voice of very great compass, was enabled  to sing not only the roles assigned to mezzo-soprano contraltos, such  as Orphee, or Fides (_Le Prophete_), which she created, but also the  parts given to dramatic sopranos. Mme. Viardot was thus able, with  some slight modifications, to sing Norma, Desdemona (_Otello_:  Rossini), Rachel (_La Juive_), etc.    The role of Rosina has now definitely passed into the possession of  florid or _coloratura_ sopranos; much, therefore, of the music is of  necessity transposed, the air in question being now sung one half-tone  higher, in the key of _F_.    Here is a change used by Mme. Cinti-Damoreau, who sang the music in  the original key. The composer wrote:    [Music: Si Lindoro mio sara.]    Mme. Cinti-Damoreau sang thus:    [Music: Si Lindoro mio sara.]    In the same bar Mlle. Henrietta Sontag, who sang the air a semitone  higher, introduced the following:    [Music: Si Lindoro mio sara.]    Rossini wrote no cadenza to the air:    [Music: lo vincero!]    Cadenza of Mlle. Sontag:    [Music: Ah! ah! ah! lo vincero!]    I have already spoken of the bad taste exhibited by some mediocre  singers in covering a coloratura air with so many roulades, etc., as  to render it barely recognizable. It was after hearing one of his own  arias overloaded and disfigured in this manner that Rossini, who was  noted for his biting wit and stinging sarcasms, is said to have  remarked: \"What charming music! Whom is it by?\"    Bellini, Donizetti, and composers of their school, sometimes did  little more than hand over to the singer engaged to create their works  a rough sketch, as it were, which the artists were supposed to fill in  and perfect. Singers were expected to add such _fioriture_, or  \"flowers,\" as would best display their salient points of style and  individual characteristics. The Cavatina, or slow movement of the  aria, was the medium which called for the qualities of expressive  singing, while the Cabaletta was a vehicle for the display of  virtuosity and technical mastery. In this latter movement, the  equivalent of the Rondo in instrumental music, the performer was left  perfectly free to use such embellishments as set forth his own gifts  to the greatest advantage. Some singers excelled in bold and rapid  flights of scales, chromatic and diatonic; others, in the neat and  clean-cut execution of involved _traits_ or figures. It must be  remembered, that the great singers of the past were perfectly  competent to add these ornaments themselves, as they possessed a  complete and sound musical education.    More: sometimes these singers even collaborated with the composers.  Crescentini, the last famous male sopranist, is reputed by history or  legend--the two are not infrequently synonymous--to have been himself  the composer of the well-known aria \"_Ombra adorata_,\" introduced by  him in Zingarelli's opera _Romeo e Giulietta_, as also of the prayer  sung by Romeo in the same work. His singing of it is said to have  moved his audience to tears, and gained for him the decoration of the  Iron Crown, conferred upon him by Napoleon I. The Emperor also  induced him, by the offer of a large salary, to settle in Paris as  professor of singing.    When these great artists--their career as public singers being  ended--began in turn to form pupils, they were admirably fitted for  the task of imparting instruction, being excellent musicians, and, as  I have said, composers of no insignificant merit. They had a sound  theoretical knowledge, compared with which that of many of our modern  singers seems but a pale and feeble reflection.    The collaboration of composer and interpreter is not altogether  unknown in the domain of instrumental music. Is it not historical that  Mendelssohn profited largely from the wise counsels of the celebrated  violinist Ferdinand David in the composition of his concerto for  violin and orchestra? This does not mean that David contributed any  musical phrases or ideas to the work; but that his practical knowledge  of the special characteristics and capabilities of the solo instrument  enabled him to suggest how the composer's thoughts might be most  fittingly presented.    Returning to the question of the introduction of ornaments, etc., into  a composer's work, the following extract may be of interest to the  musical student. It is from a volume of criticism, now out of print, a  copy of which is possessed by the present writer. The article appeared  in _La Patrie_ more than forty years ago, and was called forth by the  ornaments written by the then well-known singer and teacher of great  ability, Stephan de La Madelaine. These changes were for the great  air of Agathe in the second act of _Der Freischuetz_, and were the  cause of much discussion among the music-critics of the time.    \"Following the example of celebrated vocal virtuosi whom he had  formerly known, and availing himself of the license then permitted,  the master (de La Madelaine) has introduced several alterations  (_changements_). These, however, in no sense clash with the original  character of the air itself.    \"That the introduction of such ornaments has caused an outcry, is not  surprising. We should remember, however, that the _Freischuetz_ was  written at a period when, in certain places, the composer left the  field entirely open to the singer, permitted him to make such changes  as he might deem necessary. It must not be thought that in so doing  the interpreter corrects the composer: he simply seeks to express, to  the utmost of his abilities, the intention of the author.    \"The operas of Bellini, of Rossini, and, in general, of all the  Italian masters, are full of these intentional gaps (_lacunes_) which  were filled in by the singers. Nay, in the earliest days of the  Neapolitan school, still greater liberty was allowed; the recitatives  were all improvised by the executants, and were not even noted down.  Each singer made his own, which the _maestro al cembalo_ accompanied  with a few simple chords.    \"In the cavatina in _Norma_, each _cantatrice_ introduces her own  changes on the recurrence of the principal theme, and the public  applauds. Why then this outcry against the same procedure in _Der  Freischuetz_?    \"_That this custom or practice might lead to great abuse and that it  is necessary to uproot it gradually, is our opinion._ But this radical  reform can be realized only in forthcoming works; those of the ancient  school ought to be interpreted by following the conventions which the  composer himself has respected.    \"That the _changements_ written by M. de La Madelaine for the air of  the _Freischuetz_ are permissible, is proved by the fact that Weber  himself has sanctioned and approved them, as, if need be, a great  number of contemporaries can attest.\" (FRANCK-MARIE.)    Whoever has had the good fortune to hear Mme. Marcella Sembrich in the  role of Amina, in Bellini's _La Sonnambula_, will have heard an  excellent example of remarkable technical skill or virtuosity, with  irreproachable taste regulating its display. The ornaments and changes  used by her in the _rondo finale_, \"_Ah, non giunge_,\" are models of  their genre. What else could be expected of an artist so gifted as to  be able to perform the lesson-scene in Rossini's _Il Barbiere_  (introducing therein the air with variations by Proch) in Italian; and  in the course of the same scene sing, in German, \"_Ich liebe dich_,\"  by Grieg, and play the Andante and Rondo Russe, for violin, by de  Beriot, and a valse by Chopin on the piano?    The opera, _La Sonnambula_, requires much rearrangement both of the  music and of the verbal text, to which it is badly fitted. The greater  part of the music written for Elvino has to be transposed, mostly a  third lower, in order to make it practicable under existing  conditions.    No effect whatever could be made were a cantatrice to follow  implicitly the written notes of this opera, such being merely a rough  sketch, as it were, of the composer's ideas, which the singer is  supposed to complete. Several instances from the andante \"_Ah! non  credea mirarti_,\" will suffice"]]]
