[3] Make it Anglo Saxons, if you like!    [Illustration]    \"The-most-beautiful-lady-in-the-ship,\" in dark muslin, and the  stalwart-man stand near us to-night; they are in half-light, leaning  against the rail, looking out into the darkness. I wished Whistler  might have seen them; he alone could have caught the soft night  colours--the black so velvety and colourful, blurred into the dark blue  of the night sky, with never the suggestion of an outline, and just one  touch of subdued warm colour on the bend of her neck. Sometimes her  scarf floats lightly across his sleeve and rests, and floats away again.  I suppose they talk of--the weather, and repeat themselves in the dear  old set terms. That is why nature is more interesting than man, it never  repeats itself or displays an effect for more than a minute. Five men  out of any six on board, I believe, would make a fair copy of the  conversation of these two, but only one man who has lived in our times  could have made a fist at that effect of faint lamp-light and fainter  moonlight on the black of the coat against the deep blue-black of the  star spangled southern sky. Only the \"Master\" could have got the  delicacy and movement of the faintly sea-green veil that sometimes lifts  on the warm breeze and floats an instant across the sky and the  broadcloth; he would have got the innermost delicacy of colour form  purely and simply, without an inch, of conventional paint or catch-penny  sentiment.          CHAPTER VII      I believe this is the 5th. These 'chits' help one to remember dates;  they are little cards presented you when you order soda water or wine,  or are solicited for subscriptions to sports or sweepstakes. They have  the date marked on them, and you add your name, and number of berth, and  away goes your steward to the bar or wine man, and you get what you  ordered; it may be ages afterwards, when you have almost forgotten what  it was you ordered, but punctually at the end of the week, you get them  in a bundle and pay up. \"I find,\" to quote Carlyle again, \"I have a  considerable feeling of astonishment at the unexpected size of the  bundles. It's a most excellent system, and if there wasn't such a crowd  it would work out all right here.\"    It is uncomfortably warm now and damp. Last night we on the main deck  had to sleep with ports closed, so we had to live with very little air;  I do not know what the temperature was, not having a thermometer with  us, as we are almost amidship and near the engine, it must have been  considerable.    ... The Red Sea does not grow in my affections; as we go south there is  too much of the sensation of being slowly stewed. At Babel Mandeb I  believe the temperature of the sea rises to 100 deg. F.    The islands we pass on the shore to the east, distant about fifteen  miles as I write, are interesting enough. I suppose the inhabitants are  somewhat irresponsible, and were we to land there in the boats unarmed,  might find us full occupation for the rest of our lives as slaves in  the interior. There was a ship wrecked on this coast some years ago,  and her boat's crew landed, and were either killed or are up country  slaving. R. tells me the wife of one of them lives beside his people in  Fife, which makes us feel almost in touch with the sandy shore. What an  anomaly--a modern steamship packed with western civilisation reeling off  twenty knots an hour--past a desert land of lawless nomadic Arab tribes.    [Illustration]    As we get south nearer Aden the sand spits tail out south and slope off  inland like wide glaciers, through which appear dark coloured rocky  islets.    ... We had rather bad luck yesterday and to-day; the iron wind catcher  put out at our port to make a draught caught a sea, and threw it all  over our cabin. G.'s maid had just opened my overland trunk to give the  contents an airing, and now my collars are pulp and rose pink from the  lining of the collar box, so I must call on the barber who runs a shop  on board. We had the carpet taken up and our clothes hung up to dry, but  they won't, for the air is so hot and damp--with the least exertion you  steam! Imagine the joy of having to dress for dinner in such cramped  space and heat--you drop a stud and a year of your life in finding it! I  think most people realise that their feelings under these circumstances  cannot be exactly described in decorous language, so they set their  teeth in grim silence; and after all there is something laughable about  all the trouble--we needn't go in for white shirts and black coats and  trousers in the tropics unless we like. Everyone feels them horribly  uncomfortable and unsuitable, but no one dares to be so utterly radical  as come to dinner in anything else. If a flannel shirt and shorts were  the fashion, if only for the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, how many valued  lives would be prolonged. The penance in India is not so bad; there your  _Boy_ hunts your stud whilst you sit and cool.    A number of passengers sleep on deck now; I suppose three and four in a  cabin is intolerable. They have their mattresses brought up on deck by  their cabin steward, and he chalks their number on the deck at their  feet; you can thus sleep in a strong wet draught under the officers'  deck. There is a great deal of pleasure in sleeping in the open, but you  should have nothing but stars overhead and a shelter to windward, if it  is only a swelling in the ground or a sod or two. The ladies have a part  of the deck reserved, and the floor of the music room round the well  that opens into the dining-saloon below. Their part of the deck is  defended at night by a zereba of deck chairs, piled three or four feet  high; it suggests privacy!    We had our port open last night again--my fault--and just as G. came to  my end of the cabin to tell me the waves were getting near the port, in  one came! So we spent the small hot hours rearranging things, shut the  port and slept the sleep of the weary, and awakened more dead than alive  from too little air and too much water.    Yesterday the ship went on fire. It started on the woodwork of the  companion way, where there was a place for stationery; there was a  mighty mess of water and smell of smoke and a panel or two burned, and  no great damage done, as far as I can hear. I am surprised we don't go  on fire every day with so many smokers chucking cigarette ends  overboard. The wind-catchers sticking out of the ports of course catch  these, and they blow into the berths. Yesterday, however, to prevent  this, two or three buckets with sand in them were put down on deck in  which cigarette ends are to be buried and pipes knocked out, so there's  a chance for us all yet!    This morning I made a water-colour for my engineer friend, as a return  for the wine vase he gave me. I thought he'd like a sketch of a Highland  burn in spate--thought it would be cooling. How it came about I cannot  explain, but I did him a recollection of a burn within five to seven  miles, by sea, of his birthplace in Jura! I'd put him down as coming  from the Clyde.    The biggest event for me in this day's reckoning was the discovery that  the distinguished judge I observed contemplating the blue waves for some  minutes, was an artist before he took to Law! You might have knocked me  down with a feather--five years in Lauren's studio in Paris, and three  pictures on the line the year he was called to the bar and two of them  sold! We had a great talk about art and all the rest of it. He and  Jacomb Hood and others were fellow students, and he and Jacomb Hood and  this writer, and various artists and newspaper men are to meet at his  board in Calcutta and have a right good Bohemian evening as in days of  yore.    Is it not curiously sanguine this belief, to which I've seen quite old  men clinging--that you can repeat a good time. It is possible we will  have a good evening, and talk lots of shop, for we all know far more  about it now, than we did then; but it was what we did not know, that  gave the charm to student days.    We talk art and technique pretty hard, but I can't quite get over the  shock--an artist--become a judge--A Quartier Latin Art Student--a Judge  of the High Court--with a fixed income, and on his way to Calcutta,  perhaps to hang folk!    We had sports to-day and a sing-song in the evening. The sports were  very amusing; the bolster fight on a spar doesn't sound interesting, but  it was; it got quite exciting towards the end as the wiry cavalry  colonel, hero of many a stricken field, knocked out all comers, young or  old. Egg and spoon races and threading needles were a little stupid, but  what tableaux the groups of fair women made, with the bright dresses  and complexions, and the jolly brown young men, all in the soft light  that was filtering through the awning and blazing up from under its edge  from the sea.    [Illustration]    Sunday--at Aden--loafed all morning--vowed I'd not paint--bustle and  movement too great--painted hard in afternoon--horribly difficult--too  many people--ladies skirt in palette--man's hoof in water tin--chucked  it.    [Illustration: Aden, and Fan-sellers]    This is verbatim from my log and expresses a very little of one's  feelings; everyone is so jolly and polite too, you just have to stop, or  go on and show temper. Two or three of the passengers tried to paint  effects, each formed a centre of a group of people, who looked over  their shoulders, the onlookers one after another remarking with  ingratiating smiles, \"You don't mind my looking, do you?\" Why on earth  do people look over the shoulders of persons painting, when they would  never dream of looking over the shoulder of any one writing?  Notwithstanding the crowd and polite requests to be \"allowed to look,\"  and the untenable effort required to give soft answers, I did manage to  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2276"],[0,"The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (#11)"],[1,"into Germany, he entered into the service of the Emperor Charles VI.  Many regretted that he was not taken, and made to suffer the penalty  due for such a crime, and the melancholy incident became a pulpit theme  over a great part of Scotland, being held up as a proper warning to  youth to beware of such haunts of vice and depravity, the nurses of all  that is precipitate, immoral, and base, among mankind.    After the funeral of this promising and excellent young man, his father  never more held up his head. Miss Logan, with all her art, could not  get him to attend to any worldly thing, or to make any settlement  whatsoever of his affairs, save making her over a present of what  disposable funds he had about him. As to his estates, when they were  mentioned to him, he wished them all in the bottom of the sea, and  himself along with them. But, whenever she mentioned the circumstance  of Thomas Drummond having been the murderer of his son, he shook his  head, and once made the remark that \"It was all a mistake, a gross and  fatal error; but that God, who had permitted such a flagrant deed,  would bring it to light in his own time and way.\" In a few weeks he  followed his son to the grave, and the notorious Robert Wringhim took  possession of his estates as the lawful son of the late laird, born in  wedlock, and under his father's roof. The investiture was celebrated by  prayer, singing of psalms, and religious disputation. The late guardian  and adopted father, and the mother of the new laird, presided on the  grand occasion, making a conspicuous figure in all the work of the day;  and, though the youth himself indulged rather more freely in the bottle  than he had ever been seen to do before, it was agreed by all present  that there had never been a festivity so sanctified within the great  hall of Dalcastle. Then, after due thanks returned, they parted  rejoicing in spirit; which thanks, by the by, consisted wholly in  telling the Almighty what he was; and informing, with very particular  precision, what they were who addressed him; for Wringhim's whole  system of popular declamation consisted, it seems, in this--to denounce  all men and women to destruction, and then hold out hopes to his  adherents that they were the chosen few, included in the promises, and  who could never fall away. It would appear that this pharisaical  doctrine is a very delicious one, and the most grateful of all others  to the worst characters.    But the ways of heaven are altogether inscrutable, and soar as far  above and beyond the works and the comprehensions of man as the sun,  flaming in majesty, is above the tiny boy's evening rocket. It is the  controller of Nature alone that can bring light out of darkness, and  order out of confusion. Who is he that causeth the mole, from his  secret path of darkness, to throw up the gem, the gold, and the  precious ore? The same that from the mouths of babes and sucklings can  extract the perfection of praise, and who can make the most abject of  his creatures instrumental in bringing the most hidden truths to light.    Miss Logan had never lost the thought of her late master's prediction  that Heaven would bring to light the truth concerning the untimely  death of his son. She perceived that some strange conviction, too  horrible for expression, preyed on his mind from the moment that the  fatal news reached him to the last of his existence; and, in his last  ravings, he uttered some incoherent words about justification by faith  alone and absolute and eternal predestination having been the ruin of  his house. These, to be sure, were the words of superannuation, and of  the last and severest kind of it; but, for all that, they sunk deep  into Miss Logan's soul, and at last she began to think with herself:  \"Is it possible the Wringhims, and the sophisticating wretch who is in  conjunction with them, the mother of my late beautiful and amiable  young master, can have effected his destruction? If so, I will spend my  days, and my little patrimony, in endeavours to rake up and expose the  unnatural deed.\"    In all her outgoings and incomings Mrs. Logan (as she was now styled)  never lost sight of this one object. Every new disappointment only  whetted her desire to fish up some particulars, concerning it; for she  thought so long and so ardently upon it that by degrees it became  settled in her mind as a sealed truth. And, as woman is always most  jealous of her own sex in such matters, her suspicions were fixed on  her greatest enemy, Mrs. Colwan, now the Lady Dowager of Dalcastle. All  was wrapt in a chaos of confusion and darkness; but at last, by dint of  a thousand sly and secret inquiries, Mrs. Logan found out where Lady  Dalcastle had been on the night that the murder happened, and likewise  what company she had kept, as well as some of the comers and goers; and  she had hopes of having discovered a clue, which, if she could keep  hold of the thread, would lead her through darkness to the light of  truth.    Returning very late one evening from a convocation of family servants,  which she had drawn together in order to fish something out of them,  her maid having been in attendance on her all the evening, they found,  on going home, that the house had been broken and a number of valuable  articles stolen therefrom. Mrs. Logan had grown quite heartless before  this stroke, having been altogether unsuccessful in her inquiries, and  now she began to entertain some resolutions of giving up the fruitless  search.    In a few days thereafter, she received intelligence that her clothes  and plate were mostly recovered, and that she for one was bound over to  prosecute the depredator, provided the articles turned out to be hers,  as libelled in the indictment, and as a king's evidence had given out.  She was likewise summoned, or requested, I know not which, being  ignorant of these matters, to go as far as the town of Peebles in  Tweedside, in order to survey these articles on such a day, and make  affidavit to their identity before the Sheriff She went accordingly;  but, on entering the town by the North Gate, she was accosted by a poor  girl in tattered apparel, who with great earnestness inquired if her  name was not Mrs. Logan? On being answered in the affirmative, she said  that the unfortunate prisoner in the Tolbooth requested her, as she  valued all that was dear to her in life, to go and see her before she  appeared in court at the hour of cause, as she (the prisoner) had  something of the greatest moment to impart to her. Mrs. Logan's  curiosity was excited, and she followed the girl straight to the  Tolbooth, who by the way said to her that she would find in the  prisoner a woman of superior mind, who had gone through all the  vicissitudes of life. \"She has been very unfortunate, and I fear very  wicked,\" added the poor thing, \"but she is my mother, and God knows,  with all her faults and failings, she has never been unkind to me. You,  madam, have it in your power to save her; but she has wronged you, and  therefore, if you will not do it for her sake, do it for mine, and the  God of the fatherless will reward you.\"    Mrs. Logan answered her with a cast of the head, and a hem! and only  remarked, that \"the guilty must not always be suffered to escape, or  what a world must we be doomed to live in!\"    She was admitted to the prison, and found a tall emaciated figure, who  appeared to have once possessed a sort of masculine beauty in no  ordinary degree, but was now considerably advanced in years. She viewed  Mrs. Logan with a stem, steady gaze, as if reading her features as a  margin to her intellect; and when she addressed her it was not with  that humility, and agonized fervour, which are natural for one in such  circumstances to address to another who has the power of her life and  death in her hands.    \"I am deeply indebted to you for this timely visit, Mrs. Logan,\" said  she. \"It is not that I value life, or because I fear death, that I have  sent for you so expressly. But the manner of the death that awaits me  has something peculiarly revolting in it to a female mind. Good God!  when I think of being hung up, a spectacle to a gazing, gaping  multitude, with numbers of which I have had intimacies and connections,  that would render the moment of parting so hideous, that, believe me,  it rends to flinders a soul born for another sphere than that in which  it has moved, had not the vile selfishness of a lordly fiend ruined all  my prospects and all my hopes. Hear me then; for I do not ask your  pity: I only ask of you to look to yourself, and behave with womanly  prudence, if you deny this day that these goods are yours, there is no  other evidence whatever against my life, and it is safe for the  present. For, as for the word of the wretch who has betrayed me, it is  of no avail; he has prevaricated so notoriously to save himself. If you  deny them, you shall have them all again to the value of a mite, and  more to the bargain. If you swear to the identity of them, the process  will, one way and another, cost you the half of what they are worth.\"    \"And what security have I for that?\" said Mrs. Logan.    \"You have none but my word,\" said the other proudly, \"and that never  yet was violated. If you cannot take that, I know the worst you can do.  But I had forgot--I have a poor helpless child without, waiting and  starving about the prison door. Surely it was of her that I wished to  speak. This shameful death of mine will leave her in a deplorable  state.\"    \"The girl seems to have candour and strong affections,\" said Mrs.  Logan. \"I grievously mistake if such a child would not be a thousand  times better without such a guardian and director.\"    \"Then will you be so kind as to come to the Grass Market and see me put  down?\" said the prisoner. \"I thought a woman would estimate a woman's  and a mother's feelings, when such a dreadful throw was at stake, at"]]]
