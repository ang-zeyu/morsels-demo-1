Your mother and I  differ entirely on the subject. She believes that Reuben Whitney is  guilty. I am absolutely convinced he is innocent. Therefore, if you  please, we will not discuss it.\"    The following morning Kate Ellison went down to the school house.    \"Mr. Shrewsbury,\" she said, putting her head in at the door, \"could  you come out for two or three minutes? I want particularly to speak  to you.    \"Have you heard what took place yesterday, at Lewes?\" she asked  when he came out.    \"Yes, Miss Ellison. I saw Jones the constable last night, and he  told me all that had been said in court.\"    \"And you think Reuben Whitney is innocent?\" she asked eagerly.    \"I am quite sure of it, Miss Ellison--as sure as I am of my own  existence. For anyone who knows him to have a doubt is absolutely  absurd. A finer young fellow than Reuben it would be hard to find.\"    \"But what did he say? How did he account for his tools being found  there?\"    The schoolmaster repeated the account Reuben had given, and said:    \"When the trial comes off I shall, of course, go over; and testify  both as to his general conduct and to the fact that he had, as he  said, promised to bring over his tools to put up some shelves in my  cupboards.\"    \"Do you think he will get off, Mr. Shrewsbury?\" she asked  anxiously.    \"I should hope so, Miss Ellison, but I can't disguise from myself  that it is by no means certain. That unfortunate old business about  the dog will tell terribly against him; and though I am perfectly  sure that his account of what took place is correct, there is  nothing to confirm it. It is just the sort of story, they will say,  that he would naturally get up to account for his absence, and for  the tools being found. Of course, if the jury knew him as well as I  do the result would be certain; but I have been trying to look at  the facts as if he were a stranger, and I can't say what decision I  should come to, in such a case. Still, of course, the high  character that will be given him, and the fact that there is no  evidence whatever connecting him, in any way, with bad characters,  must count immensely in his favour.\"    The assizes were to take place only a fortnight after the date of  Reuben's committal. Mrs. Whitney had engaged a lawyer in the town  to defend her son and, to the surprise of this gentleman, Mr.  Ellison called upon him two or three days later, and said:    \"Mr. Brogden, I hear that you have been engaged by Mrs. Whitney to  defend her son. I don't believe the young fellow is guilty, and  therefore I authorize you to spend any sum that may be necessary in  getting up his defence; and I wish you to instruct a counsel to  appear for him. Of course I cannot appear openly in the matter, and  my name must not be mentioned, but I will guarantee all expenses.    \"It seems to me that it would be desirable to find out, if  possible, the village where he says he breakfasted, and asked the  way to Lewes. In his story he says he didn't know the name of the  village but, as he was told it was about twenty miles from Lewes,  and he can describe the road he followed, there ought to be no  difficulty in finding it.    \"I should advise you to have a chat with Shrewsbury, the  schoolmaster at Tipping. He is a great friend of the lad's, and a  very intelligent fellow. He may be able to suggest some points to  be followed up. At any rate, do all you can.\"    Reuben had another adherent who was also acting on his behalf. The  afternoon before the trial, Kate Ellison stopped before the  blacksmith shop in the village and, seeing that Jacob Priestley the  smith was at work, alone, she entered.    \"Is it true, Jacob, that you have been summoned on the jury at  Lewes tomorrow?\"    \"Yes, miss, it bee true, sureley. It be four years since anyone in  the village was summoned, and it be mighty hard that they should  have picked upon me. Still, I have never been called before, so I  suppose I mustn't grumble; but it be hard to be taken away from  work, to waste one's time in a court, and they say the 'sizes ull  last for three days.\"    \"Well, Jacob, you know that Reuben Whitney is going to be tried for  robbery at our house.\"    \"Yes, miss; so they says.\"    \"Well, what do you think about it, Jacob?\"    \"I don't think nothing one way or the other, miss. Most folks says  as how he must have done it, 'cause as how he poisoned squire's dog  afore.\"    \"He didn't do anything of the sort, Jacob; and it's very wicked of  people to say so. He is innocent, quite innocent. I am sure he is,  and papa is quite sure, too; and he will be terribly put out if he  is found guilty. So I want you to promise me that, whatever the  others think, you will hold out that he is innocent.\"    \"Well, miss,\" the smith said, scratching his head, \"if you be sure  of it, and squire be sure, I suppose there can't be no doubt about  it, for who should know better than squire; and I am sure I  wouldn't go to put him about, for a better landlord than squire  ain't to be found in the county. So you tell him, miss, as I will  hold out.\"    \"But papa doesn't know that I have come down here, Jacob. It  wouldn't do for him to interfere, you know; especially as he is a  magistrate himself. You mustn't mention to anyone that I have  spoken to you about it--not to anyone, Jacob, not even to your  wife--but I can tell you the squire will be heartily pleased if he  is found innocent, and he will be terribly put out if he is found  guilty.\"    \"All right, miss,\" the smith replied. \"I understand, and no one  sha'n't know as you have spoken to me aboot it. It be quite enough  for I to know as the squire knows as he's innocent. It ain't likely  as I should stick my opinion up against his.\"    The day after he heard of Reuben's arrest, the schoolmaster went  over to see him; and as he was the bearer of a letter from Mr.  Ellison to the governor of the jail, he was able to obtain  admittance.    \"Was there ever such an unfortunate fellow as I am?\" Reuben  exclaimed, after the first hearty greeting. \"Here am I for the  second time accused of a crime of which I am innocent; and from  which, indeed, in the present case I am a sufferer; and all this  has come about, simply because I went out of my way to inquire into  what seemed to me a suspicious business.\"    \"Tell me all about it, Reuben. I have heard the statement you made  to the chief constable; but tell it me again, with every detail you  can think of. Some circumstance, which appears to you as trifling,  may furnish a clue.\"    \"I have seen Mr. Brogden, the lawyer. I have told him all that  happened,\" Reuben said; \"but of course, I will gladly tell you  again.\"    And Reuben repeated the story of the adventure, with every detail  that he could think of; speaking slowly, as the schoolmaster wrote  it down at length.    \"I will see what I can make of it, when I think it over,\" Mr.  Shrewsbury said. \"Of course, as it stands, it is so natural and  probable that it would clear you at once; had it not been for that  unfortunate dog business before, and the supposition, excited by  it, that you had a feeling of hostility to the squire. I shall be  able partly to dispose of that, for I can swear that you have  frequently spoken to me of the squire in tones of respect and  liking; and that, although you regretted the manner in which you  left his service, you felt no ill will against him on account of  it. Moreover, I shall be able to prove that the reasons you gave  for having your tools with you was a true one; and although I  cannot swear that I expected you specially on that evening, the  fact that you were in the habit of coming over, at times, to see  me, cannot but corroborate your story.    \"I shall get leave for two or three days, and will hunt up the  village where you breakfasted.\"    \"Thank you very much,\" Reuben said, \"though I have been thinking it  over, and do not see that the evidence of the people at the public  house would help me much. It will simply prove that I passed  through there in the morning; but will not show, in any way,  whether I went willingly as far as that, as one of the party who  broke into the house, or whether I was taken there.\"    \"They can probably prove that you looked pale and exhausted,\" the  schoolmaster said.    \"I fancy I should look pale, in any case,\" Reuben said, \"if I had  gone through such a night's work as that of breaking into the  squire's.\"    \"Well, keep up your courage, Reuben. You may be quite sure that  your friends will do all in their power for you. I shall go now and  have a chat with your mother. I am afraid that she will want  comforting more than you do.\"    \"Yes,\" Reuben agreed, \"I am afraid so. Somehow I don't seem to take  it to heart much. I shall feel it more afterwards, perhaps; but at  present, the whole thing seems so extraordinary that I can't quite  realize that I am in danger of being sent to Botany Bay. The worst  of it is that, even if I am acquitted, lots of people will still  think I am guilty. There is only one thing that can really prove my  innocence, and that is the arrest of Tom Thorne, and his father.\"    \"I hear,\" the schoolmaster said, \"that the chief constable has  written up to Bow Street, for them to put the runners on the traces  of those two scoundrels. Whether they believe your story or not, it  is quite evident that more than one person was concerned in the  affair. Their theory, of course, is that you quarrelled with the  others over the division of the spoil; and got that knock on the  head, which is a very severe one. I went down yesterday with Jones,  to see the spot where you said you were assaulted. There were marks  where the horse stopped, and marks of feet in the field, and a  patch of blood; all of which goes to prove that your story may be  true, but unfortunately it doesn't prove that it was because,  according to the theory against you, you might have been assaulted  after"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#11)"],[1,"faint.    Then he glanced fearfully and covertly at his fiancee. _She_ must not  know the truth at any cost. Possibly he lost his head! At all events,  that is the kindest construction to put on his subsequent action,  for, dastardly as his behaviour had been to Jean in the past, one can  hardly imagine him capable of deliberately murdering her, and in so  horrible a fashion. There was not a second to lose; an instant more,  and the secret, that he had so assiduously hidden from the lady beside  him, would be revealed. Jean's mouth was already open to speak. He  waved her aside. She adhered to her post. He shouted to the postilion,  and the huge, lumbering vehicle was set in motion. At the first turn  of the wheels, Jean slipped from her perch, her dress caught in the  spokes, and she was crushed to death.    Her fate does not appear to have made any deep impression either on  Mr. Stuart or his lady-love, for they continued their drive.    The hauntings began that autumn. Mr. Stuart, as was only fit and  proper, being the first to witness the phenomenon. Returning home from  a drive one evening, he perceived to his surprise the dark outlines of  a human figure perched on the arched gateway of his house, exactly  opposite the spot where Jean had perished. Wondering who it could be,  he leaned forward to inspect it closer. The figure moved, an icy  current of air ran through him, and he saw to his horror the livid  countenance of the dead Jean. There she was, staring down at him with  lurid, glassy eyes; her cheeks startlingly white, her hair fluttering  in the wind, her neck and forehead bathed in blood.    Paralysed with terror, Mr. Stuart could not remove his gaze, and it  was not until one of the menials opened the carriage door to assist  him down, that the spell was broken and he was able to speak and move.  He then flew into the house, and spent the rest of the night in the  most abject fear.    After this he had no peace--Allanbank was constantly haunted. The  great oak doors opened and shut of their own accord at night with loud  clanging and bangs, and the rustling of silks and pattering of  high-heeled shoes were heard in the oak-panelled bedrooms and along  the many dark and winding passages.    From her attire, which was a piece of lace made of thread, the  apparition became known as \"Pearlin' Jean,\" and a portrait of her was  actually painted. It is recorded that when this picture was hung  between one of Mr. Stuart and his lady-love, the hauntings ceased, but  that as soon as it was removed they were renewed. Presumably, it was  not allowed to remain in the aforesaid position long, for the  manifestations appear to have gone on for many years without  intermission.    Most phantasms of the dead inspire those who see them with  horror,--and that is my own experience,--but \"Pearlin' Jean\" seems to  have been an exception to this rule. A housekeeper called Betty  Norrie, who lived for many years at Allanbank, declared that other  people besides herself had so frequently seen Jean that they had grown  quite accustomed to her, and were, consequently, no more alarmed at  her appearance than they were by her noises.    Another servant at the house, of the name of Jenny Blackadder, used  constantly to hear Jean, but could never see her--though her husband  did.    The latter, when courting Jenny, received a rare scare, which suggests  to me that Jean, in spite of her tragic ending, may not have been  without a spice of humour. Thomas, for that was the swain's name,  made an assignation one night to meet Jenny in the orchard at  Allanbank.    It was early when he arrived at the trysting-place--for Thomas, like  all true lovers, was ever rather more than punctual--and he fully  contemplated a long wait. Judge, then, of his astonishment, when he  perceived in the moonlight what he took to be the well-known and  adored figure of his lady-love. With a cry of delight, Thomas rushed  forward, and, swinging his arms widely open to embrace her, beheld her  vanish, and found himself hugging space! An icy current of air  thrilled through him, and the whole place--trees, nooks, moonbeams,  and shadows, underwent a hideous metamorphosis. The very air bristled  with unknown horrors till flesh and blood could stand no more, and,  even at the risk of displeasing his beloved Jenny, Thomas fled! Some  few minutes later, at the appointed hour, Jenny arrived on the scene,  and no one was there. She dallied for some time, wondering whatever  could have happened to Thomas, and then returned, full of grave  apprehensions, to the house.    It was not until the next morning that the truth leaked out, and  Jenny, after indulging in a hearty laugh at her lover, who felt very  shamefaced now that it was daylight, sensibly forgave him, and raised  no obstacle when asked to fix a day for their marriage.    In after years, Jenny used to retail the story with many harrowing  allusions to \"Pearlin' Jean,\" whom she somewhat foolishly made use of  as a bogey to frighten children into being good. A Mr. Sharpe, who  when he was a little boy was once placed in her charge, confesses that  he was dreadfully scared at her stories, and that he never ventured  down a passage in those days without thinking \"Pearlin' Jean,\" with  her ghostly, blood-stained face, clawlike hands, and rustling lace  dress, was after him.    Nurse Jenny used to tell him that the Stuarts tried in vain to lay  Jean's spirit, actually going to the length of calling in seven  ministers to exorcise it. But all to no purpose; it still continued  its nocturnal peregrinations.    In the year 1790 the Stuarts let the house to strangers, who, when  they took it, had not the least idea that it was haunted. However,  they did not long remain in ignorance, for two ladies, who occupied  the same bedroom, were awakened in the night by hearing some one  walking across the floor. The \"presence\" did not suggest burglars, for  the intruder behaved in the most noisy manner, pacing restlessly and  apparently aimlessly backwards and forwards across the room, swishing  the floor (with what sounded like a long lace train) and breathing  heavily. They were both terrified, and so cold that they could hear  one another's teeth chatter. They were too frightened to call for  help; they could only lie still, hoping and praying it would not come  nearer to them. The sufferings of these two ladies were indescribable,  for the ghost remained in their room all night, moving restlessly  about until daybreak. It was not until some days later, when other  people in the house had experienced the phenomenon, that they were  told the story of the notorious \"Pearlin' Jean.\"    But was the so-called \"Pearlin' Jean\" really the apparition of the  murdered French woman? To my mind, her identity with that of the  beautiful Sister of Charity has not been satisfactorily established,  and I think there are reasons to doubt it.    If, for instance, the apparition were that of a Sister of Charity, why  should it appear incongruously attired in a long trailing gown of  lace? And if it were that of a woman of the presumably staid habits of  a Sister of Charity, why should it delight in mischief and play the  pranks of a _poltergeist_? And yet if it wasn't the ghost of Jean,  whose ghost was it?                                  CASE VIII        THE DRUMMER OF CORTACHY      What ancient Scottish or Irish family has not its Family Ghost? A  banshee--the heritage of Niall of the Nine Hostages--is still the  unenviable possession of his descendants, the O'Donnells, and I, who  am a member of the clan, have both seen and heard it several times. As  it appears to me, it resembles the decapitated head of a prehistoric  woman, and I shall never forget my feelings one night, when, aroused  from slumber by its ghastly wailing, I stumbled frantically out of  bed, and, groping my way upstairs in the dark, without venturing to  look to the left or right lest I should see something horrible, found  every inmate of the house huddled together on the landing, paralysed  with fear. I did not see it on that occasion, but on the following  morning, as I had anticipated, I received the news that a near and  dear relative had died.    Possessing such an heirloom myself, I can therefore readily sympathise  with those who own a similar treasure--such, for example, as the  famous, or rather infamous, Drummer of Cortachy Castle, who is  invariably heard beating a tattoo before the death of a member of the  clan of Ogilvie.    Mrs. Crowe, in her _Night Side of Nature_, referring to the haunting,  says:--    \"Miss D., a relative of the present Lady C., who had been staying some  time with the Earl and Countess at their seat, near Dundee, was  invited to spend a few days at Cortachy Castle, with the Earl and  Countess of Airlie. She went, and whilst she was dressing for dinner  the first evening of her arrival, she heard a strain of music under  her window, which finally resolved itself into a well-defined sound of  a drum. When her maid came upstairs, she made some inquiries about the  drummer that was playing near the house; but the maid knew nothing on  the subject. For the moment the circumstance passed from Miss D.'s  mind, but, recurring to her again during the dinner, she said,  addressing Lord Airlie, 'My lord, who is your drummer?' Upon which his  lordship turned pale, Lady Airlie looked distressed, and several of  the company, who all heard the question, embarrassed; whilst the lady,  perceiving that she had made some unpleasant allusion, although she  knew not to what their feelings referred, forebore further inquiry  till she reached the drawing-room; when, having mentioned the  circumstance again to a member of the family, she was answered, 'What,  have you never heard of the drummer boy?' 'No,' replied Miss D.; 'who  in the world is he?' 'Why,' replied the other, 'he is a person who  goes about the house playing his drum, whenever"]]]
