The  Paris museum, however, possesses a good many of the Lamarckian types,  which are on exhibition (Perrier, _l. c._, p. 20).    [39] _Lettre du Ministre des Finances (de Ramel) au Ministre de  l'Interieur_ (13 pr. an V.). See Perrier, _l. c._, p. 20.          CHAPTER V    LAST DAYS AND DEATH      Lamarck's life was saddened and embittered by the loss of four wives,  and the pangs of losing three of his children;[40] also by the rigid  economy he had to practise and the unending poverty of his whole  existence. A very heavy blow to him and to science was the loss, at an  advanced age, of his eyesight.    It was, apparently, not a sudden attack of blindness, for we have hints  that at times he had to call in Latreille and others to aid him in the  study of the insects. The continuous use of the magnifying lens and the  microscope, probably, was the cause of enfeebled eyesight, resulting in  complete loss of vision. Duval[41] states that he passed the last ten  years of his life in darkness; that his loss of sight gradually came on  until he became completely blind.    In the reports of the meetings of the Board of Professors there is but  one reference to his blindness. Previous to this we find that, at his  last appearance at these sessions--_i.e._, April 19, 1825--since his  condition did not permit him to give his course of lectures, he had  asked M. Latreille to fill his place; but such was the latter's health,  he proposed that M. Audouin, sub-librarian of the French Institute,  should lecture in his stead, on the invertebrate animals. This was  agreed to.    The next reference, and the only explicit one, is that in the records  for May 23, 1826, as follows: \"Vu la cecite dont M. de Lamarck est  frappe, M. Bosc[42] continuera d'exercer sur les parties confiert a  M. Audouin la surveillance attribuee au Professeur.\"    But, according to Duval, long before this he had been unable to use his  eyes. In his _Systeme analytique des Connaissances positives de  l'Homme_, published in 1820, he refers to the sudden loss of his  eyesight.    Even in advanced life Lamarck seems not to have suffered from  ill-health, despite the fact that he apparently during the last thirty  years of his life lived in a very secluded way. Whether he went out into  the world, to the theatre, or even went away from Paris and the Museum  into the country in his later years, is a matter of doubt. It is said  that he was fond of novels, his daughters reading to him those of the  best French authors. After looking with some care through the records of  the sessions of the Assembly of Professors, we are struck with the  evidences of his devotion to routine museum work and to his courses of  lectures.    At that time the Museum sent out to the _Ecoles centrales_ of the  different departments of France named collections made up from the  duplicates, and in this sort of drudgery Lamarck took an active part. He  also took a prominent share in the business of the Museum, in the  exchange and in the purchase of specimens and collections in his  department, and even in the management of the menagerie. Thus he  reported on the dentition of the young lions (one dying from teething),  on the illness and recovery of one of the elephants, on the generations  of goats and kids in the park; also on a small-sized bull born of a  small cow covered by a Scottish bull, the young animal having, as he  states, all the characters of the original.    For one year (1794) he was secretary of the Board of Professors of the  Museum.[43] The records of the meetings from 4 vendemiaire, l'an III.,  until 4 vendemiaire, l'an IV., are each written in his bold, legible  handwriting or signed by him. He signed his name _Lamarck_, this period  being that of the first republic. Afterwards, in the records, his name  is written _De Lamarck_. He was succeeded by E. Geoffroy St. Hilaire,  who signed himself plain _Geoffroy_.    In 1802 he acted as treasurer of the Assembly, and again for a period of  six years, until and including 1811, when he resigned, the reason given  being: \"Il s'occupe depuis six ans et que ses travaux et son age lui  rendent penibles.\"    Lamarck was extremely regular in his attendance at these meetings. From  1793 until 1818 he rarely, if ever, missed a meeting. We have only  observed in the records of this long period the absence of his name on  two or three occasions from the list of those present. During 1818 and  the following year it was his blindness which probably prevented his  regular attendance. July 15, 1818, he was present, and presented the  fifth volume of his _Animaux sans Vertebres_; and August 31, 1819, he  was present[44] and laid before the Assembly the sixth volume of the  same great work.    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF LAMARCK, WHEN OLD AND BLIND, IN THE COSTUME  OF A MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE, ENGRAVED IN 1824.]    From the observations of the records we infer that Lamarck never had  any long, lingering illness or suffered from overwork, though his life  had little sunshine or playtime in it. He must have had a strong  constitution, his only infirmity being the terrible one (especially to  an observer of nature) of total blindness.    Lamarck's greatest work in systematic zooelogy would never have been  completed had it not been for the self-sacrificing spirit and devotion  of his eldest daughter.    A part of the sixth and the whole of the last volume of the _Animaux  sans Vertebres_ were presented to the Assembly of Professors  September 10, 1822. This volume was dictated to and written out by one  of his daughters, Mlle. Cornelie De Lamarck. On her the aged savant  leaned during the last ten years of his life--those years of failing  strength and of blindness finally becoming total. The frail woman  accompanied him in his hours of exercise, and when he was confined to  his house she never left him. It is stated by Cuvier, in his eulogy,  that at her first walk out of doors after the end came she was nearly  overcome by the fresh air, to which she had become so unaccustomed. She,  indeed, practically sacrificed her life to her father. It is one of the  rarest and most striking instances of filial devotion known in the  annals of science or literature, and is a noticeable contrast to the  daughters of the blind Milton, whose domestic life was rendered unhappy  by their undutifulness, as they were impatient of the restraint and  labors his blindness had imposed upon them.    Besides this, the seventh volume is a voluminous scientific work, filled  with very dry special details, making the labor of writing out from  dictation, of corrections and preparation for the press, most wearisome  and exhausting, to say nothing of the corrections of the proof-sheets, a  task which probably fell to her--work enough to break down the health of  a strong man.    It was a natural and becoming thing for the Assembly of Professors of  the Museum, in view of the \"malheureuse position de la famille,\" to vote  to give her employment in the botanical laboratory in arranging and  pasting the dried plants, with a salary of 1,000 francs.    Of the last illness of Lamarck, and the nature of the sickness to which  he finally succumbed, there is no account. It is probable that,  enfeebled by the weakness of extreme old age, he gradually sank away  without suffering from any acute disease.    The exact date of his death has been ascertained by Dr. Mondiere,[45]  with the aid of M. Saint-Joanny, archiviste du Department de la Seine,  who made special search for the record. The \"acte\" states that  December 28, 1829, Lamarck, then a widower, died in the Jardin du Roi,  at the age of eighty-five years.    The obsequies, as stated in the _Moniteur Universel_ of Paris for  December 23, 1829, were celebrated on the Sunday previous in the Church  of Saint-Medard, his parish. From the church the remains were borne to  the cemetery of Montparnasse. At the interment, which took place  December 30, M. Latreille, in the name of the Academy of Sciences, and  M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, in the name and on behalf of his colleagues,  the Professors of the Museum of Natural History, pronounced eulogies at  the grave. The eulogy prepared by Cuvier, and published after his death,  was read at a session of the Academy of Sciences, by Baron Silvestre,  November 26, 1832.    With the exception of these formalities, the great French naturalist,  \"the Linne of France,\" was buried as one forgotten and unknown. We read  with astonishment, in the account by Dr. A. Mondiere, who made zealous  inquiries for the exact site of the grave of Lamarck, that it is and  forever will be unknown. It is a sad and discreditable, and to us  inexplicable, fact that his remains did not receive decent burial. They  were not even deposited in a separate grave, but were thrown into a  trench apparently situated apart from the other graves, and from which  the bones of those thrown there were removed every five years. They are  probably now in the catacombs of Paris, mingled with those of the  thousands of unknown or paupers in that great ossuary.[46]    Dr. Mondiere's account is as follows. Having found in the _Moniteur_ the  notice of the burial services, as above stated, he goes on to say:      \"Armed with this document, I went again to the cemetery of    Montparnasse, where I fortunately found a conservator, M. Lacave,    who is entirely _au courant_ with the question of transformism. He    therefore interested himself in my inquiries, and, thanks to him, I    have been able to determine exactly where Lamarck had been buried. I    say had been, because, alas! he had been simply placed in a _trench    off on one side_ (_fosse a part_), that is to say, one which should    change its occupant at the end of five years. Was it negligence, was    it the jealousy of his colleagues, was it the result of the troubles    of 1830? In brief, there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2057"],[0,"The Last of the Plainsmen (#11)"],[1," I can tell whether to call then back or not.\"    The sun was gilding the rim of the desert rampart when we began the  ascent of the foothills of Buckskin. A steep trail wound zigzag up the  mountain We led our horses, as it was a long, hard climb. From time to  time, as I stopped to catch my breath I gazed away across the growing  void to the gorgeous Pink Cliffs, far above and beyond the red wall  which had seemed so high, and then out toward the desert. The irregular  ragged crack in the plain, apparently only a thread of broken ground,  was the Grand Canyon. How unutterably remote, wild, grand was that  world of red and brown, of purple pall, of vague outline!    Two thousand feet, probably, we mounted to what Frank called Little  Buckskin. In the west a copper glow, ridged with lead-colored clouds,  marked where the sun had set. The air was very thin and icy cold. At  the first clump of pinyon pines, we made dry camp. When I sat down it  was as if I had been anchored. Frank solicitously remarked that I  looked \"sort of beat.\" Jim built a roaring fire and began getting  supper. A snow squall came on the rushing wind. The air grew colder,  and though I hugged the fire, I could not get warm. When I had  satisfied my hunger, I rolled out my sleeping-bag and crept into it. I  stretched my aching limbs and did not move again. Once I awoke,  drowsily feeling the warmth of the fire, and I heard Frank say: \"He's  asleep, dead to the world!\"    \"He's all in,\" said Jones. \"Riding's what did it You know how a horse  tears a man to pieces.\"    \"Will he be able to stand it?\" asked Frank, with as much solicitude as  if he were my brother. \"When you get out after anythin'--well, you're  hell. An' think of the country we're goin' into. I know you've never  seen the breaks of the Siwash, but I have, an' it's the worst an'  roughest country I ever saw. Breaks after breaks, like the ridges on a  washboard, headin' on the south slope of Buckskin, an' runnin' down,  side by side, miles an' miles, deeper an' deeper, till they run into  that awful hole. It will be a killin' trip on men, horses an' dogs.  Now, Mr. Wallace, he's been campin' an' roughin' with the Navajos for  months; he's in some kind of shape, but--\"    Frank concluded his remark with a doubtful pause.    \"I'm some worried, too,\" replied Jones. \"But he would come. He stood  the desert well enough; even the Mormons said that.\"    In the ensuing silence the fire sputtered, the glare fitfully merged  into dark shadows under the weird pinyons, and the wind moaned through  the short branches.    \"Wal,\" drawled a slow, soft voice, \"shore I reckon you're hollerin' too  soon. Frank's measly trick puttin' him on Spot showed me. He rode out  on Spot, an' he rode in on Spot. Shore he'll stay.\"    It was not all the warmth of the blankets that glowed over me then. The  voices died away dreamily, and my eyelids dropped sleepily tight. Late  in the night I sat up suddenly, roused by some unusual disturbance. The  fire was dead; the wind swept with a rush through the pinyons. From the  black darkness came the staccato chorus of coyotes. Don barked his  displeasure; Sounder made the welkin ring, and old Moze growled low and  deep, grumbling like muttered thunder. Then all was quiet, and I slept.    Dawn, rosy red, confronted me when I opened my eyes. Breakfast was  ready; Frank was packing Old Baldy; Jones talked to his horse as he  saddled him; Wallace came stooping his giant figure under the pinyons;  the dogs, eager and soft-eyed, sat around Jim and begged. The sun  peeped over the Pink Cliffs; the desert still lay asleep, tranced in a  purple and golden-streaked mist.    \"Come, come!\" said Jones, in his big voice. \"We're slow; here's the  sun.\"    \"Easy, easy,\" replied Frank, \"we've all the time there is.\"    When Frank threw the saddle over Satan I interrupted him and said I  would care for my horse henceforward. Soon we were under way, the  horses fresh, the dogs scenting the keen, cold air.    The trail rolled over the ridges of pinyon and scrubby pine.  Occasionally we could see the black, ragged crest of Buckskin above us.  From one of these ridges I took my last long look back at the desert,  and engraved on my mind a picture of the red wall, and the many-hued  ocean of sand. The trail, narrow and indistinct, mounted the last  slow-rising slope; the pinyons failed, and the scrubby pines became  abundant. At length we reached the top, and entered the great arched  aisles of Buckskin Forest. The ground was flat as a table. Magnificent  pine trees, far apart, with branches high and spreading, gave the eye  glad welcome. Some of these monarchs were eight feet thick at the base  and two hundred feet high. Here and there one lay, gaunt and prostrate,  a victim of the wind. The smell of pitch pine was sweetly overpowering.    \"When I went through here two weeks ago, the snow was a foot deep, an'  I bogged in places,\" said Frank. \"The sun has been oozin' round here  some. I'm afraid Jones won't find any snow on this end of Buckskin.\"    Thirty miles of winding trail, brown and springy from its thick mat of  pine needles, shaded always by the massive, seamy-barked trees, took us  over the extremity of Buckskin. Then we faced down into the head of a  ravine that ever grew deeper, stonier and rougher. I shifted from side  to side, from leg to leg in my saddle, dismounted and hobbled before  Satan, mounted again, and rode on. Jones called the dogs and complained  to them of the lack of snow. Wallace sat his horse comfortably, taking  long pulls at his pipe and long gazes at the shaggy sides of the  ravine. Frank, energetic and tireless, kept the pack-horses in the  trail. Jim jogged on silently. And so we rode down to Oak Spring.    The spring was pleasantly situated in a grove of oaks and Pinyons,  under the shadow of three cliffs. Three ravines opened here into an  oval valley. A rude cabin of rough-hewn logs stood near the spring.    \"Get down, get down,\" sang out Frank. \"We'll hang up here. Beyond Oak  is No-Man's-Land. We take our chances on water after we leave here.\"    When we had unsaddled, unpacked, and got a fire roaring on the wide  stone hearth of the cabin, it was once again night.    \"Boys,\" said Jones after supper, \"we're now on the edge of the lion  country. Frank saw lion sign in here only two weeks ago; and though the  snow is gone, we stand a show of finding tracks in the sand and dust.  To-morrow morning, before the sun gets a chance at the bottom of these  ravines, we'll be up and doing. We'll each take a dog and search in  different directions. Keep the dog in leash, and when he opens up,  examine the ground carefully for tracks. If a dog opens on any track  that you are sure isn't lion's, punish him. And when a lion-track is  found, hold the dog in, wait and signal. We'll use a signal I have  tried and found far-reaching and easy to yell. Waa-hoo! That's it. Once  yelled it means come. Twice means comes quickly. Three times means  come--danger!\"    In one corner of the cabin was a platform of poles, covered with straw.  I threw the sleeping-bag on this, and was soon stretched out.  Misgivings as to my strength worried me before I closed my eyes. Once  on my back, I felt I could not rise; my chest was sore; my cough deep  and rasping. It seemed I had scarcely closed my eyes when Jones's  impatient voice recalled me from sweet oblivion.    \"Frank, Frank, it's daylight. Jim--boys!\" he called.    I tumbled out in a gray, wan twilight. It was cold enough to make the  fire acceptable, but nothing like the morning before on Buckskin.    \"Come to the festal board,\" drawled Jim, almost before I had my boots  laced.    \"Jones,\" said Frank, \"Jim an' I'll ooze round here to-day. There's lots  to do, an' we want to have things hitched right before we strike for  the Siwash. We've got to shoe Old Baldy, an' if we can't get him  locoed, it'll take all of us to do it.\"    The light was still gray when Jones led off with Don, Wallace with  Sounder and I with Moze. Jones directed us to separate, follow the dry  stream beds in the ravines, and remember his instructions given the  night before.    The ravine to the right, which I entered, was choked with huge stones  fallen from the cliff above, and pinyons growing thick; and I wondered  apprehensively how a man could evade a wild animal in such a place,  much less chase it. Old Moze pulled on his chain and sniffed at coyote  and deer tracks. And every time he evinced interest in such, I cut him  with a switch, which, to tell the truth, he did not notice. I thought I  heard a shout, and holding Moze tight, I waited and listened.    \"Waa-hoo--waa-hoo!\" floated on the air, rather deadened as if it had  come from round the triangular cliff that faced into the valley. Urging  and dragging Moze, I ran down the ravine as fast as I could, and soon  encountered Wallace coming from the middle ravine. \"Jones,\" he said  excitedly,  \"this way--there's the signal again.\" We dashed in haste  for the mouth of the third ravine, and came suddenly upon Jones,  kneeling under a pinyon tree. \"Boys, look!\" he exclaimed, as he pointed  to the ground. There, clearly defined in the dust, was a cat track as  big as my spread hand, and the mere sight of it sent a chill up my  spine. \"There's a lion track for you; made by a female, a two-year-old;  but can't say if she passed here last night. Don won't take the trail.  Try Moze.\"    I led Moze to the big, round imprint, and put his nose down into it.  The old hound sniffed and sniffed, then lost interest.    \"Cold!\" ejaculated Jones. \"No go. Try Sounder. Come, old boy, you've  the nose for it.\"    He urged the reluctant hound forward. Sounder needed not to be shown  the trail; he stuck his nose in it, and stood very quiet for a long  moment; then he quivered slightly, raised his nose and sought the next  track. Step by step he went slowly, doubtfully. All at once his tail  wagged stiffly.    \"Look at"]]]
