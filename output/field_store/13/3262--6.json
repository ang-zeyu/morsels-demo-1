Walk in, gentlemen, pray walk in;--here they are, the family of  the Surfaces, up to the Conquest.    SIR OLIVER. And, in my opinion, a goodly collection.    CHARLES. Ay, ay, these are done in the true spirit of portrait-painting;  no volontiere grace or expression. Not like the works of your modern  Raphaels, who give you the strongest resemblance, yet contrive to make  your portrait independent of you; so that you may sink the original  and not hurt the picture. No, no; the merit of these is the inveterate  likeness--all stiff and awkward as the originals, and like nothing in  human nature besides.    SIR OLIVER. Ah! we shall never see such figures of men again.    CHARLES. I hope not. Well, you see, Master Premium, what a domestic  character I am; here I sit of an evening surrounded by my family. But  come, get to your pulpit, Mr. Auctioneer; here's an old gouty chair of  my grandfather's will answer the purpose.    CARELESS. Ay, ay, this will do. But, Charles, I haven't a hammer; and  what's an auctioneer without his hammer?    CHARLES. Egad, that's true. What parchment have we here? Oh, our  genealogy in full. [Taking pedigree down.] Here, Careless, you shall  have no common bit of mahogany, here's the family tree for you,  you rogue! This shall be your hammer, and now you may knock down my  ancestors with their own pedigree.    SIR OLIVER. What an unnatural rogue!--an ex post facto parricide!  [Aside.]    CARELESS. Yes, yes, here's a list of your generation indeed;--faith,  Charles, this is the most convenient thing you could have found for the  business, for 'twill not only serve as a hammer, but a catalogue into  the bargain. Come, begin--A-going, a-going, a-going!    CHARLES. Bravo, Careless! Well, here's my great uncle, Sir Richard  Ravelin, a marvellous good general in his day, I assure you. He served  in all the Duke of Marlborough's wars, and got that cut over his eye  at the battle of Malplaquet. What say you, Mr. Premium? look at  him--there's a hero! not cut out of his feathers, as your modern clipped  captains are, but enveloped in wig and regimentals, as a general should  be. What do you bid?    SIR OLIVER. [Aside to Moses.] Bid him speak.    MOSES. Mr. Premium would have you speak.    CHARLES. Why, then, he shall have him for ten pounds, and I'm sure  that's not dear for a staff-officer.    SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Heaven deliver me! his famous uncle Richard for ten  pounds!--[Aloud.] Very well, sir, I take him at that.    CHARLES. Careless, knock down my uncle Richard.--Here, now, is a maiden  sister of his, my great-aunt Deborah, done by Kneller, in his best  manner, and esteemed a very formidable likeness. There she is, you see,  a shepherdess feeding her flock. You shall have her for five pounds  ten--the sheep are worth the money.    SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Ah! poor Deborah! a woman who set such a value on  herself!--[Aloud.] Five pounds ten--she's mine.    CHARLES. Knock down my aunt Deborah! Here, now, are two that were a sort  of cousins of theirs.--You see, Moses, these pictures were done some  time ago, when beaux wore wigs, and the ladies their own hair.    SIR OLIVER. Yes, truly, head-dresses appear to have been a little lower  in those days.    CHARLES. Well, take that couple for the same.    MOSES. 'Tis a good bargain.    CHARLES. Careless!--This, now, is a grandfather of my mother's, a  learned judge, well known on the western circuit,--What do you rate him  at, Moses?    MOSES. Four guineas.    CHARLES. Four guineas! Gad's life, you don't bid me the price of his  wig.--Mr. Premium, you have more respect for the woolsack; do let us  knock his lordship down at fifteen.    SIR OLIVER. By all means.    CARELESS. Gone!    CHARLES. And there are two brothers of his, William and Walter Blunt,  Esquires, both members of Parliament, and noted speakers; and, what's  very extraordinary, I believe, this is the first time they were ever  bought or sold.    SIR OLIVER. That is very extraordinary, indeed! I'll take them at your  own price, for the honour of Parliament.    CARELESS. Well said, little Premium! I'll knock them down at forty.    CHARLES. Here's a jolly fellow--I don't know what relation, but he was  mayor of Norwich: take him at eight pounds.    SIR OLIVER. No, no; six will do for the mayor.    CHARLES. Come, make it guineas, and I'll throw you the two aldermen here  into the bargain.    SIR OLIVER. They're mine.    CHARLES. Careless, knock down the mayor and aldermen. But, plague on't!  we shall be all day retailing in this manner; do let us deal wholesale:  what say you, little Premium? Give me three hundred pounds for the rest  of the family in the lump.    CARELESS. Ay, ay, that will be the best way.    SIR OLIVER. Well, well, anything to accommodate you; they are mine. But  there is one portrait which you have always passed over.    CARELESS. What, that ill-looking little fellow over the settee?    SIR OLIVER. Yes, sir, I mean that; though I don't think him so  ill-looking a little fellow, by any means.    CHARLES. What, that? Oh; that's my uncle Oliver! 'Twas done before he  went to India.    CARELESS. Your uncle Oliver! Gad, then you'll never be friends,  Charles. That, now, to me, is as stern a looking rogue as ever I saw; an  unforgiving eye, and a damned disinheriting countenance! an inveterate  knave, depend on't. Don't you think so, little Premium?    SIR OLIVER. Upon my soul, Sir, I do not; I think it is as honest a  looking face as any in the room, dead or alive. But I suppose uncle  Oliver goes with the rest of the lumber?    CHARLES. No, hang it! I'll not part with poor Noll. The old fellow has  been very good to me, and, egad, I'll keep his picture while I've a room  to put it in.    SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] The rogue's my nephew after all!--[Aloud.] But,  sir, I have somehow taken a fancy to that picture.    CHARLES. I'm sorry for't, for you certainly will not have it. Oons,  haven't you got enough of them?    SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] I forgive him everything!--[Aloud.] But, Sir, when  I take a whim in my head, I don't value money. I'll give you as much for  that as for all the rest.    CHARLES. Don't tease me, master broker; I tell you I'll not part with  it, and there's an end of it.    SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] How like his father the dog is.--[Aloud.] Well,  well, I have done.--[Aside.] I did not perceive it before, but I think  I never saw such a striking resemblance.--[Aloud.] Here is a draught for  your sum.    CHARLES. Why, 'tis for eight hundred pounds!    SIR OLIVER. You will not let Sir Oliver go?    CHARLES. Zounds! no! I tell you, once more.    SIR OLIVER. Then never mind the difference, we'll balance that another  time. But give me your hand on the bargain; you are an honest fellow,  Charles--I beg pardon, sir, for being so free.--Come, Moses.    CHARLES. Egad, this is a whimsical old fellow!--But hark'ee, Premium,  you'll prepare lodgings for these gentlemen.    SIR OLIVER. Yes, yes, I'll send for them in a day or two.    CHARLES. But, hold; do now send a genteel conveyance for them, for, I  assure you, they were most of them used to ride in their own carriages.    SIR OLIVER. I will, I will--for all but Oliver.    CHARLES. Ay, all but the little nabob.    SIR OLIVER. You're fixed on that?    CHARLES. Peremptorily.    SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] A dear extravagant rogue!--[Aloud.] Good day! Come,  Moses.--[Aside.] Let me hear now who dares call him profligate!         [Exit with MOSES.]    CARELESS. Why, this is the oddest genius of the sort I ever met with!    CHARLES. Egad, he's the prince of brokers, I think. I wonder how  the devil Moses got acquainted with so honest a fellow.--Ha! here's  Rowley.--Do, Careless, say I'll join the company in a few moments.    CARELESS. I will--but don't let that old blockhead persuade you to  squander any of that money on old musty debts, or any such nonsense; for  tradesmen, Charles, are the most exorbitant fellows.    CHARLES. Very true, and paying them is only encouraging them.    CARELESS. Nothing else.    CHARLES. Ay, ay, never fear.--         [Exit CARELESS.]  So! this was an odd old fellow, indeed. Let me see, two-thirds of these  five hundred and thirty odd pounds are mine by right. Fore Heaven!  I find one's ancestors are more valuable relations than I took them  for!--Ladies and gentlemen, your most obedient and very grateful  servant.     [Bows ceremoniously to the pictures.]         Enter ROWLEY    Ha! old Rowley! egad, you are just come in time to take leave of your  old acquaintance.    ROWLEY. Yes, I heard they were a-going. But I wonder you can have such  spirits under so many distresses.    CHARLES. Why, there's the point! my distresses are so many, that I can't  affort to part with my spirits; but I shall be rich and splenetic, all  in good time. However, I suppose you are surprised that I am not more  sorrowful at parting with so many near relations; to be sure, 'tis very  affecting; but you see they never move a muscle, so why should I?    ROWLEY. There's no making you serious a moment.    CHARLES. Yes, faith, I am so now. Here, my honest Rowley, here, get me  this changed directly, and take a hundred pounds of it immediately to  old Stanley.    ROWLEY. A hundred pounds! Consider only----    CHARLES. Gad's life, don't talk about it! poor Stanley's wants are  pressing, and, if you don't make haste, we shall have some one call that  has a better right to the money.    ROWLEY. Ah! there's the point! I never will cease dunning you with the  old proverb----    CHARLES. BE JUST BEFORE YOU'RE GENEROUS.--Why, so I would if I could;  but Justice is an old hobbling beldame, and I can't get her to keep pace  with Generosity, for the soul of me.    ROWLEY. Yet, Charles, believe me, one hour's reflection----    CHARLES. Ay, ay, it's very true; but, hark'ee, Rowley, while I have, by  Heaven I'll give; so, damn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19298"],[0,"The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh (#11)"],[1," the fairest  fruit of the fairest civilization the world has yet seen.    Might not the hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah mark the inauguration of so vast an era in human history?    Your true brother,  SHOGHI    Haifa, Palestine,  November 28, 1931            THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE CAUSE OF BAHA'U'LLAH          The Golden Age of the Cause of Baha'u'llah      To the beloved of God and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the  United States and Canada.    Friends and fellow-defenders of the Faith of Baha'u'llah:    Significant as have been the changes that have lately overtaken a swiftly  awakening humanity at this transitional phase of its checkered history,  the steady consolidation of the institutions which the administrators of  the Faith of Baha'u'llah are, in every land, toiling to establish should  appear no less remarkable to even those who are as yet imperfectly  acquainted with the obstacles they have had to surmount or the meagre  resources on which they could rely.    That a Faith which, ten years ago, was severely shaken by the sudden  removal of an incomparable Master should have, in the face of tremendous  obstacles, maintained its unity, resisted the malignant onslaught of its  ill-wishers, silenced its calumniators, broadened the basis of its  far-flung administration, and raised upon it institutions symbolizing its  ideals of worship and service, should be deemed sufficient evidence of the  invincible power with which the Almighty has chosen to invest it from the  moment of its inception.    That the Cause associated with the name of Baha'u'llah feeds itself upon  those hidden springs of celestial strength which no force of human  personality, whatever its glamour, can replace; that its reliance is  solely upon that mystic Source with which no worldly advantage, be it  wealth, fame, or learning can compare; that it propagates itself by ways  mysterious and utterly at variance with the standards accepted by the  generality of mankind, will, if not already apparent, become increasingly  manifest as it forges ahead towards fresh conquests in its struggle for  the spiritual regeneration of mankind.    Indeed, how could it, unsupported as it has ever been by the counsels and  the resources of the wise, the rich, and the learned in the land of its  birth, have succeeded in breaking asunder the shackles that weighed upon  it at the hour of its birth, in emerging unscathed from the storms that  agitated its infancy, had not its animating breath been quickened by that  spirit which is born of God, and on which all success, wherever and  however it be sought, must ultimately depend?    It is not necessary for me to recall, even in their briefest outline, the  heart-rending details of that appalling tragedy which marked the  birth-pangs of our beloved Faith, enacted in a land notorious for its  unrestrained fanaticisms, its crass ignorance, its unbridled cruelty. Nor  do I need to expatiate on the valor, the sublime fortitude, that defied  the cruel torture-mongers of that race, or stress the number, or emphasize  the purity of the lives, of those who died willingly that their Cause  might live and prosper. Nor is it necessary to dwell upon the indignation  which those atrocities evoked, and the feelings of unqualified admiration  that surged, in the breasts of countless men and women, in regions remote  from the scene of those indescribable cruelties. Suffice it to say that  upon these heroes of Baha'u'llah's native land was bestowed the  inestimable privilege of sealing with their life-blood the early triumphs  of their cherished Faith, and of paving the way for its approaching  victory. In the blood of the unnumbered martyrs of Persia lay the seed of  the Divinely-appointed Administration which, though transplanted from its  native soil, is now budding out, under your loving care, into a new order,  destined to overshadow all mankind.          America's Contribution to the Cause      For great as have been the attainments and unforgettable the services of  the pioneers of the heroic age of the Cause in Persia, the contribution  which their spiritual descendants, the American believers, the  champion-builders of the organic structure of the Cause, are now making  towards the fulfillment of the Plan which must usher in the golden age of  the Cause is no less meritorious in this strenuous period of its history.  Few, if any, I venture to assert, among these privileged framers and  custodians of the constitution of the Faith of Baha'u'llah are even dimly  aware of the preponderating role which the North American continent is  destined to play in the future orientation of their world-embracing Cause.  Nor does any appreciable number among them seem sufficiently conscious of  the decisive influence which they already exercise in the direction and  management of its affairs.    \"The continent of America,\" wrote 'Abdu'l-Baha in February, 1917, \"is, in  the eyes of the one true God, the land wherein the splendors of His light  shall be revealed, where the mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled,  where the righteous will abide, and the free assemble.\"    That the supporters of the Cause of Baha'u'llah, throughout the United  States and Canada, are increasingly demonstrating the truth of this solemn  affirmation is evident to even a casual observer of the record of their  manifold services, whether in their individual capacities or through their  concerted endeavors. The manifestations of spontaneous loyalty which  marked their response to the expressed wishes of a departed Master; the  generosity with which they have, on more than one occasion, arisen to lend  a helping hand to the needy and harassed among their brethren in Persia;  the vigor with which they have resisted the shameless attacks which  unrelenting enemies, both from within and without, have, with increasing  frequency, launched against them; the example which the body of their  national representatives have set to their sister Assemblies in fashioning  the instruments essential to the effective discharge of their collective  duties; their successful intervention on behalf of their persecuted  fellow-workers in Russia; the moral support they have extended to their  Egyptian fellow-disciples at a most critical stage in their struggle for  emancipation from the fetters of Islamic orthodoxy; the historic services  rendered by those intrepid pioneers who, faithful to the call of  'Abdu'l-Baha, forsook their homes to plant, in the uttermost corners of  the globe, the standard of His Faith; and, last but not least, the  magnificence of their self-sacrifice, culminating in the completion of the  super-structure of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar--these stand out each as an  eloquent testimony to the indomitable character of the faith Baha'u'llah  has kindled in their hearts.    Who, contemplating so splendid a record of service, can doubt that these  faithful stewards of the redeeming grace of God have preserved, undivided  and unimpaired, the priceless heritage entrusted to their charge? Have  they not, one might well reflect, in ways which only future historians  will indicate, approached the high standard that characterized those deeds  of imperishable renown accomplished by those that have gone before them?    Not by the material resources which the members of this infant community  can now summon to their aid; not by the numerical strength of its  present-day supporters; nor by any direct tangible benefits its votaries  can as yet confer upon the multitude of the needy and the disconsolate  among their countrymen, should its potentialities be tested or its worth  determined. Nowhere but in the purity of its precepts, the sublimity of  its standards, the integrity of its laws, the reasonableness of its  claims, the comprehensiveness of its scope, the universality of its  program, the flexibility of its institutions, the lives of its founders,  the heroism of its martyrs, and the transforming power of its influence,  should the unprejudiced observer seek to obtain the true criterion that  can enable him to fathom its mysteries or to estimate its virtue.          Decline of Mortal Dominion      How unfair, how irrelevant, to venture any comparison between the slow and  gradual consolidation of the Faith proclaimed by Baha'u'llah and those  man-created movements which, having their origin in human desires and with  their hopes centered on mortal dominion, must inevitably decline and  perish! Springing from a finite mind, begotten of human fancy, and  oftentimes the product of ill-conceived designs, such movements succeed,  by reason of their novelty, their appeal to man's baser instincts and  their dependence upon the resources of a sordid world, in dazzling for a  time the eyes of men, only to plunge finally from the heights of their  meteoric career into the darkness of oblivion, dissolved by the very  forces that had assisted in their creation.    Not so with the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. Born in an environment of  appalling degradation, springing from a soil steeped in age-long  corruptions, hatreds and prejudice, inculcating principles irreconcilable  with the accepted standards of the times, and faced from the beginning  with the relentless enmity of government, church and people, this nascent  Faith of God has, by virtue of the celestial potency with which it has  been endowed, succeeded, in less than four score years and ten, in  emancipating itself from the galling chains of Islamic domination, in  proclaiming the self-sufficiency of its ideals and the independent  integrity of its laws, in planting its banner in no less than forty of the  most advanced countries of the world, in establishing its outposts in  lands beyond the farthest seas, in consecrating its religious edifices in  the midmost heart of the Asiatic and American continents, in inducing two  of the most powerful governments of the West to"]]]
