In its large garden, which extends down to the sea, are  planted myrtles, figs, mulberries, and other trees of the south of Europe.  Beauport has been called the Chartreuse of Brittany. It is a lovely  secluded spot, as, indeed, are most of the sites of the old abbeys,  varying in aspect, but always beautiful. No description can give an idea  of the magnificent panoramic views from the walls of the abbey.    [Illustration: 20. Abbey of Beauport.]    M. Merimee justly observes, \"It appears strange that, in so early a stage  of civilisation, the monks should be so alive to the beauties of nature.  The contemplative habits of monastic life must at all times have imparted  to the mind a feeling of abstract beauty, independent of any idea of real  utility. Secure of an uniform, peaceful existence, limited in his  pleasures and his ambition, sheltered by his sacred office, above others,  from the reverses of fortune, the monk of the thirteenth century was in a  position to love, and did love, beauty for itself. And while the knight,  at war with all the world, thought only on building an impregnable  fortress, the abbot embellished his dwelling, and tasted the enjoyments  afforded by imagination and the arts. \"The abbey of Beauport is built in  the pointed style, and is a perfect example of the monastic architecture  of the thirteenth century--the most important and most beautiful convent  ruins in Brittany. The original disposition of its buildings may yet be  clearly traced. These abbeys were all built upon the same plan. In the  centre was the square garden (preau), surrounded by the cloisters. On the  south side the church, extending from west to east; on the north, the  refectory, with the kitchen attached. On the east was the chapter-house,  and some small apartments; above these were the dormitories. Outside was  the interior court, reserved for the brethren, and beyond, the great  court, into which the provisions were brought, and round which were the  stables and farm buildings. The garden, orchard, mill, oven, dovecote,  cider-press, &c., were all within the walled enclosure, for the abbeys  were not merely convents dedicated solely to devotional exercises. After  prayer followed labour. The Breton abbeys were quite model farms; the  woods and the commons afforded the means of rearing cattle to those who  had the privilege of pasturage in the forests. Many had also the right of  acorns and beech-mast for their pigs (_droit au gland et a la faine_). One  abbey, that of Morimond (Haute Marne), is recorded to have had twenty  piggeries, of three hundred pigs each, distributed in its forests. The  monks also reared sheep and horses, and fattened fish in their ponds. They  were the first who advanced the science of horticulture and the  cultivation of vegetables. To these agricultural pursuits were added, in  many convents, the industrial arts, and some of the brethren were brewers,  curriers, fullers, weavers, shoemakers, carpenters, and blacksmiths. Their  cultivation of the liberal arts and sciences is well known. During the  Middle Ages the monasteries were the sole depositories of learning.  Beauport is now occupied by a Polish lady, Countess Poninsky, who allows  no one to enter the abbey, as her husband was buried in the church.    Two or three miles further we reached Paimpol, where we remained the  night, at a nice hotel. Paimpol is a seaport town prettily situated in a  cultivated country on the bay that bears its name. Its inhabitants are  employed in the mackerel and Iceland fisheries. The women about here wear  close straw-bonnets. They all, in this department, ride on horseback, \"a  califourchon,\" like the men.    We hired our carriage on to Treguier. At Lezardrieux we passed the estuary  of the Trieux, over a magnificent suspension-bridge, at a considerable  elevation above the water, vessels sail under it. It was built 1840, and  is 833 feet long, that is, 167 longer than the famed bridge of La Roche  Bernard (Loire Inferieure). The bridge swung frightfully when we passed  over it. In the churchyard of Pleudaniel is a pretty granite calvary, and  skulls are placed in recesses in the wall on each side of the  church-porch.    We next came to the Chateau of La Roche Jagu, on the summit of a hill  overhanging the river Trieux and defending the entrance. It has more of  the character of a \"maison forte\" than of a \"manoir,\" as was termed the  habitation of a knight, and of those who holding a fief, yet did not  possess the seignorial right to a castle with towers and donjon. The  manoir might be enclosed by walls and moats, but not with towers. The  entrance on the side opposite to the river is through a large walled court  by a low Gothic doorway, closed by an enormous iron grating of upright and  horizontal bars of great thickness, hanging on four hinges, and secured by  four locks; all the windows have gratings of the same kind. A stone  staircase leads to the one story, consisting of a suite of large rooms  half lighted by narrow windows. Some of these are occupied by the keeper  of the castle and others are reserved for the use of the proprietor, the  Marquis d'Argentre, and, when he goes there, are decorated and partly  furnished with the pieces of old tapestry lying about. At the end of these  rooms is a turret, which communicates with a covered gallery surmounting  the whole length of the facade facing the river, and commanding a  beautiful view of the windings of the silvery Trieux and of its  fir-clothed banks. This gallery is furnished with battlements, and served  the double purpose of a rampart and an observatory. The wall on the  river-side is fifteen feet thick, and a chapel hewn in the thickness of  the wall is lighted by a Gothic window looking over the Trieux. Fourteen  elegant chimney-shafts of cut stone, cylindrical in form, and ornamented  with iron spikes, give a most original character to the building. The  chateau belonged to the Marechal Duc de Richelieu, who sold it in 1773 to  the Tressan family, under the stipulation that its subterranean passages  should not be explored. They are said to extend under the bed of the river  to the Chateau of Frinandour, half a league distant.    We next passed through Pontrieux, a pretty, small town, seated in a deep  valley, the river Trieux flowing through it. The river here is famous for  salmon, and there is a considerable commerce in its little port.    La Roche-Derrien on the Jaudy, during the War of Succession in Brittany,  was a castle of some celebrity. It was here Charles of Blois was taken  prisoner by the English, who, under Sir Thomas Dagworth, were in  possession of the place. Charles of Blois assembled a large army, and  attacked them by night. Three times was he rescued, and three times  retaken; he had received eighteen wounds, and was at last compelled to  surrender. Jeanne de Montfort, like all women who hate, was very  vindictive, and caused her illustrious prisoner to be ignominiously  dragged to Quimperle, Vannes, and Hennebont, whence he was transferred to  London, and confined in the Tower. It was nine years before he regained  his liberty.  Meanwhile his heroic wife, Jeanne de Penthievre, became head  of his party, as Jeanne de Flandre was that of the De Montfort. The \"War  of the two Jeannes\" continued for nine years, during which they fought  with fierceness and courage, and ruled with ability. Curious,--the history  of France was illustrated in this century by five heroines of the name of  Jeanne: Jeanne d'Arc, Jeanne Hachette of Beauvais, and the Jeannes of  Penthievre, Flandre, and Clisson, who made themselves famous in Brittany.  On his release, Charles of Blois gave La Roche-Derrien to Du Guesclin.  The castle was demolished, but a calvary has been built on the site.    Not far from La Roche-Derrien is the church of Langoat, which contains the  monument of Ste. Pompee (1370), mother of St. Tugdual. On the granite tomb  reposes her marble effigy, and around it bas-reliefs in Gothic niches  represent the life of the saint. In all the churches in this district,  tressels are placed in the nave ready for funerals. The gravestones have  in each a little hollow well, to contain water for sprinkling over the  grave, or in some a small basin is set upon the gravestone, with a sprig  of box laid by the side, for the same pious purpose.    Every one must be struck by the excellence of the roads in Brittany, as  indeed throughout France; in no instance does the French administrative  talent more fully display itself. The roads are of three classes: the  \"routes imperiales,\" under the care of the Government; \"departementales,\"  kept entirely at the expense of the department; and the \"chemins  vicinaux,\" which belong to the communes or parishes, and which all the  inhabitants are called upon to support. To each lieue de poste (two and a  half miles), is appointed a \"cantonnier\" or road-keeper, who is  responsible for the condition of the length of road assigned to his care.    We stopped at Kermartin, a farmhouse near Treguier, to see the bed said to  have belonged to St. Ives, the favourite saint of the Bretons, and whose  name is borne by the majority of the inhabitants of the district of  Treguier and St. Brieuc. Charles of Blois held him in great veneration. He  gave part of a rib of St. Ives to the church at Lamballe, and carried the  relic in procession barefooted to the church. Before the battle of Auray,  he ordered his men to march \"in the name of God and St. Yves.\"    St. Ives, or Yves Helory, was one of the most remarkable characters of the  thirteenth century. He studied law in the schools of Paris, and applied  his talents in defending the cause of the poor; hence he was called \"the  poor man's advocate;\" and so great to this day is the confidence placed in  his justice, that, in the department of the Cotes-du-Nord, when a debtor  falsely denies his debt, a peasant will pay twenty sous for a mass to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22716"],[0,"The Book-Hunter at Home (#11)"],[1,"him,  in history at least. And he will visit out-of-the-way spots unnoticed by  these authorities, but dear to him by reason of their mention in the  pages of his fireside Mentors, their association with some thrilling  though unimportant event of which he has read. Harbours, villages,  buildings, will be familiar to him through some old print or coloured  engraving; and he will eagerly compare the actual appearance with the  mental picture he has borne for so long. Disappointment sometimes there  will be, but a delightful anticipation always.    I hope, however, that I shall never be his travelling companion!    And here I cannot forbear to mention one other book-collecting  acquaintance. A bosom friend of the genealogist, he was at one time a  fellow-worker, and they would sit closeted for hours debating the  parentage of Henry ap John. But he lacked that determination which  prevented his friend from being constantly side-tracked, and the minutiae  of history had a fatal attraction for him. As to whether Hugo de  Beauchamp of _Com. Wigorn._ (which was their pleasant way of saying that  he lived in Worcestershire) held his manor by serjeanty of the  _condimentum_ was of small moment to him compared with the price which  King Edward paid him for a couple of goshawks or a greyhound; and he  wondered of what sort was the tun of wine which he had from that  sovereign as a Christmas present. And so his book-buying became more and  more confined, for it was restricted now to those curious and uncommon  works which treat of the byways of history; such as the Accounts of the  Wardrobe and Hanaper, the reports of the lords marchers of the realm,  books on feudal customs and offices, and the like.    During the great war our friend busied himself with His Majesty's  ordnance. Hitherto he had always associated the term with cast-iron  cannon, and had vague recollections of the number of 'ordnance' carried  by the Great Harry or fired from the Tower of London during Sir Thomas  Wyatt's insurrection. But even when these dreams were dispelled, his  thoughts still harped on mediaeval equipment and harness while checking  cases of boots or mess-tins; and he wondered how such things were managed  before the days of railways. Released at length from this employ, his  interest increased with leisure to pursue his investigations.    His passion now is the method in which the ancient campaigns of this  country were conducted. He is quite an authority upon mediaeval transport,  by sea as well as by land, and he can tell you at once the quantities of  bowstrings and quarrels 'indented for' during the Crecy and Poictiers  campaigns. Not long ago, poring over an ancient roll of parchment in the  Record Office, he came across a list of the ships requisitioned for the  Agincourt expedition, with their names, ports, and tonnage, inscribed on  the back of one of the membranes. Great was his delight, and it will be  some time before his friends will be allowed to forget this important  discovery.    How valuable are these researches of our book-collecting friends! Do they  not add a zest to those delightful evenings when, with curtains drawn and  blazing fire, our favourite pipe aglow, a tall glass at our elbow, we  hunt our treasures o'er again in comfort, roaming the bookstalls of our  fancy? It is well, however, that our humours in book-lore are not all  alike, else how tedious would some of these conferences become. Elation  and jealousy would be hard to banish at times when we held some coveted  volume in our hands. But with divergence of tastes such feelings cannot  exist, and we eagerly share our friends' enthusiasm in their treasures  and their delight in some newly-found gem.    It is a very serious business, this book-collecting. Whether we are  contented now to let our library be slow of growth, or whether we are  still imbued with the ardour of our early youth, we are none the less  under the spell of books. Our paths may lie outside the pale of book-land  for years, but the chance handling of a valuable or scarce volume will  instantly awaken all our bibliophilic desires. Book-collecting is not  like other pursuits. In after years we may realise that many of our  hobbies are but vanities, but the love of good books is something far  beyond all these ephemeral pursuits.    Doubtless few of us realised at the outset of our careers as book  collectors how completely we should be mastered by this love of books.  Who did not think that it comprised but occasional visits to the  book-shops and bookstalls, perhaps even to an auction-room, and the  reading of nondescript catalogues? But it is like all other hobbies:  ridden at first with too little restraint, it soon gets the upper hand,  and off it goes, bit between teeth, carrying its rider ever farther and  farther afield. And no man of spirit would think of seeking to curb his  hobby's gallop. We have mounted of our own free will, determined to  pursue the chase, and never shall it be said that we were too timid to  face the difficulties of the country ahead. The greater the difficulties  the greater the sport, and in our enthusiasm we are determined to  overcome all obstacles. So that, though our hobby may at length become  our master, so enthralled are we in the pursuit that there is little  danger of it assuming the semblance of a nightmare.    The farther we go, the wider the fields which open to our view, and there  is interest for us in all of them. We roam at our pleasure over vast  fields of literature, digressing here and there just as our fancy takes  us. There is no danger, moreover, in being side-tracked, for such  divagations in the realms of bibliography as we may make will serve but  to increase our knowledge of books in the right direction. The only risk  that we shall incur is that of becoming specialists, which is precisely  what we should most desire.    And how delightful are these digressions in the world of books! There is  no other occupation in which one may wander so innocuously. In most of  the learned professions digressions are fatal to success. Anthony  Despeisses was a lawyer who used frequently to digress. Beginning one day  in Court to talk of Ethiopia, an attorney who sat behind him remarked  'Heavens! He is got into Ethiopia, he will never come back.' Despeisses,  we are told, was so abashed with the ridicule that he chose rather to  leave off pleading than to correct himself of this unfortunate habit,  and quitted the Bar for ever. Doubtless he found solace among his books,  for here at least he could digress to his heart's content.    Although, from a worldly point of view, side-tracks are fatal to success,  yet they are as necessary a part of our literary education as is the  application to study itself. Without digressing as we applied ourselves  to books, narrow indeed would be the views that we acquired. Of what  value is a vast acquaintance with the material details of a war, if we  are ignorant as to the causes which brought it about, or the reasons why  the nations were warring? 'Ah yes,' perhaps you may exclaim, 'but  politics and history are all one, for the former creates the latter.'  Precisely: so that in order to obtain a knowledge of the one, we must  deviate to the other. Sharon Turner in his 'History of England during the  Middle Ages' passes abruptly from the death of King Henry the Second to  the military spirit of Mohammedanism, from the Troubadours to the early  dissipations of King John, and devotes two of his five volumes to the  Literature of England with copious examples of early poetry. It is all  history, yet how indispensable are the side-tracks.    It is a subtle art, however, this knowledge of how and when to digress,  and not easy to be learnt. Gerard de St. Amand died of grief in his  middle age because Louis XIV. could not bear his reading of a poem on the  Moon, in which he praised the King for his skill in swimming. On the  other hand Madame de Stael obtained almost all the material for her  literary work by a consummate skill in directing the digressions of  conversation. Upon whatever subject her pen was engaged, that was the  theme to which she led all talk.    Sir Thomas Browne's famous letter 'To a friend upon occasion of the death  of his intimate friend' is a masterpiece of the art of digressing. Surely  it is one of the quaintest letters of condolence ever written, if indeed  it were ever intended to be such, for it has that stamp of careful  literary composition which is usually so apparent in all letters written  with a view to publication. The friend in question died of a consumption,  and Sir Thomas recapitulates his disease, symptoms and death; contrasting  each feature with the celebrated examples of history; moralising and  discussing the opinions of the ancients upon these points as he goes  along; and showing by his own experience that a man 'after a cough of  almost fifty years, in whom all the lobes adhered unto the Pleura,' might  yet die of stone in the bladder. Doubtless the friend to whom the letter  was indited was highly edified by the aged doctor's learning, yet one  cannot conceive that he would be greatly consoled by being informed, when  discussing the patient's cough, that 'in cetaceous Fishes, who have large  and strong lungs, the same is not observed; nor yet in oviparous  Quadrupeds.' Digressing in this manner is a risky business, and if the  grief were still fresh, it is more than likely that the bereaved one  would exclaim 'A fig for your fishes, Sir.' But Sir Thomas was a wise and  worldly man, and would know from experience precisely when to administer  his soothing draught.    The attractions of digressing are far more insidious than would appear at  first sight. It is so easy, one finds such delightful things, it is all  in the daily task of gathering knowledge, it may be useful to us some  day, and so on. But, unwisely employed, it is a more terrible thief of"]]]
