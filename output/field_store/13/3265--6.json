The younger children's hands were guided by the representatives of  the gods. It would be a great fatality to sprinkle a drop of meal over the  eye holes; the individual committing such an error would become blind at  least in one eye. Great care is also taken that the line is run up the  cheek, for if it was run down not only would vegetation be stunted, but  the lives of the people would become so, as all people and things should  aim upward not downward. The line running down through the center of the  face calls upon the gods above to send down rain upon the earth and health  to all people. Two or three children started through ignorance to run the  meal down one of the cheeks; they were instantly stopped by Hasjelti, but  not until the people looking on had expressed great horror. All in the  line having gone through this ceremony the crowd of spectators sprinkled  the masks in the same manner. I was requested to sprinkle them, and at the  same time was specially instructed to run the lines up the cheeks. This  closed the ceremony of initiation. The boys were then permitted to go  around at will and look at the masks and enter the lodge and view the sand  painting. Hasjelti and Hostjoboard returned to the lodge, carrying their  masks in their hands.    About an hour after the ceremony of the initiation of the children a large  buffalo robe was spread on the avenue with his head to the east, around  which a circle of some hundred feet in diameter was formed by horsemen and  pedestrians who gathered, eager to witness the outdoot ceremony. The  theurgist and invalid were seated outside of the lodge, south of the  entrance. The dieties personated in this occasion were the gods Hasjelti  and Taadotjaii, and the goddess Tebahdi. Haskjelti wore black velvet and  silver ornaments, with red silk scarf around the waist. Taadotjaii was  nude, his body being painted a reddish color. The limbs and body were  zigzagged with white, representing lightning and downy breast feathers of  the eagle, and in his right hand a gourd rattle devoid of ornamentation.  Yebahdi wore the ordinary squaw's dress and moccasins, with many silver  ornaments, and a large blanket around her shoulders touching the ground.  Hasjelti approached dancing, and sprinkled meal over the buffalo robe, and  the invalid stood upon the robe. Hasjelti, followed by Zaadoltjaii, again  entered the circle and sprinkled meal upon the robe. The goddess Yebahdi  following, stood within the circle some 20 feet from the robe on the east  side and facing west. Hasjelti, amidst hoots and anties, sprinkled meal  upon the invalid, throwing both his hands upward. Immediately Zaadoltjaii,  with arrow in the left hand and rattle int he right, threw both hands up  over the invalid amidst hoots and antics. They then passed to Yebahdi, who  holds with both hands a basket containing the two yellow ears of corn  wrapped with pine twigs that were used in the children's ceremony, and  indulged in similar antics over the goddess. As each representative of the  gods threw up his hands she raised her basket high above and in front of  her head. Hasjelti, together with Zaadoltjaii and Yebahdi, then passed  around within the circle to the other three points of the compass. At each  point Yebahdi took her position about 20 feet from the buffalo robe, when  Hasjelti and Zaadoltjhaii repeated their performance over the invalid and  then over Yebahdi each time she elevated the basket. The invalid then  entered the lodge, followed by the representatives of the gods, who were  careful to remove their masks before going in. The invalid sat on the  cornstalk in the center of the sand painting, facing east. Zaadoltjaii  stepped upon the painting, and taking the little medicine gourd from the  hands of the rainbow goddess, dipped the cedar twig into the medicine  water and sprinkled the painting, beginning at the south side. Zaadoltjaii  gave the invalid a draft from the gourd, and waving the gourd from left to  right formed a circle, amidst the wildest cries. He gave three more drafts  to the invalid, each time waving the gourd around the invalid with a wave  toward the east. He then placed the palm of his hand over the feet of all  the figures, beginning with the figure at the south end, west side;  running up that line he began with the figure on the north end east side,  running down that line; he then placed his hands to the soles of the feet  of the invalid, hooting twice; then the heart of the invalid was touched  in the same manner with the palm of the right hand, the left hand being  placed to his back. The body was pressed in this way four times amid loud  cries. This was repeated upon the invalid. After touching each figure of  the painting, the right hand was placed to the forehead of the invalid and  the left hand to the back of the head, and the head pressed in this way on  all sides. The song-priest put live coals before the invalid and upon them  sprinkled tobacco and water, the fumes of which the invalid inhaled. An  attendant then threw the coals out of the fire opening, and the  song-priest gathered the twelve turkey wands from around the painting  while the inmates of the lodge hastened forward to press their hands upon  what remained of the figures, then drawing a breath from their hands, they  pressed them upon their bodies that they might be cured of any  infirmities, moral or physical, after which four men gathered at the  points of the compass and swept the sand to the center of the painting,  and placing it in a blanket deposited it a short distance from the lodge.            NINTH DAY.          FIRST CEREMONY.      The final decoration of masks with ribbons, plumes, etc., began at sunrise  and consumed most of the morning. About noon two sticks 1 inch in diameter  and 6 inches long were colored; one, of pinon, was painted black, the  other, of cedar, was colored red. Three medicine tubes were made, one  black, one red, and one blue. These were placed in a basket half filled  with meal; the basket stood in the niche behind the song-priest. Two men  personated Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni. Naiyenesgony's body was  painted black (from the embers of a burnt weed of which specimens were  procured) and on the outside of his legs below the knee, on the upper  arms, breast and scapula were bows in white but without arrows.  Tobaidischinni had his body painted with the scalp knot in white in  relative positions to the bows on Naiyenesgony. A third man, personating  the turquois hermaphrodite Ahsonnutli, wore the usual squaw's dress with a  blanket fastened over the shoulders reaching to the ground. Her mask was  blue. The three left the lodge carrying their masks in their hands.  Passing some distance down the avenue to the east they put on their masks  and returned to the lodge. A buffalo robe had been spread in front of the  lodge. Just as the maskers returned, the invalid, wrapped in a fine red  Navajo blanket and bearing a basket of sacred meal, stepped upon the robe;  he had before stood in front of the lodge by the side of the song-priest.  The many spectators on foot and horseback clad in their rich blankets  formed a brilliant surrounding for this ceremony, which took place just at  the setting of the son. Naiyenesgony carried in his right hand a large  lava celt which was painted white. Tobaidischinni followed next carrying  in his right hand the black wood stick which had been prepared in the  morning, and in his left hand the red stick. Ahsonnutli followed with bow  and arrow in the left hand and an arrow in the right with a quiver thrown  over the shoulder.    Naiyenesgony drew so close to the invalid that their faces almost touched  and pointed his celt toward the invalid. Tobaidischinni then approached  and in the same manner pointed the sticks toward him, after which he was  approached by Ahsonnutli with her bow and arrows. This was repeated on the  south, west, and north sides of the invalid; each time the invalid  partially turned his arm, shoulder, and back to sprinkle meal upon the  gods. The gods then rushed to the entrance of the medicine lodge repeating  the ceremony there, when they hurried to the south side of the lodge (the  invalid having returned to the lodge; the buffalo robe was carried in by  an attendant). The gods went from the south side of the lodge to the west  and then to the north performing the same ceremony. As the invalid had  spent many days in the lodge and the disease at each day's ceremony exuded  from his body, it was deemed necessary that these gods should go to the  four points of the compass and draw the disease from the lodge. When they  entered the lodge the buffalo robe had been spread in front of the  song-priest with its head north. Upon this robe each god knelt on his left  knee, Naiyenesgony on the north end of the robe, Ahsonnutli on the south  end, and Tobaidischinni between them, all facing east. The song-priest,  followed by the invalid, advanced to the front of the line carrying the  basket containing the medicine tubes. He sprinkled Naiyenesgony with corn  pollen, passing it up the right arm over the head and down the left arm to  the hand. He placed the black tube in the palm, of the left hand of the  god, the priest chanting all the while a prayer. The red tube was given  with the same ceremony to Tobaidischinni, and the blue tube with the same  ceremony to Ahsonnutli. The quiver was removed from Ahsonnutli before she  knelt. The song-priest, kneeling in front of Naiyenesgony, repeated a long  litany with responses by the invalid, when the gods left the lodge led by  Naiyenesgony who deposited his tube and stick in a pinon tree,  Tobaidischinni depositing his in a cedar tree, and Ahsonnutli hers in the  heart of a shrub.          SECOND CEREMONY.      The scene was a brilliant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19337"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#11)"],[1,"an interest he had never felt before, \"tell  me if Tiny Tim will live.\"    \"I see a vacant seat,\" replied the Ghost, \"in the poor chimney-corner,  and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows  remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.\"    \"No, no,\" said Scrooge. \"Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.\"    \"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my  race,\" returned the Ghost, \"will find him here. What then? If he be like  to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\"    Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and  was overcome with penitence and grief.    \"Man,\" said the Ghost, \"if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear  that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is, and  Where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It  may be that, in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit  to live than millions like this poor man's child. Oh God! to hear the  Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry  brothers in the dust!\"    Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and, trembling, cast his eyes  upon the ground. But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name.    \"Mr. Scrooge!\" said Bob. \"I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the  Feast!\"    \"The Founder of the Feast, indeed!\" cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. \"I  wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and  I hope he'd have a good appetite for it.\"    \"My dear,\" said Bob, \"the children! Christmas-day.\"    \"It should be Christmas-day, I am sure,\" said she, \"on which one drinks  the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr.  Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do,  poor fellow!\"    \"My dear!\" was Bob's mild answer. \"Christmas-day.\"    \"I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,\" said Mrs. Cratchit,  \"not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year!  He'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!\"    The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their  proceedings which had no heartiness in it. Tiny Tim drank it last of  all, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the  family. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which  was not dispelled for full five minutes.    After it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before, from  the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit  told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which  would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two  young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man  of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from  between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular  investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that  bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's,  then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she  worked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for  a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how  she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord  \"was much about as tall as Peter\"; at which Peter pulled up his collars  so high, that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All  this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by  they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny  Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.    There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;  they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;  their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely  did, the inside of a pawn-broker's. But they were happy, grateful,  pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they  faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's  torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny  Tim, until the last.    By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as  Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the  roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was  wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a  cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,  and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.  There, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to  meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the  first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window blinds of  guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and  fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near  neighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them  enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!    But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to  friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to  give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting  company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how  the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its  capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand, its  bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very  lamp-lighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of  light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out  loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamp-lighter that  he had any company but Christmas.    And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a  bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast  about, as though it were the burial-place or giants; and water spread  itself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost  that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,  rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery  red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,  and, frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of  darkest night.    \"What place is this?\" asked Scrooge.    \"A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,\"  returned the Spirit. \"But they know me. See!\"    A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced  towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a  cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and  woman, with their children and their children's children, and another  generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.  The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind  upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a  very old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined  in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got  quite blithe and loud; and, so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank  again.    The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,  passing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To  Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful  range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the  thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the  dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.    Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,  on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there  stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,  and storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the  water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.    But, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire that  through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of  brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough  table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their  can of grog; and one of them, the elder too, with his face all damaged  and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might  be, struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.    Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until,  being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a  ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the  bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their  several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or  had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of  some bygone Christmas-day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And  every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder  word for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had  shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he  cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember  him.    It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of  the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the  lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as  profound as death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus  engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to  Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew's, and to find himself in a  bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his  side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!    \"Ha, ha!\" laughed Scrooge's nephew. \"Ha, ha, ha!\""]]]
