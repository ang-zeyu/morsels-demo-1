We  are all trusting you to take care of us for the next few hours.  Good-night.\"    \"Good-night, father.\"    The boy shouldered the double rifle and followed the doctor.    \"I should keep moving, Mark, my boy,\" said the latter.  \"It will occupy  your attention and make the time seem to pass more quickly.  It will  keep you warm too, for it's sure to be very chilly later on.  Stop here  a minute or two.  I just want to go to the forward waggon and say a word  or two to the men.  I will join you again directly.\"    Mark drew himself up stiffly as the doctor walked away, and then his  heart seemed to give a bound, for there was a faint rustle just in  front, and the boy brought his piece down to the present and made the  locks click.  \"It's only me, sir,\" said a familiar voice.  \"You, Dan!\"  cried the boy, pressing one hand on the region of his heart, which was  beating fast.    \"Yes, sir; just me.  You need not shoot.  I have been waiting till the  doctor had gone.  I thought as it was rather a new job for a youngster  like you, I'd come and ask you whether you would like me to come and  keep the watch with you.  You see, it's all fresh to you, but it's the  sort of thing I have been brought up to aboard ship.\"    \"It is very good of you,\" said Mark, warming up at the man's  thoughtfulness, \"but you had better go and lie down and go to sleep.\"    \"I don't want to go to sleep, sir.\"    \"But you will lose your night's rest.\"    \"Not me, sir.  I shall just shut one eye in the morning and let that  have a snooze for a couple of hours while I get on with my work or keep  on tramp.  Then when that one's rested I can make him open and let the  other have a snooze.\"    \"No, no, it won't do,\" said Mark firmly, much as he would have liked to  have the man's company.  \"It's my duty to take the watch, and I must  take it.\"    \"Mean it, sir?\"    \"Certainly,\" replied Mark.  \"I wouldn't have it thought that--there, go  away; the doctor's coming back.\"    The sailor slipped away, and the doctor rejoined the boy, and pointed  out a beat for him which should take him right round the waggons and the  two spans of oxen.    \"There,\" he said, \"you know what you have got to do--to fire if there is  any cause for anxiety.\"    \"And I suppose I had better not go too near the river?\"    \"Oh, I don't know,\" said the doctor.  \"It's a mere stream just about  here, though I daresay it's pretty big after rain.  Good-night.  You  will wake up your cousin at about two.  Good-night.\"    \"Good-night,\" replied Mark, and he felt that his words must have sounded  short to the doctor and full of annoyance, for somehow he thought that  it was not fair for him to go away and leave such a boy as he was; and  besides, it seemed unkind after he had made such a plain allusion to the  river, for the doctor to treat it so lightly.  Of course he knew that it  was only a little river, a mere stream; but then it was big lower down,  and what was to prevent any dangerous beast or reptile from crawling up  to lie in wait for anyone that was near?    \"Never mind,\" muttered the boy, \"I suppose it's natural to feel a bit  nervous; but I am not going to show the white feather.\"    He stood still, listening and trying to make out the doctor's step, but  he could not hear a sound.    It was very dark, not a star showing, for a faint mist hung above the  trees, and for a long time the only thing he heard was a stamp that  sounded startling until he made up his mind that it must have been a  fidgety movement on the part of one of the ponies, and shouldering his  rifle, he stepped out slowly so as to pass right round the little camp.    But even that was difficult, for it was not until he was close upon the  waggons that he could make them out, and as he went on the big bullocks  were only represented to him by what seemed to be so many clumps of bush  or heaps of soil.    He walked as slowly as he could so as to make his rounds take up as much  time as possible, and as he came to the end of each traverse he tried to  think out how many minutes it must have taken.  This slow march was  completed four times, and then he came to the conclusion that about an  hour of his watch must have passed away, but only to alter his mind  after a little thought and mentally see more clearly, that it could not  be a quarter or even an eighth of what he realised now was going to be a  very long and dreary watch.    \"Well, it's no use to be impatient,\" he thought.  \"It's no worse for me  than it will be for all the rest.  One doesn't like it, but then the  pleasure of the travelling and what we shall see right up in the hilly  part where the great kopjes rise must make up for a bit of trouble.\"    He moved on again slowly, keeping a sharp look out in the direction of  the stream and feeling convinced that he had heard a splash.    Then as he listened intently he was just about to come to the conclusion  that it was fancy, when there was another, this time a regular heavy,  wallowing sound.  What it was he could not tell, but he felt sure that  it must be some huge beast making its way through the shallow water and  mud.    Mark's next thought was that the brute, whatever it might be, had left  the river and was now stealing slowly towards him.    \"Can't be a hippo,\" he thought, \"or I should hear him crashing through  the reeds and bushes.  No, it must be one of those loathsome great efts,  the scaly slimy brutes, crawling softly;\" and at the very thought of it  he pressed thumb and finger upon cock and trigger of his piece twice  over so as to prepare for action without the premonitory click that  accompanied the setting of each lock.    It was hard work to keep from turning sharply and running, but the boy  set his teeth and mastered the desire.  But he held his piece in front  with two fingers on the triggers ready to fire, when all at once from a  short distance behind him, and right in the direction in which he would  have run, there came a deep, elongated puff as of some big animal, and  he felt that his first idea was right, and that one of the huge hippos  had caused the wallowing sound in leaving the stream and then made its  way right behind him so as to cut him off from his friends.    \"The doctor might well tell me to load with ball,\" he said.  \"Why, a  shot gun would not have sent the pellets through the monster's hide.\"    There was a repetition of the heavy breath, apparently much nearer,  which set the boy's heart thumping rapidly within his chest, and then  the heavy beating began to subside as rapidly as it had commenced, for  he said to himself, \"Oh, you cowardly fool!  Why, I am standing close to  the bullocks;\" and he stepped boldly out in the direction from which the  heavy breathing had come, and began to speak softly to the great sleek  animals, a couple of them responding with what sounded like so many  sighs.    Mark's tramp around the camp became a little faster now as he stepped  out and began musing about how easy it was to frighten one's self by  imagining all sorts of horrors hidden by the darkness.    \"Why, the doctor's right,\" he said; \"I don't believe that there's  anything one might mind in the little river, and of course, if there  were lions near, the ponies and the bullocks would know it before I  should.  There, who's afraid of its being dark?  Not I.\"    And walking and pausing by turns, the boy kept his watch, working hard  to convince himself that he ought to be very proud of the confidence  placed in him.    \"There's something so real about it,\" he thought.  \"It's quite grand  marching round and round here with a loaded double-barrelled rifle over  my shoulder.  I wonder how old Dean will feel.  I'll be bound to say  he'll be just as squirmy as I was.  He won't go to sleep the first time  he's on the watch.\"    The hours seemed to pass very slowly, though it was at their usual rate,  and at last to his great satisfaction not only could he feel sure that  half of his watch must have passed, but that it was growing lighter.    It could not be the approach of dawn, for he could see a few stars  peeping out here and there, and he realised that this was caused by the  lifting of the mist under the influence of a light breeze that felt  almost chilly.    Mark was standing some little distance from the second waggon where the  ponies were picketed, when all at once his heart set up its heavy  beating again, for coming in his direction along the edge of the patch  of forest he could plainly see a big, dark animal creeping cautiously  towards where the ponies were tethered.    Mark watched it for a few moments, till he felt that it must have passed  behind the trunk of one of the larger trees, and then it was gone.    \"Could it be a lion?\" he thought.  \"No, it had not the big, shaggy head.  But it might have been a lioness, or perhaps some big leopard.  Ah!\" he  panted, \"there it is again!  It's after the ponies.  It must be!\" and  calling to mind that he had cocked his rifle, he covered the dimly-seen  animal, which was coming very slowly nearer, and he could make out that  it had moved on a few feet and then stopped, as if crouching down  waiting to make a spring.    \"What did the doctor say?\" thought Mark.  \"I was not to fire unless  there was real necessity.  There must be real necessity here, for that  beast is creeping closer and closer so as to be within easy distance for  its spring.\"    The boy hesitated no longer, but raising his rifle to his shoulder he  covered the object that was advancing, and was about to draw trigger  when he realised the fact that he was aiming at what seemed to be a  bush, while the lioness, or whatever it was, had disappeared.    Mark stared in wonder, for he could not understand how it was that an  object"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2393"],[0,"His Dog (#11)"],[1," reproof, \"suppose you leave the  interrogatory to me, if you please? Yes, I recollect that notice. My  attention was called to it at the time. But,\" again addressing Link,  \"why did you call 'Glenmuir Cavalier' a 'BIRD dog'? Was it to throw us  off the track or--\"    \"Don't know no What's-His-Name Cav'lier!\" snapped Ferris. \"This dawg's  name is Chum. Like you c'n see in my entry blank, what's layin' on the  table in front of you. I adv'tised Chum as a bird dawg because I  s'posed he WAS a bird dawg. I ain't a sharp on dawgs. He's the fust one  ever I had. If he ain't a bird dawg, 'tain't my fault. He looks more  like one than like 'tother breeds I'd seen. So I called him one.\"    \"There is no need to raise your voice at me!\" rebuked the colonel. \"I  am disposed to accept your explanation. But if you read the local  papers you must have seen--\"    \"I did read 'em,\" said Ferris. \"I read 'em steady for a month or more,  to see was there was adv'tisement fer a lost dawg. Nary an adv'tisement  did I see excep' one fer a 'sable' collie. 'Sable' means 'black.' I  know, because our dominie told me so. I asked him, when I see that  piece in the paper. Chum ain't black, nor nowheres near black. So I  knowed it couldn't be him. What d'j' want of me, anyhow?\" he demanded  once more.    \"Again, I am disposed to credit your explanation,\" boomed the colonel,  frowning down a ripple of giggles that had its rise in Miss Gault. \"And  I am disposed to acquit you of consciously dishonest intent. I am glad  to do so. Here is the situation: Early last spring, Mr. Gault,\"  indicating the sport-suit wearer at his left, \"bought from the famous  Glenmuir Collie Kennels, on the Hudson, an unusually fine young  collie--a dog for which connoisseurs predicted a great future in the  show ring. He purchased it as a gift for his daughter, Miss Marion  Gault.\"    He inclined his head slightly toward the girl; then proceeded:    \"As Mr. Glenmuir was disbanding his  kennel, Mr. Gault was able to  secure the dog--Glenmuir Cavalier. He started for Craigswold, with the  dog on the rear seat of the car. At first he kept a hand on the dog's  collar, but as the collie made no attempt to escape, he soon turned  around--he was in the front seat--and paid no more attention to him.  Just outside of Suffern, he looked back--to find Cavalier had  disappeared. He advertised, and made all possible efforts to locate the  dog. But he could get no clew to him, until to-day. Seeing this dog of  yours in the show ring, he recognized him at once.\"    The pompously booming voice, with its stilted diction, ceased. All eyes  were upon Link Ferris. The mountaineer, stung to life by the silence  and the multiple gaze, came out of his trance of shock.    \"Then--then,\" he stuttered, forcing the words from a throat sanded by  sudden dread, \"then Chum rightly b'longs to this man?\"    \"Quite so!\" assented Marden, in some relief. \"I am glad you grasp the  point so readily. Mr. Gault has talked the matter over with me, and he  is taking a remarkably broad and generous view of the case if I may say  so. He is not only willing that you should keep the cup and the cash  prize which you have won to-day, but he is also ready to pay to you the  seventy-five dollar reward he offered for the return of Glenmuir  Cavalier. I repeat, this strikes me as most gener--\"    \"NO!\" yelled Link, a spasm of foreseen loneliness sweeping over him.  \"NO!! He can't have him! Nobody can! Why Chum's my dawg! I've learned  him to fetch cows an' shake hands an'--an' everything! An' he drug me  out'n the lake, when I was a-drowndin'! An' he done a  heap more'n that  fer me! He's drug me up to my feet, out'n wuthlessness, too; an' he's  learned me that livin' is wuth while! He's my--my--he's my dawg!\" he  finished lamely, his scared eyes sweeping the circle of faces in panic  appeal.    \"That will do, Ferris!\" coldly exhorted the colonel. \"We wish no scenes  here. You will take this seventyfive dollar check which Mr. Gault has  so kindly made out for you, and you will go.\"    \"Leavin' Chum behind?\" babbled Ferris, aghast. \"Not leavin' Chum  behind? PLEASE not!\"    He pulled himself together with an effort that drove his nails bitingly  into his palms and left his face gray. He saw the uselessness of  pleading with these people of polished iron, who could not understand  his fearful loss. For the sake of Chum--for the sake of the  self-respecting man he himself had become--he would not let himself go  to pieces. Forcing his shaken voice to a dry steadiness, he addressed  the uneasily squirming Gault.    \"What d'j' you pay for Chum when you bought him off'n that Hudson River  feller--that Glenmuir chap?\" he demanded.    \"Why, as a matter of fact,\" responded Gault, \"as Colonel Marden has  told you, I couldn't have hoped to get such a promising collie at any  price it--\"    \"What d'j' you pay for him?\" insisted Link, his voice harsh and  unconsciously domineering as a vague new hope dawned on his troubled  mind.    \"I paid six hundred dollars,\" answered Gault shortly, in annoyance at  the boor's manner.    \"Good!\" approved Link, \"That gives us suthin' to go on. I'll pay you  six hundred dollars fer him back. This hundred dollars in gold an' this  yer silver cup an' seven dollars more I got with me--to bind the  bargain. An' a second mortgage on my farm fer the rest. Fer as much of  the rest,\" he amended, \"as I ain't got ready cash for.\"    In his stark earnestness, Link's rough voice sounded more hectoring and  unpleasant than before. Gault, unused to such talk from the alleged  \"peasantry,\" resolved to cut short the haggling.    \"Sell for six hundred a dog that's cleaned up 'best in the show?'\" he  rasped. \"No, thank you. Leighton says Cavalier will go far. One man,  ten minutes ago, offered me a thousand for him.\"    \"A thousan'?\" repeated Ferris, scared at the magnitude of the  sum--then, rallying, he asked:    \"What WILL you let me have him fer, then? Set a price, can't you?\"    \"The dog is not for sale,\" curtly replied Gault, busying himself with  the lighting of a cigarette.    \"Take Mr. Gault's check and go,\" commanded Marden, thrusting the slip  of paper at Link. \"I think there is nothing more to say. I have an  appointment at--\"    He hesitated. Regardless of the others' presence, Ferris dropped to one  knee beside the uncomprehending dog. With his arm about Chum's neck, he  bent close to the collie's ear and whispered:    \"Good-by, Chummie! It's good-by, fer keeps, too. Don't you get to  thinkin' I've gone an' deserted you, nor got tired of you, nor nothnn',  Chum. Because I'd a dam' sight ruther leave one of my two legs here  than to leave you. I--I guess only Gawd rightly knows all you done fer  me, Chum. But I ain't a-goin' to ferget none of it. Lord, but it's  goin' to be pretty turrible, to home, without you!\" He got to his feet,  winking back a mist from his red eyes, and turning blindly toward the  door.    \"Here!\" boomed Marden after him. \"You've forgotten your check.\"    \"I don't aim to take no measly money fer givin' up the only friend I  got!\" snarled Link over his shoulder. \"Keep it--fer a tip!\"    It was a good exit line. But it was spoiled. Because, as Ferris reached  the door and groped for its knob, Chum was beside him--glad to get out  of this uncongenial assembly and to be alone with the master who seemed  so unhappy and so direly in need of consolation. Link stiffened to his  full height. With one hand lovingly laid on the collie's silken head,  he mumbled:    \"No, Chum, you can't come along. Back, boy! Stay HERE!\"    Lowering at Gault, he added:    \"He ain't never been hit, nor yet swore at. An' he don't need to be.  Treat him nice, like he's used to bein' treated. An' don't get sore on  him if he mopes fer me, jes' at fust. Because he's sure to. Dogs ain't  like folks. They got hearts. Folks has only got souls. I guess dogs has  the best of it, at that.\"    Ferris swung open the door and stumbled out, not trusting himself for a  backward glance at the wistfully grieved dog he had left behind.    Lurchingly he made off, across the lawn and out through the wicket. He  was numb and sick. He moved mechanically and with no conscious power of  thought or of locomotion.    Out in the highroad, a homing instinct guided his leaden feet in the  direction of Hampton. And he plodded dazedly the interminable four  miles that separated him from his desolate farm.    As he turned in at his own gate, he was aware of a poignant dread that  pierced his numbness. And he knew it for a dread of entering the house  and of finding no one to welcome him. Setting his teeth he went  forward, unlocked the door and stamped into the silent kitchen.    Upon the table he dumped the paper-swathed cup he had been carrying  unnoticed under his arm. Beside it he threw the little purse full of  gold pieces and the wad of prize ribbons. Stepping back, his foot  struck something. He looked down and saw it was a gay-colored rubber  ball he had bought, months ago, for Chum--the dog's favorite plaything.    His face twisting, Link snatched up the ball and went out onto the  steps to throw it far out of sight; that it might no more remind him of  the pet who had so often coaxed him to toss it for retrieval.    Ferris hurled the ball far out into the garden. As the missile left his  hand an exultant bark re-echoed through the silence of the sunset.  Chum, who had been trotting demurely up the walk, sprang gleefully in  pursuit of the ball, and presently came galloping back to the dazedly  incredulous Link, with the many-colored sphere of rubber between his  jaws.    Chum had had no trouble at all in catching his master's trail and  following it home. He would have overtaken the slow-slouching Ferris,  had he been able to slip out of the clubhouse sooner. And now it  pleased him to be welcomed by this evident invitation to a game of ball.    Link gave a gulping cry and buried both hands in the collie's ruff,  staring"]]]
