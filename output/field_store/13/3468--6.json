It  was renewed at noon, however, when Jerry, Irma, Marjorie and Constance  trooped out of the school building together, a seemingly contented  quartet.    \"Just imagine, girls,\" announced Jerry, excitedly. \"Marjorie doesn't  know a thing about the Hallowe'en party. She hasn't her invitation  either. I think that's awfully queer.\"    \"I haven't mine, but I know all about it,\" put in Constance Stevens,  quietly.    \"Who has charge of the invitations?\" asked Marjorie.    \"Miss Arnold. You'd better see her about yours to-day. Of course you  both want to go.\"    \"But what is it and where is it held?\" questioned Marjorie.    \"It's a big dance. Weston High School, that's the boys' school, gives a  party to Sanford High on every Hallowe'en night. It's a town  institution and as unchangeable as any law the Medes and Persians ever  thought of making,\" informed Jerry.    \"Oh, how splendid!\" exclaimed Marjorie. \"I should like to know some nice  Sanford boys, and I love to dance!\"    \"Then you ought to meet my brother Hal,\" declared Jerry, solemnly, \"for  he's the nicest, handsomest, best boy I know.\"    \"Wait until you see the Crane,\" laughed Irma Linton. \"He's the tallest  boy in high school. He's six feet two inches now. They say he hasn't  stopped growing, either, and he is awfully thin. That's why the boys  call him the 'Crane.' He doesn't mind it a bit. His real name is Sherman  Norwood, but no one ever calls him that except the teachers.\"    During the rest of the walk home the coming dance was the sole subject  under discussion. Yes, the girls wore evening gowns, if they had them.  Lots of girls wore their best summer dresses. The leading caterer of  Sanford always had charge of the refreshments and the boys paid the  bills. There was a real orchestra, too. Of course all the teachers were  there, but the pokey ones went home early and the jolly ones, like Miss  Flint and Miss Atkins, stayed until the last dance.    There were countless other questions to ask, but the luncheon hour was  too short to admit of any lingering on the corner.    \"I wish we had more time to talk,\" sighed Marjorie, reluctantly, as she  came to her street. \"I'd love to hear more about the dance.\"    \"We'll tell you all there is to tell after school,\" promised Jerry. \"Oh,  no, we can't either. You'll have to go to that old basketball practice.  What a nuisance it is. And to think you have to play on the team with  Mignon, Muriel and Susan, after the way they've treated you. Why don't  you resign?\"    \"I don't believe I'll play next term,\" said Marjorie, slowly, \"but I  feel as though I ought to stay on the team for the rest of this term.  Our game with the sophomores is set for two weeks from to-morrow; then,  I believe we are to play against two teams from nearby towns. It  wouldn't be fair to leave the team now, after having practiced with it.\"    \"I don't believe I'd bother my head much about that part of it,\" sniffed  Jerry, \"I'd just quit.\"    \"No, you wouldn't, Geraldine Macy,\" laughed Irma. \"You might grumble,  but you wouldn't be so hateful.\"    \"You don't know how hateful I can be,\" warned Jerry. \"Some other girls  are likely to find out, though.\"    \"Good-bye. I must not stop here another second,\" declared Marjorie.    \"Good-bye!\" floated after her as she walked rapidly toward home.    \"How goes it, Lieutenant?\" asked her father, who, with her mother, was  already seated at the table as she entered the dining-room.    \"Pretty well, thank you, General,\" she replied, touching her hand to her  curly head.    \"I haven't heard you say a word about school for at least a week, my  dear,\" commented her mother. \"Has the novelty of Sanford High worn off  so soon?\"    \"No, indeed, Captain,\" returned Marjorie, earnestly. \"I'm finding out  new things every day.\" She did not add that some of the \"new things\" had  not been agreeable, nor did she volunteer any further information  concerning her school. This touch of reticence on the part of her  usually talkative daughter caused her mother to look at her searchingly  and wonder if Marjorie had something on her mind which in due season  would be brought to light. The subject of the dance returning to the  young girl's thoughts, she began at once to talk of it, and her  enthusiastic description of the coming affair served to allay her  mother's vague impression that Marjorie was not quite happy, and she  entered into the important discussion of what her daughter should wear  with that unselfish interest belonging only to a mother.    When Marjorie returned to school that afternoon she felt happier than  she had been since her advent into Sanford High School. The thought of  the coming dance brought with it a delightful thrill of anticipation.  She had always had such good times at the school dances given by her boy  and her girl chums of B----. She hoped she would enjoy this Hallowe'en  frolic. She wondered if the \"Terrible Trio\" would be there. She smiled  over Jerry's appropriate appellation, then frowned at herself for  countenancing it. Good soldiers didn't indulge in personalities.    That afternoon she found it hard, however, to concentrate her  thoughts on her studies, and when Miss Atkins asked her on what day the  Pilgrim Fathers landed in America, she absent-mindedly replied  \"Hallowe'en,\" to the great joy of her class. During her physiology hour  she managed to keep strictly to the subject; but she was impatient for  the afternoon to pass so that she could go to Miss Arnold for her  invitation.    Her eyes sparkled, however, when, on returning to the study hall, she  saw lying on her desk a square white envelope addressed to her.    \"Oh, here it is,\" she thought delightedly. \"I'm so glad. I wonder if  Constance has hers.\"    She tore open the end of the envelope with eager fingers and drew out a  folded sheet of note paper. But the light died out of her face as she  read:    \"My dear Miss Dean:    \"For some time the members of the freshman team have been dissatisfied  with your playing, and have repeatedly urged me to allow Miss Thornton  to play in your position on the team. Not wishing to seem unfair, Miss  Randall and I watched your work at practice Wednesday afternoon and  agreed that the requested change would be best. As manager of the  freshmen team, their welfare must ever be my first consideration. I  therefore feel no hesitation in asking you for your resignation from the  team.                                        \"Yours sincerely,                                                \"MARCIA ARNOLD.\"    A sigh of humiliation that was half a sob rose to Marjorie's lips. Her  chin quivered ominously. Suddenly a dreadful thought flashed across her  brain. Suppose Mignon and the others were watching her to see how she  received the bad news. Marjorie's desire to cry left her. She leaned  back in her seat and assumed an air of indifference far removed from her  real state of mind. Then she calmly refolded the letter and placed it in  its envelope with the impassivity of a young sphinx.    Later that afternoon, as Mignon La Salle strolled out of school between  her two satellites, Susan and Muriel, she was heard to declare with  disappointed peevishness that that priggish Miss Dean was either too  stupid to resent or too thick-skinned to feel a plain out-and-out snub.          CHAPTER X    A BLUE GOWN AND A SOLEMN RESOLVE      The next day in school was a particularly trying one for poor Marjorie.  It was decidedly hard for the sore-hearted little freshman to believe  that Miss Arnold's motive in asking her to resign from the team had been  purely disinterested. She was reasonably sure that she had Mignon to  blame for the humiliation. Jerry Macy had told her of Miss Arnold's  respect for Mignon's father's money, and that Miss Archer's thin-lipped,  austere-looking secretary was one of the French girl's most devoted  followers.    The wave of dislike which had swept over Marjorie upon first beholding  Marcia Arnold had, as the days passed, intensified rather than lessened.  Jerry, too, could not endure the secretary. \"I never could bear her,\"  she had confided to Marjorie. \"I'm glad she's a junior. I'll have two  years of comfort after she's gone. I suppose she deserves a lot of  credit for keeping up in her studies and earning money as a secretary at  the same time, but I'd rather have a nice wriggly snake, or a cheerful  crocodile for a friend if it comes to a choice.\"    Marjorie was equally certain that Miss Arnold did not like her. She had  had occasion to ask the secretary several questions and the latter's  manner of answering had been curt, almost to rudeness. The desired  resignation was yet to be written. Marjorie had purposely delayed  writing it until the last hour of the afternoon session. She wished to  think before writing. It took her the greater part of the hour to  compose it, although, when it was finally copied on a sheet of note  paper she had brought to school for that purpose, it covered little more  than one side of the sheet.    While she was addressing it for mailing, she suddenly remembered that  she had not yet asked Miss Arnold for her Hallowe'en invitation. Should  she hand the secretary her resignation instead of mailing it? She  decided that the more dignified course would be to mail it. As to the  invitation for the dance, she was entitled to it; therefore she was not  afraid to demand it. She wondered if Constance had received hers, and,  when her new friend returned from class, Marjorie managed to catch her  eye and question her by means of a sign language known only to  schoolgirls. A vigorous shake of Constance's fair head brought forth  more signs, which, when school was dismissed, resulted in a determined  march upon Miss Archer's office by the two friends, reinforced by Jerry  and Irma, who had managed to join Marjorie and Constance in the  corridor.    \"That's just why we waited,\" announced Jerry, wagging her head"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23650"],[0,"Ten Boys from History (#11)"],[1,", and what can _he_ have more but the kingdom?\"    From that moment, Saul was never fond of David, but always bitterly  envious of him, and watched to see how and when he could do the lad an  injury.    The violence of his rage and jealousy threw him into one of his old  paroxysms, and as of old, David was called to soothe him by the music  of his harp. But the sight of David threw Saul into a still worse fever  of madness, and in anger he hurled his spear, the symbol of his  royalty, at David, crying:    \"I will smite David even to the wall with it,\" but David was quick  enough to avoid it, and when at another time Saul attempted the same  thing, David again slipped aside, and the spear simply struck the wall.  This agility of David's made Saul even more angry than before, and  increased his fear of the wonderful youth, whom Saul felt had the  blessing of God, which had been taken from him. So strong was Saul's  dislike of David now, that finally he sent him away from the house,  giving him a position where he would have less influence than formerly,  for he would be only captain over a thousand men, but the new position  only increased David's popularity. He ruled those under him with such  wisdom that all the people loved him, and Saul was, of course, more  jealous and angry than before, and yet afraid of him too, and he began  to think of another way to rid himself of the troublesome rival.    When David had fought Goliath, he was promised the hand of Saul's  eldest daughter in marriage, if he should be victorious, which promise  had not been kept as yet, and now Saul remembered this, and offered to  redeem the promise by giving David his daughter, Merab, as wife, hoping  that in this way, he would not only rouse David's gratitude, but make  him feel in honour bound to fight the Philistines again, for his wife's  sake, and Saul hoped that they might kill him.    Although in our day, David would have been far too young to think of  being married, in those days such things were different, and David  accepted the hand of Merab, but at the last moment, through some new  caprice of Saul's, the promise was broken and Merab became another  man's wife. But Saul's younger daughter, Michal, who had admired  David's behaviour ever since he had been her father's armour-bearer,  was as fond of him as her brother, Jonathan was, and when she told her  father this, he was greatly pleased and said to himself that she should  marry David, who would then fight the Philistines for her sake and be  killed by them. And when David objected to marrying her, saying that it  was no easy matter for a poor man to marry the daughter of a king,  Saul's messengers answered:    \"The King requireth no dowry from him, only that he kill a hundred  Philistines.\"    This pleased David, for he was a born warrior, and he did not know that  the King's purpose in this agreement was to have him fall by the sword  of the enemy. So even before the marriage took place, he was so eager  to fulfil the king's request that he and his men went out and killed  twice as many Philistines as Saul demanded, and came home unhurt, and  although Saul was angry at this, he was obliged to give him Michal in  marriage, but from that moment, Saul hated David more fiercely than  ever, and was determined to kill him, especially when he saw that the  people loved David more and more deeply for his wisdom and bravery.  Intent on this purpose, Saul even called his ministers and servants  together and told them that they must kill David, and he told Jonathan  this too, and Jonathan, loving David as he did, was filled with fear  that his father's wishes would be carried out, and so he hurried to  David with the news of his father's command, and begged David to hide  until the next day, saying that meanwhile he would go to his father and  try to alter his feelings.    When David heard Saul's command, it did not frighten him as much as it  did Jonathan, for he was almost fearless by nature, but he listened to  Jonathan intently, and promised to do what he asked, and as soon as  Jonathan had left him and gone to Saul, David fled to a secret place  and hid there, while Jonathan, having sought his father, began to say  good things about David, even though he saw there was danger of  arousing his father's fierce anger by what he said.    But he spoke boldly, because of his love for David, saying: \"Let not  the King sin against David, because he hath not sinned against thee,  and because his works have been to thee very good. For he did put his  life in his hand and slew the Philistines, and the Lord wrought a great  salvation for all Israel. Thou sawest it and did rejoice, wherefore  then, wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a  cause.\"    It was a brave thing for Jonathan to speak so frankly to his father,  and he would have been more frightened in doing it, had not his love of  David given him courage. And he had his reward, for not only did Saul  listen attentively to him, but was touched by his plea, and when he  finished speaking, swore solemnly:    \"As the Lord liveth, he shall _not_ be slain.\"    Jonathan scarcely waited to hear the words, before he hurried from his  father's presence and ran as fast as he could run to David's  hiding-place to tell him the good news, that he was not to be killed.  And then he insisted that David should go back with him to the king's  court, which David did, and when Saul saw him, old memories stirred in  his heart and he welcomed David affectionately as he had done in times  past.    For a while David remained with Saul and Jonathan and as all went on  peacefully, he and Jonathan had many happy hours together. Then there  was war again with the Philistines, and David was sent out to fight  them, and was again victorious over them, slaying them with such a  great slaughter that those who remained alive fled from him, in fear  and dismay. And although Saul was glad of David's victory over the  enemies of Israel, the old jealousy of his young and powerful rival  again overcame him and he had or pretended to have one of his old  attacks of rage, and as in old times, David was called to soothe his  inflamed spirit. But while he was playing, Saul was filled with jealous  fury, and again hurled his spear at the young musician, and again David  slipped aside and escaped it, and the spear hit the wall instead of his  body--then he fled to his own house, more worried than he had ever been  before; for now he saw clearly that Saul would never give up his  purpose to kill him.    This he told his wife, Michal, who knew her father's cruel, jealous  disposition, even better than Saul did, and was much alarmed for her  husband's safety.    That night, Saul, following out his determination, to rid himself of  David, sent watchers to guard David's house and make sure that he did  not escape in the night, and though they did not go into the house to  kill him at once, because of an old Oriental superstition that only  evil would come to those who entered a home by night, they planned to  enter at daybreak and arrest him.    Michal, with a woman's keen instinct, when she saw the messengers  outside, guessed their purpose and at once she said to David:    \"If thou save not thy life to-night, to-morrow, thou shalt be slain,\"  and then she told David of her plan to save him, which he thought was a  good one. After a hasty farewell, she assisted her husband to escape  through a window on the opposite side of the house from where the  king's messengers were crouched, and David under cover of the darkness  crept stealthily away and escaped once more from Saul's hand. When she  had seen him creep away in the darkness, Michal went back into the  house and dressing up an image, as if it were a man, she laid it in  David's bed, and covered it, head and all, with a long thick coverlet,  and at dawn when Saul's messengers forced an entrance, demanding David,  Michal answered:    \"He is sick.\"    The men went away and told Saul this, but he did not believe it, and  sent them back to bring David to the palace in his bed, if they found  him too sick to walk, and it must have been a moment of triumph for  Michal, who had worked so hard to save her husband's life, and who knew  that he was, even then, far away, when she led Saul's messengers to the  bed, where they found, not their victim, but only an image.    When Saul heard of this, his rage was almost beyond bounds, but Michal  did not care, for she knew that David was safe now, and her answers to  her father's reproaches at her conduct in helping David to escape were  as fearless as possible.    All this took time, and meanwhile, David, now an outcast from his home,  had hurried to Ramah, a city on a height about three miles west of  Gibeah, where he found Samuel at the School of Prophets, and when he  told Samuel all that Saul had done to him, Samuel felt sorely against  Saul, and went with David to Naioth, hoping that they might in that way  escape Saul's messengers, who David knew would surely discover and  follow him. And he was right. No sooner had David reached Ramah than  Saul did find it out, and sent soldiers to arrest him, but three  different bands which he sent, one after another, when they came to the  School of Prophets became filled with religious excitement, and  neglected their errand. Then Saul himself was frenzied with impatience  and started out for Ramah, but before he reached the city, he, too, was  overcome by the spirit of religious excitement, and for a day and a  night forgot his own errand. So David had time to escape, and went  straight back to Saul's court, the place where he had been in such high  favour only a short time before. He went to find Jonathan, his friend,  who had been eagerly waiting for news of him. The meeting of the youths  was a glad one, but there was no time for discussing anything except  what David had come to get advice about. At once he asked"]]]
