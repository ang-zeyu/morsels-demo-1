In that year they were exhumed  and examined, and, after being enclosed in a lead-lined coffin, were  replaced in the tomb, with a parchment giving full details of the  exhumation. Some coins and a ring which were found at this time are  preserved in the Dean and Chapter Library. The inscription previously  quoted was then cut on the upper slab of the tomb.      [6] \"Rites of Durham.\"    In the Galilee Chapel is also the tomb of its restorer, Cardinal  Langley, which was erected by himself in front of the principal altar.  On its head may be seen three shields bearing the arms of the cardinal.    Four of the western windows of the chapel originally contained beautiful  stained glass, a most careful description of which may be found in the  \"Rites of Durham.\"    Why this chapel has always been known as the \"Galilee\" Chapel has been  the subject of much discussion and conjecture, and is still a matter of  uncertainty. That it was erected for a Lady Chapel there can, however,  be no doubt. In the nave of the church, between the piers immediately to  the west of the north and south doorways, the visitor will notice a  dark-coloured marble cross, beyond which no woman was allowed to pass  eastward.    #Monuments in the Nave and Transepts.#--The church of Durham is not  rich in tombs and monuments to the dead. This is to be accounted for  partly by the fact that for some centuries the Bishops of the diocese  were interred in the chapter-house, and even most of these tombs have  been lost or destroyed. Another reason for the scarcity of monuments is  that no layman was allowed to be buried in the church until 1367, when  Lord Ralph Neville obtained that distinction for himself and his wife,  the Lady Alice de Neville, who was buried in 1374. This monument  occupies the third sub-bay from the east, on the south side of the nave.  It is an altar tomb, and though it has suffered severely from mutilation  during the unsettled times of the Reformation, sufficient remains to  enable us to see that it was once a well-designed and noble monument.  Its mouldings are bold, and there are indications of the places where  figures were once attached to the sides. The recumbent effigies of the  noble lord and his wife, on the top of the tomb, are, however,  hopelessly smashed. It is probable that Lord Ralph Neville obtained this  honour for himself through his services and victory at the Battle of  Neville's Cross, near Durham, in 1346. In the next bay westward is the  tomb of Lord John Neville, who died in 1386. This is also an altar tomb,  and has suffered severely, though it remains in a better state of  preservation than the one just described. Its sides each have six  niches, with elaborately ornamented canopies, and containing figures,  while the ends have three similar niches with figures. The carving of  the canopies is exceedingly beautiful. Between each of the niches are  two square panels with trefoiled heads, each panel bearing a shield with  the arms of Neville and Percy. Both above and below the niches much  delicate carving may be noticed. Surmounting all are the broken effigies  of Lord John and his wife, who was the daughter of Lord Henry Percy, the  well-known Hotspur. All the figures on this tomb, including the  recumbent figures, are headless, but sufficient remains to show that  they were of great excellence. Remains of colouring and gilding can also  be distinguished in places on the monument.    Close to this is the slab and matrix of a brass to Robert Neville, who  was bishop of the diocese from 1438 to 1457. The brass has all been  removed, but the matrix shows a dignified figure of the bishop holding a  crozier and a scroll, while an inscription formerly existed on a plate  at his feet. Bishop Neville was known for his generous qualities, as  well as for his high descent.    In the western wall, on its south side, near to the entrance to the  Galilee, is a mural tablet to a former Prebendary in the cathedral, and  a well-known antiquary, Sir George Wheler, who died in the latter part  of the seventeenth century. On the northern side is a slab to the  memory of Captain R.M. Hunter, who was killed while charging a Sikh  battery at Ferozeshah.    Opposite to the monument of Ralph Neville is a modern altar tomb to a  former headmaster of Durham Grammar School, the Rev. James Britton,  D.D., erected by his pupils. It is surmounted by a reclining figure of  Dr. Britton, in academic robes, reading a book.    In the south transept is a fine monument, by Chantrey, to the memory of  Bishop Barrington, who held the see from 1791 to 1826, dying at the  advanced age of 92 years, beloved by all. He was a great prelate, and  used his immense powers as Prince Palatine with great wisdom. The  kneeling figure, with bowed head, the left hand resting on a book, in an  attitude of deep reverence, is worthy of the name of its sculptor. On  the west wall of the same transept is a tablet to the memory of the  officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates of the Durham Light  Infantry who were slain or died during the Crimean War.    Near to this is a recently inserted brass to the memory of the officers  and men of the 2nd Durham Regiment who died in Egypt and the Soudan.    In the north transept we may give some attention to a monument to the  Rev. John Carr, a former headmaster of Durham School. It was erected to  his memory by his pupils. The monument was designed by Rickman, and is  in the style known as Decorated Gothic.    [Illustration: The Font and Cover.]    The #Font# stands at the west end of the nave. It is a comparatively  modern work, covered by a tall wooden canopy which was erected by Bishop  Cosin in 1663. The original Norman font was destroyed by the Scottish  prisoners in 1650, and was replaced by a large marble basin by Bishop  Cosin. This font, in its turn, was removed to Pittington Church, where  it is now in use, its place being filled by the present modern one. It  is designed in the Norman style, and is square, supported on short  columns. The sides are carved with medallions, copied from illuminated  MSS., which represent scenes from the life of S. Cuthbert. The cover  deserves attention as a specimen of the woodwork of the seventeenth  century, exhibiting a curious and characteristic mixture of Classic and  Gothic forms and details.          CHAPTER IV    HISTORY OF THE SEE      The earlier history of the see of Durham has already been referred to in  order to lead up to the founding of the cathedral. We have seen how the  bishop and monks of Lindisfarne fled and wandered with the relics of  their beloved S. Cuthbert, eventually settling at Chester-le-Street,  until, in the year 990, Bishop Aldhun, in terror of the Danes, again  fled southward to Ripon. The country at this time was ruled by that weak  monarch, Ethelred the Unready, and the Danes, finding no determined  opposition, continually made piratical incursions, and eventually,  through the treachery of three chieftains, the Castle of Bamburgh fell  into their hands. After an interval of three or four months peace was  made with the invaders, and Aldhun and his monks ventured to return  towards Chester-le-Street. It was during this journey, at a place called  Wredelau, that the car carrying the saint stuck fast, and the incidents  previously related occurred, which led to the founding of the Bishopric  of Durham.    #Aldhun# may therefore be called the first Bishop of Durham. He held  the see for twenty-nine years, and died in 1018. Aldhun it was who built  the first or White Church, now destroyed. It is extremely probable that  some of the stones of this church were used in the foundations of  Carileph's choir and apses.    After Aldhun's death the see remained vacant for three years, when he  was succeeded by    #Edmund# (1020-1040). It is said that the monks could not agree as to  who should succeed Aldhun, when one day Edmund, a presbyter, asked in a  joke, \"Why not appoint me?\" Being a pious and a faithful man, they took  him at his word, and, after much persuasion and fasting and prayer, he  was consecrated. The choice was a good one. Edmund was an energetic and  beloved prelate. He died at Gloucester in 1041. One of the most  important events during his episcopate was the invasion of Northumbria  by Duncan, King of the Scots. He besieged Durham, but was beaten off,  with great slaughter, and the heads of many of his men were exposed in  the market-place.    #Egelric# (1042-1056) was the next bishop. He was an alien, and made  himself obnoxious to the clergy and people. With the intention of  rebuilding, he pulled down the wooden church at Chester-le-Street, which  had been the seat of the bishopric for one hundred and thirteen years. A  large quantity of treasure was found while digging foundations, and this  Egelric appropriated and sent to his monastery at Peterborough, where he  soon followed it. Before resigning the see of Durham, however, he  secured the appointment of his brother to the bishopric. Some years  later William the Conqueror called him to account for his behaviour in  the matter of the treasure, and threw him into prison at Westminster,  where he died in 1072.    #Egelwin# (1056-1071) succeeded, through the influence of his  brother. He took part in the rebellion of Eadwin and Morcar, and, like  his predecessor, died in prison. He was the last of the Saxon bishops.    #Walcher# (1071-1080). William I. found the Church in great disorder  and made many changes. He filled most of the sees by the appointment of  Norman bishops. To Durham he elected Walcher. The latter was a man of  gentle disposition, but his chaplain, Leobwin, and Gilbert, a kinsman of  his own, to whom he entrusted most of his affairs, were hated by the  people, over whom they exercised great tyranny. At length a noble, named  Lyulph, ventured to remonstrate with them, and in their rage they had  him assassinated. The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20194"],[0,"The Petticoat Commando: Boer Women in Secret Service (#11)"],[1,"were the only consolation one had, became a source of such  keen annoyance and distress that Hansie decided to approach the censor  and ask him the reason for such petty persecutions.    The head censor being away at the time, she was shown into the  presence of a man whose very appearance excited her strongest  antipathy. In the first place he had a purely Dutch name, and she knew  that he could not occupy a position of so much trust under the British  without being a traitor to his own countrymen.    Secondly, he seemed to derive much pleasure from her visit and, when  she told him who she was, had the audacity to say:    \"I always enjoy your letters very much, Miss van Warmelo; they quite  repay me for my trouble!\"    When taxed with confiscating and mutilating them, he was all concern  and innocence personified.    No, indeed, he could never be guilty of such a breach of gallantry and  etiquette, the fault must lie elsewhere; he was her friend, and if she  would promise to bring all her letters to him personally, he would see  that they were passed.    \"Miserable Renegade!\" she thought, with boiling blood.    Instantly it flashed through her mind that it would be foolish indeed  to make an enemy of this man. Her whole manner changed.    \"How _very_ kind of you!\" she said. \"Yes, I shall come myself if you  are sure I shall not be giving you too much trouble.\"    \"A pleasure, I assure you,\" bowing with great gallantry, and Hansie  went home to tell her mother what had happened.    After this interview with the censor, he allowed their letters to pass  with unfailing regularity.    True to her promise, Hansie took her European mail to him herself  every week, and this brought her into contact with him frequently. He  was always affable (hatefully affable) and obliging, and the thought  of this man made it more and more difficult for her to write,  especially those letters destined for the north of Holland.    One day she asked her mother to think of some plan by which she could  use the censor for her own purposes, without his knowledge, and this  set Mrs. van Warmelo's active mind and resourceful brain working, with  what result we shall see in our next chapter.          CHAPTER VIII    OUTWITTING THE CENSOR      If the method of writing between the lines in chemicals presented  itself to Mrs. van Warmelo's mind for a moment, it was dismissed as  too crude and well-known, and, in consequence, too dangerous.    And yet she found her thoughts reverting persistently to chemicals as  the only solution to the problem before her. One day she took the  strained juice of a lemon and wrote a few words with it on a sheet of  white paper. When dry, there was no trace of the written words to be  seen until she had passed a hot iron over them. Imagine her joy and  satisfaction when they showed up clear and distinct, in a colour of  yellowish brown. Well satisfied with her experiment, she sought and  found a square white envelope of thick paper and good quality, which  she carefully opened out, by inserting and rolling the thin end of a  penholder along the part that was glued. Spreading the envelope before  her on the table, she wrote some sentences in lemon juice on the  _inside_, folding it into shape again and pasting it down with great  care and neatness. This envelope she placed in Hansie's hands, with an  expectant look, when the latter came home that afternoon.    Hansie turned it over, examined it on all sides and shook her head,  puzzled.    \"Open it,\" her mother suggested, \"and look inside.\"    Hansie opened it and, peering into it, shook her head again, more  mystified than ever.    \"I give it up, mother,\" she said. \"Come, don't be so mysterious--tell  me what it all means.\"    Mrs. van Warmelo then took the envelope, opened it with the penholder  again, and, producing the hot iron which she had been keeping in  readiness for the psychological moment, she ironed out the flattened  sheet and revealed to the astonished gaze of her daughter the written  words within.    At first Hansie was speechless with admiration; then she threw her  arms round her mother and hugged her vigorously.    \"Really, mother,\" she exclaimed, \"I am proud of you. How we shall be  able to dupe 'Miserable Renegade' now!\"    The full importance of this discovery was not realised at the time,  for all their smuggling had hitherto been carried on merely for  pleasure and they had had no information of any importance to  communicate to their friends across the seas; but, in the light of  after-events, they realised that they had been led to make their  preparations and to have their methods in full working order before  the time came to use them in conveying dispatches from the Boer Secret  Service to President Kruger in Holland.    They were now in the possession of a scheme which defied detection,  and the next thing to be done was to inform some distant conspirator  of this valuable discovery and instruct him in the use of it.    That this could not be done through the post, my reader will  understand, and as reliable opportunities were becoming more rare,  Hansie had to wait some months and to possess her soul in patience  until at last some trusted friend, leaving the country, could be  persuaded to convey the important instructions.    When and how they were eventually sent I cannot tell with positive  certainty. There is a difference of opinion on this point between Mrs.  van Warmelo and her daughter, and there is no way of settling the  dispute, because Hansie's diary contains no word about the White  Envelope, for reasons which it will hardly be necessary to explain.    Mrs. van Warmelo says the instructions were dispatched in a false  double-bottom of an ordinary safety match-box. Hansie thinks they were  either hidden behind a photo-frame or in a tin of insect-powder, both  these methods having been employed on various occasions, but at  present we are only concerned with the fact that the instructions  reached their destination safely, and from that day until the end of  the war a gloriously free and uninterrupted communication was kept up  between Harmony and Alphen and one spot in the north of Holland, of  which we shall hear more as our story unfolds itself.    Further experimenting showed that the lemon-juice became visible after  a few days when written on certain papers, while on others there was  nothing to be seen after many weeks, and this danger was immediately  communicated to Holland as a very serious one, for it stands to reason  that the danger connected with the sending of the White Envelope  _from_ South Africa was nothing compared to the danger of receiving  one and having it censored three weeks after it had been written.    One had to keep in mind that letters leaving the country would be  censored immediately and would not be subjected to further scrutiny in  Europe, whereas letters for South Africa ran every risk of being  betrayed on examination, after a three-weeks' journey by land and sea.    When the smuggled instructions were well on their way, the first White  Envelope was written to Holland, and carelessly thrust amongst a pile  of other letters by the quaking Hansie when next she handed her mail  to \"Miserable Renegade.\"    He glanced through them all without examining them, merely putting the  mark of the censor on them and assuring Hansie that they would be  forwarded that very day.    No seven weeks could have been longer or more full of suspense than  those which followed, and the excitement at Harmony when in due time a  square white envelope in the well-known hand arrived from Holland can  better be imagined than described.    With what anxiety it was opened and how eagerly examined before the  hot iron was applied! how keen the delight when nothing legible was  found, even on the closest inspection! What relief, at last, when the  written messages became not only legible, but clear and distinct!    So this method was going to answer beyond their wildest expectations!    To make assurance doubly sure, and because Hansie did not trust  \"Miserable Renegade\" one jot, she sometimes made use of friends, going  to Johannesburg, to post her White Envelope there, giving as her  reason for doing so the difficulties she had had with the Pretoria  censor.    Of course the secret of the White Envelope was not confided even to  her most intimate friends.    This correspondence having been fairly established, there was nothing  to prevent Hansie from using the European mail every week; but to  avoid needless risks and the possible exposure of the valuable secret,  it was agreed to use it only in cases of extreme necessity.    The sign of the White Envelope became an understood thing between the  conspirators, and for all other correspondence grey and coloured  envelopes were used.    The correspondent in the north of Holland was a young minister of the  Gospel who had taken for years an unusual interest in Hansie's career.    At this point of our story the two young people, after some years of  estrangement, brought about by an unfortunate misunderstanding on his  part, pride and self-will on hers, had reached the delightfully  unsettling stage of exchanging photographs, the sequel of which took  place under the most romantic circumstances, not to be related in this  volume.    \"It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good,\" the young man must  often have thought, as he faithfully carried out every instruction  from the scene of action.    All communications for the President and Dr. Leyds were sent to him  (through the White Envelope), because it was not considered safe to  correspond with them direct, even through the medium of the  lemon-juice discovery.    As time went on, this method of communication was used for many  purposes and always with success, but some time after the war, when it  was Hansie's right and privilege to go through the war correspondence  of the young minister of religion, she"]]]
