They  are outside the grip of reality, and constitute a world which becomes,  for any one with the smallest imagination, as great and as important  as the world called real. One may call in evidence the poets,  novelists, artists, and the dreamers of all kinds. When life becomes  too hard for us, we fly to the ideal world, there to seek  forgetfulness or compensation.    It is, therefore, easy to understand, that it should have been  proposed to carry into ideation the dichotomy between the physical and  the moral. Many excellent authors have made the domain of the mind  begin in the ideal. Matter is that which does not think. Descartes, in  his _Discours de la Methode_ (4th part), remarking that he may pretend  \"not to have a body, and that there is no world or place in which he  exists, but that he cannot pretend that he does not think,\" concludes  by saying that the mind is \"a substance, all whose essence or nature  is merely to think, and which has no need of either place or any other  material thing, in order to exist;\" in short, that \"the soul is  absolutely distinct from the body.\"[19]    Let us, then, examine in what measure this separation between  perception and ideation can be legitimately established. If we accept  this separation, we must abandon the distinction I proposed between  acts and objects of cognition, or, at least, admit that this  distinction does not correspond to that between the physical and the  moral, since thoughts, images, recollections, and even the most  abstract conceptions, all constitute, in a certain sense, objects of  cognition. They are phenomena which, when analysed, are clearly  composed of two parts, an object and a cognition. Their logical  composition is, indeed, that of an external perception, and there is  in ideation exactly the same duality as in sensation. Consequently, if  we maintain the above distinction as a principle of classification for  all knowable phenomena, we shall be obliged to assign the same  position to ideas as to sensations.    The principal difference we notice between sensation and idea is, it  would seem, the character of unreality in the last named; but this  opposition has not the significance we imagine. Our mental vision  only assumes this wholly special character of unreality under  conditions in which it is unable to harmonise with the real vision.  Taine has well described the phases of the reduction of the image by  sensation: it is at the moment when it receives the shock of an image  which contradicts it, that the image appears as illusory.[20] Let us  suppose that we are sitting down dreaming and watching the passing by  of our images. If, at this moment, a sudden noise calls us back to  reality, the whole of our mental phantasmagoria disappears as if by  the wave of a magic wand, and it is by thus vanishing that the image  shows its falsity. It is false because it does not accord with the  present reality.    But, when we do not notice a disagreement between these two modes of  cognition, both alike give us the impression of reality. If I evoke a  reminiscence and dwell attentively on the details, I have the  impression that I am in face of the reality itself. \"I feel as if I  were there still,\" is a common saying; and, among the recollections I  evoke, there are some which give me the same certitude as the  perception of the moment. Certain witnesses would write their  depositions with their blood. One does not see this every day; but  still one does see it.    Further, there are thousands of circumstances where the ideation is  neither in conflict with the perception nor isolated from it, but in  logical continuity with it. This continuity must even be considered as  the normal condition. We think in the direction of that which we  perceive. The image seems to prepare the adaptation of the individual  to his surroundings; it creates the foresight, the preparation of the  means, and, in a word, everything which constitutes for us a final  cause. Now, it is very necessary that the image appear real to be  usefully the substitute of the sensation past or to come.    Let us establish one thing more. Acting as a substitute, the image not  only appears as real as the sensation, it appears to be of the same  nature; and the proof is that they are confounded one with the other,  and that those who are not warned of the fact take one for the other.  Every time a body is perceived, as I previously explained, there are  images which affix themselves to the sensation unnoticed. We think we  perceive when we are really remembering or imagining. This addition of  the image to the sensation is not a petty and insignificant accessory;  it forms the major part, perhaps nine-tenths, of perception. Hence  arise the illusions of the senses, which are the result, not of  sensations but of ideas. From this also comes the difficulty of  knowing exactly what, under certain circumstances, is observation or  perception, where the fact perceived ends, and where conjecture  begins. Once acquainted with all these possibilities of errors, how  can we suppose a radical separation between the sensation and the  image?    Examined more closely, images appear to us to be divisible into as  many kinds as sensations: visual images correspond to visual  sensations, tactile to tactile, and so on with all the senses.    That which we experience in the form of sensation, we can experience  over again in the form of image, and the repetition, generally weaker  in intensity and poorer in details, may, under certain favourable  circumstances, acquire an exceptional intensity, and even equal  reality: as is shown by hallucinations. Here, certainly, are very  sound reasons for acknowledging that the images which are at the  bottom of our thoughts, and form the object of them, are the  repetition, the modification, the transposition, the analysis or the  synthesis of sensations experienced in the past, and possessing, in  consequence, all the characteristics of bodily states. I believe that  there is neither more nor less spirituality in the idea than in the  sensation. That which forms its spirituality is the implied act of  cognition; but its object is material.    I foresee a final objection: I shall be told that even when the  unreality of the image is not the rule, and appears only under certain  circumstances, it nevertheless exists. This is an important fact. It  has been argued from the unreality of dreams and hallucinations in  which we give a body to our ideas, that we do not in reality perceive  external bodies, but simply psychical states and modifications of our  souls. If our ideas consist--according to the hypothesis I uphold--in  physical impressions which are felt, we shall be told that these  particular impressions must participate in the nature of everything  physical; that they are real, and always real; that they cannot be  unreal, fictitious, and mendacious, and that, consequently, the  fictitious character of ideation becomes inexplicable.    Two words of answer are necessary to this curious argument, which is  nothing less than an effort to define the mental by the unreal, and to  suppose that an appearance cannot be physical. No doubt, we say, every  image, fantastical as it may seem as signification, is real in a  certain sense, since it is the perception of a physical impression;  but this physical nature of images does not prevent our making a  distinction between true and false images. To take an analogous  example: we are given a sheet of proofs to correct, we delete certain  redundant letters, and, although they are printed with the same type  as the other letters, we have the right to say they are false. Again,  in a musical air, we may hear a false note, though it is as real as  the others, since it has been played. This distinction between reality  and truth ought to be likewise applied to mental images. All are real,  but some are false. They are false when they do not accord with the  whole reality; they are true when they agree; and every image is  partly false because, being an image, it does not wholly accord with  the actual perceptions. It creates a belief in a perception which does  not occur; and by developing these ideas we could easily demonstrate  how many degrees of falsehood there are.    Physiologically, we may very easily reconcile the falsity of the image  with the physical character of the impression on which it is based.  The image results from a partial cerebral excitement, which sensation  results from an excitement which also acts upon the peripheral sensory  nerves, and corresponds to an external object--an excitant which the  image does not possess. This difference explains how it is that the  image, while resulting from a physical impression, may yet be in a  great number of cases declared false--that is to say, may be  recognised as in contradiction to the perceptions.    To other minds, perhaps, metaphysical reasoning will be more  satisfactory. For those, we propose to make a distinction between two  notions, Existence or Reality, on the one hand, and Truth, on the  other.    Existence or Reality is that of which we have an immediate  apprehension. This apprehension occurs in several ways. In perception,  in the first place. I perceive the reality of my body, of a table, the  sky, the earth, in proportion to my perception of them. They exist,  for if they did not, I could not perceive them. Another way of  understanding reality is conception or thought. However much I may  represent a thing to myself as imaginary, it nevertheless exists in a  certain manner, since I can represent it to myself. I therefore, in  this case, say that it is real or it exists.

The eccentric-strap and flywheel are cast iron, and the other  portions of the engine are of brass. The screw threads are all  chased, and the flange, a, and head of the piston, F, in addition to  being screwed, are further secured by soft solder.    Fig. 1 shows the engine in perspective. Fig 2 is a side elevation,  with parts broken away. Fig. 3 is a vertical transverse section.  Fig. 4 is a partial plan view. Fig. 5 is a detail view of the upper  end of the connecting rod and its connections; and Fig. 6 is a  horizontal section taken through the middle of the valve chamber.    The cylinder, A, is threaded externally for 1 inch from its lower  end, and the collar, a, 1/4 inch thick, is screwed on and soldered.  The face of the collar is afterward turned true. The same thread  answers for the nut which clamps the cylinder in the plate, B, and  for the gland, b, of the stuffing box, which screws over the beveled  end of the cylinder, and contains fibrous packing filled with  asbestos or graphite. The posts, C, are shouldered at the ends and  secured in their places by nuts. Their bearing surface on the plate,  D, is increased by the addition of a collar screwed on. The posts  are made from drawn rods of brass, and need no turning except at the  ends.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--SIMPLE SINGLE-ACTING STEAM ENGINE]    The cylinder head, E, which is a casting containing the valve  chamber, is screwed in. The piston, F, fits the cylinder closely,  but not necessarily steam tight. The head is screwed in and  soldered, and the yoke, G, which receives the connecting rod pin, is  screwed into the head. The connecting rod, H, is of steel with brass  ends. The lower end, which receives the crank pin, is split, and  provided with a tangent screw for taking up wear. The crank pin is  secured in the crank disk, I, by a nut on the back. The eccentric  rod, J, is of steel, screwed at its lower end into an eccentric  strap of cast or wrought iron, which surrounds the eccentric, K. The  valve, L, is slotted in the back to receive the valve spindle, by  which it is oscillated. The ports are formed by drilling from the  outside, and afterward forming the slot, with a graver or small  sharp chisel. The supply port, for convenience, may be somewhat  enlarged below. The holes for the exhaust port will be drilled  through the hole into which the exhaust pipe is screwed. The chamber  communicating with the exhaust is cored out in the casting.    The easiest way to make the valve is to cut it out of a solid  cylinder turned to fit the valve chamber.    An engine of this kind will work well under a steam pressure of 50  lb., and it may be run at the rate of 200 to 250 revolutions per  minute.    [Illustration: SIDE ELEVATION.

The object of this invention is to furnish finger  rings so constructed that they can be opened out to represent  serpents, and which, when being worn, will give no indication of  being anything more than rings.    An improved heel skate-fastener has been patented by Mr. Elijah S.  Coon, of Watertown, N.Y. This invention consists, essentially, of a  screw threaded hollow plug or thimble, a dirt plate for covering the  opening in the plug, and a spring for holding the dirt plate in  place. This fastener possesses several advantages over one that is  permanently attached to the heel. Being cylindrical, it is more  easily connected, because the hole for its reception can be made  with a common auger or bit without the necessity for lasting the  boot or shoe or using a knife or chisel. Being screw threaded it can  be readily screwed into place with a common screwdriver; this also  enables it to be screwed either in or out, in order to make it fit  the heel key. The screw thread permits of screwing it in beyond the  surface of the heel, so as to prevent it from wearing out by the  ordinary wearing of the shoe.    An improved velocipede has been patented by Messrs. Charles E.  Tripler and William H. Roff, of New York city. The object of this  invention is to obtain a more advantageous application of the  propelling power than the ordinary cranks, to avoid the noise of  pawls and ratchets, and to guard the velocipedes against being  overturned should one of the rear wheels pass over an obstruction.    Mr. Philip H. Pax on, of Camden, N. J., has patented a machine that  will cut lozenges in a perfect manner, and will not be clogged by  the gum and sugar of the lozenge dough.    Mr. John H. Robertson, of New York city, has patented an improved  mat, which consists of longitudinal metal bars provided with  alternate mortised and tenoned ends, and composed of series of  sockets united by webs and of wooden transverse rods entered through  said sockets and held therein by vertical pins.    Mr. Charles F. Clapp, of Ripon, Wis, has patented a novel  arrangement of a desk attachment for trunks. The desk and tray may  be lifted from the trunk when the desk is either raised or lowered.    A combined scraper, chopper, and dirter has been patented by Messrs.  Francis A. Hall and Nathaniel B. Milton, of Monroe, La. The object  of this invention is to furnish an implement so constructed as to  bar off a row of plants, chop the plants to a stand, and dirt the  plants at one passage along the row, and which shall be simple,  convenient, and reliable.    Mr. Hermann H. Cammann, of New York city, has patented a basket so  constructed that it can be compactly folded for transportation or  storage.    Messrs. David H. Seymour and Henry R. A. Boys, of Barrie, Ontario,  Canada, have patented an improvement in that class of devices that  are designed to be applied to steam cylinders for introducing oil or  tallow into the cylinder and upon the cylinder valves. It consists  of an oil cup provided with a gas escape, a scum breaker, an  interior gauge, and an adjustable feed pipe extension.    Mr. John H. Conrad, of Charlotte, Mich., has patented a portable  sliding gate which will dispense with hinges and which can be used  in any width of opening. It may be readily connected with a  temporary opening or gap made in the fence.    An improved reversible pole and shaft for vehicles has been  patented by Mr. Francis M. Heuett, of Jug Tavern, Ga. The object of  this invention is to so combine the parts of shafts for vehicles  that they may be readily transposed and re-employed to form the  tongue without removing the thill arms or hounds from the Mr.  William Jones, of Kalamazoo, Mich., has patented an improved box  which is useful for various purposes, but is particularly intended  for shipping fourth class mail matter. The feature of special  novelty is the means of fastening the hinged cover.    Mr. Louis J. Halbert, of Brooklyn, N. Y., has patented an improved  slate cleaner, which is simple, convenient, and effective.    An improved boot, which is simple in its make, fits well, and is  convenient to put on and take off, has been patented by Ellene A.  Bailey, of St. Charles, Mo. The boot is provided with side seams,  one of which is open at its lower end, and is provided with lacing,  buttons, or a like device, so that it can be closed when the boot is  on the wearer's foot.           *       *       *       *       *          THE HERCULES BEETLE.      In the handsome engraving herewith are shown the male and female of  the Hercules beetle (_Dynastes hercules_) of Brazil. The family of  the _Dynastidae_ comprises some of the largest and most beautiful of  the beetle race, and all of them are remarkable for enormous  developments of the thorax and head. They are all large bodied and  stout limbed, and by their great strength abundantly justify their  generic name, _Dynastes_, which is from the Greek and signifies  powerful. The larvae of these beetles inhabit and feed upon decaying  trees and other rotting vegetable matter, and correspond in size  with the mature insects. Most of them inhabit tropical regions,  where they perform a valuable service in hastening the destruction  of dead or fallen timber.    An admirable example of this family of beetles is the one here  represented. In the male of the Hercules beetle the upper part of  the thorax is prolonged into a single, downward curving horn fully  three inches long, the entire length of the insect being about six  inches. The head is prolonged into a similar horn, which curves  upward, giving the head and thorax"]]]
