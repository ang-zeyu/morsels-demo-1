The east  window of this chancel is a very good one, it is of five lights, and  the tracery is very beautiful, though of a description not at all  uncommon; in fact most of the Decorated windows in parish churches  throughout Northamptonshire, which have any pretensions to size or  beauty, have their tracery of this form, as, for instance, the east  window of Higham Ferrers church, and many others. Above this window is  an elegant pierced cross, probably of the same date as the window  itself. The parapet of this chancel has nothing worthy of notice about  it; it is like the rest of the building, of plain Late Decorated  character.\"    [Sidenote: Palace Gateway.]    On the right of us, is the magnificent gateway which leads to the  bishop's palace, over which is a chamber, called the knights' chamber.  \"This gateway is of somewhat peculiar Early English character, having a  fine groined roof, springing from very beautiful clustered shafts. A  line of arches, each of which contain within them two smaller arches,  continues along either side of the interior; which is entered on the  north and south sides, through fine and lofty arches supported by  clustered columns. The bases of all these columns, like those of many  others about the remains of this abbey, are covered with soil which the  lapse of years has caused to accumulate around them; this of course  much diminishes the height of each shaft. This beautiful gateway is  flanked at its angles by square turrets, each ornamented, as also is  the apex of the gable, with a fine niche, which has within it a figure  of an unusually large size. The niches on the south side, contain the  figures of St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. Andrew; those on the north,  contain the representations of King Edward II., Abbot Godfrey de  Croyland, and the Prior of the Abbey of that time, in full Benedictine  costume.    [Sidenote: West Front.]    \"The splendid front of the building is the most interesting and  important of its members. This beautiful and original composition  cannot fail to strike the mind of the beholder with awe and admiration;  the first sight of it usually makes an impression on the memory which  is not easily obliterated. It is indeed one of the finest specimens  which the universe can produce, of the Pointed style of architecture.  As a west front, scarcely any in this kingdom can be brought into  comparison with it for beauty of proportion, and elegance of design.  The west fronts of the cathedrals of Wells, York, and Lichfield have  been mentioned as surpassing it in some respects; and in point of  richness of detail, the two first may be perhaps considered as superior  to it; but they all of them fall far short of Peterborough in the  grandeur of their general effect.    \"The outline of this front forms a regular square of 156 feet, that  being the height of the side spires, and also the extreme width of the  building. Its plan consists of three lofty arches of the same height,  of which that in the middle is considerably the narrowest, the two side  ones being of equal dimensions. These rest on triangular piers faced  with shafts. At either extremity of this arcade are two lofty turrets,  flanked at the angles by clustered columns, instead of buttresses,  which run the whole height of the turrets. These turrets connect the  arcade with the western wall of the church, from which it is distant  fifteen feet, which gives the appearance of great depth and beauty to  the arches.\" [_Davys' Guide._]    \"There was, perhaps little or no interval between the completion of the  nave in the Circular style of architecture, and the erection of the  north-west tower, in the Lancet, or first style of the Pointed. The  original plan of the front, like that of Lincoln, comprised, no doubt,  two towers rising at the western extremity of the side aisles of the  nave, having a Norman base with circular lights, and an additional  transept, projecting north and south beyond the line of the side  aisles. But before this design could be carried into execution,  architecture itself had undergone a change; pointed arches were  substituted for circular ones, and slender isolated columns for the  clustered shaft, or solid cylinder. Hence the difference in style of  the tower just referred to: the string moulding at the base of it,  together with the superstructure, and the pinnacles and pediment which  surmount the adjacent transept, being all of a later order than the  work of the nave: and hence also the union of both styles in the  transept itself--its lofty arches, parallel to the side walls, being  highly pointed, but with the zigzag ornament, and resting on Norman  shafts; and the doorways of the front having circular heads, in  accommodation to the arches of the nave, but with pointed mouldings and  pillars.    \"The tower, towards the south, appears never to have been finished,  although unquestionably included in the architect's design. The present  base, above the transept, is of a comparatively modern date, and  altogether inferior to the work of the north-west tower. In the  progress of great undertakings it not unfrequently happens that fresh  objects present themselves to the mind, which at first were not thought  of. Such appears to have been the case in respect of this cathedral,  the architect of which, while completing the front, seems to have  caught a new idea--that of erecting two lofty turrets beyond the outer  angles of the transept, towards the west, and of converting the  intermediate space into a sort of piazza, by arches constructed in  front of the nave and closed in above by a vaulted roof. This idea so  unique and at the same time so splendid, he was enabled to realize: and  posterity, at the distance of six centuries, beholds with ineffable  delight and admiration, a composition, the outlines and details of  which, for their beauty and variety, render it one of the noblest  facades in existence. Towards the north and south are two lofty  turrets, flanked at the angles by clustered shafts, rising from a  projecting base and crowned with spires, the height of which from the  ground, makes a square with the breadth of the front. The space between  these turrets is occupied by three pointed arches, reaching the whole  height of the upper walls of the nave, and resting on triangular piers,  which are faced with clustered shafts like those of the turrets, and  terminate in octangular pinnacles, resting each upon a square basement,  and divided by a moulding into two stages, the upper one of which is  perforated with narrow lights, edged with the dog-toothed quatrefoil.  The sides of the pier are lined with isolated columns in channelled  recesses, each column sustaining a ribbed moulding of the arch above,  and the whole series being finished with interlaced and foliated  capitals.    \"The centre arch is narrower than the outer ones, the reason of which  will appear when we look at the situation of the doorways opening into  the side aisles of the nave. Had the architect designed the three  arches of equal breadth, the piers which sustain the centre arch must  have stood immediately in front of these door-ways, or the outer arches  must have been so contracted as to bring the turrets within the line of  the transept, and thereby conceal, in part at least, the towers behind.    \"This circumstance of itself shows that the turrets, piers, and arches,  as they now exist, formed no part of the original plan. The interstices  between the pillars which sustain the centre arch differ from those of  the outer arches, in that they are chequered at regular distances with  clumps of foliage, as if exuberance of ornament were designed to  compensate for inequality in other respects. This inequality has been  still further obviated by the erection of a porch, which, after a  minute inspection, appears to have been inserted by way of support to  the central piers, both of which had previously swerved from the  perpendicular, as may still be seen. Over each arch rises a lofty  pediment, bounded by the wave and billet ornaments, and surmounted by a  perforated cross. The spandrils formed by the base of the pediment and  the arches beneath, severally contain, first, a deeply recessed  quatrefoil, above this two trefoil arches, and still higher two pointed  arches, resting on slender pillars, and filled with statues,--and also  a hexagon, the featherings of which clasp a human head.    \"The pediments contain each a large circular light, with other  apertures and niches. The circle of the central pediment is divided by  mullions into eight lights, under trefoil arches radiating from an orb.  Those on the sides are divided into six lights, the featherings of  which are very beautiful. The mullions, or radii, are all faced with  small pillars and capitals, and lined with the dog-toothed quatrefoil.  The outer moulding of the central circle is composed of closely  compacted trefoils, that of the others has the wave ornament. At the  base of each circle is a series of trefoil arches, rested on isolated  columns, four of which admit light into an apartment above the  vaulting, and three contain statues. The intermediate spaces formed by  the circle and the pediment, contain two niches, one on each side and  another above, all filled with statues. The niche in the apex of the  central pediment contains a statue, apparently of St. Peter,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2097"],[0,"The Sign of the Four (#11)"],[1,"vanished once more upon  the opposite side.  When I made my way round there I found him seated  at one of the corner eaves.    \"That you, Watson?\" he cried.    \"Yes.\"    \"This is the place.  What is that black thing down there?\"    \"A water-barrel.\"    \"Top on it?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"No sign of a ladder?\"    \"No.\"    \"Confound the fellow!  It's a most break-neck place.  I ought to be  able to come down where he could climb up.  The water-pipe feels pretty  firm.  Here goes, anyhow.\"    There was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern began to come steadily  down the side of the wall.  Then with a light spring he came on to the  barrel, and from there to the earth.    \"It was easy to follow him,\" he said, drawing on his stockings and  boots.  \"Tiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry he  had dropped this.  It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it.\"    The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out  of colored grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it.  In  shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside were half a  dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other,  like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto.    \"They are hellish things,\" said he.  \"Look out that you don't prick  yourself.  I'm delighted to have them, for the chances are that they  are all he has.  There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our  skin before long.  I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself.  Are  you game for a six-mile trudge, Watson?\"    \"Certainly,\" I answered.    \"Your leg will stand it?\"    \"Oh, yes.\"    \"Here you are, doggy!  Good old Toby!  Smell it, Toby, smell it!\" He  pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog's nose, while the  creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical  cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of a famous  vintage.  Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a  stout cord to the mongrel's collar, and led him to the foot of the  water-barrel.  The creature instantly broke into a succession of high,  tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the  air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and  kept us at the top of our speed.    The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some  distance in the cold gray light.  The square, massive house, with its  black, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn,  behind us.  Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among  the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected.  The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs,  had a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy  which hung over it.    On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly,  underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a  young beech.  Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been  loosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the  lower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder.  Holmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over  upon the other side.    \"There's the print of wooden-leg's hand,\" he remarked, as I mounted up  beside him.  \"You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white  plaster.  What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain  since yesterday!  The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their  eight-and-twenty hours' start.\"    I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great  traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval.  My  fears were soon appeased, however.  Toby never hesitated or swerved,  but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion.  Clearly, the pungent  smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents.    \"Do not imagine,\" said Holmes, \"that I depend for my success in this  case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot  in the chemical.  I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace  them in many different ways.  This, however, is the readiest and, since  fortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected  it.  It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty  little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There  might have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too  palpable clue.\"    \"There is credit, and to spare,\" said I.  \"I assure you, Holmes, that I  marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even  more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me to  be deeper and more inexplicable.  How, for example, could you describe  with such confidence the wooden-legged man?\"    \"Pshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself.  I don't wish to be  theatrical.  It is all patent and above-board.  Two officers who are in  command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried  treasure.  A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan  Small.  You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain  Morstan's possession.  He had signed it in behalf of himself and his  associates,--the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called  it.  Aided by this chart, the officers--or one of them--gets the  treasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some  condition under which he received it unfulfilled.  Now, then, why did  not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself?  The answer is obvious.  The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close  association with convicts.  Jonathan Small did not get the treasure  because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not  get away.\"    \"But that is mere speculation,\" said I.    \"It is more than that.  It is the only hypothesis which covers the  facts.  Let us see how it fits in with the sequel.  Major Sholto  remains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his  treasure.  Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great  fright.  What was that?\"    \"A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.\"    \"Or had escaped.  That is much more likely, for he would have known  what their term of imprisonment was.  It would not have been a surprise  to him.  What does he do then?  He guards himself against a  wooden-legged man,--a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white  tradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him.  Now, only one  white man's name is on the chart.  The others are Hindoos or  Mohammedans.  There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with  confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small.  Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty?\"    \"No:  it is clear and concise.\"    \"Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us  look at it from his point of view.  He comes to England with the double  idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having  his revenge upon the man who had wronged him.  He found out where  Sholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with some  one inside the house.  There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not  seen.  Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could  not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever  knew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died.  Suddenly  Small learns that the major is on his death-bed.  In a frenzy lest the  secret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the  guards, makes his way to the dying man's window, and is only deterred  from entering by the presence of his two sons.  Mad with hate, however,  against the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his  private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to  the treasure, and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short  inscription upon the card.  He had doubtless planned beforehand that  should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body  as a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view  of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice.  Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the  annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the  criminal.  Do you follow all this?\"    \"Very clearly.\"    \"Now, what could Jonathan Small do?  He could only continue to keep a  secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he  leaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the  discovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it.  We again  trace the presence of some confederate in the household.  Jonathan,  with his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of  Bartholomew Sholto.  He takes with him, however, a rather curious  associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into  creasote, whence comes Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer  with a damaged tendo Achillis.\"    \"But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.\"    \"Quite so.  And rather to Jonathan's disgust, to judge by the way he  stamped about when he got into the room.  He bore no grudge against  Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been  simply bound and gagged.  He did not wish to put his head in a halter.  There was no help for it, however:  the savage instincts of his  companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work:  so  Jonathan Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground,  and followed it himself.  That was the train of events as far as I can  decipher them.  Of course as to his personal appearance he must be  middle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an  oven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length  of his stride, and we know that he"]]]
