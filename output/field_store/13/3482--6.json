A feeble version read below,  A print without the picture's grace,  Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score  Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.      Tattiana's Letter to Oneguine    I write to you! Is more required?  Can lower depths beyond remain?  'Tis in your power now, if desired,  To crush me with a just disdain.  But if my lot unfortunate  You in the least commiserate  You will not all abandon me.  At first, I clung to secrecy:  Believe me, of my present shame  You never would have heard the name,  If the fond hope I could have fanned  At times, if only once a week,  To see you by our fireside stand,  To listen to the words you speak,  Address to you one single phrase  And then to meditate for days  Of one thing till again we met.  'Tis said you are a misanthrope,  In country solitude you mope,  And we--an unattractive set--  Can hearty welcome give alone.  Why did you visit our poor place?  Forgotten in the village lone,  I never should have seen your face  And bitter torment never known.  The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down  By time (who can anticipate?)  I had found my predestinate,  Become a faithful wife and e'en  A fond and careful mother been.    Another! to none other I  My heart's allegiance can resign,  My doom has been pronounced on high,  'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.  The sum of my existence gone  But promise of our meeting gave,  I feel thou wast by God sent down  My guardian angel to the grave.  Thou didst to me in dreams appear,  Unseen thou wast already dear.  Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,  I heard thy voice's resonance  Long ago. Dream it cannot be!  Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,  I flushed up, stupefied I grew,  And cried within myself: 'tis he!  Is it not truth? in tones suppressed  With thee I conversed when I bore  Comfort and succour to the poor,  And when I prayer to Heaven addressed  To ease the anguish of my breast.  Nay! even as this instant fled,  Was it not thou, O vision bright,  That glimmered through the radiant night  And gently hovered o'er my head?  Was it not thou who thus didst stoop  To whisper comfort, love and hope?  Who art thou? Guardian angel sent  Or torturer malevolent?  Doubt and uncertainty decide:  All this may be an empty dream,  Delusions of a mind untried,  Providence otherwise may deem--  Then be it so! My destiny  From henceforth I confide to thee!  Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour  And thy protection I implore.  Imagine! Here alone am I!  No one my anguish comprehends,  At times my reason almost bends,  And silently I here must die--  But I await thee: scarce alive  My heart with but one look revive;  Or to disturb my dreams approach  Alas! with merited reproach.    'Tis finished. Horrible to read!  With shame I shudder and with dread--  But boldly I myself resign:  Thine honour is my countersign!    XXXIV    Tattiana moans and now she sighs  And in her grasp the letter shakes,  Even the rosy wafer dries  Upon her tongue which fever bakes.  Her head upon her breast declines  And an enchanting shoulder shines  From her half-open vest of night.  But lo! already the moon's light  Is waning. Yonder valley deep  Looms gray behind the mist and morn  Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn  Arouses rustics from their sleep.  'Tis day, the family downstairs,  But nought for this Tattiana cares.    XXXV    The break of day she doth not see,  But sits in bed with air depressed,  Nor on the letter yet hath she  The image of her seal impressed.  But gray Phillippevna the door  Opened with care, and entering bore  A cup of tea upon a tray.  \"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!  My beauty, thou art ready too.  My morning birdie, yesternight  I was half silly with affright.  But praised be God! in health art thou!  The pains of night have wholly fled,  Thy cheek is as a poppy red!\"    XXXVI    \"Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!\"  \"Command me, darling, what you choose\"  \"Do not--you might--suspicious be;  But look you--ah! do not refuse.\"  \"I call to witness God on high--\"  \"Then send your grandson quietly  To take this letter to O-- Well!  Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell--  Command him not to say a word--  I mean my name not to repeat.\"  \"To whom is it to go, my sweet?  Of late I have been quite absurd,--  So many neighbours here exist--  Am I to go through the whole list?\"    XXXVII    \"How dull you are this morning, nurse!\"  \"My darling, growing old am I!  In age the memory gets worse,  But I was sharp in times gone by.  In times gone by thy bare command--\"  \"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!  What is thy cleverness to me?  The letter is the thing, you see,--  Oneguine's letter!\"--\"Ah! the thing!  Now don't be cross with me, my soul,  You know that I am now a fool--  But why are your cheeks whitening?\"  \"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,  But send your grandson before long.\"    XXXVIII    No answer all that day was borne.  Another passed; 'twas just the same.  Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn  Tattiana waits. No answer came!  Olga's admirer came that day:  \"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?\"  The hostess doth interrogate:  \"He hath neglected us of late.\"--  Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick--  \"He promised here this day to ride,\"  Lenski unto the dame replied,  \"The post hath kept him, it is like.\"  Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked  As if he cruelly had joked!    XXXIX    'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright  Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,(44)  The china teapot too ye might  In clouds of steam above perceive.  Into the cups already sped  By Olga's hand distributed  The fragrant tea in darkling stream,  And a boy handed round the cream.  Tania doth by the casement linger  And breathes upon the chilly glass,  Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,  And traces with a slender finger  Upon its damp opacity,  The mystic monogram, O. E.    [Note 44: The _samovar_, i.e. \"self-boiler,\" is merely an  urn for hot water having a fire in the center. We may observe  a similar contrivance in our own old-fashioned tea-urns which  are provided with a receptacle for a red-hot iron cylinder in  center. The tea-pot is usually placed on the top of the  _samovar_.]    XL    In the meantime her spirit sinks,  Her weary eyes are filled with tears--  A horse's hoofs she hears--She shrinks!  Nearer they come--Eugene appears!  Ah! than a spectre from the dead  More swift the room Tattiana fled,  From hall to yard and garden flies,  Not daring to cast back her eyes.  She fears and like an arrow rushes  Through park and meadow, wood and brake,  The bridge and alley to the lake,  Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,  The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,  Till out of breath upon a seat    XLI    She sank.--     \"He's here! Eugene is here!  Merciful God, what will he deem?\"  Yet still her heart, which torments tear,  Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.  She waits, on fire her trembling frame--  Will he pursue?--But no one came.  She heard of servant-maids the note,  Who in the orchards gathered fruit,  Singing in chorus all the while.  (This by command; for it was found,  However cherries might abound,  They disappeared by stealth and guile,  So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit--  Device of rural minds acute!)      The Maidens' Song    Young maidens, fair maidens,  Friends and companions,  Disport yourselves, maidens,  Arouse yourselves, fair ones.  Come sing we in chorus  The secrets of maidens.  Allure the young gallant  With dance and with song.  As we lure the young gallant,  Espy him approaching,  Disperse yourselves, darlings,  And pelt him with cherries,  With cherries, red currants,  With raspberries, cherries.  Approach not to hearken  To secrets of virgins,  Approach not to gaze at  The frolics of maidens.    XLII    They sang, whilst negligently seated,  Attentive to the echoing sound,  Tattiana with impatience waited  Until her heart less high should bound--  Till the fire in her cheek decreased;  But tremor still her frame possessed,  Nor did her blushes fade away,  More crimson every moment they.  Thus shines the wretched butterfly,  With iridescent wing doth flap  When captured in a schoolboy's cap;  Thus shakes the hare when suddenly  She from the winter corn espies  A sportsman who in covert lies.    XLIII    But finally she heaves a sigh,  And rising from her bench proceeds;  But scarce had turned the corner nigh,  Which to the neighbouring alley leads,  When Eugene like a ghost did rise  Before her straight with roguish eyes.  Tattiana faltered, and became  Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.  But this adventure's consequence  To-day, my friends, at any rate,  I am not strong enough to state;  I, after so much eloquence,  Must take a walk and rest a bit--  Some day I'll somehow finish it.      End of Canto the Third      CANTO THE FOURTH    Rural Life    'La Morale est dans la nature des choses.'--Necker      Canto The Fourth    [Mikhailovskoe, 1825]    I    THE less we love a lady fair  The easier 'tis to gain her grace,  And the more surely we ensnare  Her in the pitfalls which we place.  Time was when cold seduction strove  To swagger as the art of love,  Everywhere trumpeting its feats,  Not seeking love but sensual sweets.  But this amusement delicate  Was worthy of that old baboon,  Our fathers used to dote upon;  The Lovelaces are out of date,  Their glory with their heels of red  And long perukes hath vanished.    II    For who imposture can endure,  A constant harping on one tune,  Serious endeavours to assure  What everybody long has known;  Ever to hear the same replies  And overcome antipathies  Which never have existed, e'en  In little maidens of thirteen?  And what like menaces fatigues,  Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,  Epistles of six sheets or near,  Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,  Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,  And husbands' tedious amity?

Having listened to their  words, she took pity upon them and said kindly, \"This hovel is yours, my  masters, remain here as long as you please.\" Then she led them into an  inner room, again welcomed them, lamented the poorness of her abode, and  begged them to lie down and rest themselves.    After some interval of time the old woman came to them once more, and  sitting down began to gossip. The minister's son upon this asked her,  \"How is it with thy family, thy relatives, and connections; and what are  thy means of subsistence?\" She replied, \"My son is a favourite servant  in the household of our great king Dantawat, and your slave is the  wet-nurse of the Princess Padmavati, his eldest child. From the coming  on of old age,\" she added, \"I dwell in this house, but the king provides  for my eating and drinking. I go once a day to see the girl, who is a  miracle of beauty and goodness, wit and accomplishments, and returning  thence, I bear my own griefs at home. [57]\"    In a few days the young Vajramukut had, by his liberality, soft speech,  and good looks, made such progress in nurse Lakshmi's affections that,  by the advice of his companion, he ventured to broach the subject ever  nearest his heart. He begged his hostess, when she went on the morrow  to visit the charming Padmavati, that she would be kind enough to slip a  bit of paper into the princess's hand.    \"Son,\" she replied, delighted with the proposal--and what old woman  would not be?--\"there is no need for putting off so urgent an affair  till the morrow. Get your paper ready, and I will immediately give it.\"    Trembling with pleasure, the prince ran to find his friend, who was  seated in the garden reading, as usual, and told him what the old nurse  had engaged to do. He then began to debate about how he should write  his letter, to cull sentences and to weigh phrases; whether \"light of my  eyes\" was not too trite, and \"blood of my liver\" rather too forcible. At  this the minister's son smiled, and bade the prince not trouble his head  with composition. He then drew his inkstand from his waist shawl, nibbed  a reed pen, and choosing a piece of pink and flowered paper, he wrote  upon it a few lines. He then folded it, gummed it, sketched a lotus  flower upon the outside, and handing it to the young prince, told him to  give it to their hostess, and that all would be well.    The old woman took her staff in her hand and hobbled straight to the  palace. Arrived there, she found the Raja's daughter sitting alone in  her apartment. The maiden, seeing her nurse, immediately arose,  and making a respectful bow, led her to a seat and began the most  affectionate inquiries. After giving her blessing and sitting for  some time and chatting about indifferent matters, the nurse said,  \"O daughter! in infancy I reared and nourished thee, now the Bhagwan  (Deity) has rewarded me by giving thee stature, beauty, health, and  goodness. My heart only longs to see the happiness of thy womanhood,  [58] after which I shall depart in peace. I implore thee read this  paper, given to me by the handsomest and the properest young man that my  eyes have ever seen.\"    The princess, glancing at the lotus on the outside of the note, slowly  unfolded it and perused its contents, which were as follows:                         1.                     She was to me the pearl that clings                        To sands all hid from mortal sight                   Yet fit for diadems of kings,                        The pure and lovely light.                         2.                     She was to me the gleam of sun                        That breaks the gloom of wintry day                   One moment shone my soul upon,                        Then passed--how soon!--away.                         3.                     She was to me the dreams of bliss                        That float the dying eyes before,                   For one short hour shed happiness,                        And fly to bless no more.                         4.                     O light, again upon me shine;                        O pearl, again delight my eyes;                   O dreams of bliss, again be mine!--                        No! earth may not be Paradise.    I must not forget to remark, parenthetically, that the minister's son,  in order to make these lines generally useful, had provided them with a  last stanza in triplicate. \"For lovers,\" he said sagely, \"are either in  the optative mood, the desperative, or the exultative.\" This time he had  used the optative. For the desperative he would substitute:                         4.                     The joys of life lie dead, lie dead,                        The light of day is quenched in gloom                   The spark of hope my heart hath fled                        What now witholds me from the tomb      And this was the termination exultative, as he called it:                         4.                     O joy I the pearl is mine again,                        Once more the day is bright and clear                   And now 'tis real, then 'twas vain,                        My dream of bliss--O heaven is here!      The Princess Padmavati having perused this doggrel with a contemptuous  look, tore off the first word of the last line, and said to the nurse,  angrily, \"Get thee gone, O mother of Yama, [59] O unfortunate creature,  and take back this answer\"--giving her the scrap of paper--\"to the fool  who writes such bad verses. I wonder where he studied the humanities.  Begone, and never do such an action again!\"    The old nurse, distressed at being so treated, rose up and returned  home. Vajramukut was too agitated to await her arrival, so he went to  meet her on the way. Imagine his disappointment when she gave him the  fatal word and repeated to him exactly what happened, not forgetting  to describe a single look! He felt tempted to plunge his sword into his  bosom; but Fortune interfered, and sent him to consult his confidant.    \"Be not so hasty and desperate, my prince,\" said the pradhan's son,  seeing his wild grief; \"you have not understood her meaning. Later in  life you will be aware of the fact that, in nine cases out of ten, a  woman's 'no' is a distinct 'yes.' This morning's work has been good; the  maiden asked where you learnt the humanities, which being interpreted  signifies 'Who are you?\"'    On the next day the prince disclosed his rank to old Lakshmi, who  naturally declared that she had always known it. The trust they reposed  in her made her ready to address Padmavati once more on the forbidden  subject. So she again went to the palace, and having lovingly greeted  her nursling, said to her, \"The Raja's son, whose heart thou didst  fascinate on the brim of the tank, on the fifth day of the moon, in  the light half of the month Yeth, has come to my house, and sends this  message to thee: 'Perform what you promised;' we have now come; and  I also tell thee that this prince is worthy of thee: just as thou art  beautiful, so is he endowed with all good qualities of mind and body.\"    When Padmavati heard this speech she showed great anger, and, rubbing  sandal on her beautiful hands, she slapped the old woman's cheeks, and  cried, \"Wretch, Daina (witch)! get out of my house; did I not forbid  thee to talk such folly in my presence?\"    The lover and the nurse were equally distressed at having taken the  advice of the young minister, till he explained what the crafty damsel  meant. \"When she smeared the sandal on her ten fingers,\" he explained,  \"and struck the old woman on the face, she signified that when the  remaining ten moonlight nights shall have passed away she will meet  you in the dark.\" At the same time he warned his master that to all  appearances the lady Padmavati was far too clever to make a comfortable  wife. The minister's son especially hated talented, intellectual, and  strong-minded women; he had been heard to describe the torments of  Naglok [60] as the compulsory companionship of a polemical divine and a  learned authoress, well stricken in years and of forbidding aspect, as  such persons mostly are. Amongst womankind he admired--theoretically,  as became a philosopher--the small, plump, laughing, chattering,  unintellectual, and material-minded. And therefore--excuse the  digression, Raja Vikram--he married an old maid, tall, thin, yellow,  strictly proper, cold-mannered, a conversationist, and who prided  herself upon spirituality. But more wonderful still, after he did marry  her, he actually loved her--what an incomprehensible being is man in  these matters!    To return, however. The pradhan's son, who detected certain symptoms of  strong-mindedness in the Princess Padmavati, advised his lord to be wise  whilst wisdom availed him. This sage counsel was, as might be guessed,  most ungraciously rejected by him for whose benefit it was intended.  Then the sensible young statesman rated himself soundly for having  broken his father's rule touching advice, and atoned for it by blindly  forwarding the views of his master.    After the ten nights of moonlight had passed, the old nurse was again  sent to the palace with the usual message. This time Padmavati put  saffron on three of her fingers, and again left their marks on the  nurse's cheek. The minister's son explained that this was to crave delay  for three days, and that on the fourth the lover would have access to  her.    When the time had passed the old woman again went and inquired after her  health and well-being. The princess was as usual very wroth, and having  personally taken her nurse to the western gate, she called her \"Mother  of the elephant's trunk, [61]\" and drove her out with threats of  the bastinado if she ever came back. This was reported to the young  statesman, who, after a few minutes' consideration, said, \"The  explanation of"]]]
