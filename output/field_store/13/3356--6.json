In 1630 the Plymouth  Company had granted Connecticut to the Earl of Warwick, who turned it  over to Lord Brooke, Lord Say-and-Seal, and others. Winthrop the  Younger, son of Governor Winthrop, of Massachusetts, commissioned by  these last, built a fort at Saybrook. Till the expiration of his  commission the towns immediately upon the Connecticut were under the  government of Massachusetts. Their population in 1643 was three  thousand. A convention of these towns met at Hartford, January 14, 1639,  and formed a constitution, like that of Massachusetts Bay, thoroughly  republican in nature. Connecticut breathed a freer spirit than either  Massachusetts or New Haven, being in this respect the peer of Plymouth.  At Hartford Roger Williams was always welcome.    Meantime, in 1638, having touched at Boston the year before, Davenport,  Eaton, and others from London began planting at New Haven. The Bible was  adopted as their guide in both civil and religious affairs, and a  government organized in which only church members could vote or be  elected to the General Court. The colony flourished, branching out into  several towns. In 1643 it numbered twenty five hundred inhabitants.    As early as 1622, Mason and Gorges were granted land partly in what is  now Maine, partly in what is now New Hampshire; and in 1623 Dover and  Portsmouth were settled. Wheelwright, a brother-in-law of Mrs.  Hutchinson, with others, purchased of the natives the southeast part of  New Hampshire, between the Merrimac and the Piscataqua, and in 1638  Exeter was founded. In the same year with Wheelwright's purchase, Mason  obtained from the council of the Plymouth Company a patent to this same  section, and the tract was called New Hampshire. These conflicting  claims paved the way for future controversies and lawsuits. The settlers  here were not Puritans, nor were they obliged to be church members in  order to be deputies or freemen.    The settlement of Maine goes back to 1626, when the Plymouth Company  granted lands there both to Alexander and to Gorges. In 1639 Gorges  secured a royal charter to re-enforce his claim. Large freedom, civil  and religious, was allowed. For many years the Maine settlements were  small and scattered, made up mostly of such as came to hunt and fish for  a season only.    [1650]    From 1643 to 1684 Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven  formed a confederation under the style of the United Colonies of New  England. Maine, Providence, and Rhode Island sought membership, but were  refused as being civilly and religiously out of harmony with the  colonies named. Connecticut, offensive to the Dutch, and exposed to  hostilities from them, was the most earnest for the union, while at the  same time the most conservative as to its form. It was a loose league,  leaving each colony independent save as to war and peace, Indian  affairs, alliances and boundaries. Questions pertaining to these were to  be settled by a commission of two delegates from each of the four  colonies, meeting yearly, voting man by man, six out of the eight votes  being necessary to bind.    The confederacy settled a boundary dispute between New Haven and New  Netherland in 1650. It received and disbursed moneys, amounting some  years to 600 pounds, for the propagation of the gospel in New England,  sent over by the society which Parliament incorporated for that purpose  in 1649. It was also of more or less service in securing united action  against the savages in Philip's War. The union was, however, of little  immediate service, useful rather as an example for the far future. Its  failure was due partly to the distance of the colonies apart, and to the  strength of the instinct for local self-government, a distinguishing  political trait of New England till our day. Its main weakness, however,  was the overbearing power and manner of Massachusetts, especially after  her assumption of Maine in 1652. In 1653 the Plymouth, New Haven, and  Connecticut commissioners earnestly wished war with New Netherland, but  Massachusetts proudly forbade--a plain violation of the articles. After  this there was not much heart in the alliance. The last meeting of the  commissioners occurred at Hartford, September 5, 1684.        CHAPTER VI.    BALTIMORE AND HIS MARYLAND    [1630]    [Illustration: Maryland Shilling.]    The very year that witnessed the landing of the Pilgrims records the  beginning of another attempt to colonize the New World. While Secretary  of State, having been appointed in 1619, Sir George Calvert, a member of  the Virginia Company from 1609 until its dissolution in 1624, determined  to plant a colony for himself. In the memorable year 1620 he bought of  Lord Vaughan the patent to the south-eastern peninsula of Newfoundland,  the next he sent colonists thither with a generous supply of money for  their support. In 1623 King James gave him a patent, making him  proprietary of this region. In 1625 Calvert boldly declared himself a  Catholic, and resigned his office of Secretary. Spite of this he was  soon afterwards ennobled, and his new title of Lord Baltimore is the  name by which he is best known. Visiting his little settlement in 1627  he quickly came to the conclusion that the severity of the climate would  make its failure certain. He therefore gave up this enterprise, but  determined to repeat the attempt on the more favorable soil of Virginia.  Confident of the goodwill of Charles I., to whom he had written for a  grant of land there, he did not await a reply, but sailed for Virginia,  where he arrived in 1629. In 1632 the king issued a patent granting to  Baltimore and his heirs a territory north and east of the Potomac,  comprising what we now call Maryland, all Delaware, and a part of  Pennsylvania. The name Maryland was given it by the king in, honor of  his queen, Henrietta Maria. But before this charter had received royal  signature Lord Baltimore had breathed his last,  and his son Cecil  succeeded to his honors and possessions.    [Illustration: Henrietta Maria.]    The Maryland charter made the proprietary the absolute lord of the soil.  He was merely to acknowledge fealty by the delivery of two Indian arrows  yearly to the king at Windsor. He could make laws with the consent of  the citizens, declare war or peace, appoint officers of government; in  fact, in most respects he had regal power. The colonists were, however,  to remain English subjects, with all the privileges of such. If they  were not represented in Parliament, neither were they taxed by the  Crown. If the proprietary made laws for them, these must not be contrary  to the laws of England. And they were to enjoy freedom of trade, not  only with England but with foreign countries.    [1634-1635]    This charter, as will be readily seen, could not please the Virginians,  since the entire territory conveyed by it was part of the grant of 1609  to the London Company for Virginia. But as this and subsequent charters  had been annulled in 1624, the new colony was held by the Privy Council  to have the law on its side, and Lord Baltimore was left to make his  preparations undisturbed. He fitted out two vessels, the Ark and the  Dove, and sent them on their voyage of colonization. They went by the  way of the West Indies, arriving off Point Comfort in 1634. Sailing up  the Potomac, they landed on the island of St. Clement's, and took formal  possession of their new home. Calvert explored a river, now called the  St. Mary's, a tributary of the Potomac, and being pleased with the spot  began a settlement. He gained the friendship of the natives by  purchasing the land and by treating them justly and humanely.    [Illustration: Supposed Portrait of William Clayborne.]    [Illustration: Clayborne's Trading Post on Kent Island.]    The proprietary was a Catholic, yet, whether or not by an agreement  between him and the king, as Gardiner supposes, did not use either his  influence or his authority to distress adherents of the Church of  England. The two creeds stood practically upon an equality. But if  religious troubles were avoided, difficulties of another sort were not  slow in arising. About the year 1631, Clayborne, who had been secretary  of the Virginia colony, had chosen Kent Island in Chesapeake Bay as a  station for trading with the Indians. This post was in the very midst of  Maryland, and Calvert notified Clayborne that he should consider it a  part of that province. Clayborne at once showed himself a bitter enemy.  The Indians became suspicious and unfriendly, Clayborne, so it was  believed, being the instigator of this temper. An armed vessel was sent  out, with orders from Clayborne to seize ships of the St. Mary's  settlement. A fight took place, Clayborne fleeing to Virginia. Calvert  demanded that he should be given up. This was refused, and in 1637 he  went to England. A committee of the Privy Council decided that Kent  Island belonged to Maryland.    [1638]    In 1635 the first Maryland assembly met, consisting of the freemen of  the colony and the governor, Leonard Calvert, the proprietary's brother,  who was presiding officer. Lord Baltimore repudiated its acts, on the  ground that they were not proposed by him, as the charter directed. The  assembly which gathered in 1638 retaliated, rejecting the laws brought  forward by the proprietary.    [1639]    For a time the colony was without laws except the common law of England.  But Baltimore was too wise and conciliatory to allow such a state of  affairs to continue. He gave authority to the governor to assent to the  acts of the assembly, which he himself might or might not confirm.    [Illustration: Fight between Clayborne and the St. Mary's Ship.]    Accordingly in 1639 the assembly met and passed various acts, mostly  relating to civil affairs. One, however, was specially noteworthy, as  giving to the \"Holy Church\" \"her rights and liberties,\" meaning by this  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20927"],[0,"A Critical Exposition of the Popular 'Jihád' (#11)"],[1,"of Dahis between Bani Abs and Zobian, the branches of  Ghatafan in Central Arabia; lasted forty years, 568 to 609, A.D.

The war of Fasad continued twenty-five  years till they embraced Islam in 632, A.D.      [Sidenote: Spread of Islam in the surrounding tribes at Medina after the  Hegira I-VI.]    24. During the six eventful years of Mohammad's sojourn at Medina, from  the Hegira to the truce of Hodeibia, where he was every year attacked or  threatened by other hostile Arab tribes, acting always in self-defence,  he had converted several members or almost entire tribes residing round  Medina.    Among them were the following:--         1. The Bani Aslam.[45]       2. Joheina.[46]       3. Mozeina.[47]       4. Ghifar.[48]       5. Saad-bin-Bakr.[49]       6. Bani Ashja.[50]    We never find a single instance even in the _Maghazis_ (accounts of the  campaigns of Mohammad, however untrustworthy they be) of Mohammad's  converting any person, families, or branches of tribes by the scimitar  in one hand and the Koran in the other.    [Footnote 45: The Bani Aslam tribe settled north of Medina in the valley  of Wady-al-Koraa. They were a branch of the Kozaaite tribes descended  from Himyar.]    [Footnote 46: Joheina were a branch of Kozaa, the descendants of Himyar.  This tribe inhabited in the vicinity of Yenbo, north of Medina.]    [Footnote 47: Mozeina were a tribe of the Moaddite stock of Mecca. They  inhabited in Najd, north-east of Medina.]    [Footnote 48: Ghifar were sons of Moleil-bin-Zamra, the descendants of  Kinana, one of the Moaddite tribes.]    [Footnote 49: Saad-bin-Bakr were a branch of Hawazin. Mohammad had been  nursed among them.]    [Footnote 50: The Bani Ashja were a branch of the Ghatafan of the Meccan  stock of the Moaddites. The Bani Ashja appear all to have been hostile  to Mohammad. They fought against the Prophet at the siege of Medina with  four hundred warriors in their contingent. Sir W. Muir says, \"The Bani  Ashja, who had joined in the siege of Medina, gave in their adhesion  shortly after the massacre of the Coreitza; they told Mahomet that they  were so pressed by his warring against them, that they could stand out  no longer.--K. Wackidi, page 60.\" Muir's Life of Mahomet, Vol. IV, 107,  _footnote_. This story is altogether false. We never hear of Mohammad  warring against Bani Ashja; on the contrary, they had themselves invaded  Medina.]      [Sidenote: Mecca a barrier against the conversion of the southern  tribes.]    25. Up to this time, notwithstanding the persecutions, exiles and wars  against Islam, it had spread by the mere force of persuasion among the  Meccans, some of whom had emigrated to Abyssinia and most to Medina, the  whole of the influential tribes of Aws and Khazraj at Medina, as well as  among the Jews there, and among some of the tribes in the north, and  east of Medina and the centre of Arabia. But as Mecca in the south had  declared war against Islam, most of the Arab tribes connected somehow  with the Meccans, and those inhabiting the southern and south-eastern  parts of Arabia, to whom Mecca served geographically as a barrier,  watched the proceedings of the war and the fate of Islam, and had no  opportunity of coming to Medina to embrace Islam, nor of having friendly  intercourse with the Moslems, nor of receiving Mohammadan missionaries  in the face of the wars waged by the Koreish who were looked upon as the  guardians of the Kaaba, the spiritual or religious centre of the  idolatrous Arabs. At the end of the last or the fifth year many Bedouin  tribes, among whom might be counted the Bani Ashja, Murra, Fezara,  Suleim, Sad-bin-Bakr and Bani Asad, had furnished several thousand Arabs  to the Koreish for the siege of Medina. Only when the aggressions of the  Koreish against the Moslems were suspended that the warring tribes and  those of the Central, Southern and Eastern Arabia could think of what  they had heard of the reasonable preaching of Islam against their  idolatry and superstitions.      [Sidenote: Tribal conversions in the sixth year.]    26. Since the truce of Hodeibia at the end of the sixth year after the  Hegira Mecca was opened for intercourse, where there were some more and  fresh conversions. The Bani Khozaa, descendants of Azd, were converted  to Islam at the truce of Hodeibia. At the pilgrimage in the following  year some influential men of Mecca adopted Islam. The movement was not  confined to these leading men, but was wide and general. In the seventh  year the following tribes were converted to Islam and their deputations  joined Mohammad at Khyber:         1. Bani Ashar.[51]       2. Khushain.[52]       3. Dous.[53]    [Sidenote: Conversions among several other tribes of the North and  North-east in A.H., 8.]    During the same year Mohammad converted several other tribes in the  north and north-east of Arabia. Among them were--         1. Bani Abs.       2. Zobian.       3. Murra.       4. Fezara.[54]       5. Suleim.[55]       6. Ozra.       7. Bali.       8. Juzam.[56]       9. Salaba.[57]       10. Abdul Kays.[58]       11. Bani Tamim.[59]       12. Bani Asad.[60]    [Footnote 51: The Bani Ash-ar inhabited Jedda. They were of the  Kahlanite stock, the descendants of Al-Azd.]    [Footnote 52: The Bani Khushain were a clan of Kozaa, of Himiarite  stock.]    [Footnote 53: The Bani Dous belong to the Azdite tribe of the stock of  Kahtan. They lived at some distance south of Mecca. They had joined  Mohammad at Khyber.]    [Footnote 54: These were the sub-tribes of Ghatafan of the Meccan stock.  The chief families of Ghatafan were the Bani Ashja, Zobian, and the Bani  Abs. Murra and Fezara were the branches of Zobian. They all inhabited  Najd. Uyenia, the chief of the Bani Fezara, had committed an inroad upon  Medina in A.H. 6. In the same year the Bani Fezara had waylaid a Medina  caravan and plundered it.]    [Footnote 55: The Bani Suleim, a branch of the Bani Khasafa and a sister  tribe to Hawazin, who lived near Mecca, and in whose charge, Mohammad,  when but an infant, was placed, were also a tribe of the Meccan stock  descended through Khasafa from Mozar and Moadd. Bani Suleim, like Bani  Murra and Fezara, branches of Ghatafan, had long continued to threaten  Mohammad with attacks. The Bani Suleim having joined Aamir bin Tofeil,  chief of Bani Aamir, a branch of the tribe of Hawazin with their clans  Usseya, Ril, and Zakawan, had cut to pieces a party of Moslem  missionaries at Bir Mauna, invited by Abu Bera Amr ibn Malik, a chief of  the Bani Aamir, who had pledged for their security. The Bani Suleim had  joined also the Koreish army at the siege of Medina. In the seventh  year, they had slain another body of Moslem missionaries sent to them.]    [Footnote 56: The Bani Ozra were a tribe of Kozaa, like Joheina. They,  together with the Bani Bali and Juzam, inhabited the north of Arabia in  the part of the territory belonging to Ghassan. The family of Himyar,  descendants from Kahtan in Yemen, had flourished through the line of  Kozaa, the Bani Ozza, Joheina and other important tribes to the north of  the Peninsula on the border of Syria. It has been quoted by Sir W. Muir  from Katib Wakidi that the chief of the Bani Juzam carried back to them  a letter from Mohammad to this tenor: \"Whoever accepteth the call of  Islam, he is among the confederates of the Lord; whoever refuseth the  same, a truce of two months is allowed for him for consideration.\"  (Muir's Life of Mahomet, Vol. IV, p. 107, _foot-note_). The words \"for  consideration\" are not in the original Arabic.--_Vide_ Ibn Hisham, p.  963. It is not clear what was meant by the two months' truce he was  advised to give them, to make terms before he could commence  hostilities, if the tradition for which there is no authority be true.  This has nothing to do with their compulsory conversions.]    [Footnote 57: Salaba was a branch of the Zobian.]    [Footnote 58: The Bani Abd-ul-Kays are a Moaddite tribe, the descendants  of Rabia. They inhabited Bahrein on the Persian Gulf.]    [Footnote 59: The Bani Tamim were branch of Tabikha, a tribe of the  Moaddite stock of Mecca and a sister tribe of Mozeina. They are famous  in the history of Najd, a province north-east of Medina, from the  confines of Syria to Yemen. Some of these branches were with Mohammad at  the expeditions to Mecca and Honain. All the branches of the tribes that  had not yet embraced Islam were now converted.]    [Footnote"]]]
