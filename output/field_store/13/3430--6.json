Of himself he wrote to Theodosia, \"he is a  grave, silent, strange sort of animal, inasmuch that we know not what  to make of him.\" In the political parlance of to-day, his methods  savoured of the \"still hunt,\" and in their exercise he exhibited the  powers of a past-master in stirring up men's prejudices, and creating  divisions among his rivals; but his methods, whether practised in law  or in politics, were neither modern nor moral. He marshalled forces  with equal celerity under either flag.    Shortly after Burr moved into Maiden Lane, Hamilton made his home in  Wall Street. Their first meeting, which occurred on the road from  Harlem bridge to White Plains during the disastrous retreat of  Washington's army from Manhattan in September, 1776, had been  characterised by mutual dislike. Burr, with the rank of major, acted  as aide to General Putnam; Hamilton, as an officer of artillery, was  soon to become an aide to Washington. Both were young then--Hamilton  not yet twenty, Burr scarcely twenty-one; yet their character, then  fully developed, shines out in their estimate of the commander-in-chief.  Burr thought Washington inferior as an officer, and weak, though  honest, as a man; Hamilton thought him a great soldier and a great  statesman, upon whose services the welfare of the country largely  depended. Burr's prejudices settled into positive dislike; Hamilton's  appreciation voiced the sentiment of the people and the judgment of  posterity.    There is a legend that from the first, destiny seemed determined to  oppose the genius and fame of Hamilton with the genius and fame of  Aaron Burr. It is certainly a remarkable coincidence that two men,  born without the State, so nearly of an age, so similar in brilliant  attainments, so notably distinguished in charm of manner and  phenomenal accomplishments, and so strikingly alike in ripeness of  intelligence and bent of ambition, should happen to have lived at the  same time, in the same city, and become members of the same  profession; yet it is not surprising that these men should prove  formidable rivals and deadly foes, since difference in character was  far more real than resemblance of mental attainments. Both were  fearless and brave, but the one was candid, frank and resolute; the  other subtle, crafty and adventurous. Perhaps their only common  characteristic was an ungoverned admiration for the charms of women,  though, unlike Burr, Hamilton neither bragged of his amours, nor  boasted that success attended his pursuit of pleasure.    It can hardly be supposed that in appointing Burr attorney-general,  Clinton did not have in mind the necessity of securing to the ranks of  the anti-Federalists all talented and spirited young men; but it is  none the less evident that Clinton was thinking more of himself than  of his party. Burr figured as an ugly opponent in the recent campaign.  Besides, he possessed the happy faculty of surrounding himself with  young men who recognised in him a superlative combination of bravery,  chivalry, and ability. Hamilton called them \"Burr's myrmidons,\" but  Theodosia, with a daughter's devotion and diplomatic zeal, entitled  them \"the Tenth Legion.\" They had joined Burr when a violent Whig in  1784, sending him to the Assembly for two terms; they had rallied  under his call to the Sons of Liberty, attracting the fierce fire of  Hamilton; and they had broken party bonds to support Robert Yates  because of their chief's personal friendship.    Such a man would attract the attention of any political manager, and  although Clinton up to this time had had no particular relations with  Burr, the latter's enthusiastic support of Yates accentuated his  political value. In after years Burr declared that Clinton had always  been his rival, and Clinton no less frankly avowed his distrust of  Burr, charging him with always being \"for sale;\" but Burr's rivalry  and Clinton's distrust do not date back to 1790.    If Clinton thought himself fortunate in gaining Burr, he was still  more fortunate in the defection of the influential Livingstons. What  Caesar said of Gaul used to be said of the Empire State, that all New  York was divided into three parts--the Clintons, the Livingstons, and  the Schuylers. Parton said \"the Clintons had power, the Livingstons  had numbers, and the Schuylers had Hamilton.\"[53] In 1788 seven  members of the Livingston family, with the Schuylers, had overthrown  the Clintons, and turned the Confederation into the Union. Robert R.  Livingston, standing at their head, was the exponent of a liberal  policy toward all American citizens, and the champion of a broader  national life. His associates were the leading Federalists; his  principles were the pillars of his party; and his ambitions centred in  the success and strength of his country.    [Footnote 53: James Parton, _Life of Aaron Burr_, Vol. 1, p. 169. \"New  York, much more than New England, was the home of natural leaders and  family alliances. John Jay, the governor; the Schuylers, led by Philip  Schuyler and his son-in-law, Alexander Hamilton; the Livingstons, led  by Robert R. Livingston, with a promising younger brother, Edward,  nearly twenty years his junior, and a brother-in-law, John Armstrong,  besides Samuel Osgood, Morgan Lewis and Smith Thompson, other  connections by marriage with the great Livingston stock; the Clintons,  headed by George, the governor, and supported by the energy of DeWitt,  his nephew,--all these Jays, Schuylers, Livingstons, Clintons, had  they lived in New England, would probably have united in the support  of their class; but being citizens of New York they quarrelled.\"--Henry  Adams, _History of the United States_, Vol. 1, pp. 108-09.]    Prudence, therefore, if no higher motive, required that the  Livingstons be not overlooked in the division of federal patronage.  There was much of it to divide. Besides cabinet positions and judicial  appointments, the foreign service offered rare opportunities to a few  accomplished statesmen and recognised scholars. Robert R. Livingston,  as chancellor of New York, stood in line of promotion for chief  justice of the United States Supreme Court, but John Jay stood nearer  to Hamilton, just as Philip Schuyler did when United States senators  were chosen. Other honourable and most desirable positions, however,  were open. John Quincy Adams thought a mission to England or France  better than the Cabinet, but Gouverneur Morris went to France, Thomas  Pinckney to England, William Short to Spain, and David Humphreys to  Portugal. The Livingstons were left out.    Hamilton's funding system, especially the proposed assumption of state  debts, then dividing the public mind, afforded plausible cause for  opposing federalism; and ostensibly for this reason, the Livingstons  ceased to be Federalists. Some of the less conspicuous members,  residents of Columbia County, continued their adherence, but the  statesmen who give the family its name in history wanted nothing more  of a party whose head was a \"young adventurer,\" a man \"not native to  the soil,\" a \"merchant's clerk from the West Indies.\" The story is  that the Chancellor convened the family and made the separation so  complete that Washington's subsequent offer of the mission to France  failed to secure his return.    The first notice of the Livingston break was in the election of a  United States senator in 1791. Philip Schuyler, Hamilton's  father-in-law, confidently expected a re-election. His selection for  the short term was with this understanding. But several members of the  Assembly, nominally Federalists, were friendly to Clinton, who  preferred Aaron Burr to Schuyler because of Hamilton's influence over  him;[54] and when the Governor promised Morgan Lewis, the Chancellor's  brother-in-law, Burr's place as attorney-general, Livingston's  disposition to injure Hamilton became intensified, and to the  disappointment of Schuyler, the vote of the Legislature disclosed a  small majority for Burr.    [Footnote 54: In a letter to Theodorus Bailey, Chancellor Kent, then a  member of the Assembly, expressed the opinion that \"things look  auspicious for Burr. It will be in some measure a question of northern  and southern interests. The objection of Schuyler's being related to  the Secretary has weight.\"--William Kent, _Memoirs and Letters of  James Kent_, p. 39.]    It is easy to conjecture that the haughty, unpopular, aristocratic old  General[55] would not be as acceptable as a young man of thirty-five,  fascinating in manner, gifted in speech, and not yet openly and  offensively partisan; but it needed something more than this charm of  personality to line up the hard-headed, self-reliant legislator  against Hamilton and Philip Schuyler, and Burr found it in his appeal  to Clinton, and in the clever brother-in-law suggestion to Livingston.    [Footnote 55: \"The defeat of Schuyler was attributed partly to the  unprepossessing austerity of his manner.\"--_Ibid._, p. 38.]    The defeat of Schuyler was a staggering blow to Hamilton. The great  statesman had achieved success as secretary of the treasury, but as a  political manager, his lack of tact, impatience of control, and  infirmity of temper, had crippled the organisation. In less than three  years the party had lost a United States senator, suffered the  separation of a family vastly more important than federal appointees,  and sacrificed the prestige of victory, so necessary to political  success.          CHAPTER VI    GEORGE CLINTON DEFEATS JOHN JAY    1792-1795      Burr's rapid advancement gave full rein to his ambition. Not content  with the exalted office to which he had suddenly fallen heir, he now  began looking for higher honours; and when it came time to select  candidates for governor, he invoked the tactics that won him a place  in the United States Senate. He found a few anti-Federalists willing  to talk of him as a stronger candidate than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22594"],[0,"Colonial Records of Virginia (#11)"],[1,"Negors\" (Smith, p. 126), and nearly five years  after, when this census was taken, there were but twenty-two in the  Colony.

This list being made up at James city this neck might be the one nearest  to that place, and therefore the last one named by Beverly would be the  one referred to; but inasmuch as in this MS. list it follows immediately  after the College land, and in the list of Burgesses for 1629, occupies  the same position, it is not improbable that it refers to the peninsula  opposite Henrico, known on all the maps of the State as Farrar's island,  and which has been made an island in reality by the completion of the  canal begun by the United States army during the late civil war and  afterwards finished by the engineer department of the same, under the  direction of Col.

Hening names Burgesses (1629) from  Shirley Hundred island and Shirley Hundred maine, and among the latter  is the name of John Harris, which appears in the text.--Heming Vol. I.,  p. 138.    The name of Shirley appears on the Fry and Jefferson map only at the  place where the same is now located, opposite Bermuda Hundred, and well  known as the residence of Hill Carter, Esq. A short distance below is an  island not named on that map, but on modern maps as Eppes island, which  we may presume was Shirley island. We do not find the name of West in  the connection except in a paper entitled John Rolfe's relation to the  State of Virginia, written in 1616, in which we learn that West and  Shirley Hundred was about thirty-seven miles above James citie, which  corresponds with the location above named.

We can find no clue to its location, but it is  reasonable to suppose it was near Jordan's Point.      _Att James citie and within the Corporation thereof._[W"]]]
