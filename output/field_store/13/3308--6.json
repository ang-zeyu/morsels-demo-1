Increased tourist arrivals have helped spur growth in the  construction and transport sectors. The dual island nation's  agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market; the  sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor shortages  that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and construction.  Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major  products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components.  Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to  depend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in the  US, which accounts for about half of all tourist arrivals.

It was growing in  population and in wealth and in the institutions of a Christian  commonwealth. The territory was divided into parishes for the work of  church and clergy. The stupid obstinacy of the king, against the  remonstrances of the Company, perpetrated the crime of sending out a  hundred convicts into the young community, extorting from Captain Smith  the protest that this act \"hath laid one of the finest countries of  America under the just scandal of being a mere hell upon earth.\" The  sweepings of the London and Bristol streets were exported for servants.  Of darker portent, though men perceived it not, was the landing of the  first cargo of negro slaves. But so grateful was the Company for the  general prosperity of the colony that it appointed a thanksgiving sermon  to be preached at Bow Church, April 17, 1622, by Mr. Copland, which was  printed under the title, \"Virginia's God Be Thanked.\" In July, 1622, the  Company, proceeding to the execution of a long-cherished plan, chose Mr.  Copland rector of the college to be built at Henrico from the endowments  already provided, when news arrived of the massacre which, in March of  that year, swept away one half of the four thousand colonists. All such  enterprises were at once arrested.    In 1624 the long contest of the king and the court party against the  Virginia Company was ended by a violent exercise of the prerogative  dissolving the Company, but not until it had established free  representative government in the colony. The revocation of the charter  was one of the last acts of James's ignoble reign. In 1625 he died, and  Charles I. became king. In 1628 \"the most hot-headed and hard-hearted of  prelates,\" William Laud, became Bishop of London, and in 1633 Archbishop  of Canterbury. But the Puritan principles of duty and liberty already  planted in Virginia were not destined to be eradicated.    From the year 1619, a settlement at Nansemond, near Norfolk, had  prospered, and had been in relations of trade with New England. In 1642  Philip Bennett, of Nansemond, visiting Boston in his coasting vessel,  bore with him a letter to the Boston church, signed by seventy-four  names, stating the needs of their great county, now without a pastor,  and offering a maintenance to three good ministers if they could be  found. A little later William Durand, of the same county, wrote for  himself and his neighbors to John Davenport, of New Haven, to whom some  of them had listened gladly in London (perhaps it was when he preached  the first annual sermon before the Virginia Company in 1621), speaking  of \"a revival of piety\" among them, and urging the request that had been  sent to the church in Boston. As result of this correspondence, three  eminently learned and faithful ministers of New England came to  Virginia, bringing letters of commendation from Governor Winthrop. But  they found that Virginia, now become a royal colony, had no welcome for  them. The newly arrived royal governor, Sir William Berkeley, a man  after Laud's own heart, forbade their preaching; but the Catholic  governor of Maryland sent them a free invitation, and one of them,  removing to Annapolis with some of the Virginia Puritans, so labored in  the gospel as to draw forth the public thanks of the legislative  assembly.    The sequel of this story is a strange one. There must have been somewhat  in the character and bearing of these silenced and banished ministers  that touched the heart of Thomas Harrison, the governor's chaplain. He  made a confession of his insincere dealings toward them: that while he  had been showing them \"a fair face\" he had privately used his influence  to have them silenced. He himself began to preach in that earnest way of  righteousness, temperance, and judgment, which is fitted to make  governors tremble, until Berkeley cast him out as a Puritan, saying that  he did not wish so grave a chaplain; whereupon Harrison crossed the  river to Nansemond, became pastor of the church, and mightily built up  the cause which he had sought to destroy.    A few months later the Nansemond people had the opportunity of giving  succor and hospitality to a shipwrecked company of nine people, who had  been cast away, with loss of all their goods, in sailing from the  Bermudas to found a new settlement on one of the Bahamas. Among the  party was an aged and venerable man, that same Patrick Copland who  twenty-five years before had interested himself in the passing party of  emigrants. This was indeed entertaining an angel. Mr. Copland had long  been a nonconformist minister at the Bermudas, and he listened to the  complaints that were made to him of the persecution to which the people  were subjected by the malignant Berkeley. A free invitation was given to  the Nansemond church to go with their guests to the new settlement of  Eleuthera, in which freedom of conscience and non-interference of the  magistrate with the church were secured by charter.[50:1] Mr. Harrison  proceeded to Boston to take counsel of the churches over this  proposition. The people were advised by their Boston brethren to remain  in their lot until their case should become intolerable. Mr. Harrison  went on to London, where a number of things had happened since  Berkeley's appointment. The king had ceased to be; but an order from the  Council of State was sent to Berkeley, sharply reprimanding him for his  course, and directing him to restore Mr. Harrison to his parish. But Mr.  Harrison did not return. He fulfilled an honorable career as incumbent  of a London parish, as chaplain to Henry Cromwell, viceroy of Ireland,  and as a hunted and persecuted preacher in the evil days after the  Restoration. But the \"poetic justice\" with which this curious dramatic  episode should conclude is not reached until Berkeley is compelled to  surrender his jurisdiction to the Commonwealth, and Richard Bennett, one  of the banished Puritans of Nansemond, is chosen by the Assembly of  Burgesses to be governor in his stead.[51:1]    Of course this is a brief triumph. With the restoration of the Stuarts,  Berkeley comes back into power as royal governor, and for many years  afflicts the colony with his malignant Toryism. The last state is worse  than the first; for during the days of the Commonwealth old soldiers of  the king's army had come to Virginia in such numbers as to form an  appreciable and not wholly admirable element in the population.  Surrounded by such society, the governor was encouraged to indulge his  natural disposition to bigotry and tyranny. Under such a nursing father  the interests of the kingdom of Christ fared as might have been  expected. Rigorous measures were instituted for the suppression of  nonconformity, Quaker preachers were severely dealt with, and clergymen,  such as they were, were imposed upon the more or less reluctant  parishes. But though the governor held the right of presentation, the  vestry of each parish asserted and maintained the right of induction or  of refusing to induct. Without the consent of these representatives of  the people the candidate could secure for himself no more than the  people should from year to year consent to allow him. It was the only  protection of the people from absolute spiritual despotism. The power  might be used to repel a too faithful pastor, but if there was sometimes  a temptation to this, the occasion was far more frequent for putting the  people's reprobation upon the unfaithful and unfit. The colony, growing  in wealth and population, soon became infested with a rabble of  worthless and scandalous priests. In a report which has been often  quoted, Governor Berkeley, after giving account of the material  prosperity of the colony, sums up, under date of 1671, the results of  his fostering care over its spiritual interests in these words: \"There  are forty-eight parishes, and the ministers well paid. The clergy by my  consent would be better if they would pray oftener and preach less. But  of all other commodities, so of this, the worst are sent us. But I thank  God there are no free schools nor printing, and I hope we shall not  have, these hundred years.\"    The scandal of the Virginia clergy went on from bad to worse. Whatever  could be done by the courage and earnestness of one man was done by Dr.  Blair, who arrived in 1689 with limited powers as commissary of the  Bishop of London, and for more than fifty years struggled against  adverse influences to recover the church from its degradation. He  succeeded in getting a charter for William and Mary College, but the  generous endowments of the institution were wasted, and the college  languished in doing the work of a grammar school. Something was  accomplished in the way of discipline, though the cane of Governor  Nicholson over the back of an insolent priest was doubtless more  effective than the commissary's admonitions. But discipline, while it  may do something toward abating scandals, cannot create life from the  dead; and the church established in Virginia had hardly more than a name  to live. Its best estate is described by Spotswood, the best of the  royal governors, when, looking on the outward appearance, he reported:  \"This government is in perfect peace and tranquillity, under a due  obedience to the royal authority and a gentlemanly conformity to the  Church of England.\" The poor man was soon to find how uncertain is the  peace and tranquillity that is founded on \"a gentlemanly conformity.\"  The most honorable page in his record is the story of his effort for  the education of Indian children. His honest attempt at reformation in  the church brought him into collision not only with the worthless among  the clergy, but also on the one hand with the parish vestries, and on  the other hand with Commissary Blair. But all along the \"gentlemanly  conformity\" was undisturbed. A parish of French Huguenots was early  "]]]
