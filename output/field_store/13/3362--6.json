Such was the result of the first year's experience in this chosen place  of settlement by the first New England colony, as stated by the most  distinguished of its founders. During the winter of this year more than  half the pioneer settlers had died of a prevalent sickness,--not owing  to the climate, but their sea voyage, their want of experience, and to  temporary circumstances, for not a death occurred amongst them during  the three succeeding years. As great as was the mortality amongst the  noble colonists of New England, it was far less, comparatively, than  that which fell upon the first colonists of Virginia, who were, also,  more than once almost annihilated by the murderous incursions of the  Indians, but from whom the Pilgrim Fathers did not suffer the loss of a  life.    In his \"true and brief Relation,\" Mr. Winslow says: \"For the temper of  the air here, it agreeth well with that in England; and if there be any  difference at all, this is somewhat hotter in summer. Some think it  colder in winter, but I cannot out of experience say so. The air is very  clear and foggy, not as hath been reported. I never in my life remember  a more seasonable year than we have here enjoyed.\"    Mr. Winslow's doubt as to whether the cold of his first winter in New  England exceeded that of the ordinary winters which he had passed in  England, refutes the fictitious representations of many writers, who to  magnify the virtues and merits of the Plymouth colonists, describe them  as braving, with a martyr's courage, the appalling cold of an almost  Arctic winter--a winter which enabled the new settlers to commence their  gardens the 16th of March, and they add in their Journal: \"Monday and  Tuesday, March 19th and 20th, proved fair days. We digged our grounds  and _sowed our garden seeds_.\"    Not one of the American United Empire Loyalists--the Pilgrim Fathers of  Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick--could tell of a winter in the  countries of their refuge, so mild, and a spring so early and genial, as  that which favoured the Pilgrim Fathers of New England during their  first year of settlement; nor had any settlement of the Canadian Pilgrim  Fathers been able to command the means of celebrating the _first_  \"Harvest Home\" by a week's festivity and amusements, and entertaining,  in addition, ninety Indians for three days.]          CHAPTER II.    THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PILGRIM[10] FATHERS DURING SEVENTY YEARS, FROM  1620 TO 1692, AS DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE PURITAN FATHERS.      TWO GOVERNMENTS.--_Difference between the Government of the Pilgrims and  that of the Puritans_.--Most historians, both English and American, have  scarcely or not at all noticed the fact that within the present State of  Massachusetts two separate governments of Puritan emigrants were  established and existed for seventy years--two governments as distinct  as those of Upper and Lower Canada from 1791 to 1840--as distinct as  those of any two States of the American Republic. It is quite natural  that American historians should say nothing of the Pilgrim government,  beyond the voyage and landing of its founders, as it was a standing  condemnation of the Puritan government, on which they bestow all their  eulogies. The two governments were separated by the Bay of  Massachusetts, about forty miles distant from each other by water, but  still more widely different from each other in spirit and character. The  government of the Pilgrims was marked from the beginning by a full and  hearty recognition of franchise rights to all settlers of the Christian  faith; the government of the Puritans denied those rights to all but  Congregational Church members for sixty years, and until they were  compelled to do otherwise by Royal Charter in 1692. The government of  the Pilgrims was just and kind to the Indians, and early made a treaty  with the neighbouring tribes, which remained inviolate on both sides  during half a century, from 1621 to 1675; the government of the  Puritans maddened the Indians by the invasion of their rights, and  destroyed them by multitudes, almost to entire extermination. The  government of the Pilgrims respected the principles of religious liberty  (which they had learned and imbibed in Holland), did not persecute those  who differed from it in religious opinions,[11] and gave protection to  many who fled from the persecutions of neighbouring Puritans'  government, which was more intolerant and persecuting to those who  differed from it in religious opinions than that of James, and Charles,  and Laud had ever been to them. The government of the Pilgrims was frank  and loyal to the Sovereign and people of England; the government of the  Puritans was deceptive and disloyal to the Throne and Mother Country  from the first, and sedulously sowed and cultivated the seeds of  disaffection and hostility to the Royal government, until they grew and  ripened into the harvest of the American revolution.    These statements will be confirmed and illustrated by the facts of the  present and following chapters.    The compact into which the Pilgrims entered before landing from the  _Mayflower_, was the substitute for the body politic which would have  been organized by charter had they settled, as first intended, within  the limits of the Northern Virginia Company. The compact specified no  constitution of government beyond that of authority on the one hand, and  submission on the other; but under it the Governors were elected  annually, and the local laws were enacted during eighteen years _by the  general meetings of the settlers_, after which a body of elected  representatives was constituted.    The first _official record_ of the election of any Governor was in 1633,  thirteen years after their settlement at Plymouth; but, according to the  early history of the Pilgrims, the Governors were elected annually from  1620. The Governors of the colony were as follows:--    1. John Carver, in 1620, who died a few months afterwards;    2. William Bradford, 1621 to 1632, 1635, 1637, 1639 to 1643, 1645 to  1656;    3. Edward Winslow, 1633, 1636, 1644;    4. Thomas Prince, 1634, 1638, 1657 to 1672;    5. Josiah Winslow, 1673 to 1680;    6. Thomas Hinckley, 1681 to 1692;[12]    when the colony of Plymouth[13] (which had never increased in population  beyond 13,000) was incorporated with that of Massachusetts Bay, under  the name of the Province of Massachusetts, by Royal Charter under  William and Mary, and by which religious liberty and the elective  franchise were secured to all freeholders of forty shillings per annum,  instead of being confined to members of the Congregational Churches, as  had been the case down to that period under the Puritans of  Massachusetts Bay--so that equal civil and religious liberty among all  classes was established in Massachusetts, not by the Puritans, but by  Royal Charter, against the practice of the Puritans from 1631 to 1692.    The government of the Pilgrims was of the most simple kind. At first the  Governor, with one assistant, was elected annually by general suffrage;  but in 1624, at the request of Governor Bradford, a Council of five  assistants (increased to seven in 1633) was annually elected. In this  Court, or Executive Council, the Governor had a double vote. In the  third year, 1623, trial by jury was established. During eighteen years,  from 1620 to 1638, the legislative body, called the General Court, or  Court of Associates, was composed of the whole body of freemen. It was  not until 1639 that they established a House of Representatives. The  qualifications of a _freeman_ were, that he \"should be twenty-one years  of age, of sober, peaceable conversation, orthodox in religion [which  included belief in God and the Holy Scriptures, but did not include any  form of Church government], and possess rateable estate to the value of  twenty pounds.\"    In 1636--sixteen years after their landing at New Plymouth--the laws  which they had enacted were first collected, prefaced by a declaration  of their right to enact them, in the absence of a Royal Charter. Their  laws were at various times revised and added to, and finally printed in  1671, under the title of \"Their Great Fundamentals.\" They recognized the  general laws of England, and adopted local statutes or regulations  according to what they considered their needs.[14] Of their sense of  duty as British subjects, and of the uniform mutual relations of  friendship existing between them and their Sovereigns, their records and  history furnish abundant proofs. The oath required of their Governors  commenced in the following words: \"You shall swear to be truly loyal to  our Sovereign Lord King Charles, his successors and heirs.\" \"At the  Court held,\" (says the record,) \"at Plymouth, the 11th of June, 1664,  the following was added, and the Governor took the oath thereunto: 'You  shall also attend to what is required by His Majesty's Privy Council of  the Governors of the respective colonies in reference unto an Act of  Parliament for the encouraging and increasing of shipping and  navigation, bearing date from the 1st of December, 1660.'\"    The oath of a freeman commenced with the same words, as did the oath of  the \"Assistants\" or Executive Councillors, the oath of constables and  other officers in the colony. It was likewise ordered, \"That an oath of  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21020"],[0,"The Little Clay Cart (#11)"],[1,"lives. All others merely breathe.  [_He falls at Vasantasena's feet._] Enough, madam, enough. Pray  be seated, madam.    _Vasantasena._ [_Seating herself._] Where is he who is so richly your  creditor, sir?    _Shamp._        The good man's wealth consists in kindly deeds;      All other wealth is vain and quickly flies.      The man who honors not his neighbor's needs,      Does that man know what honor signifies?                     15    _Vasantasena._ But to continue--    _Shampooer._ So I became a servant in his employ. And when his  wealth was reduced to his virtue, I began to live by gambling. But  fate was cruel, and I lost ten gold-pieces.    _Mathura._ I am ruined! I am robbed!    _Shampooer._ There are the gambling-master and the gambler, looking  for me. You have heard my story, madam. The rest is your  affair.    _Vasantasena._ Madanika, the birds fly everywhither when the tree  is shaken in which they have their nests. Go, girl, and give the  gambling-master and the gambler this bracelet. And tell them that  this gentleman sends it. [_She removes a bracelet from her arm, and  gives it to Madanika._]    _Madanika._ [_Receiving the bracelet._] Yes, mistress. [_She goes out._]    P. 71.2]    _Mathura._ I am ruined! I am robbed!    _Madanika._ Inasmuch as these two are looking up to heaven, and  sighing, and chattering, and fastening their eyes on the door, I  conclude that they must be the gambling-master and the gambler.  [_Approaching._] I salute you, sir.    _Mathura._ May happiness be yours.    _Madanika._ Sir, which of you is the gambling-master?    _Math._        O maiden, fair but something less than shy,      With red lip wounded in love's ardent play,      On whom is bent that sweet, coquettish eye?      For whom that lisp that steals the heart away?               16    _I_ haven't got any money. You'll have to look somewhere else.    _Madanika._ You are certainly no gambler, if you talk that way.  Is there any one who _owes_ you money?    _Mathura._ There is. He owes ten gold-pieces. What of him?    _Madanika._ In his behalf my mistress sends you this bracelet. No,  no! He sends it himself.    _Mathura._ [_Seizing it joyfully._] Well, well, you may tell the noble  youth that his account is squared. Let him come and seek delight  again in gambling.                   [_Exeunt Mathura and the gambler._           *       *       *       *       *    _Madanika._ [_Returning to Vasantasena._] Mistress, the gambling-master  and the gambler have gone away well-pleased.    _Vasantasena._ Go, sir, and comfort your kinsfolk.    _Shampooer._ Ah, madam, if it may be, these hands would gladly  practise their art in your service.    _Vasantasena._ But sir, he for whose sake you mastered the art,  who first received your service, he should have your service still.    _Shampooer._ [_Aside._] A very pretty way to decline my services. How  shall I repay her kindness? [_Aloud._] Madam, thus dishonored as a  gambler, I shall become a Buddhist monk. And so, madam, treasure these  words in your memory: \"He was a shampooer, a gambler, a Buddhist monk.\"    [40.1. S.    _Vasantasena._ Sir, you must not act too precipitately.    _Shampooer._ Madam, my mind is made up. [_He walks about._]        I gambled, and in gambling I did fall,        Till every one beheld me with dismay.      Now I shall show my honest face to all,        And walk abroad upon the king's highway.                   17    [_Tumultuous cries behind the scenes._]    _Shampooer._ [_Listening._] What is this? What is this? [_Addressing  some one behind the scenes._] What did you say? \"Post-breaker,  Vasantasena's rogue elephant, is at liberty!\" Hurrah! I must go  and see the lady's best elephant. No, no! What have I to do with  these things? I must hold to my resolution.                 [_Exit._    [_Then enter hastily Karnapuraka, highly delighted, wearing a gorgeous  mantle._]    _Karnapuraka._ Where is she? Where is my mistress?    _Madanika._ Insolent! What can it be that so excites you? You do  not see your mistress before your very eyes.    _Karnapuraka._ [_Perceiving Vasantasena._] Mistress, my service to  you.    _Vasantasena._ Karnapuraka, your face is beaming. What is it?    _Karnapuraka._ [_Proudly._] Oh, mistress! You missed it! You didn't  see Karnapuraka's heroism to-day!    _Vasantasena._ What, Karnapuraka, what?    _Karnapuraka._ Listen. Post-breaker, my mistress' rogue elephant,  broke the stake he was tied to, killed his keeper, and ran into the  street, making a terrible commotion. You should have heard the  people shriek,        Take care of the babies, as quick as you can.        And climb up a roof or a tree!      The elephant rogue wants the blood of a man.        Escape! Run away! Can't you see?                           18    P. 74.14]    And:        How they lose their ankle-rings!      Girdles, set with gems and things,      Break away from fastenings!        As they stumble, trip, and blunder,      See the bracelets snap asunder,      Each a tangled, pearly wonder!                               19    And that rogue of an elephant dives with his trunk and his feet  and his tusks into the city of Ujjayini, as if it were a lotus-pond  in full flower. At last he comes upon a Buddhist monk.[43] And  while the man's staff and his water-jar and his begging-bowl fly  every which way, he drizzles water over him and gets him between  his tusks. The people see him and begin to shriek again,  crying \"Oh, oh, the monk is killed!\"    _Vasantasena._ [_Anxiously._] Oh, what carelessness, what carelessness!    _Karnapuraka._ Don't be frightened. Just listen, mistress. Then,  with a big piece of the broken chain dangling about him, he picked  him up, picked up the monk between his tusks, and just then  Karnapuraka saw him, _I_ saw him, no, no! the slave who grows  fat on my mistress' rice-cakes saw him, stumbled with his left  foot over a gambler's score, grabbed up an iron pole out of a shop,  and challenged the mad elephant--    _Vasantasena._ Go on! Go on!    _Karnap._        I hit him--in a fit of passion, too--        He really looked like some great mountain peak.      And from between those tusks of his I drew        The sacred hermit meek.                                    20    _Vasantasena._ Splendid, splendid! But go on!    _Karnapuraka._ Then, mistress, all Ujjayini tipped over to one side,  like a ship loaded unevenly, and you could hear nothing but \"Hurrah,  hurrah for Karnapuraka!\" Then, mistress, a man touched the  places where he ought to have ornaments, and, finding that he  hadn't any, looked up, heaved a long sigh, and threw this mantle  over me.    [41.19. S.    _Vasantasena._ Find out, Karnapuraka, whether the mantle is perfumed  with jasmine or not.    _Karnapuraka._ Mistress, the elephant perfume is so strong that I  can't tell for sure.    _Vasantasena._ Then look at the name.    _Karnapuraka._ Here is the name. You may read it, mistress. [_He  hands her the mantle._]    _Vasantasena._ [_Reads._] Charudatta. [_She seizes the mantle eagerly  and wraps it about her._]    _Madanika._ The mantle is very becoming to her, Karnapuraka.    _Karnapuraka._ Oh, yes, the mantle is becoming enough.    _Vasantasena._ Here is your reward, Karnapuraka. [_She gives him  a gem._]    _Karnapuraka._ [_Taking it and bowing low._] Now the mantle is  most wonderfully becoming.    _Vasantasena._ Karnapuraka, where is Charudatta now?    _Karnapuraka._ He started to go home along this very street.    _Vasantasena._ Come, girl! Let us go to the upper balcony and see  Charudatta.

Now when a woman talks Sanskrit, she is like  a heifer with a new rope through her nose; all you hear is \"soo,  soo, soo.\" And when a man tries to sing soft and low, he reminds  me of an old priest muttering texts, while the flowers in his chaplet  dry up. No, I don't like it!    _Charudatta._ My friend, Master Rebhila sang most wonderfully  this evening. And still you are not satisfied.
