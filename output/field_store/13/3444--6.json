[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22775"],[0,"Psychotherapy (#11)"],[1,"first psychological laboratory was created in  Leipzig, Germany, in 1878. It became the parent institution for  laboratories in all countries. At present, America alone has more than  fifty psychological laboratories, many of them large institutions  equipped with precious instruments for the study of ideas and emotions,  memories and feelings, sensations and actions. Still more rapid than  this external growth of the laboratory psychology was the inner growth  of the experimental method. It began with simple experiments on  sensations and impulses, and it seemed as if it would remain impossible  to attack with the experimental scheme the higher and more complex  psychical structures. But just as in physics and chemistry the triumphal  march of the experimental method could not be stopped, one part of the  psychological field after another was conquered. Attention and memory,  association and inhibition, emotion and volition, judgment and feeling  all became subjected to the scientific scheme of experiment. And that  was all supplemented by the progress of physiological psychology,  pathological psychology, child psychology, animal psychology. In this  way the last decades created a science which of course was by principle  a continuation of the old psychology, but yet which had good reason to  designate itself as a \"new\" psychology.    But in this whole development, until yesterday, the curious fact  remained that it was going on without any narrow contact with practical  life; it was a science for the scientist and measured by its practical  achievements in daily life, it seemed barren and unproductive.  Psychology was studied as palaeontology and Sanscrit were studied,  without any direct relation to the life which surrounds us. And yet  after all it deals with the mental facts which have to enter into every  one of our practical deeds, if we are to consider mental life from a  psychological point of view. The psychologists were certainly not to be  blamed for sticking to their theoretical interests. More than that,  they were certainly justified in their reluctance, as everything was in  the making, and incomplete theories can easily do more harm than good.  But slowly a certain consolidation has set in; large sets of facts have  been secured, and psychology seems better prepared to become serviceable  to the practical tasks. On the other hand, it has been noticeable for  some time that not a few of the psychological results have gone over  into unprofessional hands and have been thrown on the market places and  have been brought into many a home where no one knew how to deal with  them rightly. Thus the need seems urgent that the psychologists give up  their over-reserved attitude and recognize it as their duty to serve the  needs of the community.    It is not sufficient for that end, simply to take odds and ends of  psychology and to hand them over to anyone who can see some use for  them. We must have a systematic scientific work done for the special  purpose of adjusting psychological knowledge to the definite practical  tasks and of examining the psychological facts with that practical end  in view. A science must be developed which is related to psychology as  engineering is related to physics and chemistry. Just as the  technological laboratories of the engineer bring out many new problems  which the physicist would never have approached, in the same way we may  expect that special institutions for applied psychology will shape the  psychological inquiry in a new way.    Such a new science of applied psychology of course has before it a  field just as large and manifold as the field of technology, where  physical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and  electrical engineering and so on are separated. Such a future  psychological technology would deal, for instance, with  psychopedagogical problems. There belongs everything which refers to the  psychology of memory or attention, of discipline, of fatigue, of habit,  of imitation or effort; in short, all those mental factors which have to  be considered whenever the schoolchild is looked on from a causal point  of view. Further there is the psycholegal field where the memory and the  perceptions, the suggestibility and the emotions of the witness are to  be studied, where the psychological conditions which lead to crime, the  means to tap the hidden thoughts of the criminal, the inhibitions for  the prevention of crime, the mental effects of punishment and similar  causal processes must be determined. There are the psychoscientific  problems referring to psychological influences on the observations and  judgments and discriminations of the scholar who watches the stars or  who translates an inscription. There are the psychoaesthetic problems  where the task is to examine causally the factors which lead to the  agreeable effects of beautiful surroundings, and from the height of the  psychology of aesthetics in painting and sculpture, the inquiry may go to  the psychology of the pleasant effects in dress-making or cooking. There  are the large groups of psychotechnical problems where the effort refers  to the application of psychology in securing the best conditions for  labor and industry and commerce. It leads from the mental effects of  signals or the mental fatigue in mills to the secrets of advertisements  and salesmanship. There are especially important psychodiagnostical  studies where the aim is to determine the individual differences of man  by experimental methods and to make use of them for the selection of the  right man for the right place. There are psychosocial problems where we  examine the psychological factors which have to enter into public  movements, into social reforms, into legislation and into politics. In  this way new and ever new groups may be added; every time the central  thought is: how far can causal psychological knowledge help us to reach  a certain end? Together with these forms of applied psychology, we find  the psychomedical problems; here belongs everything which allows the  application of causal psychology in the interests of health.    It might be answered that this demand for a strictly causal point of  view can hardly be fulfilled, because, if I am acting,--it may be in the  interest of education or law or technique or medicine,--I must always  have an end in view and to select such an end belongs after all to my  system of purposes. If I am a teacher and have to deal with children,  then it may be said that after all, my knowledge of causal psychology  cannot help me if I am uncertain for which ideals I want to educate  these children. Psychology can tell me that I need these means, if I  want to reach certain effects, but I cannot find out by psychology which  effects are desirable. Psychology may tell me how to make a good  business man or a good scholar or a good soldier out of my boy, but  whether I want him to become a soldier or a merchant I must decide for  myself with reference to general aims, and that leads me back to the  purposive view of life. Such argument is entirely correct. Yes, it is  evident that it is in full harmony with our whole understanding of the  purpose of psychology. We saw that psychology with its causal treatment  of man's mind does not express the immediate reality, but is a certain  reconstruction which allows a calculation of certain effects. Thus it is  itself a system existing for a subject who has certain ends in view. The  whole causal view of man is thus a tool in the service of the purposive  man. This is the reason why it is indeed utterly absurd to think that  psychology can ever help us to determine which end we ought to reach.    In education, for instance, very many different ends might be reached;  psychology cannot decide anything. The decision as to the aims of  education must be made by ethics, which indeed takes not a causal but a  purposive attitude. Only after ethics has selected the aim, psychology  can teach us how to reach it. Of course this principle must hold for the  physician too. All his causal dealing with the mind presupposes that he  has selected a certain end in harmony with his purpose. The only  difference is that, in the case of the physician, there can be no  possible doubt as to the desirable end; what he aims at is a matter of  course, namely, the health of the patient. To desire the health of the  sufferer is thus itself a function which belongs entirely to the  purposive view of the world, and only in the interest of this purpose  does the physician apply his knowledge of psychology or of the causal  sciences of physics, physiology, and chemistry. Indeed only with this  limitation have we the right to say that the psychotherapist takes the  causal,--and that means the psychological,--view of his patient. As far  as he decides to take care of the health of his patient, this decision  itself belongs to the purposive world and to his moral system. The  physician is thus ultimately just like the minister and just like anyone  who deals with his neighbor, a purposive worker; but while the minister,  for instance, remains on this purposive track, the physician puts a  causal system into the service of his purpose. He knows the end, and his  whole aim is to apply his causal knowledge of the physical and psychical  world to the one accepted end of restoring the health of the patient. He  has to ask thus in general: what has psychology to-day to offer which  can be applied in the interests of medicine?    It would be an inexcusable narrowness to confine that chapter of applied  psychology which is to deal with the psychomedical problems to the work  of psychotherapy. Medicine involves diagnosis of illness as well as  therapeutics. Between the recognition and the treatment of the illness  lies the observation of its development and all this is preceded by  steps towards the prevention of illness. In every one of these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22776"],[0,"From a Terrace in Prague (#11)"],[1,"matters too far when  she strangled Ludmilla with her own veil one evening in chapel; she made  the mistake of furnishing the other side with a first-class saint and  royal martyr.    Wenceslaus, the pious elder son, was extremely annoyed at this open  demonstration of family discord. Dragomira was sent into exile; her name  was never mentioned again. The treatment meted out to his mother made of  young Boleslav a more determined pagan than he was before; he sat up at  night hatching heathen plots against brother Wenceslaus. Boleslav's  reincarnation is probably to be found among international financiers of  the present day. The result of his machinations must be told in a fresh  chapter.          CHAPTER IV    Begins with the accession of Wenceslaus I, tells you how to pronounce  his name correctly in Czech, and informs you of his piety and general  saintliness. There is also mention of other saints as suitable company  for Wenceslaus, and a short account of how that prince qualified for a  halo himself. We note also the contrition of Brother Boleslav, who made  a martyr of Wenceslaus, how Boleslav did a good deal of fighting, most  successfully, and extended his dominions thereby. Also how Boleslav  learnt to be neighbourly and wise in his choice of a wife for his  neighbour who was promptly converted to Christianity. Of the son of  Boleslav I and Dubravka, wife of Duke Mieceslav I of Poland. How  Boleslav II, called \"the Pious,\" earned that epithet and started Prague  with a bishop all to herself. Of churches and convents, and Milada, the  pious sister of Boleslav II. Of the growing importance of Prague and how  it was recognized and appreciated by Ibrahim Ibn Jacub and many of his  race.      With the accession of Wenceslaus, first P[vr]emysl prince of that name,  Bohemia passes out of legend into ordered history; its rulers are  henceforth properly labelled and dated. This is chiefly due to the  spread of Christianity; priests and monks take up the tale of kindly  Saga, and keep careful record of events. These chroniclers were not as a  rule unbiassed; I cannot see how they could have been otherwise, for not  only did they undertake the task of compiling history, they were  constantly making propaganda for their own ideals against the paganism  which still had a considerable hold on the sons of Czech. I doubt  whether any historian can be absolutely unbiassed; a warm-blooded  man--and you must be that if you would record the doings of your  fellow-men--is bound to feel sympathy with or dislike for one or other  actors in the far-off pageant of history. I frankly admit myself biassed  in favour of Brother Boleslav the hearty heathen, and somewhat bored by  that saintly lady Ludmilla. A night out with Boleslav would have been  more amusing, if less edifying, than a country walk with pious  Wenceslaus, who would be sure to waste a good deal of time at wayside  shrines; a picnic arranged by Dragomira and in that lady's company,  would have been at least a material improvement on any little outing  with Ludmilla, who would surely have discovered some reason for fasting  on that particular day. But then I can afford a bias; am only making  observations from \"a Terrace in Prague.\"    Monkish chroniclers sang the praises of Prince Wenceslaus. My spelling  of this name is incorrect, but it is more familiar to English eyes than  any other, as our Christmas carol \"puts it with a 'we.'\" I do not  suggest that this St. Wenceslaus is identical with the \"Good King  Wenceslaus\" we sing about--in fact, I have discovered another ruler of  that name who fits the part much better; but of this more anon. The  correct version of this saintly prince's name is Vaclav, pronounced  Vatslav. It is as well to get a proper grip of this word, as the show  street in the town is named Vaclavske Nam[ve]sti, which being  interpreted meaneth Wenceslaus Place; the Germans call it Wenzel's  Platz, but this designation is not popular at the moment. It is  advisable to acquire the Czech version of the name, as the Vaclavske  Nam[ve]sti is in the business and amusement quarter of the town. As to  the pronunciation of Vaclavske Nam[ve]sti, it presents no particular  difficulties, despite the profusion of accents (the Czechs are very  liberal in this respect), they seem to make no noticeable difference  with exception of the inverted circumflex, which makes \"ye\" out of plain  \"e.\" This is nothing to what the Czech language can do in the way of  tongue-twisters.    The Vaclavske Nam[ve]sti rises gently towards another hill of Prague,  Vinohrady. At the top of the rise, looking right down the broad avenue  over the old town and beyond it to the Hrad[vs]any, is an equestrian  statue of St. Wenceslaus. There are other likenesses of the Saint; a  number of them adorn his chapel in the Cathedral of St. Vitus, and  another statue stands near the castle entrance on the Hrad[vs]any, in  the latter Wenceslaus is shown looking out over the city, his hand  upraised in blessing, which is right and proper and quite what the city  expects of him. The equestrian statue is the most recent portrait of the  pious prince, and is really quite convincing. We know, or at least I am  about to tell you, that Wenceslaus was a man of peace, he is therefore  represented carrying a lance; the modern sense of propriety requires of  a non-combatant that he should sit for his portrait armed. He need not  introduce a bunch of bombs or a pot of poison gas into the composition,  a sword will do. Wenceslaus brought his lance much as the up-to-date  war-winner girds on a sword when he goes to be photographed. Swords may  also be worn at weddings, at funerals, also at christenings I believe;  anyway, on all filmable occasions.    As far as I can discover, St. Wenceslaus only had one fight in his life,  and then he got killed.    Now that we have arrived at the first of authentically dated rulers over  Bohemia, Wenceslaus I, 928-935, we may as well take a look round the  Europe of that time. We find first of all that the peoples were capable  of getting into just as bad a mess as they are in to-day, and that  without the aid of any new diplomacy, League of Nations and  International Conferences. England was, so to speak, nowhere in those  days; Englishmen did not wander about the Continent making observations  from terraces, did not even launch missions and commissions on harmless  and unsuspecting countries, in order to impress the inhabitants thereof  with our wealth and our good taste in getting rid of it. England was  very busy with the Scots, Welsh and Danes, who were also causing a deal  of trouble to the broken-up remnants of Charlemagne's Empire. The ideal  of the Holy Roman Empire still lived and inspired a host of adventurous  Counts of the Marches and other bearers of German culture to inroads  into territory inhabited by Slavonic races. The idea seemed to be that  as each Slavonic tribe, principality or kingdom adopted Christianity it  should come under German domination and be held in trust for Mother  Church by German princes as long as the Papacy conformed to their  conception of right and wrong. The Papacy itself seems to have had no  definite ideas of right and wrong at the time, or at least did not put  them into practice; had, in fact, become thoroughly corrupt and  ineffective for good. Christendom was in a parlous state, disunited and  assailed by hosts of barbarians, Danes, Saracens, Hungarians. The latter  had become especially dangerous to the Slavonic peoples. Before Arpad  arrived at Pressburg (now called Bratislava, please) in 829, the  territory inhabited by Slavonic tribes, mostly in principalities of  varying size and importance, had extended with fluctuating frontiers,  from Holstein south-eastward through Central Europe to the Adriatic and  the Balkan range. Arpad drove a wedge into this Slavonic mass and broke  it into two parts; Arpad's descendants still separate northern and  southern Slavs. We have seen how the Empire of Moravia went down before  the Magyars, and that the Bohemians, no longer able to count on support  from that side, were forced to turn to Germany. The intrusion of the  Magyars into Central Europe, by dividing the mass of Slavonic races,  also weakened the influence of the Eastern Church among the Bohemians  and forced those that were inclined towards Christianity into closer  communion with Rome via Germanism. German priests were beginning to gain  the ascendancy over those of the Eastern persuasion, they objected to  services in the Vulgate, and as they knew no language but their own and  only sufficient Latin for their clerical duties, their influence began  to threaten the Slavonic genius of the Bohemians with extinction. This  was undoubtedly their purpose, and it accounts for much of Bohemia's  sufferings during the thousand years following the imposition of a  German bishop on this country by the German King Arnulf to whom the  immediate predecessors of St. Wenceslaus, Spytihnev and Vratislav had  appealed for assistance.    Another social institution which was beginning to make its influence  felt at the time under discussion was the feudal system. Hitherto,  civilized Europe had depended for offensive and defensive operations on  large slow-moving armies of foot-folk; these were ineffective against  marauding barbarians, Vikings in their sharp-prowed ships, or the light  cavalry of Hungarian or Saracen. Moreover, the governmental system  organized by Charlemagne had fallen to pieces, and there was no central  power to order the movements of a large army. Luckily for the cause of  Christendom and western civilization such as it was, the subordinates of  Charles's successors hit upon the right tactics to employ against the  invaders. The nominal subordinates, Counts of the Marches, burgraves,  barons, took a very free hand in those days of decentralized authority  and bad lines of communication. Based on impregnable"]]]
