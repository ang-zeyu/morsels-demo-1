As these conditions were practically  impossible, the Jew was nonsuited and fined for seeking the life of a  citizen.--Shakespeare, _Merchant of Venice_ (1598).    The story is in the _Gesta Romanorum_, the tale of the bond being ch.  xlviii., and that of the caskets ch. xcix.; but Shakespeare took his  plot from a Florentine novelette called _Il Pecorone_, written in the  fourteenth century, but not published till the sixteenth.    There is a ballad on the subject, the date of which has not been  determined. The bargain runs thus:        \"No penny for the loan of it,        For one year shall you pay--      You may do me a good turn        Before my dying day;      But we will have a merry jest,        For to be talk[^e]d long;      You shall make me a bond,\" quoth he,        \"That shall be large or strong.\"      =Merchant's Tale= (_The_), in Chaucer, is substantially the same as the  first Latin metrical tale of Adolphus, and is not unlike a Latin prose  tale given in the appendix of T. Wright's edition of AEsop's fables. The  tale is this:         A girl named May married January, an old Lombard baron, 60 years of       age, but entertained the love of Damyan, a young squire. She was       detected in familiar intercourse with Damyan, but persuaded her       husband that his eyes had deceived him, and he believed       her.--Chaucer, _Canterbury Tales_ (1388).      =Mercian Laws.= (See MARTIAN.)      =Mercilla=, a \"maiden queen of great power and majesty, famous through all  the world, and honored far and nigh.\" Her kingdom was disturbed by a  soldan, her powerful neighbor, stirred up by his wife Adic[)i]a. The  \"maiden queen\" is Elizabeth; the \"soldan,\" Philip of Spain, and \"Adicia\"  is injustice, presumption, or the bigotry of popery.--Spenser, _Fa[:e]ry  Queen_, v. (1596).      =Mercu'tio=, kinsman of Prince Escalus, and Romeo's friend. An airy,  sprightly, elegant young nobleman, so full of wit and fancy that Dryden  says Shakespeare was obliged to kill him in the third act, lest the poet  himself should have been killed by Mercutio.--Shakespeare, _Romeo and  Juliet_ (1598).      =Mercutio of Actors= (_The_), William Lewis (1748-1811).      =Mercy=, a young pilgrim, who accompanied Christiana in her walk to Zion.  When Mercy got to the Wicket Gate, she swooned from fear of being  refused admittance. Mr. Brisk proposed to her, but being told that she  was poor, left her, and she was afterwards married to Matthew, the  eldest son of Christian.--Bunyan, _Pilgrim's Progress_, ii. (1684).      =Merdle= (_Mr._), banker, a skit on the directors of the Royal British  bank, and on Mr. Hudson, \"the railway king.\" Mr. Merdle, of Harley  Street, was called the \"Master Mind of the Age.\" He became insolvent,  and committed suicide. Mr. Merdle was a heavily made man, with an obtuse  head, and coarse, mean, common features. His chief butler said of him,  \"Mr. Merdle never was a gentleman, and no ungentlemanly act on Mr.  Merdle's part would surprise me.\" The great banker was \"the greatest  forger and greatest thief that ever cheated the gallows.\"         Lord Decimus [_Barnacle_] began waving Mr. Merdle about ... as       Gigantic Enterprise. The wealth of England, Credit, Capital,       Prosperity, and all manner of blessings.--Bk. ii. 24.    _Mrs. Merdle_, wife of the bank swindler. After the death of her  husband, society decreed that Mrs. Merdle should still be admitted among  the sacred few; so Mrs. Merdle was still received and patted on the back  by the upper ten.--C. Dickens, _Little Dorrit_ (1857).      =Meredith= (_Mr._), one of the conspirators with Redgauntlet.--Sir W.  Scott, _Redgauntlet_ (time, George III.).    _Meredith_ (_Mr. Michael_), \"the man of mirth,\" in the managing  committee of the Spa hotel.--Sir. W. Scott, _St. Ronan's Well_. (time,  George III.).    _Meredith_ (_Sir_), a Welsh knight.--Sir W. Scott, _Castle Dangerous_  (time, Henry I.).    _Meredith_ (_Owen_), pseudonym of the Hon. Edward Robert Bulwer Lytton  (Lord Lytton), author of _The Wanderer_ (1859), etc. This son of Lord  Bulwer Lytton, poet and novelist, succeeded to the peerage in 1873.      =Me'rida= (_Marchioness_), betrothed to Count Valantia.--Mrs. Inchbald,  _Child of Nature_.      =Meridarpax=, the pride of mice.        Now nobly towering o'er the rest, appears      A gallant prince that far transcends his years;      Pride of his sire, and glory of his house,      And more a Mars in combat than a mouse;      His action bold, robust his ample frame,      And Meridarpax his resounding name.        Parnell, _The Battle of the Frogs and Mice_, iii. (about 1712).      =Merid'ies= or \"Noonday Sun,\" one of the four brothers who kept the  passages of Castle Perilous. So Tennyson has named him; but in the  _History of Prince Arthur_, he is called \"Sir Perm[=o]n[^e]s, the Red  Knight.\"--Tennyson, _Idylls_ (\"Gareth and Lynette\"); Sir T. Malory,  _History of Prince Arthur_, i. 129 (1470).      =Merion= (_James_), New York lawyer, who plays the lover to three women,  honestly believing himself enamoured of each.--Ellen Olney Kirke, _A  Daughter of Eve_ (1889).      =Merle= (_Madame_), a plausible woman with an ambition to be thought the  incarnation of propriety, who carries with her the knowledge that she is  the mistress of a man who has a wife, and that Madame Merle's  illegitimate daughter is brought up by the step-mother, who knows  nothing of the shameful story.--Henry James, _The Portrait of a Lady_  (1881).      =Merlin= (_Ambrose_), prince of enchanters. His mother was Matilda, a nun,  who was seduced by a \"guileful sprite,\" or incubus, \"half angel and half  man, dwelling in mid-air betwixt the earth and moon.\" Some say his  mother was the daughter of Pubidius, lord of Math-traval, in Wales; and  others make her a princess, daughter of Demetius, king of Demet'ia.  Blaise baptized the infant, and thus rescued it from the powers of  darkness.    Merlin died spell-bound, but the author and manner of his death are  given differently by different authorities. Thus, in the _History of  Prince Arthur_ (Sir T. Malory, 1470), we are told that the enchantress  Nimue or Ninive inveigled the old man, and \"covered him with a stone  under a rock.\" In the _Morte d'Arthur_ it is said \"he sleeps and sighs  in an old tree, spell-bound by Vivien.\" Tennyson, in his _Idylls_  (\"Vivien\"), says that Vivien induced Merlin to take shelter from a storm  in a hollow oak tree, and left him spell-bound. Others say he was  spell-bound in a hawthorn bush, but this is evidently a blunder. (See  MERLIN THE WILD.)    [Asterism] Merlin made \"the fountain of love,\" mentioned by Bojardo in  _Orlando Innamorato_, l. 3.    Ariosto, in _Orlando Furioso_, says he made \"one of the four fountains\"  (ch. xxvi).    He also made the Round Table at Carduel for 150 knights, which came into  the possession of King Arthur on his marriage with Queen Guinever; and  brought from Ireland the stones of Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain.    Allusion is made to him in the _Fa[:e]ry Queen_; in Ellis's _Specimens of  Early English Metrical Romances_; in Drayton's _Polyolbion_; in  _Kenilworth_, by Sir W. Scott, etc. T. Heywood has attempted to show the  fulfilment of Merlin's prophecies.        Of Merlin and his skill what region doth not hear?...      Who of a British nymph was gotten, whilst she played      With a seducing sprite ...      But all Demetia thro' there was not found her peer.        Drayton, _Polyolbion_, v. (1612).    _Merlin_ (_The English_), W. Lilly, the astrologer, who assumed the _nom  de plume_ of \"Mer'linus Angl[)i]cus\" (1602-1681).      =Merlin the Wild=, a native of Caledonia, who lived in the sixteenth  century, about a century after the great Ambrose Merlin, the sorcerer.  Fordun, in his _Scotichronicon_, gives particulars about him. It was  predicted that he would die by earth, wood, and water, which prediction  was fulfilled thus: A mob of rustics hounded him, and he jumped from a  rock into the Tweed, and was impaled on a stake fixed in the river bed.  His grave is still shown beneath an aged hawthorn bush at Drummelzier, a  village on the Tweed.      =Merlin's Cave=, in Dynevor, near Carmarthen, noted for its ghastly noises  of rattling iron chains, brazen caldrons, groans, strokes of hammers,  and ringing of anvils. The cause is this: Merlin set his spirits to  fabricate a brazen wall to encompass the city of Carmarthen, and as he  had to call on the Lady of the Lake, bade them not to slacken their  labor till he returned; but he never did return, for Vivien by craft got  him under the enchanted stone, and kept him there. Tennyson says he was  spell-bound by Vivien in a hollow oak tree, but the _History of Prince  Arthur_ (Sir T. Malory) gives the other version.--Spenser, _Fa[:e]ry  Queen_, iii. 3 (1590).      =Merop's Son=, a nobody, a _terrae filius_, who thinks himself somebody.  Thus Pha[:e]ton (Merop's son), forgetting that his mother was an earthborn  woman, thought he could drive the horses of the sun, but not being able  to guide them, nearly set the earth on fire. Many presume like him, and  think themselves capable or worthy of great things, forgetting all the  while that they are only \"Merop's son.\"        Why, Pha[:e]ton (for thou art Merop's son),      Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car,      And with thy daring folly burn the world?        Shakespeare, _Two Gentlemen of Verona_, act iii. sc. 1 (1594).      =Merrilees= (_Meg_), a half-crazy woman, part sibyl and part gypsy. She is  the ruler and terror of the gypsy race. Meg Merrilees was the nurse of  Harry Bertram.--Sir W. Scott, _Gay Mannering_ (time, George II.).         In the dramatized version of Scott's novel, Miss Cushman [1845-9]       made \"Meg Merrilees\" her own. She showed therein indisputably the       attributes of genius. Such was her power over the intention and       feeling of the part, that the mere words were quite a secondary "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20877"],[0,"Mother West Wind's Children (#11)"],[1,". Otter, Mr.  Muskrat, Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Woodchuck, Mr. Coon, who you know was first  cousin to old King Bear, Mr. Gray Squirrel, Mr. Fox Squirrel, Mr. Red  Squirrel, all put on brand new suits.  Mr. Skunk changed his black and  white stripes for a suit of all black, very handsome, very handsome  indeed.  Mr. Chipmunk took care to see that his new suit had the most  beautiful stripes to be obtained.    \"Mr. Jay, who was something of a dandy, had a wonderful new coat that  looked for all the world as it if had been cut from the bluest patch of  sky and trimmed with edging taken from the whitest clouds.  Even Mr.  Crow and Mr. Owl took pains to look their very best.    \"But Mr. Toad couldn't see the need of such a fuss.  He thought his  neighbors spent altogether too much time and thought on dress.  To be  sure he was anxious to look his best when old Mother Nature came, so he  got a new suit all ready.  But Mr. Toad couldn't afford to sit around  in idleness admiring his new clothes.  No indeed!  Mr. Toad had too  much to do.  He was altogether too busy.  He had a large garden to take  care of, had Mr. Toad, and work in a garden is very hard on clothes.  So Mr. Toad just wore his old suit over his new one and went on about  his business.    \"By and by the great day came when old Mother Nature arrived to inspect  the kingdom of old King Bear.  All the little meadow people and all the  little forest folk hastened to pay their respects to old Mother Nature  and to strut about in their fine clothes--all but Mr. Toad.  He was so  busy that he didn't even know that old Mother Nature had arrived.    \"Late in the afternoon, Mr. Toad stopped to rest.  He had just cleared  his cabbage patch of the slugs which threatened to eat up his crop and  he was very tired.  Presently he happened to look up the road, and who  should he see but old Mother Nature herself coming to visit his garden  and to find out why Mr. Toad had not been to pay her his respects.    \"Suddenly Mr. Toad remembered that he had on his working clothes, which  were very old, very dirty and very ragged.  For just a minute he didn't  know what to do.  Then he dived under a cabbage leaf and began to pull  off his old suit.  But the old suit stuck!  He was in such a hurry and  so excited that he couldn't find the buttons.  Finally he got his  trousers off.  Then he reached over and got hold of the back of his  coat and tugged and hauled until finally he pulled his old coat off  right over his head just as if it were a shirt.    \"Mr. Toad gave a great sigh of relief as he stepped out in his new  suit, for you remember that he had been wearing that new suit  underneath the old one all the time.    \"Mr. Toad was very well pleased with himself until he thought how  terribly untidy that ragged old suit looked lying on the ground.  What  should he do with it?  He couldn't hide it in the garden, for old  Mother Nature's eyes are so sharp that she would be sure to see it.  What should he do?    \"Then Mr. Toad had a happy thought.  Every one made fun of his big  mouth.  But what was a big mouth for if not to use?  He would swallow  his old suit!  In a flash Mr. Toad dived under the cabbage leaf and  crammed his old suit into his mouth.    \"When old Mother Nature came into the garden, Mr. Toad was waiting in  the path to receive her.  Very fine he looked in his new suit and you  would have thought he had been waiting all day to receive old Mother  Nature, but for one thing--swallow as much and as hard as he would, he  couldn't get down quite all of his old suit, and a leg of his trousers  hung out of a corner of his big mouth.    \"Of course old Mother Nature saw it right away.  And how she did laugh!  And of course Mr. Toad felt very much mortified.  But Mother Nature was  so pleased with Mr. Toad's garden and with Mr. Toad's industry that she  quite overlooked the ragged trousers leg hanging from the corner of Mr.  Toad's mouth.    \"'Fine clothes arc not to be compared with fine work,' said old Mother  Nature.  'I herewith appoint you my chief gardener, Mr. Toad.  And as a  sign that all may know that this is so, hereafter you shall always  swallow your old suit whenever you change your clothes!'    \"And from that day to this the toads have been the very best of  gardeners.  And in memory of their great, great, great-grandfather a  thousand times removed they have always swallowed their old suits.    \"Now you know what my cousin, old Mr. Toad, did with his old suit just  before Peter Rabbit passed his house this morning,\" concluded  Great-Grandfather Frog.    \"Oh,\" cried the Merry Little Breezes, \"thank you, thank you,  Grandfather Frog!\"    Then they raced away across the Green Meadows and up the Crooked Little  Path to see if old Mr. Toad was gardening.  And Peter Rabbit still  wonders what old Mr. Toad did with his old suit.          X    GRANDFATHER FROG GETS EVEN    Old Grandfather Frog sat on his big green lily pad in the Smiling Pool  dreaming of the days when the world was young and the frogs ruled the  world.  His hands were folded across his white and yellow waistcoat.  Round, red, smiling Mr. Sun sent down his warmest rays on the back of  Grandfather Frog's green coat.    Very early that morning Old Mother West Wind, hurrying down from the  Purple Hills on her way to help the white-sailed ships across the great  ocean, had stopped long enough to blow three or four fat, foolish,  green flies over to the big lily pad, and they were now safely inside  the white and yellow waistcoat.  A thousand little tadpoles, the great,  great-grandchildren of Grandfather Frog, were playing in the Smiling  Pool, and every once in a while wriggling up to the big lily pad to  look with awe at Grandfather Frog and wonder if they would ever be as  handsome and big and wise as he.    And still old Grandfather Frog sat dreaming and dreaming of the days  when all the frogs had tails and ruled the world.    Presently Billy Mink came hopping and skipping down the Laughing Brook.  Sometimes he swam a little way and sometimes he ran a little way along  the bank, and sometimes he jumped from stone to stone.  Billy Mink was  feeling very good--very good indeed.  He had caught a fine fat trout  for breakfast.  He had hidden two more away for dinner in a snug little  hole no one knew of but himself.  Now he had nothing to do but get into  mischief.  You can always depend upon Billy Mink to get into mischief.  He just can't help it.    So Billy Mink came hopping and skipping down the Laughing Brook to the  Smiling Pool.  Then he stopped, as still as the rock he was standing  on, and peeped through the bulrushes.  Billy Mink is very cautious,  very cautious indeed.  He always looks well before he shows himself,  that nothing may surprise him.    So Billy Mink looked all over the Smiling Pool and the grassy banks.  He saw the sunbeams dancing on the water.  He saw the tadpoles having  such a good time in the Smiling Pool.  He saw the Merry Little Breezes  kissing the buttercups and daisies on the bank, and he saw old  Grandfather Frog with his hands folded across his white, and yellow  waistcoat sitting on the green lily pad, dreaming of the days when the  world was young.    Then Billy Mink took a long breath, a very long breath, and dived into  the Smiling Pool.  Now, Billy Mink can swim very fast, very fast  indeed.  For a little way he can swim even faster than Mr. Trout.  And  he can stay under water a long time.    Straight across the Smiling Pool, with not even the tip of his nose out  of water, swam Billy Mink.  The thousand little tadpoles saw him coming  and fled in all directions to bury themselves in the mud at the bottom  of the Smiling Pool, for when he thinks no one is looking Billy Mink  sometimes gobbles up a fat tadpole for breakfast.    Straight across the Smiling Pool swam Billy Mink toward the big green  lily pad where Grandfather Frog sat dreaming of the days when the world  was young.  When he was right under the big green lily pad he suddenly  kicked up hard with his hind feet.  Up went the big green lily pad,  and, of course, up went Grandfather Frog--up and over flat on his back,  with a great splash into the Smiling Pool!    Now, Grandfather Frog's mouth is very big.  Indeed, no one else has so  big a mouth, unless it be his cousin, old Mr. Toad.  And when  Grandfather Frog went over flat on his back, splash in the Smiling  Pool, his mouth was wide open.    You see he was so surprised he forgot to close it.  So, of course,  Grandfather Frog swallowed a great deal of water, and he choked and  spluttered and swam around in foolish little circles trying to find  himself.  Finally he climbed out on his big green lily pad.    [Illustration: He was so surprised he forgot to close it.]    \"Chug-a-rum?\"  said  Grandfather Frog, and looked this way and looked  that way.  Then he gave a funny hop and turned about in the opposite  direction and looked this way and looked that way, but all he saw was  the Smiling Pool dimpling and smiling, Mrs. Redwing bringing a fat worm  to her hungry little babies in their snug nest in the bulrushes, and  the Merry Little Breezes hurrying over to see what the trouble might be.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog.  \"It is very strange.  I must have  fallen asleep and had a bad dream.\"    Then he once more settled himself comfortably on the big green lily  pad, folded his hands across his white and yellow waistcoat, and seemed  to be dreaming again, only his big goggly eyes were not dreaming.  No,  indeed!  They were very much awake, and they saw all that was going on  in the Smiling Pool.  Great-Grandfather Frog was just pretending.  You  may fool him once, but Grandfather Frog has lived so long that he has  become very wise, and though Billy Mink is very smart, it takes some  one a great deal smarter than Billy Mink to fool Grandfather Frog twice  in the same way.    Billy Mink, hiding behind the Big Rock, had laughed and laughed till he"]]]
