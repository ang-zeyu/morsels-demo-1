For a fuller discussion of these matters,  see the author's text book on terminology.[14]    [Footnote 14: Gehrkens, _Music Notation and Terminology_. The A.S.  Barnes Co., New York.]    The third means of finding tempo has already been discussed, (see p.  45) and the fifth needs no further explanation; but a word should  perhaps be said to the amateur about the matter of tradition. The  young conductor must not fail to take into consideration the fact that  there has grown up, in connection with many of the classics, a well  defined idea of the tempos most appropriate to their rendition, and  that any pronounced departure from this traditional tempo is apt to  result in unfavorable criticism. Tradition is of course apt to make us  hide-bound in all sorts of ways, and yet in many respects it is a very  good thing, and before our conductor attempts to direct standard works  it will be well for him to hear them rendered by some of the better  organizations, so that he may ascertain what the traditional tempo is.  In this way he may at least avoid the accusation of ignorance which  might otherwise be made. This latter point will remind the reader of  the advice already so frequently given--_viz._, \"study music and  listen to music a long time before you attempt very much conducting.\"    [Sidenote: VARIATION IN TEMPO]    Our treatment of tempo thus far has taken cognizance of only the  generalized tempo of the movement, and we have not discussed at all  the much more difficult matter of _variation_ in tempo. The more  evident changes of this sort are indicated by the composer through  such expressions as _ritardando_, _accelerando_, _et cetera_; and it  may be well to give at this point a list of the commoner of these  terms together with their meanings. Obviously, such indications are of  two general types dealing respectively with increasing and decreasing  speed, and we shall accordingly give the definitions in two classes:         TERMS INDICATING A MORE RAPID TEMPO         1. A gradual acceleration          _accelerando_          _affrettando_          _stringendo_          _poco a poco animato_         2. A definitely faster tempo at once          _piu allegro_          _piu presto_          _piu animato_          _piu mosso_          _piu tosto_          _piu stretto_          _un poco animato_         TERMS INDICATING A SLOWER TEMPO         1. A gradual retard          _ritardando_          _rallentando_          _slentando_         2. A definitely slower tempo at once          _piu lento_          _meno mosso_          _ritenuto_         3. A slower tempo combined with an increase in power          _largando_   }          _allargando_ } (literally, \"becoming broad\")         4. A slower tempo combined with a decrease in power          _morendo_    }          _perdendo_   }          _perdendosi_ } (Usually translated, \"gradually dying away\")          _calando_    }          _smorzando_  }         (After any of the terms in the above list, a return to the       normal tempo is indicated by such expressions as _a tempo_,       _tempo primo_, _et cetera_.)    [Sidenote: TEMPO _NUANCES_]    But in addition to the variations in tempo more or less definitely  indicated by the composer there are (particularly in modern music)  innumerable tempo fluctuations of a much subtler nature; and since  these are now recognized as a part of really artistic choral and  orchestral interpretation, (as they have long formed an indispensable  element in expressive piano performance) a brief discussion of their  nature will be included before closing this chapter.    In some cases a variable tempo is asked for by the composer by means  of one of the following expressions:         _tempo rubato_ (literally, \"robbed time\")       _ad libitum_ (at pleasure)       _a piacere_ (at pleasure)       _a capriccio_ (at the caprice)       _agitato_ (agitated)         (The term _tempo giusto_--in exact tempo--is the opposite of       the above expressions, and is used to indicate that the       music is to be performed in steady tempo.)    In the majority of cases, however, the composer gives no indication  whatsoever, and the whole responsibility therefore rests upon the  performer or conductor. It is because of this latter fact that the  amateur must study these matters indefatigably. The advent of a more  elastic rhythm and tempo has undoubtedly made all musical performance  infinitely more pleasurable to the listener than it formerly was; but  unfortunately (especially since the advent of Chopin's music) there  has been a great deal of misunderstanding as to the use and meaning  of this valuable new expressional element.    _Tempo rubato_ may be compared to speaking certain words more slowly  or more rapidly in order that the essential meaning of the entire  sentence may be more strongly impressed upon the listener. It must not  however break up the continuity of the tempo; as one writer has said  \"we must bend the tempo, but not break it.\" Another well-known author,  in treating the same point, states that[15]         Freedom in tempo does not mean unsteadiness.... We must have       in music the sense of equilibrium, of stability. A careless,       spasmodic hurrying and retarding leads only to flabbiness       and inconsequence.    [Footnote 15: Dickinson, _The Education of a Music Lover_, p. 21.]    The most common kind of _rubato_ is probably that in which the first  part of the phrase (up to the climax) is accelerated, the climacteric  tone lingered upon slightly, then the remainder of the phrase rendered  _a tempo_ or possibly slightly _ritardando_. But there are many  phrases that demand a totally different sort of treatment; _e.g._, a  _ritardando_ in the first part instead of an _accelerando_. Which is  the appropriate way of delivering any particular phrase must be  determined in every case by musical feeling.    The thing that the beginner is apt to forget at the period when his  musical feeling though sincere is yet characterized by lack of  refinement, is that these _nuances_ must always be subtle, and that  the listener ought not to have fluctuations in tempo thrust in his  face at every turn. Indeed we may say that he should hardly know that  they are present, unless he is making a definite attempt to analyze  the performance. The familiar story of Chopin's breathing toward a  candle flame and making it flicker slightly, with the remark, \"That is  my rubato,\" then blowing it violently out and saying \"This is yours,\"  is quite to the point in this connection.    It is of course understood that _rubato_ is to be employed almost  exclusively in moderate or slow tempos, having little or no place in  rapid, strongly rhythmic music. It should also be remarked that the  more severe the form of the music,--the more architectonic it is--the  less variation in tempo should there be in its rendition, for in this  type of music the expression is primarily intellectual. Such  instrumental works (of which certain compositions of Bach and Mozart  are typical) must not be played sentimentally, as a modern English  writer has remarked, and yet they must be played with sentiment. The  remarks of this same author may well be quoted in closing this  discussion:[16]         Rubato is necessary in emotional music and is an excellent       means of picturing longing, persuading, dreaming, _et       cetera_. That is why its use is so characteristic in       performing the works of the romantic school and why it must       be used with such caution in the classics. The classic must       be clear as daylight--the structure must be evident even on       the surface; but the romantic composition needs often to be       played in a veiled manner in order to produce atmosphere. In       such a case the rhythm is veiled as it were, draped in       gauze, but the rhythmic design is there under the veil just       the same. To express calmness, decision, _et cetera_, avoid       rubato.    [Footnote 16: Matthay, _Musical Interpretation_, p. 88.]    It must now be evident to the reader that this whole matter of musical  _nuance_ is too subtle to be treated adequately in a book of this  character, and it becomes necessary for us once more to advise the  amateur to study music, both vocal and instrumental, in order that his  latent musical feeling may be developed into a ripe and adequate  musical taste.    [Sidenote: TEMPO RECORDED IN MUSCLES]    In concluding the chapter let us emphasize the fact that the  establishing of a tempo is a matter of muscle even more than of mind,  and that before beginning to beat time the conductor should have the  tempo recorded in his muscular memory. Before rising to conduct a  composition then let him feel its tempo in the muscles of the arm and  hand wielding the baton; for if not thus felt, the work will rarely be  begun with a clearly defined rate of speed. This consideration  receives added weight when it is recalled that if the conductor does  not set the tempo, the chorus accompanist or first violinist will, and  they, not having studied the music from this standpoint, will rarely  succeed in hitting upon the correct rate of movement.          CHAPTER VI    INTERPRETATION IN CONDUCTING    (_Continued_)    DYNAMICS      [Sidenote: IMPORTANCE OF DYNAMICS]    Another important factor in the expressive rendition of music is  _dynamics_, _i.e._, the relative loudness and softness of tone. The  composer is supposed to have a fairly large share in this phase of  expression, and in modern music always indicates in the score at least  the most important dynamic changes that he has in mind. But our  observation of musical performances tends to make us feel that in this  aspect, even more than in tempo changes, it is the conductor or  performer who must bear the greater responsibility, and that the  _amount_ of dynamic contrast to be employed certainly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22396"],[0,"King Arthur's Knights (#11)"],[1,"ng, he rode for two days and met with naught. On the third day  the weather was hot about noon, and Sir Lancelot had great list to  sleep. He espied a great apple-tree full of white blossoms, and a fair  shadow was beneath it, and he alighted and tied his horse unto a thorn,  and laid his helmet under his head and slept.    While he thus lay, there rode by him on white mules four ladies of  great estate, with four knights about them, who bore a canopy of green  silk on four spears, so that the high sun should not touch the faces of  the ladies. Then, as they rode by, they heard a war-horse grimly neigh,  and looking aside, they were aware of Sir Lancelot all armed, and  asleep under the apple-tree.    The ladies came nigh him, and of them there was Queen Morgan le Fay,  who was wife of King Lot, and an evil witch; the Queen of Northgales, a  haughty lady; the Lady of the Out-Isles; and the Lady of the Marshes.  And when the Lady of the Marshes saw the knight she cried:    'Now this is as good hap as ever could be, for this is he that slew my  brother, Sir Caradoc of the Dolorous Tower; and for revenge of that, I  would have this knight taken to my tower and torture him before I slay  him.'    'That is well said,' said Morgan le Fay, 'for he bids fair to be one of  the most strong knights of Arthur, whom I hate. This man, Sir Lancelot  du Lake, is the favourite of all the ladies at that court, who hate me.  So will I lay an enchantment on him, so that he shall sleep.'    Then the evil queen laid her hands over the face of Sir Lancelot, and  said strange words that none could understand, and then he was laid  across the crupper of one of the knights' horses, and he did not wake.    When in the twilight Sir Lancelot awoke, he found himself on a straw  pallet in a strange room, and he leaped up and went to a narrow  arrow-slit in the wall and looked out. Before him for a great distance  was a black watery land, with the sun sinking far away on the very  edge, and the pools of the marsh were as if they were of blood.    Then he beat at the door and called, but none responded, and for wrath  he could have dashed the door down, but it was too stout, and he had no  weapon; for his arms had been taken from him.    When it was dark, suddenly it seemed to Sir Lancelot that the room  smelled foul, as if he had been carried into the midst of the quaking  marsh, and was sunk deep in the slime and weeds of a pool. Then,  through the arrow-slit, he saw many strange lights come, dim and blue  like the wild lights that dance and flit over the lonely marshes by  night; but that which made him marvel was that these lights were two  together, as if they were the eyes of evil things. And they came up to  him with a breath that was cold and dank, and they seemed to peer into  his face, but he could see naught of their bodies. The hair upon his  head rose, and his skin went cold. They pressed all about him, and to  defend himself he struck at the eyes, but his blows beat only the air.  Then suddenly Sir Lancelot felt sharp pains, as if small keen knives  had been thrust into his flesh at many places. The stabs increased in  number and in pain, and Sir Lancelot beat about himself and ran to and  fro in the narrow chamber to escape the evil eyes and the stabs, but it  was in vain, and thus all night in much misery he suffered. When for  sheer weariness he lay down and tried to close his eyes, the evil  things would not let him, but ever they tore at him and stabbed him. He  was in anguish of mind more than he could bear, and for all his thought  he could not think of any way to fight against the evil powers which  followed and tortured him wherever he ran.    But at dawn they fled, and then the door of the room opened, and a  damsel appeared, and in her hands was a manchet of sour bread, and a  beaker of water from the ditch of the moat. The damsel was evilly clad  in rags, and seemed like a scullion-maid.    'These,' she said, 'my mistresses bid me say shall be your food until  you die.'    'Damsel,' said Lancelot, 'tell me who hath brought me here and used me  so evilly.'    'It is Queen Morgan le Fay,' said the damsel, 'and the three witch  queens, the Queen of Northgales, the Queen of the Out-Isles, and the  Lady of the Marshes.'    'I doubt not, then, that they would slay me?' said Lancelot. 'But why  hate they me?'    'It is for this,' went on the damsel, 'that you did slay Sir Caradoc,  the brother of the Lady of the Marshes.'    'Alas, then,' said Sir Lancelot, 'there is no pity for me, and none of  my dear friends shall learn of my shameful death.'    'And so that you should suffer much ere you are slain,' went on the  damsel, 'they sent in the night the Coranians, the marsh fiends, to  torture you. Thus will they do until you die, unless, sir knight, you  are a knight with a stout heart, and a good fighter, and will do me  justice. If you will be ruled by me, and will give me a promise, I will  aid you.'    'Damsel, that will I grant you,' said Lancelot, 'for this would be an  evil death for a knight. And full of terror hath been this night, from  the foul things which have beset me.'    'I may not stay further now,' said the maid, 'lest they think I tarry  over-long. But by evening I will come again.'    The day passed and twilight came, and Sir Lancelot was adread for fear  of the night. But anon the damsel came secretly to him and said:    'Now must you promise me this, that you will release my father, whom  Sir Turquine, Sir Caradoc's brother, hath kept in his foul dungeons  since I was but a little child. And all his lands did Sir Turquine rob  from him, and me he gave as a kitchen slut to Morgan le Fay, and evilly  have I been treated who am a good knight's daughter. Now, will ye  promise to free my father?'    'That will I, my poor damsel,' said Lancelot, 'and I will, God aiding  me, slay this Sir Turquine as I slew Sir Caradoc his brother.'    So at the dead of night the damsel opened his door, and with the keys  that she had stolen, she opened twelve other locks that stood between  them and the postern door. Then she brought him to his armour, which  she had hidden in a bush, and she led forth his horse, and he mounted  with much joy, and took the maid with him, and she showed him the way  to a convent of white nuns, and there they had good cheer.    Then, on the morrow, she led him to a thick forest with many hills  therein, and anon they came to a fair ford, and over the ford there  grew a tree, and on it there hung many good shields, each with the  device of some knight thereon, and Sir Lancelot was astounded to see  the shields of many of King Arthur's knights hung there. And on a bole  of the tree there was a bason of copper.    'Now,' said the damsel, 'I have brought you here where is Sir Turquine,  the mightiest knight that ever was found, as men say, and was never  overmatched by any. And in his dungeons are many poor knights, and my  dear father, Sir Darrel. Now strike the bason with the butt of your  spear.'    Sir Lancelot beat such strokes that the bason burst asunder, and then  he was aware of a great knight riding on a black horse. 'This is he,'  said the damsel, 'and now God aid you!'    'What needst thou, sir knight?' cried the other.    'To try my strength on thee,' cried Lancelot, 'for thou hast done great  despite and shame unto many good knights of the Round Table.'    'Art thou of that caitiff crew of ladies' knights?' sneered Sir  Turquine. 'Then I defy thee.'    'Thou hast said enough,' replied Lancelot.    They put their spears in their rests, and came like the wind against  each other, and either smote other in the middle of their shields, so  that both their horses' girths broke. Then, lightly avoiding their  beasts, they came at each other with great fierceness, and so fared for  two hours, feinting and striking, and so heavy were their blows that  each bled from many wounds as they stood. At last, for sheer  breathlessness, each leaned upon his sword.    'Now, fellow,' said Sir Turquine haughtily, 'answer me these questions  I shall put to thee.'    'Say on,' said Sir Lancelot.    'Thou art,' went on Sir Turquine, 'the biggest man that ever I met  with, and like one knight that I hate above all others, and I would  liefer be thy friend than thy foe. Now, therefore, I will give up to  thee my captive knights if thou wilt tell me thy name, and if thou art  not the knight I hate most.'    'Willingly,' said Sir Lancelot. 'But what knight hatest thou above all  other? And why?'    'It is Sir Lancelot du Lake,' cried the knight, 'for he slew my brother  Sir Caradoc of the Dolorous Tower in the Marsh, who was one of the best  knights living. And ever I have sought this Lancelot, and slain and  maimed many good knights and imprisoned others in the quest. To slay  that fellow I have made a vow, and him I would meet above all others.'    'Ha!' laughed Sir Lancelot, 'and I am the first thou hast met whose  love thou wouldst liefer have than my hatred? Well, I will have thee to  wit that I am he ye seek, Sir Lancelot du Lake, and thy brother was an  evil knight and an oppressor.'    'What sayest thou?' cried Sir Turquine. 'Thou art he I seek? Then,  Lancelot, thou art unto me most welcome as ever was any knight, for we  shall never part till the one of us be dead.'    Then they ran at each other like two wild boars, lashing and dashing  with their swords and shields, so that sometimes in their fury they  slipped together on the grass, which was wetted with blood, and fell  striking at each other. But at last Sir Turquine waxed faint and tried  to avoid Sir Lancelot's blows, and his shield sank low, for his arm was  very weary. Seeing this, Sir Lancelot leaped upon him fiercely, and got  him by the banner of his helmet, and thrust him on his knees, and slew  him at a stroke.    When he had rested a while, he went to the castle of Sir Turquine and  released all his prisoners, and was rejoiced to see"]]]
