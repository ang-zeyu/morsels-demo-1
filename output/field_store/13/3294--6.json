They overtook the Ute near Wípho (about 3 miles north  from Hano), but the Ute had driven the flocks up the steep mesa side,  and when they saw the Tewa coming they killed all the sheep and piled  the carcasses up for a defense, behind which they lay down. They had a  few firearms also, while the Hano had only clubs and bows and arrows;  but after some fighting the Ute were driven out and the Tewa followed  after them. The first Ute was killed a short distance beyond, and a  stone heap still (?) marks the spot. Similar heaps marked the places  where other Ute were killed as they fled before the Hano, but not far  from the San Juan the last one was killed.    Upon the return of the Hano from this successful expedition they were  received gratefully and allowed to come up on the mesa to live--the old  houses built by the Asa, in the present village of Hano, being assigned  to them. The land was then divided, an imaginary line between Hano and  Sichumovi, extending eastward entirely across the valley, marked the  southern boundary, and from this line as far north as the spot where the  last Utah was killed was assigned to the Hano as their possession.      When the Hano first came the Walpi said to them, \"let us spit in    your mouths, and you will learn our tongue,\" and to this the Hano    consented. When the Hano came up and built on the mesa they said to    the Walpi, \"let us spit in your mouths and you will learn our    tongue,\" but the Walpi would not listen to this, saying it would    make them vomit. This is the reason why all the Hano can talk Hopí,    and none of the Hopítuh can talk Hano.      [Illustration: Plate XIII. Payupki, plan.]    The Asa and the Hano were close friends while they dwelt in New Mexico,  and when they came to this region both of them were called Hánomuh by  the other people of Tusayan. This term signifies the mode in which the  women of these people wear their hair, cut off in front on a line with  the mouth and carelessly parted or hanging over the face, the back hair  rolled up in a compact queue at the nape of the neck. This uncomely  fashion prevails with both matron, and maid, while among the other  Tusayan the matron parts her hair evenly down the head and wears it  hanging in a straight queue on either side, the maidens wearing theirs  in a curious discoid arrangement over each temple.    Although the Asa and the Hano women have the same peculiar fashion of  wearing the hair, still there is no affinity of blood claimed between  them. The Asa speak the same language as the other Tusayan, but the Tewa  (Hano) have a quite distinct language which belongs to the Tañoan stock.  They claim that the occupants of the following pueblos, in the same  region of the Rio Grande, are of their people and speak the same tongue.         Kótite   Cochití (?).             Kápung   Santa Clara (?)       Númi     Nambé.                   Pokwádi  Pojoaque.       Ohke     San Juan.                Tetsógi  Tesuque.       Posówe   (Doubtless extinct.)     Also half of Taos.    Pleasant relations existed for some time, but the Walpi again grew  ill-tempered; they encroached upon the Hano planting grounds and stole  their property. These troubles increased, and the Hano moved away from  the mesa; they crossed the west valley and built temporary shelters.  They sent some men to explore the land on the westward to find a  suitable place for a new dwelling. These scouts went to the Moen-kopi,  and on returning, the favorable story they told of the land they had  seen determined the Tewa to go there.    Meanwhile some knowledge of these troubles had reached Tceewádigi, and a  party of the Tewa came to Tusayan to take their friends back. This led  the Hopituh to make reparation, which restored the confidence of the  Hano, and they returned to the mesa, and the recently arrived party were  also induced to remain. Yet even now, when the Hano (Tewa) go to visit  their people on the river, the latter beseech them to come back, but the  old Tewa say, \"we shall stay here till our breath leaves us, then surely  we shall go back to our first home to live forever.\"    The Walpi for a long time frowned down all attempts on the part of the  Hano to fraternize; they prohibited intermarriages, and in general  tabued the Hano. Something of this spirit was maintained until quite  recent years, and for this reason the Hano still speak their own  language, and have preserved several distinctive customs, although now  the most friendly relations exist among all the villages. After the Hano  were quietly established in their present position the Asa returned, and  the Walpi allotted them a place to build in their own village. As before  mentioned, the house mass on the southeast side of Walpi, at the head of  the trail leading up to the village at that point, is still occupied by  Asa families, and their tenure of possession was on the condition that  they should always defend that point of access and guard the south end  of the village. Their kiva is named after this circumstance as that of  \"the Watchers of the High Place.\"    Some of the Bear and Lizard families being crowded for building space,  moved from Walpi and built the first houses on the site of the present  village of Sichumovi, which is named from the Sivwapsi, a shrub which  formerly grew there on some mounds (chumo).    This was after the Asa had been in Walpi for some time; probably about  125 years ago. Some of the Asa, and the Badger, the latter descendants  of women saved from the Awatubi catastrophe, also moved to Sichumovi,  but a plague of smallpox caused the village to be abandoned shortly  afterward. This pestilence is said to have greatly reduced the number of  the Tusayan, and after it disappeared there were many vacant houses in  every village. Sichumovi was again occupied by a few Asa families, but  the first houses were torn down and new ones constructed from them.      LIST OF TRADITIONARY GENTES.    In the following table the early phratries (nyu-mu) are arranged in the  order of their arrival, and the direction from which each came is given,  except in the case of the Bear people. There are very few  representatives of this phratry existing now, and very little tradition  extant concerning its early history. The table does not show the  condition of these, organizations in the present community but as they  appear in the traditional accounts of their coming to Tusayan, although  representatives of most of them can still be found in the various  villages. There are, moreover, in addition to these, many other gentes  and sub-gentes of more recent origin. The subdivision, or rather the  multiplication of gentes may be said to be a continuous process; as, for  example, in \"corn\" can be found families claiming to be of the root,  stem, leaf, ear, blossom, etc., all belonging to corn; but there may be  several families of each of these components constituting district  sub-gentes. At present there are really but four phratries recognized  among the Hopituh, the Snake, Horn, Eagle, and Rain, which is  indifferently designated as Water or Corn:    1. Ho´-nan--Bear.

"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19870"],[0,"Illuminated Manuscripts (#11)"],[1,"original MSS. still extant, which, of  course, more vividly speak for themselves, and only require pointing out  to the student.    The clearest method of study being to take things in the order of their  creation, so in order to understand the \"character of savage grandeur  and naïve originality\" which has been attributed to this style, it will  be best to take up these MSS. chronologically. At the same time, if  anyone merely wishes to know what the style is like at its best, Dr.  Rahn must be his guide, as the Golden Psalter which he has selected for  study is as splendid an example as perhaps may be found in the whole  career of the art. We have noticed how the Irish missionary-artists  carried their work to their continental settlements, how they planted  their schools in Burgundy, Switzerland, and Lombardy. Of all their  depositories, however, numerous as they are elsewhere, none is richer in  the relics of their work than the celebrated abbey which takes its name  of St. Gall from that disciple of St. Columbanus, who in 614 founded his  little cell beside the Steinach, about nine miles south of the Lake of  Constance. Under Charles Martel the cell had become a monastery, which  he endowed as a Benedictine abbey. In 830 was founded its magnificent  library of MSS. The library still exists, and at the present moment  gives shelf-room to 1,800 MSS. and more than 41,700 printed books.  Besides this, another, called the Town Library, founded in the sixteenth  century, and containing 500 MSS. and 60,400 printed books, gives this  upland, busy, modern manufacturing Swiss town no mean importance as a  centre of literary culture. Physically it is probably the highest town  in Europe, its street-level being very nearly 2,200 feet above that of  the sea. Its libraries and museums are rich storehouses of mediæval  treasures. The architect raves over its monastic buildings; the scholar  and palæographer gloat over its books and MSS. In the libraries of St.  Gall are some of the masterpieces of Irish Saxon, and Carolingian art,  and its great Benedictine abbey under Grimald from 841, _i.e._ during  the later Carolingian period, possessed one of the most active  _scriptoria_ in Europe. To begin with the beginning, however, we must  leave St. Gall, and, passing by some less important MSS., go back to the  year 781 and the city of Toulouse. In that year, and in the Abbey of St.  Sernin (Saturninus) in that city, was finished a wonderful and truly  splendid manuscript of the Gospels as a present to the Emperor and his  wife Hildegardis. This is our first example. It now is to be seen in the  National Library, Paris (Nouv. acqu. Lat. 1203).    Next comes the Evangeliary of Abbat Angilbert of Centula (now St.  Riquier), near Abbeville, Charlemagne's son-in-law. This MS., executed  about the year 793, is still preserved in the Town Library of Abbeville.  In the same rank, but somewhat finer in execution, comes a third  Evangeliary, that of St. Médard of Soissons, now in the National  Library, Paris (No. 8850, Lat.).    In these three MSS., reproductions from which are to be found in various  modern works on art, the writing and ornamentation are the parts into  which the artist puts his best work, not the figure drawing. Although in  the St. Sernin MS. there is, in the Christ-figure, a distinct attempt at  portraiture quite different from the coils and pen-flourishes which make  up the Gospel-figures in the Irish and Merovingian MSS. Here the  inspiration is clearly Greek, not Irish. The figure is draped in green  and violet--seated on an embroidered cushion before a low castellated  wall. The hair is light, and the chin beardless. The design shows a  decided likeness to the consular ivory diptychs, and the painting  follows the Eastern methods. In the details of ornament only are Irish  features. Thus we trace in this MS. the sources of Carolingian art. The  MS. being dated, is important as affording a means of comparison with  other undated work. It was presented to St. Sernin on the occasion of  the visit of the Emperor and Empress with their son, the amiable Louis  \"le Debonaire,\"[14] just after the latter had been made King of  Aquitaine. Godeschalk, the writer of it, on the last two leaves tells us  that it took him seven years to accomplish. It is written throughout in  gold and silver letters on purple vellum, and is, moreover, ornamented  with borders, pictures, portraits, and panellings. At first it was kept  in a _cumdach_ of silver, set with precious stones, but that has  disappeared.    [14] Mod. Fr. \"Debonnaire.\"    The Golden Gospels of St. Médard, like the Centula MS., are similar, but  betoken an advance in both taste and execution. The figures are still  rude and deformed, but the artist shows a laudable desire, an ambition,  in fact, to imitate the work of better artists than himself.  Nevertheless, the calligraphy and borderwork are the best parts of his  performance. In this MS. the use of silver betrays a tendency to  prodigality. In design, the influence of the artists who built the new  church of San Vitale at Ravenna, a church which became the model for the  Abbey of St. Médard itself, is quite manifest, yet perhaps need not be  traced further than Soissons or Pavia. In certain of the illustrations,  as, for instance, the \"Fountain of Life,\" there is at once a likeness  and a variation as compared with the same symbol in the Evangeliary of  St. Sernin. They are both too intricate to describe, but of both it may  be said that they show an intimate acquaintance with early Christian  symbolism. The ivory carving and architecture of Ravenna have evidently  been known to the director of these frames and backgrounds. In the year  which saw the completion of Godeschalk's Gospels, Alcuin was at Parma,  but when the St. Médard's Gospels were written he was Abbot of St.  Martin's at Tours. It was the presence of Alcuin at the Court of  Charlemagne that accounts for the prevalence of the Saxon character in  the new and beautiful handwriting we now call Carolingian. It was the  presence of Paul Warnefrid that accounts for much of the classic and  most of the Lombardic features, both of the writing and the  illumination. Many other scholars assisted these two in the various  centres in which Alcuin established branches of the palatine schools.  The intercourse with Italy and England was constant, and led to the  frequent interchange of books, and community of methods and models.  Another fine MS. of the same period (c. 780) is the Golden Ada-Codex of  St. Mesmin or Maximin, of Trèves. In 1794 this MS. was taken from Trèves  to Mainz; in 1815 it was transferred to Aix-la-Chapelle, and is now back  again at Trèves. The externals of the Ada-Codex are very costly, its  binding being a late Gothic pendant to the cover of the Echternach  Evangeliary at Gotha. In the centre of the fore-cover there is a  magnificent topaz,[15] with several imperial figures. Inside, the work is  a handsome example of the early Carolingian.[16] It contains the four  Gospels written by order of the \"Mother and Lady Ada,\" sister of Charles  the Great, Abbess of St. Mesmin. Next we have in the British Museum  another grand example of the style as modified by English or Saxon  influence. Also the Zurich Bible, of the same date, executed at  Tours--and the Bamberg Bible, said to be a copy of the Alcuin Bible of  the same school. Then follow the Drogo Sacramentary, presented by the  Emperor to his natural son Drogo, Archbishop of Metz (826-855), perhaps  illuminated at Metz, but of the same school as those above mentioned.    [15] Or sardonyx (Lamprecht says topaz.)    [16] A photograph of the cover is sold by F. Linz of Trèves.    In our own National Library, again, we have the Athelstan Gospels (Harl.  2788), also in all probability executed at Metz. At Paris (Nat. Lib.,  Theol. Lat. 266) is the Evangeliary of Lothaire--a most beautiful  example of gold-writing and ornament. So we might enumerate a score of  splendid MSS., and classify them into their various minor schools. But  such is not our object. All we want here is a general but clear idea of  the style as a whole.    To characterise it broadly by the names of its most important elements  we should call it a Lombard-Saxon style--the interlacing bands and knots  and other minor features and the main character of the writing being of  Saxon origin, the classical foliages and manner of painting the figures  and certain ideas of design Lombardic, strengthened by direct contact  with the sources of the latter style. Whatever variations there may be,  they can generally be accounted for according to locality and centre of  production. We have instanced a few examples of the earlier time as  showing the principal features of the style. Under the Emperor Charles  the Great's grandson, Charles the Bald, Carolingian illumination reached  its highest point of excellence, and the MSS. executed for him or his  contemporaries accordingly give a correct idea of what Carolingian  illuminators considered as good work. The chief centres were still Tours  and Metz--the latter a branch of the former, but gradually developing  distinct features of its own; and among the productions of these schools  there still remain precious--we might say priceless--examples, such as  the Vivien Bible of the Paris Library, so-called because presented by  Count Vivien, Abbat of St. Martin's of Tours, to Charles the Bald in  850.[17] It contains a fine picture of the presentation with _beardless_  figures. It has also a number of exceedingly splendid initials showing  strong Byzantine influence--capitals of columns of classic origin and  traces of Merovingian in letter forms and ornamental details. It is like  the Evangeliary of Lothaire, already mentioned, a most sumptuous example  rich in silver and gold--the latter having a grand portrait of Lothaire  seated on his throne. Both MSS. are in the National Library at"]]]
