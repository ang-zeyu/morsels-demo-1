This  lady came to me on the strength of our former acquaintance; she had so  little sense as not to perceive the immense distance between us which  a few days had caused, and that the opera-dancer kept by the prince de  Soubise could have no relation with the favorite of the king of France.  I endeavored, in vain, to make her perceive it, without mortifying her  too much. She always called me her dear friend, and fairly slaughtered  me with saying that _her_ prince would protect me. It was singular  for her to speak thus to me; to me from whom _her_ prince solicited  protection. She did not confine herself to this, she even insinuated to  me that I should be a gainer in some way. I laughed outright at this,  and said to the _valet de chambre_, who was stationed at the door, \"Call  mademoiselle's servants.\" This annoyed her excessively; all the muscles  of her face were contracted with rage; but she restrained her wrath,  saluted me with an assumed respect, and went away, after having so  worthily acquitted herself of her foolish embassy.    She had quitted me for an hour, when I received a letter from him who  had sent her. The prince de Soubise begged me to grant him an interview,  in which he could enter into an explanation. I replied that I would  receive him, and he came the same day.    \"I am much pained, madame,\" said he, on entering, \"that mademoiselle  Guimard has communicated with so little address what I wished to say to  you.\"    \"Prince, I think you would have done better to have been the bearer of  your own message. You know my station here, and would not have ridiculed  me as she has done.\"    M. de Soubise, much puzzled to know what she had said, asked me the  question.    \"Why,\" I replied, \"she said, that if I would follow your counsels, you  would pay me for my condescension.\"    \"Ah! madame,\" he exclaimed, \"she has completely murdered me. I only  charged her to offer my services to you, and throw myself at your feet,  as I do now.\"    \"Rise, prince, I do not accuse you of such folly, and promise not to  mention it: it is necessary, however, that you should know I have but  one part to play here, that of pleasing the king. Any other character  will not suit me. Honor me with your friendship, and accept mine in  return. I cannot, must not, have any other union with you.\"    Thus terminated this interview; it did not suit me to give the prince  de Soubise any hopes. He and all the Rohans would have lived on it; they  would have turned my confidence to their gain, and as they were for the  most part sharpers, or something akin to it, my name would soon have  been mixed up with some dirty transaction. His family was a hydra of  avarice, and would alone have swallowed up all the wealth of France. If  the king had taken one of the Rohan family for his mistress, I believe  that the finance department would not have sufficed for one year's  expenditure of this prodigal family. I had no objection to the prince de  Soubise coming to supper with me, but I did not feel myself disposed to  give him any control over my mind. I should have been ill-guided by a  man who had no government of himself.    If M, de Soubise did not depart satisfied, madame de Marsan, his  relative, to whom he related the bad success of his attempt, was not  more so. She was a woman to have governed a kingdom, had she been  allowed to do so. There was in her woman's head a capacity superior to  that of all the men of her family. She had a great deal of ambition, and  all her actions were the results of a premeditated plan. She would have  ruled the king, the princes, the princesses, favorites, mistresses, the  court, the city, the parliaments, and the army! Nothing would have been  impossible to her; she was adequate to any thing. Circumstances did not  give her the opportunity of displaying her genius. With great talents  and keen perception, she was reduced to the government of her own family  alone; that was but a trifling matter! In spite of her discontent,  madame de Marsan preserved a sort of neutrality towards me. She allowed  all sorts of ill to be spoken of me without ever repressing a word.  She was then mute and motionless. She saw me torn to pieces without  any emotion. However, when we were together she tried to cajole me in a  thousand ways, all the time detesting me in her heart; and I, who could  scarcely endure the sight of her, paid her a like number of little  attentions. Thus surrounded by hypocrites, I became one myself. We learn  to howl in the society of wolves.

M. the duc de la Vauguyon attempted also to  be the guide of my youth. This nobleman was too much of a Jesuit not to  have a nose of prodigiously fine scent. He perceived that the wind was  in my favor, and approached me in consequence. I have mentioned to  you his first visit, and he made me a second a few days afterwards.  He appeared very affable, very conciliating, and insisted particularly  several times, and that without any apparent motive, that the king,  not being now engaged in the ties of wedlock, he should choose some  agreeable companion, and assuredly could not do better than select  me. The day after this visit, early in the morning, the duke sent me a  splendid bouquet, a homage which he afterwards repeated, and then called  on me a third time.    During this visit after a conversation on the embarrassments of an  introduction at Versailles, he proposed that I should avoid them.    \"You cannot conceal from yourself,\" he said, \"how powerful will be the  cabal against you; and, without including the Choiseuls, you will have  especially to fear the pious party, who will only see in your intimacy  with the king, allow me to say, a crying scandal, and one not profitable  for religion.\"    \"If the pious party unite with those who are not so to destroy me,\" I  rejoined, laughing, \"I shall have all France against me.\"    \"No; but perhaps all the chateau. But there is a way of averting the  storm. Attach yourself to the party of honest men who have been so  greatly calumniated--the Jesuits. Philosophy, supported by the duc de  Choiseul, has repressed them; but the high clergy and the _mesdames  royales_ are attached strongly to them, and you would interest them in  your fortune by favoring these worthy fathers.\"    \"What! monsieur le duc,\" cried I, \"will _messeigneurs_ the clergy of  France, and _mesdames royales_ and their suite be favorable to me, if I  use my influence with the king in espousing the cause of the society of  Jesus?\"    \"Certainly, madame, and I am authorized to promise you. I give you my  word for this. Endeavor to re-establish the order, and there will not be  one of us but will be zealous in supporting you.\"    \"I certainly am desirous of pleasing your friends; but I can see that,  from the first moment of my appearance at court, I shall be at open war  with the Choiseuls and the parliaments.\"    \"What matters it? I confess that the victory will not be easy at first,  but there is no need to exaggerate the difficulties. It is true that the  king has esteem for the duc de Choiseul, but he has much affection for  you, which avails much more.    \"As for the parliaments, he hates them, and for many years has been  desirous of ridding himself of them entirely, and he will effect this by  the help of God and your interference.\"    \"This will be hard work for one so weak as I am.\"    \"Oh, you are sufficiently powerful, I assure you. Only confide in me,  the intermediary between you and my friends, let me guide you, and I  will steer to the right port. What do you think of this, madame?\"    \"Oh! monsieur le duc, it is not at a moment that we can give a positive  reply to such grave matters. I content myself in assuring you, that I  have for you as much confidence as respect, and should be very happy to  obtain your protection.\"    \"My protection! Oh, heaven, madame, you are jesting. It is I who should  be honored by your friendship.\"    \"It is yours; but as yet I am nothing at court, and can do nothing there  until I have been presented. It is for my speedy presentation that my  friends should labor now.\"    \"We will not fail, madame; and if you will allow me to come from time to  time to converse with you, we can take our measures.\"    \"Your visits will always be agreeable.\"    Such was the conversation which I had with the duc de la Vauguyon. I  have given it somewhat at length, because it was the preface to a deep  intrigue which made a vast noise. I think I extricated myself very  well from the net in which the duke sought to catch me. I knew that his  situation at Versailles compelled me to act with caution towards him. He  was in good odor with _mesdames_, had the ear of the young dauphin and  the princes his brothers. He deceived me like a true Jesuit as he was,  in telling me that the _mesdames_ were well disposed towards me; and on  my side I cheated him with a promise of confidence and, friendship which  I never bestowed. Ah! my friend, again and again must I exclaim, what a  villainous place is a court!    Whilst the duc de la Vauguyon was seeking to enlist me under the banners  of heaven or the Jesuits, the marquis of Chauvelin also essayed to make  me his pupil; but as frank as he was amiable, this nobleman did not go  to work in a roundabout manner. He came to me loyally, requesting me to  consider his interests and mine.    \"The king likes me,\" said he, \"and I am attached to him body and soul.  He tenderly loves you, and I should have no difficulty in doing the same "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20839"],[0,"The Mountain Chant, A Navajo Ceremony (#11)"],[1,"the dance of the  great plumed arrow entered, and after them came six more, and performed  this healing dance over Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni as it is performed to this day.  (See paragraph 131.) When this was concluded various groups from among  the strangers entered, one after another, and conducted their different  alÃ¬lis, or shows, which the Navajo then learned and have since practiced  when they sing their songs in the dark circle of branches.    70. When the dance began in the evening there was one of the invited  tribes which, it was noticed, had not arrived. This was the Beqai, or  Jicarilla. The Navajo asked the Ute where the missing ones were, and the  Ute answered that they had passed the Jicarilla on the way; that the  latter were coming, but had stopped to play a game of roulette, or  nÃ¡[n]joj, and were thus delayed. Shortly before dawn the Jicarilla came  and entered the corral to exhibit their alÃ¬li or show. It was a dance of  the nÃ¡[n]joj, for the wands and implements of the dance were the sticks  and wheels used in playing that game.    71. During the night a chief of the Navajo, while walking through the  crowd, observed the grandmother of TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni sitting on the ground. He  approached her and said: \"Your grandson and his friend have done a great  deed for us; they have made a long journey. Many doubted whether they  had really made it until we saw the multitude gathering in our camp from  the north and from the south in obedience to their summons. Now we know  that they have spoken the truth. Tell me, I beg you, how they did this  wonderful thing.\" She answered: \"They are Â¢igini. My grandson for many  years has risen early every morning and run all around TsÃ²tsil (Mount  Taylor, or San Mateo) over and over again before sunrise. This is why  the people have never seen him abroad during the day, but have seen him  asleep in his hogÃ¡n. Around the base of TsÃ²tsil are many tse`nÃ¡`djihi  (heaps of sacrificial stones). These were all made by my grandson; he  drops a stone on one of these piles every time he goes round the  mountain.\"    72. When day began to dawn there were yet several parties who came  prepared to give exhibitions, but had not had a chance; still, at the  approach of day the ceremonies had to cease. At this time, before the  visitors began to leave the corral, the Navajo chief who had spoken with  the grandmother arose and addressed the assembly. He told them all he  knew about the swift couriers and all the grandmother had told him. He  remarked that there were yet many who could not believe that the young  men had made the journey; so, to satisfy all, he proposed that within  twelve days they should have a race between the two fleet akÃ¡ninili  around the base of TsÃ²tsil, if all would agree to reassemble to witness  it, and he begged them to invite their neighbors of the Pueblo and other  tribes to come with them. Then other chiefs arose to speak. In the end  the proposition of the Navajo chief was agreed to. All promised to  return within eleven days and decided that the race should take place on  the morning following. Then they dispersed to their homes.    73. On the afternoon of the eleventh day, when they had reassembled  according to their promises, the Navajo chief arose and addressed them.  He invited the chiefs of the other tribes to come forward and complete  the arrangements for the race. So the headmen all came together at the  place where the Navajo was speaking, and, after some consultation, they  agreed that the race should be around the peak of TsÃ²tsil, but not  around the entire range of mountains. The Navajo separated themselves  into one party and the alien tribes into another, the two parties  standing at a little distance from one another. The aliens were given  the first choice, and they chose IndsiskÃ Ã¯; therefore TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni fell to  the Navajo. Then the betting began. The stakes consisted of strings of  coral, turquoise, and shell beads, of vessels of shells as large as the  earthen basins of the ZuÃ±i, of beautifully tanned buckskins, of dresses  embroidered with colored porcupine quills, and of suits of armor made of  several layers of buckskin. The warriors in those days wore such armor,  but they wear it no longer. The beads and shells were laid in one pile;  the buckskins, the embroidered dresses, and the armor in another; and  the piles were of vast size.    74. The homes of these young men were at KaÃ§-sakÃ Â¢tsÃ©`Ã§qa (Lone Juniper  Standing Between Cliffs), now Cobero CaÃ±on. There is seen to day a rock  shaped like a Navajo hogÃ¡n. It stands near the wagon road and not far  from the town of the Mexicans (Cobero). This rock was once the hut where  TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni dwelt. Not far from it is another rock of similar appearance,  which once was the home of IndsiskÃ Ã¯. For this reason the runners were  started at the Lone Juniper. They ran towards the west and five of the  fleetest runners among the assembled Indians set out at the same time to  see how long they could keep up with them. By the time these five men  had reached the spur of the mountain opposite ÃÃ²saÃ§o (Hot Spring, Ojo de  los Gallinos, San Rafael), the two champions were out of sight. Then the  five turned back; but before they could return to the Lone Juniper the  runners had got in and the race was decided. TlÃ Â¢esÃ§Ã¬ni had won by about  twice the length of his own body, and all the wagered wealth of the  other nations passed into the hands of the Navajo.    75. When all was done the strangers were dissatisfied; they mourned over  their losses and talked about the whole affair among themselves for a  long time. Finally they decided to give the Navajo another challenge if  the latter would agree to a longer racecourse, which should include all  the foothills of the San Mateo range. The Navajo accepted the challenge  and agreed to have the race at the end of another twelve days. Early on  the eleventh day the strangers began to assemble from all quarters; they  continued to arrive all day, and when night fell they were all in. Then  the headmen addressed them, explaining all the conditions of the  challenge and describing carefully the racecourse decided on. The  betting did not run as high this time as before. The Navajo bet only  about one-half of what they won on the former race. Again they started  the two runners, and in such time as you could just mark that the sun  had moved, they were back at the goal; but this time IndsiskÃ Ã¯, the  champion of the alien races, won by about the same distance as he had  lost on the previous occasion.    76. Then the strangers were satisfied and said, \"We will try no more.  Many of our goods are still with the Navajo; but we have done well to  rescue what we have.\" One of the wise men among them said, \"Yes, you  have done well, for had you lost the second race you would have lost  with it the rain and the sunshine and all that makes life glad.\" It is  because the Navajo won so much wealth on this occasion that they have  been richer than the neighboring races ever since.    77. The ceremony cured Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni of all his strange feelings and  notions. The lodge of his people no longer smelled unpleasant to him.  But often he would say, \"I know I cannot be with you always, for the  yays visit me nightly in my sleep. In my dreams I am once more among  them, and they beg me to return to them.\"    78. From LejpÃ¡hiÂ¢o the family moved to DsildjoltcÃ­nÂ¢i (Mountain of  Hatred). Thence they went to TsinbilÃ¡hi (Woods on One Side), and from  there to Tse`yuÃ§Ã¡hia` (Standing Rock Above). In this place they encamped  but one night, and next day they moved to [Â¢]epÃ¨-aÃ§aÂ¢ (Sheep  Promontory), and went on to [Â¢]epÃ¨-Â¢asiÂ¢i (One Sheep Lying Down). Here  again they camped for the night. Next day they traveled by Tse`atcÃ lÃ§ali  (Rock Cracked in Two) to TcoyÃ jnaskÃ­Ã§ (Hill Surrounded With Young Spruce  Trees), to NigÃ qokaÃ¯ (White Ground), and to Tse`yistciÂ¢ (Dipping Rocks,  i.e., dipping strata), where they stopped to rest for the night. On the  following day they journeyed to ÃosakÃ¡zi (Cold Water), in which place  they encamped again.    79. When the morning came, Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni said to his younger brother,  \"Let us go out and try to shoot some deer, so that we may make beÃ§a`  (deer masks), such as we wore in [Â¢]epÃ©ntsa, where we killed so many  deer.\" The brothers departed on the hunt and came to a place called  Dsil-lÃ­jin (Black Mountains), and they sat down on the side of the  mountains looking towards TsÃ²tsil. As they sat there Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni  said, \"Younger brother, behold the Â¢igÃ¬ni!\" (holy ones); but the younger  brother could see no one. Then he spoke again, \"Farewell, younger  brother! From the holy places the gods come for me. You will never see  me again; but when the showers pass and the thunder peals, 'There,' you  will say, 'is the voice of my elder brother,' and when the harvest  comes, of the beautiful birds and grasshoppers you will say 'There is  the ordering of my elder brother.'\"    80. As he said these words he vanished. The younger brother looked all  around, and seeing no one he started for his home. When he returned to  his people he told them of the departure of Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni, and they  mourned as for one dead.          THE CEREMONIES OF DSILYÃDJE QAÃÃL.      81. It has been my lot to see portions of these ceremonies at various  times. The most complete view I had of them was during a visit made to a  place called Niqotlizi (Hard Earth), some twenty miles northwest from  Fort Wingate, New Mexico, and just within the southern boundary of the  Navajo Reservation. This was the only occasion when I obtained full  access to the medicine lodge on the later days of the ceremonies and had  an opportunity of observing the wonderful pictures on sand which are  illustrated in color in the accompanying plates.    82.
