But when the Mohammedan Revival reached the Tartars  early in the nineteenth century, they immediately began labouring with  their christianized brethren, and in a short time most of these reverted  to Islam despite the best efforts of the Orthodox Church and the  punitive measures of the Russian governmental authorities. Tartar  missionaries also began converting the heathen Turko-Finnish tribes to  the northward, in defiance of every hindrance from their Russian  masters.[39]    In China, likewise, the nineteenth century witnessed an extraordinary  development of Moslem energy. Islam had reached China in very early  times, brought in by Arab traders and bands of Arab mercenary soldiers.  Despite centuries of intermarriage with Chinese women, their descendants  still differ perceptibly from the general Chinese population, and  regard themselves as a separate and superior people. The Chinese  Mohammedans are mainly concentrated in the southern province of Yunnan  and the inland provinces beyond. Besides these racially Chinese Moslems,  another centre of Mohammedan population is found in the Chinese  dependency of Eastern or Chinese Turkestan, inhabited by Turkish stocks  and conquered by the Chinese only in the eighteenth century. Until  comparatively recent times the Chinese Moslems were well treated, but  gradually their proud-spirited attitude alarmed the Chinese Government,  which withdrew their privileges and persecuted them. Early in the  nineteenth century the breath of the Mohammedan Revival reached China,  as it did every other part of the Moslem world, and the Chinese  Mohammedans, inflamed by resurgent fanaticism, began a series of revolts  culminating in the great rebellions which took place about the year  1870, both in Yunnan and in Eastern Turkestan. As usual, these  fanaticized Moslems displayed fierce fighting power. The Turkestan  rebels found an able leader, one Yakub Beg, and for some years both  Turkestan and Yunnan were virtually independent. To many European  observers at that time it looked as though the rebels might join hands,  erect a permanent Mohammedan state in western China, and even overrun  the whole empire. The fame of Yakub Beg spread through the Moslem world,  the Sultan of Turkey honouring him with the high title of Commander of  the Faithful. After years of bitter fighting, accompanied by frightful  massacres, the Chinese Government subdued the rebels. The Chinese  Moslems, greatly reduced in numbers, have not yet recovered their former  strength; but their spirit is still unbroken, and to-day they number  fully 10,000,000. Thus, Chinese Islam, despite its setbacks, is a factor  to be reckoned with in the future.[40]    The above instances do not exhaust the list of Islam's activities during  the past century. In India, for example, Islam has continued to gain  ground rapidly, while in the Dutch Indies it is the same story.[41]  European domination actually favours rather than retards the spread of  Islam, for the Moslem finds in Western improvements, like the railroad,  the post-office, and the printing-press, useful adjuncts to Islamic  propaganda.    Let us now consider the second originating centre of modern  Pan-Islamism--the movement especially associated with the personality of  Djemal-ed-Din.    Seyid Djemal-ed-Din el-Afghani was born early in the nineteenth century  at Asadabad, near Hamadan, in Persia, albeit, as his name shows, he was  of Afghan rather than Iranian descent, while his title \"Seyid,\" meaning  descendant of the Prophet, implies a strain of Arab blood. Endowed with  a keen intelligence, great personal magnetism, and abounding vigour,  Djemal-ed-Din had a stormy and chequered career. He was a great  traveller, knowing intimately not only most of the Moslem world but  western Europe as well. From these travels, supplemented by wide  reading, he gained a notable fund of information which he employed  effectively in his manifold activities. A born propagandist,  Djemal-ed-Din attracted wide attention, and wherever he went in Islam  his strong personality started an intellectual ferment. Unlike El  Sennussi, he concerned himself very little with theology, devoting  himself to politics. Djemal-ed-Din was the first Mohammedan who fully  grasped the impending peril of Western domination, and he devoted his  life to warning the Islamic world of the danger and attempting to  elaborate measures of defence. By European colonial authorities he was  soon singled out as a dangerous agitator. The English, in particular,  feared and persecuted him. Imprisoned for a while in India, he went to  Egypt about 1880, and had a hand in the anti-European movement of Arabi  Pasha. When the English occupied Egypt in 1882 they promptly expelled  Djemal, who continued his wanderings, finally reaching Constantinople.  Here he found a generous patron in Abdul-Hamid, then evolving his  Pan-Islamic policy. Naturally, the Sultan was enchanted with Djemal, and  promptly made him the head of his Pan-Islamic propaganda bureau. In  fact, it is probable that the success of the Sultan's Pan-Islamic policy  was largely due to Djemal's ability and zeal. Djemal died in 1896 at an  advanced age, active to the last.    Djemal-ed-Din's teachings may be summarized as follows:    \"The Christian world, despite its internal differences of race and  nationality, is, as against the East and especially as against Islam,  united for the destruction of all Mohammedan states.    \"The Crusades still subsist, as well as the fanatical spirit of Peter  the Hermit. At heart, Christendom still regards Islam with fanatical  hatred and contempt. This is shown in many ways, as in international  law, before which Moslem nations are not treated as the equals of  Christian nations.    \"Christian governments excuse the attacks and humiliations inflicted  upon Moslem states by citing the latter's backward and barbarous  condition; yet these same governments stifle by a thousand means, even  by war, every attempted effort of reform and revival in Moslem lands.    \"Hatred of Islam is common to all Christian peoples, not merely to some  of them, and the result of this spirit is a tacit, persistent effort for  Islam's destruction.    \"Every Moslem feeling and aspiration is caricatured and calumniated by  Christendom. 'The Europeans call in the Orient \"fanaticism\" what at home  they call \"nationalism\" and \"patriotism.\" And what in the West they call  \"self-respect,\" \"pride,\" \"national honour,\" in the East they call  \"chauvinism.\" What in the West they esteem as national sentiment, in the  East they consider xenophobia.'[42]    \"From all this, it is plain that the whole Moslem world must unite in a  great defensive alliance, to preserve itself from destruction; and, to  do this, it must acquire the technique of Western progress and learn the  secrets of European power.\"    Such, in brief, are the teachings of Djemal-ed-Din, propagated with  eloquence and authority for many years. Given the state of mingled fear  and hatred of Western encroachment that was steadily spreading  throughout the Moslem world, it is easy to see how great Djemal's  influence must have been. And of course Djemal was not alone in his  preaching. Other influential Moslems were agitating along much the same  lines as early as the middle of the nineteenth century. One of these  pioneers was the Turkish notable Aali Pasha, who was said to remark:  \"What we want is rather an increase of fanaticism than a diminution of  it.\"[43] Arminius Vambery, the eminent Hungarian Oriental scholar,  states that shortly after the Crimean War he was present at a militant  Pan-Islamic gathering, attended by emissaries from far parts of the  Moslem world, held at Aali Pasha's palace.[44]    Such were the foundations upon which Sultan Abdul Hamid built his  ambitious Pan-Islamic structure. Abdul Hamid is one of the strangest  personalities of modern times. A man of unusual intelligence, his mind  was yet warped by strange twists which went to the verge of insanity.  Nursing ambitious, grandiose projects, he tried to carry them out by  dark and tortuous methods which, though often cleverly Macchiavellian,  were sometimes absurdly puerile. An autocrat by nature, he strove to  keep the smallest decisions dependent on his arbitrary will, albeit he  was frequently guided by clever sycophants who knew how to play upon his  superstitions and his prejudices.    Abdul Hamid ascended the throne in 1876 under very difficult  circumstances. The country was on the verge of a disastrous Russian war,  while the government was in the hands of statesmen who were endeavouring  to transform Turkey into a modern state and who had introduced all sorts  of Western political innovations, including a parliament. Abdul Hamid,  however, soon changed all this. Taking advantage of the confusion which  marked the close of the Russian war, he abolished parliament and made  himself as absolute a despot as any of his ancestors had ever been.  Secure in his autocratic power, Abdul Hamid now began to evolve his own  peculiar policy, which, from the first, had a distinctly Pan-Islamic  trend[45]. Unlike his immediate predecessors, Abdul Hamid determined to  use his position as caliph for far-reaching political ends. Emphasizing  his spiritual headship of the Mohammedan world rather than his political  headship of the Turkish state, he endeavoured to win the active support  of all Moslems and, by that support, to intimidate European Powers who  might be formulating aggressive measures against the Ottoman Empire.  Before long Abdul Hamid had built up an elaborate Pan-Islamic propaganda  organization, working mainly by secretive, tortuous methods.  Constantinople became the Mecca of all the fanatics and anti-Western  agitators like Djemal-ed-Din. And from Constantinople there went forth  swarms of picked emissaries, bearing to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],[0,"Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#11)"],[1,"and where there will be no necessity of       going Through the tiresome Talk of addressing Parents or Guardians       for their consent: Such a one by leaving a Line directed for A.

They were sometimes prefaced by the solemn warning: \"Cursed be he that  parteth man & wife & all the people shall say Amen.\" Some very  disagreeable allegations were made against these Connecticut wives--that  they were rude, gay, light-carriaged girls, poor and lazy housewives,  ill cooks, fond of dancing, and talking balderdash talk, and far from  being loving consorts. The wives had something to say from their point  of view. One, owing to her spouse's stinginess, had to use \"Indian  branne for Jonne bred,\" and never tasted good food; another stated that  her loving husband \"cruelly pulled my hair, pinched my flesh, kicked me  out of bed, drag'd me by my arms & heels, flung ashes upon me to smother  me, flung water from the well till I had not a dry thread on me.\" All  these notices were apparently printed in the advertiser's own language  and individual manner of spelling, some even in rhyme. \"Timothy hubbard\"  thus ventilated his domestic infelicities and his spelling in the  _Connecticut Courant_ of January 30th, 1776:         \"Whearis my Wife Abigiel hes under Rote me by saying it is veri       Disagria bell to Hur to Expose to the World the miseris & Calamatis       of a Distractid famely, and I think as much for hur Father & mother       to Witt Stephen deming & his wife acts very much like Distractid or       BeWicht & I believe both, for the truth of this I will apell to the       Nabors.

My wife       pretends to say I abus'd her for the truth of this I will apiel to       all thare nabors.\"    Anenst this I am glad to add that I have found repentant sequels to the  mortifying story, in the form of humble retractions of the husband's  allegations. Wives were, on the whole, marvellously well protected by  early laws. A husband could not keep his consort on outlying and  danger-filled plantations, but must \"bring her in, else the town will  pull his house down.\" Nor could a man leave his wife for any length of  time, nor \"marrie too wifes which were both alive for anything that can  appear otherwise at one time,\" nor beat his wife (as he could to his  heart's content in old England); he could not even use \"hard words\" to  her. Nor could she raise her hand or use \"a curst and shrewish tongue\"  to him without fear of public punishment in the stocks or pillory.    In the first years of the colonies there existed a formal ceremony of  betrothal called in Plymouth a pre-contract. This semi-binding ceremony  had hardly a favorable influence upon the morals of the times. Cotton  Mather states:         \"There was maintained a Solemnity called a Contraction a little       before the Consummation of a marriage was allowed of. A Pastor was       usually employed and a sermon also preached on this occasion.\"    If the prospective marriage were an important or a genteel one, an  applicable sermon was often preached in church at the time of the  \"contraction.\" One minister took the text, Ephesians vi. 10, 11, in  order \"to teach that marriage is a state of warfaring condition.\" It was  also the custom to allow the bride to choose the text for the sermon to  be delivered on the Sunday when she \"came out bride.\" Much ingenuity was  exercised by these Puritan brides in finding appropriate and interesting  texts for these wedding sermons. Here are some of the verses selected:    2 Chronicles xiv. 2: \"And Asa did that which was good and right in the  eyes of the Lord\"--Asa and his bride Hepzibah sitting up proudly in the  congregation to listen.    Proverbs xxiv. 23: \"Her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth  among the elders of the land.\"    Ecclesiastes iv. 9, 10: \"Two are better than one; because they have a  good reward for their labour. For if they fall the one will lift up his  fellow.\"    I can imagine the staid New England lover and his shy sweetheart  anxiously and solemnly searching for many hours through the great  leather-bound family Bible for a specially appropriate text, turning  over the leaves and slowing scanning the pages, skipping over tedious  Leviticus and Numbers, and finding always in the Song of Solomon \"in  almost every verse\" a sentiment appealing to all lovers, and worthy a  selection for a wedding sermon.    The \"coming out,\" or, as it was called in Newburyport, \"walking out\" of  the bride was an important event in the little community. Cotton Mather  wrote in 1713 that he thought it expedient for the bridal couple to  appear as such publicly, with some dignity. We see in the pages of  Sewall's diary one of his daughters with her new-made husband leading  the orderly bridal procession of six couples on the way to church,  observed of all in the narrow Boston street and in the Puritan  meeting-house. In some communities the bride and groom took a prominent  seat in the gallery, and in the midst of the sermon rose to their feet  and turned around several times slowly, in order to show from every  point of view their bridal finery to the admiring eyes of their  assembled friends and neighbors in the congregation.    Throughout New England, except in New Hampshire, the law was enforced  for nearly two centuries, of publishing the wedding banns three times in  the meeting-house, at either town meeting, lecture, or Sunday service.  Intention of marriage and the names of the contracting parties were read  by the town clerk, the deacon, or the minister, at any of these  forgatherings, and a notice of the same placed on the church door, or on  a \"publishing post\"--in short, they were \"valled.\" Yet in the early days  of the colonies the all-powerful minister could not perform the marriage  ceremony--a magistrate, a captain, any man of dignity in the community  could be authorized to marry Puritan lovers, save the parson. Not till  the beginning of the eighteenth century did the Puritan minister assume  the function of solemnizing marriages. Gov. Bellingham married himself  to Penelope Pelham when he was a short time a widower and forty-nine  years old, and his bride but twenty-two. When he was \"brought up\" for  this irregularity he arrogantly and monopolizingly persisted in  remaining on the bench to try his own case. \"Disorderly marriages\" were  punished in many towns; doubtless many of them were between Quakers.  Some couples were fined every month until they were properly married. A  very trying and unregenerate reprobate in New London persisted that he  would \"take up\" with a woman in the town and make her his wife without  any legal or religious ceremony. This was a great scandal to the whole  community. A pious magistrate met the ungodly couple on the street and  sternly reproved them thus: \"John Rogers, do you persist in calling this  woman, a servant, so much younger than yourself, your wife?\"    \"Yes, I do,\" violently answered John.    \"And do you, Mary, wish such an old man as this to be your husband?\"    \"Indeed I do,\" she answered.    \"Then,\" said the governor, coldly, \"by the laws of God and this  commonwealth, I as a magistrate pronounce you man and wife.\"    \"Ah! Gurdon, Gurdon,\" said the groom, married legally in spite of  himself, \"thee's a cunning fellow.\"    There is one peculiarity of the marriages of the first century and a  half of colonial and provincial life which should be noted--the vast  number of unions between the members of the families of Puritan  ministers. It seemed to be a law of social ethics that the sons of  ministers should marry the daughters of ministers. The new pastor  frequently married the daughter of his predecessor in the parish,  sometimes the widow--a most thrifty settling of pastoral affairs. A  study of the Cotton, Stoddard, Eliot, Williams, Edwards, Chauncey,  Bulkeley, and Wigglesworth families, and, above all, of the Mather  family, will show mutual kinship among the ministers, as well as mutual  religious thought.    Richard Mather took for his second wife the widow of John Cotton. Their  children, Increase Mather and Mary Cotton, grew up as brother and  sister, but were married and became the parents of Cotton Mather. The  sons and grandsons and great-grandsons of Richard Mather were ministers.  His daughters, granddaughters, and great-granddaughters became the wives  of ministers. Thus was the name of \"Mather Dynasty\" well given. The  Mather blood and the Mather traits of character were felt in the most  remote parishes of New England. The Mather expressions of religious  thought were long heard from the pulpit, and long taught in ministerial  homes; and to that Mather blood and that upright Mather character and  God-fearing Mather faith and teaching, we of New England owe more  gratitude than can ever find expression.
