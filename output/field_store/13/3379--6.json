At the eastern end, above the altar, one of the window recesses has the  socket of an old iron hinge within it, and otherwise shows signs of  having been formerly occupied by a door, which may possibly have been  the original entrance. It is supposed that all the windows were left  unglazed for the sake of ventilation, but plain glass is now inserted.  The recesses are very deeply splayed in the thickness of the walls, and  it will be noticed that the exterior openings are above the level of the  roof, so as to admit the daylight obliquely, an ingenious contrivance to  intensify the solemnities within, where an artificial light is almost a  necessity. The plain bands of stone which constitute the vaulting are  supported by shallow piers, or pilasters, built against the lateral  walls, and all alike in their general structure and moulded bases; but  there is a curious difference between those on the north and south,  which has given rise to some antiquarian speculation. In one case (the  north) the pilasters are carried down to the floor: in the other they  rest upon a stone plinth or skirting a few inches above it.    #The Cloister#, as next in importance to the church itself, and so  characteristic of a monastic foundation as to give a name to the whole,  was in all probability begun by Rahere, or at least some time in the  twelfth century. This may be inferred from the Norman work found and  preserved at the restoration--at present confined to three bays of the  eastern side, at right angles to the south wall of the church. The  cloister was originally continued parallel with this wall to the  extremity of the nave, whence it extended in the usual quadrangular  form, each side consisting of eight bays, enclosing the area known as  the cloister-garth. That there was a reconstruction under Prior John  Watford, early in the fifteenth century, is clear from the evidence  already given, which is confirmed by the architectural remains within  the restored fragment--all that was in existence, as a ruin, when the  renovation was attempted.    [Illustration: THE REMAINING BAYS OF THE CLOISTER                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    The entrance is through a round-headed doorway in the south aisle--an  interesting piece of Norman work--but the doors are probably those  inserted during the fifteenth century reconstruction. It seems that they  were taken out when the nave was destroyed, and fitted to the main  entrance in the wall then built at the west end. Subsequently stored  within the church among the lumber which might possibly come in useful,  they were found exactly to fit the opening into the cloister, where they  were re-hung in what seems to be their proper place. The first bay on  the right, which formerly opened into the northern side of the  quadrangle, is now occupied by a blank wall, with some fifteenth century  work on each side, and the Tudor door-jambs within it, supposed to have  been inserted by the Dominican Friars in their restoration of the  following century. The second and third bays contain windows, with very  fine modern tracery in the headings, and some old Perpendicular work  retained at the sides. The wall on the left (eastern) side shows a  similar intermixture of styles in its three unlighted bays. The  elaborately vaulted roof is for the most part new, but a few of the old  bosses, and some portions of the original vaulting-shafts recovered  during the excavations, have been incorporated into it, without  renovation of their surfaces, so that the ancient and modern can be  easily distinguished. The new bosses are sculptured with shields bearing  respectively the royal arms, the arms of the Diocese, the Priory, the  late Rector (Sir Borradaile Savory), and the City of London. The Priory  arms form the central point in the vaulting, surrounded by smaller  bosses containing the emblems of the four Evangelists.    On a table at the end of the cloister there is a small collection of  stones and encaustic tiles from the old building, and some more precious  relics in a case. These include a few broken pieces of stained glass,  the metal seal struck by Father Perrin for the Dominicans, a book of  \"Spiritual Exercises\" by the same Prior, and a charred fragment of  Rahere's coffin and sandal, which had been surreptitiously taken from  his tomb.    Before leaving the church, the visitor is recommended to look through  the scrap-book of old engravings in charge of the verger, showing the  buildings in various phases of their history since the Dissolution.  These interesting pictures were presented anonymously, but a note on the  fly-leaf by Dr. Norman Moore, dated 23rd May, 1885, informs us that the  donor was William Morrant Baker, F.R.C.S., Surgeon to St. Bartholomew's  Hospital, Lecturer on Physiology, and Warden of its College. There is a  tablet to his memory in the Church of St. Bartholomew-the-Less.    A special permit is required for an inspection of the church registers.  They date from 1616, and show an average death-rate of ten in each month  till the year 1665, when the Plague of London brought up the entries to  about eighteen on each day.    The interior of the church presents an interesting perspective from  almost any point. A good general view may be obtained from the  north-east or south-west corner, and another from the organ-gallery,  which is recommended as commanding features not well seen from below in  the scanty light.      FOOTNOTES:     [1] This altar is an interesting piece of (Jacobean?) woodwork       which has recently been uncovered. The low recess in which it       stands seems better suited for a tomb, or recumbent effigy,       while the more lofty recess against the eastern wall,       originally supposed to have been open to the Walden Chantry,       would hold the altar admirably, and give it the proper       orientation.     [2] There are two large canvases of his on the staircase of the       Hospital representing \"The Pool of Bethesda\" and \"The Good       Samaritan,\" besides four smaller paintings, one of which gives       \"Rahere's Dream,\" and another \"The Building of the Priory.\"     [3] The manor of Canonbury, formerly included in the Priory       estates, is said to have been presented to the community by Sir       Ralph de Berners in the reign of Edward III. The Prior and       canons built themselves a mansion there as a country residence,       and there is no doubt that the place takes its name from their       connection with it. According to Stow (_Ed. Strype_, vol. 1),       the manor-house was rebuilt by Prior Bolton, whose rebus on the       walls of the tower seemed to prove that it was either his work,       or erected shortly after his time to his memory. The house is a       plain brick structure with gable ends, and the tower (of the       same material) covers a rather large square. The spacious rooms       within it have some literary interest, as at one time occupied       by Ephraim Chambers, the encyclopaedist (1680-1750), and by the       more famous Oliver Goldsmith. The whole building, renovated       within and without, is now held by a social club. For many       years a fable was believed that a subterranean passage       connected it with the Smithfield Priory.     [4] The new bronze railing to the sanctuary forms part of the       memorial to the late Rector, the Rev. Sir Borradaile Savory,       Bart. It is in the Renaissance style, and the words from the       _Gloria in Excelsis_ (\"We praise Thee,\" etc.), in each of its       four divisions, were selected by his successor, the present       Rector, as suitable to the place, and expressing the governing       principle of Sir Borradaile's life, as well as that of Rahere       the Founder.     [5] The substructure in the chamber of the Pix, at Westminster,       will be remembered among the surviving examples of this early       kind of vaulting in England.     [6] Francis Anthony (1550-1623) lived in Bartholomew Close. He       had obtained the M.A. degree at Cambridge, but none in       medicine, and having practised for six months in London without       a licence, he was summoned before the President and Censors of       the College of Physicians to give an account of himself.       Failing to satisfy his examiners, he was interdicted from       practice, but ignored the prohibition, and suffered more than       one imprisonment in consequence. The medicine \"of purest gold\"       was a panacea, known as _Aurum potabile_, which was supposed to       be made from the precious metal, and certainly put a great deal       of it into the inventor's pocket, as a fashionable remedy for       all kinds of diseases.         (See article in the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" for a       sketch of his life.)     [7] A tablet, in the Renaissance style, has recently been       affixed to the north wall in memory of Sir Borradaile Savory,       Bart., the late Rector. It was unveiled and formally dedicated       by the Bishop of Stepney, on Sunday, 10th May, 1908.           *       *       *       *       *      [Illustration: ST.

It was to the hospital on this island that Rahere was sent  for medical treatment in his illness; and it is possible that the  disposing cause of his vision, with its practical outcome, may be found  in the circumstances of the place. The island had been dedicated to  Aesculapius on the strength of an ancient Roman legend; and about the  year 1000 the Emperor Otho III,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21528"],[0,"The International Monthly Magazine, Volume 1,  No. 1, August 1850 (#11)"],[1,"_Igea Borbonica_, has discovered a new telescope planet, being the ninth  between Mars and Jupiter.

SMYTH, D.D. of South Carolina, whose work upon the  Unity of the Human Races, suggested by the recent declarations of  infidelity, by Professor Agassiz of Harvard College and others, has been  published by Putnam, and received with a hearty applause by Christians  and scholars, is not, as is commonly supposed, an American author,  though he has long resided in this country. He was born in Belfast, in  the North of Ireland, and educated at the Royal College in that city,  pursuing afterward his theological studies in London, and at Princeton  in New Jersey. He has been eighteen years minister of the Presbyterian  church in Charleston, where he was married, and where he will probably  always reside, while in this country; but his liberal fortune and  inquiring spirit tempt him to frequent travel, and he is now absent upon  a tour which will probably be extended to Nineveh and all the most  interesting scenes connected with the history of religion in the eastern  world. Dr. Smyth possesses one of the largest and most valuable private  libraries in the United States, and has therefore been able to compose  his learned works in theology, history, &c. under advantages but seldom  enjoyed by our authors. His chief productions are, Apostolical  Succession, 1842; Presbytery and not Prelacy the Scriptural and  Primitive Polity of the Church, 1843; Ecclesiastical Republicanism;  Ecclesiastical Catechism; Claims of the Free Church of Scotland; Life  and Character of Thomas Chalmers, with Personal Recollections; Nature  and Functions of Ruling Elders; Nature and Functions of Deacons; The  Rite of Confirmation examined; Bereaved Parents Consoled; Union to  Christ and His Church; The True Origin and Source of the Mecklenburg  Declaration of Independence, with a Continuation on Presbyterianism, the  National Declaration, and the Revolution; Denominational Education;  Pastoral Memento; Life and Character of Calvin; The Westminster  Assembly; and the Unity of the Human Races proved to be the Doctrine of  Scripture, Reason, and Science. Dr. Smyth has also written largely in  the Biblical Repertory, the Southern Presbyterian Review, and other  Periodicals.           *       *       *       *       *    THE VETERAN ITALIAN GENERAL PEPE, known in the book-world heretofore by  his Personal Memoirs, has just published a Narrative of Scenes and  Events in Italy, from 1847 to 1849. It comprises the most interesting  particulars respecting the Revolutions in Naples, Sicily, and Rome; the  Military Operations of Charles Albert; and the Siege of Venice, of which  city General Pepe held the command. It also includes the details of the  General's confidential communications and interviews with the Italian  Sovereigns, &c. &c.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. MAYNE REID, who in sundry letters published in this city last year,  claimed that he was the real hero of the Mexican war--in which he served  as a lieutenant of the New York volunteers--has recently published in  London a brace of volumes under the title of _The Rifle Rangers_. In his  preface he alleges that all his statements offered as facts are strictly  true, though at times highly colored for the sake of effect. This will  be obvious to every reader, for the book is full of adventures of all  sorts--perils by sword, fire, rivals, wild animals, bloodhounds,  &c.--which are related in a lively, dashing style, varied at times with  descriptions of the scenery, plants, and inhabitants of Central America.  One of the London journals, in a review of it, observes, \"We would not  wish a more lively or interesting companion than Captain Reid,--a  _thorough Yankee soldier_, combining humor, imagination, and dashing  bravery in the highest degree.\" The thorough Yankee, like many others  much quoted abroad, is a clever Irish adventurer, who was in the United  States altogether some four or five years, engaged chiefly as a writer  for the journals in New York and Philadelphia.           *       *       *       *       *    Among our frequent foreign correspondents the reader will be pleased to  recognize the accomplished and adventurous traveler Mr. JOHN E.

Dr. Hawks may be safely regarded as an  authority of the very highest value, upon whatever relates to the  religious and social history of the country. He adds to persevering and  well-directed research the soundest discrimination, and a judicial  fairness; and we trust an impression which has obtained within a few  years, that he is engaged upon an extensive work that will illustrate  his abilities in this field, is not without foundation.           *       *       *       *       *    The celebrated Princess BELGIOSO, whose achievements in the tented  field, as in the showy salons of fashion, have long been familiar, has,  as is well known in the gay world of Europe, been a successful  cultivator of letters, and has frequently delighted the readers of  French and Italian with brilliant sketches of society and manners. She  is now traveling in Greece, whence she will proceed into the romantic  and picturesque regions of Asia, and the proprietors of the _New York  Tribune_ have engaged her as one of the regular foreign correspondents  of that journal.           *       *       *       *       *    M. EUGENE SCRIBE, the writer of the libretto of _Tempesta_, just brought  out in London, at the age of eighteen years, was placed under the care  of M. Dupin, now the President of the French Legislative Assembly, to  study the Roman law. Shortly after reaching his majority he began his  dramatic career by writing a vaudeville for the Gymnase. His success  here led to an engagement to write for the Theatre Francais, and to the  establishment of his reputation as a dramatic author. He has composed  ten comedies in five acts, and twenty in one, two, or three acts, for  the Francais. He has written one hundred and fifty vaudevilles for the  Gymnase. As a lyrical poet he stands unequalled for the number of his  _libretti_, having written the poetry of forty grand operas and of one  hundred comic operas. His works, exclusive of novels, are three hundred  and forty in number.           *       *       *       *       *    The Literature of the Western States has not yet furnished any name that  shines with a fairer and serener lustre than that of ALICE CAREY,  several of whose poems, of \"imagination all compact,\" and faultless in  rhythmical art, will live among the contributions which this age offers  to the permanent in literary creation. Her younger sister, PH[OE]BE  CAREY, is also a woman of genius, and has written almost as largely as  Alice, in a similar vein of thought and feeling.
