One side of the room lay in blackest darkness; through the  furthermost window of the other a faint yellowed luminance (the  moonlight through the blind) spread upon the polished parquet  flooring.  But that which held the curator spell-bound--that which  momentarily quickened into life the latent superstition, common to  all mankind, was a beam of cold light which poured its effulgence  fully upon the case containing the Prophet's slipper!  Where the  other exhibits lay either in utter darkness or semi-darkness this  one it seemed was supernaturally picked out by this lunar  searchlight!    It was ghostly-unnerving; but, the first dread of it passed, Mostyn  recalled how during the day a hole inexplicably had been cut in  that blind; he recalled that it had not been mended, but that the  damaged blind had merely been rolled up again.    And as a dawning perception of the truth came to him, as falteringly  he advanced a step toward the mystic beam, he saw that one side of  the case had been shattered--he saw the broken glass upon the floor;  and in the dense shadow behind and under the beam of light, vaguely  he saw a dull red object.    It moved--it seemed to live!  It moved away from the case and in  the direction of the eastern windows.    \"My God!\" whispered Mostyn; \"it's the Prophet's slipper!\"    And wildly, blindly, he fired down the room.  Later he knew that he  had fired in panic, for nothing human was or could be in the place;  yet his shot was not without effect.  In the instant of its flash,  something struck sharply against the dimly seen blind of one of the  east windows; he heard the crash of broken glass.    He leapt to the switch and flooded the room with light.  A fear of  what it might hold possessed him, and he turned instantly.    Hard by the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and midway  between the case and the first easterly window lay the slipper.  A  bell was ringing somewhere.  His shot probably had aroused the  attention of the policeman.  Someone was clamouring upon the door  of the Museum, too.  Mostyn raced forward and raised the blind--that  toward which the slipper had seemed to move.    The lower pane of the window was smashed.  Blood was trickling down  upon the floor from the jagged edges of the glass.    \"Hullo there!  Open the door!  Open the door!\"    Bells were going all over the place now; sounds of running footsteps  came from below; but Mostyn stood staring at the broken window and  at the solid iron bars which protected it without, which were intact,  substantial--which showed him that nothing human could possibly  have entered.    Yet the case was shattered, the holy slipper lay close beside him  upon the floor, and from the broken window-pane blood was  falling--drip-drip-drip...    That was the story as I heard it half an hour later.  For Inspector  Bristol, apprised of the happening, was promptly on the scene; and  knowing how keen was my interest in the matter, he rang me up  immediately.  I arrived soon after Bristol and found a perplexed  group surrounding the uncanny slipper of the Prophet.  No one had  dared to touch it; the dread vengeance of Hassan of Aleppo would  visit any unbeliever who ventured to lay hand upon the holy, bloody  thing.  Well we knew it, and as though it had been a venomous  scorpion we, a company of up-to-date, prosaic men of affairs, stood  around that dilapidated markoob, and kept a respectful distance.    Mostyn, an odd figure in pyjamas and dressing-gown, turned his pale,  intellectual face to me as I entered.    \"It will have to be put back ... secretly,\" he said.    His voice was very unsteady.  Bristol nodded grimly and glanced at  the two constables, who, with a plain-clothes man unknown to me,  made up that midnight company.    \"I'll do it, sir,\" said one of the constables suddenly.    \"One moment\"--Mostyn raised his hand!    In the ensuing silence I could hear the heavy breathing of those  around me.  We were all looking at the slipper, I think.    \"Do you understand, fully,\" the curator continued, \"the risk you  run?\"    \"I think so, sir,\" answered the constable; \"but I'm prepared to  chance it.\"    \"The hands,\" resumed Mostyn slowly, \"of those who hitherto have  ventured to touch it have been\"--he hesitated--\"cut off.\"    \"Your career in the Force would be finished if it happened to you,  my lad,\" said Bristol shortly.    \"I suppose they'd look after me,\" said the man, with grim humour.    \"They would if you met with--an accident, in the discharge of your  duty,\" replied the inspector; \"but I haven't ordered you to do it,  and I'm not going to.\"    \"All right, sir,\" said the man, with a sort of studied truculence,  \"I'll take my chance.\"    I tried to stop him; Mostyn, too, stepped forward, and Bristol  swore frankly.  But it was all of no avail.    A sort of chill seemed to claim my very soul when I saw the  constable stoop, unconcernedly pick up the slipper, and replace it  in the broken case.    It was out of a silence cathedral-like, awesome, that he spoke.    \"All you want is a new pane of glass, sir,\" he said--\"and the  thing's done.\"    I anticipate in mentioning it here; but since Constable Hughes  has no further place in these records I may perhaps be excused for  dismissing him at this point.    He was picked up outside the section house on the following evening  with his right hand severed just above the wrist.          CHAPTER XIV    A SCREAM IN THE NIGHT      The day that followed was one of the hottest which we experienced  during the heat wave.  It was a day crowded with happenings.  The  Burton Room was closed to the public, whilst a glazier worked upon  the broken east window and a new blind was fitted to the west.  Behind the workmen, guarded by a watchful commissionaire, yawned  the shattered case containing the slipper.    I wondered if the visitors to the other rooms of the Museum realized,  as I realized, that despite the blazing sunlight of tropical  London, the shadow of Hassan of Aleppo lay starkly on that haunted  building?    At about eleven o'clock, as I hurried along the Strand, I almost  collided with the girl of the violet eyes!  She turned and ran like  the wind down Arundel Street, whilst I stood at the corner staring  after her in blank amazement, as did other passers-by; for a man  cannot with dignity race headlong after a pretty woman down a  public thoroughfare!    My mystification grew hourly deeper; and Bristol wallowed in  perplexities.    \"It's the most horrible and confusing case,\" he said to me when  I joined him at the Museum, \"that the Yard has ever had to handle.  It bristles with outrages and murders.  God knows where it will  all end.  I've had London scoured for a clue to the whereabouts  of Hassan and Company and drawn absolutely blank!  Then there's  Earl Dexter.  Where does he come in?  For once in a way he's  living in hiding.  I can't find his headquarters.  I've been  thinking--\"    He drew me aside into the small gallery which runs parallel with  the Assyrian Room.    \"Dexter has booked two passages in the Oceanic.  Who is his  companion?\"    I wondered, I had wondered more than once, if his companion were  my beautiful violet-eyed acquaintance.  A scruple--perhaps an  absurd scruple--hitherto had kept me silent respecting her, but  now I determined to take Bristol fully into my confidence.  A  conviction was growing upon me that she and Earl Dexter together  represented that third party whose existence we had long suspected.  Whether they operated separately or on behalf of the Moslems (of  which arrangement I could not conceive) remained to be seen.  I  was about to voice my doubts and suspicions when Bristol went on  hurriedly--    \"I have thoroughly examined the Burton Room, and considering that  the windows are thirty feet from the ground, that there is no sign  of a ladder having stood upon the lawn, and that the iron bars are  quite intact, it doesn't look humanly possible for any one to have  been in the room last night prior to Mostyn's arrival!\"    \"One of the dwarfs--\"    \"Not even one of the dwarfs,\" said Bristol, \"could have passed  between those iron bars!\"    \"But there was blood on the window!\"    \"I know there was, and human blood.  It's been examined!\"    He stared at me fixedly.  The thing was unspeakably uncanny.    \"To-night,\" he went on, \"I am remaining in here\"--nodding toward  the Assyrian Room--\"and I have so arranged it that no mortal being  can possibly know I am here.  Mostyn is staying, and you can stay,  too, if you care to.  Owing to Professor Deeping's will you are  badly involved in the beastly business, and I have no doubt you are  keen to see it through.\"    \"I am,\" I admitted, \"and the end I look for and hope for is the  recovery of the slipper by its murderous owners!\"    \"I am with you,\" said Bristol.  \"It's just a point of honour; but  I should be glad to make them a present of it.  We're ostentatiously  placing a constable on duty in the hallway to-night--largely as a  blind.  It will appear that we're taking no other additional  precautions.\"    He hurried off to make arrangements for my joining him in his watch,  and thus again I lost my opportunity of confiding in him regarding  the mysterious girl.    I half anticipated, though I cannot imagine why, that Earl Dexter  would put in an appearance, during the day.  He did not do so,  however, for Bristol had put a constable on the door who was well  acquainted with the appearance of The Stetson Man.  The inspector,  in the course of his investigations, had come upon what might have  been a clue, but what was at best a confusing one.  Close by the  wall of the curator's house and lying on the gravel path he had  found a part of a gold cuff link.  It was of American manufacture.

Having reached this point in his  philosophizing the Bibliotaph's player-friend became sentimental and  quoted a great comedian to the effect that 'a dead actor was a mighty  useless thing.' 'Certainly,' said the Bibliotaph, 'having exhausted  the life that now is, and having no hope of the life that is to come.'    Sometimes it pleased the Bibliotaph to maintain that his friend of the  footlights would be in the future state a mere homeless wanderer,  having neither positive satisfaction nor positive discomfort. For the  actor was wont to insist that even if there were an orthodox heaven  its moral opposite were the desirable locality; all the clever and  interesting fellows would be down below. 'Except yourself,' said the  Bibliotaph. 'You, sir, will be eliminated by your own reasoning. You  will be denied heaven because you are not good, and hell because you  are not great.'    On the whole it pleased the Bibliotaph to maintain that his friend's  course was downward, and that the sooner he reconciled himself to his  undoubted fate the better. 'Why speculate upon it?' he said paternally  to the actor, 'your prospective comparisons will one day yield to  reminiscent contrasts.'    The actor was convinced that the Bibliotaph's own past life needed  looking into, and he declared that when he got a chance he was going  to examine the great records. To which the Bibliotaph promptly  responded: 'The books of the recording angel will undoubtedly be open  to your inspection if you can get an hour off to come up. The  probability is that you will be overworked.'    The Bibliotaph never lost an opportunity for teasing. He arrived late  one evening at the house of a friend where he was always heartily  welcome, and before answering the chorus of greetings, proceeded to  kiss the lady of the mansion, a queenly and handsome woman. Being  asked why he--who was a large man and very shy with respect to women,  as large men always are--should have done this thing, he answered that  the kiss had been sent by a common friend and that he had delivered it  at once, 'for if there was anything he prided himself upon it was a  courageous discharge of an unpleasant duty.'    Once when he had been narrating this incident he was asked what reply  the lady had made to so uncourteous a speech. 'I don't remember,' said  the Bibliotaph, 'it was long ago; but my opinion is that she would  have been justified in denominating me by a monosyllable beginning  with the initial letter of the alphabet and followed by successive  sibilants.'    One of the Bibliotaph's fellow book-hunters owned a chair said to have  been given by Sir Edwin Landseer to Sir Walter Scott. The chair was  interesting to behold, but the Bibliotaph after attempting to sit in  it immediately got up and declared that it was not a genuine relic:  'Sir Edwin had reason to be grateful to rather than indignant at Sir  Walter Scott.'    He said of a highly critical person that if that man were to become a  minister he would probably announce as the subject of his first  sermon: 'The conditions that God must meet in order to be acceptable  to me.' He said of a poor orator who had copyrighted one of his most  indifferent speeches, that the man 'positively suffered from an excess  of caution.' He remarked once that the great trouble with a certain  lady was 'she labored under the delusion that she enjoyed occasional  seasons of sanity.'    The _nil admirari_ attitude was one which he never affected, and he  had a contempt for men who denied to the great in literature and art  that praise which was their due. This led him to say apropos of an  obscure critic who had assailed one of the poetical masters: 'When the  Lord makes a man a fool he injures him; but when He so constitutes him  that the man is never happy unless he is making that fact public, He  insults him.'    He enjoyed speculating on the subject of marriage, especially in the  presence of those friends who unlike himself knew something about it  empirically. He delighted to tell his lady acquaintances that their  husbands would undoubtedly marry a second time if they had the chance.  It was inevitable. A man whose experience has been fortunate is bound  to marry again, because he is like the man who broke the bank at Monte  Carlo. A man who has been unhappily married marries again because like  an unfortunate gamester he has reached the time when his luck has got  to change. The Bibliotaph then added with a smile: 'I have the idea  that many men who marry a second time do in effect what is often done  by unsuccessful gamblers at Monte Carlo; they go out and commit  suicide.'    The Bibliotaph played but few games. There was one, however, in which  he was skillful. I blush to speak of it in these days of much muscular  activity. What have golfers, and tennis-players, and makers of century  runs to do with croquet? Yet there was a time when croquet was spoken  of as 'the coming game;' and had not Clintock's friend Jennings  written an epic poem upon it in twelve books, which poem he offered to  lend to a certain brilliant young lady? But Gwendolen despised boys  and cared even less for their poetry than for themselves.    At the house of the Country Squire the Bibliotaph was able to gratify  his passion for croquet, and verily he was a master. He made a  grotesque figure upon the court, with his big frame which must stoop  mightily to take account of balls and short-handled mallets, with his  agile manner, his uncovered head shaggy with its barbaric profusion of  hair (whereby some one was led to nickname him Bibliotaph Indetonsus),  with the scanty black alpaca coat in which he invariably played--a  coat so short in the sleeves and so brief in the skirt that the figure  cut by the wearer might almost have passed for that of Mynheer Ten  Broek of many-trowsered memory. But it was vastly more amusing to  watch him than to play with him. He had a devil 'most undoubted.' Only  with the help of black art and by mortgaging one's soul would it have  been possible to accomplish some of the things which he accomplished.  For the materials of croquet are so imperfect at best that chance is  an influential element. I've seen tennis-players in the intervals of  _their_ game watch the Bibliotaph with that superior smile suggestive  of contempt for the puerility of his favorite sport. They might even  condescend to take a mallet for a while to amuse _him_; but presently  discomfited they would retire to a game less capricious than croquet  and one in which there was reasonable hope that a given cause would  produce its wonted effect.    The Bibliotaph played strictly for the purpose of winning, and took  savage joy in his conquests. In playing with him one had to do two  men's work; one must play, and then one must summon such philosophy as  one might to suffer continuous defeat, and such wit as one possessed  to beat back a steady onslaught of daring and witty criticisms. 'I  play like a fool,' said a despairing opponent after fruitless effort  to win a just share of the games. 'We all have our moments of  unconsciousness,' purred the Bibliotaph blandly in response. This same  despairing opponent, who was an expert in everything he played, said  that there was but one solace after croquet with the Bibliotaph; he  would go home and read Hazlitt's essay on the Indian Jugglers.           *       *       *       *       *    Here ends the account of the Bibliotaph. From these inadequate notes  it is possible to get some little idea of his habits and conversation.  The library is said to be still growing. Packages of books come  mysteriously from the corners of the earth and make their way to that  remote and almost inaccessible village where the great collector hides  his treasures. No one has ever penetrated that region, and no one, so  far as I am aware, has ever seen the treasures. The books lie  entombed, as it were, awaiting such day of resurrection as their owner  shall appoint them. The day is likely to be long delayed. Of the  collector's whereabouts now no one of his friends dares to speak  positively; for at the time when knowledge of him was most exact THE  BIBLIOTAPH was like a newly-discovered comet,--his course was  problematical.          THOMAS HARDY      I    'The reason why so few good books are written is that so few people  that can write know anything.' So said a man who, during a busy  career, found time to add several fine volumes to the scanty number of  good books. And in a vivacious paragraph which follows this initial  sentence he humorously anathematizes the literary life. He shows  convincingly that 'secluded habits do not tend to eloquence.' He says  that the 'indifferent apathy' so common among studious persons is by  no means favorable to liveliness of narration. He proves that men who  will not live cannot write; that people who shut themselves up in  libraries have dry brains. He avows his confidence in the 'original  way of writing books,' the way of the first author, who must have  looked at things for himself, 'since there were no books for him to  copy from;' and he challenges the reader to prove that this original  way is not the best way. 'Where,' he asks, 'are the amusing books from  voracious students and habitual writers?'    This startling arraignment of authors has been made by other men than  Walter Bagehot. Hazlitt in his essay on the 'Ignorance of the Learned'  teaches much the same doctrine. Its general truth is indisputable,  though Bagehot himself makes exception in favor of Sir Walter Scott.  But the two famous critics are united in their conviction that learned  people are generally dull, and that books which are the work of  habitual writers are not amusing.    There are as a matter of course more exceptions than one. Thomas Hardy  is a distinguished exception. Thomas Hardy is an "]]]
