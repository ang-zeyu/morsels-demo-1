SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES PILEATUS.  _The Capped Langur_.    HABITAT.--Assam, Chittagong, Tipperah.    DESCRIPTION.--General colour dark ashy grey, with a slight  ferruginous tint; darker near head and on shoulders; underneath and  on the inside of the limbs pale yellowish, with a darker shade of  orange or golden yellow on the breast and belly. The crown of the  head is densely covered with bristly hairs, regularly disposed and  somewhat elongated on the vertex so as to resemble a cap, whence the  name. Along the forehead is a superciliary crest of long black  bristles, directed outwardly; whiskers full and down to the chin:  behind the ears is a small tuft of white hairs; the tail is long,  one third longer than the body, darker near the end, and tufted;  fingers and toes black.    SIZE.--A little smaller than _P. entellus_.    This monkey is found in Northern Assam, Tipperah and southwards to  Tenasserim; in Blyth's 'Catalogue of the Mammals of Burmah' it is  mentioned as _P. chrysogaster_ (_Semnopithecus potenziani_ of  Bonaparte and Peters). He writes of it: \"Females and young have the  lower parts white, or but faintly tinted with ferruginous, and the  rest of the coat is of a pure grey; the face black, and there is no  crest, but the hairs of the crown are so disposed as to appear like  a small flat cap laid upon the top of the head. The old males seem  always to be of a deep rust-colour on the cheeks, lower parts, and  more or less on the outer side of the limbs; while in old females  this rust colour is diluted or little more than indicated.\"    Dr. Anderson says that a young one he had was of a mild disposition,  which however is not the character of the adult animal, which is  uncertain, and the males when irritated are fierce, and determined  in attack. No rule, however, is without its exception, for one adult  male, possessed by Blyth, is reported as having been an exceeding  gentle animal.      NO. 10. SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES BARBEI.  _The Tipperah Langur_.    HABITAT.--Tipperah, Tenasserim.    DESCRIPTION.--No vertical crest of hair on the head, nor is the  occipital hair directed downwards, as in the next species. Shoulders  and outside of arm silvered; tail slightly paler than body, \"which  is of a blackish fuliginous hue.\"    More information is required about this monkey, which was named by  Blyth after its donor to the Asiatic Society, the Rev. J. Barbe. Blyth  considered it as distinct from _P. Phayrei_ and _P. obscurus_, which  last is from Malacca.    Dr. Anderson noticed it in the valley of the Tapeng in the centre  of the Kakhyen Hills, in troops of thirty to fifty, in high forest  trees overhanging the mountain streams. Being seldom disturbed, they  permitted a near approach.      NO. 11. SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES PHAYREI.  _Syn_.--SEMNOPITHECUS CRISTATUS.  _The Silvery-Leaf Monkey_ (_Blyth_).    HABITAT.--Arracan, Malayan Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo.    DESCRIPTION.-Colour dusky grey-brown above, more or less dark, with  black hands and feet; a conspicuous crest on the vertex; under parts  white, scarcely extending to the inside of the limbs; sides grey like  the back; whiskers dark, very long, concealing the ears in front;  lips and eyelids conspicuously white, with white moustachial hairs  above and similar hairs below.    SIZE.--Two feet; tail, 2 feet 6 inches.    This monkey was named by Blyth after Captain (now Sir Arthur) Phayre,  who first brought it to his notice; but he afterwards reconciled it  as being synonymous with _Semnopithecus cristatus_. The colouring,  according to different authors, seems to vary considerably, which  causes some confusion in description. It differs from an allied  species, _S. maurus_, in selecting low marshy situations near the  banks of streams. Its favourite food is the fruit of the Nibong palm  (_Oncosperma filamentosa_).      NO. 12. SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES OBSCURUS.  _The Dusky-Leaf Monkey_.    HABITAT.--Mergui and the Malayan Peninsula.    DESCRIPTION.--Adults ashy or brownish black, darker on forehead,  sides of face, shoulder, and sides of body; the hair on the nape is  lengthened and whitish. The newly-born young are of a golden  ferruginous colour, which afterward changes to dusky-ash colour, the  terminal half of the tail being last to change; the mouth and eyelids  are whitish, but the rest of the face black.    SIZE.--Body, 1 foot 9 inches; tail, 2 feet 8 inches.    This monkey is most common in the Malayan Peninsula, but has been  found to extend to Mergui, where Blyth states it was procured by the  late Major Berdmore. Dr. Anderson says it is not unfrequently offered  for sale in the Singapore market.      NO. 13. SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES CEPHALOPTERUS.  _The Ceylon Langur_.    NATIVE NAME.--_Kallu Wanderu_.    HABITAT.--The low lands of Ceylon.    DESCRIPTION.--General colour cinereous black; croup and inside of  thighs whitish; head rufescent brown; hair on crown short,  semi-erect; occipital hairs long, albescent; whiskers white, thick  and long, terminating at the chin in a short beard, and laterally  angularly pointed; upper lip thinly fringed with white hairs;  superciliary hairs black, long, stiff and standing erect; tail  albescent and terminating in a beard tuft; face, palms, soles,  fingers, toes and callosities black; irides brown.--_Kellaart_.    SIZE.--Length, 20 inches; tail 24 inches.    Sir E. Tennent says of this monkey that it is never found at a higher  elevation than 1,300 feet (when it is replaced by the next species).    \"It is an active and intelligent creature, little larger than the  common bonneted macaque, and far from being so mischievous as others  of the monkeys in the island. In captivity it is remarkable for the  gravity of its demeanour and for an air of melancholy in its  expression and movements, which are completely in character with its  snowy beard and venerable aspect. In disposition it is gentle and  confiding, sensible in the highest degree of kindness, and eager for  endearing attention, uttering a low plaintive cry when its  sympathies are excited. It is particularly cleanly in its habits when  domesticated, and spends much of its time in trimming its fur and  carefully divesting its hair of particles of dust. Those which I kept  at my house near Colombo were chiefly fed upon plantains and bananas,  but for nothing did they evince a greater partiality than the  rose-coloured flowers of the red hibiscus (_H. rosa sinensis_).  These they devoured with unequivocal gusto; they likewise relished  the leaves of many other trees, and even the bark of a few of the  more succulent ones.\"      NO. 14. SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES URSINUS.  _The Great Wanderu_.    NATIVE NAME.--_Maha Wanderu_.    HABITAT.--The mountainous district of Ceylon.    DESCRIPTION.--Fur long, almost uniformly greyish black; whiskers  full and white; occiput and croup in old specimens paler coloured;  hands and feet blackish; tail long, getting lighter towards the lower  half. The young and adults under middle age have a rufous tint,  corresponding with that of the head of all ages.    SIZE.--Body about 22 inches; tail, 26 inches.    The name Wanderu is a corruption of the Singhalese generic word for  monkey, _Ouandura_, or _Wandura_, which bears a striking resemblance  to the Hindi _Bandra_, commonly called _Bandar_--_b_ and _v_ being  interchangeable--and is evidently derived from the Sanscrit _Banur_,  which in the south again becomes _Wanur_, and further south, in  Ceylon, _Wandura_. There has been a certain amount of confusion  between this animal and _Inuus silenus_, the lion monkey, which had  the name _Wanderu_ applied to it by Buffon, and it is so figured in  Cuvier. They are both large monkeys, with great beards of light  coloured hair, but in no other respect do they resemble. Sir Emerson  Tennent says: \"It is rarely seen by Europeans, this portion of the  country having till very recently been but partially opened; and even  now it is difficult to observe its habits, as it seldom approaches  the few roads which wind through these deep solitudes. At early  morning, ere the day begins to dawn, its loud and peculiar howl, which  consists of quick repetition of the sound _how-how!_ may be  frequently heard in the mountain jungles, and forms one of the  characteristic noises of these lofty situations.\" This was written  in 1861; since then much of the mountainous forest land has been  cleared for coffee-planting, and the Wanderu either driven into  corners or become more familiarised with man. More therefore must  be known of its habits by this time, and information regarding it  is desirable.      NO. 15. SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES THERSITES.    NATIVE NAME.--_Ellee Wanderu_ (Kellaart).    HABITAT.--Ceylon.    [Figure: _Presbytes thersites_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Chiefly distinguished from the others by wanting the  head tuft; uniform dusky grey, darker on crown and fore-limbs; slaty  brown on wrists and hands; hair on toes whitish; whiskers and beard  largely developed and conspicuously white.    The name was given by Blyth to a single specimen forwarded by Dr.  Templeton, and it was for a time doubtful whether it was really a  native, till Dr. Kellaart procured a second. Dr. Templeton's  specimen was partial to fresh vegetables, plantains, and fruit, but  he ate freely boiled rice, beans, and gram. He was fond of being  noticed and petted, stretching out his limbs in succession to be  scratched, drawing himself up so that his ribs might be reached by  the finger, closing his eyes during the operation, and evincing his  satisfaction by grimaces irresistibly ludicrous.--_Emerson  Tennent_.    Dr. Anderson considers this monkey as identical with _Semnopithecus  priamus_, but Kellaart, as I have before stated, is very positive  on the point of difference, calling _S. priamus_ emphatically the  crested monkey, and alleging that _thersites_ has no crest, and it  is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19552"],[0,"The Plattsburg Manual: A Handbook for Military Training (#11)"],[1,"ssary,  until the company becomes so reduced in numbers as to necessitate a new  division into squads. No squad will contain less than six men.    The company is further divided into two, three, or four platoons, each  consisting of not less than two nor more than four squads. In garrison  or ceremonies the strength of platoons may exceed four squads.    Platoons are assigned to the lieutenants and noncom-missioned officers,  in order of rank, as follows: 1, right; 2, left; 3, center (right  center); 4, left center.    The noncommissioned officers next in rank are assigned as guides, one  to each platoon. If sergeants still remain, they are assigned to  platoons as additional guides. When the platoon is deployed, its guide,  or guides, accompany the platoon leader.    The first sergeant is never assigned as a guide. When not commanding a  platoon, he is posted as a file closer opposite the third file from the  outer flank of the first platoon; and when the company is deployed he  accompanies the captain.    Musicians, when required to play, are at the head of the column. When  the company is deployed, they accompany the captain.    Guides and enlisted men in the line of file closers execute the manual  of arms during the drill unless especially excused, when they remain at  the order. During ceremonies they execute all movements.    In taking intervals and distances, unless otherwise directed, the  right and left guides, at the first command, place themselves in the  line of file closers, and, with them, take a distance of 4 paces from  the rear rank. In taking intervals, at the command march, the file  closers face to the flank and each steps off with the file nearest him.  In assembling the guides and file closers resume their positions in  line.    Being in line at a halt, the captain directs the first sergeant, dismiss  the company. The officers fall out; the first sergeant places himself  faced to the front, 3 paces to the front and 2 paces from the nearest  flank of the company, salutes, faces toward opposite flank of the  company, and commands: 1. Inspection, 2. ARMS, 3. Port, 4. ARMS, 3.  DISMISSED.    The alignments are executed as prescribed in the School of the Squad,  the guide being established instead of the flank file. The rear-rank man  of the flank file keeps his head and eyes to the front and covers his  file leader.    At each alignment the captain places himself in prolongation of the  line, 2 paces from and facing the flank toward which the dress is made,  verifies the alignment, and commands: FRONT.    Platoon leaders take a like position when required to verify alignments.        EXTENDED ORDER DRILLS      As soon as your progress in close order is sufficiently advanced, you  will be given extended order drill, which will teach you the formations  used in battle, and how a firing line is controlled. They are executed  at ease.    We should know the meaning of the two following terms: Base and Deploy.    Base. The element on which a movement is regulated. In company drill  it is usually the right or left; leading, rear, or center squad.    Deploy. To extend the front. The company deploys when it executes as  skirmishers.    There are really only two conditions that we must consider in this  drill. The movements are very easy to    [Illustration]    understand, but they require a lot of practice to prevent confusion.    First Case. Let us take the company in line at a halt. It is desired  to form a skirmish line to the front. 1. As skirmishers, guide right  (left or center), 2. MARCH.    At the preparatory command (i.e., as skirmishers, guide right) all the  corporals, except the corporal of the first squad, give the command, by  the left flank, the corporal of the first squad gives the command, as  skirmishers.    At the command march, all squads, except the first squad, move to the  left, and when they have their proper intervals they are deployed to the  right (left) and on the line of the base squad by the corporals giving  the commands: As skirmishers, 2. MARCH. The corporal of the first squad  deploys his squad as soon as he has sufficient room (interval).    That's all there is to the first movement with some slight  modifications.    Of course if the command had been as skirmishers, guide left, the base  squad would have been the left or fourteenth Squad instead of the first  squad, for when we speak of the right or left of a company, in the  deployments, the company being in line, we mean the right or left squads  of the company.    Another modification: Suppose the command had been as skirmishers, guide  center. In that case the base squad would be the center or seventh  squad. The base (seventh) squad deploys without moving to the right or  left. There is only one thing for the first six squads to do and that is  to move to the right. There is only one thing for the last seven squads  to do and that to move to the left.    We have considered the company so far to be at a halt; suppose that it  had been moving forward. The corporal of the base squad deploys his  squad as soon as he has sufficient interval, and then continues straight  to the front until the command: 1. Company, 2. HALT, is given by the  captain. The other corporals move their squads to the left front (or  right front), by commanding their squads, Follow me. They conduct their  squads on the shortest and easiest route to their places in the line and  then deploy their squads as they arrive in the general line.    [Illustration]    The corporals should remember that they are not to step out from their  squads to conduct them to their proper places until the captain has  given the command march.    The corporals often fail to take sufficient intervals thus causing a  jam.    The company being at a halt, the corporals should remember to give by  the right or left flank instead of right or left face.        SECOND CASE      Now suppose the company is in column of squads at a halt. It is desired  to form a skirmish line to the front: 1. As skirmishers, guide right  (left), 2. MARCH.    At the command march, the corporal of the first, or leading squad,  deploys his squad without advancing. All of the other corporals move to  the left front and deploy their squads on the line formed by the first  squad. At the preparatory command the corporals command, follow me, and  at the command MARCH, they step in front of their squads and conduct  them to their places.    Had the command been as skirmishers, guide left, of course all except  the leading squad would have moved to the right. For when the company is  in column of squads, as skirmishers, guide right means that the first or  leading squad is to be the right of the skirmish line. If left, instead  of right is given that simply means that the leading or base squad is to  be the left of the skirmish line.    Now we come to the last variation. It is difficult for the new man. The  command as skirmishers, guide center, the company being in column of  squads, simply means that the center squad is to be the base squad. All  other squads are to regulate their movements on the base squad as in all  other cases.    This is a peculiar case and for it the authorities have adopted a rule  of thumb. All squads in front of the base squad go to the right, those  in rear to the left. That's all there is to it. But that must be  remembered. Corporals will conduct their squads to their proper places  by the shortest and easiest routes.    We will use a platoon of four squads to illustrate the idea.    [Illustration]    Note that the leading corporal turns his squad well to the right rear  and then to the left.    We have assumed the company to be at a halt; suppose it is moving  forward. In that case the base squad simply continues moving forward  after it has deployed until the captain gives the command halt. The  other corporals conduct their squads by the shortest routes to their  proper places and deploy them on the general line.    [Illustration]    When the company, while moving, is deployed, it is a common error for  squads in rear of the base squad to take long and fast steps and come up  on the line of the base squad. This should not be done unless the  command double time is given. In which case all the squads take up the  double time, except the base squad.      Extended Order    RULES FOR DEPLOYMENTS    The command guide right (left or center) indicates the base squad for  the deployment; if in line it designates the actual right (left or  center) squad; if in column the command guide right (left) designates  the leading squad, and the command guide center designates the center  squad. After the deployment is completed, the guide is always center  without command, unless otherwise ordered.    At the preparatory command for forming skirmish line, from either column  of squads or line, each squad leader (except the leader of the base  squad, when his squad does not advance) cautions his squad, follow me or  by the right (left) flank, as the case may be; at the command march, he  steps in front of his squad and leads it to its place in line.    Having given the command for forming skirmish line, the captain, if  necessary, indicates to the corporal of the base squad the point on  which the squad is to march; the corporal habitually looks to the  captain for such directions.    The base squad is deployed as soon as it has sufficient interval. The  other squads are deployed as they arrive on the general line; each  corporal halts in his place in line and commands or signals, as  skirmishers march; the squad deploys and halts abreast of him.    If tactical considerations demand it, the squad is deployed before  arriving on the line.    Deployed lines preserve a general alignment toward the guide. Within  their respective fronts, individuals or units march so as best to secure  or to facilitate the advance but the general and orderly progress of  the whole is paramount.    On"]]]
