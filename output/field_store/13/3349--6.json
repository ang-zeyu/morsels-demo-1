When we read in the Laws of Manu[29] of  officers appointed to rule over ten, twenty, a hundred, or a thousand of  these villages, that means no more than that they were responsible for  the collection of taxes, and generally for the good behavior of these  villages. And when, in later times, we hear of circles of eighty-four  villages, the so-called Chourasees (_K_atura_s_iti[30]), and of three  hundred and sixty villages, this too seems to refer to fiscal  arrangements only. To the ordinary Hindu, I mean to ninety-nine in every  hundred, the village was his world, and the sphere of public opinion,  with its beneficial influences on individuals, seldom extended beyond  the horizon of his village.[31]    Colonel Sleeman was one of the first who called attention to the  existence of these village-communities in India, and their importance  in the social fabric of the whole country both in ancient and in  modern times; and though they have since become far better known and  celebrated through the writings of Sir Henry Maine, it is still both  interesting and instructive to read Colonel Sleeman's account. He  writes as a mere observer, and uninfluenced as yet by any theories on  the development of early social and political life among the Aryan  nations in general.    I do not mean to say that Colonel Sleeman was the first who pointed  out the palpable fact that the whole of India is parcelled out into  estates of villages. Even so early an observer as Megasthenes[32]  seems to have been struck by the same fact when he says that \"in India  the husbandmen with their wives and children live in the country, and  entirely avoid going into town.\" What Colonel Sleeman was the first to  point out was that all the native virtues of the Hindus are  intimately connected with their village-life.    That village-life, however, is naturally the least known to English  officials, nay, the very presence of an English official is often said to  be sufficient to drive away those native virtues which distinguish both  the private life and the public administration of justice and equity in an  Indian village.[33] Take a man out of his village-community, and you  remove him from all the restraints of society. He is out of his element,  and, under temptation, is more likely to go wrong than to remain true to  the traditions of his home-life. Even between village and village the  usual restraints of public morality are not always recognized. What would  be called theft or robbery at home is called a successful raid or conquest  if directed against distant villages; and what would be falsehood or  trickery in private life is honored by the name of policy and diplomacy if  successful against strangers. On the other hand, the rules of hospitality  applied only to people of other villages, and a man of the same village  could never claim the right of an _Atithi_, or guest.[34]    Let us hear now what Colonel Sleeman tells us about the moral  character of the members of these village-communities,[35] and let us  not forget that the Commissioner for the suppression of Thuggee had  ample opportunities of seeing the dark as well as the bright side of  the Indian character.    He assures us that falsehood or lying between members of the same  village is almost unknown. Speaking of some of the most savage tribes,  the Gonds, for instance, he maintains that nothing would induce them  to tell a lie, though they would think nothing of lifting a herd of  cattle from a neighboring plain.    Of these men it might perhaps be said that they have not yet learned  the value of a lie; yet even such blissful ignorance ought to count in  a nation's character. But I am not pleading here for Gonds, or Bhils,  or Santhals, and other non-Aryan tribes. I am speaking of the Aryan  and more or less civilized inhabitants of India. Now among them, where  rights, duties, and interests begin to clash in one and the same  village, public opinion, in its limited sphere, seems strong enough  to deter even an evil-disposed person from telling a falsehood. The  fear of the gods also has not yet lost its power.[36] In most villages  there is a sacred tree, a pipal-tree (Ficus Indica), and the gods are  supposed to delight to sit among its leaves, and listen to the music  of their rustling. The deponent takes one of these leaves in his hand,  and invokes the god, who sits above him, to crush him, or those dear  to him, as he crushes the leaf in his hand, if he speaks anything but  the truth. He then plucks and crushes the leaf, and states what he has  to say.    The pipal-tree is generally supposed to be occupied by one of the  Hindu deities, while the large cotton-tree, particularly among the  wilder tribes, is supposed to be the abode of local gods, all the more  terrible because entrusted with the police of a small settlement only.  In their punchayets, Sleeman tells us, men adhere habitually and  religiously to the truth, and \"I have had before me hundreds of  cases,\" he says, \"in which a man's property, liberty, and life has  depended upon his telling a lie, and he has refused to tell it.\"    Could many an English judge say the same?    In their own tribunals under the pipal-tree or cotton-tree,  imagination commonly did what the deities, who were supposed to  preside, had the credit of doing. If the deponent told a lie, he  believed that the god who sat on his sylvan throne above him, and  searched the heart of man, must know it; and from that moment he knew  no rest, he was always in dread of his vengeance. If any accident  happened to him, or to those dear to him, it was attributed to this  offended deity; and if no accident happened, some evil was brought  about by his own disordered imagination.[37] It was an excellent  superstition, inculcated in the ancient law-books, that the ancestors  watched the answer of a witness, because, according as it was true or  false, they themselves would go to heaven or to hell.[38]    Allow me to read you the abstract of a conversation between an English  official and a native law-officer as reported by Colonel Sleeman. The  native lawyer was asked what he thought would be the effect of an act  to dispense with oaths on the Koran and Ganges-water, and to  substitute a solemn declaration made in the name of God, and under the  same penal liabilities as if the Koran or Ganges-water had been in the  deponent's hand.    \"I have practiced in the courts,\" the native said, \"for thirty years,  and during that time I have found only three kinds of witnesses--two  of whom would, by such an act, be left precisely where they were,  while the third would be released by it from a very salutary check.\"    \"And, pray, what are the three classes into which you divide the  witnesses in our courts?\"    \"First, Sir, are those who will always tell the truth, whether they  are required to state what they know in the form of an oath or not.\"    \"Do you think this a large class?\"    \"Yes, I think it is; and I have found among them many whom nothing on  earth could make to swerve from the truth. Do what you please, you  could never frighten or bribe them into a deliberate falsehood.    \"The second are those who will not hesitate to tell a lie when they  have a motive for it, and are not restrained by an oath. In taking an  oath, they are afraid of two things, the anger of God and the odium of  men.    \"Only three days ago,\" he continued, \"I required a power of attorney  from a lady of rank, to enable me to act for her in a case pending  before the court in this town. It was given to me by her brother, and  two witnesses came to declare that she had given it. 'Now,' said I,  'this lady is known to live under the curtain, and you will be asked  by the judge whether you saw her give this paper: what will you say?'  They both replied: 'If the judge asks us the question without an oath,  we will say \"_Yes_;\" it will save much trouble, and we know that she  _did_ give the paper, though we did not really _see_ her give it; but  if he puts the Koran into our hands, we must say \"_No_,\" for we should  otherwise be pointed at by all the town as perjured wretches--our  enemies would soon tell everybody that we had taken a false oath.'    \"Now,\" the native lawyer went on, \"the form of an oath is a great  check on this sort of persons.    \"The third class consists of men who will tell lies whenever they have  a sufficient motive, whether they have the Koran or Ganges-water in  their hand or not. Nothing will ever prevent their doing so; and the  declaration which you propose would be just as well as any other for  them.\"    \"Which class do you consider the most numerous of the three?\"    \"I consider the second the most numerous, and wish the oath to be  retained for them.\"    \"That is, of all the men you see examined in our courts, you think the  most come under the class of those who will, under the influence of  strong motives, tell lies, if they have not the Koran or Ganges-water  in their hands?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But do not a great many of those whom you consider to be included  among the second class come from the village-communities--the  peasantry of the country?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And do you not think that the greatest part of those men who will  tell lies in the court, under the influence of strong motives, unless  they have the Koran or Ganges-water in their hands, would refuse to  tell lies, if questioned before the people of their villages, among  the circle in which they live?\"    \"Of course I do; three-fourths of those who do not scruple to lie in  the courts, would be ashamed to lie before their neighbors, or the  elders of their village.\"    \"You think that the people of the village-communities are more ashamed  to tell lies before their neighbors than the people of towns?\"    \"Much more--there is no comparison.\"    \"And the people of towns and cities bear in India but a small  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20848"],[0,"An Elementary Study of Chemistry (#11)"],[1,"water, it is       evident that if the natural water contains some substance which       is volatile its vapor will pass over and be condensed with the       steam, so that the distillate will not be pure water. Even such       mixtures, however, may generally be separated by repeated       distillation. Thus, if a mixture of water (boiling point 100 deg.)       and alcohol (boiling point 78 deg.) is distilled, the alcohol,       having the lower boiling point, tends to distill first,       followed by the water. The separation of the two is not       perfect, however, but may be made nearly so by repeated       distillations. The process of separating a mixture of volatile       substances by distillation is known as _fractional       distillation_.    2. _Filtration._ The process of distillation practically removes all  nonvolatile foreign matter, mineral as well as organic. In purifying  water for drinking purposes, however, it is only necessary to eliminate  the latter or to render it harmless. This is ordinarily done either by  filtration or boiling. In filtration the water is passed through some  medium which will retain the organic matter. Ordinary charcoal is a  porous substance and will condense within its pores the organic matter  in water if brought in contact with it. It is therefore well adapted to  the construction of filters. Such filters to be effective must be kept  clean, since it is evident that the charcoal is useless after its pores  are filled. A more effective type of filter is the Chamberlain-Pasteur  filter. In this the water is forced through a porous cylindrical cup,  the pores being so minute as to strain out the organic matter.         ~City filtration beds.~ For purifying the water supply of cities,       large filtration beds are prepared from sand and gravel, and       the water is allowed to filter through these. Some of the       impurities are strained out by the filter, while others are       decomposed by the action of certain kinds of bacteria present       in the sand. Fig. 25 shows a cross section of a portion of the       filter used in purifying the water supply of Philadelphia. The       water filters through the sand and gravel and passes into the       porous pipe A, from which it is pumped into the city mains.       The filters are covered to prevent the water from freezing in       cold weather.    [Illustration: Fig. 25]    3. _Boiling._ A simpler and equally efficient method for purifying water  for drinking purposes consists in boiling the water. It is the germs in  water that render it dangerous to health. These germs are living forms  of matter. If the water is boiled, the germs are killed and the water  rendered safe. While these germs are destroyed by heat, cold has little  effect upon them. Thus Dewar, in working with liquid hydrogen, exposed  some of these minute forms of life to the temperature of boiling  hydrogen (-252 deg.) without killing them.    ~Self-purification of water.~ It has long been known that water  contaminated with organic matter tends to purify itself when exposed to  the air. This is due to the fact that the water takes up a small amount  of oxygen from the air, which gradually oxidizes the organic matter  present in the water. While water is undoubtedly purified in this way,  the method cannot be relied upon to purify a contaminated water so as to  render it safe for drinking purposes.    ~Physical properties.~ Pure water is an odorless and tasteless liquid,  colorless in thin layers, but having a bluish tinge when observed  through a considerable thickness. It solidifies at 0 deg. and boils at 100 deg.  under the normal pressure of one atmosphere. If the pressure is  increased, the boiling point is raised. When water is cooled it steadily  contracts until the temperature of 4 deg. is reached: it then expands. Water  is remarkable for its ability to dissolve other substances, and is the  best solvent known. Solutions of solids in water are more frequently  employed in chemical work than are the solid substances, for chemical  action between substances goes on more readily when they are in solution  than it does when they are in the solid state.    ~Chemical properties.~ Water is a very stable substance, or, in other  words, it does not undergo decomposition readily. To decompose it into  its elements by heat alone requires a very high temperature; at 2500 deg.,  for example, only about 5% of the entire amount is decomposed. Though  very stable towards heat, water can be decomposed in other ways, as by  the action of the electrical current or by certain metals.         ~Heat of formation and heat of decomposition are equal.~ The fact       that a very high temperature is necessary to decompose water       into hydrogen and oxygen is in accord with the fact that a       great deal of heat is evolved by the union of hydrogen and       oxygen; for it has been proved that the heat necessary to       decompose a compound into its elements (heat of decomposition)       is equal to the heat evolved in the formation of a compound       from its elements (heat of formation).    ~Water of crystallization.~ When a solid is dissolved in water and the  resulting solution is allowed to evaporate, the solid separates out,  often in the form of crystals. It has been found that the crystals of  many compounds, although perfectly dry, give up a definite amount of  water when heated, the substance at the same time losing its crystalline  form. Such water is called _water of crystallization_. This varies in  amount with different compounds, but is perfectly definite for the same  compound. Thus, if a perfectly dry crystal of copper sulphate is  strongly heated in a tube, water is evolved and condenses on the sides  of the tube, the crystal crumbling to a light powder. The weight of the  water evolved is always equal to exactly 36.07% of the weight of copper  sulphate crystals heated. The water must therefore be in chemical  combination with the substance composing the crystal; for if simply  mixed with it or adhering to it, not only would the substance appear  moist but the amount present would undoubtedly vary. The combination,  however, must be a very weak one, since the water is often expelled by  even a gentle heat. Indeed, in some cases the water is given up on  simple exposure to air. Such compounds are said to be _efflorescent_.  Thus a crystal of sodium sulphate (Glauber's salt) on exposure to air  crumbles to a fine powder, owing to the escape of its water of  crystallization. Other substances have just the opposite property: they  absorb moisture when exposed to the air. For example, if a bit of dry  calcium chloride is placed in moist air, in the course of a few hours it  will have absorbed sufficient moisture to dissolve it. Such substances  are said to be _deliquescent_. A deliquescent body serves as a good  drying or _desiccating_ agent. We have already employed calcium chloride  as an agent for absorbing the moisture from hydrogen. Many substances,  as for example quartz, form crystals which contain no water of  crystallization.         ~Mechanically inclosed water.~ Water of crystallization must be       carefully distinguished from water which is mechanically       inclosed in a crystal and which can be removed by powdering the       crystal and drying. Thus, when crystals of common salt are       heated, the water inclosed in the crystal is changed into steam       and bursts the crystal with a crackling sound. Such crystals       are said to _decrepitate_. That this water is not combined is       proved by the fact that the amount present varies and that it       has all the properties of water.    ~Uses of water.~ The importance of water in its relation to life and  commerce is too well known to require comment. Its importance to the  chemist has also been pointed out. It remains to call attention to the  fact that it is used as a standard in many physical measurements. Thus  0 deg. and 100 deg. on the centigrade scale are respectively the freezing and  the boiling points of water under normal pressure. The weight of 1 cc.  of water at its point of greatest density is the unit of weight in the  metric system, namely, the gram. It is also taken as the unit for the  determination of the density of liquids and solids as well as for the  measurement of amounts of heat.      HYDROGEN DIOXIDE    ~Composition.~ As has been shown, 1 part by weight of hydrogen combines  with 7.94 parts by weight of oxygen to form water. It is possible,  however, to obtain a second compound of hydrogen and oxygen differing  from water in composition in that 1 part by weight of hydrogen is  combined with 2 x 7.94, or 15.88 parts, of oxygen. This compound is  called _hydrogen dioxide_ or _hydrogen peroxide_, the prefixes _di-_ and  _per-_ signifying that it contains more oxygen than hydrogen oxide,  which is the chemical name for water.    ~Preparation.~ Hydrogen dioxide cannot be prepared cheaply by the direct  union of hydrogen and oxygen, and indirect methods must therefore be  used. It is commonly prepared by the action of a solution of sulphuric  acid on barium dioxide. The change which takes place may be indicated as  follows:    sulphuric acid +  barium dioxide =  barium sulphate + hydrogen dioxide  --------------    --------------    ---------------   ----------------    hydrogen          barium           barium             hydrogen    sulphur           oxygen           sulphur            oxygen    oxygen                             oxygen    In other words, the barium and hydrogen in the two compounds exchange  places. By this method a dilute solution of the dioxide in water is  obtained. It is possible to separate the dioxide from the water by  fractional distillation. This is attended with great difficulties,  however, since the pure dioxide is explosive. The distillation is  carried on under diminished pressure so as to lower the boiling points"]]]
