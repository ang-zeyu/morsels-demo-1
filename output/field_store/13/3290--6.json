Borrow's frequent meetings with Petulengro[25] are no  doubt many of them mythical. He was an imaginative writer, and Dr.  Knapp's worst banality is to suggest that he 'invented nothing.' But  Petulengro was a very real person, who lived the usual roving gypsy  life. There is no reason to assume otherwise than that Borrow did  actually meet him at Norman Cross when he was eight years old, and  Ambrose a year younger, and not thirteen as Borrow states. In the  original manuscript of _Lavengro_ in my possession, as in the copy of it  in Mrs. Borrow's handwriting that came into the possession of Dr. Knapp,  'Ambrose' is given instead of 'Jasper,' and the name was altered as an  afterthought. It is of course possible that Borrow did not actually meet  Jasper until his arrival in Norwich, for in the first half of the  nineteenth century various gypsy families were in the habit of  assembling their carts and staking their tents on the heights above  Norwich, known as Mousehold Heath, that glorious tract of country that  has been rendered memorable in history by the tragic life of Kett the  tanner, and has been immortalised in painting by Turner and Crome. Here  were assembled the Smiths and Hernes and Boswells, names familiar to  every student of gypsy lore. Jasper Petulengro, as Borrow calls him, or  Ambrose Smith, to give him his real name, was the son of F[=a]den Smith,  and his name of Ambrose was derived from his uncle, Ambrose Smith, who  was transported for stealing harness. Ambrose was twice married, and it  was his second wife, Sanspirella Herne, who comes into the Borrow story.  He had families by both his wives. Ambrose had an extraordinary varied  career. It will be remembered by readers of the _Zincali_ that when he  visited Borrow at Oulton in 1842 he complained that 'There is no living  for the poor people, brother, the chokengres (police) pursue us from  place to place, and the gorgios are become either so poor or miserly  that they grudge our cattle a bite of grass by the wayside, and  ourselves a yard of ground to light a fire upon.' After a time Ambrose  left the eastern counties and crossed to Ireland. In 1868 he went to  Scotland, and there seems to have revived his fortunes. In 1878 he and  his family were encamped at Knockenhair Park, about a mile from Dunbar.  Here Queen Victoria, who was staying at Broxmouth Park near by with the  Dowager Duchess of Roxburghe, became interested in the gypsies, and paid  them a visit.[26] This was in the summer of 1878. Ambrose was then a  very old man. He died in the following October. His wife, Sanspi or  Sanspirella, received a message of sympathy from the Queen. Very shortly  after Ambrose's death, however, most of the family went off to America,  where doubtless they are now scattered, many of them, it may be, leading  successful lives, utterly oblivious of the association of one of their  ancestors with Borrow and his great book. Ambrose Smith was buried in  Dunbar cemetery, the Christian service being read over his grave, and  his friends erected a stone to him which bears the following  inscription, the hymn not being very accurately rendered:                In Memory of      AMBROSE SMITH, who died 22nd      October 1878, aged 74 years.                  Also             THOMAS, his son,      who died 28th May 1879, aged 48 years.        'Nearer my Father's House,      Where the many mansions be;      Nearer the Great White Throne,      Nearer the Jasper Sea.        'Nearer the bound of life      Where we lay our burdens down;      Nearer leaving the Cross,      Nearer gaining the Crown.        'Feel thee near me when my feet      Are slipping over the brink;      For it may be I'm nearer home,      Nearer now than I think.'[27]    In December 1912 a London newspaper contained an account of a gypsy  meeting at which Jasper Petulengro was present. Not only was this  obviously impossible, but no relative of Ambrose Smith is apparently  alive in England who could by any chance have justified the imposition.    I have said that it is probable that Borrow did not meet Jasper or  Ambrose until later days in Norwich. I assume this as possible because  Borrow misstates the age of his boy friend in _Lavengro_. Ambrose was  actually a year younger than Borrow, whereas when George was eight years  of age he represents Ambrose as 'a lad of some twelve or thirteen  years,' and he keeps up this illusion on more than one later occasion.  However, we may take it as almost certain that Borrow received his first  impression of the gypsies in these early days at Norman Cross.    C. EDINBURGH AND DAVID HAGGART.--Three years separated the sojourn of  the Borrow family at Norman Cross from their sojourn in Edinburgh--three  years of continuous wandering. The West Norfolk Militia were watching  the French prisoners at Norman Cross for fifteen months. After that we  have glimpses of them at Colchester, at East Dereham again, at Harwich,  at Leicester, at Huddersfield, concerning which place Borrow  incidentally in _Wild Wales_ writes of having been at school, in  Sheffield, in Berwick-on-Tweed, and finally the family are in Edinburgh,  where they arrive on 6th April 1813. We have already referred to  Borrow's presence at the High School of Edinburgh, the school sanctified  by association with Walter Scott and so many of his illustrious  fellow-countrymen. He and his brother were at the High School for a  single session, that is, for the winter session of 1813-14, although  with the licence of a maker of fiction he claimed, in _Lavengro_, to  have been there for two years. But it is not in this brief period of  schooling of a boy of ten that we find the strongest influence that  Edinburgh gave to Borrow. Rather may we seek it in the acquaintanceship  with the once too notorious David Haggart. Seven years later than this  all the peoples of the three kingdoms were discussing David Haggart, the  Scots Jack Sheppard, the clever young prison-breaker, who was hanged at  Edinburgh in 1821 for killing his jailer in Dumfries prison. How much  David Haggart filled the imagination of every one who could read in the  early years of last century is demonstrated by a reference to the  Library Catalogue of the British Museum, where we find pamphlet after  pamphlet, broadsheet after broadsheet, treating of the adventures,  trial, and execution of this youthful jailbird. Even George Combe, the  phrenologist, most famous in his day, sat in judgment upon the young man  while he was in prison, and published a pamphlet which made a great  impression upon prison reformers. Combe submitted his observations to  Haggart in jail, and told the prisoner indeed that he had a greater  development of the organs of benevolence and justice than he had  anticipated. There cannot be a doubt but that Combe started in a  measure, through his treatment of this case, the theory that many of our  methods of punishment led to the making of habitual criminals.[28] But  by far the most valuable publication with regard to Haggart is one that  Borrow must have read in his youth. This was a life of Haggart written  by himself,[29] a little book that had a wide circulation, and  containing a preface by George Robertson, Writer to the Signet, dated  Edinburgh, 20th July 1821. Mr. Robertson tells us that a portion of the  story was written by Haggart, and the remainder taken down from his  dictation. The profits of this book, Haggart arranged, were to go in  part to the school of the jail in which he was confined, and part to be  devoted to the welfare of his younger brothers and sister. From this  little biography we learn that Haggart was born in Golden Acre, near  Canon-Mills, in the county of Edinburgh in 1801, his father, John  Haggart, being a gamekeeper, and in later years a dog-trainer. The boy  was at school under Mr. Robin Gibson at Canon-Mills for two years. He  left school at ten years of age, and from that time until his execution  seems to have had a continuous career of thieving. He tells us that  before he was eleven years old he had stolen a bantam cock from a woman  belonging to the New Town of Edinburgh. He went with another boy to  Currie, six miles from Edinburgh, and there stole a pony, but this was  afterwards returned. When but twelve years of age he attended Leith  races, and it was here that he enlisted in the Norfolk Militia, then  stationed in Edinburgh Castle. This may very well have brought him into  contact with Borrow in the way described in _Lavengro_. He was only,  however, in the regiment for a year, for when it was sent back to  England the Colonel in command of it obtained young Haggart's discharge.  These dates coincide with Borrow's presence in Edinburgh. Haggart's  history for the next five or six years was in truth merely that of a  wandering pickpocket, sometimes in Scotland, sometimes in England, and  finally he became a notorious burglar. Incidentally he refers to a girl  with whom he was in love. Her name was Mary Hill She belonged to  Ecclefechan, which Haggart more than once visited. He must therefore  have known Carlyle, who had not then left his native village. In 1820 we  find him in Edinburgh, carrying on the same sort of depredations both  there and at Leith--now he steals a silk plaid, now a greatcoat, and now  a silver teapot. These thefts, of course, landed him in jail, out of  which he breaks rather dramatically, fleeing with a companion to Kelso.  He had, indeed, more than one experience of jail. Finally, we find him  in the prison of Dumfries destined to stand his trial for 'one act of  house-breaking, eleven cases of theft, and one of prison-breaking.'  While in prison at Dumfries he planned another escape, and in the  attempt to hit a jailer named Morrin on the head with a stone he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1980"],[0,"Stories (#11)"],[1,"the resting-places of former agents of Messrs. Flint  Brothers.    As quick interment was necessary in such a climate, even on that very  day, I went to call Jackson in order that he might perform the duty  that was his--that of reading the burial service over the dead, and of  sealing up the desk and effects of Mr. Bransome. But Jackson was not in  the factory. I guessed, however, where he was; and sure enough I found  him in his accustomed haunt at the end of the Point. The moment he saw  me he tried to hide himself among the brushwood, but I was too quick for  him, and spied him as he crouched behind a dwarf palm.    \"I know, I know,\" he cried, as I ran up to him; \"I saw you come along  the beach. Bury them, bury them out of sight.\"    \"Come, Mr. Jackson,\" I replied, \"it isn't fair to put all the trouble on  to me. I am sure I have had enough of the weariness and anxiety of this  sad business. You must take your share of it. I want you to read the  service for the dead over them.\"    \"No, no,\" he almost shrieked; \"bury them quick; never mind me. Put them  out of sight.\"    \"I will not,\" I said, resolutely. \"For your own sake you must, at any  rate, view the bodies.\"    \"They have not been murdered?\" He replied. But the startled look with  which I received the suggestion his words implied seemed to make him  recollect himself, for he rose and took my arm without saying more. As  he did so, I felt for the first time a sort of repugnance toward him.  Up to that moment my feeling had been one of pity and anxiety on his  account, but now I loathed him. This he seemed instinctively to feel,  and he clung closely to me.    Once at the factory I determined that there should be no more delay on  his part, and I took him to the door of the room where the bodies had  been laid, but at it he made a sudden halt and would not enter. Covering  his face with his hands, he trembled violently as I pushed the door open  and advanced to the bedside. The room, hushed and in semi-darkness; the  white sheet, whose surface showed too plainly the forms beneath it;  and the scared, terrified face of the man who, with brain afire,  stood watching, with staring eyes, the bed, made a scene I have never  forgotten.    Slowly I turned down the upper part of the sheet, and Jackson, as if  fascinated by the act, advanced a step or two into the room, but with  face averted. Gradually he turned it toward the bodies, and for a moment  his gaze rested upon them. The next instant he staggered forward, looked  at the woman's face, panted for breath once or twice, and then, with  uplifted hands and a wild cry of \"Lucy!\" fell his length upon the floor.  When I stooped over him he was in convulsions, and dark matter was  oozing out of his mouth. The climax had come. I shouted for the  servants, and they carried him to his own room, and placed him on his  own bed.    How I got through that day I hardly know. Alone I buried Bransome  and his wife, and alone I returned from the hurried task to watch by  Jackson's bedside. None of the natives would stay near him. For two days  he lay unconscious. At the end of that time he seemed to have some idea  of the outside world, for his eyes met mine with intelligence in their  look, and on bending over him I heard him whisper, \"Forgive me!\" Then  he relapsed into unconsciousness again. Through the long hours his eyes  remained ever open and restless; he could not eat, nor did he sleep, and  I was afraid he would pass away through weakness without a sign,  being an old man. On the third day he became delirious, and commenced  chattering and talking to himself, and imagining that all kinds of  horrid shapes and creatures were around and near him. I had to watch him  narrowly in order to prevent him stealing out of his bed, which he  was ready to do at any moment to avoid the tortures which he fearfully  imagined awaited him. By these signs I knew that he was in the middle  of an attack of delirium tremens, and I tried to quiet him by means of  laudanum, but it had no effect upon him. I got him, however, to swallow  a little soup, which sustained him. My own boy was the only negro I had  been able to induce to stay in the room, and he would only remain in it  while I was there.    I had sent a messenger to the nearest station, where I remembered there  was a Portuguese doctor; but he had not returned by the evening of the  fourth day. That night, worn out with watching, I had dozed off to sleep  on a chair placed by the sick man's bed, when all at once I was awakened  by a loud report, and I jumped up to find the room filled with smoke.  As it cleared away I saw that Jackson was standing in the middle of  the room with a revolver in his hand. As I confronted him he laughed a  devilish laugh and cocked the weapon, crying as he did so, \"It was you  who tempted me with your smooth face and unsuspicious way, and you  shall die, though I suffer doubly in hell for it. Hist!\" and he stopped  suddenly and listened. \"Don't you hear the breakers? Hark, how they  roar! They say they are ready, always ready,\" and staring in front of  him, he advanced, as if following the sign of an invisible hand, to the  door, unconsciously placing, to my infinite relief, the revolver on the  top of a chest of drawers as he passed by it. I did not dare to move,  and he opened the door and walked into the front room. Then I followed  him. For a little he remained in the room, glaring vacantly about him,  and muttering to himself; but seeing the outer door open he made a rush  toward it, and disappeared into the darkness of the night. Calling to  the boy, I ran after him, and easily came up to him, when he turned, and  picking up a heavier stone than I thought he could have lifted, threw it  at me. I dodged it and closed with him. Once in my arms I found I could  hold him, and my servant and I carried him back into the factory. We  placed him on the floor of the dining-room, and he was too exhausted  to move for a while. By degrees, however, he recovered sufficiently to  stand; and as soon as he could do so by himself, with devilish cunning  he made for the lamp, which he struck, quick as lightning, with a stick  that had been lying on the table. In an instant the great round globe  fell to pieces, but luckily the chimney was not broken, and the lamp  remained alight, and before he could strike another blow at it I had  grappled with him again. This time he struggled violently for a few  moments, and seemed to think that he was dealing with Bransome, for he  shrieked, \"What! have you come back from the sea? You are wet! you are  wet!\" and shuddering, he tried to free himself from my hold; and I, not  liking to hurt him, let him go, taking care to keep myself between him  and the lamp.    \"Back from me, you villain of hell!\" he cried, as soon as he was free.  \"What have you done with her? what have you done with her?\" And then,  in a tone of weird and pathetic sorrow, \"Where is my little one that I  loved? I have sought her many a year; oh, why did she forsake me? Aha,  Sooka! we were right to send him to the hell whence he came--the lying,  false-hearted scoundrel, to steal away my white dove!\"    After which he drew from his finger a solid gold ring which he always  wore, and threw it from him, saying, with a wild laugh, \"There! that's  for any one that likes it; I'm a dead man.\" He then staggered toward his  own room, and I, remembering the loaded revolver which still lay on  the chest of drawers, tried to intercept him. In his rage, for I verily  believe that he also remembered that the weapon was there, he spat in my  face, and struck me with all his force between the eyes; but I stuck to  him, and with the help of the boy, who had been all this time in hiding,  but who came forward at my call, I laid him for the last time upon his  bed. There he lay exhausted for the remainder of the night; but there  was no rest for me; I felt that I had to watch him now for my own  safety.    Toward morning, however, his breathing became, all at once, very heavy  and slow, and I bent over him in alarm. As I did so, I heard him  sigh faintly, \"Lucy!\" and at that moment the native boy softly placed  something upon the bed. I took it up. It was the ring the sick man had  thrown away in the night, and as I looked at it I saw \"James, from Lucy\"  engraved on its inside surface, and I knew that the dead woman was his  wife.    As the first faint streaks of dawn stole into the room, the  slow-drawn breathing of the dying man ceased. I listened--it came  again--once--twice--and then all was silence. He was dead, and I  realised in the sudden stillness that had come upon the room that I was  alone. Yet he had passed away so quietly after his fitful fever that I  could not bring myself to believe that he was really gone, and I stood  looking at the body, fearing to convince myself of the truth by touching  it.    So entranced was I by that feeling of awe which comes to almost every  one in the presence of death, that I did not hear the shouting of the  hammock-boy outside, or the footsteps of a white man coming into  the room; and not until he touched me on the shoulder did I turn and  recognise the sallow face of the Portuguese doctor whom I had sent for,  and who had thus arrived too late. However, he served to help me to bury  the mortal part of Jackson in the little graveyard beside the body of  his wife and that of the man who had come between them when alive. And  such was without doubt the fact; for when the doctor had gone, and I  was alone again, I collected and made an inventory of the dead men's  effects, and in Jackson's desk I found his diary, or, as he himself  would have called it, his log; and in that log was noted, on the very  day that Bransome had arrived on the Point, his suspicion of the man,  and later on his conviction that Bransome was indeed he who had injured  him.    Sooka was never found; but when the mail-steamer returned"]]]
