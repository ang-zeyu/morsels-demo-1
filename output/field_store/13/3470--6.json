This leaves the design raised with a smooth surface.    The brass can now be removed from the board, placed on the frame and  fastened with the ornamental tacks.    Turn the stool bottom side up and line the inside of the rails with  asbestos; then place the bricks on the inside of the stool. Both should  fit up tight to the brass when the bottom is in place.    [Illustration: Oak Stool with Brass Cover]    The stool is now ready for the finish, which can be of some stain to  match the other furniture in the room where it is to be used.          A PLATE RACK FOR THE DINING ROOM      This plate rack can be made of any kind of wood and finished to match  other pieces of furniture in the room, but as it is of mission design,  oak is the most suitable lumber, as it takes the mission stain so  nicely.    The material required is as follows:      4 posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 28 in., S-4-S.    1 top, 7/8 by 7-1/4 by 48 in., S-2-S.    2 plate rails, 7/8 by 6-1/4 by 32 in., S-2-S.    2 back boards, 7/8 by 7-1/4 by 25 in., S-2-S.    2 side boards, 7/8 by 5-1/4 by 25 in., S-2-S.    4 shelves, 7/8 by 6-1/2 by 8-1/4 in., S-2-S.    2 plate rests, 7/8 by 7/8 by 32 in., S-4-S.    [Illustration: Detail of Plate Rack]    This stock is specified to exact thickness, but some allowance is made  for trimming on the edges and ends.    Begin work by squaring up the posts to length and beveling the top ends,  then trim the back and side boards. These are nailed together, lapping  the back board over the side board. The posts are fastened with dowels  placed at equal distances apart. Hot glue is used in the joints.    [Illustration: Dining-Room Plate Rack]    The four shelves are now put in place. These are notched out to fit  around the posts and are nailed and glued.    While the glue is hardening on these, the plate rails can be cut. These  have 7/8-in grooves near the front edge to receive the lower edge of the  plates when resting against the two strips placed 5 in. above the plate  rails and far enough back to prevent the plates from falling forward.    The rails are fastened to the two sides with dowels, three at each end  being sufficient. The two strips fit in mortises cut in the side pieces.  The top is then put on. This fits around the posts and rests on the  sides. Hooks on which to hang cups are placed under the rails. All parts  are thoroughly sandpapered before the stain is applied.          A MISSION SIDEBOARD      [Illustration: Sideboard for the Dining-Room Set]    The sideboard is a piece designed to go with the armchair and side chair  with similar paneling design. Like these chairs the sideboard should be  made of hard wood and should be similarly finished. The drawer pulls, if  not made of wood, should be of such metal and design as to harmonize  with the mission style. Wrought-iron effects in plain outlines are  appropriate.    Drawer sides, bottoms and backs may be made of some soft wood, such as  yellow poplar. The small top drawer may be lined with ooze leather for  holding silverware.    Obtain the following stock:       2 posts, 2 by 2 by 50 in., S-4-S.     2 posts, 2 by 2 by 39 in., S-4-S.     1 top, 1 by 23 by 58 in., S-2-S.     2 plate rails, 1/2 by 2 by 58 in., S-4-S.     1 plate rail, 1/2 by 1-1/2 by 58 in., S-4-S.     2 rails, 7/8 by 2 by 21 in., S-4-S.     2 rails, 7/8 by 2-1/2 by 21 in., S-4-S.     2 rails, 7/8 by 3 by 21 in., S-4-S.     4 slats, 3/8 by 1-1/2 by 10-1/2 in., S-4-S.     2 slats, 3/8 by 3-1/2 by 10-1/2 in., S-4-S.     2 panels, 3/8 by 18-3/4 by 10 in., S-2-S.     1 back rail, 7/8 by 2 by 54 in., S-4-S.     1 back rail, 7/8 by 3-1/8 by 54 in., S-4-S.     1 back rail, 7/8 by 3 by 54 in., S-4-S.     2 back stiles, 7/8 by 1-3/4 by 11 in., S-4-S.     2 back stiles, 7/8 by 2-1/2 by 11 in., S-4-S.     1 back panel, 3/8 by 10 by 24-1/2 in., S-2-S.     1 back panel, 3/8 by 11-1/2 by 53 in., S-2-S.     2 back panels, 3/8 by 11 by 11 in., S-2-S.     1 drawer front, 3/4 by 3 by 24-1/2 in., S-4-S.     2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 4 by 24-1/2 in., S-4-S.     2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 6 by 52-1/2 in., S-4-S.     2 drawer ends, 1/2 by 3 by 20 in., S-4-S, poplar.     4 drawer ends, 1/2 by 4 by 20 in., S-4-S, poplar.     4 drawer ends, 5/8 by 6 by 20 in., S-4-S, poplar.     3 drawer backs, 3/8 by 4 by 24 in., S-2-S, poplar.     2 drawer backs, 3/8 by 6 by 52 in., S-2-S, poplar.     3 drawer bottoms, 3/8 by 20 by 24 in., S-2-S, poplar.     2 drawer bottoms, 3/8 by 20 by 52 in., S-2-S, poplar.     2 drawer supports, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 24-1/2 in., S-4-S.     4 drawer supports, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 54 in., S-4-S.    10 drawer slides, 3/4 by 2 by 22 in., S-4-S.     2 middle verticals, 3/4 by 22 by 13 in., S-2-S.    Drawer guides can be made from scrap stock.    A detailed description is hardly necessary for such a piece of work as  this. Anyone capable of building it, will know the order of the  different operations that are required in its construction.    [Illustration: Detail of the Sideboard]    It may be said that the two back panels at either side of the small  drawers may be filled with beveled plate glass instead of wood if one so  choose.

But are you happy?\"    The Dragon smiled sweetly and nodded, then pointed to the stream.    That made the Toad madder than ever, for he thought it meant that the  Dragon was claiming the whole stream. So the Toad said: \"See, Dragon,  there is a wonderful food that you have never tasted, that is a poached  egg.\"    This he said with his heart full of guile, for he knew full well that  poached eggs are deadly poison to Dragons.    The Dragon looked puzzled, and the Toad said, \"Have you?\"    The Dragon shook his head. \"Well,\" said the Toad, \"it is the most  delicious thing in the woods; now you wait and see.\"    He went hoppity-hop, to a sand-bank where he had seen a Turtle lay its  eggs that morning. He dug out one. He rolled it upon a stone, and split  it open with the sharp spur on his heel. As soon as it was stiffened by  the sun heat, he said, \"Here now, Dragon, swallow it down, while I get  another for myself.\"    The poor innocent little Dragon did not know any better. He tried to  swallow the poached egg. The moment he did, it stuck in his throat, and  poisoned him. At once his toes sank into the ground. He turned green all  over, and his head was changed into a strange new flower. There it is to  this day, standing silently where it can hear the brook a-prattling. Its  body is green all over, and its head is yellow and its jaws are wide  open with a poached egg stuck in its throat. And that is how it all came  about. Some call it Toad Flax, and some call it Butter and Eggs, but we  who know how it happened call it the Dragon and the Poached Egg.    Poor dear little Yellow Dragon!      TALE 32    The Fairy Bird or the Humming-bird Moth    When I was a schoolboy, a number of my companions brought the news that  the strangest bird in the world had come that day to our garden and  hovered over the flowers. It was no bigger than a bumble-bee. \"No! It  was not a humming-bird,\" they said, \"it was smaller by far, much more  beautiful, and it came and went so fast that no one could see it go.\"    [Illustration: The Fairy Bird (1-1/2 life size)]    Every guess that I made seemed not to fit the wonderful bird, or help to  give it a name that would lead us to its history in the books. The  summer went by, several schoolmates saw the Wonderbird, and added  stories of its marvellous smallness and mysterious habits. Its body,  they said, was of green velvet with a satin-white throat; it had a  long beak--at least an inch long--a fan-tail of many feathers, two long  plumes from its head, \"the littlest feet you ever have seen,\" and large  lustrous eyes that seemed filled with human intelligence. \"It jest  looked right at you, and seemed like a fairy looking at you.\"    The wonder grew. I made a sketch embodying all the points that my  companions noted about the Fairy Bird. The first drawing shows what it  looked like, and also gives the exact size they said it was.    It seemed a cruel wrong that let so many of them see the thing that was  of chief interest to me, yet left me out. It clearly promised a real  fairy, an elfin bird, a wonderful messenger from the land I hungered to  believe in.    But at last my turn came. One afternoon two of the boys ran toward me,  shouting: \"Here it is, the little Fairy Bird, right in the garden over  the honeysuckle. C'mon, quick!\"    I rushed to the place, more excited than I can tell. Yes, there it was,  hovering over the open flowers--tiny, wonderful, humming as it swung on  misty wings. I made a quick sweep of my insect net and, marvellous to  relate, scooped up the Fairy Bird. I was trembling with excitement now,  not without a sense of wickedness that I should dare to net a  fairy--practically an angel. But I had done it, and I gloated over my  captive, in the meshes. Yes, the velvet body and snowy throat were  there, the fan-tail, the plumes and the big dark eyes, but the creature  was _not a bird_; it was an insect! Dimly now I remembered, and in a few  hours, learned, as I had feared, that I had not captured a young angel  or even a fairy--it was nothing but a Humming-bird Moth, a beautiful  insect--common in some regions, scarce in some, such as mine--but  perfectly well known to men of science and never afterward forgotten by  any of that eager schoolboy group.      TALE 33    Ribgrass or Whiteman's-Foot    If you live in the country or in a small town, you will not have to go  many steps, in summer time, before you find the little plant known as  Ribgrass, Plantain, or Whiteman's-foot. If you live in a big city, you  may find it in any grassy place, but will surely see it, as soon as you  reach the suburbs. It grows on the ground, wherever it can see the sun,  and is easily known by the strong ribs, each with a string in it when  you pull the leaf apart. The Indians call it Whiteman's-foot, not  because it is broad and flat, but because it came from Europe with the  white man; it springs up wherever he sets his foot, and it has spread  over all America. Gardeners think it a troublesome weed; but the birds  love its seed; canary birds delight in it; and each plant of the  Ribgrass may grow many thousands of seeds in a summer.    How many? Let us see! Take a seed-stalk of the Plantain and you will  find it thickly set with little cups, as in the drawing. Open one of  these cups, and you find in it five seeds. Count the cups; there are two  hundred on this stalk, each with about five seeds, that is, one thousand  seeds; but the plant has five or more seed-stalks, some have more (one  before me now has seventeen), but suppose it has only ten; then there  are 10,000 seeds each summer from one little plant. Each seed can grow  up into a new plant; and, if each plant were as far from the next as you  can step, the little ones in a row the following summer would reach for  nearly six miles; that is, from the City Hall to the end of Central  Park, New York.[B]    [Illustration: The Ribgrass]    [Illustration: Jack-in-the-Pulpit]    On the third year if all had the full number of seed, and all the seed  grew into plants, there would be enough to go more than twice round the  world. No wonder it has spread all over the country.      TALE 34    Jack-in-the-Pulpit    Once upon a time there was a missionary named the Rev. John T. Arum, who  set out to preach to the Indians. He had a good heart but a bitter,  biting tongue. He had no respect for the laws of the Indians, so they  killed him, and buried him in the woods. But out of his grave came a new  and wonderful plant, shaped like a pulpit, and right in the middle of  it, as usual, was the Reverend Jack hard at it, preaching away.    If you dig down under the pulpit you will find the preacher's body, or  his heart, in the form of a round root. Taste it and you will believe  that the preacher had a terribly biting tongue, but treat it properly,  that is boil it, and you will find out that after all he had a good  little heart inside. Even the Indians have discovered his good qualities  and have become very fond of him.      TALE 35    How the Indian Pipe Came    [Illustration: How the Indian Pipe Came]    In the last tale you learned the fate of the Rev. John T. Arum, and the  origin of Jack-in-the-Pulpit. But you must not suppose for a moment that  the Indians decided in a hurry to kill the missionary. No, they had too  much sense of fair play for that. They held a great many councils first  to find some way of curbing his tongue, and making him mind his own  business. In fact, they got into the habit of holding a council every  few minutes to discuss the question, no matter where they were or what  else they were doing. So that pretty nearly every part of the woods was  in time used for a council ring to discuss the fate of the Rev. John T.  Arum.    Of course, you know that no Indian can hold a council without smoking  the Peace Pipe, and when the council is over, he empties out the ashes  of the pipe. So that when all those councils were over, when the matter  was settled, when the missionary was buried, and when the warrior had  gone to the ghost land, there came solemnly poking its white bowl and  stem from under the leaves an Indian pipe, at the very spot where the  Councillors had emptied the ashes. It is a beautifully shaped pipe, with  a curved and feathered stem, but it has none of the bright colours of  the old Peace Pipe. It cannot have them for this is only a ghost Pipe to  show where the council used to be; and one pipe there is for each  council held on that spot, so you see how many, many councils the  Indians had, before they killed the troublesome preacher. And sometimes  you can find a pipe that has the bowl still filled with ghost tobacco or  even a little red ghost fire, showing that the warriors had to hurry  away before that council was finished. Whenever you find the ghost pipe  in the woods, you are sure to see close by either a log, a bank or a  rock on which the Councillors sat to talk it over.      TALE 36    The Cucumber Under the Brownie's Umbrella    The Indians had Brownies, only they called them Pukwudjies, and I am  going to tell you a story of an Indian Brownie.    [Illustration: The Cucumber Under the Brownie's Umbrella]    Whenever the Indians got together for a council, the Brownies did the  same thing, in the woods near by. It was a kind of Brownie Fair, and  some of the little people used to have stands and sell refreshments.  Berries were scarce in the springtime, but the Brownies were very fond  of cucumber. So there were always one or two Cucumber Brownies, who set  up their little umbrellas, and sold slices of Cucumber to the others.    When it was time to go home, or when the sun got so hot that the  cucumbers were likely to spoil, they would bury them in the ground, but  leave the umbrella to mark the place. And there they are yet; many a  time have I found the umbrella, and dug under it to find the cucumber.  It is delicious eating; everything that "]]]
