See Sec. 9, 1,2.      2. {The Weak Declension.}    Sec. 56.    The weak declension of adjectives agrees exactly with that of the nouns.             SING.            _Masc._           _Neut._    _Fem._      Nom.  blinde, _blind_   blinde     blinde    Acc.  blinden           blinde     blinden    Gen.  blinden           blinden    blinden    Dat.  blinden           blinden    blinden      Plural {blinden} for all cases and genders.      B. THE COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES.    Sec. 57.    The comparative was formed by means of the suffix {-er(e)} = OHG.  {-iro}, {-[o]ro}, and the superlative by means of the suffix {-est(e)} =  OHG. {-isto}, {-[o]sto}. On the loss of the medial or final {e} in such  forms as {tiurre}, _dearer_, {tiurste}; {minner}, {minre}, _less_,  {minnest}, {min(ne)ste}, see Sec. 9, 3. Most monosyllables have umlaut in  the comparative and superlative either exclusively or have mutated  beside unmutated forms. The cause of these double forms is in a great  measure due to the two OHG. double suffixes: comp. {-iro}, {-[o]ro} and  superl. {-isto}, {-[o]sto} having fallen together in {-er(e)} and  {-est(e)} in MHG., as {elter}, _older_, {ermer}, _poorer_, {j[u:]nger},  _younger_, {gr[oe][z]er}, _greater_, {h[oe]her}, _higher_, beside {alter},  {armer}, {junger}, {gr[o][z]er}, {h[o]her}; superl. {eltest}, {ermest},  {j[u:]ngest}, {gr[oe][z]est}, {h[oe]hest}, beside {altest}, {armest},  {jungest}, {gr[o][z]est}, {h[o]hest}. Adjectives which have umlaut in the  positive regularly preserve it in the comparative and superlative.    The comparative is declined weak, but the superlative is declined strong  and weak.      Sec. 58.    The following adjectives form their comparative and superlative from a  different root than the positive:--      guot, _good_,     be[zz]er, be[zz]est, beste (Sec. 23).    [u:]bel, _bad_,      wirser, wirsest, wir(se)ste.    l[u:]tzel, _little_, minner, minre (Sec. 9, 3), minnest, min(ne)ste.    michel, _great_,  m[e]rer, m[e]r(r)e, meiste.      Sec. 59.    The following adjectives are defective:--      [e]rer, [e]rre, [e:]rre, _former_,  [e]rest, [e]rste, _first_.    hinder, _hinder_,            hinderste, _hindmost_.    ober, _upper_,               oberste, _uppermost_.                                 le[zz]este, leste (Sec. 23), _last_.    vorder, _former_,            vorderste, _foremost_.      C. FORMATION OF ADVERBS FROM ADJECTIVES.    Sec. 60.    1. By adding {-e} (= OHG. {-o}) to the adjective when this does not  already end in {-e}, as {[e:]ben}, _even_, {h[o]ch}, _high_, {lanc}, _long_:  adv. {[e:]bene}, {h[o]he}, {lange}; {edele} (OHG. {edili}), _noble_, {[u:]bel}  (OHG. {ubil}), _evil_: adv. {edele} (OHG. {edilo}), {[u:]bele} (OHG.  {ubilo}).    2. Dissyllabic adjectives ending in {-e} and containing a mutated  stem-vowel change it to the corresponding unmutated vowel, when used as  adverbs, as {sch[oe]ne} (OHG. {sc[o]ni}), _beautiful_, {herte}, _hard_,  {senfte}, _soft_, {s[u:]e[z]e}, _sweet_, {sw[ae]re}, _heavy_: adv. {sch[o]ne},  {harte}, {sanfte}, {suo[z]e}, {sw[a]re}.    3. By adding {-l[i]che} or {-l[i]chen} to the adjective, as {ganz}, _whole_,  {vl[i][z]ec}, _diligent_: adv. {ganzl[i]che(n), vl[i][z]ecl[i]che(n)}.    4. The comparative and superlative degrees of adverbs are the same as  the corresponding uninflected forms of the adjectives without umlaut:--      Adjective lanc, _long_  lenger         lengest.    Adverb    lange         langer         langest                      (OHG. lang[o]r)  (OHG. lang[o]st).      Sec. 61.    The following are irregular:--      wol, _well_   ba[z], _better_                best(e), _best_.                  wirs, _worse_                wirsest, wirste, _worst_.                  min, minner, minre, _less_   minnest, minste, _least_.                  m[e], m[e]r, m[e]re, _more_        meist, meiste, _most_.                  [e], _formerly_                [e]r(e)st, [e]rste, _first_.      Sec. 62.    D. NUMERALS.      CARDINAL.

The dat.  {einme} is generally contracted to {eime} (Sec. 9, 3). When {ein} is used in  the sense of _alone_, it follows the weak declension. On the inflexion  of {ander}, _second_, see Sec. 55. {Zwei} and {dr[i]} are declined as  follows:--                _Masc._           _Neut._         _Fem._      Nom. Acc. zw[e]ne             zwei            zw[o], zwuo, zw[a]         Gen. zwei(g)er (Sec. 35)   zwei(g)er       zwei(g)er         Dat. zwein, zweien     zwein, zweien   zwein, zweien      Nom.

The other cardinals up to twelve are sometimes inflected; when such is  the case the endings are:--           _Masc. and Fem._   _Neut._      Nom. Acc.  -e             -iu         Gen.  -er            -er         Dat.  -en            -en      {hundert} and {t[u]sent} are neuter nouns.          CHAPTER V      PRONOUNS    Sec. 65.    1.

For    {[e:][z]} the form {i[z]} sometimes appears.      2. For the acc. pl. {unsich} the dat. {uns} is mostly used. {iu} is    often used for {iuch}, and _vice versa_. {im}, {ir} are more usual    than {ime}, {ire}.      3. The unstressed forms of personal pronouns are often attached to    other words, as {ich[z]}, {i[z]} = {ich [e:][z]}; {ichne}, {ine}, {ichn}    = {ich ne} (_not_); {tuostu} = {tuost du}; {dune}, {dun} = {du ne}    (_not_); {tuo[z]} = {tuo [e:][z]}; {eist}, {[e]st} = {[e:][z] ist}; {dei[z]}    = {da[z] [e:][z]}; {mohter} = {mohte [e:]r}; {baten} = {bat in}; {wir[z]}    = {wir [e:][z]}, &c.

Sec."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22656"],[0,"Red Cap Tales, Stolen from the Treasure Chest of the Wizard of the North (#11)"],[1," covered Balmawhapple himself  with dirt and stones. An immediate retreat of the command took place  without having been specially ordered.    As they approached Edinburgh, they could see that white wreaths of smoke  circled the Castle. The cannonade rolled continuously. Balmawhapple,  however, warned by what had happened at Stirling, gave the Castle a wide  berth, and finally, without having entered the city, he delivered up  his prisoner at the door of the ancient palace of Holyrood.    And so, for the time being, Edward's adventures in the wild Highlands  were ended.      INTERLUDE OF STICKING-PLASTER        This time the children were frankly delighted.        \"It's just like _Kidnapped_, father,\" cried Hugh      John, more truly than he dreamed of, \"there's the      Flight through the Heather, you remember, and the      tall man is Allan Breck, heading off the soldiers      after the Red Fox was shot. There was a sentinel      that whistled, too--Allan heard him when he was      fishing, and learned the tune--oh, and a lot of      things the same!\"        \"I like the part best where Alice Bean gives him      the papers,\" said Sweetheart; \"perhaps she was in      love with him, too.\"        \"Pshaw!\" cried Toady Lion; \"much good that did him.      He never even got them looked at. But it was a pity      that he did not get a chance at a King George      soldier with that lovely sword and steel pistol.      The Highlanders had all the luck.\"        \"I would have banged it off anyway,\" declared Hugh      John; \"fancy carrying a pistol like that all the      way, scouting and going Indian file, and never      getting a shot at anybody!\"        \"What I want to know,\" said Sweetheart, dreamily,      \"is why they all thought Edward a traitor. I      believe the papers that Alice Bean Lean put in his      bag would reveal the secret, if Waverley only had      time to read them.\"        \"Him,\" said Sir Toady, naturally suspicious of all      girls' heroes, \"why, he's always falling down and      getting put to bed. Then somebody has to nurse      him. Why doesn't he go out and fight, like Fergus      Mac-Ivor? Then perhaps Flora would have him; though      what he wanted her for--a girl--I don't know. She      could only play harps and--make poetry.\"        So with this bitter scorn for the liberal arts,      they all rushed off to enact the whole story, the      tale-teller consenting, as occasion required, to      take the parts of the wounded smith, the stern      judge, or the Cameronian Captain. Hugh John      hectored insufferably as Waverley. Sir Toady      scouted and stalked as the tall Highlander, whom he      refused to regard as anybody but Allan Breck.      Sweetheart moved gently about as Alice      Bean--preparing breakfast was quite in her      line--while Maid Margaret, wildly excited, ran      hither and thither as a sort of impartial chorus,      warning all and sundry of the movements of the      enemy.        I saw her last, seated on a knoll and calling out      \"Bang\" at the pitch of her voice. She was, she      explained, nothing less imposing than the castle of      Edinburgh itself, cannonading the ranks of the      Pretender. While far away, upon wooden chargers,      Balmawhapple's cavalry curvetted on the slopes of      Arthur's Seat and cracked vain pistols at the      frowning fortress. There was, in fact, all through      the afternoon, a great deal of imagination loose in      our neighbourhood. And even far into the gloaming      sounds of battle, boastful recriminations, the      clash of swords, the trample and rally of the heavy      charge, even the cries of the genuinely wounded,      came fitfully from this corner and that of the wide      shrubberies.        And when all was over, as they sat reunited, Black      Hanoverian and White Cockade, victor and      vanquished, in the kindly truce of the      supper-table, Hugh John delivered his verdict.        \"That's the best tale you have told us yet. Every      man of us needed to have sticking-plaster put on      when we came in--even Sweetheart!\"        Than which, of course, nothing _could_ have been      more satisfactory.          THE FIFTH TALE FROM \"WAVERLEY\"      THE WHITE COCKADE    IT was Fergus Mac-Ivor himself who welcomed Edward within the palace of  Holyrood, where the adventurous Prince now kept his court.    Hardly would he allow Edward even to ask news of Flora, before carrying  him off into the presence-chamber to be presented. Edward was deeply  moved by the Chevalier's grace and dignity, as well as moved by the  reception he received. The Prince praised the deeds of his ancestors,  and called upon him to emulate them. He also showed him a proclamation  in which his name was mentioned along with those of the other rebels as  guilty of high treason. Edward's heart was melted. This princely  kindness, so different from the treatment which he had received at the  hands of the English government, the direct appeal of the handsome and  gallant young Chevalier, perhaps also the thought of pleasing Flora in  the only way open to him, all overwhelmed the young man, so that, with a  sudden burst of resolve, he knelt down and devoted his life and his  sword to the cause of King James.    The Prince raised and embraced Waverley, and in a few words confided to  him that the English general, having declined battle and gone north to  Aberdeen, had brought his forces back to Dunbar by sea. Here it was the  Prince's instant intention to attack him.    Before taking leave he presented Edward with the splendid silver-hilted  sword which he wore, itself an heirloom of the Stuarts. Then he gave him  over into the hands of Fergus Mac-Ivor, who forthwith proceeded to make  Waverley into a true son of Ivor by arraying him in the tartan of the  clan, with plaid floating over his shoulder and buckler glancing upon  his arm.    Soon after came the Baron of Bradwardine, anxious about the honour of  his young friend Edward. He said that he desired to know the truth as  to the manner in which Captain Waverley had lost his commission in  Colonel Gardiner's dragoons,--so that, if he should hear his honour  called in question, he might be able to defend it,--which, no doubt, he  would have performed as stoutly and loyally as he had previously done  upon the sulky person of the Laird of Balmawhapple.    The morrow was to be a day of battle. But it was quite in keeping with  the gay character of the adventurer-prince, that the evening should be  spent in a hall in the ancient palace of Holyrood. Here Edward, in his  new full dress as a Highlander and a son of Ivor, shone as the  handsomest and the boldest of all. And this, too, in spite of the marked  coldness with which Flora treated him. But to make amends, Rose  Bradwardine, close by her friend's side, watched him with a sigh on her  lip, and colour on her cheek--yet with a sort of pride, too, that she  should have been the first to discover what a gallant and soldierly  youth he was. Jacobite or Hanoverian, she cared not. At Tully-Veolan or  at a court ball, she was equally proud of Edward Waverley.      Next morning our hero was awakened by the screaming of the warpipes  outside his bedroom, and Callum Beg, his attendant, informed him that  he would have to hurry if he wished to come up with Fergus and the Clan  Ivor, who had marched out with the Prince when the morning was yet grey.    Thus spurred, Edward proved himself no laggard. On they went, threading  their way through the ranks of the Highland army, now getting mixed up  with Balmawhapple's horsemen, who, careless of discipline, went spurring  through the throng amid the curses of the Highlanders. For the first  time Edward saw with astonishment that more than half the clansmen were  poorly armed, many with only a scythe on a pole or a sword without a  scabbard, while some for a weapon had nothing better than their dirks,  or even a stake pulled out of the hedge. Then it was that Edward, who  hitherto had only seen the finest and best armed men whom Fergus could  place in the field, began to harbour doubts as to whether this  unmilitary array could defeat a British army, and win the crown of three  kingdoms for the young Prince with whom he had rashly cast in his lot.    [Illustration: \"ROSE BRADWARDINE, close by her friend's side, watched  him with a sigh on her lip, and colour on her cheek--yet with a sort of  pride, too, that she should have been the first to discover what a  gallant and soldierly youth he was.\"]    But his dismal and foreboding thoughts were quickly changed to pride  when whole Clan Ivor received him with a unanimous shout and the braying  of their many warpipes.    \"Why,\" said one of a neighbouring clan, \"you greet the young Sassenach  as if he were the Chief himself!\"    \"If he be not Bran, he is Bran's brother!\" replied Evan Dhu, who was now  very grand under the name of Ensign Maccombich.    \"Oh, then,\" replied the other, \"that will doubtless be the young English  duinhe-wassel who is to be married to the Lady Flora?\"    \"That may be or that may not be,\" retorted Evan, grimly; \"it is no  matter of yours or mine, Gregor.\"    The march continued--first by the shore toward Musselburgh and then  along the top of a little hill which looked out seaward. While marching  thus, news came that Bradwardine's horse had had a skirmish with the  enemy, and had sent in some prisoners.    Almost at the same moment from a sort of stone shed (called a sheep  smearing-house) Edward heard a voice which, as if in agony, tried to  repeat snatches of the Lord's Prayer. He stopped. It seemed as if he  knew that voice.    He entered, and found in the corner a wounded man lying very near to  death.
