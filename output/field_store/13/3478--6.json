A sergeant unfastened the message from the dog's collar and posted off  to the colonel with it.    The message was similar to one which had been telephoned to each of the  supporting bodies, to right and to left of the Here-We-Comes. It bade  the colonel prepare to withdraw his command from the front trenches at  nightfall, and to move back on the main force behind the hill-crest.  The front trenches were not important; and they were far too lightly  manned to resist a mass attack. Wherefore the drawing-in and  consolidating of the whole outflung line.    Bruce, his work done now, had leisure to respond to the countless  offers of hospitality that encompassed him. One man brought him a slice  of cold broiled bacon. Another spread pork-grease over a bit of bread  and proffered it. A third unearthed from some sacredly guarded  hiding-place an excessively stale half-inch square of sweet chocolate.    Had the dog so chosen, he might then and there have eaten himself to  death on the multitude of votive offerings. But in a few minutes he had  had enough, and he merely sniffed in polite refusal at all further  gifts.    \"See?\" lectured Mahan. \"That's the beast of it! When you say a fellow  eats or drinks 'like a beast,' you ought to remember that a beast won't  eat or drink a mouthful more than is good for him.\"    \"Gee!\" commented the somewhat corpulent Dale. \"I'm glad I'm not a  beast--especially on pay-day.\"    Presently Bruce tired of the ovation tendered him. These ovations were  getting to be an old story. They had begun as far back as his  training-camp days--when the story of his joining the army was told by  the man to whom The Place's guest had written commending the dog to the  trainers' kindness.    At the training-camp this story had been reenforced by the chief  collie-teacher--a dour little Hieland Scot named McQuibigaskie, who on  the first day declared that the American dog had more sense and more  promise and more soul \"than a' t'other tykes south o' Kirkcudbright  Brae.\"    Being only mortal, Bruce found it pleasanter to be admired and petted  than ignored or kicked. He was impersonally friendly with the soldiers,  when he was off duty; and he relished the dainties they were forever  thrusting at him.    But at times his soft eyes would grow dark with homesickness for the  quiet loveliness of The Place and for the Mistress and the Master who  were his loyally worshiped gods. Life had been so happy and so sweetly  uneventful for him, at The Place! And there had been none of the awful  endless thunder and the bewilderingly horrible smells and gruesome  sights which here met him at every turn.    The dog's loving heart used to grow sick with it all; and he longed  unspeakably for home. But he was a gallant soldier, and he did his work  not only well, but with a snap and a dash and an almost uncanny  intelligence which made him an idol to the men.    Presently, now, having eaten all he wanted and having been patted and  talked to until he craved solitude, Bruce strolled ever to an empty  dugout, curled up on a torn blanket there, put his nose between his  white paws and went to sleep.    The German artillery-fire had swelled from an occasional explosion to a  ceaseless roar, that made the ground vibrate and heave, and that beat  on the eardrums with nauseating iterance. But it did not bother Bruce.  For months he had been used to this sort of annoyance, and he had  learned to sleep snugly through it all.    Meanwhile, outside his dugout, life was speeding up at a dizzying rate.  The German artillery had sprung to sudden and wholesale activity. Far  to the right of the Here-We-Come regiment's trenches a haze had begun  to crawl along the ground and to send snaky tendrils high in  air-tendrils that blended into a single grayish-green wall as they  moved forward. The hazewall's gray-green was shot by yellow and purple  tinges as the sun's weak rays touched it. To the left of the  Here-We-Comes, and then in front of them, appeared the same wall of  billowing gas.    The Here-We-Comes were ready for it with their hastily donned masks.  But there was no need of the precaution. By one of the sudden  wind--freaks so common in the story of the war, the gas-cloud was cleft  in two by a swirling breeze, and it rolled dankly on, to right and  left, leaving the central trenches clear.    Now, an artillery barrage, accompanied or followed by a  gas-demonstration, can mean but one thing: a general attack. Therefore  telephonic word came to the detachments to left and right of the  Here-We-Comes, to fall back, under cover of the gas-cloud, to safer  positions. Two dogs were sent, with the same order, to the  Here-We-Comes. (One of the dogs was gassed. A bit of shrapnel found the  other.)    Thus it was that the Here-We-Comes were left alone (though they did not  know it), to hold the position,--with no support on either side, and  with a mere handful of men wherewith to stem the impending rush.    On the heels of the dispersing gas-cloud, and straight across the  half-mile or less of broken ground, came a line of gray. In five  successive waves, according to custom, the boches charged. Each wave  hurled itself forward as fast as efficiency would let it, in face of  the opposing fire, and as far as human endurance would be goaded. Then  it went down, and its survivors attached themselves to the succeeding  wave.    Hence, by the time the fifth and mightiest wave got into motion, it was  swelled by the survivors of all four of its predecessors and was an  all-but-resistless mass of shouting and running men.    The rifles and machine-guns of the Here-We-Comes played merrily into  the advancing gray swarms, stopping wave after wave, and at last  checking the fifth and \"master\" wave almost at the very brink of the  Franco-American parapet.    \"That's how they do!\" Mahan pantingly explained to a rather shaky  newcomer, as the last wave fell back. \"They count on numbers and  bullrushes to get them there. If they'd had ten thousand men, in that  rush, instead of five thousand, they'd have got us. And if they had  twice as many men in their whole army as they have, they'd win this  war. But praise be, they haven't twice as many! That is one of the  fifty-seven reasons why the Allies are going to lick Germany.\"    Mahan talked jubilantly. The same jubilation ran all along the line of  victors. But the colonel and his staff were not rejoicing. They had  just learned of the withdrawal of the forces to either side of them,  and they knew they themselves could not hope to stand against a second  and larger charge.    Such a charge the enemy were certain to make. The Germans, too, must  soon learn of the defection of the supports. It was now only a question  of an hour or less before a charge with a double-enveloping movement  would surround and bag the Here-We-Comes, catching the whole regiment  in an inescapable trap.    To fall back, now, up that long bare hillside, under full fire of the  augmented German artillery, would mean a decimating of the entire  command. The Here-We-Comes could not retreat. They could not hope to  hold their ground. The sole chance for life lay in the arrival of  strong reenforcements from the rear, to help them hold the trenches  until night, or to man the supporting positions. Reserves were within  easy striking distance. But, as happened so many times in the war,  there was no routine way to summon them in time.    It was the chance sight of a crumpled message lying on his dugout-table  that reminded the colonel of Bruce's existence and of his presence in  the front trench. It was a matter of thirty seconds for the colonel to  scrawl an urgent appeal and a brief statement of conditions. Almost as  soon as the note was ready, an orderly appeared at the dugout entrance,  convoying the newly awakened Bruce.    The all-important message was fastened in place. The colonel himself  went to the edge of the traverse, and with his own arms lifted the  eighty-pound collie to the top.    There was tenderness as well as strength in the lifting arms. As he set  Bruce down on the brink, the colonel said, as if speaking to a  fellow-human:    \"I hate to do it, old chap. I HATE to! There isn't one chance in three  of your getting all the way up the hill alive. But there wouldn't be  one chance in a hundred, for a MAN. The boches will be on the lookout  for just this move. And their best sharpshooters will be waiting for  you--even if you dodge the shrapnel and the rest of the artillery. I'm  sorry! And--good-by.\"    Then, tersely, he rasped out the command--    \"Bruce! Headquarters! Headquarters! QUICK!\"    At a bound, the dog was gone.    Breasting the rise of the hill, Bruce set off at a sweeping run, his  tawny-and-white mane flying in the wind.    A thousand eyes, from the Here-We-Come trenches, watched his flight.  And as many eyes from the German lines saw the huge collie's dash up  the coverless slope.    Scarce had Bruce gotten fairly into his stride when the boche bullets  began to sing--not a desultory little flurry of shots, as before; but  by the score, and with a murderous earnestness. When he had appeared,  on his way to the trenches, an hour earlier, the Germans had opened  fire on him, merely for their own amusement--upon the same merry  principle which always led them to shoot at an Ally war-dog. But now  they understood his all-important mission; and they strove with their  best skill to thwart it.    The colonel of the Here-We-Comes drew his breath sharply between his  teeth. He did not regret the sending of the collie. It had been a move  of stark military necessity. And there was an off chance that it might  mean the saving of his whole command.    But the colonel was fond of Bruce, and it angered him to hear the  frantic effort of the boche marksmen to down so magnificent a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2392"],[0,"Further Adventures of Lad (#11)"],[1,"fts.    No, the bag was his enemy. And, unlike his few other natural foes, Lad  had never been bidden to leave it unmolested. This memory came to him,  in the midst of his blues. He eyed the loathsome suitcase through  quizzical half-shut eyes, as it rocked and careened at his feet with  every jounce of the car. And into his brain shot the devil of mischief.    Bending down his shapely head, he took the handle of the case between  his teeth. Then, bracing his little white forepaws on the slippery  leather seat, he heaved with all the mighty strength of his back and  shoulders. Under such urgence, the light suitcase swung high in air. A  sideways toss of the muscular throat, and the suitcase whirled clear of  the car door and of the running-board beneath. Then Lad let go; and  settled himself back smugly in the seat. The luckless suitcase smote  the road dust and rolled into a grassy ditch. The car sped on. Lad, for  the moment, was nearly happy. If he were not able to dodge the show  itself, at least he had gotten rid of the odious thing which held so  much he detested and which was always an inseparable part of the  ordeals he was taken to.    Arrived at the country club whose grounds had been fitted for the  charity show, Lad was benched in the shade. And there, all the rest of  the morning, he remained. For Loder, judge of the collies and Old  English Sheepdogs and of two other breeds, had missed a train from  Canada; and had not yet arrived. His various classes were held up,  pending his advent.    \"Loder's a lucky man, at that,\" commented the Toy Breeds judge, with  whom the Master chanced to be talking. \"And he'll be still luckier if  he misses the whole show. You 'small exhibitors' have no notion of the  rotten deal handed to a dog-show judge;--though lots of you do more  than your share toward making his life a burden. Before the judging  begins, some of the exhibitors act as if they wanted to kiss him.  Nothing's too good for him. He wades chin-deep through flattery and  loving attentions. Then, after the judging is over, he is about as  popular with those same exhibitors as a typhoid germ. No one can say  bad enough things about him. He's 'incompetent,' he's 'a  grafter,--'he's 'afraid of the big kennels,'--he's 'drunk.' He's any of  these things; or all of them put together. Nobody's satisfied.  Everybody has had a raw deal. Everybody's hammer is out for the poor  slob of a judge. Well, not everybody's, of course. There are some real  sportsmen left crawling on the surface of the earth. But the big  majority pan him, all the way home; and then some of them roast him in  print. The Income Tax man is a popular favorite, compared with a  dog-show judge.\"    \"But--\"    \"Then, again,\" pursued the Toy Breeds man, \"he's got to leave his heart  at home, if he doesn't want it to ache when he has to 'gate' the  second-rate mutts shown by outsiders who never exhibited before and who  think their pet dog ought to get every prize because he's so cunning  and friendly. I hate to--\"    The Mistress came hurrying up from a careful inspection of the line of  collies. Drawing her husband aside, she whispered, excitedly:    \"There's only one other collie here, whose coat can anywhere near equal  Laddie's. The rest are all in shabby summer coat. Come across and let  me show him to you. I'm--I'm afraid he has a gorgeous coat. Not that  _I_ think it's half as good as Lad's,\" she added, loyally, as she  piloted the Master between the double lines of clamorous dogs.  \"But--oh, I'm so afraid the judge may think it is! You see, he doesn't  know Laddie as we do.\"    She stopped before a bench whereon lay a pale golden sable collie;  almost corn-colored; who boasted a wealth and magnificence of coat that  made the Master open his eyes wide.    The dog was smaller and slighter of frame than was Lad. Nor, in head  and expression, was he Lad's equal. But his coat was every bit as  luxuriant. Indeed, there was perhaps a shade more of it than Lad  carried.    A collie's coat, as a rule, takes about seven months to grow. Thus,  each year, it comes into full bloom a little later than on the year  before. And, in course of time, it is prone to reach its climax of  excellence in summer. This was the lot of both Lad and the paler-hued  dog.    \"Lochaber King,\" read the Master, from his catalog. \"H'm! That's  Colonel Osbourne's greatest pup. Remember, we saw him at Westminster?  It's nip-and-tuck, between him and Lad; with a little in this dog's  favor. Tough luck!\"    \"Oh, this has been just one of those days nobody wants!\" mourned the  Mistress. \"First, our forgetting to bring along Laddie's suitcase,  though I could have sworn I saw you lift it aboard,--and then the judge  not being here; and now this horrid collie with his wonderful coat!  What next, I wonder?\"    Like a well-staged bit of mechanism, the reply to her rhetorical  question came down to her from heaven. It came in the shape of a  thunder-roll that began far off and reverberated from mountain to  mountain; then muttered itself into silence in the more distant hills.  The Mistress, like everyone else, looked skyward.    The hazy blue of the summer noon was paling to dirty gray and black. Up  from the Hudson, a fast-mounting array of dun and flame-shot clouds  were butting their bullying way. No weather-prophet was needed to tell  these hillcountry folk that they were in for a thunderstorm;--and for  what one kennel-man described as \"a reg'lar ol'  he-one,\" at that.    Now, under right conditions, an open-air dogshow is a thing of beauty  and of joy. At such places as Tuxedo and one or two others it is a  sight to be remembered. But in rainy weather,--especially in a  tumultuous thunderstorm, it has not one redeeming feature.    The Beauville Show Committee,--like all experts in such matters, had  taken this chance into account. Down the aisles of benches and through  the questioning and scared groups of exhibitors ran attendants and  officials; shouting that the Country Club polo stables and the wide  spaces under the clubhouse verandas had been fitted up for emergency  quarters, where the dogs might be housed, dry and safe, until the  passing of the storm.    Up to the Master hurried a club page-boy.    \"This way, sir!\" he panted. \"I saved a special box stall, in the first  stable, for your collie.\"    \"YOU saved it?\" queried the puzzled Master, while the Mistress began to  unfasten Lad's leash. \"How did you happen to do that?\"    \"I was told to, sir,\" answered the boy. \"A--a gentleman told me to,  just now. One of the of'cers of the club. I don't know his name. He  showed me the stall; and he told me to take your dog there.\"    \"That's mighty, decent; whoever did it,\" said the Master, whistling the  freed dog to him and setting forth in the boy's wake, toward the  welcoming stables. \"I wish you knew his name. I'd like to thank him.\"    The stable was dim-lit, at best. Now, the gathering storm made it as  dark as twilight. The box stall to which Lad was led was almost pitch  black; its shuttered window being closed. Still, it was shelter.  Leaving the Master and the Mistress to consign Lad to his new quarters,  the boy scuttled of to a harness-room. There, an eagerly-questioning  man was awaiting him.    \"Yep,\" broke in the boy, through a volley of inquiries. \"I done it, all  right, all right, Mr. Higham. They're moorin' him in Stall Five, right  now. How about those two soft dollars? Hey?\"    \"You earned 'em, O. K.,\" grinned Higham. \"Here you are. Two,--count  'em, two. And now, chase along, sonny. I'm busy.\"    He turned to a large bowl in which he had been mixing the contents of  three or four bottles. And the boy saw his fingers were fiery red.    \"What's the matter?\" demanded the youngster, in high excitement.  \"That's blood, ain't it?\"    \"No,\" denied Higham. \"Blood's light red. This is crimson. Remember the  time we run in that joke on Daddy Price, by dipping his prize white  leghorns in crimson dye, just before the Madison Square Garden Poultry  Show? Well, this is the same stuff.\"    \"Do I remember it?\" snickered the boy. \"He was ragin', for fair.  Couldn't get it off, to save him. It stayed, that color, on 'em, till  they'd shed the last one of last year's crop of feathers. Sure, I  remember. Why wouldn't I? Didn't I git a dollar for holdin' 'em for  you? And another dollar for keepin' my mouth shut? But what are you  lottin' to do with the stuff, this time? No chickens here;  or--\"    \"Nope,\" assented Higham. \"No chickens here. Hold on, a second!\"    He stood, musing. Then he spoke.    \"I was going to play a lone hand, on this,\" he said, presently. \"I  didn't even dare let Rice in on it. He'd be dead-sure to tell that  gabby girl he's going to marry. And it'd get all over the country in a  week. And that'd lose me my job, if the boss heard of it. I was going  to play it alone. That's why I left Rice and Willett to put up the dogs  for me. But,--I'm blest if I know how I'm to hold him and dye him at  the same time. He's as strong as an ox. You--you're a good,  close-tongued kid, Harry. You kept your mouth shut about Price's  chickens. Could you keep it shut,--for another dollar,--about this? If  you'll do that, and lend me a hand--How about it?\"    \"What's the main idea?\" asked the boy, much intrigued by the beauty of  the dye on Higham's fingers; and squirming with embarrassed  self-importance at the man's flattering tone. \"I'll help out, all  right. Only,--\"    \"Here's the notion,\" said Higham, coming out of momentary  self-communion. \"And if you ever spill it, your mail will be sent to  you at the hosp't'l, for a spell. You saw that big dark sable collie I  had you steer into Stall Five? It cost me another two dollars to get  Abrams to let me have the use of that stall. The idea come to me, in a  jolt, first crack of thunder I heard. Well, I'm due to 'get' that dog  and the mucker who owns him, too. Them and I had a run-in, once; and I  been honing for a"]]]
