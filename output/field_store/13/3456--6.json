Streams of this character are occasionally met with, and  it is important to know how to cross them with the greatest promptitude  and safety.    A train of wagons having arrived upon the bank of such a stream, first  select the best point for the passage, where the banks upon both sides  require the least excavation for a place of ingress and egress to and  from the river. As I have before remarked, the place of entering the  river should be above the coming-out place on the opposite bank, as the  current will then assist in carrying wagons and animals across. A spot  should be sought where the bed of the stream is firm at the place where  the animals are to get out on the opposite bank. If, however, no such  place can be found, brush and earth should be thrown in to make a  foundation sufficient to support the animals, and to prevent them from  bogging. After the place for crossing has been selected, it will be  important to determine the breadth of the river between the points of  ingress and egress, in order to show the length of rope necessary to  reach across. A very simple practical method of doing this without  instruments is found in the French \"Manuel du Genie.\" It is as follows:    [Illustration: The line AB (the distance to be measured) is extended  upon the bank to D, from which point, after having marked it, lay off  equal distances, DC and C_d_; produce BC to _b_, making CB=C_b_; then  extend the line _db_ until it intersects the prolongation of the line  through CA at _a_. The distance between _ab_ is equal to AB, or the  width of the crossing.]    A man who is an expert swimmer then takes the end of a fishing-line or  a small cord in his mouth, and carries it across, leaving the other end  fixed upon the opposite bank, after which a lariat is attached to the  cord, and one end of it pulled across and made fast to a tree; but if  there is nothing convenient to which the lariat can be attached, an  extra axle or coupling-pole can be pulled over by the man who has  crossed, firmly planted in the ground, and the rope tied to it. The  rope must be long enough to extend twice across the stream, so that one  end may always be left on each shore. A very good substitute for a  ferry-boat may be made with a wagon-bed by filling it with empty  water-casks, stopped tight and secured in the wagon with ropes, with a  cask lashed opposite the centre of each outside. It is then placed in  the water bottom upward, and the rope that has been stretched across  the stream attached to one end of it, while another rope is made fast  to the other end, after which it is loaded, the shore-end loosened, and  the men on the opposite bank pull it across to the landing, where it is  discharged and returned for another load, and so on until all the  baggage and men are passed over.    The wagons can be taken across by fastening them down to the axles,  attaching a rope to the end of the tongue, and another to the rear of  each to steady it and hold it from drifting below the landing. It is  then pushed into the stream, and the men on the opposite bank pull it  over. I have passed a large train of wagons in this way across a rapid  stream fifteen feet deep without any difficulty. I took, at the same  time, a six-pounder cannon, which was separated from its carriage, and  ferried over upon the wagon-boat; after which the carriage was pulled  over in the same way as described for the wagons.    There are not always a sufficient number of airtight water-casks to  fill a wagon-bed, but a tentfly, paulin, or wagon-cover can generally  be had. In this event, the wagon-bed may be placed in the centre of one  of these, the cloth brought up around the ends and sides, and secured  firmly with ropes tied around transversely, and another rope fastened  lengthwise around under the rim. This holds the cloth in its place, and  the wagon may then be placed in the water right side upward, and  managed in the same manner as in the other case. If the cloth be made  of cotton, it will soon swell so as to leak but very little, and  answers a very good purpose.    Another method of ferrying streams is by means of what is called by the  mountaineers a \"_bull-boat_,\" the frame-work of which is made of  willows bent into the shape of a short and wide skiff, with a flat  bottom. Willows grow upon the banks of almost all the streams on the  prairies, and can be bent into any shape desired. To make a boat with  but one hide, a number of straight willows are cut about an inch in  diameter, the ends sharpened and driven into the ground, forming a  frame-work in the shape of a half egg-shell cut through the  longitudinal axis. Where these rods cross they are firmly secured with  strings. A stout rod is then heated and bent around the frame in such a  position that the edges of the hide, when laid over it and drawn tight,  will just reach it. This rod forms the gunwale, which is secured by  strings to the ribs. Small rods are then wattled in so as to make it  symmetrical and strong. After which the green or soaked hide is thrown  over the edges, sewed to the gunwales, and left to dry. The rods are  then cut off even with the gunwale, and the boat is ready for use.    To build a boat with two or more hides: A stout pole of the desired  length is placed upon the ground for a keel, the ends turned up and  secured by a lariat; willow rods of the required dimensions are then  cut, heated, and bent into the proper shape for knees, after which  their centres are placed at equal distances upon the keel, and firmly  tied with cords. The knees are retained in their proper curvature by  cords around the ends. After a sufficient number of them have been  placed upon the keel, two poles of suitable dimensions are heated, bent  around the ends for a gunwale, and firmly lashed to each knee. Smaller  willows are then interwoven, so as to model the frame.    Green or soaked hides are cut into the proper shape to fit the frame,  and sewed together with buckskin strings; then the frame of the boat is  placed in the middle, the hide drawn up snug around the sides, and  secured with raw-hide thongs to the gunwale. The boat is then turned  bottom upward and left to dry, after which the seams where they have  been sewed are covered with a mixture of melted tallow and pitch: the  craft is now ready for launching.    A boat of this kind is very light and serviceable, but after a while  becomes water-soaked, and should always be turned bottom upward to dry  whenever it is not in the water. Two men can easily build a _bull-boat_  of three hides in two days which will carry ten men with perfect safety.    A small party traveling with a pack train and arriving upon the banks  of a deep stream will not always have the time to stop or the means to  make any of the boats that have been described. Should their luggage be  such as to become seriously injured by a wetting, and there be an  India-rubber or gutta-percha cloth disposable, or if even a green beef  or buffalo hide can be procured, it may be spread out upon the ground,  and the articles of baggage placed in the centre, in a square or  rectangular form; the ends and sides are then brought up so as entirely  to envelop the package, and the whole secured with ropes or raw hide.  It is then placed in the water with a rope attached to one end, and  towed across by men in the same manner as the boats before described.  If hides be used they will require greasing occasionally, to prevent  their becoming water-soaked.    [Illustration: CROSSING A STREAM.]    When a mounted party with pack animals arrive upon the borders of a  rapid stream, too deep to ford, and where the banks are high and  abrupt, with perhaps but one place where the beasts can get out upon  the opposite shore, it would not be safe to drive or ride them in,  calculating that all will make the desired landing. Some of them will  probably be carried by the swift current too far down the stream, and  thereby endanger not only their own lives, but the lives of their  riders. I have seen the experiment tried repeatedly, and have known  several animals to be carried by the current below the point of egress,  and thus drowned. Here is a simple, safe, and expeditious method of  taking animals over such a stream. Suppose, for example, a party of  mounted men arrive upon the bank of the stream. There will always be  some good swimmers in the party, and probably others who can not swim  at all. Three or four of the most expert of these are selected, and  sent across with one end of a rope made of lariats tied together, while  the other end is retained upon the first bank, and made fast to the  neck of a gentle and good swimming horse; after which another gentle  horse is brought up and made fast by a lariat around his neck to the  tail of the first, and so on until all the horses are thus tied  together. The men who can not swim are then mounted upon the best  swimming horses and tied on, otherwise they are liable to become  frightened, lose their balance, and be carried away in a rapid current;  or a horse may stumble and throw his rider. After the horses have been  strung out in a single line by their riders, and every thing is in  readiness, the first horse is led carefully into the water, while the  men on the opposite bank, pulling upon the rope, thus direct him  across, and, if necessary, aid him in stemming the current. As soon as  this horse strikes bottom he pulls upon those behind him, and thereby  assists them in making the landing, and in this manner all are passed  over in perfect safety.      DRIVING LOOSE HORSES.    In traveling with loose horses across the plains, some persons are in  the habit of attaching them in pairs by their halters to a long, stout  rope stretched between two wagons drawn by mules, each wagon being  about half loaded. The principal object of the rear wagon being to hold  back and keep the rope stretched,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23186"],[0,"The Handbook to English Heraldry (#11)"],[1,"of antiquity,  and which contributed in so important a degree to their own defensive  equipment, was considered by those armour-clad warriors to be peculiarly  qualified to display their heraldic blazonry. And, in later times, when  armour had ceased to be worn, and when shields no longer were actually  used, a Shield continued to be regarded as the most appropriate vehicle  for the same display. The Shield, then, which with its armorial devices  constitutes a _Shield of Arms_, always is considered to display its  blazonry upon its face or external surface. This blazoned surface of his  shield the bearer, when holding it before his person, presents (or would  present, were he so to hold it) towards those who confront him. The  right and the left sides of the person of the bearer of a Shield,  consequently, are _covered_ by the right and left (in heraldic language,  the _dexter_ and _sinister_) sides of his shield: and so, from this it  follows that the dexter and sinister sides of a Shield of Arms are  severally _opposite_ to the left and the right hands of all observers.  The Parts and Points of an heraldic Shield, which is also entitled an  \"_Escutcheon_,\" are thus distinguished:--      [Illustration: No. 27.]      No. 27. A, _The chief_:            B, _The Base_:            C, _The Dexter Side_:            D, _The Sinister Side_:            E, _The Dexter Chief_:            F, _The Sinister Chief_:            G, _The Middle Chief_:            H, _The Dexter Base_:            I, _The Sinister Base_:            K, _The Middle Base_:[2]            L, _The Honour Point_:            M, _The Fesse Point_.        [Footnote 2: This term is very seldom if ever used.]    In blazoning the Divisions of a Shield, the term \"_Per_,\" signifying \"in  the direction of,\" is employed sometimes alone, and sometimes (having  the same signification) preceded by the word \"parted\" or \"party.\" The  primary Divisions of a Shield are indicated in the following diagrams,  Nos. 28-35:--      [Illustration: Nos. 28-30, 31-33, 34-35.]    No. 28. _Per Pale_, or _Parted per Pale_, or _Party per Pale_.    No. 29. _Per Fesse_, or _Parted per Fesse_.    No. 30. (Nos. 28 and 29 together) _Per Cross_, or _Quarterly_ (the  latter is the more usual term).    No. 31. _Per Bend._ No. 32. _Per Bend Sinister._    No. 33. (Nos. 31 and 32 together) _Per Saltire._    No. 34. _Per Chevron._    No. 35. Tierced in pale (divided into three equal divisions by two  vertical lines), a form seldom met with in English Heraldry. Technically  this in English Heraldry is simply the representation of a pale. (See  No. 87.)    To these divisions should strictly be added the further division  _gyronny_ (No. 147); but neither the term _per_ nor _parted per_ is  ever employed in this connection. As will be seen, it is a combination  of the forms shown in Nos. 30 and 33.    A Shield may be further divided and subdivided, thus:--      [Illustration: No. 36.]      [Illustration: No. 37.]    It may be divided into any number of _Quarterings_ by lines drawn _per  pale_ and _per fesse_, cutting each other, as in No. 36, which Shield is  _quarterly of eight_: in like manner the _Quarterings_ of any Shield,  whatever their number (which need not be an even number), are blazoned  as, _quarterly of twelve, &c._ This, to whatever extent the dividing of  the Shield may be carried, is _simple Quartering_. Again: a quartered  Shield may have one or more of its primary quarters, or every one of  them, _quartered_: this, which is the subdivision of a part, _the  quartering of quarters_, is _compound Quartering_: for example, in No.  37, the Shield is first divided into the _four primary quarters_,  severally marked A, B, C, D; then, so far as the quarters A, B, D are  concerned, the \"simple quartering\" is subjected to the process of  \"compound quartering,\" and quarters A, D are _quarters quarterly_, and B  is _a quarter quarterly of six_, while C remains unaffected by the  secondary process. The terms \"_quarterly quartering_\" and \"_quarterly  quartered_\" are used to signify such secondary quartering as is  exemplified in A, B, D of No. 37. The four primary quarters (A, B, C,  D of No. 37) are distinguished as _Grand Quarters_: consequently, the  quarter B of this example is the _second grand quarter, quarterly of  six_. This term \"Grand Quarter\" may be employed to distinguish any  primary quarter when any quarter in the Shield is \"quarterly quartered.\"    DIVIDING and BORDER LINES, in addition to simple right lines and curves,  assume the forms that are represented in the next diagram, No. 38:--      [Illustration: No. 38.]      No. 38.  A. _Indented_             B. _Dancetté_             C. _Wavy_ or _Undée_ (2 varieties)             D. _Engrailed_             E. _Invected_ or _Invecked_             F. _Embattled_             G. _Raguly_             H. _Nebuly_ (2 varieties)             I. _Dovetailed_    Two others, less frequently met with, however, are _rayonné_ and  _flory-counter-flory_.      [Illustration: No. 39.]      [Illustration: No. 40.]      [Illustration: No. 41.]      [Illustration: No. 42.]      [Illustration: No. 43.]      [Illustration: No. 44.]      [Illustration: No. 45.]      [Illustration: No. 46.]      [Illustration: No. 47.]    THE SHIELD: ITS VARIETIES OF FORM.--The front face of an heraldic Shield  is generally flat; but sometimes the curved edges are made to appear as  if they had been slightly rounded off. Some early Shields are  represented as _bowed_--hollowed, that is, in order to cover more  closely the person of the bearer, and consequently having a convex  external contour, as in No. 39. In early examples of bowed Shields the  whole of the armorial blazonry is sometimes displayed on the face of  that portion of the Shield which is shown. A _ridge_, dividing them in  pale, but not necessarily in any way acting as an heraldic dividing  line, appears in many Shields, and particularly in those of the  fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The large elongated Shields that have  been entitled \"kite-shaped,\" and which were in use in the days of  RICHARD I. and amongst the Barons of Magna Charta, were superseded by  the smaller \"heater-shaped\" Shield as early as the reign of HENRY III.  The most beautiful forms of this Shield are represented in Nos. 40, 41,  and 42: of these, No. 40 has its curves described about the sides of an  inverted equilateral triangle, and then they are prolonged by vertical  lines towards the chief: in Nos. 41, 42, the sides curve from the chief  to the base. The forms of Shields admit of various slight modifications,  to adjust them to varying conditions. Towards the close of the  fourteenth century the form of the Shield is found to undergo some  singular changes: and, at later periods, changes in form of this kind  became generally prevalent. Nos. 43, 44, exemplify such changes as  these: they also show the curved notch that was cut in the dexter chief  of the Shields of the same periods, to permit the lance to pass through  it as the Shield hung down on the breast: a Shield so pierced is said to  be _à bouche_. The Surface of the Shield, No. 43, which is in the  Episcopal palace at Exeter, is wrought into a series of shallow hollows,  which curve gracefully from the central ridge, some to the dexter, and  others to the sinister. Such a Shield as this may be consistently used  in our own Heraldry: but, since now we do not associate lances laid in  rest with our heraldic Shields, it appears desirable that we should not  draw our Shields _à bouche_. In recent Heraldry the Shield has commonly  been made to appear such an unsightly and un-heraldic deformity as is  represented in No. 45. Instead of a true heraldic Shield also, a rounded  oval with a convex surface, called a _cartouche_, or _cartouche shield_,  No. 46, is occasionally used for the display of armorial blazonry; or a  circle is substituted for such an oval. These cartouches probably owe  their origin to the usage of placing a Garter of the Order about a  Shield (prevalent in the fifteenth century), and to a subsequent period,  when we find the omission of the exact outline of the actual Shield. But  their frequent appearance in Ecclesiastical Heraldry suggests that  perhaps they were deliberately preferred to the purely military shield.  A _Lozenge_, No. 47, takes the place of a Shield to bear the arms of  Ladies, with the exception of the Sovereign; this very inconvenient  substitute for the heraldic Shield was introduced early in the  fourteenth century.    THE SHIELD: ITS HERALDIC TREATMENT.--When a Shield is represented as  standing erect, it is not necessary to specify that fact, since such a  position may be assumed for a Shield unless another be set forth in  blazoning. Shields are sometimes made to appear suspended by the  _guige_, or shield-belt (which was worn by Knights to sustain and secure  their Shields to their persons); in some Seals and generally in  architectural compositions, Shields-of-Arms appear suspended, erect,  from their guiges; at Westminster some of the earliest Shields are thus  suspended, with a very happy effect, from two points of suspension, the  guige passing over sculptured heads, as in No. 48, the Arms of Provence,  borne by ALIANORE of Provence, Queen of HENRY III.--the _shield_ is  _gold_, and on it are blazoned _four red pallets_. In Seals, the  suspended Shield is generally represented hanging by the sinister-chief  angle, as in No. 49; and it hangs thus diagonally from below the helm.  A Shield thus placed is said to be \"_couché_.\" This arrangement is also  frequently adopted, when a Shield or an Achievement of arms is not  placed upon a Seal; but in any case the position has no importance  except as a matter of artistic treatment.      [Illustration: No. 48.--Arms of Provence, Westminster Abbey.]      [Illustration: No. 49.--Shield Couché.]    The entire surface of every Shield is termed the \"_Field_.\" The same  term is also"]]]
