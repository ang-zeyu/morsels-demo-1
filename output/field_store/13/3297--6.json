Herodotus was of opinion that the Greeks derived their religion and  superstition from the Egyptians; Plutarch arrived at another  conclusion; while many maintained that Orpheus brought the mysteries  of religion into Greece. Whoever is right, this we know, that the  Greeks became so prone to worship ancient deities, and so anxious to  do homage to all the divinities, that they erected altars to unknown  gods, for fear they would fail in their duty to any power that could  assist them in time of need. Above all gods, Jupiter was held in the  highest esteem. He was regarded as the president of law and justice,  as the protector of cities, as governor and director of their  councils, and as chief of their societies. To him they ascribed  thunder, and supposed it was he who delivered them from the Persians,  and who assisted them to buy and sell to advantage. They erected  altars to him in the courts of their houses and before their gates.  Regarding him as the god of strangers, they received and entertained  visitors with great ceremony. As a sign of fidelity, the right hand of  fellowship was given to a stranger, to whom salt was presented, in  token that his person would be safe under the entertainer's roof. A  stranger's bottle was kept, and when a visitor arrived at the door the  head of the family and he joined feet together on the threshold. A cup  of wine was drunk to an unknown person before his name was asked. To  return respect to those in the house, the stranger did reverence to  the genius of the place, and saluted the ground with a kiss. When one  sojourned in a strange land, he was expected to conform to the  recognised customs thereof; and on taking his departure he not only  bade farewell to those with whom he had become acquainted, but took  leave of their deities. When an important agreement was entered into,  Jupiter was sacrificed to, and called to witness the covenant.    The Greeks purified themselves after frightful dreams; they wore  charmed rings to protect themselves from witchcraft; they were  accustomed to spit three times on seeing a madman; and they spat every  time the devil's name was mentioned in their hearing. Stones were  cast at every cat and weasel met by one when commencing a journey,  and the meeting of a bitch with whelps was carefully avoided. The  crowing of hens and the whistling of maidens were listened to with as  great fear as the hissing of a serpent.    If a rat or a mouse ate a hole in one's clothes, evil, it was thought,  was about to befall the luckless owner. The people had days of good  luck and of bad omen. They cut their hair, and sacrificed it to  rivers. They marked the flight of birds, particularly that of the owl.  On seeing this night bird flying overhead at the battle of Salamis,  the soldiers considered it a good sign, took courage, and won the  fight. When one was going round an altar, he took care to keep his  right hand towards it. People anointed sacred stones in token of  thankfulness, as Jacob poured oil on the stone he took for a pillow at  Bethel.    To know if one was in love, special notice was taken of his garland at  a feast, and from its appearance the wearer's feelings were supposed  to be known, though it might be thought there was no necessity for  such observation; for, according to an old proverb, \"Love and the  cough can never be concealed.\"    If one could not secure a lady's affections in the usual way of  courting, he endeavoured to get something of hers into his possession  in order to bewitch her. Having received a glove, a ring, or any other  article, he operated on it in a magical way, and thus obtained his  desire. If a lady's girdle was properly tied into a true-lover's knot,  she could not resist loving him who performed the charming trick.  Another way of softening a woman's heart was by throwing a bitten  apple into her lap. If she received it and ate the fruit, her  affections were won. All the tokens and charms did not come from the  gentleman's side, for it was not unusual for a lady, when she wanted  to control a lover's affections, to send him charmed garlands, roses,  or bitten apples.    On the wedding day, a bride, on coming to the house of her husband,  found the doors hung with garlands made of herbs, flowers, and plants  consecrated to certain gods and goddesses, which possessed peculiar  virtues suitable for the occasion. Cakes were bestowed on the bride on  her marriage day; and there was a custom among the Greeks and Romans  of combing her hair with a spear which had belonged to a man that lost  his life in a fight, or with a weapon that had been used in killing a  man. If this was done, she was sure to have brave sons. As the bride  rose to leave her father's house, she was carried over the threshold;  and as she entered her husband's house, a practice similar to that  observed among other nations was followed,--throwing figs and other  fruit at her head, as an omen of fruitfulness. It was also the custom  for a servant, on first coming into his new home, to have palm  branches and various ornaments placed on his head, to secure  prosperity. As the bride was led into her chamber, there was a sieve  carried along with her, and a pestle hung at the door, implying that  afterwards she was to assist in the household duties. When the bride  and bridegroom were together in the house, they ate an apple between  them, to signify the pleasantness and harmony they were to enjoy in  after life. Recourse was had to augury, the day before the wedding, to  ascertain whether the married life was to be prosperous. Before the  bride retired for the night, she was bathed with water drawn from nine  different springs. The time of the year the Grecians deemed most lucky  for marriage was the first month of winter. This was contrary to the  views of the Persians, who considered spring the proper season for  entering into the matrimonial state. The Greeks thought it better to  get married in the first or second quarter of the moon rather than  when it was waning. General rules were at times departed from, for  occasionally astrologers were consulted as to the most auspicious day  and hour for the happy lovers being united.    Through magical influence, a husband could have been made to hate his  wife; but, to regain his affections, a spider caught in early morn was  confined in a box, protected by charms, prepared for its reception.  When a child came into the world, three men kept watch all night to  keep away evil spirits. One of those on guard was armed with an axe,  another with a pestle, and the third with a broom. Each protector kept  his implement swinging through the air, to prevent the approach of the  dreaded beings. As soon as a child was born it was washed in water or  wine, and wrapped in a cloth worn by the mother when she was a virgin.  In the cloth were wrought the image of the Gorgon and the snakes of  that monster's head, together with the likenesses of two dragons. When  the child was five days old, it was carried about the hearth to  introduce it to the Penates. Arrangements were then made for naming  the child. A feast was prepared, at which there were doves, thrushes,  coleworts, and toasted cheese, besides many other things. The feast  was kept up for seven days. The mother, in gratitude for her child,  sacrificed to Diana, and the father returned thanks to the nymphs for  giving him a fruitful wife.    If the little stranger died in infancy, it had only a cold funeral  without fire, or any burial service or mourning. Sons, as soon as they  were three years old, were registered in the tribe. A feast was then  prepared, called \"the shearing feast,\" because at that time the  youngster's hair was cut, and consecrated to one of their gods.    The Athenians had a law, that if any one happened to discover a dead  body, whether of a friend or a stranger, he should cast earth on it  three times; and the Romans had a similar law. If a Greek omitted this  duty, he was bound to make satisfaction by sacrificing a sow-pig. But  some went farther, and insisted that whoever saw a dead body and did  not cast dust upon it, was both a law-breaker and an accursed person.  The people feared that the gods underground were angry if the dead  were left uncovered with their kindred dust. No greater imprecation  could have been cast at an enemy than that he might not be covered  with the earth. Hence it was that the ancients stood in great fear of  death on the ocean, for there their bodies could not be interred. When  one went to sea, it was not uncommon for him to tie a reward to his  body, that in case he should be drowned and his body found, the finder  would see it buried, and so become entitled to the treasure. Next to  the happiness of being assured that the body would be buried, was that  of being interred in one's own country, and not among strangers.
