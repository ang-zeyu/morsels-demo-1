Go and knock at his door.  Tell him to come at once.\"    \"Excuse me, Josiah,\" said Mrs Lavington excitedly; \"let me go.\"    Uncle Josiah grunted his consent, and Mrs Lavington hurried out into  the hall, and then upstairs.    \"Slipped in while you were half asleep,\" said the old man to Jessie.    \"No, sir, indeed.  I've been watching carefully all night.\"    \"Humph!  There's half a crown for you to buy a hat ribbon, Jessie.  Well,\" he continued as his sister entered hastily, \"what does he say?\"    \"Josiah!\" cried the trembling woman, \"what does this mean?  Don was out  when I went up yesterday evening, and he has not been to his room all  night.\"    \"What?\"    \"Neither has Kitty been to hers.\"    Uncle Josiah thrust back his chair, and left his half-eaten breakfast.    \"Look here,\" he exclaimed in a hoarse voice; \"what nonsense is this?\"    \"No nonsense, Josiah,\" cried Mrs Lavington.  \"I felt a presentiment.\"    \"Felt a stuff and nonsense!\" he said angrily.  \"Kitty not in her room?  Kitty not been to bed?  Here, Jessie!\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You did go to sleep, didn't you?\"    \"Ye-e-e-s, sir!\"    \"I thought as much, and,\"--here tut-tut-tut--\"that would not explain it.  Hullo, what do you want?\"    This was to the cook, who tapped, opened the door, and then held up her  hand as if to command silence.    \"Please, 'm, would you mind coming here?\" she said softly.  Mrs  Lavington ran to the door, followed the woman across the hall, unaware  of the fact that the old merchant was close at her heels.    They paused as soon as they were inside the drawing-room, impressed by  the scene before them, for there, half sitting, half lying, and fast  asleep, with the tears on her cheeks still wet, as if she had wept as  she lay there unconscious, was Kitty, for the bricks on the opposite  wall had been too indistinct for her to see.    \"Don't wake her,\" said Uncle Josiah softly, and he signed to them to go  back into the hall, where he turned to Jessie.    \"Did you see Miss Kitty last night?\"    \"Ye-es, sir.\"    \"Where?\"    \"She comed into the kitchen, sir.\"    \"After we had gone to bed?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And you said nothing just now?\"    \"No, sir, I didn't like to.\"    \"That will do.  Be off,\" said the old man sternly.  \"Laura.  Here!\"    Mrs Lavington followed her brother back into the dining-room.    \"The poor child must have been sitting up to watch for Lindon's return.\"    \"And he has not returned, Josiah,\" sobbed Mrs Lavington.    \"Here, stop!  What are you going to do?\"    \"I am going up to his room to see,\" said the sobbing woman.    Uncle Josiah made no opposition, for he read the mother's thought, and  followed her upstairs, where a half-open drawer told tales, and in a few  moments Mrs Lavington had satisfied herself.    \"I cannot say exactly,\" she said piteously; \"but he has made up a bundle  of his things.\"    \"The coward!\" cried Uncle Josiah fiercely.    \"Gone!  Gone!  My poor boy!\"    \"Hush!\" cried the old man sternly.  \"He has sneaked off like a  contemptible cur.  No, I will not believe it of him,\" he added  impetuously.  \"Lindon has too much stuff in him to play such a  despicable part.  You are wrong, Laura.  Come down and finish breakfast.  I will not believe it of the boy.\"    \"But he has gone, Josiah, he has gone,\" sobbed his sister.    \"Then if he has, it is the yielding to a sudden impulse, and as soon as  he comes to his senses he will return.  Lindon will not be such a  coward, Laura.  Mark my words.\"    \"You are saying this to comfort me,\" said Mrs Lavington sadly.    \"I am saying what I think,\" cried her brother.  \"If I thought he had  gone right off, I would say so, but I do not think anything of the kind.  He may have thought of doing so last night, but this morning he will  repent and come back.\"    He took his sister's hand gently, and led her downstairs, making her  resume her place at the table, and taking his own again, as he made a  pretence of going on with his breakfast; but before he had eaten his  second mouthful there was a dull heavy thump at the front door.    \"There!\" cried the old man; \"what did I say?  Here he is.\"    Before the front door could be opened, Kitty, who had been awakened by  the knock, came in looking scared and strange.    \"Don,\" she said; \"I have been asleep.  Has he come back?\"    \"Yes I think this is he,\" said the old man gently.  \"Come here, my pet;  don't shrink like that.  I'm not angry.\"    \"If you please, sir,\" said Jessie, \"here's a woman from the yard.\"    \"Mrs Wimble?\"    \"Yes, sir; and can she speak to you a minute?\"    \"Yes, I'll come--no, show her in here.  News.  An ambassador, Laura,\"  said the old man with a grim smile, as Jessie went out.  \"There, Kitty,  my dear, don't cry.  It will be all right soon.\"    At that moment little Mrs Wimble entered, white cheeked, red-eyed, limp  and miserable looking, the very opposite of the trim little Sally who  lorded it over her patient husband.    \"Mrs Wimble!\" cried Mrs Lavington, catching the little woman's arm  excitedly; \"you have brought some news about my son.\"    \"No,\" moaned Sally, with a passionate burst of sobs.  \"Went out  tea-time, and never come back all night.\"    \"Yes, yes, we know that,\" said Uncle Josiah sternly; \"but how did you  know?\"    \"Know, sir?  I've been sitting up for him all this dreadful night.\"    \"What, for my nephew?\"    \"No, sir, for my Jem.\"    \"Lindon--James Wimble!\" said Uncle Josiah, as he sank back in his seat.  \"Impossible!  It can't be true.\"        CHAPTER TEN.    GONE!    \"Speak, woman!\" cried Mrs Lavington hoarsely; and she shook little  Sally by the arm.  \"What do you mean?\"    \"I don't know, ma'am.  I'm in such trouble,\" sobbed Sally.  \"I've been a  very, very wicked girl--I mean woman.  I was always finding fault, and  scolding him.\"    \"Why?\" asked Uncle Josiah sternly.    \"I don't know, sir.\"    \"But he is a quiet industrious man, and I'm sure he is a good husband.\"    \"Yes, he's the best of husbands,\" sobbed Sally.    \"Then why did you scold him?\"    \"Because I was so wicked, I suppose.  I couldn't help it, sir.\"    \"But you think he has run away?\"    \"Yes, sir; I'm sure of it.  He said he would some day if I was so cruel,  and that seemed to make me more cruel, and--and--he has gone.\"    \"It is impossible!\" said Uncle Josiah.  \"He must have met with some  accident.\"    \"No, sir, he has run away and left me.  He said he would.  I saw him  go--out of the window, and he took a bundle with him, and--and--what  shall I do?  What shall I do?\"    \"Took a bundle?\" said Uncle Josiah, starting.    \"Yes, sir, and--and I wish I was dead.\"    \"Silence, you foolish little woman!  How dare you wish such a thing?  Stop; listen to what I say.  Did my nephew Lindon come to the yard last  night?\"    \"No, sir; but him and my Jem were talking together for ever so long in  the office, and I couldn't get Jem away.\"    Uncle Josiah gave vent to a low whistle.    \"Please ask Master Don what my Jem said.\"    \"Do you not understand, my good woman, that my son has not been home all  night?\" said Mrs Lavington, piteously.    \"What?  Not been home?\" cried Sally, sharply.  \"Then they're gone off  together.\"    Uncle Josiah drew a long breath.    \"That Master Don was always talking to my poor Jem, and he has persuaded  him, and they're gone.\"    \"It is not true!\" cried Kitty in a sharp voice as she stood by the  table, quivering with anger.  \"If Cousin Don has gone away, it is your  wicked husband who has persuaded him.  Father, dear, don't let them go;  pray, pray fetch them back.\"    Uncle Josiah's brow grew more rugged, and there were hard lines about  his lips, till his sister laid her hand upon his arm, when he started,  and took her hand, looking sadly down in her face.    \"You hear what Kitty says,\" whispered Mrs Lavington; \"pray--pray fetch  them back.\"    Little Mrs Wimble heard her words, and gave the old merchant an  imploring look.    But the old man's face only grew more hard.    \"I am afraid it must be true,\" he said.  \"Foolish boy!  Woman, your  husband has behaved like an idiot.\"    \"But you will send and fetch them back, Josiah.\"    \"Don't talk nonsense, Laura,\" said the old man angrily.  \"How can I  fetch them back?  Foolish boy!  At a time like this.  Is he afraid to  face the truth?\"    \"No, no, Josiah,\" cried Mrs Lavington; \"it is only that he was hurt.\"    \"Hurt?  He has hurt himself.  That man will be before the magistrates  to-day, and I passed my word to the constable that Lindon should be  present to answer the charge made against him.\"    \"Yes, dear, and he has been thoughtless.  But you will forgive him, and  have him brought back.\"    \"Have him brought back!\" cried Uncle Josiah fiercely.  \"What can I do?  The law will have him brought back now.\"    \"What?  Oh, brother, don't say that!\"    \"I must tell you the truth,\" said Uncle Josiah sternly.  \"It is the same  as breaking faith, and he has given strength to that scoundrel's  charge.\"    \"But what shall I do?\" sobbed little Sally Wimble.  \"My Jem hadn't done  anything.  Oh, please, sir, fetch him back.\"    \"Your husband has taken his own road, my good woman,\" said Uncle Josiah  coldly, \"and he must suffer for it.\"    \"But what's to become of me, sir?  What shall I do without a husband?\"    \"Go back home and wait.\"    \"But I have no home, sir, now,\" sobbed Sally.  \"You'll want the cottage  for some other man.\"    \"Go back home and wait.\"    \"But you'll try and fetch him back, sir?\"    \"I don't know what I shall do yet,\" said the old man sternly.  \"I'm  afraid I do not know the worst.  There, go away now.  Who's that?\"    There was a general excitement, for a loud knock was heard at the door.    Jessie came in directly after,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21324"],[0,"Recollections of Old Liverpool (#11)"],[1,"the  landscape, and certainly looked very pretty.  It was a great shame that  persons should have been permitted to carry away the stones for building  or any other purpose.  Had not a stop at last been put to this sort of  work there would not in time have been a vestige of the old Abbey left.  I recollect that there was a belief that a tunnel or subterraneous  passage ran under the Mersey to Liverpool from the Priory, and that the  entrance in 1818, when the church was built, had been found and a good  way traversed.  That passage was commonly spoken of as being in existence  when I was a boy, and I often vowed I would try to find it.  I have been  up the tunnels or caves at the Red and White Noses many a time for great  distances.  I was once fishing for codling at the Perch, and with two  young companions went up the caves for at least a mile, and could have  gone further only we became frightened as our lights went out.  It was  thought these caves ran up to Chester Cathedral--but that was all stuff.  I believe they were excavated by smugglers in part, and partly natural  cavities of the earth.  We knew little then of archaeology or geology, or  any other \"ology,\" or I might be able to tell a good deal about these  caves, for I saw them more than once, but I now forget what their size  and height was.  The floor, I recollect, was very uneven and strewed  about with big stones, while the roof was arched over in the red  sand-stone.  The encroachment of the sea upon the Wirral shore has been  very gradual, but regular, for many years.  Within the memory of man the  sea has made an inroad of nearly, if not quite, a mile from its former  high-water mark.  It was not until the erection of the Wallasey  embankment that a stop was put to its ravages.    When I stand on the Pier-head, or take my daily walk on the  Landing-Stage, I often pause and revolve in my mind the wonderful changes  that have taken place in my time in this native town of mine.  The other  day, soon after the completion of the large Landing-Stage, I sat down and  thought would any man then making use of the old baths, swimming inside  the palisade, have not considered me, some eighty years ago, a mad fool  to have predicted that before I died I should sit on a long floating  stage two or three hundred yards from where we were swimming, that would  be about a quarter of a mile in length, and that between it and the shore  there would be most wonderful docks built, in which the ships of all  nations would display their colours, and discharge their precious  freights?  As I sat there the other day, I thought of the one bath and  the old houses by the river's brink, and the Bath-street, along which  came, in the summer-time, such strings of country \"dowkers.\"  Beyond the  baths there were no houses, all was open shore consisting of boulder  stones, sand, and pools, such as may be seen on any sea-beach.  There was  hot as well as cold water bathing in the baths, and a palisade ran out  into the river, within which, at high-water, persons could swim, as in a  plunge-bath.  These baths were erected originally by Mr. Wright, who sold  them to the corporation in 1774, by which body they were enlarged and  greatly improved.    I recollect the bath-woman sold a sort of parliament cake, covered over  with coloured sugar plums, and also some sweet things which in appearance  resembled slugs.  I never see these caraway-cakes and confections in the  low shops in which they are now only sold, without thinking of the fat  old bath-woman, who was a terror to me and others of my size and age.  In  1816 these baths were discontinued and pulled down on the opening of  George's Pier-head baths.  For a mile or more there was good bathing on  the shore.  The bathing machines were introduced about the end of the  last century.  The keeper of the \"Wishing Gate-house\" had several, and an  old man who lived in a low hut near the mill (the remains of which still  stand in the Waterloo-road) had two or three, and made money by them.  At  that time Bootle and Bootle Marshes were wild places, the roads  execrable, and as for frogs (Bootle organs), the noise they made at night  was wonderful.  I recollect all the docks and streets from Bath-street  downwards being sand-hills and salt-marshes.  New Quay, of which  Bath-street was a continuation, was a sort of haven, into which small  vessels, at certain times of the tide, ran to discharge their cargoes.  On the tide receding the vessels were left high and dry upon the bank.  Bathers used to be seen in any number on the shore.  Decency was so  frequently outraged that the authorities were at last compelled to take  steps to redress the grievance.  Not far from the baths was once a  pleasant public walk of which I have often heard my father and mother  speak.  It was called the \"Ladies Walk,\" and extended from the site of  the present Canal bridge by Old Hall-street, down to the river.  It was a  sort of a terraced gravel walk, having four rows of fine Lombardy  poplars, and seats underneath.  On fine evenings all the gay and  fashionable world of Liverpool used to take the air and show off their  hoops and high heels, and the gentlemen their brocaded silk coats, and  three-cornered hats.  The sword was often drawn by the gallants for some  fancied affront, and occasionally a little blood was spilt, a matter of  no moment in those days.  Great was the grief when it was announced that  the Leeds and Liverpool Canal Company had resolved on the destruction of  the Ladies Walk.    There was another Ladies Walk in Duke-street, which extended from  opposite the present York-street (then called Great George-street) to  Berry-street.  This was afterwards converted into a ropery and succeeded  by Parr-street.  By the way, Duke-street, which occupies a portion of its  site, has been famous for notable persons residing in it.  In the third  house from Colquitt-street Felicia Hemans was born, and she wrote some of  her early poetry there.  In the yard of the next house was once a tree,  the last remnant of the Ladies Walk, which had two rows of trees down the  sides and centre as in the other Ladies Walk previously mentioned.  Mrs.  Hemans apostrophizes this tree in one of her early poems.  I recollect  her very well, for she was intimate with my friends, the Nicholsons, who  lived at the top of Richmond-row some forty years ago.  Miss Browne  received much advice and encouragement from Mr. Nicholson, and she was a  most pleasing person.  As Mrs. Hemans, her life was not happy.  She  resided at one time at Wavertree, in one of those cottages on the left  hand side of the road just beyond Orford-street.  The present  \"Loggerheads Tavern Revived\" was Mr. Nicholson's house.  It was a  public-house, called \"The Loggerheads\" before he converted it into a  private dwelling.  Where Soho-street now begins there was a dyer's pond  and yard; over it was a fine weeping-willow.  In Duke-street also lodged  at one time Thomas Campbell, the poet.  He occupied part of the house now  converted into a cabinet-maker's shop by Messrs. Abbot.  I visited Mr.  Campbell several times when he was preparing \"The Pleasures of Hope\" for  publication.  He was a very handsome young man, with a fine face and  bright eyes.  Mr. John Howard lodged in Duke-street in the house directly  facing Cornwallis-street, then newly built.  At this time his \"Report on  Prisons\" was passing through the Warrington Press; and he used to journey  backwards and forwards to correct the proofs.  The Rev. Gilbert Wakefield  lodged in Duke-street, near the bottom, when he was first appointed  curate to St. Paul's church, then just erected.  Dr. Henderson was the  first incumbent of that church.  Strangely enough, he seceded from the  Dissenting body, while Mr. Wakefield joined it from the Church.  Curious  stories were told of Dr. Henderson's ministration.  Mr. Wakefield  complained bitterly of the unkindness and inhospitality of the Liverpool  clergy.  He said he never was invited but by one brother clergyman to  visit him during his stay in Liverpool.    In 1812, Bellingham, who shot Mr. Percival in the House of Commons, on  the 11th of May, also lived in Duke-street, about the sixth house above  Slater-street.  His wife was a dressmaker and milliner.  She was a very  nice person, and after Bellingham's execution the ladies of Liverpool  raised a subscription for, and greatly patronized her.  Bellingham was  born at St. Neot's, in Huntingdonshire, about 1771.  His father was a  land-surveyor and miniature-painter.  Becoming insane, he was for some  time confined in St. Luke's Hospital, London; but being found incurable  he was taken home, where he died soon afterwards.  Bellingham, at the age  of fourteen, was apprenticed to a jeweller in Whitechapel, named Love,  from whom, after giving much trouble and annoyance, he ran away.  In 1786  his mother's sister's husband, a Mr. Daw, yielding to the solicitations  of his wife and Mrs. Bellingham, fitted the young man out for India,  whither he sailed in the ship _Hartwell_, in the Company's service.  This  vessel was wrecked off one of the Cape de Verd Islands, and young  Bellingham managed to get home again, penniless--having lost everything  he possessed.  Still influenced by his female relatives, Mr. Daw next  took a shop in the tinware trade for Bellingham.  This shop was in  Oxford-street; but a fire occurring in it, Bellingham asserted that he  had a large number of bank-notes destroyed.  It was suspected he was  cognizant of the origin of this fire; but nothing could be proved against  him.  In 1794 he became bankrupt; but his creditors were so disgusted  with the statement of his affairs, that they would not grant him his  certificate, and he never obtained it.  We next find him obtaining  employment in a merchant's counting-house; and after being with them some  time he was sent out by them to Archangel.  He remained there about"]]]
