A young man who has a  pure and genuine respect for ladies, will not only make a good husband, but  a good citizen as well.    11. MASCULINE ATTENTION.--No woman is entitled to any more attention than  her loveliness and ladylike conduct will command. Those who are most  pleasing will receive the most attention, and those who desire more should  aspire to acquire more by cultivating those graces and virtues which  ennoble woman, but no lady should lower or distort her own true ideal, or  smother and crucify her conscience, in order to please any living man. A  good man will admire a good woman, and deceptions cannot long be concealed.  Her show of dry goods or glitter of jewels cannot long cover up her  imperfections or deceptions.    12. PURITY.--Purity of purpose will solve all social problems. Let all  stand on this exalted sexual platform, and teach every man just how to  treat the female sex, and every woman how to behave towards the masculine;  and it will incomparably adorn the manners of both, make both happy in each  other, and mutually develop each other's sexuality and humanity.    [Illustration]    {63}    Practical Rules on Table Manners.    [Illustration]    1. Help ladies with a due appreciation; do not overload the plate of any  person you serve. Never pour gravy on a plate without permission. It spoils  the meat for some persons.    2. Never put anything by force upon any one's plate. It is extremely  ill-bred, though extremely common, to press one to eat of anything.    3. If at dinner you are requested to help any one to sauce or gravy, do not  pour it over the meat or vegetables, but on one side of them. Never load  down a person's plate with anything.    4. As soon as you are helped, begin to eat, or at least begin to occupy  yourself with what you have before you. Do not wait till your neighbors are  served--a custom that was long ago abandoned.    5. Should you, however, find yourself at a table where they have the  old-fashioned steel forks, eat with your knife, as the others do, and do  not let it be seen that you have any objection to doing so.    6. Bread should be broken. To butter a large piece of bread and then bite  it, as children do, is something the knowing never do. {64}    7. In eating game or poultry do not touch the bones with your fingers. To  take a bone in the fingers for the purpose of picking it, is looked upon as  being very inelegant.    8. Never use your own knife or fork to help another. Use rather the knife  or fork of the person you help.    9. Never send your knife or fork, or either of them, on your plate when you  send for second supply.    10. Never turn your elbows out when you use your knife and fork. Keep them  close to your sides.    11. Whenever you use your fingers to convey anything to your mouth or to  remove anything from the mouth, let it be the fingers of the left hand.    12. Tea, coffee, chocolate and the like are drank from the cup and never  from the saucer.    13. In masticating your food, keep your mouth shut; otherwise you will make  a noise that will be very offensive to those around you.    14. Don't attempt to talk with a full mouth. One thing at a time is as much  as any man can do well.    15. Should you find a worm or insect in your food, say nothing about it.    16. If a dish is distasteful to you, decline it, and without comment.    17. Never put bones or bits of fruit on the table cloth. Put them on the  side of your plate.    18. Do not hesitate to take the last piece on the dish, simply because it  is the last. To do so is to directly express the fear that you would  exhaust the supply.    19. If you would be what you would like to be--abroad, take care that you  _are_ what you would like to be--at home.    20. Avoid picking your teeth at the table if possible; but if you must, do  it, if you can, where you are not observed.    21. If an accident of any kind soever should occur during dinner, the cause  being who or what it may, you should not seem to note it.    22. Should you be so unfortunate as to overturn or to break anything, you  should make no apology. You might let your regret appear in your face, but  it would not be proper to put it in words.           *       *       *       *       *      {65}    Social Duties.      Man in Society is like a flower,    Blown in its native bed. 'Tis there alone    His faculties expanded in full bloom    Shine out, there only reach their proper use.--COWPER.      The primal duties shine aloft like stars;    The charities that soothe, and heal, and bless,    Are scatter'd at the feet of man like flowers.--WORDSWORTH.           *       *       *       *       *    {66}    [Illustration: GIVING A PARLOR RECITATION.]    1. MEMBERSHIP IN SOCIETY.--Many fail to get hold of the idea that they are  members of society. They seem to suppose that the social machinery of the  world is self-operating. They cast their first ballot with an emotion of  pride, perhaps, but are sure to pay their first tax with a groan. They see  political organizations in active existence; the parish, and the church,  and other important bodies that embrace in some form of society all men,  are successfully operated; and yet these young men have no part or lot in  the matter. They do not think of giving a day's time to society.    2. BEGIN EARLY.--One of the first things a young man should do is to see  that he is acting his part in society. The earlier this is begun the  better. I think that the opponents of secret societies in colleges have  failed to estimate the benefit which it must be to every member to be  obliged to contribute to the support of his particular organization, and to  assume personal care and responsibility as a member. If these societies  have a tendency to teach the lessons of which I speak, they are a blessed  thing.    3. DO YOUR PART.--Do your part, and be a man among men. Assume your portion  of social responsibility, and see that you discharge it well. If you do not  do this, then you are mean, and society has the right to despise you just  as much as it chooses to do so. You are, to use a word more emphatic than  agreeable, a sneak, and have not a claim upon your neighbors for a single  polite word.    4. A WHINING COMPLAINER.--Society, as it is called, is far more apt to pay  its dues to the individual than the individual to society. Have you, young  man, who are at home whining over the fact that you cannot get into  society, done anything to give you a claim to social recognition? Are you  able to make any return for social recognition and social privileges? Do  you know anything? What kind of coin do you propose to pay in the discharge  of the obligation which comes upon you with social recognition? In other  words, as a return for what you wish to have society do for you, what can  you do for society? This is a very important question--more important to  you than to society. The question is, whether you will be a member of  society by right, or by courtesy. If you have so mean a spirit as to be  content to be a beneficiary of society--to receive favors and to confer  none--you have no business in the society to which you aspire. You are an  exacting, conceited fellow.    5. WHAT ARE YOU GOOD FOR?--Are you a good beau, and are you willing to make  yourself useful in waiting on the {67} ladies on all occasions? Have you a  good set of teeth, which you are willing to show whenever the wit of the  company gets off a good thing? Are you a true, straightforward, manly  fellow, with whose healthful and uncorrupted nature it is good for society  to come in contact? In short, do you possess anything of any social value?  If you do, and are willing to impart it, society will yield itself to your  touch. If you have nothing, then society, as such, owes you nothing.  Christian philanthropy may put its arm around you, as a lonely young man,  about to spoil for want of something, but it is very sad and humiliating  for a young man to be brought to that. There are people who devote  themselves to nursing young men, and doing them good. If they invite you to  tea, go by all means, and try your hand. If, in the course of the evening,  you can prove to them that your society is desirable, you have won a point.  Don't be patronized.    6. THE MORBID CONDITION.--Young men, you are apt to get into a morbid state  of mind, which declines them to social intercourse. They become devoted to  business with such exclusiveness, that all social intercourse is irksome.  They go out to tea as if they were going to jail, and drag themselves to a  party as to an execution. This disposition is thoroughly morbid, and to be  overcome by going where you are invited, always, and with a sacrifice of  feeling.    7. THE COMMON BLUNDER.--Don't shrink from contact with anything but bad  morals. Men who affect your unhealthy minds with antipathy, will prove  themselves very frequently to be your best friends and most delightful  companions. Because a man seems uncongenial to you, who are squeamish and  foolish, you have no right to shun him. We become charitable by knowing  men. We learn to love those whom we have despised by rubbing against them.  Do you not remember some instance of meeting a man or woman whom you had  never previously known or cared to know--an individual, perhaps, against  whom you have entertained the strongest prejudices--but to whom you became  bound by a lifelong friendship through the influence of a three days'  intercourse? Yet, if you had not thus met, you would have carried through  life the idea that it would be impossible for you to give your fellowship  to such an individual.    8. THE FOOLISHNESS OF MAN.--God has introduced into human character  infinite variety, and for you to say that you do not love and will not  associate with a man because he is unlike you, is not only foolish but  wrong. You are to remember that in the precise manner and decree in which  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23624"],[0,"Ride Proud, Rebel! (#11)"],[1," militia. They were as wide-eyed in their return stare as the  civilians on the streets around.    Kirby chuckled. \"Strut it up, roosters,\" he urged from the corner of his  mouth. \"Cutthroats, banditti, hoss thieves--jus' downright bad hombres,  that's us. They expect us to be on the peck, all horns an' rattles.  Don't disappoint 'em none! Their tails is half curled up already, an'  they're ready to run if a horny toad yells Boo!\"    To the outward eye the three riding leisurely down the middle of the  Bardstown street had no interest in the soldiers by the trough. Drew in  the middle, the white rag dropping from the barrel of his carbine,  brought the black a step or two in advance. Just so had Castleman ridden  into Lexington earlier, and that had been at night with a far more wary  and dangerous enemy to face. The scout's confidence rose as he watched,  without making any show of his surveillance, the uneasy men ahead.    One of them broke away from the group, and ran into the inn.    \"Wonder who's roddin' this outfit,\" Kirby remarked. \"That fella's gone  to rout him out. Do your talkin' like a short-trigger man, Drew.\"    They pulled rein in front of the inn and sat their horses facing the  door through which the soldier had disappeared. His fellows edged  around the trough and stood in a straggling line to front the  Confederates.    \"You!\" Drew caught the eye of the nearest. \"Tell your commanding officer  General Morgan's flag is here!\"    The Yankee was young, almost as young as Boyd, but he had less assurance  than Boyd. Now the boy stammered a little as he answered:    \"Yes ... yes, sir.\" Then he added in a rush, \"General who, sir?\"    \"General John Hunt Morgan, Confederate Cavalry, Army of the Tennessee,  detached duty!\" Drew made that as impressive as he could, whether it was  worded correctly according to military protocol or not. It was, he  thought with satisfaction, a nicely rounded, important-sounding speech,  although a bit short.    \"Yes, sir!\" The boy started for the door, but he was too late.    The man who erupted from that portal was short and stout, his face a  dramatic scarlet above the dark blue of his unbuttoned coat. He stopped  short a step or two into the open and stood staring at the three on  horseback, that scarlet growing more dusky by the second.    \"Who ... are ... you?\" His demand was expelled in heavy puffs of breath.    \"Flag from General Morgan,\" Drew repeated. Then to make it quite plain,  he added kindly, \"General John Hunt Morgan, Confederate Cavalry, Army of  the Tennessee, detached duty.\"    \"But, but Morgan was defeated ... at Cynthiana. He was broken--\"    Slowly Drew shook his head. \"The General has been reported defeated  before, suh. No, he's right here outside Bardstown. And I wouldn't  rightly say he was broken either, not with a couple of regiments behind  him--\"    \"Couple of regiments!\" The man was buttoning his coat, his red jowls  sagging a little, almost as if Drew had used the carbine across his  unprotected head. \"Couple of regiments ... Morgan ...\" he repeated  dazedly. \"Well,\" sullenly he spoke to Drew, \"what does he want?\"    \"You're a captain,\" Drew spoke crisply. \"You'll return with us to  discuss surrender terms with an officer of equal rank!\"    \"Surrender!\" For a moment some of the sag went out of the other.    \"Two regiments--an' you have maybe eighty or ninety men.\" Kirby gazed  with critical disparagement at such Union forces as were visible.    \"One hundred and twenty-five,\" the officer repeated mechanically and  then glared at the Texan.    \"One hundred and twenty-five then.\" Kirby was willing to be generous.  \"All ready to hold this heah town. I don't see no artillery neither.\" He  rose in his stirrups to view the immediate scene. \"Goin' to fight from  house to house maybe--?\"    \"General Morgan,\" Drew remarked to the company at large, \"is not a  patient man. But it's your decision, suh. If you want to make a fight of  it.\" He shrugged.    \"No! Well, I'll talk ... listen to your terms anyway. Get my horse!\" he  roared at the nearest soldier.    They escorted the captain with due solemnity out of Bardstown to meet  Campbell, a well-armed guard in evidence strung out on the pike. The  Union officer picked up enough assurance to demand to see the General  himself, but Campbell's show of surprised hauteur at the request was an  expert's weapon in rebuttal; and the other not only subsided but agreed  without undue protest to Campbell's statement of terms.    The Union detachment in town were to stack their arms in the square,  leaving in addition their rations. They were to withdraw, unarmed, to a  field outside and there await the patroling officer who would visit them  in due course. Having agreed, the Union captain departed.    Campbell was already signaling the rest of the company out of cover.    \"This is where we move fast. You all know what to do.\"    But much had to be left to chance. Drew and Kirby surrendered their  borrowed carbines to the rightful owners and prepared to join the first  wave of that quick dash.    _\"Yahhhh-aww-wha--\"_ There were no words in that, just the war cry which  might have torn from an Indian warrior's throat, but which came instead  from between Kirby's lips: the famous Yell with all its yip of victory  as only an uninhibited Texan could deliver it. Then they were rushing,  yelping in an answering chorus, four and five abreast, down the street  under the shade of the trees, answered by screams and cries as the walks  emptied before them.    Blue ranks broke up ahead, leaving rifles stacked, provisions in  knapsacks. And the ragged crew struck at the spoil like a wave, lapping  up arms, cartridge boxes, knapsacks. For only moments there was a  milling pandemonium in the heart of Bardstown. Then once again that Yell  was raised, echoed, and the pound of hoofs made an artillery barrage of  sound. Armed, provisioned, and very much the masters of the scene,  Morgan's men were heading out of town on the other side, leaving  bewilderment behind.    They pushed the pace, knowing that the telegraph wires or the couriers  would be spreading the news. Perhaps the reputation of their commander  might slow the inevitable pursuit, but it would not deter it entirely.  They must put as much distance between themselves and the out-foxed  Union garrison as they could. And Campbell continued to point them  westward instead of south, since any enemy force would be marching in  the other direction to cut them off.    Even if men could stand that dogged pace, driven by determination and  fear of capture, horses could not. And through the next two days the  inference was very clear: fall behind at your own risk; there will be no  waiting for laggards to catch up. Nor any mounts furnished; you must  provide your own.    Drew discovered the black gelding an increasing problem, but at least  the horse provided transportation, and he tried to save the animal as  best he could. Though when it was impossible to unsaddle, when one had  to ride--and did--some twenty hours out of twenty-four, there was not  much the most experienced horseman could do to relieve his mount.    Drew pulled up beside Kirby as he returned from a flank scout. The Texan  had dropped to the rear of the small troop, holding his horse to not  much more than a walk. Now and then he glanced to the receding length of  the road as if in search of someone.    \"Where's Boyd?\" Drew had ridden along the full length of the company and  nowhere had he seen that blond head.    \"Jus' what I'm wonderin'.\" Kirby came to a complete halt. \"I came back  a little while ago, and nobody's seen him.\"    Drew pulled in beside the other. His horse's head hung low as the  gelding blew in gusty snorts. He tried to remember when he had seen Boyd  last and when he did, that memory was not too encouraging.    \"With Hilders ... and Cambridge ...\" he said softly.    \"Yeah.\" Kirby's thought seemed to match his. \"Hilder's mare is jus'  about beat, an' Boyd rides light; that bay he got is holdin' up like a  corn-fed stud.\"    \"They were talkin' to him when I went out on point.\" Drew followed his  own line of thought. \"And he won't listen to me--\"    \"It don't foller that because you advise a hombre for his own good, he's  goin' to take kindly to your interest in him,\" the Texan observed. \"You  tell him Hilders an' Cambridge are wearin' skunk stripes, an' he's apt  to claim 'em both as compadres. Suppose he don't come in when we bed  down; he coulda jus' cut his picket rope an' drifted, as far as we can  prove.\"    \"Not if his bay turns up with one of them on top,\" Drew replied.    \"Them two are of the curly wolf breed.\" Kirby shifted his newly acquired  Enfield. \"No tellin' as how they would join up with us again did they  make such a switch; might figure as how they could make it better time  driftin' on their own.\"    The Texan had put his own fear into words. Drew pointed the gelding back  down the road and booted the animal into a trot. A moment later he heard  more drumming hoofs behind him; Kirby was following.    \"This ain't your trouble,\" Drew reminded him.    \"No, maybe it ain't. But then, me, I'm jus' a rough string rider from  way back, an' this may end in a smoke-up. Odds seem a mite one-sided  now--Hilders is easy on the trigger. He won't take kindly to anyone  tryin' to hang up his hide for dryin'--\"    Drew studied the hoof-churned dust of the road. He could only hold a  very slim hope of some trace along its margin. The gelding stumbled and  tried to cut pace. Drew hardened his will, holding the animal to the  trot. He knew that under saddle and blanket, sores were forming, that  soon he would have no choice but a \"trade\" such as Hilders might be  forcing now, though not at the expense of one of his own fellows.    Kirby was reading sign on the other side of the road. His sudden hand  signal brought Drew to join him. Hoofprints marked the softer verge.    \"Turned off not too long "]]]
