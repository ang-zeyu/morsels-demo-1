Know your  own world first--not denying any other, but being quite sure that the  place in which you are now put is the place with which you are now  concerned; and that it will be wiser in you to think the gods  themselves may appear in the form of a dove, or a swallow, than that,  by false theft from the form of dove or swallow, you can represent the  aspect of gods.    79. One sweet instance of such simple conception, in the end of the  Odyssey, must surely recur to your minds in connection with our subject  of to-day, but you may not have noticed the recurrent manner in which  Homer insists on the thought. When Ulysses first bends and strings his  bow, the vibration of the chord is shrill, \"like the note of a  swallow.\" A poor and unwarlike simile, it seems! But in the next book,  when Ulysses stands with his bow lifted, and Telemachus has brought the  lances, and laid them at his feet, and Athena comes to his side to  encourage him,--do you recollect the gist of her speech? \"You fought,\"  she says, \"nine years for the sake of Helen, and for another's  house:--now, returned, after all those wanderings, and under your own  roof, for it, and its treasures, will you not fight, then?\" And she  herself flies up to the house-roof, and thence, _in the form of the  swallow_, guides the arrows of vengeance for the violation of the  sanctities of home.    80. To-day, then, I believe verily for the first time, I have been able  to put before you some means of guidance to understand the beauty of  the bird which lives with you in your own houses, and which purifies  for you, from its insect pestilence, the air that you breathe. Thus the  sweet domestic thing has done, for men, at least these four thousand  years. She has been their companion, not of the home merely, but of the  hearth, and the threshold; companion only endeared by departure, and  showing better her loving-kindness by her faithful return. Type  sometimes of the stranger, she has softened us to hospitality; type  always of the suppliant, she has enchanted us to mercy; and in her  feeble presence, the cowardice, or the wrath, of sacrilege has changed  into the fidelities of sanctuary. Herald of our summer, she glances  through our days of gladness; numberer of our years, she would teach us  to apply our hearts to wisdom;--and yet, so little have we regarded  her, that this very day, scarcely able to gather from all I can find  told of her enough to explain so much as the unfolding of her wings, I  can tell you nothing of her life--nothing of her journeying: I cannot  learn how she builds, nor how she chooses the place of her wandering,  nor how she traces the path of her return. Remaining thus blind and  careless to the true ministries of the humble creature whom God has  really sent to serve us, we in our pride, thinking ourselves surrounded  by the pursuivants of the sky, can yet only invest them with majesty by  giving them the calm of the bird's motion, and shade of the bird's  plume:--and after all, it is well for us, if, when even for God's best  mercies, and in His temples marble-built, we think that, \"with angels  and archangels, and all the company of Heaven, we laud and magnify His  glorious name\"--well for us, if our attempt be not only an insult, and  His ears open rather to the inarticulate and unintended praise, of \"the  Swallow, twittering from her straw-built shed.\"          LECTURE III.    THE DABCHICKS.      81. I believe that somewhere I have already observed, but permit  myself, for immediate use, to repeat what I cannot but think the  sagacious observation,--that the arrangement of any sort of animals  must be, to say the least, imperfect, if it be founded only on the  characters of their feet. And, of all creatures, one would think birds  were those which, continually dispensing with the use of their feet,  would require for their classification some attention also to be paid  to their bodies and wings,--not to say their heads and tails.  Nevertheless, the ornithological arrangement at present in vogue may  suffice for most scientific persons; but in grouping birds, so that the  groups may be understood and remembered by children, I must try to make  them a little more generally descriptive.    82. In talking of parrots, for instance, it is only a small part of the  creature's nature which is told by its scientific name of 'Scansor,' or  'Climber.' That it only clutches with its claws, and does not snatch or  strike with them;--that it helps itself about with its beak, on  branches, or bars of cage, in an absurd manner, as if partly imagining  itself hung up in a larder, are by no means the most vital matters  about the bird. Whereas, that its beak is always extremely short, and  is bent down so roundly that the angriest parrot cannot peck, but only  _bite_, if you give it a chance; that it _can_ bite, pinch, or  otherwise apply the mechanism of a pair of nut-crackers from the back  of its head, with effect; that it has a little black tongue capable of  much talk; above all, that it is mostly gay in plumage, often to  vulgarity, and always to pertness;--all these characters should surely  be represented to the apprehensive juvenile mind, in sum; and not  merely the bird's climbing qualities.    83. Again, that the race of birds called in Latin 'Rasores' _do_, in  the search for their food, usually scratch, and kick out their legs  behind, living for the most part in gravelly or littery places, of  which the hidden treasures are only to be discovered in that manner,  seems to me no supremely interesting custom of the animal's life, but  only a _manner_ of its household, or threshold, economy. But that the  tribe, on the whole, is unambitiously domestic, and never predatory;  that they fly little and low, eat much of what they can pick up without  trouble--and are _themselves_ always excellent eating;--yet so  exemplary in their own domestic cares and courtesies that one is  ashamed to eat them except in eggs;--that their plumage is for the most  part warm brown, delicately and even bewitchingly spotty;--and that, in  the goodliest species, the spots become variegated, and inlaid as in a  Byzantine pavement, deepening to imperial purple and azure, and  lightening into luster of innumerable eyes;--all this, I hold, very  clearly and positively, should be explained to children as a part of  science, quite as exact, and infinitely more gracious, than that which  reckons up the whole tribe of loving and luminous creatures under the  feebly descriptive term of 'Scratchers.'    I will venture therefore to recommend my younger readers, in classing  birds, to think of them literally from top to toe--from toe to top I  should say,--foot, body, and head, studying, with the body, the wings  that bear it; and with the head, what brains it can bring to bear on  practical matters, and what sense on sentimental. But indeed,  primarily, you have to consider whether the bird altogether may not be  little more than a fat, cheerful little stomach, in a spotted  waistcoat, and with legs to it. That is the main definition of a great  many birds--meant to eat all day, chiefly, grubs, or grain--not at all,  unless under wintry and calamitous conditions, meant to fast painfully,  or be in concern about their food. Faultless in digestion--dinner  lasting all day long, with the delight of social intercourse--various  chirp and chatter. Flying or fluttering in a practical, not stately,  manner: hopping and creeping intelligently. Sociable to man extremely,  building and nestling and rustling about him,--prying and speculating,  curiously watchful of him at his work, if likely to be profitable to  themselves, or even sometimes in mere pitying sympathy, and wonder how  such a wingless and beakless creature can do _any_thing.[17]          [17] Compare 'Paradise of Birds,' (song to the young Roc, page        67,) and see close of lecture for notes on that book.    84. The balance of this kind of bird on its legs is a very important  part of its--diagnosis; (we must have a fine word now and then!) Its  action on the wing, is mere flutter or flirt, in and out of the hedge,  or over it; but its manner of perch, or literally 'bien-seance,' is  admirable matter of interest. So also in the birds which are on the  water what these are on land; picking up anything anywhere; lazy and  fortunate, mostly, themselves; fat, floating, daintiest  darlings;--_their_ balance on the water, also, and under it, in  'ducking,' a most essential part of their business and being.    85. Then, directly opposed to these, in both kinds, you have the birds  which must fast long, and fly far, and watch or fight for their food.  Not stomachic in profile; far from cheerful in disposition; more or  less lonely in habit; or, if gregarious, out of the way of men. The  balance of these on the wing, is no less essential a part of their  picturing, than that of the buntings, robins, and ducks on the foot, or  breast: and therefore, especially the position of the head in flying.    86. Accordingly, for complete ornithology, _every_ bird must be drawn,  as every flower for good botany, both in profile, and looking down upon  it: but for the perchers, the standing profile is the most essential;  and for the falcons and gulls, the flying _plan_,--the outline of the  bird, as it would be seen looking down on it, when its wings were  full-spread.    Then, in connection with these general outlines, we want systematic  plan and profile of the foot and head; but since we can't have  everything at once, let us say the plan of the foot, and profile of the  head, quite accurately given; and for every bird consistently, and to  scale.    Profile and plan in outline; then, at least the _head_ in light and  shade, from life, so as to give the expression of the eye. Fallacious,  this latter, often, as an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21189"],[0,"Aesop, in Rhyme: Old Friends in a New Dress (#11)"],[1," aid you he will bring,  But with excess of love the other  In dreams was thinking of his brother.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE SICK STAG.      In a land where stags are many,  One fell sick, and not any  Of all his friends, delayed to come,  To offer aid and consolation,  In his sorrowful situation.  Said he, \"My friends, pray let me die  In the right way, nor shed such tears.\"  Not at all, the consolers,  With many a tear, and many a sigh,  Had come resolved by him to lie;  And when they left they helped themselves  Upon his lands, the greedy elves!  And drank from out his brook,  And every one of them such suppers took,  That when the stag revived,  He found his meals reduced;  So that while his friends had thrived,  He had to fast or die of hunger.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE FOREST AND THE WOODMAN.      A woodman had broken or misplaced  The wooden handle of his axe,  This loss could not be well replaced.  So master woodman humbly prayed  From all the trees a single branch,  And promised to go elsewhere when he made  Again his livelihood,  And he would touch nor oak nor pine.  The trees which were all very good  Furnished for him new arms,  And soon commenced all their alarms,  And their regret. The axe was mended.  And his repentance all was ended.  The miserable wretch but used it,  E'en as he had before abused it,  By felling down the forest trees,  Which groaned in spirit, and which died,  By arms they had themselves supplied.      MORAL.    This is the way the world goes on,  We use our benefits against our benefactors:  I am tired of speaking thereupon,  Till we obtain our wants, we are good actors.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE ELEPHANT AND THE MONKEY  OF JUPITER.      Formerly the elephant and the rhinoceros  Disputing on the light of empire  Resolved to end the combat thus--  By fighting to their heart's desire.  The day was fixed, when it was heard,  That the monkey of Sire Jupiter  Had been seen in the air,  Poised on a cloud like any bird.  The elephant was quite convinced  That to arrange the new election,  An interest the god evinced,  And felt for him a great affection,  He went to see the monkey's highness,  Expecting him to speak about the fight,  But not a word said monkey.  At this sight,  The elephant perceived that he must speak himself,  And so began: \"Sire Jupiter,\" said he,  \"Between rhinoceros and me will see  A royal combat of legation;  A tournament for all the nation.  I suppose you have already heard  This news!\" Said monkey, \"Not a word.\"  The elephant ashamed, and quite surprised,  Looked on the monkey with astonished eyes.  Said monkey, \"In celestial place,  A fly or leopard are of equal race.\"  \"Was it not then because of us,\"  Said elephant, \"that you descended?\"  \"Nay,\" said the monkey, quite offended.  \"I left the heavens to share a grain of corn  Among some ants, nor knew that you were born.  We have the care of mortal things;  But all are equals in our eyes,  And at your talk I feel surprise.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE WOODCUTTER AND DEATH.      A woodman was toiling, all covered with dust,  But reach home with his faggot ere night he must,  Panting and weary he walks quite slow,  How to get home he does not know.  At last quite exhausted with toil and trouble,  With the weight of the burden and his years, bent double.  He puts down his faggot, and thinks of his pains,  What is his work, and what are his gains,  How since he came into this weary world,  By the wheels of blind fortune around he's been twirled.  Was he not poor, a wood cutter, at best,  Oft without bread, always without rest.  He thinks of his wife, his children, his taxes,  At last quite warm with the subject he waxes.  He calls on death; who comes without delay,  The woodman, in terror, knows not what to say.  Death asks what to do the man wishes he should.  \"Oh, help me,\" he said, \"with this faggot of wood.  My poor bones ache, and my limbs they crack.  So help me to put it upon my back.\"          [Illustration]    THE RAT AND THE OYSTER.      A rat who lived in the field,    A rat of little wit,  Once grew tired of his father's house,    And quietly left it.  He left the field, the grain and wheat,    Set out to travel, left his hole,  And just as soon as he was out,    \"How large and spacious on the whole  Is this great country spread about.  Here are the Apeninnes, and there Caucasus.\"  The smallest mole hill is a mountain.  At the end of some days our traveller arrives  At a certain canton where every oyster thrives,  And our famed traveller turned very pale,  Thinking he saw great vessels setting sail  \"Mercy,\" said he, \"My father was a dunce,  He did not dare to travel even once,  While I have seen already,  The maritime empire,  And travelled to my heart's desire.\"  From a certain learn'd man,  The rat had heard of such things,  And thinks he has seen all he can.  Among the many oysters closed,  There was one open, which reposed,  Mouth gaping, in the sun,  The learned, travelled man,  The rat, approached, thinking to make  An excellent repast, and began to take  A bite at the fine oyster, plump and fat,  Whereupon closing on our rat,  The oyster caught him tight  And held him with all its might.      MORAL.    This fable goes to show,  That those mistake,  Who think that all they know:  When knowing nothing of the world,  Their giddy brain is quickly whirled.  And hence this moral let us make,  That he is caught, who thinks to take.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE PHYSICIANS.      Dr. So-much-the-worse went out to see  A patient sick as one could be.  His brother So-much-the-better,  Having received an urgent letter,  Came also the sick man to visit.  So-much-the-worse declared he'd die,  So-much-the-better asked him why.  And while their plans they thus discourse,  The sick man died, _so much the worse_!  So-much-the-better now declared,  That if the sick man had not despaired,  He would have lived. So-much-the-worse  Said, \"I was right, agree with me,  Our patient's dead, as you can see.\"      MORAL.    There's wisdom in the saying, by my troth,  Too many cooks will spoil the broth.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE MOUNTAIN IN LABOR.      A mountain thought to be in labor,  Made such a horrid noise,  That round it each stranger came and neighbor,  Thinking the end of all this noise would be  A city, quite as large as three.  Having drawn all the province round,  The mountain from a little mound,  Let out a mouse.      MORAL.    When I think upon this fable,  Of which the narration is false,  And the sense true;  It puts me much in mind  Of authors not a few,  Who boast that they are able  To write on any subject as they please,  And after all--do nothing.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE CAT METAMORPHOSED INTO  A WOMAN.      A man was passionately fond of his cat,  He thought she was pretty, and sleek, and all that;  And she purred in the softest tone,  He wished to make her his own.  This man by prayers, by tears,    By sorcery and charms,  Changed pussy to a woman fair,    And took her in his arms.  But in the wainscot soon a rat    Made itself manifest,  And very soon the pussy cat,    Could still no longer rest.  Her foolish husband who believed    That nothing had of cat remained,  And as his wife had her received--    Was, now, I warrant, somewhat pained.  Next time the vermin came,  Pussy was surer of her game--    For having changed her face,  The mice not frightened,    Did not change their pace--  And the astonished spouse    Was very glad--  To change her back--    And was no more cat-mad.      MORAL.    What in the bone is born,    Will in the flesh remain,  Both night and morn,    And ne'er come out again.          [Illustration]    THE FROG AND THE RAT.      He who another thinks to injure,  May in the end destroy himself.    A rat who fed exceeding well,  Was by a frog invited out to dine;  \"The voyage,\" said froggy, \"will be quickly made,  If you will tie your foot to mine.\"  Frog vaunted the delight of bathing,  Praised the varieties they'd met upon the way,  And when the rat consented to be tied,  Attempted to bear him away.  The rat half drowned resisted all he could.  The frog, imaged the dinner he would make;  Suddenly, flying from a neighboring wood,  A hawk appeared, and quickly did he take  Both of the combatants up in his bill,  Before they e'en had time to make their will;  And quite delighted did the greedy sinner  Make off of fish and flesh a hearty dinner.  For in the hawk's dominions, fast days  Are never kept.  Now if the frog had acted as he ought,  And had not tried to dine off the poor rat,  They would not both have perished,  To make fat,  A pampered hawk;  And master rat,  Had he not been so curious about  Aquatic government,  Had from the scrape got safely out.      MORAL.    A scheme or a conspiracy,  Be it all plotted well  As safe, 'twould seem as it could be,  And sure of all success,  May, none the less,  Entirely fail,  And grand conspirators,  And all bewail,  The day that set them scheming.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE LION AND THE FLY.      A lion by a gad-fly worried,  Half maddened by his sting,  Exclaimed, \"Be off, vile fly--  Mean, pitiful, base thing!\"  After the fly had ended his repast,  Fully exhausted feels the beast at last,  And roared so that he shook the earth,  While the victorious fly  Met in the spider's web his destiny.      MORAL.    Two morals draw I from this tale:    First, We should fear the smallest enemy;  And second, We may escape great perils,    And from a trifling cause may die.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE TWO MULES.      Two mules went travelling on their way,    One with a sack of corn;  The other with gold and bells so gay,    Most gaily tripped along.
