This is an index to the idea of purpose which      pervades the town; there is none of the sense that a different      costume is needed for urban life, an idea which arises from the      association of towns with pleasure and display.    [Illustration: BLESSING THE LAMB ON ST. GEORGE'S DAY]        \"Few sights can be more inspiring to the lover of liberty and      national progress than a view of Sofia from the hill where the      great seminary of the national church overlooks the plain. There      at your feet is spread out the unpretentious seat of a      government which stands for the advance of European order in      lands long blighted with barbarism. Here resides, and is      centred, the virile force of a people which has advanced the      bounds of liberty. From here, symbolised by the rivers and roads      running down on each side, has extended, and will further      extend, the power of modern education, of unhampered ideas, of      science and of humanity. From this magnificent view-point Sofia      stretches along the low hill with the dark background of the      Balkan beyond. Against that background now stands out the new      embodiment of Bulgarian and Slavonic energy, genius, and freedom      of mind, the great cathedral, with its vast golden domes      brilliantly standing out from the shade behind them. In no other      capital is a great church shown to such effect, viewed from one      range of hills against the mountainous slopes of another. It is      a building which, with its marvellous mural paintings, would in      any capital form an object of world interest, but which, in the      capital of a tiny peasant State, supremely embodies that breadth      of mind which                 \"... rejects the lore      Of nicely calculated less or more.\"    I confess humbly that I could not see all that in Sofia. But the city  was a welcome surprise, recalling Turin in its situation beneath a great  range of mountains, in its size and its general disposition. With closer  acquaintance, which came to me during the armistice that followed the  first phase of the war, Sofia showed as still clean, well managed,  admirable, but, oh, so deadly dull. The system of partial seclusion of  the women-folk kills all social life, and the absence of a feminine  element in the restaurants and other places of social resort deprives  them of all convivial charm. One could eat, drink, work in Sofia, and  that was all.    Coming first to Sofia just as war had been declared, I was struck by  the evidence of the exceedingly careful preparation that the Bulgarians  had made for the struggle. This was no unexpected or sudden war; they  had known for some time that war was inevitable; for they had made up  their minds for quite a considerable time that the wrongs of their  fellow-nationals in Macedonia and Thrace would have to be righted by  force of arms. Attempts on the part of the Powers to enforce reforms in  the Christian provinces of Turkey had, in the opinion of the Bulgars,  been absolute failures. In their opinion there was nothing to hope for  except armed intervention on their part against Turkey. And, believing  that, they had made most careful preparation, extending over several  years, for this struggle.    That preparation was in every sense admirable. For instance, it had  extended, I gathered from informants in Bulgaria, to this degree, that  they formed military camps in winter for the training of their troops.  Thus they did not train solely in the most favourable time of the year  for manoeuvres, but in the unfavourable weather too, in case that time  should prove favourable for their war. I think the standard of their  artillery arm, and the evidence of the scientific training of their  officers, prove to what extent their training beforehand had gone. Most  of the officers in high command I met at the front had been trained at  the Military College at St. Petrograd, some of them at the Military  College at Turin, and others again at a Military College which had been  established at Sofia. Of this last-named the head was Colonel Jostoff,  who was Chief-of-Staff to General Demetrieff (the great conquering  general of this war), and a singularly able soldier. He was the chief  Professor of the Military College at Sofia, and judging by the standard  he set, the Military College must have reached a high degree of  efficiency.    [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL, SOFIA]    The Balkan League having been formed, and the time being ripe for the  war, Bulgaria was quite determined that war should be. The Turks at that  time were inclined to make reforms and concessions; they had an  inclination to ease the pressure on their Christian subjects in the  Christian provinces. Perhaps knowing--perhaps not knowing--that they  were unready for war themselves, but feeling that the Balkan States were  preparing for war, the Turks were undoubtedly willing to make great  concessions. But whatever concessions the Turks might have offered, war  would still have taken place.    I do not think one need offer any harsh criticism about a nation coming  to such a decision as that. If you have made your preparation for  war--perhaps a very expensive preparation, perhaps a preparation which  has involved very great commitments apart from expense--it is not  reasonable to suppose that at the last moment you will consent to stop  that war.    I was much struck with the wonderful value to the Bulgarian generals of  the fact that the whole Bulgarian nation was filled with the martial  spirit--was, in a sense, wrapped up in the colours. Every male Bulgarian  citizen was trained to the use of arms. Every Bulgarian citizen of  fighting age was engaged either at the front or on the lines of  communication. Before the war, every Bulgarian man, being a soldier, was  under a soldier's honour; and the preliminaries of the war, the  preparations for mobilisation in particular, were carried out with a  degree of secrecy that, I think, astonished every Court and every  Military Department in Europe. The secret was so well kept that one of  the diplomatists in Roumania left for a holiday three days before the  declaration of war, feeling certain that there was to be no war.    Bulgaria has a newspaper Press that, on ordinary matters, for delightful  irresponsibility, might be matched in London. Yet not a single whisper  of what the nation was designing and planning leaked abroad. Because the  whole nation was a soldier, and the whole nation was under a soldier's  honour, absolute secrecy could be kept. No one abroad knew anything,  either from the babbling of \"Pro-Turks,\" or from the newspapers, that  this great campaign was being designed by Bulgaria.    The Secret Service of Bulgaria before the war had evidently been  excellent. They seemed to know all that was necessary to know about the  country in which they were going to fight; and I think this very  complete knowledge of theirs was in part responsible for the  arrangements which were made between the Balkan Allies for carrying on  the war. The Bulgarian people had made up their minds to do the lion's  share of the work and to have the lion's share of the spoils, for the  Bulgarian people knew the state of corruption and rottenness to which  the Turkish nation had come. When I reached Sofia, the Bulgarians told  me they were going to be in Constantinople three weeks after the  declaration of war. That was the view that they took of the  possibilities of the campaign. And they kept their programme as far as  Chatalja fairly closely.    Having declared war, the Bulgarians invaded Turkey along two main lines,  by the railway which passed through Adrianople to Constantinople and by  the wild mountain passes of the north between Yamboli and Kirk Kilisse.  There was great enterprise shown in this second line of advance and it  was responsible for all the great victories won. Taking Kirk Kilisse by  surprise the Bulgarian forces kept the Turkish vanguard on the run until  Lule Burgas, where the Turkish main army made a stand and the decisive  battle of the campaign was fought. The Turks were utterly routed and  fled in confusion towards Constantinople by Tchorlu. Had an enterprising  pursuit on the part of the Bulgarians been possible, the Bulgarian army  undoubtedly would have then entered Constantinople and the Christmas  Mass would have been said at St. Sophia. But the strength of the  Bulgarian attack was exhausted by the tremendous exertions of marching  and fighting which they had already made and a long pause to recuperate  was necessary. That pause enabled the Turks to re-marshal their forces  and to make a stand at the fortified lines of Chatalja some twenty miles  as the crow flies from Constantinople. Against those lines a Bulgarian  attack was finally launched, but too late. The entrenched Turks were  strong enough to withstand the attack of the Bulgarian forces. My diary  of these three critical days of the campaign reads:        ERMENIKIOI        (Headquarters of the Third Bulgarian Army),        _November 17 (Sunday)._        The battle of Chatalja has been opened. To-day, General      Demetrieff rode out with his staff to the battlefield whilst the      bells of a Christian church in this little village rang. The day      was spent in artillery reconnaissance, the Bulgarian guns      searching the Turkish entrenchments to discover their real      strength. Only once during the day was the infantry employed;      and then it was rather to take the place of artillery than to      complete the work begun by artillery. It seems to me that the      Bulgarian forces have not enough big gun ammunition at the      front. They are ten days from their base and shells must come up      by ox-waggon the greater part of the way.

[Illustration: (_H.J.L.J.M._)     INTERIOR OF THE TOWER ABOVE THE VAULTING.]    Nothing is known of the place of origin of the pre-Reformation bells,  but, arguing from the proximity of Gloucester, it may be assumed that  out of the eight bells weighing 14,200 lb. or more, some may have been  cast by John Sandre, of Gloucester.    The eight bells were bought from the King's Commissioners for L142,  _i.e._, at the rate of 5 lb. for a shilling. They may have been  bought to sell again, as the number was soon reduced to _four_. In  1612 a fifth bell was added, as a rhyme on the cover of the baptismal  register (1607-1629) tells us:        \"William Dixon and Thomas Hoare       Made us that bell which wee ring before,       Which men for that good deede praie we they maie thrive,       For we having but four bells, they made them five;       And out of the grownde this bell they did delve       The 24th of Julie, Anno Dom. 1612.\"    Near the arcaded passage in the room in the tower are some memoranda  of the changes possible with five bells, rudely engraved in the  stonework.    In 1632 the peal was recast and a sixth bell was added, and in 1679  the two newest bells were recast. Two new bells were added in 1696. In  1797 the great or tenor bell was recast. From the time when the bells  were overhauled and tuned at Gloucester, in 1837, no further  alteration has been made. The present peal is about 500 lb. less in  weight than the peal in use at the time of the Dissolution.    From the top of the tower a fine view is to be obtained--Cheltenham,  and Gloucester, with its beautiful Cathedral tower, on the south, the  Malvern Hills on the west, the Cotswolds on the east and north-east.  The Severn and the Avon wind through the landscape, and on the far  horizon may be seen the distant hills of Wales.    The old shafting has been chipped away on the west face of the  stonework opposite to the north-east tower pier. As one turns round  the corner into the north ambulatory or choir aisle, it will be  noticed that on the wall is a monument by Flaxman to Lady Clarke; it  is small and unobtrusive, but the sculpture is thoroughly good and  worthy of a great artist.    On the right hand opposite is the Warwick Chapel (p. 83), of which the  glory in part has departed, viz., the decoration in colour and in  gold, and much of the architectural detail.    =St. James' Chapel.=[14]--This chapel (dimensions 28 feet by 24 feet),  which opens on to the north transept of the north ambulatory, was from  1576 up to 1875 walled off from the rest of the church and used as  premises for the \"Free Grammar School of William Ferrers, citizen and  mercer of London.\" The school ceased to be held here about forty years  ago, but the inserted masonry and brickwork was not removed till the  restoration of 1875 and following years, when the chapel was restored  by the Freemasons of the county. From the time that the chapel ceased  to be a school it fell into a bad state of repair, and was open to the  sky before the recent restoration, when the present roof of timber,  covered with lead--the only wooden roof in the church--was erected and  the stonework repaired.    There seems no doubt that this chapel was originally a Norman apse  with a vaulted chamber[15] above, like that in the sister transept,  and that it was enlarged in the thirteenth century by Prior Henry  Sipton. This is distinctly stated in Annals to have been done in the  case of the chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas in 1237. No trace remains  of any of the work of Prior Sipton owing to the later works carried  out in this chapel. The nave of a Lady Chapel was built on the north  side of the north transept, and its chancel (the existing northern  part of the choir vestry) was carried out to the east, this portion of  the chapel being quite detached, as the windows (now blocked up) in  the upper part of the south wall plainly show. Access for the laity  was given by a door in the nave portion, while the monks had an  entrance through the adjoining chapel, which may, after its rebuilding  in 1237, have contained two altars, one to St. James and another to  St. Nicholas. This theory of the two altars in this chapel would  account for much of the confusion in the naming of the chapel by  subsequent writers. The vaulting of this chapel is at first sight a  difficult problem to solve, as the eastern side is divided into two  equal parts, while the western side is divided into two unequal parts.  A pillar seems to have stood in the centre, if the lists of noblemen  buried (after the battle in 1471) in the two chapels are trustworthy.  When the fourteenth century Lady Chapel at the east end of the church  was built, the _raison d'etre_ of the Early English Lady Chapel  ceased, and the chapel entrances were enlarged to their present form.  Any distinctive features that they had in the way of wall decoration  were lost either at the Dissolution, when part was pulled down, or  during the subsequent use of the eastern chapels as a schoolroom.    Passing through into the adjoining chapel on the north, which was  probably the chancel of an =Early English Lady Chapel=, the visitor  will note the great contrast between this and the adjacent chapel. It  is very much richer in its ornament, and though it has been terribly  mutilated, much work of surpassing interest is still left to us. The  north wall contains the remains of a trefoil-headed arcade of great  beauty, the spandrils of which show richly carved foliage, the effect  of which was further heightened by the application of colour. Of the  arcading eleven capitals remain, but only three pillars and bases, the  rest having been cleared away.       [Illustration: (_H.J.L.J.M._)     WALL ARCADE IN EARLY ENGLISH CHAPEL.]    In the wall of the present west end is a window decorated with a  moulding consisting of two series of chevrons, completely undercut,  pointing laterally in contrary directions.[16] Numerous interesting  remains of Early English mason's work are in the chapel, and many  have been built into the wall on the east side, the most important  being remains of a fine altar-piece in Purbeck marble.    There is a window on the east side containing four lights, the  subjects, beginning from the north side, being as follows:--(1) The  mythical Saxon founders, Oddo and Doddo, A.D. 715. (2) The Norman  founders, _i.e._, Fitz-Hamon and Sibylla. (3) Earl Robert, 1089-1123.  (4) The Countess of Warwick, 1439. The figures are based on the MS.  Chronicle of the Abbey, belonging to Sir Charles Isham of Lamport.  This window, the tracery of which is new, is by Bourne of Birmingham,  and forms a memorial to a former churchwarden, John Garrison, who died  in 1876. The tracery contains the red and white roses of the rival  houses of Lancaster and York, appropriately enough, seeing that under  the floor, in front of the altar to St. James, are interred the  remains of Lord Edmund, the Duke of Somerset, Lord Thomas Courtenay,  the Earl of Devon, Sir Richard Courtenay, Lord John Somerset, and Sir  Humphrey Hadley, who were beheaded after the battle of Tewkesbury. Sir  Thomas Tresham, who also was beheaded at the same time, was buried  before a pillar between the altars of St. James and St. Nicholas.    The whole of this part of the chapel was once the choir or chancel of  the detached Early English Lady Chapel which was erected early in the  thirteenth century. The Annals of Tewkesbury record that in 1239 the  _Church_ of Tewkesbury with a greater altar was dedicated in honour of  the glorious Virgin Mary. The word Church might mean this Early  English Lady Chapel, which with its nave and chancel would be a model  church, although somewhat small in size; but the words _majore altari_  are generally taken to mean the large slab of Purbeck marble now in  its place in the choir as an altar slab.    Lady Chapels were not invariably at the east end of the main building.  At Bristol there was and is still an elder Lady Chapel which at one  time was detached from the main building.    The floor in these chapels is that which was formerly in the choir up  to the time of the restoration of the church.    =St. Margaret's Chapel.=--This is one of the series of the fourteenth  century chapels which surrounds the ambulatory of the choir.    An old altar-cloth which was given by Anne, Countess of Coventry, in  1731 to the church was removed to this chapel after the restoration of  the building.       [Illustration: _Photo. A.H. Hughes._     THE AMBULATORY, LOOKING TOWARDS ST. MARGARET'S CHAPEL.]    A very fine screen of stonework separates this chapel from the  ambulatory, the tomb of Sir Guy de Brien (late Decorated--erected in  1390) forming part of the screen.[17] Sir Guy was the third husband of  the Lady Elizabeth Despenser who is buried in the tomb on the other  side of the ambulatory. In the panelling are the arms of Sir Guy, who  was also Lord Welwyn, and those of his wife, who was by birth a  Montacute. This knight served Edward III. as standard-bearer at Crecy  in 1346, and was a great benefactor to the Abbey. He is credited with  the vaulting of the tower, as his arms occur in the bosses there.    The vaulting, which springs from engaged shafts, is excellent work,  like that in the other chapels, and the bosses are worth notice. In  the central boss in the ceiling the Coronation of the Virgin is  represented, and surrounding it are heads of lions and of men.    An aumbry, lavabo, and piscina are all worthy of study.    =St. Edmund's Chapel.=--The ground-plan of this chapel is curious, as  it is apparently divided into two by a kind of re-entrant pier of  masonry, and the easternmost part is screened off from the ambulatory  by the curious tomb known by the name of the Wakeman Cenotaph, or the  tomb of the starved monk (_vide_ p. 94).    In this chapel is a large aumbry, and a very perfect stone coffin  which was dug up in the south ambulatory"]]]
