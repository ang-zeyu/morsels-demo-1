FERDINAND.  Her melancholy seems to be fortified    With a strange disdain.      BOSOLA.                  'Tis so; and this restraint,    Like English mastives that grow fierce with tying,    Makes her too passionately apprehend    Those pleasures she is kept from.      FERDINAND.                         Curse upon her!    I will no longer study in the book    Of another's heart.  Inform her what I told you.         Exit.           [Enter DUCHESS and Attendants]      BOSOLA.  All comfort to your grace!      DUCHESS.                             I will have none.    Pray thee, why dost thou wrap thy poison'd pills    In gold and sugar?      BOSOLA.  Your elder brother, the Lord Ferdinand,    Is come to visit you, and sends you word,    'Cause once he rashly made a solemn vow    Never to see you more, he comes i' th' night;    And prays you gently neither torch nor taper    Shine in your chamber.  He will kiss your hand,    And reconcile himself; but for his vow    He dares not see you.      DUCHESS.               At his pleasure.--    Take hence the lights.--He 's come.

You have it;    For I account it the honorabl'st revenge,    Where I may kill, to pardon.--Where are your cubs?      DUCHESS.  Whom?      FERDINAND.       Call them your children;    For though our national law distinguish bastards    ]From true legitimate issue, compassionate nature    Makes them all equal.      DUCHESS.

It had been well,    Could you have liv'd thus always; for, indeed,    You were too much i' th' light:--but no more;    I come to seal my peace with you.  Here 's a hand         Gives her a dead man's hand.    To which you have vow'd much love; the ring upon 't    You gave.      DUCHESS.  I affectionately kiss it.      FERDINAND.  Pray, do, and bury the print of it in your heart.    I will leave this ring with you for a love-token;    And the hand as sure as the ring; and do not doubt    But you shall have the heart too.  When you need a friend,    Send it to him that ow'd it; you shall see    Whether he can aid you.      DUCHESS.

He doth present you this sad spectacle,    That, now you know directly they are dead,    Hereafter you may wisely cease to grieve    For that which cannot be recovered.      DUCHESS.  There is not between heaven and earth one wish    I stay for after this.

Come, you must live.      DUCHESS.  That 's the greatest torture souls feel in hell,    In hell, that they must live, and cannot die.    Portia,[100] I 'll new kindle thy coals again,    And revive the rare and almost dead example    Of a loving wife.      BOSOLA.            O, fie! despair?  Remember    You are a Christian.      DUCHESS.              The church enjoins fasting:    I 'll starve myself to death.      BOSOLA.                        Leave this vain sorrow.    Things being at the worst begin to mend:  the bee    When he hath shot his sting into your hand,    May then play with your eye-lid.      DUCHESS.                          Good comfortable fellow,    Persuade a wretch that 's broke upon the wheel    To have all his bones new set; entreat him live    To be executed again.  Who must despatch me?    I account this world a tedious theatre,    For I do play a part in 't 'gainst my will.      BOSOLA.  Come, be of comfort; I will save your life.      DUCHESS.

Thou art a fool, then,    To waste thy pity on a thing so wretched    As cannot pity itself.  I am full of daggers.    Puff, let me blow these vipers from me.         [Enter Servant]    What are you?      SERVANT.       One that wishes you long life.      DUCHESS.

To ascend the valleys and  cross the water-shed of the great Quathlamba Range on to the plateau  takes a little longer, yet no great time. Then, once upon the plateau,  the traveller may proceed steadily to the west for more than a thousand  miles over an enormous stretch of high but nearly level land, meeting no  considerable eminence and crossing no perceptible water-shed till he  comes within sight of the waves of the Atlantic. Or if he turns to the  north-west he will pass over an undulating country, diversified only by  low hills, till he dips slowly into the flat and swampy ground which  surrounds Lake Ngami, itself rather a huge swamp than a lake, and  descends very gradually from that level to the banks of the Zambesi, in  the neighbourhood of the great Victoria Falls. In fact, this great  plateau is South Africa, and all the rest of the country along the  sea-margin a mere appendage to it. But so large a part of the plateau  is, as we shall see presently, condemned by its dryness to remain  sterile and very thinly peopled, that the interior has not that  preponderating importance which its immense area might seem to give it.    It is not worth while to describe the minor ridges,--though some of  them, especially in Cape Colony, are abrupt and high enough to be called  Mountains,--for none has any great importance as affecting either  material or historical conditions. The longest are those which run  parallel to the dreary and almost uninhabited west coast, and form the  terraces by which the great plateau sinks down to the margin of the  Atlantic. Neither can I touch on the geology, except to observe that a  great part of the plateau, especially in the northern part and towards  the north-east end of the Quathlamba Range, consists of granite or  gneiss, and is believed to be of very great antiquity, _i.e._, to have  stood, as it now stands, high above the level of the sea from a very  remote period of the earth's history. The rocks of the Karroo region are  more recent. Nowhere in South Africa has any area of modern volcanic  action, much less any active volcano, been discovered. More ancient  eruptive rocks, such as greenstones and porphyries, are of frequent  occurrence, and are often spread out in level sheets above the  sedimentary beds of the Karroo and of the Basutoland and Free State  ranges.    Finally, it must be noted that the coast has extremely few harbours.  From Cape Town eastward and north-eastward there is no sheltered  deep-water haven till one reaches that of Durban, itself troubled by a  bar, and from Durban to the Zambesi no good ports save Delagoa Bay and  Beira. On the other side of the continent, Saldanha Bay, twenty miles  north of Cape Town, is an excellent harbour. After that the Atlantic  coast shows none for a thousand miles.    So much for the surface and configuration of the country. Now let us  come to the climate, which is a not less important element in making  South Africa what it is.    The heat is, of course, great, though less great than a traveller from  North Africa or India expects to find in such a latitude. Owing to the  vast mass of water in the southern hemisphere, that hemisphere is cooler  in the same latitude than is the northern. Cape Town, in latitude 34 deg.  S., has a colder winter and not so hot a summer as Gibraltar and  Aleppo, in latitude 36 deg. N. Still the summer temperature is high even at  Durban, in latitude 30 deg. S., while the northern part of the Transvaal  Republic, and all the territories of the British South Africa Company,  including Matabililand and Mashonaland, lie within the tropic of  Capricorn, that is to say, correspond in latitude to Nubia and the  central provinces of India between Bombay and Calcutta.    The climate is also, over most of the country, extremely dry. Except in  a small district round Cape Town, at the southern extremity of the  continent, there is no proper summer and winter, but only a dry season,  the seven or eight months when the weather is colder, and a wet season,  the four or five months when the sun is highest. Nor are the rains that  fall in the wet season so copious and continuous as they are in some  other hot countries; in many parts of India, for instance, or in the  West Indies and Brazil. Thus even in the regions where the rainfall is  heaviest, reaching thirty inches or more in the year, the land soon  dries up and remains parched till the next wet season comes. The air is  therefore extremely dry, and, being dry, it is clear and stimulating in  a high degree.    Now let us note the influence upon the climate of that physical  structure we have just been considering. The prevailing wind, and the  wind that brings most of the rain in the wet season, is the east or  south-east. It gives a fair supply of moisture to the low coast strip  which has been referred to above. Passing farther inland, it impinges  upon the hills which run down from the Quathlamba Range, waters them,  and sometimes falls in snow on the loftiest peaks. A certain part of the  rain-bearing clouds passes still farther inland, and scatters showers  over the eastern part of the tableland, that is to say, over the  Transvaal, the Orange Free State, eastern Bechuanaland, and the  territories still farther north, toward the Zambesi. Very little  humidity, however, reaches the tracts farther to the west. The northern  part of Cape Colony as far as the Orange River, the western part of  Bechuanaland, and the wide expanse of Damaraland have a quite trifling  rainfall, ranging from four or five to ten inches in the whole year.  Under the intense heat of the sun this moisture soon vanishes, the  surface bakes hard, and the vegetation withers. All this region is  therefore parched and arid, much of it, in fact, a desert, and likely  always to remain so.    These great and dominant physical facts--a low coast belt, a high  interior plateau, a lofty, rugged mountain-range running nearly parallel  to, and not very far from, the shore of the ocean, whence the rainclouds  come, a strong sun, a dry climate--have determined the character of  South Africa in many ways. They explain the very remarkable fact that  South Africa has, broadly speaking, no rivers. Rivers are, indeed,  marked on the map--rivers of great length and with many tributaries; but  when in travelling during the dry season you come to them you find  either a waterless bed or a mere line of green and perhaps unsavoury  pools. The streams that run south and east from the mountains to the  coast are short and rapid torrents after a storm, but at other times  dwindle to feeble trickles of mud. In the interior there are, to be  sure, rivers which, like the Orange River or the Limpopo, have courses  hundreds of miles in length. But they contain so little water during  three-fourths of the year as to be unserviceable for navigation, while  most of their tributaries shrink in the dry season to a chain of pools,  scarcely supplying drink to the cattle on their banks. This is one of  the reasons why the country remained so long unexplored. People could  not penetrate it by following waterways, as happened both in North and  in South America; they were obliged to travel by ox-waggon, making only  some twelve or sixteen miles a day, and finding themselves obliged to  halt, when a good bit of grass was reached, to rest and restore the  strength of their cattle. For the same reason the country is now forced  to depend entirely upon railways for internal communication. There is  not a stream (except tidal streams) fit to float anything drawing three  feet of water.    It is a curious experience to travel for hundreds of miles, as one may  do in the dry season in the north-eastern part of Cape Colony and in  Bechuanaland, through a country which is inhabited, and covered in some  places with wood, in others with grass or shrublets fit for cattle, and  see not a drop of running water, and hardly even a stagnant pond. It is  scarcely less strange that such rivers as there are should be useless  for navigation. But the cause is to be found in the two facts already  stated. In those parts where rain falls it comes at one season, within  three or four months. Moreover, it comes then in such heavy storms that  for some hours, or even days, the streams are so swollen as to be not  only impassable by waggons, but also unnavigable, because, although  there is plenty of water, the current is too violent. Then when the  floods have ceased the streams fall so fast, and the channel becomes so  shallow, that hardly even a canoe will float. The other fact arises from  the proximity to the east coast of the great Quathlamba chain of  mountains. The rivers that flow from it have mostly short courses, while  the few that come down from behind and break through it, as does the  Limpopo, are interrupted at the place where they break through by rapids  which no boat can ascend.    [Footnote 3: In particular I will ask the reader to refer to the two  maps showing the physical features of the country which have been  inserted in this volume.]          CHAPTER II    HEALTH      The physical conditions just described determine the healthfulness of  the country, and this is a matter of so much moment, especially to those  who think of settling in South Africa, that I take the earliest  opportunity of referring to it.    The sun-heat would make the climate very trying to Europeans, and of  course more trying the farther north toward the Equator they live, were  it not for the two redeeming points I have dwelt on--the elevation and  the dryness of the interior. To be 3000, 4000, or 5000 feet above the  sea is for most purposes the same thing as being in a more temperate  latitude, and more than five-sixths in area of the districts which are  now inhabited by Europeans have an elevation of fully 3000"]]]
