In spite of the efforts of his friends, Luther was not permitted to be  present at the beginning of the proceedings; but subsequently he was  sent for by the Emperor, in order that he might state his case. His  journey to Worms was one long triumph, especially at Erfurt, where he  was received with enthusiasm by the Humanists as the enemy of the  Papacy. But his presence in the Reichstag was unavailing, and the  proceedings resulted in his being placed under the ban of the empire.  The safe-conduct of the Emperor was, however, in his case respected;  and in spite of the fears of his friends that a like fate might  befall him as had befallen Huss after the Council of Constance, he was  allowed to depart unmolested.    On his way to Wittenberg Luther was seized, by arrangement with his  supporter, the Kurfuerst of Saxony, and conveyed in safety to the  Castle of Wartburg, in Thueringen, a report in the meantime being  industriously circulated by certain of his adherents, with a view of  arousing popular feeling, that he had been arrested by order of the  Emperor and was being tortured. In this way he was secured from all  danger for the time being, and it was during his subsequent stay that  he laid the foundations of the literary language of Germany.    Says a contemporary writer,[8] an eye-witness of what went on at Worms  during the sitting of the Reichstag: \"All is disorder and confusion.  Seldom a night doth pass but that three or four persons be slain. The  Emperor hath installed a provost, who hath drowned, hanged, and  murdered over a hundred men.\" He proceeds: \"Stabbing, whoring,  flesh-eating (it was in Lent) ... altogether there is an orgie worthy  of the Venusberg.\" He further states that many gentlemen and other  visitors had drunk themselves to death on the strong Rhenish wine.  Aleander was in danger of being murdered by the Lutheran populace,  instigated thereto by Hutten's inflammatory letters from the  neighbouring Castle of Ebernburg, in which Franz von Sickingen had  given him a refuge. The fiery Humanist wrote to Aleander himself,  saying that he would leave no stone unturned \"till thou who earnest  hither full of wrath, madness, crime, and treachery shalt be carried  hence a lifeless corpse.\" Aleander naturally felt exceedingly  uncomfortable, and other supporters of the Papal party were not less  disturbed at the threats which seemed in a fair way of being carried  out. The Emperor himself was without adequate means of withstanding a  popular revolt should it occur. He had never been so low in cash or in  men as at that moment. On the other hand, Sickingen, to whom he owed  money, and who was the only man who could have saved the situation  under the circumstances, had matters come to blows, was almost overtly  on the side of the Lutherans; while the whole body of the impoverished  knighthood were only awaiting a favourable opportunity to overthrow  the power of the magnates, secular and ecclesiastic, with Sickingen as  a leader. Such was the state of affairs at the beginning of the year  1521.    The ban placed upon Luther by the Reichstag marks the date of the  complete rupture between the Reforming party and the old Church.  Henceforward, many Humanist and Humanistically influenced persons who  had supported him withdrew from the movement and swelled the ranks of  the Conservatives. Foremost amongst these were Pirckheimer, the  wealthy merchant and scholar of Nuernberg, and many others, who dreaded  lest the attack on ecclesiastical property and authority should, as  indeed was the case, issue in a general attack on all property and  authority. Thomas Murner, also, who was the type of the \"moderate\" of  the situation, while professing to disapprove of the abuses of the  Church, declared that Luther's manner of agitation could only lead to  the destruction of all order, civil no less than ecclesiastical. The  two parties were now clearly defined, and the points at issue were  plainly irreconcilable with one another or involved irreconcilable  details.    The printing-press now for the first time appeared as the vehicle for  popular literature; the art of the bard gave place to the art of the  typographer, and the art of the preacher saw confronting it a  formidable rival in that of the pamphleteer. Similarly in the French  Revolution, modern journalism, till then unimportant and sporadic,  received its first great development, and began seriously to displace  alike the preacher, the pamphlet, and the broadside. The flood of  theological disquisitions, satires, dialogues, sermons, which now  poured from every press in Germany, overflowed into all classes of  society. These writings are so characteristic of the time that it is  worth while devoting a few pages to their consideration, the more  especially because it will afford us the opportunity for considering  other changes in that spirit of the age, partly diseased growths of  decaying mediaevalism and partly the beginnings of the modern critical  spirit, which also find expression in the literature of the  Reformation period.

CHAPTER II    POPULAR LITERATURE OF THE TIME      In accordance with the conventional view the Reichstag at Worms was a  landmark in the history of the Reformation. This is, however, only  true as regards the political side of the movement. The popular  feeling was really quite continuous, at least from 1517 to 1525. With  the latter year and the collapse of the peasant revolt a change is  noticeable. In 1525 the Reformation, as a great upstirring of the  popular mind of Central Europe, in contradistinction to its character  as an academic and purely political movement, reached high-water mark,  and may almost be said to have exhausted itself. Until the latter year  it was purely a revolutionary movement, attracting to itself all the  disruptive elements of its time. Later, the reactionary possibilities  within it declared themselves. The emancipation from the thraldom of  the Catholic hierarchy and its Papal head, it was soon found, meant  not emancipation from the arbitrary tyranny of the new political and  centralizing authorities then springing up, but, on the contrary,  rather their consecration. The ultimate outcome, in fact, of the whole  business was, as we shall see later on, the inculcation of the  non-resistance theory as regards the civil power, and the clearing of  the way for its extremest expression in the doctrine of the Divine  Right of Kings, a theory utterly alien to the belief and practice of  the Mediaeval Church.    The Reichstag of Worms, by cutting off all possibility of  reconciliation, rather gave further edge to the popular revolutionary  side of the movement than otherwise. The whole progress of the change  in public feeling is plainly traceable in the mass of ephemeral  literature that has come down to us from this period, broadsides,  pamphlets, satires, folk-songs, and the rest. The anonymous literature  to which we more especially refer is distinguished by its coarse  brutality and humour, even in the writings of the Reformers, which  were themselves in no case remarkable for the suavity of their  polemic.    Hutten, in some of his later vernacular poems, approaches the  character of the less-cultured broadside literature. To the critical  mind it is somewhat amusing to note the enthusiasm with which the  modern Dissenting and Puritan class contemplates the period of which  we are writing--an enthusiasm that would probably be effectively  damped if the laudators of the Reformation knew the real character of  the movement and of its principal actors.    The first attacks made by the broadside literature were naturally  directed against the simony and benefice-grabbing of the clergy, a  characteristic of the priestly office that has always powerfully  appealed to the popular mind. Thus the \"Courtisan and Benefice-eater\"  attacks the parasite of the Roman Court, who absorbs ecclesiastical  revenues wholesale, putting in perfunctory _locum tenens_ on the  cheap, and begins:--        I'm fairly called a Simonist and eke a Courtisan,      And here to every peasant and every common man      My knavery will very well appear.      I called and cried to all who'd give me ear,      To nobleman and knight and all above me:      \"Behold me! And ye'll find I'll truly love ye.\"    In another we read:--        The Paternoster teaches well      How one for another his prayers should tell,      Thro' brotherly love and not for gold,      And good those same prayers God doth hold.      So too saith Holy Paul right clearly,      Each shall his brother's load bear dearly.    But now, it declares, all that is changed. Now we are being taught  just the opposite of God's teachings:--        Such doctrine hath the priests increased,      Whom men as masters now must feast,      'Fore all the crowd of Simonists,      Whose waxing number no man wists,      The towns and thorps seem full of them,      And in all lands they're seen with shame.      Their violence and knavery      Leave not a church or living free.    A prose pamphlet, apparently published about the summer of 1520,  shortly after Luther's ex-communication, was the so-called \"Wolf Song\"  (_Wolf-gesang_), which paints the enemies of Luther as wolves. It  begins with a screed on the creation and fall of Adam, and a  dissertation on the dogma of the Redemption; and then proceeds: \"As  one might say, dear brother, instruct me, for there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20464"],[0,"A Journey Through France in War Time (#11)"],[1,"the history of the  Church, and then again in the Renaissance presenting the world with  the most beautiful example of the work of Mansard, the City Hall.    It seemed that most that was best in the history of architecture in  France was epitomized in the monuments of Arles. To the connoisseur  in America, Arles is well-known. I remember many years ago their  pointing out to me the portal of Trinity Church in Boston, saying  it was inspired from a church called St. Trophime in a town called  Arles in France. The architect of that church, Richardson, our  greatest American architect, was a great lover of Arles. He came  here often for inspiration. Through him, Arles had a great  influence on American architecture of the time.    Recently there was in New York City a competition among leading  architects for a great court house. The design which won was  frankly admitted by its author--Guy Lowell--to be inspired by the  Arena of Arles, of which he is a most enthusiastic admirer.    A number of outdoor theatres have sprung up of late throughout  America. The Roman theatre at Arles is their model.    There is an impression prevalent in France that the average  American thinks only of business; that the higher things of life  have no interest for him. It is far from true. The members of this  Industrial Commission are truly representative of the average  interest and point of view of the American business man,  manufacturer and technical man, and yet each one of them has gone  out of his way to express his delight in his visit to Arles. All  consider it one of the most valuable parts of the trip. Yes, a  marked change is coming over the American business man. He is  recognizing that there is far more in life than being tied to his  job without a let-up. He is relaxing now and then, and in his  relaxation he is discovering the France that his wife and daughter  know. He should come to Arles. He has begun to come a little. We  hope he will come in far greater numbers in the future. It remains  for you to spread broadcast the virtues of Arles. We sincerely hope  that you will miss no opportunities to do this for we believe it  will tend to weave another important bond of understanding and  sympathy between the two countries.    We visited Angna Castle in Arles, to which the Popes were once exiled,  even yet known as the \"Home of Popes\", or \"Popes' Castle\".    Arles contains convalescent hospitals, and Red Cross girls, with their  cans, having a slot, were collecting coins everywhere. Arles is an  ancient Roman town. We visited the famous Hotel de Ville, or Town Hall,  which dates back to the Seventeenth century. The architect was Mansard,  for whom the Mansard roof, known in America, is named. The Town Hall is  covered by a curious roof, with supports which hold up the entire  building. In the square is an Egyptian obelisk four thousand years old.    We visited another ancient museum and were shown among other things a  very ancient lead pipe six inches in diameter and in a good state of  preservation. In a sarcophagus of the second century were the remains of  a Roman musician, with an inscription thereon. In addition there was a  statue of Emperor Augustus and a statue of Venus of Arles, with some  original and some restored jars and vases more than two thousand years  old.    We visited an old church founded by St. Trophime, noted in the Bible in  the epistles of St. Paul. Barbarossa, Emperor of Germany, was crowned in  this church. I was struck by a tablet of \"Moses crossing the Red Sea\" on  one of the walls. This tablet, a most beautiful and interesting piece of  art, reminded me of an experience of my younger days which served to fix  in my mind the celebrated passage of the Israelites in a manner the  effectiveness of which would be envied by the average Sunday School  teacher, even if it was not entirely due to reverence. I had often told  this story to my friends and again told it that evening to some of the  members of the Commission, who seemed to enjoy it well enough to justify  its repetition here.    About the close of the Civil War in 1865, I paid a visit to a younger  brother who was managing a small charcoal blast furnace in Tennessee. I  had never been in this part of the South before and had received minute  instructions as to how to find the place.    Embarking at Nashville on a Cumberland river boat, after a day's ride, I  left the boat in accordance with my brother's instructions at a small  landing and, crossing the river on a ferry, remained over night at a  cabin occupied by a pious old Negro. A horse was sent me at this humble  abode the following morning.    Some little time after finishing a hearty meal composed almost wholly of  corn pone, the old gentleman brought out a time worn Bible and read two  or three chapters. He then announced that we would all unite in prayer.  We all kneeled down. He invoked the Divine blessing upon the rulers of  the earth, the President of the United States and almost everything else  movable and immovable, on land, under the sea and over the sea. After he  had prayed fully a half hour, tired and sleepy, I became impatient and  nudged the half-grown boy next to me with a query as to how long the  prayer would last. Meantime the boy had fallen asleep. However my nudge  woke him up and, repeating my inquiry, I was answered with the  question:--\"Has pap got to where Moses crossed de Red Sea\"? \"No, he has  not got to that yet,\" was my answer. \"Well, when Pap gets to where Moses  done crossed de Red Sea, he am jes half through.\"    We saw also in this church the tomb of Montcalm, grandfather of  Montcalm, the French general who fell at the taking of Quebec in the  French and English war during the Seventeenth century.    We visited Roman walls and ramparts built by Julius Caesar, and saw an  ancient cemetery directly opposite a munitions factory, which we thought  was a very appropriate location. This cemetery had been pillaged and the  ancient things carried away as relics.    We also visited, while at Arles, a convalescent camp, and saw a number  of Moroccan soldiers.    A point of great interest is the ancient Roman Theatre, built by  Augustus Caesar and containing a statue of that Emperor. Another is the  Arena, built in the first century, restored and reconstructed, and now  used as an outdoor theatre. Sarah Bernhardt played there two years ago  in a Shakesperian representation. It was used in the olden days for the  entertainment of royalty, for gladiatorial contests, and battles of wild  beasts. It is frequently used now for bull rights, as this part of  France is near the Spanish border.    In front of the Hotel Du Nord is the statue of Mistral, the great poet  of Provence.    We visited the Palace of Constantine, Roman Emperor in the fourth  century. In this place remains a pool with means for heating water which  would be considered in good form at the present day.    Arles is a famous centre of architecture and has been visited by all the  great architects of the world. Here many received high inspiration, as  stated in the address given by Mr. Ford.    En route to Arles we had noticed an old Roman theatre in the village of  Orange. We noticed also, which seemed to be common in South France, that  the horses wore a leather horn on the tops of their collars. This is  said to be a usage handed down from the Middle Ages. In this region we  passed whole train loads of grapes, which looked from a short distance  like carloads of anthracite coal.    Our next destination was Marseilles, and here Henri Brenier met us. We  stopped at Martique, which was the home of Ziem, the great French  painter, now deceased. We visited the Ziem museum. The lake of Martique  is where the new port of Marseilles is to be located. This town dates  back six hundred years B. C. We met here the president, Adrien Artaud,  and the vice-president, Hubert Giraud, of the Chamber of Commerce of  Marseilles.    [Illustration: Old Roman Arena at Arles--Still Used For Bull Fights and  Other Amusements.]          VIII.    ALONG THE MEDITERRANEAN      Arriving at De Rove, the south end of the tunnel, on Saturday, September  23rd, I had my first view of the Mediterranean. It was a most beautiful  sight, and the water as blue as pictured in paintings. We were rowed in  a small boat across an arm of the Mediterranean to the town of  Marseilles. We first visited the new part of Marseilles; then the old.  Upon our arrival there was a tremendous gathering to greet us; not less  than ten thousand children were shouting \"Viva la Amerique\". The whole  city was decorated with American and French flags intertwined. The crowd  lined upon the wharf so thickly we could scarcely pass through it. This  reception was the greatest we had received anywhere in France. We  visited the Hotel de Ville and were greeted by the mayor, with a  response by Mr. Nichols, interpreted by Dr. Mailloux. We were then taken  to the Hotel Regina and in the evening given a banquet by the Chamber of  Commerce. This chamber was organized in 1599 and is the oldest chamber  of commerce in the world.    Our invitation to this banquet read as follows:    * * *    The President of the Marseilles Chamber of Commerce begs you to  honor him by your presence at the luncheon which will be given to  the members of your Commission on    Monday, September 25th 12:30 P. M. at the  Restaurant de la Re'serve.  (31 F Promenade de la Corniche)    * * *    At this banquet, on my right sat Maurice Damour, French deputy in charge  of the Commission, and on my left Hubert Giraud, vice-president of the  Chamber of Commerce. He made a fine address and I asked him for a copy,  which he gave me. It is reproduced herewith:    * * *    Mr. President--  Gentlemen:    I am desired by my President to give you in your own language the  welcome of the Chamber of Commerce of Marseilles. You will  certainly lose more than gain in hearing me instead of President"]]]
