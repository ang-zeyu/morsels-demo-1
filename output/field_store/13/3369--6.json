Moreover, though you find fault  with me, allow me to observe that I have had only one letter from you,  though you had greater leisure for writing, and more opportunity of  sending letters.    As to what you say in your letter, \"Even if anyone is inclined to be  offended with you, I ought to bring him to a better mind\"--I understand  to what you allude, and I have not neglected the matter. But the truth  is that the extent of his displeasure is something surprising. However,  I have not omitted to say anything there was to say in your behalf: but  on what points I am to hold out your wishes, I consider, ought to be my  guide. If you will write me word distinctly what they are, you will find  that I have had no desire to be more exacting, and in the future shall  be no more yielding, than you wish.[26]    As to the business of Tadius. He tells me that you have written him word  that there was no need of farther trouble, since the property is secured  by prescription. I am surprised that you do not know that in the case of  a statutory wardship of an unmarried girl prescription cannot be  pleaded.[27]    I am glad you like your purchase in Epirus. What I commissioned you to  get for me, and anything you see suitable to my Tusculan villa, I should  be glad if you will, as you say in your letter, procure for me, only  don't put yourself to any inconvenience. The truth is, there is no other  place that gives me complete rest after all my worries and hard work.    I am expecting my brother Quintus every day. Terentia has a severe  attack of rheumatism. She is devoted to you, to your sister, and your  mother, and adds her kindest regards in a postscript. So does my pet  Tulliola. Love me, and be assured that I love you as a brother.    [Footnote 23: Pomponia, married to Cicero's younger brother Quintus. We  shall frequently hear of this unfortunate marriage. Quintus was four  years younger than his brother, who had apparently arranged the match,  and felt therefore perhaps somewhat responsible for the result (Nep.  _Att._ 5).]    [Footnote 24: Atticus had estates and a villa near Buthrotum in  Epirus,--_Butrinto_ in Albania, opposite Corfu.]    [Footnote 25: This is probably Sext. Peducaeus the younger, an intimate  friend of Atticus (Nep. _Att._ 21); his father had been praetor in Sicily  when Cicero was quaestor (B.C. 76-75), the son was afterwards a partisan  of Caesar in the Civil War, governor of Sardinia, B.C. 48, and propraetor  in Spain, B.C. 39.]    [Footnote 26: The person alluded to is L. Lucceius, of whom we shall  hear again. See Letters V, VII, VIII, CVIII. What his quarrel with  Atticus was about, we do not know.]    [Footnote 27: Prescriptive right to property was acquired by possession  (_usus_) of two years. But no such right could be acquired to the  property of a girl under guardianship (_pro Flacco_, Sec. 84).]          II (A I, 6)    TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)    ROME, DECEMBER      [Sidenote: B.C. 68, AET. 38]    I won't give you any excuse hereafter for accusing me of neglecting to  write. It is you that must take care that with all your leisure you keep  up with me.    Rabirius's house at Naples,[28]for the improvement of which you have  designs drawn out and completed in imagination, has been bought by M.  Fonteius[29] for 130,000 sesterces (about L1,040). I wished you to know  this in case you were still hankering after it.    We may be quite satisfied, I think, with my brother's feelings towards  Pomponia. He is with her at present in his villa at Arpinum, and has  Decimus Turanius with him, who is great in _belles lettres_.    The date of my father's death was the 28th of November.    That is about all my news. If you light on any articles of _vertu_  suitable for a gymnasium, which would look well in the place you wot  of,[30] please don't let them slip. I am so delighted with my Tusculan  villa that I never feel really happy till I get there. Let me know  exactly what you are doing and intending to do about everything.    [Footnote 28: C. Rabirius, whom Cicero defended in B.C. 63, when  prosecuted by Caesar for his share in the murder of Saturninus (B.C.  100). He lived, we know, in Campania, for his neighbours came to give  evidence in his favour at the trial.]    [Footnote 29: M. Fonteius made a fortune in the province of Gaul beyond  the Alps, of which he was propraetor, B.C. 77-74. In B.C. 69 he had been  accused of malversation, and defended by Cicero. After his acquittal he  seems to be buying a seaside residence in Campania, as so many of the  men of fashion did.]    [Footnote 30: Cicero's \"gymnasium\" was some arrangement of buildings and  plantations more or less on the model of the Greek gymnasia, at his  Tusculan villa.]          III (A I, 7)    TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)    ROME, DECEMBER      [Sidenote: B.C. 68, AET. 38]    All's well at your mother's,[31] and I keep an eye on her. I have  undertaken to pay L. Cincius 20,400 sesterces[32] to your credit on the  Ides of February. Pray see that I receive at the earliest possible  opportunity what you say in your letters that you have bought and  secured for me. I should also be very much obliged if you would, as you  promised, think over the means of securing the library for me. My hope  of getting the one enjoyment which I care for, when I come to retire,  depends entirely on your kindness.    [Footnote 31: The mother of Atticus lived to be ninety, dying in B.C.  33, not long before Atticus himself, who at her funeral declared that  \"he had never been reconciled to her, for he had never had a word of  dispute with her\" (Nep. _Att._ 17).]    [Footnote 32: This sum (about L163) is for the works of art purchased  for the writer by Atticus.]          IV (A I, 9)      [Sidenote: B.C. 67.

It is the year       also of Pompey's great commission by the _lex Gabinia_ against the       Pirates. But Cicero does not seem as yet much concerned with       \"foreign politics.\"      TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)    ROME    [Sidenote: B.C. 67, AET. 39]    I get letters from you far too seldom considering that you can much more  easily find people starting for Rome than I to Athens: considering, too,  that you are more certain of my being at Rome than I of your being at  Athens. For instance, it is owing to this uncertainty on my part that  this very letter is somewhat short, because not being sure as to where  you are, I don't choose my confidential talk to fall into strange hands.  The Megaric statues and the Hermae, which you mentioned in your letters,  I am waiting for impatiently. Anything you have of the same kind which  may strike you as worthy of my \"Academia,\" do not hesitate to send, and  have complete confidence in my money-chest. My present delight is to  pick up anything particularly suitable to a \"gymnasium.\" Lentulus  promises the use of his ships. I beg you to be zealous in these matters.  Thyillus begs you (and I also at his request) to get him some writings  of the Eumolpidae.[33]          V (A I, 8)    TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)    ROME      [Sidenote: B.C. 67, AET. 39]    All well at your house. Your mother and sister are regarded with  affection by me and my brother Quintus. I have spoken to Acutilius. He  says that he has not heard from his agent, and professes surprise that  you should make any difficulty of his having refused to guarantee you  against farther demands. As to the business of Tadius, the announcement  in your letter that you have settled the matter out of court I saw  gratified and pleased him very much. That friend of mine[34]--a most  excellent man, upon my honour, and most warmly attached to me--is very  angry with you. If I could but know how much you care about it, I should  be able to decide how much trouble I am to take in the matter. I have  paid L. Cincius the 20,400 sesterces for the Megaric statues in  accordance with your letter to me. As to your Hermae of Pentelic marble  with bronze heads, about which you wrote to me--I have fallen in love  with them on the spot. So pray send both them and the statues, and  anything else that may appear to you to suit the place you wot of, my  passion, and your taste--as large a supply and as early as possible.  Above all, anything you think appropriate to a gymnasium and terrace. I  have such a passion for things of this sort that while I expect  assistance from you, I must expect something like rebuke from others. If  Lentulus has no vessel there, put them on board anyone you please. My  pet Tulliola claims your present and duns me as your security. I am  resolved, however, to disown the obligation rather than pay up for you.    [Footnote 33: Thyillus (sometimes written Chilius), a Greek poet living  at Rome. See Letters XVI and XXI.

The result is that, though I do send _an_ answer, I am forced  by the shortness of the time to write only these few words. First, as to  softening my friend's feeling towards you, or even reconciling him  outright, I pledge you my word to do so.

CHAPTER VI    A LION DRIVE. WITH A RHINO IN RANGE SOME ONE SHOUTS \"SIMBA\" AND I GET MY  FIRST GLIMPSE OF A WILD LION. THREE SHOTS AND OUT      Like every one who goes to Africa with a gun and a return ticket, I had  two absorbing ambitions. One was to kill a lion and the other to live to  tell about it. In my estimation all the other animals compared to a lion  as latitude eighty-seven and a half compares to the north pole. I wanted  to climb out of the Tartarin of Tarascon class of near lion hunters into  the ranks of those who are entitled to remark, \"Once, when I was in  Africa shooting lions,\" etc. A dead lion is bogey in the big game  sport--the score that every hunter dreams of achieving--and I was  extremely eager to make the dream a reality.    When speaking with English sportsmen in London my first question was,  \"Did you get any lions?\" If they had, they at once rose in my  estimation; if not, no matter how many elephants or rhinos or buffaloes  they may have shot, they still remained in the amateur class.    On the steamer going down to Mombasa the hunting talk was four-fifths  lion and one-fifth about other game. The cripple who had been badly  mauled by a lion was a person of much distinction, even more so than the  ivory hunter who had killed three hundred elephants.    [Photograph: By courtesy of W.D. Boyce. Mr. Stephenson's Lion]    [Photograph: A Post Mortem Inquiry]    On the railway to Nairobi every eye was on the lookout for lions and  every one gazed with intense interest at the station of Tsavo and  remembered the famous pair of man-eaters that had terrorized that place  some years before.    In Nairobi the men who had killed lions, and those who had been mauled  by them (and there are many of the latter), were objects of vast  concern, and the little cemetery with its many headstones marked \"Killed  by lion\" added still greater fire to my interest.    [Drawing: _The Jolly Little Cemetery_]    Consequently, when we marched out of Nairobi on the evening of September  twenty-third, with tents and guns and a hundred and twenty men, the  dominating thought was of lions. If ever any one had greater hope and  less expectation of killing a lion I was the one.    We had planned a short trip of from three to five weeks northeast of  Nairobi in what is called the Tana River country. While there are some  lions in that section, as there are in most parts of British East  Africa, it is not considered a good lion country. Buffaloes, rhinos,  hippos, giraffes, and many varieties of smaller game are abundant,  largely because the Tana River is in a bad fever belt and hunting  parties generally prefer to go elsewhere. This preliminary trip was  intended to perfect our shooting, so that later, when in real lion  country, we might be better equipped to take on the king of beasts with  some promise of hitting him.    [Drawing: _Peering for Lions_]    The tree-tops and corrugated iron roofs of Nairobi had hardly dropped  behind a long, sun-soaked hump of the Athi Plains when I began to peel  my eyes inquiringly for lions. All the lion stories that I had heard for  the preceding few months paraded back and forth in my memory, and if  ever a horizon was thoroughly scanned for lion, that horizon just out of  Nairobi was the one. Hartebeests in droves loped awkwardly away from the  trail and then turned and looked with wondering interest at us. Zebras,  too fat to run, trotted off, and also turned to observe the invaders.  Gazelles did the same, and away off in the distance a few wildebeests  went galloping slowly to a safe distance. They were probably safe at any  distance had they only known it, for up to the hour when I cantered  forth from Nairobi in quest of lions and rhinos I had not shot at  anything for three years, nor hit anything for ten.    Night came on--the black, sudden night of Africa--and we went into camp  four miles from Nairobi without ever having heard the welcome roar of a  lion. It was a distinct disappointment. I remembered the story about the  lions that stampeded the zebras through the peaceful gardens of Nairobi  only a few nights before--also the report that some man-eaters had been  recently partaking of nourishment along the very road upon which we were  now camping. I also remembered hearing that lions had been seen prowling  around the edge of the town and that the Athi Plains are a time-honored  habitat of the lion family. On the other hand, I thought of Mr.  Roosevelt, who had recently been reducing the supply. I also remembered  how many hunters had spent years in Africa without ever seeing a lion,  and how Doctor Rainsford had made two different hunting trips to Africa,  always looking for lions, but without success.    During our first three days of marching, we looked industriously for  lions. On broad, grassy plain, in low scrub, on the slopes of low  hills--everywhere we looked for them. If a flock of vultures circled  above a distant spot we went over at once in the hope of surprising a  lion at his kill. Every reed bed was promptly investigated, every dry  nullah was explored. McMillan's farm, which is a farm only in name, was  scoured without ever a sign or a hint that a lion lurked thereabouts.  Mr. McMillan has four lions in a cage, but they snarled so savagely that  we hastened away to look for lions elsewhere. The second day we crossed  the Nairobi River, the third day we crossed the Induruga River, and the  fourth day we camped down on the Athi River. Here we struck a clue. Two  English settlers came over and told us that lions had been heard the  night before near their ranch house, on the slopes of Donyo Sabuk, a  high solitary round top mountain rising from the Athi Plains, and we  determined to organize our first lion hunt. It was here that Mr. Lucas  was killed by a lion a short time before.    A lion hunt, or a lion drive, is quite a ceremony. You take thirty or  forty natives, go to the place where the lion was heard, and then beat  every bit of cover in the hope of scaring out the beasts. Lions are fond  of lying up during the day in dry reed beds, and when you go out looking  for them, you are most likely to find them in such places.    [Photograph: Mr. Stephenson's Splendid Buffalo]    [Photograph: \"Lion Camp\"]    [Photograph: The Lion and Lioness in Camp]    We started, three of us, with forty porters, at about daybreak. At seven  o'clock we had climbed up the side of the mountain to the spot where the  lions were supposed to be lurking--a long, reed-filled cleft in the side  of the slope. The porters were sent up to one end of the reed bed,  twenty on each side, while we went below to where the lion would  probably be driven out by their shouting and noise. The porters  bombarded the reeds with stones while we waited with rifles ready for  the angry creature to dash out in our vicinity. It was an interesting  wait, with plenty of food for thought. I wondered why the Englishmen had  not come out to get the lions themselves, and then remembered that one  of them had been mauled by a lion and had henceforth remained neutral in  all lion fights. I wondered many other things which I have now  forgotten. I was quite busy wondering for some time as I waited. In the  meantime the lions failed to appear.    Bushbuck, waterbuck, and lots of other herbivora appeared, but no  carnivora. We raked the reed bed fore and aft, and combed the long grass  in every direction. A young rhino was startled in his morning nap, ran  around excitedly for a while, and then trotted off. Birds of many  varieties fluttered up and wondered what the racket was about. At ten  o'clock we decided that the lions had failed to do their part of the  program, and that no further developments were to be expected. So we  marched back homeward, got mixed up with another rhino, and finally  gained camp, seven miles away, just as our hunger had reached an  advanced stage.    The next day we marched to the Thika Thika River, then to Punda Milia,  and then to Fort Hall. Some one claimed to have heard a lion out from  Fort Hall early in the morning, but I more than half suspect it was one  of our porters who reverberates when he sleeps. From Fort Hall we  crossed the Tana and made three marches down the river. Rhinos were  everywhere jumping out from behind bushes when least expected and in  many ways behaving in a most diverting way. For a time we forgot lions  while dodging rhinos. There were dozens of them in the thick, low scrub,  with now and then a bunch of eland, or a herd of waterbuck, or a few  hundred of the ubiquitous kongoni.    We camped in a beautiful spot down on the Tana. The country looked like  a park, with graceful trees scattered about on the rolling lawn-like  hills. On all sides was game in great profusion. Hippos played about in  the river, baboons scampered about on the edge of the water, monkeys  chattered in the trees, and it seemed as though nearly all of the eight  hundred varieties of East African birds gave us a morning serenade. A  five-minutes' walk from camp would show you a rhino, while from the top  of any knoll one could look across a vast sweep of hills upon which  almost countless numbers of zebras, kongoni, and other animals might be  seen.    But never a lion. It certainly looked discouraging.    As a form of pleasant excitement, we began to photograph rhinos, Mr.  Akeley took out his moving-picture machine, advanced it cautiously to  within a few yards of the unsuspecting rhino, and then we tried to  provoke a charge. We took a dozen or more rhinos in this way, often  approaching to within a few yards, and if there is any more exciting "]]]
