The  Austrians followed, raised the siege of Przemysl, and drove the  invaders from Hungary and straightened out their line from Sandomir to  Czernowitz.    Meanwhile heavy Russian reinforcements had been brought up from  Ivangorod and were gradually put in action against the Germans east of  Radom. On Oct. 24, as soon as the Russian superiority became alarming,  the four German army corps, having, temporarily at least, accomplished  their purpose of re-establishing the Austrian campaign, beat a hasty  retreat toward Silesia, during which the second purpose of their  invasion, to draw into the Polish bag great masses of Russian troops,  was successfully achieved, the Russians having been led to believe  that they were pursuing a great German army.    Simultaneously, though, with their advance in the path of the German  retreat in Poland, the Russians once more concentrated vast forces  against the menacing projection of the Austrian battleline in Galicia,  and the early days of November witnessed the second invasion of the  Austrian province. At the same time a new drive was made on East  Prussia, and the Germans were forced back into the region of the  Masurian Lakes.    The retirement of the entire Teutonic battleline before the Russians,  who toward the end of October had reached the maximum of their  strength, marks the end of the first phase of the eastern campaign. It  had not accomplished all that had been expected of it. The enemy had  been drawn far into South Poland, but the base of operations for the  general offensive against his communications in the north had not been  established just where it should have been, and the Russian frontier  fortifications had been found better prepared for resistance than  those of Belgium, while in the south the Austrian base of operations  was entirely in the hands of the enemy.    The second phase of the eastern campaign was therefore opened from a  new base--Thorn, where the main army had been gathered ever since Oct.  27, when the Russian danger had become alarming, and the offensive in  the west had been abandoned. It was suddenly launched with  irresistible force on Nov. 12, and rolled back numerically inferior  Russian armies, whose task it had been to protect the right flank of  the Russian advance on Silesia.    Recognizing the danger to their operations in South Poland and  Galicia, where they had meanwhile approached the line of the Warta,  Cracow, and Neu Sandec, the Russians threw troops into North Poland  from all sides and succeeded in temporarily detaining the German  advance there, while they were continuing their supreme efforts to  break the Austro-German line south of Cracow. But the line held. At  the same time the German drive in North Poland was making steady  headway.    On Dec. 6 the Germans took Lodz, and further north advanced on Lowitz,  and the Russian offensive in the Cracow district was given up. While  all troops that could be spared were sent northeast to support the  prepared lines of the Bzura and Rawka Rivers, the Russians in the  south fell back behind the Nida and Dunajec, joining with their right  wing their northern army in the region of Tomaschew, and extending  their left through the region of Gorlitz and Torka toward the Pruth.  In this line the Teutonic advance was checked. A new German drive on  the road from Soldau to Warsaw could likewise make no headway beyond  Mlawa, while on the other hand in East Prussia the Russian offensive  had been brought to a standstill.    A siege warfare, like that in France, seemed imminent, except in the  Bukowina, where Russian forces during January were driving Austrian  troops before them. The Russian invasion of that province, however,  so distant from all strategically important points, was but a  political manoeuvre.    The first movement of any consequence to occur was a desperate attempt  of the Austrians early in February to push forward with their right  wing in the direction of Stanislau, chiefly to bring relief to the  garrison of Przemysl. Simultaneously they began sweeping the Russians  out of Bukovina. The latter undertaking was successful, but the  advance on Stanislau was thrown back toward Nadworna.    While the Austrian offensive was under way, General von Hindenburg  unexpectedly launched a vigorous attack in East Prussia, which  resulted in the destruction of the Russian East Prussian Army in the  region of the Masurian Lakes. Once more a successful drive at the  Russian \"bread line\" from the north seemed at hand. Already the armies  pursuing the Russians were hammering at the Russian fortifications  along the Niemen, Bobr, and Narew when the surrender of Przemysl, the  siege of which had uninterruptedly gone on behind the Russian lines  since November, on March 22 again presented to the Russians an  opportunity to break the Austrian battleline.    To check the onslaught of the reinforced Russian armies against the  Carpathian passes early in April, troops must be drawn from General  von Hindenberg's armies, and the consequence was another deadlock in  the north. Meanwhile the reinforced Teutonic troops were hurriedly  concentrated for the counter-attack against the Russian offensive in  the Carpathians, and a great drive began against the Russian positions  on the Dunajec line, east of Cracow, early in May. Breaking all  resistance, it swept on toward Jaroslau and Przemysl on a sixty-mile  front.    Threatened in their right and left flanks, respectively, the Russian  lines on the Nida and in the Carpathians fell back rapidly, while  reinforcements were sent to stem the Teutonic advance along the San.  But the Russian efforts were in vain. The momentum the Teutonic  offensive had gained carried it across the river, while further south  the Austrian right wing cleared the entire Carpathian front of the  enemy, hotly pushing his retreat.    Przemysl was recaptured, the third Russian line of defense from  Rawa-Ruska to Grodeck and the Dniester was broken, and the end of June  saw Lemberg once more in the hands of the Teutons, and the Russian  line on the defensive and sorely pressed along a front extending from  the Bessarabian frontier along the Dniester to the mouth of the  Zlota-Lipa, and from there along the Zlota-Lipa and the Bug, well into  Russian territory, leaving the river southeast of Grubeschow, and  continuing from there in a northwesterly direction to the region of  Krasnik.    Here it joined hands with the left wing of the Russian Army of the  Nida, which had retired before the Austro-German advance in a  northeasterly direction, intrenching along a line from Krasnik across  the Vistula and through Sjenno and Jastrshob (about fifteen miles  southwest of Radom) to the region of Tomaschew on the Pilitza.    While this great Spring offensive from the Dunajec line was well under  way, small German forces invaded the Russian province of Courland.  Finding at first little resistance in the path of their unexpected  advance, they took Libau and established themselves on the  Dubissa-Windau line. During July the operations in Courland steadily  assumed greater proportions.    Two bases for the campaign against the Russian lines of communication  have thus been firmly established in the flanks of the Russian Armies  west of the Vistula, both protruding far into their rear. Drives  against the Dunaburg-Warsaw line from the north and the  Minsk-Ivangorod line from the south will open the second year of the  eastern campaign. The first year of the incessant struggle has brought  the aims of the German strategy, the bagging of the Russian Armies,  within sight of its realization.    III.    CAMPAIGNS OF MINOR IMPORTANCE    While the struggle in the two principal seats of war has been going  on, the passing year has witnessed fighting also of secondary  importance, though not less heroic, in three other fields of action:  Serbia, Turkey, and the Austro-Italian frontier. Whereas Turkey joined  the Teutons but three months after the beginning of hostilities, and  Italy was involved only at the end of May, Serbia was one of the first  nations to take the field.    Austria's campaign against the little kingdom could under no  circumstances influence the events of the war, and was therefore void  of any strategic importance. For this reason, but three Austrian Army  corps were engaged in it.    The purpose was merely to keep the Serbians busy, and prevent them  from invading Austrian soil. For the sake of the moral effect on the  other Balkan States the capture of Belgrade should be attempted. In  view of the strength of the Danube fortifications the operations were  launched from Bosnia and resulted in the forcing of the Drina line and  the capture of Valjevo on Nov. 17. The Serbian positions on the Danube  having thus been flanked, the abandonment of Belgrade on Dec. 2 was a  natural consequence of the Battle of Valjevo.    Misled by their successes into the belief that the Serbian army had  been placed hors de combat, the Austrians advanced beyond the lines  destined to constitute the object of their offensive. In the difficult  mountain districts southeast of Valjevo the Serbians turned on the  invaders with superior forces and defeated them. The Austrian retreat  to the Drina which followed, necessitated the evacuation of Belgrade  on Dec. 15. Since then, the situation on the Serbian frontier has been  a deadlock, only desultory and insignificant fighting occurring for  the rest of the year.    In contrast to the operations in Serbia, Turkey's campaign has direct  bearing on the European war. Its chief feature, the closing of the  Dardanelles, has been a serious blow to Russia. The frantic efforts of  the Allies to open them are the plainest evidence of its importance.    The attempt in March to force the straits by naval power having  resulted in failure, an army was landed on the west coast of  Gallipoli, and after heavy fighting "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22483"],[0,"Across Unknown South America (#11)"],[1,"boundary of the  State of Sao Paulo with the State of Minas Geraes. As we got near the  river a greater lack of cultivation was noticeable, with more extensive  zones of wooded country, especially in the depressions of the land. The  undulations of the landscape were more accentuated as we approached the  Minas Geraes province. Clouds hung low in the valleys, and we  occasionally went through banks of mist not unlike those of Scotland. At  Chapadao the ground was more \"_accidente_\"--to use an appropriate French  expression--with deep depressions and indentations in the surface soil  caused by erosion.    The high land on which we had been travelling between Franca and Igacaba,  the station after Chapadao, gave birth on the west to several important  tributaries of the Rio Grande, enumerated below, from south to north; the  Rio Salgado, the Rio do Carmo, Riberao Ponte Nova, Rib. Bandeira, Rio da  Soledade, Rib. S. Pedro; on the east was the Rib. S. Jesus, also a  tributary of the Rio Grande.    As the train sped down the incline towards the Rio Grande we were now  treated to magnificent scenery on our right. An isolated hill stood at  the bottom of the valley with higher mountains on either side of it, and,  beyond, a high flat-topped plateau. The railway line skirted snake-like  along the hill-side. The hill-tops were getting more rounded and fairly  thickly wooded. As we got to a lower elevation the isolated hill assumed  the appearance of an elephant's back. A grassy valley several miles wide  opened up before us.    At Rifaina Station we had reached the level of the banks of the Rio  Grande, that is to say, 1,950 ft. above the sea level. The valley of the  river was formed, in this case also, by erosion which had left isolated  hills in terraces, one with as many as six distinct terraces, others with  rounded backs, but all plainly showing in their stratification, which was  identical with that of the surrounding elevations, that in former days  there stood, where the valley was now, a plateau which had subsequently  been gradually eroded by the action of water and wind.    Having crossed the river, we arrived at Jaguara--we were now travelling  in the Minas Geraes Province--where a breakfast awaited us of rice, pork,  dried beef, as hard as leather, omelette with shrimps (a much cherished  dish in those parts), beans, mandioca, and coffee. Black railway porters,  firemen and engine drivers all sat round the table and ate heartily, the  meal costing 2 milreis, or about 2_s._ 8_d._    The railway ran almost parallel with the river on the north side round  the immense curve which the Rio Grande describes in that particular  section. We passed Sacramento (elev. 1,850 ft.), and, in numerous curves,  the railway rose by a gradient of 31/2 per cent among hills seemingly worn  out by torrential rains into rounded shapes with huge gaps between. We  left the Rio Grande, there about 100 yards wide with thickly wooded banks  and islands. At Conquista we had already again reached an elevation of  2,350 ft., but we still continued to rise by a gradient of 21/2 to 3 per  cent, until a pass was reached from which two exquisite panoramas were  obtained. One, particularly interesting, looked over Conquista with its  whitewashed houses--some 250 of them--and red-tiled roofs against the  background formed by the rugged sides of the natural cauldron worn in the  tableland by erosion.    At 538 kil., 2,700 ft. above the sea level, a view was obtained of a  small coffee plantation, but most of the country around was scantily  wooded, grassy in places, barren in others.    The railway, having descended to 2,500 ft., rose again to 2,900 ft. near  Paneiras Station. Then, through beautiful grazing country, gently  undulating, we descended and mounted and went round sweeping curves,  which formed in places regular loops not unlike a horseshoe. Two pits  producing a considerable quantity of lime existed some 2 kil. from  Paneiras. Weak attempts were noticeable here and there at growing coffee.  We were now in an eminently wonderful pasture land--getting more and more  beautiful as we neared Uberaba, where we found ourselves on almost flat  country at an elevation of 2,900 ft., with hardly any trees at all and  with a delicious climate. The town of Uberaba, with some 12,000 people,  was situated at a slightly lower elevation--only 2,700 ft.    [Illustration: The Station and Shed of the Goyaz Railway, Araguary.    Mr. Luiz Schnoor and his two engineers.]    [Illustration: Typical Trees of the Brazilian Forest, Goyaz.    The stem devoid of branches and foliage up to a great height.]    Uberaba was perhaps the most important distributing centre in the western  part of Minas Geraes, for many trails branched from that place to various  distant points in the farther interior. The most important trail was the  one to Sta. Rita do Paranahyba, thence to the capital of Goyaz Province  via Marrinhos and Allemao; whence a second trail went to Fructal via  Conceicao das Alagaos; a third, to Sant' Anna do Paranahyba, going on the  whole almost due west, but with great deviations, went almost across  South America as far as Pulacayo, in Bolivia, crossing first the State of  Matto Grosso in its southern and narrower point via Coxim and Corumba,  then all Bolivia, eventually joining the La Paz-Antofagasta Railway line  at Uyum (Pulacayo is connected by rail to Uyum), and ending at the  Pacific Ocean. Another trail led to Monte Alegre; yet another to  Uberabinha--although the railway had already connected that town with  Uberaba. This last trail continued, making great detours, to Bagagem,  then to Patrocino, from which place it deviated due north to Paracatu,  where three ramifications occurred: one to Sta. Lucia, Pyrinopolis, and  Goyaz (capital); the second to Jamarria, Jocare (on the San Francisco  River), and Carrinhan (on the Carinhaha River, a tributary of the San  Francisco), and eventually by water to the Atlantic Ocean; the third  trail proceeded due east--across the S. Francisco River to Montes Claros  and Grao Mogol; a fourth in a south-easterly direction led to Curvelho  and Sta. Lucia, where it met the railway to Rio de Janeiro. Another route  proceeded south to Sta. Rita do Paraiso.    The price of land--which was excellent in the valley of the river--in the  vicinity of Uberaba was from 30 to 150 milreis per alqueire--each  alqueire being reckoned at 10,000 square bracas, and a braca being about  61/2 ft., or a little over two metres.    After leaving Uberaba the scenery was magnificent, especially when a  storm approached as we were steaming over the Serra de Caracol. Dense  black clouds collected and capped the dark green forest of the Serra,  while down, down below on our right the endless gently undulating plain  of fresh green grass was brilliantly illuminated by a warm dazzling sun.  Most beautiful grazing land--practically going to waste now--we crossed  on reaching the highest point of the Serra; grass, grass, as far as the  eye could see--quite flat land--but not a head of cattle in sight; in  fact, no sign of animal life, and a stillness of death except for the  puffing of the railway engine on which I sat. Water, however, did not  seem to abound--only a small stream, near which curious-looking patches,  or _bosquets_ of trees lay in dark spots on that light green expanse. We  were then at an elevation of 3,400 ft., amid delightfully cool and crisp  air.    At Burity passed the great route of the cattle dealers from Goyaz and  Matto Grosso for Sta. Rita, Passos, and Tres Coracoes do Rio Verde. At  Palestina (845 kil. from the sea) we were on what seemed an interminable  flat plateau with ideally green grass, and here and there patches of  stunted vegetation. Land could be purchased there as low as 10 milreis an  alqueire, although the best land cost from 50 to 300 milreis.    All was absolutely flat until we reached Sicupira (elev. 3,100 ft. above  the sea level), where we began to descend to the Rio Uberabinha, its  delightfully clear crystalline water winding its way through scrub.    At Uberabinha we again came across the wonderful red earth of the Riberao  Preto district. Situated at an elevation of 3,050 ft. stood the little  town of some 4,000 inhabitants, about 500 yards from the comfortable and  pretty station. Although the land was beautiful, cultivation could not be  said to be prevalent. Merely some rice, beans, and Indian corn were grown  in small quantities.    From Uberabinha the railway line descended all the time through thinly  wooded country of shrubs and stunted trees; the verdant prairies, so  refreshing to the eyes, were left behind, and the country became more  broken, but the land was still excellent for agricultural purposes. After  crossing a well-constructed iron bridge resting on two masonry pillars  and spanning the picturesque rapids of the Rio das Velhas--the river,  with its turbid, muddy, nasty-looking water, being there some 80 yards  wide, at an elevation of 2,050 ft. above the sea level--we again began a  steep ascent by a gradient of over 3 per cent, following most of the time  the river course. The thickly wooded banks obstructed a good deal of the  view except here and there, where a charming glimpse of the water could  be obtained.    Seven hundred and eighty-nine kilometres from Campinas--or 982 kil. from  the Atlantic Ocean at Santos--we arrived at the terminal station of the  Mogyana Railway at a place called Araguary, 3,150 ft. above the sea  level--one of the dirtiest and most unpleasant spots on the face of the  earth. The termini of railway lines in newly developed countries seem to  act like filters. Whatever is good passes through; only the impurities or  dregs remain.
