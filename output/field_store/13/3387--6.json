We fight  like lions.  I knock seven men down, one before the tother, 'cause of  bein' very strong, an' had learn to spar a littil.  You know how to  spar?\"    \"Well,\" returned Ted, looking with a smile at his huge hands, \"I can't  go for to say as I know much about the science of it, d'ee see; but I  can use my fists after a fashion.\"    \"Good,\" continued the Moor.  \"Well, then, we fights till all our eyes is  black, an' all our noses is red, an' some of our teeths is out, but the  sailirs wos too many for us.  We wos 'bleeged to gif in, for wot kin  courage do agin numbers? so we wos took aboord a friggit and 'zamined.\"    \"An' what?\" asked the seaman.    \"'Zamined.  Overhauled,\" replied the Moor.    \"Oh! examined, I see.  Well?\"    \"Well, I feels sure of git hoff, bein' a Algerine Moor, so w'en my turn  comes, I says to the hofficer wot 'zamined us, says I, `I's not a  Breetish man!'    \"`Wot are you, then?' says the hofficer.    \"`I's a Moor,' says I.    \"`Moor's the pity,' says he.\"    Ted gave a short laugh at this.    \"Now, that's strange,\" observed Ali, glancing at his companion in some  surprise; \"that's 'zactly wot they all did, w'en the hofficer says that!  I've thought oftin 'bout it since, but never could see wot they laugh  at.\"    \"Oh, it's just a way we've got,\" returned Flaggan, resuming his gravity;  \"the English have a knack o' larfin', off and on, w'en they shouldn't  ought to.--Git along with your yarn.\"    \"Well, that wos the finish.  I became a Breetish tar, an' fouted in all  the battils of the navy.  I 'spected to get promotion an' prize-money,  but nivir git none, 'cause of circumstances as wos never 'splained to  me.  Well, one night we come in our friggit to anchor in bay of Algiers.  I gits leave go ashore wi' tothers, runs right away to our Dey, who  gits awrful waxy, sends for Breetish cap'n, 'splain that I's the son of  a Turk by a Algerine moder an' wery nigh or'er the cap'n's head to be  cutted off.\"    \"You don't say so?\"    \"Yis, it's troo.  Wery near declare war with England acause of that,\"  said Ali, with an air of importance.  \"But the Breetish consul he  interfere, goes down on hims knees, an' beg the Dey for to parding hims  nation.\"    \"He must ha' bin a cowardly feller, that consul!\"    \"No,\" said the interpreter sternly, \"him's not coward.  Him was my  master, Kurnil Langley, an' only do the right ting: humbil hisself to  our Dey w'en hims contry do wrong.--Now, here we is comin' to  Bab-el-Oued, that means the Water-gate in yoor lingo, w'ere the peepils  hold palaver.\"    This in truth appeared to be the case, for many of the chief men of the  city were seated under and near the gate, as the two drew near, smoking  their pipes and gossiping in the orthodox Eastern style.    The big Irishman attracted a good deal of notice as he passed through  the gates; but Turks are grave and polite by nature: no one interrupted  him or made audible comments upon his somewhat wild and unusual  appearance.    Passing onwards, they entered the town and traversed the main street  towards the Bab-Azoun gate, which Ali explained to his companion was the  Gate of Tears, and the place of public execution.    Here they came suddenly on the body of a man, the feet and limbs of  which were dreadfully mangled, showing that the miserable wretch had  perished under the bastinado.    At the time we write of, and indeed at all times during Turkish rule,  human life was held very cheap.  For the slightest offences, or  sometimes at the mere caprice of those in power, men were taken up and  bastinadoed in the open streets until they died from sheer agony, and  their relations did not dare to remove the bodies for burial until their  tyrants had left the scene.  Cruelty became almost the second nature of  the people.  Theft was checked by the amputation of the first joint of  the fore-finger of the right hand for the first offence.  For the  second, the whole hand was sacrificed, and for the third, the head  itself was forfeited.  Sometimes, in cases of capital punishment,  decapitation was performed by degrees! and other refinements too  horrible to mention were constantly practised.    While the interpreter was explaining to his companion as much of this as  he deemed it right for him to know, several of the sorrowing relations  of the dead man came forward and carried the body away.  Little notice  was taken of the incident, which, from beginning to end, scarcely  interrupted the general flow of business.    At the Bab-Azoun gate, which occupied a position not many yards distant  from the spot on which now stands the principal theatre of Algiers, Ali  left Ted Flaggan for a few minutes, begging him to wait until he had  transacted a piece of business in the market held just outside the gate.    \"Tell me before ye go, Ally, what may be the use of them three big hooks  close to the gate,\" said Flaggan, pointing upwards.    \"Them's for throwin' down teeves an' murderers on to.--You stay here; me  not be wery long come back.\"    Rais Ali hurried away, leaving the sailor to observe and moralise on all  that passed around him.  And there was a good deal to induce thought in  one who had been accustomed to comparatively humane laws and merciful  dispensations in his native land, for, besides the scene which he had  just witnessed, and the huge hooks whose uses had just been explained to  him, he now noticed that several conspicuous places near him were  garnished with the heads of malefactors who had been recently executed.  He observed, also, that the innumerable donkeys which were being  constantly driven past him, overladen with market produce, were covered  with open sores, and that these sores appeared to be selected for  special flagellation when the brutal drivers wished to urge the wretched  creatures on.    He stood thus for some time watching with interest the throng of Turks,  Jews, Moors, negroes, and others that continually streamed to and fro,  some on foot, some on horseback, and others, especially the men with  marketable commodities, on mules and donkeys.  It was not difficult for  him to distinguish between the races, for Rais Ali had already told him  that none but Turks were permitted to wear the turban, not even the sons  of Turks by Algerine mothers, and that the Jews were by law commanded to  dress in sombre black.    Suddenly he observed a body of men advancing towards the gate, carrying  something in their arms, and followed by an orderly crowd at a  respectful distance.  With the curiosity of an idler he approached, and  found that they bore a man, who was firmly bound hand and foot.  The man  was a Moor, and the anxious look of his pale face showed that he was  about to suffer punishment of some kind.    The seaman mingled with the crowd and looked on.    Laying the man on the ground with his face downwards, the officers of  justice sent away two of their number, who speedily returned with a  blacksmith's anvil and forehammer.  On this they placed one of their  victim's ankles, and Flaggan now saw, with a sickening heart, that they  were about to break it with the ponderous hammer.  One blow sufficed to  crush the bones in pieces, and drew from the man an appalling shriek of  agony.  Pushing his leg farther on the anvil, the executioner broke it  again at the shin, while the other officials held the yelling victim  down.  A third blow was then delivered on the knee, but the shriek that  followed was suddenly cut short in consequence of the man having  fainted.  Still the callous executioner went on with his horrible task,  and, breaking the leg once more at the thigh, proceeded to go through  the same process with the other leg, and also with the arms.  When  twelve blows had thus been delivered, the writhing of the wretched  victim proved that he was still alive, though his labouring chest was  now incapable of giving vent to his agony in shrieks.    We would not describe such a scene as this were it not certainly true;  and we relate it, reader, not for the purpose of harrowing your  feelings, but for the sake of showing what diabolical deeds we men are  capable of, unless guarded therefrom by the loving and tender _spirit_  of Jesus Christ.  We say \"spirit\" advisedly, for we are well aware that  false professors of that blessed name have, many a time, committed deeds  even more horrible than that which we have just described.    Unable to bear the sight longer, the sailor turned and hurried away from  the spot.    Fortunately he met Rais Ali just outside the crowd.    \"Come, lad, come,\" he cried, seizing that boastful man by the arm, in  such a grasp that Rais turned pale with alarm.  \"I can't stop here.  Let's git away.  Sure it's divls they must be, an' not men!\"    Blindly dragging the interpreter along by main force through several  streets, Flaggan stopped suddenly at last to recover breath and to wipe  the perspiration from his brow.    \"Don't ask me wot I've seen,\" he said, to Ali's inquiries, \"I can't  a-bear to think on it.  God help me!  I wish I could wipe it out of me  brain intirely.  Come along, let's finish our business, an' git out o'  this cursed place.\"    Proceeding rapidly and in silence towards the street at the base of the  triangular town, which followed the line of ramparts that faced the sea,  they discovered the great man of whom they were in search, Sidi Omar,  walking up and down with the cadi, or chief judge, to whose daughter he  was to be united on the following day.    \"It won't do to 'trupt 'em jus' yit.  Hold on a littil,\" said Rais Ali  to his companion.    Ted Flaggan had no objection to \"hold on,\" for the sight of the ocean  with its fresh breezes cooled his brow, and tended to turn his mind away  from the horrible thoughts that filled it.    While they are waiting, let you and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21699"],[0,"The Rover of the Andes: A Tale of Adventure on South America (#11)"],[1,"of the blast drowned the shout; but before the  snowdrift blinded him, Lawrence had observed the wave of the hand and  the anxious look.  Dashing the cruel Spanish spurs for the first time  into the side of his no doubt astonished steed, he sprang alongside of  Manuela's mule, seized the bridle, and dragged it forward by main force.  Of course the creature objected, but the steep road and slipping gravel  favoured them, so that they reached the bottom in safety.    Here they found the first of the refuge-huts, and in a few moments were  all safe within its sheltering walls.    Having been erected for a special purpose, the hut was well adapted to  resist the wildest storm.  It was built of brick and mortar, the  foundation being very solid, and about twelve feet high, with a brick  staircase outside leading to the doorway.  Thus the habitable part of  the edifice was raised well above the snow.  The room was about twelve  feet square, the floor of brick, and the roof arched.  It was a  dungeon-like place, dimly lighted by three loop-holes about six inches  square, and without furniture of any kind.  A mark in the wall indicated  the place where a small table had originally been fixed; but it had been  torn down long before, as Pedro explained, by imprisoned and starving  travellers to serve for firewood.  The remains of some pieces of charred  wood lay on the floor where the fire was usually kindled, and, to  Pedro's great satisfaction, they found a small pile of firewood which  had been left there by the last travellers.    \"A dismal enough place,\" remarked Lawrence, looking round after shaking  and stamping the snow out of his garments.    \"You have reason to thank God, senhor, that we have reached it.\"    \"True, Senhor Pedro, and I am not thankless; yet do I feel free to  repeat that it is a most dismal place.\"    \"Mos' horriboble,\" said Quashy, looking up at the vaulted roof.    \"Ay, and it could tell many a dismal story if it had a tongue,\" said the  guide, as he busied himself arranging the saddles and baggage, and  making other preparations to spend the night as comfortably as  circumstances should permit.  \"Luckily there's a door this time.\"    \"Is it sometimes without a door, then?\" asked Lawrence, as he assisted  in the arrangements, while Quashy set about kindling a fire.    \"Ay, the poor fellows who are sometimes stormstaid and starved here have  a tendency to use all they can find about the place for firewood.  Some  one has replaced the door, however, since I was here last.  You'll find  two big nails in the wall, Manuela,\" he added in Indian; \"if you tie one  of the baggage cords to them, I'll give you a rug directly, which will  make a good screen to cut off your sleeping berth from ours.\"    In a short time Quashy had a bright little fire burning, with the kettle  on it stuffed full of fresh snow; the saddles and their furniture made  comfortable seats and lounges around it; and soon a savoury smell of  cooked meat rendered the cold air fragrant, while the cheery blaze  dispelled the gloom and made a wonderful change in the spirits of all.  Perhaps we should except the guide, whose calm, grave, stern yet kindly  aspect rarely underwent much change, either in the way of elation or  depression, whatever the surrounding circumstances might be.  His  prevailing character reminded one of a rock, whether in the midst of a  calm or raging sea--or of a strong tower, whether surrounded by warring  elements or by profound calm.  Need we say that Pedro's imperturbability  was by no means the result of apathy?    \"Blow away till you bust your buzzum,\" said Quashy, apostrophising the  gale as he sat down with a beaming display of teeth and spread out his  hands before the blaze, after having advanced supper to a point which  admitted of a pause; \"I don' care a butt'n how hard you blow now.\"    \"Ah!  Quashy,\" said the guide, shaking his head slowly, as, seated on  his saddle, he rolled up a neat cigarette, \"don't be too confident.  You  little know what sights these four walls have witnessed.  True, this is  not quite the season when one runs much risk of being starved to death,  but the thing is not impossible.\"    \"Surely,\" said Lawrence, stretching himself on his saddle-cloths and  glancing at Manuela, who was by that time seated on the opposite side of  the fire arranging some hard biscuits on a plate, \"surely people have  not been starved to death here, have they?\"    \"Indeed they have--only too often, senhor.  I myself came once to this  hut to rescue a party, but was nearly too late, for most of them were  dead.\"    He paused to light his cigarette.  The negro, after making the door more  secure, sat down again and gazed at the guide with the glaring aspect of  a man who fears, but delights in, the horrible.  Manuela, letting her  clasped hands fall in her lap, also gazed at Pedro with the intense  earnestness that was habitual to her.  She seemed to listen.  Perhaps,  being unusually intelligent, she picked up some information from the  guide's expressive face.  She could hardly have learned much from his  speech, as her knowledge of English seemed to be little more than \"yes,\"  \"no,\" and \"t'ank you!\"    \"It was during a change of government, senhor,\" said Pedro, \"that I  chanced to be crossing the mountains.  There is usually a considerable  row in South America when a change of government takes place.  Sometimes  they cause a change of government to take place in order to get up a  considerable row, for they're a lively people--almost as fond of  fighting as the Irish, though scarcely so sound in judgment.  I had some  business on hand on the western side of the Cordillera, but turned back  to give a helping hand to my friends, for of course I try never to shirk  duty, though I'm not fond of fighting.  Well, when I got to the farm  nearest to this hut where we now sit, they told me that a tremendous  gale had been blowing in the mountains, that ten travellers had been  snowed up, and that they feared they must all have perished, since  travelling in such weather was impossible.\"    \"`Have you made no effort to rescue them?'  I asked of the farmer.    \"`No,' says he, `I couldn't get any o' my fellows to move, because  they've been terrified about a ghost that's been seen up there.'    \"`What was the ghost like?'  I asked; so he told me that it was a  fearful creature--a mulish-looking sort of man, who was in the habit of  terrifying the arrieros and peons who passed that way, but he said they  were going to get a priest to put a cross up there, and so lay the  ghost.    \"`Meanwhile,' I said, `the ten travellers are to be left to starve?'    \"`It's my belief they're starved already,' answered the farmer.\"    At this point Pedro paused to relight his cigarette, and Quashy breathed  a little more freely.  He was a firm believer in ghosts, and feared them  more than he would have feared an army of Redskins or jaguars.  Indeed  it is a question whether Quashy could ever have been brought to realise  the sensation of fear if it had not been for the existence, in his  imagination, of ghosts!  The mere mention of the word in present  circumstances had converted him into a sort of human sensitive-plant.  He gave a little start and glance over his shoulder at every gust of  unusual power that rattled the door, and had become visibly paler--  perhaps we should say less black.    Manuela was evidently troubled by no such fears, perhaps because she did  not understand the meaning of the word ghost, yet she gazed at the  speaker in apparently rapt attention.    \"You may believe,\" continued the guide, \"that I was disgusted at their  cowardice; so, to shame them, as well as to do what I could for the  travellers, I loaded a couple of my mules with meat, and said I would  set off alone.  This had the desired effect, for three men volunteered  to go with me.  When we reached the hut we found that six of the ten  poor fellows were dead.  The bodies of two who had died just before our  arrival were lying in the corner over there behind Quashy.  They were  more like skeletons covered with skin than corpses.  The four who still  lived were in the corner here beside me, huddled together for warmth,  and so worn out by hunger and despair that they did not seem to care at  first that we had come to save them.  We warmed and fed them, however,  brought them gradually round, and at last took them back to the farm.  They all recovered.  During the time they were snowed up the poor  fellows had eaten their mules and dogs.  I have no doubt that if the  ground were clear of snow you would find the bones of these animals  scattered about still.\"    This was not a very pleasant anecdote, Lawrence thought, on which to  retire to rest, so he changed the subject by asking Pedro if there were  many of the Incas still remaining.    Before he could reply Manuela rose, and, bidding them good-night in  Spanish, retired to her screened-off corner.    \"A good many of the Incas are still left,\" replied the guide to his  companion's question; \"and if you were to visit their capital city you  would be surprised to see the remains of temples and other evidences of  a very advanced civilisation in a people who existed long before the  conquest of Peru.\"    \"Massa Pedro,\" said Quashy, who would have been glad to have the  recollection of ghosts totally banished from his mind, \"I's oftin hear  ob de Incas, but I knows not'ing about dem.  Who is dey? whar dey come  fro?\"    \"It would take a long time, Quashy, to answer these two questions fully;  nevertheless, I think I could give you a roughish outline of a notion in  about five minutes, if you'll promise not to stare so hard, and keep  your mouth shut.\"    The negro shut his eyes, expanded his mouth to its utmost in a silent  laugh, and nodded his head acquiescently.    \"Well, then, you must know,\" said Pedro, \"that in days of old--about the  time that William the Conqueror invaded England--a"]]]
