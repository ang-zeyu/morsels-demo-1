Another method by which the motive becomes prominent in the art of the  fourth century is to be seen in the interpretation of mythological  conceptions. These are realised and embodied in statues; but the statues  offer a new, sometimes, it seems, almost an accidental and trifling  version of a solemn religious conception; it appears as if the artist  were playing with a mythological subject. Thus in the statue made by  Praxiteles of Apollo Sauroktonos, \"the lizard-slayer,\" the god stands  with an arrow in his hand, as if trying to catch with it a lizard who  runs up a tree; it suggests a boyish game rather than the epithet of a  god. Again, the worship of Artemis Brauronia at Athens was one of the  oldest and most sacred cults in the city, and women at marriage and at  other critical times of their life used to offer her their garments,  thereby bringing themselves into close contact with the goddess and  claiming her special protection, the garments being actually placed on  the old image. If, as is probable, the Artemis of Gabii is a copy of the  statue substituted by Praxiteles for this old image, we see there the  goddess, as a graceful girlish figure, fastening a cloak upon her  shoulder. This may be taken as symbolical of the earlier custom of  placing the garments on the statue; but we have evidence that the  worshippers were not content with such a symbolic contact, but had the  actual garments placed on the new statue as they had been on the old.  Here we have probably a case of unsuccessful substitution; the artistic  representation did not suffice to replace the actual rite. But the  representation itself is doubtless intended in a way which, however  graceful, does not represent any deep religious feeling; one feels that  the artist found the subject a convenient one as an artistic motive,  rather than that he had any deep religious idea to express.    We must not, however, go too far in denying religious ideals to the  fourth century altogether. Some of the gods, who came very near to the  life of man, but who were nevertheless worshipped with a real belief in  their power and benevolence, found at this time their fullest expression  in art. An example may be seen in the Demeter of Cnidus, the mother  sorrowing for her daughter, whose suffering brings her into close  sympathy with human weakness, and whose mysteries, perhaps more than any  other Hellenic service, brought men and women into personal communion  with the gods. We may take as another instance the head of Asclepius  from Melos in the British Museum. Here, as Brunn has pointed out in his  admirable analysis of its forms, we may recognise not so much the god as  the half-human, half-divine physician, a genial and friendly spirit who  persuades rather than commands. The expression is not only intellectual,  but has also an infinite gentleness, as of one not himself unacquainted  with mortal pain and sorrow; and such a conception, as we know from  Christian art, often appeals to those who find the majesty of Zeus too  distant, the idea of his godhead too abstract. In such almost human  ideals the individuality of the fourth century finds its full scope, as  in other half-human creations of the artist's imagination. Apollo as the  inspired musician or--if we accept the derivation of the Apollo  Belvedere from a fourth-century original--as the disdainful archer,  Hermes, the protector and playmate of his little brother Dionysus, and  many other such representations of the gods in their personal moods and  characteristic actions, seem in many ways less divine, less full of  religious feeling than such an Asclepius; if the great gods are brought  too near to human passions and weaknesses, they cannot but lose much of  their divinity.    One might easily multiply examples of similar motives in the statues of  the gods made in the fourth century; but we should find the same  underlying principles in all cases. The gods are indeed more clearly  realised as having personal character and individuality, and for this  reason they may sometimes inspire keener personal feelings of worship or  even of romantic devotion. But the older and higher conceptions of the  gods, as an essential part of the State religion, and as embodying the  ideals of the race or of the city, are no longer to be found, except in  a somewhat lifeless continuance of the fifth-century tradition. The  intensity of expression which we find in human heroes is, indeed,  expressed also in such types as that of Apollo the musician or of  Dionysus the god of inspired enthusiasm. But this tendency is not fully  developed until a later age. The subtle distinctions of character  between the different gods are, on the other hand, now most keenly  observed and most skilfully rendered. But in spite of this, one does not  feel that the artist has the same belief in the gods and in their power  as we can see in the Phidian age. If his artistic attainment is possibly  more skilful, the religious import of his work is certainly less.          CHAPTER VII    PERSONIFICATION, CONVENTION, AND SYMBOLISM      In the Hellenistic age we find the Greek types of the gods adapting  themselves to new conditions and new meanings. With the conquests of  Alexander, Greek language and civilisation spread over the Eastern  world; and with them went the artistic forms of the Greek pantheon,  though often to be modified by local beliefs or influences. Similarly,  when at a later time the Roman conquest of Greece spread Hellenic  influence to the West, there also the types of the Greek deities came to  be adopted or adapted to new mythological meanings. Greek art  practically became cosmopolitan; its influence was broadened; but at the  same time its essential nature, in its harmony with the imagination of  the Hellenic race, was lost or obscured. It becomes more intelligible to  us for this very reason, but at the same time less instructive in its  relation to religious conceptions.    In the art of the Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman age we find two main  tendencies, the one towards academic generalisation, and the other  towards excessive realism, often coupled with a theatrical or  sensational treatment. This latter is the more interesting to us, partly  because it is in itself more original, partly because it is more in  accordance with modern artistic practice. The two tendencies are by no  means rigidly distinguished; for example, we often find a theatrical  treatment combined with academic work; and throughout are to be seen  traces of eclecticism--that is to say, of the habit of imitating or  reproducing, often in an unintelligent manner, the devices and even the  style of earlier art. It does not follow that no great works of art were  made in the Hellenistic age; the fine traditions of the fifth and fourth  centuries were not easily lost. But the inspiration of the subject, so  far as it still exists, comes from new and different sources.    If we consider first the statues of the older gods of Greece, we often  find in them the individualistic tendencies of the fourth century  carried to a further pitch--sometimes to an extreme--in the sentimental  or passionate works of the Hellenistic age; there is often something  affected or dramatic about them, as if they were not merely realised as  expressing their individual character in their mood or action, but  acting their part as the representative of such a character; in fact,  they tend to embody impersonations rather than to express personalities.  One might almost repeat here much that has been said about the gods in  the fourth century, but that there is often, in this case, a touch of  exaggeration which is avoided by the finer artistic instinct and  appreciation of harmony that mark the work of earlier sculptors; and  joined with this we often find a love of display and a seeking after  effect which imply that the artist thinks more of his skill than of the  idea he is striving to express.    We can trace in the Hellenistic age not only the traditions of earlier  art, but the direct influence of the masters of the fourth century, the  Praxitelean cult of beauty for its own sake, the passion and dramatic  force of Scopas, and the preference for allegorical subjects and for  statues of colossal size which we may see, as well as many higher  qualities, in the art of Lysippus. We have already noticed how in the  Apollo Belvedere there is an impression of theatrical posing which was  probably either introduced by the copyist or at any rate much  exaggerated by him in imitating an earlier type; and how in the Venus  de' Medici we find a crude insistence on a gesture of mock modesty which  is a mere travesty of the hint at half-conscious shrinking from exposure  which we see in the Cnidian Aphrodite. Even in a statue which, like the  Aphrodite of Melos, shows an endeavour to return to the nobler ideals  and more dignified and simple forms of an earlier age, there is  something artificial and conventional about both figure and drapery; and  one feels that the sculptor, though both his aims and his attainments  are of the highest, is trying rather to reflect the best influences of  his predecessors than to embody a present religious conception.    The influence upon art of religious personifications is perhaps stronger  than any other during this period. There had, indeed, been such  personifications at an earlier time, such as the statue by Cephisodotus  of Peace nursing the infant Wealth. The most interesting example of such  personification may be seen in the figures of cities, or, to speak more  accurately, of the Fortunes of cities, such as the Antioch of  Eutychides. The influence of the city or state upon religious art was  conspicuous in the fifth century; but here we find the city itself or  its presiding genius"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20532"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#11)"],[1,"like this? A nice, light, cold dinner is ever so much better  for us than a lot of hot things.\"    The professor said nothing. He looked wan and unhappy.    We strolled out again into the garden, but somehow things seemed to  drag. Conversation was fitful, except on the part of Ukridge, who  continued to talk easily on all subjects, unconscious of the fact that  the party was depressed, and at least one of his guests rapidly  becoming irritable. I watched the professor furtively as Ukridge  talked on, and that ominous phrase of Mr. Chase's concerning  four-point-seven guns kept coming into my mind. If Ukridge were to  tread on any of his pet corns, as he might at any minute, there would  be an explosion. The snatching of the dinner from his very mouth, as  it were, and the substitution of a bread-and-cheese and sardines menu  had brought him to the frame of mind when men turn and rend their  nearest and dearest.    The sight of the table, when at length we filed into the dining room,  sent a chill through me. It was a meal for the very young or the very  hungry. The uncompromising coldness and solidity of the viands was  enough to appall a man conscious that his digestion needed humoring. A  huge cheese faced us in almost a swash-buckling way, and I noticed  that the professor shivered slightly as he saw it. Sardines, looking  more oily and uninviting than anything I had ever seen, appeared in  their native tin beyond the loaf of bread. There was a ham, in its  third quarter, and a chicken which had suffered heavily during a  previous visit to the table.    We got through the meal somehow, and did our best to delude ourselves  into the idea that it was all great fun, but it was a shallow  pretense. The professor was very silent by the time we had finished.  Ukridge had been terrible. When the professor began a story--his  stories would have been the better for a little more briskness and  condensation--Ukridge interrupted him before he had got halfway  through, without a word of apology, and began some anecdote of his  own. He disagreed with nearly every opinion he expressed. It is true  that he did it all in such a perfectly friendly way, and was obviously  so innocent of any intention of giving offense, that another man might  have overlooked the matter. But the professor, robbed of his good  dinner, was at the stage when he had to attack somebody. Every moment  I had been expecting the storm to burst.    It burst after dinner.    We were strolling in the garden when some demon urged Ukridge, apropos  of the professor's mention of Dublin, to start upon the Irish  question. My heart stood still.    Ukridge had boomed forth some very positive opinions of his own on the  subject of Ireland before I could get near enough to him to stop him.  When I did, I suppose I must have whispered louder than I had  intended, for the professor heard my words, and they acted as the  match to the powder.    \"He's touchy on the Irish question, is he?\" he thundered. \"Drop it, is  it? And why? Why, sir? I'm one of the best-tempered men that ever came  from Ireland, let me tell you, and I will not stay here to be insulted  by the insinuation that I cannot discuss Irish affairs as calmly as  anyone.\"    \"But, professor--\"    \"Take your hand off my arm, Mr. Garnet. I will not be treated like a  child. I am as competent to discuss the affairs of Ireland without  heat as any man, let me tell you.\"    \"Father--\"    \"And let me tell you, Mr. Ukridge, that I consider your opinions  poisonous. Poisonous, sir. And you know nothing whatever about the  subject, sir. I don't wish to see you or to speak to you again.  Understand that, sir. Our acquaintance began to-day, and it will  cease to-day. Good night to you. Come, Phyllis, me dear. Mrs. Ukridge,  good night.\"    Mr. Chase, when he spoke of four-point-seven guns, had known what he  was talking about.          DIES IRAE    IX      Why is it, I wonder, that stories of Retribution calling at the wrong  address strike us as funny instead of pathetic? I myself had been  amused by them many a time. In a book which I had just read, a shop  woman, being vexed with an omnibus conductor, had thrown a  superannuated orange at him. It had found its billet not on him, but  on a perfectly inoffensive spectator. The missile, we are told, \"'it a  young copper full in the hyeball.\" I had enjoyed this when I read it,  but now that fate had arranged a precisely similar situation, with  myself in the role of the young copper, the fun of the thing appealed  to me not at all.    It was Ukridge who was to blame for the professor's regrettable  explosion and departure, and he ought by all laws of justice to have  suffered for it. As it was, I was the only person materially affected.  It did not matter to Ukridge. He did not care twopence one way or the  other. If the professor were friendly, he was willing to talk to him  by the hour on any subject, pleasant or unpleasant. If, on the other  hand, he wished to have nothing more to do with us, it did not worry  him. He was content to let him go. Ukridge was a self-sufficing  person.    But to me it was a serious matter. More than serious. If I have done  my work as historian with any adequate degree of skill, the reader  should have gathered by this time the state of my feelings.    My love had grown with the days. Mr. J. Holt Schooling, or somebody  else with a taste for juggling with figures, might write a very  readable page or so of statistics in connection with the growth of  love in the heart of a man. In some cases it is, I believe, slow. In  my own I can only say that Jack's beanstalk was a backward plant in  comparison. It is true that we had not seen a great deal of one  another, and that, when we had met, our interviews had been brief and  our conversation conventional; but it is the intervals between the  meetings that do the real damage. Absence, as the poet neatly remarks,  makes the heart grow fonder. And now, thanks to Ukridge's amazing  idiocy, a barrier had been thrust between us. As if the business of  fishing for a girl's heart were not sufficiently difficult and  delicate without the addition of needless obstacles! It was terrible  to have to reestablish myself in the good graces of the professor  before I could so much as begin to dream of Phyllis.    Ukridge gave me no balm.    \"Well, after all,\" he said, when I pointed out to him quietly but  plainly my opinion of his tactlessness, \"what does it matter? There  are other people in the world besides the old buffer. And we haven't  time to waste making friends, as a matter of fact. The farm ought to  keep us busy. I've noticed, Garny, old boy, that you haven't seemed  such a whale for work lately as you might be. You must buckle to, old  horse. We are at a critical stage. On our work now depends the success  of the speculation. Look at those cocks. They're always fighting.  Fling a stone at them. What's the matter with you? Can't get the novel  off your chest, what? You take my tip, and give your mind a rest.  Nothing like manual labor for clearing the brain. All the doctors say  so. Those coops ought to be painted to-day or to-morrow. Mind you, I  think old Derrick would be all right if one persevered--\"    \"And didn't call him a fat old buffer, and contradict everything he  said and spoil all his stories by breaking in with chestnuts of your  own in the middle,\" I interrupted with bitterness.    \"Oh, rot, old boy! He didn't mind being called a fat old buffer. You  keep harping on that. A man likes one to be chatty with him. What was  the matter with old Derrick was a touch of liver. You should have  stopped him taking that cheese. I say, old man, just fling another  stone at those cocks, will you? They'll eat one another.\"    I had hoped, fearing the while that there was not much chance of such  a thing happening, that the professor might get over his feeling of  injury during the night, and be as friendly as ever next day. But he  was evidently a man who had no objection whatever to letting the sun  go down upon his wrath, for, when I met him on the beach the  following morning, he cut me in the most uncompromising fashion.    Phyllis was with him at the time, and also another girl who was, I  supposed from the strong likeness between them, her sister. She had  the same soft mass of brown hair. But to me she appeared almost  commonplace in comparison.    It is never pleasant to be cut dead. It produces the same sort of  feeling as is experienced when one treads on nothing where one  imagined a stair to be. In the present instance the pang was mitigated  to a certain extent--not largely--by the fact that Phyllis looked at  me. She did not move her head, and I could not have declared  positively that she moved her eyes; but nevertheless she certainly  looked at me. It was something. She seemed to say that duty compelled  her to follow her father's lead, and that the act must not be taken as  evidence of any personal animus.    That, at least, was how I read off the message.    Two days later I met Mr. Chase in the village.    \"Halloo! so you're back,\" I said.    \"You've discovered my secret,\" said he. \"Will you have a cigar or a  cocoanut?\"    There was a pause.    \"Trouble, I hear, while I was away,\" he said.    I nodded.    \"The man I live with, Ukridge, did it. Touched on the Irish question.\"    \"Home rule?\"    \"He mentioned it among other things.\"    \"And the professor went off?\"    \"Like a bomb.\"    \"He would. It's a pity.\"    I agreed.    I am glad to say that I suppressed the desire to ask him to use his  influence, if any, with Professor Derrick to effect a reconciliation.  I felt that I must play the game.    \"I ought not to be speaking to you, you know,\" said Mr. Chase. \"You're  under arrest.\"    \"He's still--\" I stopped for a word.    \"Very much so. I'll do what I can.\"    \"It's very good of you.\"    \"But the time is not yet ripe. He may be said at present to be  simmering"]]]
