[Illustration: FIG. 22.]    Here are two fragments of a kind of running ornament. Fig. 22 is a part  of the jamb molding of a church in Vicenza. If you observe carefully,  you will find that it has a decidedly classical appearance. The truth is  that it was carved by a Gothic artist late in the fourteenth century,  just after the Renaissance influence began to make itself felt. It is an  adaptation by him of what he remembered having seen in his travels of  the new style, grafted upon the traditional treatment ready to his hand.  It suits our purpose all the better on that account, for the reason that  we are going to re-adapt his design into an exercise, and shall attempt  to make it suitable to our limited ability in handling the tools, to the  change in material from stone to wood, and lastly, to our different  aims and motives in the treatment of architectural ornament. Please do  all this for yourself in another design, and look upon this suggestion  merely in the light of helping a lame dog over a stile.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.]    In this exercise (Fig. 23) you will repeat all you have already done  with the others, until you come to the shaping of the leaves, in which  an undulating or up and down motion has been attempted. This involves a  kind of double drawing in the curves, one for the flat and one for the  projections; so that they may appear to glide evenly from one point to  the other, sweeping up and down, right and left, without losing their  true contours. Carvers call this process \"throwing about,\" i.e., making  the leaves, etc., appear to rise from the background and again fall  toward it in all directions. The phrase is a very meager one, and but  poorly expresses the necessity for intimate sympathy between each  surface so \"thrown about.\" It is precisely in the observance of this  last quality that effects of richness are produced. You can hardly have  too much monotony of surface, but may easily err by having too much  variety. Therefore, whatever system of light and shade you may adopt, be  careful to repeat its motive in some sort of rhythmic order all over  your work; by no other means can you make it rich and effective at a  distance.    It is well every now and then to put your work up on a shelf or ledge at  a distance and view it as a whole; you will thus see which parts tell  and which do not, and so gain experience on this point. Work should also  be turned about frequently, sidewise and upside down, in order to find  how the light affects it in different directions. Of course, you must  not think that because your work may happen to look well when seen from  a little way off that it does not matter about the details, whether they  be well or poorly carved. On the contrary, unless you satisfy the eye at  both points of view, your work is a partial failure. The one thing is as  important as the other, only, as the first glance at carved work is  generally taken at some little distance, it is the more immediately  necessary to think of that, before we begin to work for a closer  inspection. First impressions are generally lasting with regard to  carved work, and, as I have said before, beauty of detail seldom quite  atones for failure in the arrangement of masses.    The rounded forms in this design may give you a little trouble, but  practise, and that alone, will enable you to overcome this. Absolute  smoothness is not desirable. Glass-papered surfaces are extremely ugly,  because they obtrude themselves on account of their extreme smoothness,  having lost all signs of handiwork in the tool marks. We shall have  something to say presently about these tool marks in finishing, as it is  a very important subject which may make all the difference between  success or failure in finishing a piece of work.          CHAPTER XII    ORIGINALITY           Dangers of Imposing Words--Novelty more Common than Originality--An       Unwholesome Kind of \"Originality.\"      I told you that I should have something to say about originality. Almost  every beginner has some vague impression that his first duty should be  to aim at originality. He hears eulogiums passed upon the individuality  of some one or other, and tries hard to invent new forms of expression  or peculiarities of style, only resulting, in most cases, in new forms  of ugliness, which it seems is the only possibility under such conscious  efforts after novelty. The fact is that it takes many generations of  ardent minds to accomplish what at first each thinks himself capable of  doing alone. True originality has somewhat the quality of good wine,  which becomes more delightful as time mellows its flavor and imparts to  it the aroma which comes of long repose; like the new wine, too,  originality should shyly hide itself in dark places until maturity  warrants its appearance in the light of day. That kind of originality  which is strikingly new does not always stand the test of time, and  should be regarded with cautious skepticism until it has proved itself  to be more than the passing fashion or novelty of a season. There is a  kind of sham art very conspicuous at the present time, which was at  quite a recent date popularly believed to be very original. It seems to  have arisen out of some such impatient craving for novelty, and it has  been encouraged by an easy-going kind of suburban _refinement_, which  neither knows nor cares very much what really goes to the making of a  work of art. This new art has filled our shops and exhibitions with an  invertebrate kind of ornament, which certainly has the doubtful merit of  \"never having been seen before.\" It has evidently taken its inspiration  from the trailing and supine forms of floating seaweed, and revels in  the expression of such boneless structure. By way of variety it presents  us with a kind of symbolic tree, remarkable for more than archaic  flatness and rigidity. Now, this kind of \"originality\" is not only  absolutely valueless, but exceedingly harmful; its only merit is that,  like its ideal seaweed, it has no backbone of its own, and we may hope  that it will soon betake itself to its natural home, the slimy bottom of  the ocean of oblivion.    Meantime, the only thing we are absolutely sure of in connection with  that much-abused word \"originality\" is this, that no gift, original or  otherwise, can be developed without steady and continuous practise with  the tools of your craft.          CHAPTER XIII    PIERCED PATTERNS           Exercise in Background Pattern--Care as to Stability--Drilling and       Sawing out the Spaces--Some Uses for Pierced Patterns.      The present exercises may be described as a kind of carved open  fretwork--that is to say, the ground is entirely cut away, leaving the  pattern standing free. This will form an excellent piece of discipline  with regard to the design of background forms, because in such work as  this, those forms assert themselves in a very marked manner; if they are  in any way found to be conspicuously unequal in size or are awkwardly  designed as to shape, the whole effect of the work is spoiled.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.]    For your first effort make a design based upon No. 24, and please to  observe these rules in its construction. The main or leading lines of  the pattern are to run as much as possible without crossing each other.  The holes are to be fairly equal in size, or rather in area, as they  need not be at all like each other in shape. The amount of wood left  standing to be of a width averaging never less than half the length of  the average-sized hole. This is necessary for securing sufficient  strength of material in the cross-grained pieces, which would be liable  to split if made too long and narrow. The pattern should be formal in  character, not necessarily symmetrical, but it should be well balanced.  You may have one part of your design composed of large holes and another  of small ones, provided the change is part of a definite design, as in  Fig. 25. You may even leave the wood in some parts forming a solid  background, or you may treat it as a separate piece of simple carving  on the solid, as in Fig. 26, being careful to execute it in a  consistently simple manner, as in this kind of work much change of  manner in execution is inadvisable, although, at the same time, it is  open to any amount of variety in design of outline and combination of  contrasts.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.]    [Illustration: FIG. 26.]    Take a piece of pine about 3 or 4 ft. long and 7 or 9 ins. wide by 3/4  in. thick. Trace on your pattern and drill circular holes in the middle  of each space to be cut through. Then take a keyhole saw, and remove the  wood by sawing round the space close to the blue line, taking care not  to cut through it in any place. The saw must be held very truly upright  in order to cut the sides of the spaces at right angles to the face of  the wood. Now carve the pattern on the surface in whatever manner you  have designed--in grooves suggesting the articulation of the leaves, in  short grooves which may pass for additional leaves, or in a dozen ways  which practise may help you to invent.    The wood should be held tightly down to the bench in all its parts, or,  at least, in those being operated upon, as it may, if unsupported, crack  across some of the narrow parts. The sides of all the holes must be  carved out clean to remove the rough saw marks. This can be done partly  by gouges, or still better, the wood may be held up on its edge and the  holes cut round with a sharp penknife where the grain allows it. Now  turn the work over on its face and carve bevels round each of the holes.  This reduces the apparent thickness of wood, and adds to the effect of  delicacy in the pattern.

Fasten the tapwaist  inside the mash-tub to the inner end of the faucet and spigot, taking  care to place the mash-tub in an elevated position, resting upon two  benches or stools. Early in the dawn of morning, light the fire under  your copper, filled with water over-night, and, as soon as it boils,  with it fill the mash-tub rather more than three-parts full; and as soon  as the first heat of the water has subsided, and you find that you are  able to bear your fingers drawn slowly through it without experiencing  pain, you must then throw in the malt, stirring it about for ten minutes  or so; then lay some sticks across the mash-tub, and cover it with sacks  or blankets, and allow it to steep for three hours. At the end of the  three hours, let off the wort from the mash-tub into the underback-tub,  which has been previously placed under the spigot and faucet ready to  receive it; pouring the first that runs out back into the mash, until  the wort runs free from grains, etc.; now put the hops into the  underback-tub and let the wort run out upon them. Your copper having  been refilled, and boiled again while the mash is in progress, you must  now pour sufficient boiling water into the grains left in the mash-tub  to make up your quantity of fifty-four gallons; and when this second  mashing shall have also stood some two hours, let it be drawn off, and  afterwards mixed with the first batch of wort, and boil the whole at two  separate boilings, with the hops equally divided; each lot to be allowed  to boil for an hour and a-half after it has commenced boiling. The beer  is now to be strained through the loose wicker basket into your cooling  tubs and pans; the more you have of these the better the beer, from its  cooling quickly. And when the beer has cooled to the degree of water  which has stood in the house in summer-time for some hours, let it all  be poured into your two or three largest tubs, keeping back a couple or  three quarts in a pan, with which to mix a pint of good yeast and a  table-spoonful of common salt; stir this mixture well together, keep it  in rather a warm part of the house, and in the course of half an hour or  so, it will work up to the top of the basin or pan. This worked beer  must now be equally divided between the two or three tubs containing the  bulk of the beer, and is to be well mixed in by ladling it about with a  wooden hand-bowl for a couple of minutes. This done, cover over the beer  with sacks or blankets stretched upon sticks across the tubs, and leave  them in this state for forty-eight hours. The next thing to be seen to  is to get your barrels placed in proper order and position for being  filled; and to this end attend strictly to the following directions,  viz.:--First, skim off the scum, which is yeast, from the top or surface  of the tubs, and next, draw off the beer through the spigot, and with  the wooden funnel placed in the bung-hole, proceed to fill up the  barrels not quite full; and, remember, that if a few hops are put into  each before filling in the beer, it will keep all the better. Reserve  some of the beer with which to fill up the barrels as they throw up the  yeast while the beer is working; and when the yeast begins to fall, lay  the bungs upon the bung-holes, and at the end of ten days or a  fortnight, hammer the bungs in tight, and keep the vent-pegs tight also.  In about two months' time after the beer has been brewed, it will be in  a fit condition for drinking.      No. 131. HOW TO BAKE YOUR OWN BREAD.    Put a bushel of flour into a trough, or a large pan; with your fist make  a deep hole in the centre thereof; put a pint of good fresh yeast into  this hollow; add thereto two quarts of warm water, and work in with  these as much of the flour as will serve to make a soft smooth kind of  batter. Strew this over with just enough flour to hide it; then cover up  the trough with its lid, or with a blanket to keep all warm, and when  the leaven has risen sufficiently to cause the flour to crack all over  its surface, throw in a handful of salt, work all together; add just  enough lukewarm soft water to enable you to work the whole into a firm,  compact dough, and after having kneaded this with your fists until it  becomes stiff and comparatively tough, shake a little flour over it, and  again cover it in with a blanket to keep it warm, in order to assist its  fermentation. If properly managed, the fermentation will be accomplished  in rather less than half an hour. Meanwhile that the bread is being thus  far prepared, you will have heated your oven to a satisfactory degree of  heat, with a sufficient quantity of dry, small wood faggots; and when  all the wood is burnt, sweep out the oven clean and free from all ashes.  Divide your dough into four-pound loaves, knead them into round shapes,  making a hole at the top with your thumb, and immediately put them out  of hand into the oven to bake, closing the oven-door upon them. In about  two hours' time they will be thoroughly baked, and are then to be taken  out of the oven, and allowed to become quite cold before they are put  away in the cupboard.      No. 132. YORKSHIRE PIE-CLATES FOR TEA.    Ingredients, one pound of flour, two ounces of grocer's currants, three  gills of milk, and a pinch of baking-powder. Mix the above ingredients  together in a pan into a firm, smooth, compact paste. Divide this into  eight equal parts, roll each into a ball with the hand previously dipped  in flour, then roll them out with a rolling-pin, with a little flour  shaken on the table to prevent the paste from sticking, to the size of a  tea-saucer, and bake the pie-clates upon a griddle-iron fixed over a  clear fire to the upper bar of the grate. In about two or three minutes'  time they will be done on the underside; they must then be turned over  that they may be also baked on the other side, then taken off the  griddle-iron, placed on a plate, and a little butter spread upon each as  they are done out of hand.      No. 133. HARD BISCUITS.    Ingredients, one pound of flour, half a pint of hot milk, a tea-spoonful  of salt, a pinch of baking-powder; bake them a quarter of an hour. Mix  the above ingredients into a firm paste, well kneaded until it becomes  quite tough; then let the paste rest covered over with a cloth for half  an hour, after which it is to be divided into eight equal parts, rolled  out to the size of tea-saucers, placed upon baking-tins, pricked all  over with a fork, and baked in a brisk oven for about fifteen minutes.      No. 134. GINGERBREAD NUTS.    Ingredients, one pound of flour, half a pint of treacle, two ounces of  butter, half an ounce of ground ginger, a pinch of allspice, a  tea-spoonful of carbonate of soda, and a pinch of salt. Mix all the  above ingredients into a firm, well-kneaded stiff paste, divide this  into about twenty-four parts, roll these into shape like walnuts, place  them upon greased baking-tins at distances of two inches apart from each  other, and bake the gingerbread nuts in a rather brisk oven for about  fifteen minutes.      No. 135. HOW TO STEAM POTATOES.    Peel the potatoes thinly, wash them clean, put them in the steamer, over  _boiling_ water, which must be kept briskly boiling until the potatoes  are thoroughly done, the length of time depending very much on their  size. I am aware that it is not in the power of all to possess a  potato-steamer, although one may be purchased at Adams & Son's, in the  Haymarket, for a few shillings; and therefore I will give you  instructions how to boil potatoes.      No. 136. HOW TO BOIL POTATOES.    Wash the potatoes clean, and put them on to boil in a saucepan, with  cold water just enough to cover them; place the saucepan on the hob,  close to the fire, and allow them to remain in that position for a  quarter of an hour, by which time the water will have gradually reached  to the boiling point; the saucepan should now be allowed to boil until  the potatoes are done through, and then pour off the water; put the lid  on again with a cloth on the top, place the saucepan close to the fire  for about five minutes, and when you turn them out on their dish you  will find that you have a well-boiled, mealy potato before you.      No. 137. BAKED OR ROASTED POTATOES.    You do not require that I should tell you that when you have no oven you  can easily roast your potatoes by placing them on the hobs, bars, and  under the fire-grate; and if you are attentive to their being well  roasted, by turning them about now and then, so that they may be done  all over alike, you need not be deprived of a baked potato for the want  of an oven. When the potatoes are roasted, slightly squeeze each  separately in a cloth, to make them mealy, then split them open; season  them with a bit of butter, or dripping, a little bit of chopped shalot,  pepper, and salt, and this will afford you a nice relish for supper.      No. 138. HOW TO FRY POTATOES.    Peel, split, and cut the potatoes into slices of _equal_ thickness, say  the thickness of two penny pieces; and as they are cut out of hand, let  them be dropped into a pan of cold water. When about to fry the  potatoes, first drain them on a clean cloth, and dab them all over, in  order to absorb all moisture; while this has been going on, you will  have made some kind of fat (entirely free from water or gravy, such as  lard, for instance) very hot in a frying-pan, and into this drop your  prepared potatoes, only a good handful at a time; as, if you attempt to  fry too many at once, instead of being crisp, as they should be, the  potatoes will fry flabby, and consequently will be unappetising. As soon  as the first lot is fried in a satisfactory manner, drain them from the  fat with a skimmer, or spoon, and then fry the remainder; and when all  are fried, shake a little salt over them.      No."]]]
