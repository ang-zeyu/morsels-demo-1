Andrew Johnson.    The following is General Grant's Report transmitted to Congress with the  foregoing Message:    Headquarters Armies of the United States, Washington, D. C., Dec. 18,  1865.    Sir:--In reply to your note of the 16th inst., requesting a report from  me giving such information as I may be possessed, coming within the  scope of the inquiries made by the Senate of the United States, in their  resolution of the 12th inst., I have the honor to submit the following:    With your approval, and also that of the Honorable Secretary of War, I  left Washington City on the 27th of last month for the purpose of making  a tour of inspection through some of the Southern States, or States  lately in rebellion, and to see what changes were necessary to be made  in the disposition of the Military forces of the country; how these  forces could be reduced and expenses curtailed, etc., and to learn as  far as possible, the feelings and intentions of the citizens of those  States towards the General Government.    The State of Virginia being so accessible to Washington City, and  information from this quarter therefore being readily obtained, I  hastened through the State without conversing or meeting with any of its  citizens. In Raleigh, North Carolina, I spent one day; in Charleston,  South Carolina, I spent two days; Savannah and Augusta, Georgia, each  one day. Both in traveling and while stopping, I saw much and conversed  freely with the citizens of those States, as well as with officers  of the Army who have been stationed among them. The following are the  conclusions come to by me:    I am satisfied that the mass of the thinking men of the South accept  the present situation of affairs in good faith. The questions which  have heretofore divided the sentiments of the people of the two  sections--Slavery and State Rights, or the right of a State to secede  from the Union--they regard as having been settled forever by the  highest tribunal--arms--that man can resort to. I was pleased to  learn from the leading men whom I met, that they not only accepted the  decision arrived at, as final, but that now, when the smoke of battle  has cleared away, and time has been given for reflection, this decision  has been a fortunate one for the whole country, they receiving like  benefits from it with those who opposed them in the field and in  council.    Four years of war, during which law was executed only at the point of  the bayonet throughout the States in rebellion, have left the people  possibly in a condition not to yield that ready obedience to civil  authority the American people have been in the habit of generally  yielding. This would render the presence of small garrisons throughout  those States necessary until such time as labor returns to its proper  channels and civil authority is fully established. I did not meet  anyone, either those holding places under the Government or citizens of  the Southern States, who think it practicable to withdraw the Military  from the South at present. The white and black mutually require  the protection of the General Government. There is such universal  acquiescence in the authority of the General Government throughout  the portions of the country visited by me, that the mere presence of  a military force, without regard to numbers, is sufficient to maintain  order. The good of the country and economy require that the force kept  in the interior where there are many freedmen (elsewhere in the Southern  States than at forts upon the sea coast, no more is necessary,) should  all be white troops. The reasons for this are obvious without mentioning  any of them. The presence of black troops, lately slaves, demoralizes  labor both by their advice and by furnishing in their camps a resort  for freedmen for long distances around. White troops generally excite no  opposition, and therefore a small number of them can maintain order in  a given district. Colored troops must be kept in bodies sufficient to  defend themselves. It is not thinking men who would use violence towards  any class of troops sent among them by the General Government, but the  ignorant in some cases might, and the late slave seems to be imbued with  the idea that the property of his late master should of right belong to  him, or at least should have no protection from the colored soldiers.  There is danger of collision being brought on by such causes.    My observations lead me to the conclusion that the citizens of the  Southern States are anxious to return to self government within the  Union as soon as possible; that while reconstructing they want and  require protection from the Government; that they are in earnest  in wishing to do what they think is required by the Government, not  humiliating to them as citizens, and that if such is pointed out they  would pursue it in good faith. It is to be regretted that there cannot  be a greater commingling at this time between the citizens of the two  sections, and particularly with THOSE ENTRUSTED WITH THE LAWMAKING  POWER.    I did not give, the operation of the Freedmen's Bureau that attention I  would have done if more time had been at my disposal. Conversations on  the subject, however, with officers connected with the Bureau, led me  to think that in some of the States its affairs have not been conducted  with good judgment and economy, and that the belief, widely spread  among the freedmen of the Southern States, that the land of their former  masters will, at least in part, be divided among them, has come from  the agents of this Bureau. This belief is seriously interfering with the  willingness of the freedmen to make contracts for the coming year. In  some form the Freedmen's Bureau is an absolute necessity until civil law  is established and enforced, securing to the freedmen their rights and  full protection. At present, however, it is independent of the Military  establishment of the country, and seems to be operated by the different  agents of the Bureau according to their individual notions, every where.  Gen. Howard, the able head of the Bureau, made friends by the just  and fair instructions and advice he gave; but the complaint in South  Carolina was that, when he left, things went on as before. Many, perhaps  the majority of the agents of the Bureau, advised the freedmen that by  their industry they must expect to live. To this end they endeavor to  secure employment for them: to see that both contracting parties  comply with their agreements. In some instances; I am sorry to say,  the freedman's mind does not seem to be disabused of the idea that a  freedman has a right to live without care or provision for the future.  The effect of the belief in the division of lands is idleness and  accumulation in camps, towns, and cities. In such cases, I think it will  be found that vice and disease will tend to the extermination, or great  reduction of the colored race. It cannot be expected that the opinions  held by men at the South can be changed in a day, and therefore the  freedmen require for a few years not only laws to protect them, but the  fostering care of those who will give them good counsel and in whom they  can rely.    U. S. Grant, Lieutenant General.    This report was at once vigorously denounced in and out of Congress,  by the extremists. Mr. Sumner characterized it in the Senate, as a  \"whitewashing report.\" The standing of General Grant in the country at  large, however, was such that few had the indiscretion to attack him  openly.    The controlling element of the party which had elected Lincoln and  Johnson, had acquiesced for a time in the plan of reconstruction  foreshadowed by Mr. Lincoln and adopted by Mr. Johnson, but during the  summer of 1865, frictions developed between Mr. Johnson and those who  on Mr. Lincoln's death had assumed the leadership in the work of  reconstruction and other matters of administration, came to take the  opposite ground, from the first occupied by Sumner and other extremists  in Congress--that the States lately in rebellion had destroyed  themselves by their own act of war, and had thereby forfeited all the  rights of Statehood and were but conquered provinces, subject solely to  the will of the conqueror.    From that point their ways parted and widened from month to month,  till bitter hostility, political and personal, came to mark even their  official intercourse.    Mr. Johnson was practically unknown to the great mass of the people  of the North till he succeeded to the Presidency. He was in no sense  regarded as or assumed to be the leader of the dominant party; while  those who on Mr. Lincoln's death became leaders of the dominant party  in opposition to Mr. Johnson's administration and policies, were  widely known and of long public experience, and had correspondingly the  confidence of their party.    So, in the strife that ensued, as it became embittered with the lapse  of time, Mr. Johnson was at great disadvantage, and made little or  no headway, but rather lost ground as the controversy progressed. His  moderate, conservative views, radically expressed, in regard to what  should be the methods of reconstruction and the restoration of the  Union, found little favor with the mass of the veterans of the Union  armies who had but lately returned from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2443"],[0,"The Story of the Mormons, from the Date of Their Origin to the Year 1901 (#11)"],[1," conclusion that \"there was not  on earth the religion she sought.\" Joe, in his description of his state  of mind just before the first visit of the angel who told him about  the plates, describes himself as distracted by the \"war and tumult of  opinions.\" He doubtless heard this subject talked of by his mother  in the home circle, but none of his acquaintances at the time had any  reason to think that he was laboring under such mental distress.    The second person in the neighborhood whom Joe approached about his  discovery was Willard Chase, in whose well the \"peek-stone\" was found.  Mr. Chase in his statement (given at length by Howe) says that Joe  applied to him, soon after the above quoted conversation with Ingersol,  to make a chest in which to lock up his Gold Book, offering Chase an  interest in it as compensation. He told Chase that the discovery of  the book was due to the \"peek-stone,\" making no allusion whatever to an  angel's visit. He and Chase could not come to terms, and Joe accordingly  made a box in which what he asserted were the plates were placed.    Reports of Joe's discovery soon gained currency in the neighborhood  through the family's account of it, and neighbors who had accompanied  them on the money-seeking expeditions came to hear about the new Bible,  and to request permission to see it. Joe warded off these requests  by reiterating that no man but him could look upon it and live.  \"Conflicting stories were afterward told,\" says Tucker, \"in regard to  the manner of keeping the book in concealment and safety, which are  not worth repeating, further than to mention that the first place of  secretion was said to be under a heavy hearthstone in the Smith family  mansion.\"    Joe's mother and Parley P. Pratt tell of determined efforts of mobs and  individuals to secure possession of the plates; but their statements  cannot be taken seriously, and are contradicted by Tucker from personal  knowledge. Tucker relates that two local wags, William T. Hussey and  Azel Vandruver, intimate acquaintances of Smith, on asking for a sight  of the book and hearing Joe's usual excuse, declared their readiness to  risk their lives if that were the price of the privilege. Smith was not  to be persuaded, but, the story continues, \"they were permitted to go to  the chest with its owner, and see WHERE the thing was, and observe its  shape and size, concealed under a piece of thick canvas. Smith, with his  accustomed solemnity of demeanor, positively persisting in his refusal  to uncover it, Hussey became impetuous, and (suiting his action to  his word) ejaculated, 'Egad, I'll see the critter, live or die,' and  stripping off the canvas, a large tile brick was exhibited. But Smith's  fertile imagination was equal to the emergency. He claimed that his  friends had been sold by a trick of his.\"*         * \"Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism,\" p. 31.      Mother Smith, in her book, gives an account of proceedings in court  brought by the wife of Martin Harris to protect her husband's property  from Smith, on the plea that Smith was deceiving him in alleging the  existence of golden plates; and she relates how one witness testified  that Joe told him that \"the box which he had contained nothing but sand,\"  that a second witness swore that Joe told him, \"it was nothing but a  box of lead,\" and that a third witness declared that Joe had told him  \"there was nothing at all in the box.\" When Joe had once started the  story of his discovery, he elaborated it in his usual way. \"I distinctly  remember,\" says Daniel Hendrix, \"his sitting on some boxes in the store  and telling a knot of men, who did not believe a word they heard, all  about his vision and his find. But Joe went into such minute and careful  details about the size, weight, and beauty of the carvings on the golden  tablets, and strange characters and the ancient adornments, that I  confess he made some of the smartest men in Palmyra rub their eyes in  wonder.\"        CHAPTER V. -- THE DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF THE REVELATION OF THE BIBLE    The precise date when Joe's attention was first called to the  possibility of changing the story about his alleged golden plates so  that they would serve as the basis for a new Bible such as was finally  produced, and as a means of making him a prophet, cannot be ascertained.  That some directing mind gave the final shape to the scheme is shown by  the difference between the first accounts of his discovery by means  of the stone, and the one provided in his autobiography. We have also  evidence that the story of a direct revelation by an angel came some  time later than the version which Joe gave first to his acquaintances in  Pennsylvania.    James T. Cobb of Salt Lake City, who has given much time to  investigating matters connected with early Mormon history, received a  letter under date of April 23, 1879, from Hiel and Joseph Lewis, sons  of the Rev. Nathaniel Lewis, of Harmony, Pennsylvania, and relatives of  Joseph's father-in-law, in which they gave the story of the finding of  the plates as told in their hearing by Joe to their father, when he was  translating them. This statement, in effect, was that he dreamed of  an iron box containing gold plates curiously engraved, which he must  translate into a book; that twice when he attempted to secure the plates  he was knocked down, and when he asked why he could not have them, \"he  saw a man standing over the spot who, to him, appeared like a Spaniard,  having a long beard down over his breast, with his throat cut from ear  to ear and the blood streaming down, who told him that he could not get  it alone.\" (He then narrated how he got the box in company with Emma.)  In all this narrative there was not one word about visions of God, or of  angels, or heavenly revelations; all his information was by that dream  and that bleeding ghost. The heavenly visions and messages of angels,  etc., contained in the Mormon books were afterthoughts, revised to  order.    In direct confirmation of this we have the following account of the  disclosure of the buried articles as given by Joe's father to Fayette  Lapham when the Bible was first published:--    \"Soon after joining the church he [Joseph] had a very singular dream....  A very large, tall man appeared to him dressed in an ancient suit of  clothes, and the clothes were bloody. This man told him of a buried  treasure, and gave him directions by means of which he could find the  place. In the course of a year Smith did find it, and, visiting it by  night, \"I by some supernatural power\" was enabled to overturn a huge  boulder under which was a square block of masonry, in the centre of  which were the articles as described. Taking up the first article, he  saw others below; laying down the first, he endeavored to secure the  others; but, before he could get hold of them, the one he had taken up  slid back to the place he had taken it from, and, to his great surprise  and terror, the rock immediately fell back to its former place, nearly  crushing him [Joseph] in its descent. While trying in vain to raise the  rock again with levers, Joseph felt something strike him on the breast,  a third blow knocking him down; and as he lay on the ground he saw  the tall man, who told him that the delivery of the articles would be  deferred a year because Joseph had not strictly followed the directions  given to him. The heedless Joseph allowed himself to forget the date  fixed for his next visit, and when he went to the place again, the tall  man appeared and told him that, because of his lack of punctuality, he  would have to wait still another year before the hidden articles would  be confided to him. \"Come in one year from this time, and bring your  oldest brother with you,\" said the guardian of the treasures, \"then you  may have them.\" Before the date named arrived, the elder brother  had died, and Joseph decided that his wife was the proper person to  accompany him. Mr. Lapham's report proceeds as follows:--    \"At the expiration of the year he [Joseph] procured a horse and light  wagon, with a chest and pillowcase, and proceeded punctually with his  wife to find the hidden treasure. When they had gone as far as they  could with the wagon, Joseph took the pillow-case and started for the  rock. Upon passing a fence a host of devils began to screech and  to scream, and make all sorts of hideous yells, for the purpose of  terrifying him and preventing the attainment of his object; but Joseph  was courageous and pursued his way in spite of them. Arriving at the  stone, he again lifted it with the aid of superhuman power, as at  first, and secured the first or uppermost article, this time putting it  carefully into the pillow-case before laying it down. He now attempted  to secure the remainder; but just then the same old man appeared, and  said to him that the time had not yet arrived for their exhibition to  the world, but that when the proper time came he should have them and  exhibit them, with the one he had now secured; until that time arrived,  no one must be allowed to touch the one he had in his possession; for  if they did, they would be knocked down by some superhuman power. Joseph  ascertained that the remaining articles were a gold hilt and chain, and  a gold ball with two pointers. The hilt and chain had once been part  of a sword of unusual size; but the blade had rusted away and become  useless. Joseph then turned the rock back, took the article in the  pillow-case, and returned to the wagon. The devils, with more hideous  yells than before, followed him to the fence; as he was getting over the  fence, one of the devils struck him a blow on the side, where a black  and blue spot remained three or four days; but Joseph persevered and  brought the article safely home. \"I weighed it,\" said Mr. Smith, Sr.,  \"and it weighed 30 pounds.\" In answer to our question as to what it was  that Joseph had thus obtained, he said it"]]]
