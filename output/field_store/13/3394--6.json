So I drank, and slept, and drank again, and later found strength and  appetite sufficient to crawl back to where the dead horses lay, and to  search among the scattered contents of my pack for some biltong, and  the wherewithal to dress my wounds.    And thus for days I lived, and nursed myself gradually back to a  measure of my former strength; dragging myself painfully from the water  to the shadow of the rocks to sleep, feeling little anxiety as to where  I was or what was to happen to me. I had water in plenty and food  sufficient for the present, and after the awful experiences of the  desert my one desire was to rest and sleep.    But with returning health came curiosity; and although I was still bent  and could not walk upright, I managed to move about and to find out  something of this strange prison into which I had been hurled in my  frantic flight before the sandstorm.    Apparently I was in the hollow cup of an extinct crater, for on all  sides towered perpendicular cliffs of dark granite-like rock, so smooth  and unbroken for the most part that a baboon would scarce have found  foothold upon them indeed, in many places they actually overhung.  Almost circular, and about a quarter of a mile in diameter, the floor  of this place was to a great extent covered in verdure, broken here and  there with rocks, and except where I had fallen there was but little  bare sand.    How I had escaped being smashed to pieces was inexplicable, for the  sheer wall of rock that penned me in was, I judged, at least five  hundred feet in height, and the horses' bones now picked clean by the  aasvogels had been smashed by the terrible fall. A short examination of  my little domain showed me that although escape from it was apparently  hopeless especially in my maimed condition there was no need for me to  starve, and indeed my prison was a very pleasant one. There were wild  fruits in abundance, many of them unknown to me, but prominent among  them the red, luscious, intoxicating berries that had saved my life in  the desert; and these I now ate greedily, finding them much riper than  when I had first tasted them, and their effect much more potent. They  intoxicated me, perhaps maddened me, and dulled my intellect for the  time; but they gave respite to my pain-racked frame, and gave me sleep.  Sometimes for days I would give myself up to them, eating nothing else,  and lying in a pleasant, dreamy stupor by the deep pool, staring into  the dark, clear depths where the white sand glimmered so white.    At times I roused myself sufficiently to search for other food, of  which there was plenty. Partridges and other fowl swarmed at the water,  and were easily killed or trapped, and there was plenty of t'samma  growing quite close to the spot where I had fallen.    These, since I had now an abundance of water, I did not attempt to eat;  taking only the pips from the ripe ones, drying them in the sun, and  pounding them between two stones, as I had often seen the Bushmen do.  From the coarse meal thus obtained I made little cakes, roasting them  on hot stones or the embers of my fire. Matches I had none, but my  burning glass served me just as well, for every day the sun shone;  indeed seldom did a cloud cross the sky, and whatever storms may have  raged outside nothing but the gentlest breeze ever reached the deep  hollow that held me a willing prisoner. Willing? Well, at least  apathetic; for all hope, all ambition, all interest in life had left  me. I had forgotten the reason of my quest, forgotten the girl who had  sent me on it, forgotten that I was once an erect and vigorous man with  other interests than to crawl round for berries like an ape, and lie  all day and sleep when once hunger was appeased. And thus I led an  invertebrate, purposeless existence. I had warmth, food, and water, and  the berries that gave me pleasant dreams, and I wanted nothing more. I  took no note of the passing of time weeks, months God knows? even  years! may have passed nay must have passed as in a dream, and I might  well have died there beside the long-bleached skeletons of my horses,  but that one day chance or fate led me back to the path of reason. I  had been sleeping off the effects of the berries, and lay, beneath the  shade of a rock close to the pool, idly tossing about the tiny pebbles  of the little patch of shingle close to its brink playing with them as  a child might. And suddenly a glint on the corner of one of these  little stones arrested my wandering attention; there was something  familiar about it, something that stirred memories in my sluggish  brain. What was it? I groped in vain for some clue. The pebble worried  me, and I made a peevish gesture to throw it away. No! Whatever it was,  I must not do that, rather wash it, wash it. Yes! that was what we used  to do. But where was the batea, for now by some strange freak I was  back in Brazil, and must have my batea. We washed our gravel for  diamonds in that wooden prospecting pan--diamonds?    My mind was stirring troubling me now, and with a trembling hand I  thrust the pebble into a handful of others and worked them between my  palms in the water. Yes, there it was, a good stone of ten carats--  slightly encrusted with oxide--a good find. And I? Where was I?    I stood gazing alternately at the stone, and at my surroundings: the  pool, the circle of towering cliffs that hemmed me in, and gradually  the flood-gates of my clouded memory broke loose and I remembered all.    The girl in England, old Anderson, Inyati, and the blue diamond; my  ride and fall; all these came back to me almost in a flash, stunning  and amazing me; but for long the incidents of my life here in the  hollow were vague and misty. The berries! Surely they had been the  cause of my lethargy, and even as I thought of them the desire for them  came upon me. But for the first time I fought it, for in my reawakened  brain other desires were now surging.    Diamonds! Inyati had told me there were plenty in his land; had Fate  with a cruel irony led me into this land of wealth only to maim me and  keep me a lonely prisoner here in this pit till I died!    All this flashed through my mind as I stood and gazed at the stone;  then, righting my inclination for the berries, I plunged into the pool,  and found new strength and resolution in its refreshing coolness. Then  I searched eagerly amongst the other pebbles and found three more  diamonds, all fine big stones; yet not to be compared with the blue  stone Inyati had given me. Where was it? My pack had been scattered by  that terrific fall, but now I remembered the diamond had been sewn  securely into the cartridge belt I had always worn. It must be here now  with my clothes.    For now I realized that I was naked as a savage clothed but in the long  tangled hair on head and chin scarred, blistered and burnt till I  looked like a wild man, as I had indeed become.    And then I remembered my face, the vultures! and looking into the clear  waters of the pool, I saw, for the first time with sane eyes, my  terrible disfigurement, and cried aloud in anguish as I saw what manner  of man I had become, and realized that even if I could escape life was  for me a closed book. Scarred, grotesque, and horrible; what future was  there for me among my fellow beings . . . even though I could return to  them? Again I was sorely tempted to seek the berries that would give me  oblivion from all this agony of regret; but I struggled, and as night  came I slept a natural, refreshing sleep, and awoke with a new-born  hope and determination strong in me. I would not die here as a wild  beast; somehow I would scale the cliffs and escape, or die in the  attempt a better death than to perish like a rat in a trap without a  struggle for liberty.    My head was clearer now than it had been for I know not how long, and I  could reason. And Inyati's diamond was my first thought. I could find  but little trace of my pack; the white bones of my horses were half  buried in sand; a rusty tin here and a few shreds of clothing there  being all that I could find near them. My rifle I found; or rather the  remnants of it, for it had been broken to pieces in the fall, and no  trace of the stock remained. At length in a crevice near the pool I  found my revolver with a number of cartridges, my hunting knife, and a  few odds and ends of clothing, all in a canvas haversack that still  remained strong and sound, and at the bottom my belt and the diamond  tied up with Inyati's bracelet. But the leather belt had perished to a  remarkable degree; it was hard, black, cracked and twisted, and broke  at my first touch; and I found too upon searching for the saddles that  nothing remained of them but some dried fragments. I realized then that  months must have passed since my fall; but even then I had no  conception of the terrible truth! Cheered by the discovery of the blue  diamond, I now determined to look closely for others in the vicinity of  the pool, but days of laborious searching brought no reward except that  the work helped more and more to clear my foggy brain and bring me back  to full sanity. I felt convinced that diamonds were there, not far off,  however, and one day as I vainly sorted over the gravel where I had  found the others, the solution came to me. In the pool, in the white  sand that shone so at the bottom, there I should find them! It was deep  and narrow, this pool, and a difficult task even for a good diver; and  I determined to wait till midday, when the sun shone full on the  bottom. When the time came I plunged in, and a rapid stroke or two took  me to the bottom.    The water was clear as crystal; and now I could see clearly why it had  looked "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21900"],[0,"The Principles of Breeding (#11)"],[1,"related to  it; the muscles covering it in the case of the limbs; and to the  viscera in that of the great cavities which it assists in forming.  Accordingly, in perfect accordance with the views above expressed, the  _general_ size and form which must be mainly that of the _trunk_, will  be determined by the size and character of the viscera of the chest  and abdomen, and will therefore accord with that of the female parents  by whom the viscera in question are chiefly furnished.    The foregoing are the most important of Mr. Orton's statements. He  gives, however, numerous additional illustrations from among beasts,  birds and fishes, of which we quote only the following:    \"The mule and the hinny have been selected and placed first, because  they afford the most conclusive evidence and are the most familiar.  Equally conclusive, though perhaps less striking instances, may be  drawn from other sources. Thus, it has been observed that when the  Ancon or Otter sheep were allowed to breed with common ewes, the cross  is not a medium between the two breeds, but that the offspring retains  in a great measure the short and twisted legs of the sire.\"    Buffon made a cross between the male goat and the ewe; the resulting  hybrid in all the instances, which were many, were strongly  characteristic of the male parent, more particularly in the hair and  length of leg. Curious enough, the number of teats in some of the  cases corresponded with those of the goat.    A cross between the male wolf and a bitch illustrates the same law;  the offspring having a markedly wolfish aspect; skin, color, ears and  tail. On the other hand, a cross between the dog and female wolf  afforded animals much more dog-like in aspect--slouched ears and even  pied in color. If you look at the descriptions and illustrations of  these two hybrids, you will perceive at a glance that the doubt arises  to the mind in the case of the first, 'what genus of _wolf_ is this?'  whereas in the case of the second, 'what a curious _mongrel dog_!'    The views of Mr. Walker in his work on Intermarriage, before alluded  to, agree substantially with those of Mr. Orton, _so far as regards  crossing between different breeds_; but they cover a broader field of  observation and in some respects differ. Mr. Walker maintains that  when both parents are of the _same breed_ that _either parent may  transmit either half_ of the organization. That when they are of  _different varieties_ or breeds (and by parity of reasoning the same  should hold, strongly, when hybrids are produced by crossing different  _species_) and supposing also that both parents are of equal age and  vigor, that the _male_ gives the _back head and locomotive organs_ and  the _female_ the _face and_ nutritive organs--I quote his language:  \"when both parents are of the same variety, _one parent communicates  the anterior part of the head, the bony part of the face, the forms of  the organs of sense_ (the external ear, under lip, lower part of the  nose and eye brows being often modified) _and the whole of the  internal nutritive system_, (the contents of the trunk or the thoracic  and abdominal viscera, and consequently the form of the trunk itself  in so far as that depends on its contents.)    The resemblance to that parent is consequently found in the forehead  and bony parts of the face, as the orbits, cheek bones, jaws, chin and  teeth, as well as the shape of the organs of sense and the tone of the  voice.    _The other parent communicates the posterior part of the head, the  cerebel situated within the skull immediately above its junction with  the back of the neck, and the whole of the locomotive system_; (the  bones, ligaments and muscles or fleshy parts.)    The resemblance to that parent is consequently found in the back head,  the few more movable parts of the face, as the external ear, under  lip, lower part of the nose, eyebrows, and the external forms of the  body, in so far as they depend on the muscles as well as the form of  the limbs, even to the fingers, toes and nails. * *    It is a fact established by my observations that in animals of the  _same variety, either the male or the female parent_ may give _either  series of organs_ as above arranged--that is _either_ forehead and  organs of sense, together with the vital and nutritive organs, _or_  back head, together with the locomotive organs.\"    To show that among domesticated animals organization is transmitted by  halves in the way indicated, and that either parent may give either  series of organs, he cites among other instances the account of the  Ancon sheep. \"When both parents are of the Ancon or Otter breed, their  descendants inherit their peculiar appearance and proportions of form.  When an Ancon ewe is impregnated by a common ram, the progeny  resembles wholly either the ewe or the ram. The progeny of a common  ewe impregnated by an Ancon ram follows entirely in shape the one or  the other without blending any of the distinguishing and essential  peculiarities of both.    'Frequent instances have occurred where common ewes have had twins by  Ancon rams; when one exhibited the complete marks and features of the  ewe and the other of the ram. The contrast has been rendered  singularly striking when one short legged and one long legged lamb  produced at a birth have been sucking the dam at the same time.'    As the short and crooked legs or those of opposite form, here indicate  the parent giving the locomotive system, it is evident that one of  the twins derived it from one parent and the other twin from the other  parent;--the parent not giving it, doubtless communicating in each  case, the vital or nutritive system.\"    Where the parents are of different varieties or species, Mr. Walker  says, \"The second law, namely, that of CROSSING, operates where each  parent is of a _different breed_, and where, supposing both to be of  equal age and vigor the _male_ gives the _back head_ and _locomotive  organs_, and the _female_ the _face_ and _nutritive organs_.\"    After giving numerous illustrations from facts and many quotations  from eminent breeders, he says, \"thus, in crosses of cattle as well as  of horses, the male, except where feebler or of inferior voluntary and  locomotive power, gives the locomotive system, the female the vital  one.\"    W.C. Spooner, V.S., one of the most eminent authorities of the present  day on this subject, and writing within the past year in the Journal  of the Royal Agricultural Society, says:--\"The most probable  supposition is, that propagation is done by halves, each parent giving  to the offspring the shape of one half of the body. Thus the back,  loins, hind-quarters, general shape, skin and size follow one parent;  and the fore-quarters, head, vital and nervous system, the other; and  we may go so far as to add, that the former in the great majority of  cases go with the male parent, and the latter with the female. A  corroboration of this fact is found in the common system of putting an  ordinary mare to a thorough-bred horse; not only does the head of the  offspring resemble the dam but the forelegs likewise, and thus it is  fortunately the case that the too-frequently faulty and tottering legs  of the sire are not reproduced in the foal, whilst the full thighs and  hind quarters which belong to the blood-horse are generally given to  the offspring. There is however a minority of cases in which the  opposite result obtains. That size is governed more by the male parent  there is no great difficulty in showing; familiar examples may be  found in the pony-mare and the full sized horse, which considerably  exceed the dam in size. Again, in the first cross between the small  indigenous ewe and the large ram of another improved breed--the  offspring is found to approach in size and shape very much to the ram.  The mule offspring of the mare also much resembles both in size and  appearance its donkey sire. These are familiar examples of the  preponderating influence of the male parent, so far as the external  form is considered. To show however that size and hight do not  invariably follow the male, we need go no further for illustration  than the human subject. How often do we find that in the by no means  unfrequent case of the union of a tall man with a short woman, the  result in some instances is that all the children are tall and in  others all short; or sometimes that some are short and others tall.  Within our own knowledge in one case, where the father was tall and  the mother short, the children, six in number, are all tall. In  another instance, the father being short and the mother tall, the  children, seven in number, are all of lofty stature. In a third  instance, the mother being tall and the father short, the greater  portion of the family are short. Such facts as these are sufficient to  prove that hight or growth does not exclusively follow either the one  parent or the other. Although this is the case, it is also a striking  fact that the union of tall and short parents rarely, if ever,  produces offspring of a medium size--midway, as it were, between the  two parents.    Thus, in the breeding of animals, if the object be to modify certain  defects by using a male or female in which such defects may not exist,  we cannot produce this desired alteration; or rather it cannot be  equally produced in all the offspring, but can only be attained by  weeding out those in whom the objectionable points are repeated. We  are, however, of opinion that in the majority of instances, the hight  in the human subject, and the size and _contour_ in animals, is  influenced _much more by the male_ than the female parent--and on the  other hand, that the constitution, the chest and vital organs, and the  forehand generally more frequently follow the female.\"    Dr. Carpenter, the highest authority in Physiology, says \"it has long  been a prevalent idea that certain"]]]
