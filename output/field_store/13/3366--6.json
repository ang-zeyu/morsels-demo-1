Hallam applies to Gladstone Diomede's lines about Odysseus, of  eager heart and spirit so manful in all manner of toils, as the only  comrade whom a man would choose.[30] But the Greek hero was no doubt a  complex character, and the parallel is taken by Gladstone as an  equivocal compliment. So Hallam begs him at any rate to accept the other  description, how when he uttered his mighty voice from his chest, and  words fell like flakes of snow in winter, then could no mortal man  contend with Odysseus.[31] As happy a forecast for the great orator of  their generation, as when in 1829 he told Gladstone that Tennyson  promised fair to be its greatest poet. Hallam's share in the  correspondence reminds us of the friendship of two other Etonians ninety  years before, of the letters and verses that Gray wrote to Richard West;  there is the same literary sensibility, the same kindness, but there is  what Gray and West felt not, the breath of a busy and changing age. Each  of these two had the advantage of coming from a home where politics were  not mere gossip about persons and paragraphs, but were matters of  trained and continued interest. The son of one of the most eminent of  the brilliant band of the whig writers of that day, Hallam passes  glowing eulogies on the patriotism and wisdom of the whigs in coalescing  with Canning against the bigotry of the king and the blunders of  Wellington and Peel; he contrasts this famous crisis with a similar  crisis in the early part of the reign of George III.; and observes how  much higher all parties stood in the balance of disinterestedness and  public virtue. He goes to the opera and finds Zucchelli admirable,  Coradori divine. He wonders (1826) about Sir Walter's forthcoming life  of Napoleon, how with his ultra principles Scott will manage to make a  hero of the Corsican. He asks if Gladstone has read 'the new _Vivian  Grey_' (1827)--the second part of that amazing fiction into which an  author, not much older than themselves and destined to strange historic  relations with one of them, had the year before burst upon the world.  Hallam is not without the graceful melancholy of youth, so different  from that other melancholy of ripe years and the deepening twilight.  Under all is the recurrent note of a grave refrain that fatal issues  made pathetic.    'Never since the time when I first knew you,' Hallam wrote to Gladstone  (June 23, 1830), 'have I ceased to love and respect your character ...  It will be my proudest thought that I may henceforth act worthily of  their affection who, like yourself, have influenced my mind for good in  the earliest season of its development. Circumstance, my dear Gladstone,  has indeed separated our paths, but it can never do away with what has  been. The stamp of each of our minds is on the other. Many a habit of  thought in each is modified, many a feeling is associated, which never  would have existed in that combination, had it not been for the old  familiar days when we lived together.'    In the summer of 1827 Hallam quitted Eton for the journey to Italy that  set so important a mark on his literary growth, and he bade his friend  farewell in words of characteristic affection. 'Perhaps you will pardon  my doing by writing what I hardly dare trust myself to do by words. I  received your superb Burke yesterday; and hope to find it a memorial of  past and a pledge for future friendship through both our lives. It is  perhaps rather bold in me to ask a favour immediately on acknowledging  so great a one; but you would please me, and oblige me greatly, if you  will accept this copy of my father's book. It may serve when I am  separated from you, to remind you of one, whose warmest pleasure it will  always be to subscribe himself, Your most faithful friend, A. H. H.'    A few entries from the schoolboy's diary may serve to bring the daily  scene before us, and show what his life was like:--         _October 3, 1826._--Holiday. Walk with Hallam.

He writes to  his sister his last Etonian letter (December 2) before departure, and  'melancholy that departure is.' On the day before, he had made his  valedictory speech to the Society, and the empty shelves and dismantled  walls, the table strewn with papers, the books packed away in their  boxes, have the effect of 'mingling in one lengthened mass all the  boyish hopes and solicitudes and pleasures' of his Eton life. 'I have  long ago made up my mind that I have of late been enjoying what will in  all probability be, as far as my own individual case is concerned, the  happiest years of my life. And they have fled! From these few facts do  we not draw a train of reflections awfully important in their nature and  extremely powerful in their impression on the mind?'                                  DR. KEATE    Two reminiscences of Eton always gave him, and those who listened to  him, much diversion whenever chance brought them to his mind, and he has  set them down in an autobiographic fragment, for which this is the  place:--         To Dr. Keate nature had accorded a stature of only about five feet,       or say five feet one; but by costume, voice, manner (including a       little swagger), and character he made himself in every way the       capital figure on the Eton stage, and his departure marked, I       imagine, the departure of the old race of English public school       masters, as the name of Dr. Busby seems to mark its introduction.       In connection with his name I shall give two anecdotes separated by       a considerable interval of years. About the year 1820, the       eloquence of Dr. Edward Irving drew crowds to his church in London,       which was presbyterian. It required careful previous arrangements       to secure comfortable accommodation. The preacher was solemn,       majestic (notwithstanding the squint), and impressive; carrying all       the appearance of devoted earnestness. My father had on a certain       occasion, when I was still a small Eton boy, taken time by the       forelock, and secured the use of a convenient pew in the first rank       of the gallery. From this elevated situation we surveyed at ease       and leisure the struggling crowds below. The crush was everywhere       great, but greatest of all in the centre aisle. Here the mass of       human beings, mercilessly compressed, swayed continually backwards       and forwards. There was I, looking down with infinite complacency       and satisfaction from this honourable vantage ground upon the floor       of the church, filled and packed as one of our public meetings is,       with people standing and pushing. What was my emotion, my joy, my       exultation, when I espied among this humiliated mass, struggling       and buffeted--whom but Keate! Keate the master of our existence,       the tyrant of our days! Pure, unalloyed, unadulterated rapture!       Such a [Greek: peripeteia], such a reversal of human conditions of being,       as that now exhibited between the Eton lower boy uplifted to the       luxurious gallery pew, and the head-master of Eton, whom I was       accustomed to see in the roomy deck of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],[0,"Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#11)"],[1,"_make_ yourself keep quiet,\" quoth Miss Rhoda, with an  air of wisdom which evidently impressed her hearers.  They glanced first  at her and then at each other, and the glance said plainly as words  could speak that here was a girl who had strength of mind--a girl who  would make her mark in the school!    \"I'll try!\" said Kathleen, meekly.  \"I am terribly anxious about this  exam., for if I do well and pass better than any one else in the school  I shall get a scholarship of L40 towards next year's fees.  That would  be a great help to my parents, for they are poor, and have only sent me  here that I may have a chance of getting on and being able to teach some  day.  I should be so thankful if I could help, for it's horrid to know  the people at home are stinting themselves for your sake.  I lie awake  at nights imagining that the report is in, and I am first, and then I  write a long letter home and tell them about it.  Each time I invent a  fresh letter, and they are so touching, you can't think!  I cried over  one, one night, and Tom came round to see what was the matter.  At other  times I imagine I'm plucked, and I go cold all over; I think I should  _die_!  Never mind, nine months yet!  I'll work like a slave, and if I  _do_ fail no one can say it's my own fault.\"    \"You won't fail.  Don't imagine anything so horrible!  You will get over  your nervousness and do splendidly, and write your letter in real  earnest,\" cried Dorothy cheerily.  \"I am going in for the Oxford too,  but you need fear no rival in me.  I am one of those deadly,  uninteresting creatures, who never reach anything but a fair medium.  There isn't a `distinction' in me, and one could never be first at that  rate.  A scrape-through pass is all _I'm_ good for!\"    \"I could get two distinctions at once!  I know more German and French  than ninety girls out of a hundred.  Two distinctions!  It's a big  start.  I wonder--I wonder if I could possibly be first!\" said Rhoda to  herself, and her breath came fast, and her cheeks grew suddenly hot.  \"Nine months!  Nine months!\"  If she studied hard, and worked up the  subjects on which she was behind, might she not have a chance with the  rest?  The first girl!  Oh, if only it could be possible, what joy, what  rapture!  What a demonstration of power before the school.  She went off  into a blissful dream in which she stood apart, receiving the  congratulations of Miss Bruce and her staff, and saw Thomasina's face  regarding her with a new expression of awe.  Then she came back to real  life, to look remorsefully at her new friend, and notice for the first  time her pinched and anxious air.    \"But I would give Kathleen the money.  I want nothing but the honour,\"  she assured herself, shutting her mind obstinately against the  conviction that such a division might not be altogether easy to arrange.  \"And Dorothy is going in, too; lots of girls are going in, so why  should not I?  And if I enter I must do my best; nobody could object to  that!\"    Nevertheless there was an unaccountable weight on her heart, which made  it a relief when the subject dropped, and Kathleen began to point out  the various out-buildings scattered over the grounds.    \"That's the pavilion.  We keep all the games there, and it's so nicely  furnished.  There is quite a pretty sitting-room, and a stove, and all  the materials for making tea.  On Saturday afternoons the winning teams  may stay behind and have tea there by themselves, and buy cakes from the  housekeeper.  It's ripping!  We look forward to it as the Saturday  treat, and aren't you just mad if your side loses!  That's the joiner's  shop.  You can have lessons if you like, and learn to make all sorts of  things; but I've no ambition to be a carpenter, so I don't go...  That's  a summer-house, but it's so earwiggy that we leave it alone...  That was  meant to be a swimming-bath, but the water comes straight from a well,  and it is so deadly cold that the girls got cramp, and Miss Bruce  forbade them to use it any more.  It looks wretchedly deserted now.  If  you want to be miserable all by yourself you couldn't have a better  place.  It's so still and dark, and the birds have built their nests in  the corners, and come suddenly flying past, and frighten you out of your  wits...  Those little patches are the girls' own gardens.  You can have  lessons in gardening, and get a prize if you are clever.  I don't go in  for that either, for it's an extra expense.\"    \"Oh, I must have a garden!\" cried Rhoda quickly.  \"I adore flowers, and  they could send me cuttings from home.  I always had my own garden, but  I didn't do the work, of course.  I just said how it was to be arranged,  and what plants I wanted, and every one admired it, and said how  successful it was.  I had big clumps of things, you know; not one  straggling plant here and another there, but all banked up together.  You should have seen my lily bed!  I made the men collect all the odd  bulbs and plant them together, and they were a perfect show.  The scent  met you half-way down the path; it was almost overpowering.  And then I  had a lot of the new cactus dahlias, and left only about two branches on  each, so that they came up like one huge bush with all the lovely  contrasting colours.  Many people say they don't like dahlias, but that  is only because they haven't seen them properly grown.\"    \"Oh well, I loathe them myself, and I always shall do.  You never get  any satisfaction out of them, however pretty they may be, for as soon as  people see them, they begin groaning and saying, `Oh, dear, dear, autumn  flowers already!  How sad it is.  Winter will soon be upon us.'\"  Dorothy sniffed derisively.  It was evident that no support was to be  expected from her on the dahlia question, and Rhoda felt that only time  and experience could prove to her the folly of her position.    When all the out-buildings had been explained, Kathleen led the way down  a winding path which seemed to lead to nowhere in particular, but rather  to come to an abrupt _cul-de-sac_ in the shape of a high grey wall.  Her  companions wondered at her choice, but she went forward with an air of  determination, so that there was nothing left but to follow, and hope  soon to return to more interesting scenes.  When she came to the end of  the path, however, she stood still and began to smile with a most  baffling air of mystery.  What did it mean?  What were they expected to  see?  The girls wheeled to and fro, looked at the paths, the beds, the  flowers, frowned in bewilderment, and then suddenly lifted their eyes to  the wall, and uttered simultaneous exclamations of surprise.    The wall was dotted over with little tablets of stone, on each of which  was a neatly engraved inscription, and each inscription bore the name of  a girl at its head.  Rhoda craned forward and read first one and then  another:    \"...Winifred Barton, joined Hurst Manor, September, 189--, left  Christmas, 189--.  The youngest pupil who ever obtained honours in  Mathematics in the Oxford Local Examinations.\"    \"Elizabeth Charrington, an old pupil of the school, obtained First Class  in the Honours School of Modern History at Oxford.\"    \"Eleanor Newman, joined Hurst Manor, September, 189--, left Mid., 189--.  Beloved by her fellow-students as the kindest and most loyal of  friends, the most unselfish of competitors.  Held in grateful  remembrance for the power of her influence and example.\"    \"Fanny Elder.  For two years Games President of the school.  Winner of  the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Tournament, 189--.  Holder of Edinburgh Golf  Cup, 189--.  A just and fearless sportswoman...\"    The list of names went on indefinitely, but Rhoda had read enough to  inflame curiosity, and wheeled eagerly round to confront Kathleen.    \"What is it?  What does it mean?  Who puts them up?  Is it just the  cleverest girls?--\"    \"It's the Record Wall!\" said Kathleen.  \"We are very proud of our Record  Wall at Hurst.  The cost of these tablets is paid by the pupils  themselves, and they are put up entirely at their discretion.  The  teachers have nothing to do with it.  If a girl has distinguished  herself at work, but is conceited and overbearing, and makes herself  disliked, no one wants to put up a tablet to _her_; so it is really a  testimony to character, as well as to cleverness.  Eleanor Newman was  quite stupid, they say.  I never knew her.  She never passed a single  examination, nor took a prize nor anything, yet every one loved her.  She was a little, fair thing, with curly hair too short to tie back, and  soft, grey eyes.  She wasn't a bit goody, but she always seemed waiting  to do kind things, and make peace, and cheer the girls when they were  home-sick.  And no one ever heard her say a cross word, or make an  uncharitable remark.\"    \"And did she die?\" croaked Rhoda solemnly.  A long experience of girls'  stories had taught her that when girls were sweet and fair, and never  said an unkind word, they invariably caught a chill, and died of rapid  consumption.  She expected to hear the same report of Eleanor Newman,  but Kathleen replied briskly:    \"Die!  Not a bit of it.  She married, at nineteen, a doctor down in  Hampshire, and brought him to see the school on their honeymoon.  The  Greens escorted her in a body to the Record Wall, and when she saw her  own name she covered her face with her hands, and flew for her life.  And her husband looked quite weepy.  The girls said he could hardly  speak!\"    \"Ah-h!\" sighed Rhoda, and was silent.  She felt \"weepy\" too, filled with  a sudden yearning, a sudden realisation of want.  Eleanor Newman had  risen to heights to which she could never attain.  \"A little, fair  thing, and almost stupid,\" yet her school-fellows loved her, and  immortalised her name in words of grateful loyalty.  She sighed again,  and yet again, and heard Kathleen's voice cry sharply--    \"Oh, I look at that empty space, and wonder if"]]]
