A new Ministry was formed under Rockingham pledged to make  peace. Franklin again went to Paris as representative of the  Confederation and showed himself a diplomatist of the first rank. To the  firmness with which he maintained the Alliance against the most skilful  attempts to dissolve it must largely be attributed the successful  conclusion of a general peace on terms favourable to the Allies and  especially favourable to America. Britain recognized the independence of  her thirteen revolted colonies, and peace was restored.    I have said that England recognized her thirteen revolted colonies. She  did not recognize the American Republic, for as yet there was none to  recognize. The war had been conducted on the American side nominally by  the Continental Congress, an admittedly _ad hoc_ authority not  pretending to permanency; really by Washington and his army which, with  the new flag symbolically emblazoned with thirteen stars and thirteen  stripes, was the one rallying point of unity. That also was now to be  dissolved. The States had willed to be free, and they were free. Would  they, in their freedom, will effectively to be a nation? That was a  question which not the wisest observer could answer at the time, and  which was not perhaps fully answered until well within the memory of men  still living. Its solution will necessarily form the main subject of  this book.                                        CHAPTER III                               \"WE, THE PEOPLE\"      An account of the American Revolution which took cognizance only of the  armed conflict with England would tell much less than half the truth,  and even that half would be misleading. If anyone doubts that the real  inspiration which made America a nation was drawn, not from Whiggish  quarrels about taxes, but from the great dogmas promulgated by  Jefferson, it is sufficient to point out that the States did not even  wait till their victory over England was assured before effecting a  complete internal revolution on the basis of those dogmas. Before the  last shot had been fired almost the last privilege had disappeared.    The process was a spontaneous one, and its fruits appear almost  simultaneously in every State. They can be followed best in Virginia,  where Jefferson himself took the lead in the work of revolutionary  reform.    Hereditary titles and privileges went first. On this point public  feeling became so strong that the proposal to form after the war a  society to be called \"the Cincinnati,\" which was to consist of those who  had taken a prominent part in the war and afterwards of their  descendants, was met, in spite of the respect in which Washington and  the other military heroes were held, with so marked an expression of  public disapproval that the hereditary part of the scheme had to be  dropped.    Franchises were simplified, equalized, broadened, so that in practically  every State the whole adult male population of European race received  the suffrage. Social and economic reforms having the excellent aim of  securing and maintaining a wide distribution of property, especially of  land, were equally prominent among the achievements of that time.  Jefferson himself carried in Virginia a drastic code of Land Laws,  which anticipated many of the essential provisions which through the  _Code Napoleon_ revolutionized the system of land-owning in Europe. As  to the practical effect of such reforms we have the testimony of a man  whose instinct for referring all things to practice was, if anything, an  excess, and whose love for England was the master passion of his life.  \"Every object almost that strikes my view,\" wrote William Cobbett many  years later, \"sends my mind and heart back to England. In viewing the  ease and happiness of this people the contrast fills my soul with  indignation, and makes it more and more the object of my life to assist  in the destruction of the diabolical usurpation which has trampled on  king as well as people.\"    Another principle, not connected by any direct logic with democracy and  not set forth in the Declaration of Independence, was closely associated  with the democratic thesis by the great French thinkers by whom that  thesis was revived, and had a strong hold upon the mind of Jefferson--the  principle of religious equality, or, as it might be more exactly defined,  of the Secular State.    So many loose and absurd interpretations of this principle have been and  are daily being propounded, that it may be well to state succinctly what  it does and does not mean.    It does not mean that anyone may commit any anti-social act that appeals  to him, and claim immunity from the law on the ground that he is impelled  to that act by his religion; can rob as a conscientious communist, murder  as a conscientious Thug, or refuse military service as a conscientious  objector. None understood better than Jefferson--it was the first principle  of his whole political system--that there must be _some_ basis of  agreement amongst citizens as to what is right and what is wrong, and that  what the consensus of citizens regards as wrong must be punished by the  law. All that the doctrine of the Secular State asserted was that such  general agreement among citizens need not include, as in most modern States  it obviously does not include, an agreement on the subject of religion.  Religion is, so to speak, left out of the Social Contract, and consequently  each individual retains his natural liberty to entertain and promulgate  what views he likes concerning it, so long as such views do not bring him  into conflict with those general principles of morality, patriotism and  social order upon which the citizens of the State _are_ agreed, and  which form the basis of its laws.    The public mind of America was for the most part well prepared for the  application of this principle. We have already noted how the first  experiment in the purely secular organization of society had been made  in the Catholic colony of Maryland and the Quaker colony of Pennsylvania.  The principle was now applied in its completeness to one State after  another. The Episcopalian establishment of Jefferson's own State was the  first to fall; the other States soon followed the example of Virginia.    At the same time penalties or disabilities imposed as a consequence of  religious opinions were everywhere abrogated. Only in New England was  there any hesitation. The Puritan States did not take kindly to the idea  of tolerating Popery. In the early days of the revolution their leaders  had actually made it one of the counts of their indictment against the  British Government that that Government had made peace with Anti-Christ  in French Canada--a fact remembered to the permanent hurt of the  Confederacy when the French Canadians were afterwards invited to make  common cause with the American rebels. But the tide was too strong even  for Calvinists to resist; the equality of all religions before the law  was recognized in every State, and became, as it remains to-day, a  fundamental part of the American Constitution.    It may be added that America affords the one conspicuous example of the  Secular State completely succeeding. In France, where the same principles  were applied under the same inspiration, the ultimate result was something  wholly different: an organized Atheism persecuting the Christian Faith.  In England the principle has never been avowedly applied at all. In theory  the English State still professes the form of Protestant Christianity  defined in the Prayer-book, and \"tolerates\" dissenters from it as the  Christian States of the middle ages tolerated the Jews, and as in France,  during the interval between the promulgation of the Edict of Nantes and  its revocation, a State definitely and even pronouncedly Catholic  tolerated the Huguenots. Each dissentient religious body claims its right  to exist in virtue of some specific Act of Parliament. Theoretically it  is still an exception, though the exceptions have swallowed the rule.    Moreover, even under this rather hazy toleration, those who believe  either more or less than the bulk of their fellow-countrymen and who  boldly proclaim their belief usually find themselves at a political  disadvantage. In America it never seems to have been so. Jefferson  himself, a Deist (the claim sometimes made that he was a \"Christian\"  seems to rest on nothing more solid than the fact that, like nearly all  the eighteenth-century Deists, he expressed admiration for the character  and teaching of Jesus Christ), never for a moment forfeited the  confidence of his countrymen on that account, though attempts were made,  notably by John Adams, to exploit it against him. Taney, a Catholic, was  raised without objection on that score to the first judicial post in  America, at a date when such an appointment would have raised a serious  tumult in England. At a later date Ingersoll was able to vary the  pastime of \"Bible-smashing\" with the profession of an active Republican  wire-puller, without any of the embarrassments which that much better  and honester man, Charles Bradlaugh, had to encounter. The American  Republic has not escaped the difficulties and problems which are  inevitable to the Secular State, when some of its citizens profess a  religion which brings them into conflict with the common system of  morals which the nation takes for granted; the case of the Mormons is a  typical example of such a problem. But there is some evidence that, as  the Americans have applied the doctrine far more logically than we, they  have also a keener perception of the logic of its limitations. At any  rate, it is notable that Congress has refused, in its Conscription Act,  to follow our amazing example and make the conscience of the criminal  the judge of the validity of legal proceedings against him.

[Illustration: Fig. 80.--Panicum Isachne.]      =Panicum Isachne, _Roth._=    This is an annual grass usually growing in tufts with fine fibrous roots  and many slender spreading branches, all of them at first creeping and  horizontal, rooting at the nodes and then becoming erect and varying in  length from 1 to 2 feet.    Stems are very slender, glabrous or covered with scattered hairs,  purplish or pale green, and branching freely towards the base.    The _leaf-sheath_ is shorter than the internodes, green or purplish,  striate, externally hairy with scattered bulbous-based hairs, varying in  length from 1/2 to 3 inches, the outer margin of the sheath is ciliate  with long hairs and at the mouths sometimes long hairs are present,  especially when the leaves are young. The _ligule_ is merely a dense  fringe of long hairs. _Nodes_ are tumid, purplish, covered with long  hairs.    The _leaf-blade_ is flat but convolute when young, lanceolate or  linear-lanceolate, acuminate, base rounded and margin with minute  serrations. It is glabrous or occasionally hairy with scattered,  tubercle-based, deciduous hairs, and varying in length from 1 to 3  inches generally (sometimes in well-grown plants it is 5 inches) and in  breadth from 1/8 to 1/4 inch. The midrib is prominent though slender at  the base and four veins are present on each side with five or six  smaller ones between them.    [Illustration: Fig. 81.--Panicum Isachne.    1 and 1a. Front and back view of a spike; 2 and 2a. back and front views  of a spikelet; 3 and 4. the first and the second glume, respectively; 5  and 5a. the third glume and its palea; 6 and 6a. the fourth glume and  its palea; 7. lodicules, anthers and ovary; 8. grain.]    The _inflorescence_ is an erect, narrow panicle consisting of spikes  varying in number from 5 to 12 and in length from 2 to 3 inches. The  _spikes_ are erect, pressed to the very slender rachis, longer than the  internodes of the main rachis, stalked or sessile, mostly simple but  sometimes the lower dividing into two or three branches, 1/2 to 1 inch  long. The rachis of the spike is very slender, angular, flexuous,  narrower than the spikelets, scaberulous with a few long cilia at the  angles.    The _spikelets_ are very small, 1/16 inch long, turned all to one side  and closely packed in two rows, oblong or oval-oblong, obtuse or  subacute, softly hairy, pale green or purplish, with very short pedicels  which are pubescent with a few long hairs towards the thickened cupular  tips.    There are four _glumes_ in the spikelet. The _first glume_ is very  small, membranous, glabrous, broader than long, cordate or triangular,  broadly but shallowly emarginate, nerveless or very obscurely 1- to  2-nerved. The _second glume_ is pale or purplish, 5-nerved, hairy, as  long as the third glume, membranous, oblong and obtuse. The _third  glume_ is pale, nearly equal to the second glume with a longitudinal  depression at the back, less hairy than the second glume, 3-nerved  (rarely 5-nerved also); _palea_ is present, and it is hyaline, shorter  than the glume, truncate or shallowly retuse, usually barren but  occasionally with three stamens. The _fourth glume_ is oblong, rounded,  coriaceous, smooth, shining, dorsally flattened, 3- or indistinctly  5-nerved; _palea_ is similar to the glume in texture and with folded  margins. There are three _stamens_ with yellow anthers. _Lodicules_ are  two, very small and distinct. _Ovary_ has two styles with feathery  _stigmas_ white at first, but turning deep purple while withering.    This delicate and small grass occurs here and there as mere tufts  especially in sheltered situations. It usually flourishes in black  cotton soils amidst cholam (_Andropogon Sorghum_), although it thrives  equally well in other rich soils. This is considered to be a very good  fodder grass.    _Distribution._--It is fairly common all over the Madras Presidency, and  goes up to 3,000 or 4,000 feet. It occurs in Africa, America and Italy.    [Illustration: Fig. 82.--Panicum flavidum.]      =Panicum flavidum, _Retz._=    This plant is a tufted annual. It branches freely from the base;  branches are tufted, decumbent at first but soon becoming erect,  slender, glabrous, compressed and leafy, varying in length from 1 to 3  feet.    Leaves are somewhat distichous. The _leaf-sheath_ is compressed,  glabrous, sometimes with a tinge of purple, the lower ones swollen at  the base and the mouth is hairy. The _ligule_ is a fringe of hairs.  Nodes are glabrous.    The _leaf-blade_ is flat, thinly coriaceous, linear-lanceolate and  acuminate, or ligulate with a rounded tip, 3 to 5 inches in length, 3/16  to 5/16 inch wide, glabrous or very thinly scaberulous, base rounded or  slightly cordate with long white ciliate hairs on the small basal lobes.    [Illustration: Fig. 83.--Panicum flavidum.    1 and 2. Front and back view of a portion of spike; 1a and 2a. the front  and back view of a spikelet; 3 and 4. the first and the second glume,  respectively; 5 and 5a. the third glume and its palea; 6 and 6a. the  fourth glume and its palea; 7. anthers and ovary; 8. grain.]    The _inflorescence_ is a raceme of spikes, 5 to 10 inches long, erect or  inclined on a short or long, glabrous, strongly channelled peduncle; the  main rachis is grooved, angled and scaberulous. _Spikes_ are few or  many, 1/4 to 1 inch long, erect, pressing on the rachis of the  inflorescence along the groove, distant and sessile; the lower spikes  are very much shorter than the internodes, but the upper equal to or  longer than the internodes; the rachis of the spike is angular,  flattened below, erect or slightly recurved.    The _spikelets_ are white, in two rows on a flattened rachis, obliquely  ovoid or gibbously globose, glabrous, sessile, 1/8 inch in length.    There are four _glumes_. The _first glume_ is suborbicular, about half  the length of the third glume, usually 3-nerved. The _second glume_ is  broadly ovate, obtuse, concave, larger than the first glume and nearly  equal to or shorter than the fourth glume, 7-nerved, rarely 7- to  9-nerved, nerves are anastomosing, tip rounded. The _third glume_ is  broadly ovate or oblong, equal to or longer than the fourth glume,  obtuse, 3- to 5-nerved, paleate, mostly with and rarely without stamens.  The _anthers_ are yellow and they do not open until the stigmas and  anthers of the fourth glume are thrown out. _Lodicules_ are two and  conspicuous. _Palea_ is hyaline with infolded margins. The _fourth  glume_ is coriaceous, broadly ovate, tip acutely pointed and almost  cuspidate or acute, mucronate, white or brownish, reticulately minutely  pitted. _Anthers_ are three and yellow. _Stigmas_ are purplish.  _Lodicules_ are small but conspicuous.    This grass is very common throughout the plains and grows in the bunds  of paddy fields and in wet situations, and goes up to moderate  elevations on the hills. Cattle eat this grass greedily and seem to like  it. It is considered to be an excellent fodder.    _Distribution._--In wet situations all over India ascending to 6,000  feet. Occurs also in Ceylon, Africa, Tropical Asia and Australia.    [Illustration: Fig. 84.--Panicum fluitans.]      =Panicum fluitans, _Retz._=    This is a perennial grass with prostrate branches which afterwards  become erect towards the free ends. The young branches are covered with  scale-leaves. Stems are stout, glabrous, smooth and hollow, rooting at  the lower nodes.    The _leaf-sheath_ is loose, glabrous, striate, margins not ciliate. The  _ligule_ is a ridge with a row of erect long hairs. _Nodes_ are  glabrous.    The _leaf-blade_ is firm, linear, finely acuminate, base rounded, rather  narrower than the sheath at the white band, very thinly scaberulous  above and glabrous below, veins prominent above, 3 to 9 inches long, 1/4  to 7/16 inch broad; margins are slightly incurved and the midrib is  conspicuous only at the lower portion of the blade. The scale-leaves  persist at the base of the stems.    [Illustration: Fig. 85.--Panicum fluitans.    1 and 2. Front and back view of a spike; 1a. and 2a. front and back view  of a spikelet; 3, 4 and 5. first, second and third glume respectively;  5a. palea of the third glume and stamens in it; 6 and 6a. fourth glume  and its palea; 7. stamens and ovary.]    The _inflorescence_ is a compound spike varying in length from 4 to 10  inches, erect; the main rachis is triquetrous, dorsally rounded,  glabrous and very thinly scaberulous at the edges. _Spikes_ are many  (fifteen and more), sessile, secund, generally longer than the  internodes, and appressed to the rachis, 1/4 to 1-1/2 inches long; the  rachis of the spike is angular, edges scaberulous and with very fine  short hairs.    The _spikelets_ are pale, ovoid, acute, biseriate, imbricate, very  shortly pedicellate, glabrous, 1/16 to 1/8 inch, pedicels are hairy with  a few long hairs towards the base.    There are four _glumes_. The _first glume_ is white, thin, membranous,  truncate and wavy at the apex, nerveless or sometimes with one to three  short nerves, less than one-third of the third glume, broader than long  and clasping at the base.
