Then to them spake Bhima's daughter--\"In all realms be this your speech,      Wheresoever men assemble--this repeat again, again:      Whither went'st thou then, oh gamester!--half my garment severing off,      Leaving me within the forest--all forsaken, thy beloved.      Even as thou commandedst, sits she--sadly waiting thy return.      Parched with sorrow sits that woman--in her scant half garment glad.      Oh to her thus ever weeping--in the extreme of her distress,      Grant thy pity, noble hero--answer to her earnest prayer.      Be this also said, to move him--to compassionate my state,      (By the wind within the forest--fanned, intensely burns the fire).[117]      Ever by her consort cherished--and sustained the wife should be.      Why hast thou forgot that maxim--thou in every duty skilled.      Thou wert ever called the generous--thou the gentle and the wise.      Art thou now estranged from pity--through my sad injurious fate.      Prince of men, O grant thy pity--grant it, lord of men, to me;      'Mercy is the chief of duties,'--oft from thine own lips I've heard.      Thus as ye are ever speaking--should there any one reply,      Mark him well, lest he be Nala--who he is, and where he dwells.      He who to this speech hath listened--and hath thus his answer made,      Be his words, O best of Brahmins--treasured and brought home to me,      Lest he haply should discover--that by my command ye speak,      That again ye may approach him--do ye this without delay.      Whether he be of the wealthy--whether of the poor he be;      Be he covetous of riches--learn ye all he would desire.\"      Thus addressed, went forth the Brahmins--to the realms on every side,      Seeking out the royal Nala--in his dark concealed distress.      They through royal cities, hamlets--pastoral dwellings, hermits' cells,      Nala every-where went seeking--yet those Brahmins found him not.      All in every part went speaking--in the language they were taught;      In the words of Damayanti--spake they in the ears of men.          BOOK XVIII.          Long the time that passed, a Brahmin--wise Parnada was his name,      Home returning to the city--thus to Bhima's daughter spake:      \"Damayanti! royal Nala--as I sought Nishadha's king,      Came I to Ayodhya's city--the Bhangasuri's abode.      Stood before me, eager listening--to the words thou bad'st us speak,      He, the prosperous Rituparna--all excelling! such his name.      Thus as spake I, answered nothing--Rituparna, king of men;      Nor of all that full assemblage--more than once addressed by me.      By the king dismissed, when sate I--in a solitary place,      One of Rituparna's household--Vahuca, his name, drew near,      Charioteer of that great raja--with short arms and all deformed,      Skilled to drive the rapid chariot--skilled the viands to prepare.      He, when much he'd groaned in anguish--and had wept again, again,      First his courteous salutation--made, then spake in words like these:      Even in the extreme of misery--noble women still preserve,      Over their ownselves the mastery--by their virtues winning heaven;      Of their faithless lords abandoned--anger feel not even then.      In the breastplate of their virtue--noble women live unharmed.      By the wretched, by the senseless--by the lost to every joy,      She by such a lord forsaken--yet to anger will not yield.      Against him his sustenance seeking--of his robe by birds despoiled,      Him consumed with utmost misery--still no wrath the dark-hued feels;      Treated well, or ill entreated--when her husband she beholds,      Spoiled of bliss, bereft of kingdom--famine-wasted, worn with woe.      Having heard the stranger's language--hither hasted I to come.      Thou hast heard, be thine the judgment--to the king relate thou all.\"      To Parnada having listened--with her eyes o'erflowed with tears,      Secretly went Damayanti--and her mother thus addressed:      \"Let not what I speak to Bhima--O my mother, be made known--      In thy presence to Sudeva--best of Brahmins, I would speak.      Let not this my secret counsel--to king Bhima be disclosed;      This the object we must compass--if thy daughter thou wouldst please,      As myself was to my kindred--swiftly by Sudeva brought,      With the same good fortune swiftly--may Sudeva part from hence,      Home to bring the royal Nala--mother, to Ayodhya's town.\"        Resting from his toil, Parnada--of the Brahmin race the best,      Did the daughter of Vidarbha--honour, and with wealth reward.      \"Brahmin! home if come my Nala--richer guerdon will I give;      Much hast thou achieved, and wisely--so as none but thou has done.      That again with my lost husband--noblest Brahmin, I may meet.\"      Thus addressed, his grateful homage--and his benedictions paid,      Having thus achieved his mission--home the wise Parnada went.        Then accosting good Sudeva--Damayanti thus began,      And before her mother's presence--in her pain and grief she spake:      \"Go, Sudeva, to the city--where Ayodhya's raja dwells,      Speak thou thus to Rituparna--Come, as of thine own accord.      Once again her Swayembara--does king Bhima's daughter hold;      Damayanti, thither hasten--all the kings and sons of kings;      Closely now the time is reckoned--when to-morrow's dawn appears;      If that thou would'st win the Princess--speed thou, tamer of thy foes.      When the sun is in his rising--she a second lord will choose:      Whether lives or is not living--royal Nala, no one knows.\"      Thus, as he received his mission--hastening to the king, he spake,      To the royal Rituparna--spake Sudeva, in these words.          BOOK XIX.          Hearing thus Sudeva's language--Rituparna, king of men      With a gentle voice and blandly--thus to Vahuca began.      \"Where the princess Damayanti--doth her Swayembara hold      In one day to far Vidarbha--Vahuca, I fain would go.\"      In these words the unknown Nala--by his royal lord addressed      All his heart was torn with anguish--thus the lofty-minded thought--      \"Can she speak thus, Damayanti--thus with sorrow frantic act?      Is't a stratagem thus subtly--for my sake devised and plann'd?      To desire this deed unholy[118]--is that holy princess driven      Wrong'd by me, her basest husband--miserable, mind-estranged!      Fickle is the heart of woman--grievous too is my offence!      Hence she thus might act ignobly--in her exile, reft of friends,      Soul-disturbed by her great sorrow--in the excess of her despair.      No! she could not thus have acted--she with noble offspring blest.      Where the truth, and where the falsehood--setting forth, I best shall judge,      I the will of Rituparna--for mine own sake, will obey.\"      Thus within his mind revolving--Vahuca, his wretched mind,      With his folded hands addressed he--Rituparna, king of men:      \"I thy mandate will accomplish--I will go, O king of men,      In a single day, O raja--to Vidarbha's royal town.\"      Vahuca of all the coursers--did a close inspection make      Entering in the royal stable--by Bhangasuri's command.      Ever urged by Rituparna--Vahuca, in horses skilled,      Long within himself debating--which the fleetest steeds to choose,      He approached four slender coursers--fit, and powerful for the road,      Blending mighty strength with fleetness--high in courage and in blood;      Free from all the well-known vices--broad of nostril--large of jaw;      With the ten good marks distinguished[119]--born in Sindhu[120]--fleet as          wind.      As he gazed upon those coursers--spoke the king, almost in wrath:      \"Is then thus fulfilled our mandate?--think not to deceive us so.      How will these my coursers bear us--slight in strength and slightly          breathed--      How can such a way be travelled--and so long, by steeds like these?\"--        VAHUCA _spake_.        \"Two on th' head, one on the forehead--two and two on either flank--      Two, behold, the chest discloses--and upon the crupper one--      These the horses to Vidharba--that will bear us, doubt not thou;      Yet, if others thou preferest--speak, and I will yoke them straight.\"        RITUPARNA _spake_.        \"In the knowledge thou of horses--Vahuca, hast matchless skill;      Whichso'er thou think'st the fittest--harness thou without delay.\"           *       *       *       *       *        Then those four excelling horses--nobly bred--of courage high,      In their harness to the chariot--did the skilful Nala yoke.--      To the chariot yoked, as mounted--in his eager haste the king      To the earth those best of horses--bowed their knees and stooped them down.      Then the noblest of all heroes--Nala, with a soothing voice,      Spake unto those horses, gifted--both with fleetness and with strength.      Up the reins when he had gathered--he the charioteer bade mount,      First, Varshneya, skilled in driving--at full speed then set he forth.        Urged by Vahuca, those coursers--to the utmost of their speed,      All at once in th' air sprung upward--as the driver to unseat.      Then, as he beheld those horses--bearing him as fleet as wind,      Did the monarch of Ayodhya--in his silent wonder sit.      When the rattling of the chariot--when the guiding of the reins,      When of Vahuca the science--saw he, thus Varshneya thought:      \"Is it Matali,[121] the chariot--of the king of heaven that drives?      Lo, in Vahuca each virtue--of that godlike charioteer!      Is it Salihotra skilful--in the race, the strength of steeds,      That hath ta'en a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19549"],[0,"The Mind of the Child, Part II (#11)"],[1,"to lack of intelligence. When the child  of a year and a half offers leaves to a sheep or a stag, observes the  strange animal with somewhat timid astonishment, and a few days after  holds out some hastily plucked grass-blades to a chaffinch he sees  hopping across the road, supposing that the bird will likewise take them  from his hand and eat them--an observation that I made on my child  exactly as Sigismund did on his--it is not right to call such an act  \"stupid\"; the act shows ignorance--i. e., inexperience--but it is not  illogical. The child would be properly called stupid only in case he did  not _learn_ the difference between the animals fed. When, on the other  hand, the child of two and a half years, entirely of his own accord,  holds a watch first to his left ear, then to his right, listens both  times, and then says, \"The watch goes, goes too!\" then, pointing with  his finger to a clock, cries with delight, \"The clock goes too,\" we  rightly find in such independent induction a proof of intellect. For the  swinging of the pendulum and the ticking had indeed often been  perceived, but to connect the notion of a \"going clock\" with the visible  but noiseless swinging, just as with the audible but invisible ticking  of the watch, requires a pretty well advanced power of abstraction.    That the ability to _abstract_ may show itself, though imperfectly, even  in the first year, is, according to my observations, certain. Infants  are struck by a quality of an object--e. g., the white appearance of  milk. The \"taking away\" or \"abstracting\" then consists in the isolating  of this quality out of innumerable other sight-impressions and the  blending of the impressions into a concept. The _naming_ of this, which  begins months later, by a rudimental word, like _mum_, is an outward  sign of this abstraction, which did not at all lead to the formation of  the concept, but followed it, as will be shown in detail further on (in  the two following chapters).    It would be interesting to collect observations concerning this  reasoning power in the very earliest period, because at that time  language does not interfere to help or to hinder. But it is just such  observations that we especially lack. When a child in the twelfth month,  on hearing a watch for the first time, cries out, \"Tick-tick,\" looking  meantime at the clock on the wall, he has not, in doing this, \"formed,\"  as G. Lindner supposes, \"his first concept, although a vague and empty  one as yet,\" but he had the concept before, and has now merely given a  name to it for the first time.    The first observation made in regard to his child by Darwin, which  seemed to him to prove \"a sort of practical reflection,\" occurred on the  one hundred and forty-fourth day. The child grasped his father's finger  and drew it to his mouth, but his own hand prevented him from sucking  the finger. The child then, strangely enough, instead of entirely  withdrawing his hand, slipped it along the finger so that he could get  the end of the finger into his mouth. This proceeding was several times  repeated, and was evidently not accidental but intentional. At the age  of five months, associations of ideas arose independently of all  instruction. Thus, e. g., the child, being dressed in hat and cloak, was  very angry if he was not at once taken out of doors.    How strong the _reasoning power without_ words may be at a later period,  the following additional observations show:    From the time when my child, like Sigismund's (both in the fifteenth  month), had burned his finger in the flame of the candle, he could not  be induced to put his finger near the flame again, but he would  sometimes put it in fun toward the flame without touching it, and he  even (eighteen months old) carried a stick of wood of his own accord to  the stove-door and pushed it in through the open slide, with a proud  look at his parents. There is surely something more than an imitation  here.    Further, my child at first never used to let his mouth and chin be wiped  without crying; from the fifteenth month on he kept perfectly quiet  during the disagreeable operation. He must have noticed that this was  finished sooner when he was quiet.    The same thing can be observed in every little child, provided he is not  too much talked to, punished, yielded to, or spoiled. In the nineteenth  month it happened with my child that he resisted the command to lie down  in the evening. I let him cry, and raise himself on his bed, but did not  take him up, did not speak to him, did not use any force, but remained  motionless and watchful near by. At last he became tired, lay down, and  fell asleep directly. Here he acquired an understanding of the  uselessness of crying in order to avoid obedience to commands.    The _knowledge_ of right (what is allowed and commanded) and of wrong  (what is forbidden) had been long since acquired. In the seventeenth  month, e. g., a sense of cleanliness was strongly developed, and later  (in the thirty-third month) the child could not, without lively protest,  behold his nurse acting contrary to the directions that had been given  to himself--e. g., putting the knife into her mouth or dipping bread  into the milk. Emotions of this kind are less a proof of the existence  of a sense of duty than of the _understanding_ that violations of  well-known precepts have unpleasant consequences--i. e., that certain  actions bring in their train pleasant feelings, while other acts bring  unpleasant feelings. How long before the knowledge of words these  emotions began to exist I have, unfortunately, not succeeded in  determining.    But in many of the above cases--and they might without difficulty be  multiplied by diligent observation--there is not the least indication of  any influence of spoken words. Whether no attempt at speaking has  preceded, or whether a small collection of words may have been made, the  cases of child-intelligence adduced in this chapter, observed by myself,  prove that without knowledge of verbal language, and independently of  it, the logical activity of the child attains a high degree of  development, and no reason exists for explaining the intelligent actions  of children who do not yet speak at all--i. e., do not yet clothe their  ideas in words, but do already combine them with one another--as being  different specifically from the intelligent (not instinctive) actions of  sagacious orangs and chimpanzees. The difference consists far more in  this, that the latter can not form so many, so clear, and so abstract  conceptions, or so many and complicated combinations of ideas, as can  the gifted human child in the society of human beings--_even before he  has learned to speak_. When he has learned to speak, then the gap widens  to such an extent that what before was in some respects almost the  equal of humanity seems now a repulsive caricature of it.    In order, then, to understand the real difference between brute and man,  it is necessary to ascertain how a child and a brute animal may have  ideas without words, and may combine them for an end: whether it is  done, e. g., with memory-images, as in dreaming. And it is necessary  also to investigate the _essential character of the process of learning  to speak_.    Concerning the first problem, which is of uncommon psychogenetic  interest and practical importance, a solution seems to be promised in  the investigation of the formation of concepts in the case of those born  deaf, the so-called deaf and dumb children. On this point I offer first  the words of a man of practical experience.    The excellent superintendent of the Educational Institute for the Deaf  and Dumb in Weimar, C. Oehlwein (1867), well says:    \"The deaf-mute in his first years of life looks at, turns over, feels of  objects that attract him, on all sides, and approaches those that are at  a distance. By this he receives, like the young child who has all his  senses, sensations and sensuous ideas;[C] and from the objects  themselves he apprehends a number of qualities, which he compares with  one another or with the qualities of other objects, but always refers to  the object which at the time attracts him. Herein he has a more correct  or less correct sense-intuition of this object, according as he has  observed, compared, and comprehended more or less attentively. As this  object has affected him through sight and feeling, so he represents it  to other persons also by characteristic signs for sight and indirectly  for feeling also. He shapes or draws a copy of the object seen and felt  with life and movement. For this he avails himself of the means that  Nature has placed directly within human power--the control over the  movement of the facial muscles, over the use of the hands, and, if  necessary, of the feet also. These signs, _not obtained from any one's  suggestion_, self-formed, which the deaf-mute employs directly in his  representation, are, as it were, the given outline of the image which he  has found, and they stand therefore in the closest relation to the inner  constitution of the individual that makes the representation.    \"But we find not only that the individual senses of the deaf-mute, his  own observation and apprehension, are formative factors in the  occurrences of sensation and perception, as is of course the case, but  that the qualities of the objects observed by him, and associated,  according to his individual tendencies, are also raised by him, through  comparison, separation, grouping--through his own act, therefore--to  general ideas, concepts, although as yet imperfect ones, and they are  named and recognized again by peculiar signs intelligible to himself.    \"But in this very raising of an idea to a general idea, to a concept--a  process connected with the forming of a sign--is manifested the  influence of the lack of hearing and of speech upon the psychical  development of the deaf-mute.
