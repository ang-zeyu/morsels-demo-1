Upon the cry of thieves  being raised, the delinquents took to their heels, leaving their leader a  prisoner.  The next day, being brought before the king's justiciar, he  informed against his companions. This cowardly action on the part of  Bucquinte led to many of them being taken, and among them one who is  described by the chronicler as the noblest and wealthiest of London  citizens, but to whom the chronicler gives no other name than \"John, the  old man\" (_Johannes Senex_). An offer was made to John to prove his  innocence by what was known as the ordeal by water,(142) but the offer was  declined, and he was eventually hanged. The whole story looks suspicious.    (M99)    Having settled the succession of the crown of England upon his eldest son,  the king put his second son, Richard, into possession of the Duchy of  Aquitaine, and provided for his third son, Geoffrey, by marriage with the  heiress of Brittany. There was yet another son, John, who was too young to  be provided for just now, and who being without any territory, assigned to  him, acquired the name of Lackland. Both Richard and Geoffrey had taken  the part of their brother Henry in 1173, and in 1177 the three brothers  were again quarrelling with their father and with each other. After the  deaths of Henry and Geoffrey, the quarrel was taken up by the surviving  brothers, Richard and John.    In all these--more or less--petty wars with his sons, the king had always to  deal with the ruler of France. At last, in 1189, the loss of Le Mans--his  own birth-place--and the unexpected discovery that his youngest and best  beloved son, John, had turned traitor towards him, left the king nothing  to live for, and after a few days suffering he died, ill and worn out, at  Chinon.    (M100)    Richard had scarcely succeeded to the throne, before he set out on a  crusade, leaving the government of his country in the hands of William  Longchamp, Bishop of Ely, as chancellor.(143) With him was associated in  the government, Hugh de Puiset, or Pudsey, Bishop of Durham, but Longchamp  soon got the supreme control of affairs into his own hands, and commenced  to act in the most tyrannical fashion. He increased the security of the  Tower of London, which had been committed to his charge, by surrounding it  with a moat,(144) and having got himself nominated papal legate, made a  progress through the country committing the greatest extortion.(145)    (M101) (M102)    Report of the Chancellor's conduct having reached the ears of Richard, he  despatched the Archbishop of Rouen to England with a new commission, but  the worthy prelate on arrival (April, 1191), was afraid to present the  commission, preferring to let matters take their course.(146) Already a  fierce rivalry had sprung up between the chancellor and John, the king's  brother, who, for purposes of his own, had espoused the cause of the  oppressed. Popular feeling at length became so strong, that Longchamp  feared to meet John and the bishops, and, instead of going to Reading,  where his attendance was required, he hastened to London. Arriving there  (7 Oct.), he called the citizens together in the Guildhall, and prayed  them to uphold the King against John, whom he denounced as aiming plainly  at the Crown. The leading men in the city at the time were Richard  Fitz-Reiner and Henry de Cornhill. These took opposite sides, the former  favouring John, whilst the latter took the side of the chancellor.(147)  John's party proving the stronger of the two, Longchamp thought it safest  to seek refuge in the Tower.(148)    (M103)    As soon as John found that the chancellor had gone to London instead of  Reading, he too hastened thither. On his arrival he was welcomed and  hospitably entertained by Richard Fitz-Reiner who gave him to understand  on what terms he might expect the support of the city.(149) As to terms,  John was ready to accede to any that might be proposed.    (M104) (M105)    The next day (8 Oct.), a meeting of the barons of the realm, as well as of  the citizens of London, was convened in St. Paul's Church, to consider the  conduct of the chancellor, and it was thereupon decided that Longchamp  should be deposed from office. The story, as told by different  chroniclers,(150) varies in some particulars, but the main features are  the same in all. The king's minister was set aside, John was recognised as  the head of the kingdom, and new appointments made to judicial, fiscal,  and military offices. The Archbishop of Rouen, who attended the council,  seeing the turn affairs had taken, no longer hesitated to produce the  letters under the king's sign manual appointing a new commission for the  government of the kingdom.    (M106)    The same day that witnessed the fall of Longchamp was also a memorable one  in the annals of the City of London; for immediately after judgment had  been passed on the chancellor, John and the assembled barons granted to  the citizens \"their commune,\" swearing to preserve untouched the dignities  of the city during the king's pleasure.  The citizens on their part swore  fealty to King Richard, and declared their readiness to accept John as  successor to the throne in the event of his brother dying childless.(151)    (M107)    This is the first public recognition of the citizens of London as a body  corporate; but so far from granting to them something new, the very words  _their_ commune (_communam suam_) imply a commune of which they were _de  facto_, if not _de jure_ already in enjoyment. How long the commune may  have been in existence, unauthorised by the crown, cannot be determined;  but that the term _communio_ in connection with the city's organization  was known half a century before, we have already seen;(152) and, according  to the opinion of Giraldus Cambrensis, there is no valid distinction  between the words _communio_, _communa_ and _communia_.(153) Bishop  Stubbs, however, hesitates to translate _communio_ as \"commune,\" the  latter being essentially a French term for a particular form of municipal  government. He prefers to render it \"commonalty,\" \"fraternity,\" or  \"franchise,\" although he goes so far as to allow that the term \"suggests  that the communal idea was already in existence as a basis of civic  organization\" in Stephen's reign, an idea which became fully developed in  the succeeding reign.(154) He is also in favour of dating the foundation  of the _communa_ in London from this grant by John and the barons,(155)  and in this view he is supported by Richard of Devizes, who distinctly  states that the _communia_ of London was instituted on that occasion, and  that it was of such a character that neither King Richard nor Henry his  father would have conceded it for a million marks of silver, and that a  _communia_ was in fact everything that was bad. It puffed up the people,  it threatened the kingdom, and it emasculated the priesthood.(156)    (M108)    With the change from a shire organization to that of a French _commune_,  whenever that happened to take place, there took place also a change in  the chief governor of the city. The head of the city was no longer a Saxon  \"port-reeve\" but a French \"mayor,\" the former officer continuing in all  probability to perform the duties of a port-reeve or sheriff of a town in  a modified form. From the time when this \"civic revolution\"(157) occurred,  down to the present day, the sheriff's position has always been one of  secondary importance, being himself subordinate to the mayor.    (M109)    The earliest mention of a mayor of London in a formal document is said to  occur in a writ of the reign of Henry II.(158) The popular opinion,  however, is that a change in the name of the chief magistrate of the City  of London took place at the accession of Richard I. What gave rise to this  belief is hard to say, but it is not improbable that it arose from a  statement to be found in an early manuscript record still preserved among  the archives of the Corporation, and known as the _Liber de Antiquis  Legibus_.(159) The original portion of this manuscript purports to be a  chronicle of mayors and sheriffs from 1188 down to 1273, noticing briefly  the chief events in each year, and referring to a few particulars relative  to the year 1274.    After naming the sheriffs who were appointed at Michaelmas, A.D. 1188,  \"the first year of the reign of King Richard,\"(160) it goes on to say that  \"in the same year Henry Fitz-Eylwin of Londenestane was made mayor of  London, who was the first mayor of the city, and continued to be such  mayor to the end of his life, that is to say, for nearly five and twenty  years.\" That Henry Fitz-Eylwin was mayor in the first year of Richard's  reign is stated no less than three times in the chronicle.(161)    (M110)    The compiler of the chronicle is supposed to have been Arnald or Arnulf  Fitz-Thedmar,(162) an Alderman of London, although it is not known over  which ward he presided. Particulars of his life are given in the volume  itself, from which we gather that he was a grandson on the mother's side  of Arnald de Grevingge(163) a citizen of Cologne; that his father's name  was Thedmar, a native of Bremen; that he was born on the vigil of St.  Lawrence [10 August] A.D. 1201, his mother being forewarned of the  circumstances that would attend his birth in a manner familiar to biblical  readers; that he was deprived of his aldermanry by the king, but was  afterwards restored; that he became supporter of the king against Simon de  Montfort and the barons, and that he was among those whom Thomas  Fitz-Thomas, the leader of the democratic party and his followers, had  \"intended to slay\" on the very day that news reached London of the battle  of Evesham, which crushed the hopes of Montfort and his supporters. The  date of his death cannot be precisely determined, but there can be but  little doubt that it took"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19826"],[0,"The White Christmas and other Merry Christmas Plays (#11)"],[1,"ob, Hans and Mieze.  Wreath of holly for Neelda.  Small wooden shoes for Tomasso.  Tinsel star for Hulda.  Telescope for Jack Frost. Made from a pasteboard roll covered with    black cloth.  Toy air ship on a wire, to sail across stage at rear.  Pack of toys for Santa Claus.  Sleigh bells for Santa.  Chimes heard outside.      COSTUMES AND SUGGESTIONS.    SANTA CLAUS--High boots. Red or brown coat or mackinaw, trimmed with  fur (or cotton, dotted to imitate ermine fur). Cap to match coat.  String of bells around neck. Pack of toys. White hair, mustache and  long, white beard. Rosy cheeks. Do not wear a false-face, as this  often frightens little children and makes the character seem unreal.  When there are little children in the cast, their belief in Santa  Claus must not be disturbed and the adult portraying the character  need not attend the general rehearsals. The high boots may be shaped  from black oil-cloth and drawn on over black shoes. Use a pillow or  two to give an ample girth.    JOLLY JACK FROST (aged 8 or 9)--A jolly, little chubby-faced boy who  can memorize and deliver a long part. White stockings and shoes.  Canton flannel suit of white, trimmed with long points cut from cloth,  to represent icicles. Long-pointed cap of white, coming down around  back of head and forming a long-pointed collar in front. The top point  should be wired into position. Face and hands are powdered very white.  Put small dabs of mucilage on the costume and sprinkle here and there  with diamond dust powder. Trim the costume with bits of cotton to  represent snow.    ANITA (aged 8 or 9)--Dark hair and complexion. Black slippers with red  rosettes or bows on them. White stockings. Green skirt. Small dark red  apron, edged with white, black and green. Black spencer waist laced in  front showing the white underwaist. Puffed sleeves falling to elbows.  Green and red bows on elbows. Red silk handkerchief laid loosely over  the shoulders. Gold beads around neck. Large earrings may be attached  with court plaster. The headdress is a white oblong cloth, about six  inches wide and about eighteen inches long. This cloth is gayly  decorated with bands of red, green and black ribbons and the part on  the head is padded with a small square of pasteboard. Tambourine  decorated with red, black and green ribbons. A yellow silk  handkerchief may replace the Sicilian headdress above described.    HULDA (aged 10)--A blonde girl with hair in two long braids. Wooden  shoes, white stockings. Several very full underskirts. Long skirt of  dark blue, made very full around the bottom. This skirt is patched  with squares of dark red and striped goods. Large blue gingham apron  edged with stripes of dark red. White waist. Blue bodice of same  material as skirt. Small white cap fitting close to head in back, but  turned back in front with points over each ear. Face round and rosy.  If the wooden shoes are not easily obtained, fair substitutes may be  made by covering an old pair of shoes with cream colored oil-cloth.    SERGIUS (aged 9)--Black oil-cloth leggings to knees. Dark trousers.  Long Russian blouse of dark green coming nearly to knees and belted in  at waist with black oil-cloth belt. Blouse edged with dark fur. Dark  green cap trimmed with dark fur.    MEENY (aged 7)--Full white waist. Black bodice laced with red. Rather  short red skirt, with black stripes sewed around bottom. White lace  apron edged with red and black. White mob cap, puffed high in front.  Red and black strings on cap which are tied under her chin. She  carries a gray woolen sock, half finished, and knitting needles.  Wooden shoes if possible.

Shoes, old and  worn, and many, many sizes too large for him.    TOMASSO--Black slippers, white stockings. Red and yellow ribbons wound  around legs. Black knee breeches and zouave jacket. Striped sport  shirt. Red and yellow bows at knees and on shoulders. Red handkerchief  knotted loosely at throat. Black felt hat, turned up side, gayly  decorated with red and yellow ribbons. On his second entrance he  carries a violin. A dark complexioned boy aged about 9.    THE DUTCH TWINS (aged 4 or 5)--Hair in Buster Brown style. Very full  blue trousers extending from under the arms to ankles. These are made  of blue denim and patched with large vari-colored patches. Wooden  shoes. Striped shirts. Dutch caps made of dark cloth, with a peak in  front and a crown about six inches high. The twins should be dressed  exactly alike and look as much alike as possible. Get chubby little  fellows and thoroughly rehearse them in their part; in fact they must  go over it so much that it must come as second nature to them on the  night of the performance. Much of the humor in the play depends on the  little Dutch twins. When they walk let them take long striding steps.  Use frequent gestures, nods, etc., in their dialogue, but be sure and  have every movement exactly the same at each rehearsal. These parts  are not difficult if the little actors are well trained, and their  success on the night of the performance will amply repay the trouble  spent in their proper coaching.    NEELDA--A little brunette girl, aged 4 or 5. Yellow sateen skirt and  zouave jacket, trimmed with coarse black lace. Broad red sash tied on  the side. White baby waist.

Tall black cap similar to those worn by the twins.    MIEZE--Little girl of 3 or 4, dressed similar to Hulda, but in dark  red and red and white checked gingham.    SANO SAN--Little Japanese girl in kimono and sash. Eyebrows slanting.  Hair dressed high. Chrysanthemums over ears. Carries a paper parasol  or fan.    The Christmas tree is for the whole school and is concealed during the  first part of the play by curtains. If there is to be no tree, all  reference to it may be omitted without injury to the continuity of the  play.    Other songs may be substituted for the songs here given, but these  have proved very successful in several performances of Anita's  Secret.

Sure, there isn't much argument at all, at all. It's all happiness and  merriment and love, and where there is happiness and merriment and  love there isn't any time for argument. The Widow Mulligan is a  cheerful washerwoman who lives in Mulligan Alley in Shantytown,  surrounded by her ten little Mulligans, to say nothing of the goat,  Shamus O'Brien. A good-hearted neighbor, Mrs. O'Toole, has a lively  time with the goat, but she forgives all his misdeeds as it is  Christmas Eve and the little Mulligans are starting out for a grand  Christmas entertainment. When they return they entertain their mother  and Mrs. O'Toole, and, incidentally, the audience.    But let's have done with the argument and let the fun begin.           *       *       *       *       *    ACT I.    SCENE: _The Mulligan's front room. Entrances at right and left. Window  at rear.
