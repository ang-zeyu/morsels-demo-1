The claim, afterward  advanced by Mr. Douglas and others, that this declaration was intended  to assert the right of the first settlers of a Territory, in its  inchoate, rudimental, dependent, and transitional condition, to  determine the character of its institutions, constituted the doctrine  popularly known as \"squatter sovereignty.\" Its assertion led to the  dissensions which ultimately resulted in a rupture of the Democratic  party.    Sectional rivalry, the deadly foe of the \"domestic tranquillity\" and the  \"general welfare,\" which the compact of union was formed to insure, now  interfered, with gigantic efforts, to prevent that free migration which  had been promised, and to hinder the decision by climate and the  interests of the inhabitants of the institutions to be established by  these embryo States. Societies were formed in the North to supply money  and send emigrants into the new Territories; and a famous preacher,  addressing a body of those emigrants, charged them to carry with them to  Kansas \"the Bible and Sharpe's rifles.\" The latter were of course to be  leveled against the bosoms of their Southern brethren who might migrate  to the same Territory, but the use to be made of the Bible in the same  fraternal enterprise was left unexplained by the reverend gentleman.    The war-cry employed to train the Northern mind for the deeds  contemplated by the agitators was \"No extension of slavery!\" Was this  sentiment real or feigned? The number of slaves (as has already been  clearly shown) would not have been increased by their transportation to  new territory. It could not be augmented by further importation, for the  law of the land made that piracy. Southern men were the leading authors  of that enactment, and the public opinion of their descendants, stronger  than the law, fully sustained it. The climate of Kansas and Nebraska was  altogether unsuited to the negro, and the soil was not adapted to those  productions for which negro labor could be profitably employed. If,  then, any negroes held to service or labor, as provided in the compact  of union, had been transported to those Territories, they would have  been such as were bound by personal attachment mutually existing between  master and servant, which would have rendered it impossible for the  former to consider the latter as property convertible into money. As  white laborers, adapted to the climate and its products, flowed into the  country, negro labor would have inevitably become a tax to those who  held it, and their emancipation would have followed that condition, as  it has in all the Northern States, old or new--Wisconsin furnishing the  last example.[12] It may, therefore, be reasonably concluded that the  \"war-cry\" was employed by the artful to inflame the minds of the less  informed and less discerning; that it was adopted in utter disregard of  the means by which negro emancipation might have been peaceably  accomplished in the Territories, and with the sole object of obtaining  sectional control and personal promotion by means of popular agitation.    The success attending this artifice was remarkable. To such an extent  was it made available, that Northern indignation was aroused on the  absurd accusation that the South had destroyed \"that sacred instrument,  the compromise of 1820.\" The internecine war which raged in Kansas for  several years was substituted for the promised peace under the operation  of the natural laws regulating migration to new countries. For the  fratricide which dyed the virgin soil of Kansas with the blood of those  who should have stood shoulder to shoulder in subduing the wilderness;  for the frauds which corrupted the ballot-box and made the name of  election a misnomer--let the authors of \"squatter sovereignty\" and the  fomenters of sectional hatred answer to the posterity for whose peace  and happiness the fathers formed the Federal compact.    In these scenes of strife were trained the incendiaries who afterward  invaded Virginia under the leadership of John Brown; and at this time  germinated the sentiments which led men of high position to sustain,  with their influence and their money, this murderous incursion into the  South.[13]    Now was seen the lightning of that storm, the distant muttering of which  had been heard so long, and against which the wise and the patriotic had  given solemn warning, regarding it as the sign which portended a  dissolution of the Union.    Diversity of interests and of opinions among the States of the  Confederation had in the beginning presented great difficulties in the  way of the formation of a more perfect union. The compact was the result  of compromise between the States, at that time generally distinguished  as navigating and agricultural, afterward as Northern and Southern. When  the first census was taken, in 1790, there was but little numerical  difference in the population of these two sections, and (including  States about to be admitted) there was also an exact equality in the  number of States. Each section had, therefore, the power of  self-protection, and might feel secure against any danger of Federal  aggression. If the disturbance of that equilibrium had been the  consequence of natural causes, and the government of the whole had  continued to be administered strictly for the general welfare, there  would have been no ground for complaint of the result.    Under the old Confederation the Southern States had a large excess of  territory. The acquisition of Louisiana, of Florida, and of Texas,  afterward greatly increased this excess. The generosity and patriotism  of Virginia led her, before the adoption of the Constitution, to cede  the Northwest Territory to the United States. The \"Missouri Compromise\"  surrendered to the North all the newly acquired region not included in  the State of Missouri, and north of the parallel of thirty-six degrees  and a half. The northern part of Texas was in like manner given up by  the compromise of 1850; and the North, having obtained, by those  successive cessions, a majority in both Houses of Congress, took to  itself all the territory acquired from Mexico. Thus, by the action of  the General Government, the means were provided permanently to destroy  the original equilibrium between the sections.    Nor was this the only injury to which the South was subjected. Under the  power of Congress to levy duties on imports, tariff laws were enacted,  not merely \"to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and  general welfare of the United States,\" as authorized by the  Constitution, but, positively and primarily, for the protection against  foreign competition of domestic manufactures. The effect of this was to  impose the main burden of taxation upon the Southern people, who were  consumers and not manufacturers, not only by the enhanced price of  imports, but indirectly by the consequent depreciation in the value of  exports, which were chiefly the products of Southern States. The  imposition of this grievance was unaccompanied by the consolation of  knowing that the tax thus borne was to be paid into the public Treasury,  for the increase of price accrued mainly to the benefit of the  manufacturer. Nor was this all: a reference to the annual appropriations  will show that the disbursements made were as unequal as the burdens  borne--the inequality in both operating in the same direction.    These causes all combined to direct immigration to the Northern section;  and with the increase of its preponderance appeared more and more  distinctly a tendency in the Federal Government to pervert functions  delegated to it, and to use them with sectional discrimination against  the minority.    The resistance to the admission of Missouri as a State, in 1820, was  evidently not owing to any moral or constitutional considerations, but  merely to political motives; and the compensation exacted for granting  what was simply a right, was the exclusion of the South from equality in  the enjoyment of territory which justly belonged equally to both, and  which was what the enemies of the South stigmatized as \"slave  territory,\" when acquired.    The sectional policy then indicated brought to its support the passions  that spring from man's higher nature, but which, like all passions, if  misdirected and perverted, become hurtful and, it may be, destructive.  The year 1835 was marked by the public agitation for the abolition of  that African servitude which existed in the South, which antedated the  Union, and had existed in every one of the States that formed the  Confederation.

An attempt to murder the  energetic prime minister resulted in the death of his colleague, Beltcheff,  and shortly afterwards Dr Vlkovitch, the Bulgarian representative at  Constantinople, was assassinated. While contending with unscrupulous  enemies at home, Stamboloff pursued a successful policy abroad. Excellent  relations were established with Turkey and Rumania, valuable concessions  were twice extracted from the Porte in regard to the Bulgarian episcopate  in Macedonia, and loans were concluded with foreign financiers on  comparatively favourable terms. His overbearing character, however,  increased the number of his opponents, and alienated the goodwill of the  prince.    In the spring of 1893 Prince Ferdinand married Princess Marie-Louise of  Bourbon-Parma, whose family insisted on the condition that the issue of the  marriage should be brought up in the Roman Catholic faith. In view of the  importance of establishing a dynasty, Stamboloff resolved on the unpopular  course of altering the clause of the constitution which required that the  heir to the throne should belong to the Orthodox Church, and the Grand  Sobranye, which was convoked at Trnovo in the summer, gave effect to this  decision. The death of Prince Alexander, which took place in the autumn,  and the birth of an heir, tended to strengthen the position of Prince  Ferdinand, who now assumed a less compliant attitude towards the prime  minister. In 1894 Stamboloff resigned office; a ministry was formed under  Dr Stoiloff, and Prince Ferdinand inaugurated a policy of conciliation  towards Russia with a view to obtaining his recognition by the powers. A  Russophil [v.04 p.0784] reaction followed, large numbers of political  refugees returned to Bulgaria, and Stamboloff, exposed to the vengeance of  his enemies, was assassinated in the streets of Sofia (15th July 1895).    The prince's plans were favoured by the death of the tsar Alexander III. in  November 1894, and the reconciliation was practically effected by the  conversion of his eldest son, Prince Boris, to the Orthodox faith (14th  February 1896). The powers having signified their assent, he was nominated  by the sultan prince of Bulgaria and governor-general of Eastern Rumelia  (14th March). Russian influence now became predominant in Bulgaria, but the  cabinet of St Petersburg wisely abstained from interfering in the internal  affairs of the principality. In February 1896 Russia proposed the  reconciliation of the Greek and Bulgarian churches and the removal of the  exarch to Sofia. The project, which involved a renunciation of the exarch's  jurisdiction in Macedonia, excited strong opposition in Bulgaria, and was  eventually dropped. The death of Princess Marie-Louise (30th January 1899),  caused universal regret in the country. In the same month the Stoiloff  government, which had weakly tampered with the Macedonian movement (see  MACEDONIA) and had thrown the finances into disorder, resigned, and a  ministry under Grekoff succeeded, which endeavoured to mend the economic  situation by means of a foreign loan. The loan, however, fell through, and  in October a new government was formed under Ivanchoff and Radoslavoff.  This, in its turn, was replaced by a _cabinet d'affaires_ under General  Petroff (January 1901).    In the following March Karaveloff for the third time became prime minister.  His efforts to improve the financial situation, which now became alarming,  proved abortive, and in January 1902 a Tzankovist cabinet was formed under  Daneff, who succeeded in obtaining a foreign loan. Russian influence now  became predominant, and in the autumn the grand-duke Nicholas, General  Ignatiev, and a great number of Russian officers were present at the  consecration of a Russian church and monastery in the Shipka pass. But the  appointment of Mgr. Firmilian, a Servian prelate, to the important see of  Uskub at the instance of Russia, the suspected designs of that power on the  ports of Varna and Burgas, and her unsympathetic attitude in regard to the  Macedonian Question, tended to diminish her popularity and that of the  government. A cabinet crisis was brought about in May 1903, by the efforts  of the Russian party to obtain control of the army, and the Stambolovists  returned to power under General Petroff. A violent recrudescence of the  Macedonian agitation took place in the autumn of 1902; at the suggestion of  Russia the leaders were imprisoned, but the movement nevertheless gained  force, and in August 1903 a revolt broke out in the vilayet of Monastir,  subsequently spreading to the districts of northern Macedonia and  Adrianople (see MACEDONIA). The barbarities committed by the Turks in  repressing the insurrection caused great exasperation in the principality;  the reserves were partially mobilized, and the country was brought to the  brink of war. In pursuance of the policy of Stamboloff, the Petroff  government endeavoured to inaugurate friendly relations with Turkey, and a  Turco-Bulgarian convention was signed (8th April 1904) which, however,  proved of little practical value.    The outrages committed by numerous Greek bands in Macedonia led to  reprisals on the Greek population in Bulgaria in the summer of 1906, and  the town of Anchialo was partially destroyed. On the 6th of November in  that year Petroff resigned, and Petkoff, the leader of the Stambolovist  party, formed a ministry. The prime minister, a statesman of undoubted  patriotism but of overbearing character, was assassinated on the 11th of  March 1907 by a youth who had been dismissed from a post in one of the  agricultural banks, and the cabinet was reconstituted under Gudeff, a  member of the same party.    _Declaration of Independence._--During the thirty years of its existence  the principality had made rapid and striking progress. Its inhabitants,  among whom a strong sense of nationality had grown up, were naturally  anxious to escape from the restrictions imposed by the treaty of Berlin.  That Servia should be an independent state, while Bulgaria, with its  greater economic and military resources, remained tributary to the Sultan,  was an anomaly which all classes resented; and although the Ottoman  suzerainty was little more than a constitutional fiction, and the tribute  imposed in 1878 was never paid, the Bulgarians were almost unanimous in  their desire to end a system which made their country the vassal of a  Moslem state notorious for its maladministration and corruption. This  desire was strengthened by the favourable reception accorded to Prince  Ferdinand when he visited Vienna in February 1908, and by the so-called  \"Geshoff incident,\" _i.e._ the exclusion of M. Geshoff, the Bulgarian  agent, from a dinner given by Tewfik Pasha, the Ottoman minister for  foreign affairs, to the ministers of all the sovereign states represented  at Constantinople (12th of September 1908). This was interpreted as an  insult to the Bulgarian nation, and as the explanation offered by the grand  vizier was unsatisfactory, M. Geshoff was recalled to Sofia. At this time  the bloodless revolution in Turkey seemed likely to bring about a  fundamental change in the settled policy of Bulgaria. For many years past  Bulgarians had hoped that their own orderly and progressive government,  which had contrasted so strongly with the evils of Turkish rule, would  entitle them to consideration, and perhaps to an accession of territory,  when the time arrived for a definite settlement of the Macedonian Question.  Now, however, the reforms introduced or foreshadowed by the Young Turkish  party threatened to deprive Bulgaria of any pretext for future  intervention; there was nothing to be gained by further acquiescence in the  conditions laid down at Berlin. An opportunity for effective action  occurred within a fortnight of M. Geshoff's recall, when a strike broke out  on those sections of the Eastern Rumelian railways which were owned by  Turkey and leased to the Oriental Railways Company. The Bulgarians alleged  that during the strike Turkish troops were able to travel on the lines  which were closed to all other traffic, and that this fact constituted a  danger to their own autonomy. The government therefore seized the railway,  in defiance of European opinion, and in spite of the protests of the  suzerain power and the Oriental Railways Company. The bulk of the Turkish  army was then in Asia, and the new regime was not yet firmly established,  while the Bulgarian government were probably aware that Russia would not  intervene, and that Austria-Hungary intended to annex Bosnia and  Herzegovina, and thus incidentally to divert attention from their own  violation of the treaty of Berlin. On the 5th of October Prince Ferdinand  publicly proclaimed Bulgaria, united since the 6th of September 1885  (_i.e._ including Eastern Rumelia), an independent kingdom. This  declaration was read aloud by the king in the church of the Forty Martyrs  at Trnovo, the ancient capital of the Bulgarian tsars. The Porte  immediately protested to the powers, but agreed to accept an indemnity. In  February 1909 the Russian government proposed to advance to Bulgaria the  difference between the L4,800,000 claimed by Turkey and the L1,520,000  which Bulgaria undertook to pay. A preliminary Russo-Turkish protocol was  signed on the 16th of March, and in April, after the final agreement had  been concluded, the independence of Bulgaria was recognized by the powers.  Of the indemnity, L1,680,000 was paid on account of the Eastern Rumelian  railways; the allocation of this sum between Turkey and the Oriental  railways was submitted to arbitration.
