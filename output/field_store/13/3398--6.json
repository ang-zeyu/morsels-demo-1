The Ataris observe the Hindu law of inheritance, and some of  them worship Hindu deities, as Mata the goddess of smallpox. As a rule  their women are not secluded. The Ataris make _missi_ or tooth-powder  from myrobalans, cloves and cardamoms, and other constituents. This  has the effect of blackening the teeth. They also sell the _kunku_  or red powder which women rub on their foreheads, its constituents  being turmeric, borax and the juice of limes. They sell scent and  sometimes deal in tobacco. The scents most in demand are _gulab-pani_  or rose-water and _phulel_ or essence of tilli or sesamum. Scents are  usually sold by the tola of 18 annas silver weight, [37] and a tola  of attar may vary in price from 8 annas to Rs. 80. Other scents are  made from _khas-khas_ grass, the mango, henna and musk, the _bela_  flower, [38] the champak [39] and cucumber. Scent is manufactured  by distillation from the flowers boiled in water, and the drops of  congealed vapour fall into sandalwood oil, which they say is the basis  of all scents. Fragrant oils are also sold for rubbing on the hair,  made from orange flowers, jasmine, cotton-seed and the flowers of  the _aonla_ tree. [40] Scent is sold in tiny circular glass bottles,  and the oils in little bottles made from thin leather. The Ataris  also retail the little black sticks of incense which are set up and  burnt at the time of taking food and in temples, so that the smell  and smoke may keep off evil spirits. When professional exorcists are  called upon to clear any building, such as a hospital, supposed to be  haunted by spirits or the ghosts of the dead, they commence operations  by placing these sticks of incense at the entrance and setting them  alight as in a temple.        Audhelia        1. Origin.      _Audhelia (Audhalia)._--A small hybrid caste found almost exclusively  in the Bilaspur District, where they number about 1000 persons. The  name is derived from the word Udharia, meaning a person with  clandestine sexual intimacies. The Audhelias are a mixed caste and  trace their origin from a Daharia Rajput ancestor, by one Bhuri Bandi,  a female slave of unknown caste. This couple is supposed to have  resided in Ratanpur, the old capital of Chhattisgarh, and the female  ancestors of the Audhelias are said to have been prostitutes until  they developed into a caste and began to marry among themselves. Their  proper avocation at present is the rearing of pigs, while some of  them are also tenants and farm-labourers. Owing to the base descent  and impure occupation of the caste they are held in very low esteem,  and their touch is considered to convey pollution.        2. Marriage.      The caste have at present no endogamous divisions and still admit  members of other castes with the exception of the very lowest. But  social gradations exist to a certain extent among the members  according to the position of their male ancestors, a Daharia Audhelia,  for instance, being reluctant to eat or intermarry with a Panka  Audhelia. Under these circumstances it has become a rule among the  Audhelias not to eat with their caste-fellows excepting their own  relations. On the occasion of a caste feast, therefore, each guest  prepares his own food, taking only uncooked grain from his host. At  present seven _gotras_ or exogamous divisions appear to have been  formed in the caste with the names of Pachbhaiya, Chhahri, Kalkhor,  Bachhawat, Dhanawat, Bhainsa and Limuan. The following story exists as  to the origin of these _gotras_: There were formerly three brothers,  Sahasman, Budha and Mangal, who were Sansis or robbers. One evening  the three brothers halted in a forest and went to look for food. One  brought back a buffalo-horn, another a peacock's feather and the  youngest, Mangal, brought plums. The other brothers asked Mangal to  let them share his plums, to which he agreed on condition that one  of the brothers should give his daughter to him in marriage. As  Mangal and his brothers were of one _gotra_ or section, and the  marriage would thus involve splitting up the _gotra_, the brothers  were doubtful whether it could be performed. They sought about for  some sign to determine this difficult question, and decided that if  Mangal succeeded in breaking in pieces an iron image of a cat simply  by blows of his naked fist, it would be a sufficient indication  that they might split up their _gotra_. Mangal was therefore put  to the ordeal and succeeded in breaking the image, so the three  brothers split up their _gotra_, the eldest assuming the _gotra_  name of Bhainsa because he had found a buffalo-horn, the second that  of Kalkhor, which is stated to mean peacock, and the third that of  Chhahri, which at any rate does not mean a plum. The word Chhahri  means either 'shadow,' or 'one who washes the clothes of a woman in  confinement.' If we assume it to have the latter meaning, it may be  due to the fact that Mangal had to wash the clothes of his own wife,  not being able to induce a professional washerman to do so on account  of the incestuous nature of the connection. As the eldest brother  gave his daughter in an incestuous marriage he was also degraded, and  became the ancestor of the Kanjars or prostitutes, who, it is said,  to the present day do not solicit Audhelias in consideration of the  consanguinity existing between them. The story itself sufficiently  indicates the low and mixed descent of the Audhelias, and its real  meaning may possibly be that when they first began to form a separate  caste they permitted incestuous marriages on account of the paucity of  their members. A curious point about the story is that the incestuous  nature of the connection is not taken to be the most pressing objection  to the marriage of Mangal with his own niece, but the violation of the  caste rule prohibiting marriage within the same _gotra_. Bachhawat  and Dhanawat are the names of sections of the Banjara caste, and  the persons of these _gotras_ among the Audhelias are probably  the descendants of illicit connections among Banjaras. The word  Pachbhaiya means 'five brothers,' and this name possibly commemorates a  polyandrous connection of some Audhelia woman. Limuan means a tortoise,  which is a section of many castes. Several of the section-names are  thus totemistic, and, as in other castes, some reverence is paid to  the animal from whom the name is derived. At present the Audhelias  forbid marriage within the same _gotra_ and also the union of first  cousins. Girls are married between five and seven years of age as their  numbers are scarce, and they are engaged as early as possible. Unless  weddings are arranged by exchanging girls between two families, a  high bride-price, often amounting to as much as Rs. 60, is paid. No  stigma is incurred, however, if a girl should remain unmarried till  she arrives at adolescence, but, on the contrary, a higher price is  then obtained for her. Sexual licence either before or after marriage  is considered a venial offence, but a woman detected in a _liaison_  with a man of one of the lowest castes is turned out of caste. Widow  marriage and divorce are freely allowed.        3. Religion, birth and death.      The Audhelias venerate Dulha Deo and Devi, to whom they usually offer  pigs. Their principal festival is the Holi, at which their women were  formerly engaged to perform as professional dancers. They usually burn  their dead and remove the ashes on the third day, throwing them into  the nearest stream. A few of the bones are picked up and buried under  a pipal tree, and a pitcher with a hole in the bottom is hung on the  tree so that water may trickle down on to them. On the tenth day the  caste-people assemble and are shaved and bathe and rub their bodies  with oil under the tree. Unmarried men and persons dying of cholera  are buried, the head being placed to the north. They consider that if  they place the corpse in the reverse position it would be an insult  to the Ganges equivalent to kicking the holy river, as the feet of  the body would then be turned towards it.

This appointment of Matilda was made by Henry in  consequence of the calamity which occurred just before Christmas, in  1120, when he lost his much-loved son, Prince William--the only male  legitimate issue of Henry--through the wreck of _La Blanche Nef_ (the  White Ship). On board the vessel were Prince William, his half-brother  Richard, and Henry's natural daughter the Countess of Perche, as well  as about a hundred and forty young noblemen of the most distinguished  families in England and Normandy, all of whom were lost in their  passage home, only a few hours after the safe arrival of the king in  England. Henry is said to have swooned at the intelligence, and was  never afterwards seen to smile. He had returned home anticipating a  joyous Christmas festival, a season of glad tidings, but he was  closely followed by this sad news of the death of the heir apparent.  The incident has called forth one of the most beautiful poems of Mrs.  Hemans, from which we quote two verses:--     \"The bark that held a prince went down,      The sweeping waves rolled on;    And what was England's glorious crown      To him that wept a son?    He lived--for life may long be borne,      Ere sorrow break its chain:    Why comes not death to those who mourn?      He never smiled again!      *     *     *     *     *      He sat where festal bowls went round,      He heard the minstrel sing;    He saw the tourney's victor crowned,      Amidst the kingly ring;    A murmur of the restless deep      Was blent with every strain,    A voice of winds that would not sleep,--      He never smiled again!\"    In 1127 Henry invited the king of the Scots to Windsor to join in the  royal celebration of Christmas, but the festivities were marred by an  unseemly quarrel between the two primates. Thurstan, Archbishop of  York, encroaching upon the privileges of his brother of Canterbury  (William de Corbeuil), insisted upon placing the crown upon the king's  head ere he set out for church. This the partisans of Canterbury would  not allow, settling the matter by turning Thurstan's chaplain and  followers out of doors, and thereby causing such strife between the  heads of the Church that they both set off to Rome to lay their  grievances before the Pope. And, subsequently, appeals to Rome became  frequent, until a satisfactory adjustment of the powers and privileges  of the two archbishops was arrived at. The Archbishop of Canterbury  was acknowledged Primate of all England and Metropolitan; but, while  the privilege of crowning the sovereign was reserved for the  Archbishop of Canterbury, that of crowning the Queen Consort was given  to the Archbishop of York.    [Illustration]      STRANGE OLD STORIES OF CHRISTMASTIDE.    The progress of literature under the Conqueror and his sons was very  great, many devoting themselves almost entirely to literary pursuits.  Lanfranc and Anselm, the Archbishops of Canterbury, had proved  themselves worthy of their exalted station. Their precepts and  examples had awakened the clergy and kindled an ardour for learning  unknown in any preceding age. Nor did this enthusiasm perish with its  authors: it was kept alive by the honours which were lavished on all  who could boast of literary acquirements. During the reign of Henry I.  Geoffrey of Monmouth published his History of the Britons, and William  of Malmesbury assures us that every poet hastened to the court of  Henry's Queen Matilda, at Westminster, to read his verses to the Queen  and partake of her bounty. William of Malmesbury carefully collected  the lighter ballads which embodied the popular traditions of the  English kings, and he tells an amusing story which is connected with  the festival of Christmas. In early times dancing developed into a  sort of passion, men and women continually dancing and singing  together, holding one another by the hands, and concluding the dances  with kisses. These levities were at first encouraged by the Church,  but afterwards, seeing the abuse of them, the priests were compelled  to reprimand and restrain the people. And the story told by William of  Malmesbury describes the singular punishment which came upon some  young men and women for disturbing a priest who was performing mass on  the eve of Christmas. \"I, Othbert, a sinner,\" says the story, \"have  lived to tell the tale. It was the vigil of the Blessed Virgin, and in  a town where was a church of St. Magnus. And the priest, Rathbertus,  had just begun the mass, and I, with my comrades, fifteen young women  and seventeen young men, were dancing outside the church. And we were  singing so loud that our songs were distinctly heard inside the  building, and interrupted the service of the mass. And the priest came  out and told us to desist; and when we did not, he prayed God and St.  Magnus that we might dance as our punishment for a year to come. A  youth, whose sister was dancing with us, seized her by the arm to drag  her away, but it came off in his hand, and she danced on. For a whole  year we continued. No rain fell on us; cold, nor heat, nor hunger, nor  thirst, nor fatigue affected us; neither our shoes nor our clothes  wore out; but still we went on dancing. We trod the earth down to our  knees, next to our middles, and at last were dancing in a pit. At the  end of the year release came.\"    Giraldus Cambrensis, amongst many ridiculous Christmas stories of  miracles, visions, and apparitions, tells of one devil who acted a  considerable time as a gentleman's butler with great prudence and  probity; and of another who was a very diligent and learned clergyman,  and a mighty favourite of his archbishop. This last clerical devil  was, it seems, an excellent historian, and used to divert the  Archbishop with telling him old stories, some of which referred to the  incarnation of our Saviour, and were related at the Christmas season.  \"Before the incarnation of our Saviour,\" said the Archbishop's  historian, \"the devils had great power over mankind, but after that  event their power was much diminished and they were obliged to fly.  Some of them threw themselves into the sea; some concealed themselves  in hollow trees, or in the clefts of rocks; and I myself plunged into  a certain fountain. As soon as he had said this, finding that he had  discovered his secret, his face was covered with blushes, he went out  of the room, and was no more seen.\"    The following cut (taken from MS. Harl., No. 4751, of the end of the  twelfth century) represents an elephant, with its castle and armed  men, engaged in battle. The bestiaries relate many strange things of  the elephant. They say that, though so large and powerful, and so  courageous against larger animals, it is afraid of a mouse; that its  nature is so cold that it will never seek the company of the female  until, wandering in the direction of Paradise, it meets with the plant  called the mandrake, and eats of it, and that each female bears but  one young one in her life.    [Illustration]    Absurd as we consider such stories, they were believed by the Normans,  who were no less credulous than the Anglo-Saxons. This is evident  from the large number of miracles, revelations, visions, and  enchantments which are related with great gravity by the old  chroniclers.    [Illustration]      THE MISRULE OF KING STEPHEN.    Stephen of Blois was crowned at Westminster Abbey during the Christmas  festival (December 26, 1135). As a King of Misrule, he was fitly  crowned at Christmastide, and it would have been a good thing for the  nation if his reign had been of the ephemeral character which was  customary to Lords of Misrule. The nineteen years of his reign were  years of disorder unparalleled in any period of our history. On the  landing of Henry the First's daughter, \"the Empress Matilda,\" who  claimed the English crown for her son Henry, a long struggle ensued,  and the country was divided between the adherents of the two rivals,  the West supporting Matilda, and London and the East Stephen. For a  time the successes in war alternated between the two parties. A defeat  at Lincoln left Stephen a prisoner in the hands of his enemies; but  after his escape he laid siege to the city of Oxford, where Matilda  had assembled her followers. \"The Lady\" of the English (as Matilda was  then called) had retreated into the castle, which, though a place of  great strength, proved to be insufficiently victualled. It was  surrounded and cut off from all supplies without, and at Christmastide  (1142), after a siege of three months, Matilda consulted her own  safety by taking flight. On a cold December night, when the ground was  covered with snow, she quitted the castle at midnight, attended by  four knights, who as well as herself were clothed in white, in order  that they might pass unobserved through the lines of their enemies.  The adventurous \"Lady\" made good her escape, and crossing the river  unnoticed on the ice, found her way to Abingdon. The long anarchy was  ended by the Treaty of Wallingford (1153), Stephen being recognised as  king during his life, and the succession devolving upon Matilda's son  Henry. A year had hardly passed from the signing of the treaty, when  Stephen's death gave Henry the crown, and his coronation took place at  Christmastide, 1154, at Westminster.      THE REIGN OF HENRY II.,    it has been truly said, \"initiated the rule of law,\" as distinct from  despotism, whether personal or tempered by routine, of the Norman  kings. And now the despotic barons began gradually to be shorn of  their power, and the dungeons of their \"Adulterine\" castles to be  stripped of their horrors, and it seemed more appropriate to celebrate  the season of glad tidings. King Henry the Second kept his first  Christmas at Bermondsey with great solemnity, "]]]
