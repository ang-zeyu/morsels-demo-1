That man is of a temper too severe;      Hard but as lofty as the rock, and free                            520      From all the taints of common earth--while I      Am softer clay, impregnated with flowers:      But as our mould is, must the produce be.      If I have erred this time, 'tis on the side      Where Error sits most lightly on that sense,      I know not what to call it; but it reckons      With me ofttimes for pain, and sometimes pleasure;      A spirit which seems placed about my heart      To count its throbs, not quicken them, and ask      Questions which mortal never dared to ask me,                      530      Nor Baal, though an oracular deity--[q]      Albeit his marble face majestical      Frowns as the shadows of the evening dim      His brows to changed expression, till at times      I think the statue looks in act to speak.      Away with these vain thoughts, I will be joyous--      And here comes Joy's true herald.                                 _Enter_ MYRRHA.        _Myr._                           King! the sky      Is overcast, and musters muttering thunder,      In clouds that seem approaching fast, and show      In forked flashes a commanding tempest.[r]                         540      Will you then quit the palace?        _Sar._                        Tempest, say'st thou?        _Myr._ Aye, my good lord.        _Sar._                    For my own part, I should be      Not ill content to vary the smooth scene,      And watch the warring elements; but this      Would little suit the silken garments and      Smooth faces of our festive friends. Say, Myrrha,      Art thou of those who dread the roar of clouds?        _Myr._ In my own country we respect their voices      As auguries of Jove.[s]        _Sar._              Jove!--aye, your Baal--      Ours also has a property in thunder,                               550      And ever and anon some falling bolt      Proves his divinity,--and yet sometimes      Strikes his own altars.        _Myr._                  That were a dread omen.        _Sar._ Yes--for the priests. Well, we will not go forth      Beyond the palace walls to-night, but make      Our feast within.        _Myr._             Now, Jove be praised! that he      Hath heard the prayer thou wouldst not hear. The Gods      Are kinder to thee than thou to thyself,      And flash this storm between thee and thy foes,      To shield thee from them.        _Sar._                   Child, if there be peril,                 560      Methinks it is the same within these walls      As on the river's brink.        _Myr._                   Not so; these walls      Are high and strong, and guarded. Treason has      To penetrate through many a winding way,      And massy portal; but in the pavilion      There is no bulwark.        _Sar._               No, nor in the palace,      Nor in the fortress, nor upon the top      Of cloud-fenced Caucasus, where the eagle sits      Nested in pathless clefts, if treachery be:      Even as the arrow finds the airy king,                             570      The steel will reach the earthly. But be calm;      The men, or innocent or guilty, are      Banished, and far upon their way.        _Myr._                            They live, then?        _Sar._ So sanguinary? _Thou!_        _Myr._                      I would not shrink      From just infliction of due punishment      On those who seek your life: were't otherwise,      I should not merit mine. Besides, you heard      The princely Salemenes.        _Sar._                  This is strange;      The gentle and the austere are both against me,      And urge me to revenge.        _Myr._                 'Tis a Greek virtue.                        580        _Sar._ But not a kingly one--I'll none on't; or      If ever I indulge in't, it shall be      With kings--my equals.        _Myr._                 These men sought to be so.        _Sar._ Myrrha, this is too feminine, and springs      From fear----        _Myr._       For you.        _Sar._               No matter, still 'tis fear.      I have observed your sex, once roused to wrath,      Are timidly vindictive to a pitch      Of perseverance, which I would not copy.      I thought you were exempt from this, as from      The childish helplessness of Asian women[t].                       590        _Myr._ My Lord, I am no boaster of my love,      Nor of my attributes; I have shared your splendour,      And will partake your fortunes. You may live      To find one slave more true than subject myriads:      But this the Gods avert! I am content      To be beloved on trust for what I feel,      Rather than prove it to you in your griefs[u],      Which might not yield to any cares of mine.        _Sar._ Grief cannot come where perfect love exists,      Except to heighten it, and vanish from                             600      That which it could not scare away. Let's in--      The hour approaches, and we must prepare      To meet the invited guests who grace our feast.

Here sorrow cannot reach.        _Zam._ Nor elsewhere--where the King is, pleasure sparkles.        _Sar._ Is not this better now than Nimrod's huntings,      Or my wild Grandam's chase in search of kingdoms      She could not keep when conquered?        _Alt._                            Mighty though      They were, as all thy royal line have been,      Yet none of those who went before have reached      The acme of Sardanapalus, who                                       10      Has placed his joy in peace--the sole true glory.        _Sar._ And pleasure, good Altada, to which glory      Is but the path. What is it that we seek?      Enjoyment! We have cut the way short to it,      And not gone tracking it through human ashes,      Making a grave with every footstep.        _Zam._                              No;      All hearts are happy, and all voices bless      The King of peace--who holds a world in jubilee.        _Sar._ Art sure of that? I have heard otherwise;      Some say that there be traitors.        _Zam._                           Traitors they                      20      Who dare to say so!--'Tis impossible.      What cause?        _Sar._      What cause? true,--fill the goblet up;      We will not think of them: there are none such,      Or if there be, they are gone.        _Alt._                         Guests, to my pledge!      Down on your knees, and drink a measure to      The safety of the King--the monarch, say I?      The God Sardanapalus!                                [ZAMES _and the Guests kneel, and exclaim_--                            Mightier than      His father Baal, the God Sardanapalus!                   [_It thunders as they kneel; some start up in confusion_.        _Zam._ Why do you rise, my friends? in that strong peal      His father gods consented.        _Myr._                     Menaced, rather.                         30      King, wilt thou bear this mad impiety?        _Sar._ Impiety!--nay, if the sires who reigned      Before me can be Gods, I'll not disgrace      Their lineage. But arise, my pious friends;      Hoard your devotion for the Thunderer there:      I seek but to be loved, not worshipped.        _Alt._                                 Both--      Both you must ever be by all true subjects.        _Sar._ Methinks the thunders still increase: it is      An awful night.        _Myr._          Oh yes, for those who have      No palace to protect their worshippers.                             40        _Sar._ That's true, my Myrrha; and could I convert      My realm to one wide shelter for the wretched,      I'd do it.        _Myr._   Thou'rt no God, then--not to be      Able to work a will so good and general,      As thy wish would imply.        _Sar._                   And your Gods, then,      Who can, and do not?        _Myr._               Do not speak of that,      Lest we provoke them.        _Sar._                True--, they love not censure      Better than mortals. Friends, a thought has struck me:      Were there no temples, would there, think ye, be      Air worshippers?[v] that is, when it is angry,                      50      And pelting as even now.        _Myr._                 The Persian prays      Upon his mountain.        _Sar._             Yes, when the Sun shines.        _Myr._ And I would ask if this your palace were      Unroofed and desolate, how many flatterers      Would lick the dust in which the King lay low?        _Alt._ The fair Ionian is too sarcastic      Upon a nation whom she knows not well;      The Assyrians know no pleasure but their King's,      And homage is their pride.        _Sar._                     Nay, pardon, guests,      The fair Greek's readiness of speech.        _Alt._                               _Pardon!_ sire:                60      We honour her of all things next to thee.      Hark! what was that?        _Zam._               That! nothing but the jar      Of distant portals shaken by the wind.        _Alt._ It sounded like the clash of--hark again!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23494"],[0,"Notable Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold (#11)"],[1,"way to the ships.    Leaving Guadaloupe on the 10th, Columbus passed Mont Serrat and Antigua,  and, the weather becoming boisterous, anchored off an island, to which  he gave the name of Santa Cruz.  Here a boat was sent on shore, and the  crew visited a village, deserted by the men, but secured a few women and  boys, most of them captives from other islands.  On returning they saw a  canoe, the people in which--two of whom were women--were so entranced at  the sight of the ships that the boat got close up before they perceived  it.  The Indians now attempted to escape, but, finding their retreat cut  off, they plied their bows and arrows so rapidly that two Spaniards were  wounded, the women fighting as fiercely as the men.  Though the canoe  was upset, the savages still, while swimming, discharged their arrows at  their foes.  They were, however, captured and brought on board, some of  them wounded.    One of them was evidently their Queen.  She was accompanied by her son,  a young man strongly made, with a frowning brow and a lion's face.  The  hair of these savages was long and coarse, and their eyes were encircled  with paint, so as to give them a hideous expression.    Though captives in chains, they still retained their defiant air.  They  were afterwards carried prisoners to Spain.  One of the Spaniards died  of a wound from a poisoned arrow shot by one of the women.    After this Columbus reached a group of upwards of fifty small islands,  to which the name of Saint Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins was  given.  Continuing his course, he came off a beautiful island, covered  with forests and indented with fine havens.  It is now known by the name  of Porto Rico.  This was the island from which most of the captives who  had fled to the ships had been taken by the Caribs.    After running for a whole day along this beautiful coast, the squadron  anchored in a bay at the west end, abounding in fish.    On landing they found an Indian village constructed round a common  square like a market-place, with one large and well-built house in it.  A wide road led thence to the sea-shore, fenced on either side.    The whole place had an air of great neatness.  Not a human being,  however, was to be seen, the natives having concealed themselves.    After remaining here two days Columbus stood for Hispaniola.  This ended  his cruise among the Caribbean Islands, the inhabitants of which he  described as cannibals, and the most warlike people hitherto met with.    On the 22nd of November the squadron came off the eastern end of  Hispaniola, or Hayti, and the sailor who had died of his wound was here  sent on shore to be buried.    Several natives came off with a message from the cacique of the  neighbourhood inviting Columbus to land, and promising great quantities  of gold, but, anxious to reach La Navidad, he continued his course.  The  next place he put into was Las Flechas, where he landed one of the young  Indians, who it was supposed had been converted to Christianity,  handsomely apparelled and loaded with trinkets.  But the youth either  forgot his promises or was murdered on account of his finery, as nothing  more was heard of him.    Only one young Indian, who had been sent by Guacanagari, and who, having  been to Spain, had been baptised and named after the Admiral's brother,  Diego Colon, remained on board, and he continued always devoted to the  Spaniards.    On the 25th Columbus anchored in the harbour of Monte Cristo, wishing to  form a settlement in the neighbourhood of the stream to which he had  before given the name of the Golden River.    Near this, on the green banks of a rivulet, the bodies of a man and boy  were found, the former with a cord of Spanish grass about his neck, his  arms extended and tied by the wrists to a stake in the form of a cross.    It was impossible, from the state of decay in which they were found, to  ascertain whether they were European or Indians.  Painful doubts,  however, were raised, and the following day two other bodies were  discovered, one of which was evidently the corpse of a white man.    Gloomy forebodings were now raised as to the fate which might have  befallen Arana and his garrison.  The frank and fearless conduct,  however, of the natives who came off to the ships somewhat allayed the  suspicions of Columbus.  He sailed on, hoping to find the greater part  of the garrison alive, until he arrived off the harbour of La Navidad,  late on the evening of the 27th.  Two guns were fired, but no reply was  received.  While waiting in dismal suspense for the morning, about  midnight a canoe approached the fleet; but the people in it would not  come on board until they perceived the Admiral standing on the deck of  his ship, when they came up the side without hesitation.  One of them  was a cousin of the cacique Guacanagari.  He brought a present of two  masks ornamented with gold.    To the inquiries of Columbus as to what had become of the garrison, the  Indians replied that several had died of sickness, others had fallen in  a quarrel among themselves, and others had removed to different parts of  the island, where they had married native wives.  He added that  Guacanagari had been attacked by the fierce cacique of the Golden  Mountains of Cibao, who had wounded him in battle and burnt his village,  and that he still remained ill of his wound in a neighbouring hamlet.  Columbus was greatly relieved on finding that the cacique and his people  still remained faithful, and he hoped that some of the Spaniards  scattered about the country, on hearing of his arrival, would quickly  hasten on board.    In the morning, however, not a canoe was to be seen.  The inhabitants,  too, kept out of the way.  A boat was therefore sent on shore.  On  landing, the crew hastened to the fortress.  It was a ruin.  The  palisades were beaten down, and the whole presented the appearance of  having been sacked, burnt, and destroyed.    Columbus, on visiting the ruins the next morning, discovered no dead  bodies, but broken utensils and torn vestments were found scattered here  and there among the grass.    In vain cannon and arquebuses were fired.  Proceeding along the coast in  a boat for about a league, Columbus came to a hamlet, the inhabitants of  which had fled with their goods.  In their houses, however, were found  European articles, such as stockings, pieces of cloth, and a Moorish  robe.  While he was absent the bodies of eleven Europeans were  discovered buried in different places, evidently some time dead, as  grass had grown over their graves.    At length the Indians, recovering from their alarm, came up to the  Spaniards, and from them the fate of the garrison was in some measure  ascertained.    With the exception of Arana and two or three others, the people left  behind had disobeyed all the orders given by Columbus.  The simple  natives soon discovered that the beings they had at first worshipped as  gods were gross sensualists, who carried off their wives and daughters,  and possessed themselves of their gold and property by fraud and  violence.    In vain Arana interposed his authority.  His lieutenants deserted him  and set off on an expedition to the mines of Cibao, where they were  captured by Caonabo and put to death.  Others, abandoning the fortress,  lived carelessly about the neighbourhood, and Caonabo burst upon the  fortress while the residue of the garrison were asleep, and, setting it  on fire, massacred some, while others fled to the sea and were drowned.    Guacanagari and his people had fought faithfully in defence of their  guests, but were easily routed, and the cacique being wounded, his  village was burnt to the ground.    Columbus afterwards visited the unfortunate Guacanagari, who received  him in the same friendly spirit as before; but Father Boyle and others  declared their belief that he was acting a treacherous part, and  advised, when he afterwards returned the Admiral's visit, that he should  be detained.  Columbus, however, rejected the counsel of his followers  as contrary to sound policy and honourable faith.  The cacique, seeing  that he was mistrusted, took his departure, and for long kept out of the  way of the Spaniards.    Finding that this was not a suitable place for a settlement, Columbus  weighed anchor on the 7th of December, but in consequence of adverse  weather he put into a harbour about ten leagues east of Monte Cristo.  He was here struck by the advantages of its spacious harbour, there  being also two rivers watering a green and beautiful plain, while the  soil appeared to be fertile, and excellent fish were found.  It was also  at no great distance from the mountains of Cibao.    It being considered, therefore, that no situation more favourable for  the projected colony could be found, the troops and labourers were  landed with their provisions, articles for traffic, guns, ammunition,  and live stock of all sorts, and an encampment was formed round a sheet  of water.    Streets and squares were projected; a church, public storehouse, and a  residence for the Admiral were commenced.  These were built of stone.  The other houses were constructed of wood, plaster, and reeds; and for a  short time every one exerted himself with the utmost zeal.    To the first Christian city in the New World thus founded Columbus gave  the name of Isabella, in honour of his royal patroness.  Sickness,  however, soon broke out among the colonists, several died, and even  Columbus was confined for many weeks to his bed.    Notwithstanding his illness, he continued to give directions,  superintending the building of the city and the management of the fleet.  His mind, however, was oppressed with the thought that, in consequence  of the destruction of the fortress, he should be compelled to send back  the ships empty, instead of laden with gold and spices, to the great  disappointment of the sovereigns.
