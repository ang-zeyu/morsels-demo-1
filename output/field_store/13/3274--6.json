[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1951"],[0,"The Coming Race (#11)"],[1,"though they do not contend that the idea of a  Diety is innate, yet they say that the An (man) is the only creature,  so far as their observation of nature extends, to whom 'the capacity  of conceiving that idea,' with all the trains of thought which open out  from it, is vouchsafed. They hold that this capacity is a privilege that  cannot have been given in vain, and hence that prayer and thanksgiving  are acceptable to the divine Creator, and necessary to the complete  development of the human creature. They offer their devotions both in  private and public. Not being considered one of their species, I was  not admitted into the building or temple in which the public worship is  rendered; but I am informed that the service is exceedingly short, and  unattended with any pomp of ceremony. It is a doctrine with the Vril-ya,  that earnest devotion or complete abstraction from the actual world  cannot, with benefit to itself, be maintained long at a stretch by the  human mind, especially in public, and that all attempts to do so either  lead to fanaticism or to hypocrisy. When they pray in private, it is  when they are alone or with their young children.    They say that in ancient times there was a great number of books written  upon speculations as to the nature of the Diety, and upon the forms of  belief or worship supposed to be most agreeable to Him. But these were  found to lead to such heated and angry disputations as not only to shake  the peace of the community and divide families before the most united,  but in the course of discussing the attributes of the Diety, the  existence of the Diety Himself became argued away, or, what was  worse, became invested with the passions and infirmities of the human  disputants. \"For,\" said my host, \"since a finite being like an An cannot  possibly define the Infinite, so, when he endeavours to realise an idea  of the Divinity, he only reduces the Divinity into an An like himself.\"  During the later ages, therefore, all theological speculations, though  not forbidden, have been so discouraged as to have fallen utterly  into disuse. The Vril-ya unite in a conviction of a future state, more  felicitous and more perfect than the present. If they have very vague  notions of the doctrine of rewards and punishments, it is perhaps  because they have no systems of rewards and punishments among  themselves, for there are no crimes to punish, and their moral standard  is so even that no An among them is, upon the whole, considered more  virtuous than another. If one excels, perhaps in one virtue, another  equally excels in some other virtue; If one has his prevalent fault or  infirmity, so also another has his. In fact, in their extraordinary  mode of life. There are so few temptations to wrong, that they are good  (according to their notions of goodness) merely because they live.  They have some fanciful notions upon the continuance of life, when once  bestowed, even in the vegetable world, as the reader will see in the  next chapter.        Chapter XIV.      Though, as I have said, the Vril-ya discourage all speculations on the  nature of the Supreme Being, they appear to concur in a belief by which  they think to solve that great problem of the existence of evil which  has so perplexed the philosophy of the upper world. They hold that  wherever He has once given life, with the perceptions of that life,  however faint it be, as in a plant, the life is never destroyed; it  passes into new and improved forms, though not in this planet (differing  therein from the ordinary doctrine of metempsychosis), and that the  living thing retains the sense of identity, so that it connects its past  life with its future, and is 'conscious' of its progressive improvement  in the scale of joy. For they say that, without this assumption, they  cannot, according to the lights of human reason vouchsafed to them,  discover the perfect justice which must be a constituent quality of the  All-Wise and the All-Good. Injustice, they say, can only emanate  from three causes: want of wisdom to perceive what is just, want of  benevolence to desire, want of power to fulfill it; and that each of  these three wants is incompatible in the All-Wise, the All-Good,  the All-Powerful. But that, while even in this life, the wisdom,  the benevolence, and the power of the Supreme Being are sufficiently  apparent to compel our recognition, the justice necessarily resulting  from those attributes, absolutely requires another life, not for man  only, but for every living thing of the inferior orders. That, alike in  the animal and the vegetable world, we see one individual rendered, by  circumstances beyond its control, exceedingly wretched compared to its  neighbours--one only exists as the prey of another--even a plant suffers  from disease till it perishes prematurely, while the plant next to it  rejoices in its vitality and lives out its happy life free from a pang.  That it is an erroneous analogy from human infirmities to reply by  saying that the Supreme Being only acts by general laws, thereby making  his own secondary causes so potent as to mar the essential kindness of  the First Cause; and a still meaner and more ignorant conception of the  All-Good, to dismiss with a brief contempt all consideration of justice  for the myriad forms into which He has infused life, and assume that  justice is only due to the single product of the An. There is no small  and no great in the eyes of the divine Life-Giver. But once grant that  nothing, however humble, which feels that it lives and suffers, can  perish through the series of ages, that all its suffering here, if  continuous from the moment of its birth to that of its transfer to  another form of being, would be more brief compared with eternity than  the cry of the new-born is compared to the whole life of a man; and once  suppose that this living thing retains its sense of identity when so  transformed (for without that sense it could be aware of no future  being), and though, indeed, the fulfilment of divine justice is removed  from the scope of our ken, yet we have a right to assume it to be  uniform and universal, and not varying and partial, as it would be  if acting only upon general and secondary laws; because such perfect  justice flows of necessity from perfectness of knowledge to conceive,  perfectness of love to will, and perfectness of power to complete it.    However fantastic this belief of the Vril-ya may be, it tends perhaps to  confirm politically the systems of government which, admitting different  degrees of wealth, yet establishes perfect equality in rank, exquisite  mildness in all relations and intercourse, and tenderness to all created  things which the good of the community does not require them to destroy.  And though their notion of compensation to a tortured insect or a  cankered flower may seem to some of us a very wild crotchet, yet,  at least, is not a mischievous one; and it may furnish matter for no  unpleasing reflection to think that within the abysses of earth, never  lit by a ray from the material heavens, there should have penetrated so  luminous a conviction of the ineffable goodness of the Creator--so  fixed an idea that the general laws by which He acts cannot admit of any  partial injustice or evil, and therefore cannot be comprehended without  reference to their action over all space and throughout all time. And  since, as I shall have occasion to observe later, the intellectual  conditions and social systems of this subterranean race comprise and  harmonise great, and apparently antagonistic, varieties in philosophical  doctrine and speculation which have from time to time been started,  discussed, dismissed, and have re-appeared amongst thinkers or dreamers  in the upper world,--so I may perhaps appropriately conclude this  reference to the belief of the Vril-ya, that self-conscious or sentient  life once given is indestructible among inferior creatures as well as  in man, by an eloquent passage from the work of that eminent zoologist,  Louis Agassiz, which I have only just met with, many years after I had  committed to paper these recollections of the life of the Vril-ya which  I now reduce into something like arrangement and form: \"The relations  which individual animals bear to one another are of such a character  that they ought long ago to have been considered as sufficient proof  that no organised being could ever have been called into existence by  other agency than by the direct intervention of a reflective mind.  This argues strongly in favour of the existence in every animal of  an immaterial principle similar to that which by its excellence and  superior endowments places man so much above the animals; yet the  principle unquestionably exists, and whether it be called sense, reason,  or instinct, it presents in the whole range of organised beings a series  of phenomena closely linked together, and upon it are based not only  the higher manifestations of the mind, but the very permanence of the  specific differences which characterise every organism. Most of the  arguments in favour of the immortality of man apply equally to the  permanency of this principle in other living beings. May I not add that  a future life in which man would be deprived of that great source of  enjoyment and intellectual and moral improvement which results from  the contemplation of the harmonies of an organic world would involve  a lamentable loss? And may we not look to a spiritual concert of the  combined worlds and ALL their inhabitants in the presence of  their Creator as the highest conception of paradise?\"--'Essay on  Classification,' sect. xvii. p. 97-99.

The Redcotte chantry possessed sundry vestments, the gift of Margaret  Rempstone, in the thirty-fifth year of Henry VI., and plate, an  inventory of which exists. This plate, on the dissolution of chantries,  was given by the parishioners to the king, Edward VI. The hospital or  almshouses stands on the high road from Wimborne to Blandford; the  chapel joins one of the tenements occupied by the almsmen. These  tenements are nine in number; three are inhabited by married couples,  three by men, and three by women. Some of these cottages are of half  timber, and thatched, others of modern brick. The chapel, at which there  is now a service every Thursday afternoon, conducted by one of the  minster clergy, is a plain building, which has been recently refitted,  but remains, as far as windows and walls are concerned, in its original  state. There are three doors in the north wall; the heads are pointed,  and it is noteworthy that in the central door, that generally used  for access to the chapel, the two sides of the arch are of different  curvatures, so that the point of the arch is nearer to the right-hand  side. The edge of the wall is chamfered round the doorways. The east  window has a semicircular head, and plain wooden tracery dividing it  into two lancet-headed lights with an opening above them. There is a  window in both the south and north walls, near the east end, each of  two lights; the south window is widely splayed inside; the head of each  light has one cusp on each side. The head of each light of the north  window has two cusps on each side. Farther to the west, on the south  side, is a single narrow lancet, widely splayed, and still farther to  the west is a semicircular opening with wooden tracery. The general  character of the masonry would indicate that local workmen were employed  in building this chapel, and that little was spent in ornamenting it at  the time of the erection. There are, however, some traces of frescoes  on the inside of the walls, both geometrical patterns and figures. The  pointed doorways and the lancet window on the south side would indicate  the thirteenth century as the date of the original building, and this  agrees with the documentary evidence mentioned above for the foundation  of the hospital. The roof is an open one of massive wooden rafters, with  the beams running across at the level of the wall plates.

CHRISTCHURCH PRIORY      [Illustration: CHRISTCHURCH PRIORY, FROM THE BRIDGE.]          CHRISTCHURCH PRIORY          CHAPTER I    HISTORY OF THE BUILDING      On the promontory washed on the one side by the slow stream of the  Dorset Stour, and on the other by the no less sluggish flow of the  Wiltshire Avon, not far from the place where they mingle their waters  before making their way amid mudflats and sandbanks into the English  Channel, stands, and has stood for more than eight hundred years, the  stately Priory Church which gives the name of Christchurch to a small  town in the county of Hants. The massive walls of its Norman nave, its  fifteenth-century tower, and its great length--for, from the east wall  of its Lady Chapel to the west wall of its tower, it measures no less  than 311 feet--make it a conspicuous object from the Channel, especially  after sundown, when its form, rising above the low shore of Christchurch  Bay, is silhouetted against the sky. It is one of the finest churches  below cathedral rank that is to be found in England. It is a perfect  mine of wealth to the student of architecture, containing examples of  every style from its early, possibly Saxon, crypt to the Renaissance of  its chantries. Here we may see the solid grandeur of Norman masonry in  the nave, with its massive arcading and richly-wrought triforium; the  graceful beauty of the Early English in its north porch and in the  windows of the north aisle of the nave; the more fully developed  Decorated in the windows of the south aisle of the same; and  Perpendicular in the tower and Lady Chapel.    The crypts beneath the north transept and the presbytery may have  belonged to the original church, but of that which is visible above  ground the oldest part was due to Flambard, of whom more hereafter.  When the first church was founded we cannot tell. Here, as in many other  places, the origin is lost in the haze of antiquity and legend. Here,  as at many other places, we find the original builders choosing one  site, and the stones that they had laid during the day being removed by  night by unseen, and therefore angelic, hands to another. It was on the  heights of St Catharine, about a mile and a half away from the present  site, that the human builders strove to raise their church. It may be  that this hill, still marked by the ramparts of an ancient encampment,  was not holy ground on account of its former occupation by heathens,  though in after time, a chapel, built in the early part of the  fourteenth century, existed there; but, anyhow, not on this hill, but on  the flat lands of Saxon Tweoxneham, a name which passed into the forms  of Thuinam and Twynham, that the great Priory Church was destined to  stand. But not even when the human builders began to erect the church  on the miraculously chosen ground did supernatural interposition cease.  A stranger workman came and laboured at the building: never was he seen  to eat as the other workmen did, never did he come with his fellows to  receive his wages. Once, when a beam had been cut too short for the  place it was to occupy, he lengthened it by drawing it out with his  hand; and when the day for consecration came, and the other workmen  gathered together to see their work hallowed by due ceremonial, this  stranger workman was nowhere to be seen. The ecclesiastics came to  the conclusion that this was none other than the carpenter's son of  Nazareth, and the church which had in part been builded by the hands  of the Christ Himself in later days became known as Christchurch.    But, if we disregard these legends, we do not at once find ourselves  on sure and certain ground. The foundation has been attributed to  AEthelstan, but this is hardly likely, as, in a charter dated 939, he  gives one of the weirs on the Avon at Twynham to the Abbey Church of  Middleton, now Milton Abbey in North Dorset, which he would be hardly  likely to do if he had founded, or were thinking of founding, a  religious house at Twynham; and as he died in 940, not much time was  left for any foundation after this grant. Again, we find King Eadred  granting land and fishing near Twineham to Dunstan. However, in the  time of the Confessor, mention is made of the canons of Holy Trinity  possessing lands in Thuinam. It must be remembered that it had been  intended, according to the legend, to dedicate the church to the Holy  Trinity, and no doubt this was done, although it was afterwards  identified especially with the second Person.    In Domesday it is stated that the canons of the Church of the Holy  Trinity hold lands in the village, and also in the Isle of Wight  opposite. Certain it is that in the days of Eadward the Confessor there  was a church at Twynham dedicated to the Holy Trinity, held by a  collegiate society of secular canons. This church was swept away by  Ranulf Flambard, the notorious justiciar and chaplain of William II.,  whose evil deeds, contrary to the oft-quoted passage from Mark Antony's  speech in Julius Caesar, are now generally forgotten; while the good  deeds that he wrought,--the nave of this "]]]
