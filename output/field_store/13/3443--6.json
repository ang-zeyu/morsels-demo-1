[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22766"],[0,"Electricity for Boys (#11)"],[1,"below the key (A) is a screw (G), so that the key will  strike it when moved downwardly. The other end of the bar (F) contacts  with the forward end of the switch bar (E) when the latter is moved  inwardly.    [Illustration: _Fig. 67._ TELEGRAPH SENDING KEY]    The forward end of the key (A) has a knob (H) for the fingers, and the  rear end has an elastic (I) attached thereto which is secured to the end  of the base, so that, normally, the rear end is held against the base  and away from the screw head (G). The head (J) of a screw projects from  the base at its rear end. Key A contacts with it.    When the key A contacts with the screw heads G, J, a click is produced,  one when the key is pressed down and the other when the key is released.    You will notice that the two plates C, F are connected up in circuit  with the battery, so that, as the switch E is thrown, so as to be out of  contact, the circuit is open, and may be closed either by the key A or  the switch E. The use of the switch will be illustrated in connection  with the sounder.    [Illustration: _Fig. 68._ TELEGRAPH SOUNDER]    When the key A is depressed, the circuit of course goes through plate C,  key A and plate F to the station signalled.    THE SOUNDER.--The sounder is the instrument which carries the  electro-magnet.    In Fig. 68 this is shown in perspective. The base is six inches long and  four inches wide, being made, preferably, of wood. Near the forward end  is mounted a pair of electro-magnets (A, A), with their terminal wires  connected up with plates B, B', to which the line wires are attached.    Midway between the magnets and the rear end of the base is a pair of  upwardly projecting brackets (C). Between these are pivoted a bar (D),  the forward end of which rests between the magnets and carries, thereon,  a cross bar (E) which is directly above the magnets, and serves as the  armature.    The rear end of the base has a screw (F) directly beneath the bar D of  such height that when the rear end of the bar D is in contact therewith  the armature E will be out of contact with the magnet cores (A, A). A  spiral spring (G) secured to the rear ends of the arm and to the base,  respectively, serves to keep the rear end of the key normally in contact  with the screw F.    CONNECTING UP THE KEY AND SOUNDER.--Having made these two instruments,  we must next connect them up in the circuit, or circuits, formed for  them, as there must be a battery, a key, and a sounder at each end of  the line.    In Fig. 69 you will note two groups of those instruments. Now observe  how the wires connect them together. There are two line wires, one (A)  which connects up the two batteries, the wire being attached so that  one end connects with the positive terminal of the battery, and the  other end with the negative terminal.    [Illustration: _Fig. 69._ A TELEGRAPH CIRCUIT]    The other line wire (B), between the two stations, has its opposite ends  connected with the terminals of the electro-magnet C of the sounders.  The other terminals of each electro-magnet are connected up with one  terminal of each key by a wire (D), and to complete the circuit at each  station, the other terminal of the key has a wire (E) to its own  battery.    TWO STATIONS IN CIRCUIT.--The illustration shows station 2 telegraphing  to station 1. This is indicated by the fact that the switch F' of that  instrument is open, and the switch F of station 1 closed. When,  therefore, the key of station 2 is depressed, a complete circuit is  formed which transmits the current through wire E' and battery, through  line A, then through the battery of station 1, through wire E to the  key, and from the key, through wire D, to the sounder, and finally from  the sounder over line wire B back to the sounder of station 2,  completing the circuit at the key through wire D'.    When the operator at station 2 closes the switch F', and the operator at  station 1 opens the switch F, the reverse operation takes place. In both  cases, however, the sounder is in at both ends of the line, and only the  circuit through the key is cut out by the switch F, or F'.    THE DOUBLE CLICK.--The importance of the double click of the sounder  will be understood when it is realized that the receiving operator must  have some means of determining if the sounder has transmitted a dot or a  dash. Whether he depresses the key for a dot or a dash, there must be  one click when the key is pressed down on the screw head G (Fig. 62),  and also another click, of a different kind, when the key is raised up  so that its rear end strikes the screw head J. This action of the key is  instantly duplicated by the bar D (Fig. 68) of the sounder, so that the  sounder as well as the receiver knows the time between the first and the  second click, and by that means he learns that a dot or a dash is made.    ILLUSTRATING THE DOT AND THE DASH.--To illustrate: Let us suppose, for  convenience, that the downward movement of the lever in the key, and the  bar in the sounder, make a sharp click, and the return of the lever and  bar make a dull click. In this case the ear, after a little practice,  can learn readily how to distinguish the number of downward impulses  that have been given to the key.    _The Morse Telegraph Code_    A . -        N - .       & . ...

Now a dash by itself may be an L, a T, or  the figure 0, dependent upon its length. The short dash is T, and the  longest dash the figure 0. The operator will soon learn whether it is  either of these or the letter L, which is intermediate in length.    In time the sender as well as receiver will give a uniform length to the  dash impulse, so that it may be readily distinguished. In the same way,  we find that R, which is indicated by a dot, is followed, after a short  interval, by two dots. This might readily be mistaken for the single dot  for E and the two dots for I, were it not that the time element in R is  not as long between the first and second dots, as it ordinarily is  between the single dot of E when followed by the two dots of I.          CHAPTER X    HIGH TENSION APPARATUS, CONDENSERS, ETC.      INDUCTION.--One of the most remarkable things in electricity is the  action of induction--that property of an electric current which enables  it to pass from one conductor to another conductor through the air.  Another singular and interesting thing is that the current so  transmitted across spaces changes its direction of flow, and,  furthermore, the tension of such a current may be changed by  transmitting it from one conductor to another.    LOW AND HIGH TENSION.--In order to effect this latter change--that is,  to convert it from a low tension to a high tension--coils are used, one  coil being wound upon the other; one of these coils is called the  primary and the other the secondary. The primary coil receives the  current from the battery, or source of electrical power, and the  secondary coil receives charges, and transmits the current.    For an illustration of this examine Fig. 70, in which you will note a  coil of heavy wire (A), around which is wound a coil of fine wire (B).  If, for instance, the primary coil has a low voltage, the secondary  coil will have a high voltage, or tension. Advantage is taken of this  phase to use a few cells, as a primary battery, and then, by a set of  _Induction Coils_, as they are called, to build up a high-tension  electro-motive force, so that the spark will jump across a gap, as shown  at C, for the purpose of igniting the charges of gas in a gasoline  motor; or the current may be used for medical batteries, and for other  purposes.    [Illustration: _Fig. 70._ INDUCTION COIL AND CIRCUIT]    The current passes, by induction, from the primary to the secondary  coil. It passes from a large conductor to a small conductor, the small  conductor having a much greater resistance than the large one.    ELASTIC PROPERTY OF ELECTRICITY.--While electricity has no resiliency,  like a spring, for instance, still it acts in the manner of a cushion  under certain conditions. It may be likened to an oscillating spring  acted upon by a bar.    Referring to Fig. 71, we will assume that the bar A in falling down upon  the spring B compresses the latter, so that at the time of greatest  compression the bar goes down as far as the dotted line C. It is obvious  that the spring B will throw the bar upwardly. Now, electricity appears  to have a kind of elasticity, which characteristic is taken advantage of  in order to increase the efficiency of the induction in the coil.    [Illustration: _Fig. 71._ ILLUSTRATING ELASTICITY]    THE CONDENSER.--To make a condenser, prepare two pine boards like A,  say, eight by ten inches and a half inch thick, and shellac thoroughly  on all sides. Then prepare sheets of tinfoil (B), six by eight inches in  size, and also sheets of paraffined paper (C), seven by nine inches in  dimensions. Also cut out from the waste pieces of tinfoil strips (D),  one inch by two inches. To build up the condenser, lay down a sheet of  paraffined paper (C), then a sheet of tinfoil (B), and before putting  on the next sheet of paraffined "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22771"],[0,"Cattle and Their Diseases (#11)"],[1," mirror will resemble that of the cow, but  will be of less size.    With calves, however, it should be stated, in addition, that the  milk-mirrors are more distinctly recognized on those from cows that are  well kept, and that they will generally be fully developed at two years  old. Some changes take place in the course of years, but the outlines of  the mirror appear prominent at the time of advanced pregnancy, or, in  the case of cows giving milk, at the times when the udder is more  distended with milk than at others.    M. Mayne, who has explained and simplified the method of M. Guenon,  divides cows, according to the quantity which they give, into four  classes: first, the very good; second, the good; third, the medium; and  fourth, the bad.    In the FIRST class he places cows, both parts of whose milk mirror, the  mammary--the tuft situated on the udder, the legs and the thighs--and  the perinean--that on the perineum, extending sometimes more or less out  upon the thighs--are large, continuous, and uniform, covering at least  a great part of the perineum, the udder, the inner surface of the  thighs, and extending more or less out upon the legs, as in cut A, with  no interruptions, or, if any, small ones, oval in form, and situated on  the posterior face of the udder.    [Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [G.]]    Such mirrors are found on most very good cows, but may also be found on  cows which can scarcely be called good, and which should be ranked in  the next class. But cows, whether having very well developed mirrors or  not, may be reckoned as very good, and as giving as much milk as is to  be expected from their size, food, and the hygienic circumstances in  which they are kept, if they present the following characteristics:  veins of the perineum large, as if swollen, and visible on the  exterior--as in cut A--or which can easily be made to appear by pressing  upon the base of the perineum; veins of the udder large and knotted;  milk-veins large, often double, equal on both sides, and forming  zig-zags, under the belly.    To the signs furnished by the veins and by the mirror, may be added also  the following marks: a uniform, very large, and yielding udder,  shrinking much in milking, and covered with soft skin and fine hair;  good constitution, full chest, regular appetite, and great propensity to  drink. Such cows rather incline to be poor than to be fat. The skin is  soft and yielding; short, fine hair; small head; fine horns; bright,  sparkling eye; mild expression; feminine look; with a fine neck.    Cows of this first class are very rare. They give, even when small in  size, from ten to fourteen quarts of milk a day; and the largest sized  from eighteen to twenty-six quarts a day, and even more. Just after  calving, if arrived at maturity and fed with good, wholesome, moist food  in sufficient quantity and quality, adapted to promote the secretion of  milk, they can give about a pint of milk for every ten ounces of hay, or  its equivalent, which they eat.    They continue in milk for a long period. The best never go dry, and may  be milked even up to the time of calving, giving from eight to ten  quarts of milk a day. But even the best cows often fall short of the  quantity of milk which they are able to give, from being fed on food  which is too dry, or not sufficiently varied, or not rich enough in  nutritive qualities, or deficient in quantity.    [Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [H.]]    The SECOND class is that of _good cows_; and to this belong the best  commonly found in the market and among the cow-feeders of cities.    They have the mammary part of the milk-mirror well developed, but the  perinean part contracted, or wholly wanting, as in cut G; or both parts  of the mirror are moderately developed, or slightly indented, as in cut  H. Cut E belongs also to this class, in the lower part; but it indicates  a cow, which--as the upper mirror, 1, indicates--dries up sooner when  again in calf.    These marks, though often seen in many good cows, should be considered  as certain only when the veins of the perineum form, under the skin, a  kind of network, which, without being very apparent, may be felt by a  pressure on them; when the milk-veins on the belly are well-developed,  though less knotty and less prominent than in cows of the first class;  in short, when the udder is well developed, and presents veins which are  sufficiently numerous, though not very large.    It is necessary here, as in the preceding class, to distrust cows in  which the mirror is not accompanied by large veins. This remark applies  especially to cows which have had several calves, and are in full milk.  They are medium or bad, let the milk-mirror be what it may, if the veins  of the belly are not large, and those of the udder apparent.    The general characteristics which depend on form and constitution  combine, less than in cows of the preceding class, the marks of good  health and excellent constitution with those of a gentle and feminine  look.    Small cows of this class give from seven to ten or eleven quarts of milk  a day, and the largest from thirteen to seventeen quarts. They can be  made to give three-fourths of a pint of milk, just after calving, for  every ten ounces of hay consumed, if well cared for, and fed in a manner  favorable to the secretion of milk.    They hold out long in milk, when they have no upper mirrors or tufts. At  seven or eight months in calf, they may give from five to eight quarts  of milk a day.    The THIRD class consists of _middling cows_. When the milk-mirror  really presents only the mammary or lower part slightly indicated or  developed, and the perinean part contracted, narrow, and irregular--as  in cut K--the cows are middling. The udder is slightly developed or  hard, and shrinks very little after milking. The veins of the perineum  are not apparent, and those which run along the lower side of the  abdomen are small, straight, and sometimes unequal. In this case the  mirror is not symmetrical, and the cow gives more milk on the side where  the vein is the largest.    [Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [K.]]    These cows have large heads, and a thick, hard skin. Being ordinarily in  good condition, they are beautiful to look at, and seem to be well  formed. Many of them are nervous and restive, and not easily approached.    Cows of this class give, according to size, from three or four to ten  quarts of milk. They very rarely give, even in the most favorable  circumstances, half a pint of milk for every ten ounces of hay which  they consume. The milk diminishes rapidly, and dries up wholly the  fourth or fifth month in calf.    The FOURTH class is composed of _bad cows_. As they are commonly in  good condition, these cows are often the most beautiful of the herd and  in the markets. They have fleshy thighs, thick and hard skin, a large  and coarse neck and head, and horns large at the base.    The udder is hard, small and fleshy, with a skin covered with long,  rough hair. No veins are to be seen either on the perineum or the udder,  while those of the belly are slightly developed, and the mirrors are  ordinarily small, as in cut L.    With these characteristics, cows give only a few quarts of milk a day,  and dry up in a short time after calving. Some of them can scarcely  nourish their calves, even when they are properly cared for and well  fed.    Sickly habits, chronic affections of the digestive organs, the chest,  the womb, and the lacteal system, sometimes greatly affect the milk  secretion, and cause cows troubled with them to fall from the first or  second to the third, and sometimes to the fourth class.    Without pushing this method of judging of the good milking qualities of  cows into the objectionable extreme to which it was carried by its  originator, it may be safely asserted that the milk-mirror forms an  important additional mark or point for distinguishing good milkers; and  it may be laid down as a rule that, in the selection of milch cows, as  well as in the choice of young animals for breeders, the milk-mirror  should, by all means, be examined and considered; but that we should not  limit or confine ourselves exclusively to it, and that other and  long-known marks should be equally regarded.    There are cases, however, where a knowledge and careful examination of  the form and size of the mirror become of the highest importance. It is  well known that certain signs or marks of great milkers are developed,  only as the capacities of the animal herself are fully and completely  developed by age. The milk-veins, for instance, are never so large and  prominent in heifers and young cows as in old ones, and the same may be  said of the udder, and of the veins of the udder and perineum; all of  which it is of great importance to observe in the selection of milch  cows. Those signs, then, which in cows arrived at maturity are almost  sufficient in themselves to warrant a conclusion as to their merits as  milkers, are, to a great extent, wanting in younger animals, and  altogether in calves, as to which there is often doubt whether they  shall be raised; and here a knowledge of the form of the mirror is of  immense advantage, since it gives, at the outset and before any expense  is incurred, a somewhat reliable means of judging of the future milking  capacities of the animal; or, if a male, of the probability of his  transmitting milking qualities to his offspring.    [Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [L.]]    It will be seen, from an examination of the points of a good milch cow  that, though the same marks which indicate the greatest milking  qualities may not always indicate the greatest aptitude to fatten, yet  that the signs which denote good fattening qualities are included among  the signs favorable to the production of milk; such as soundness of  constitution, marked by good organs of digestion and respiration  fineness and mellowness of the skin and hair,"]]]
