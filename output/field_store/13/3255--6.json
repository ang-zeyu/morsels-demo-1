You do  not quarrel with a rose-tree because it cannot sing!\"            A TRUE BAHA'I      A student of the modern methods of the higher criticism asked 'Abdu'l-Baha  if he would do well to continue in the church with which he had been  associated all his life, and whose language was full of meaning to him.  'Abdu'l-Baha answered: \"You must not dissociate yourself from it. Know  this; the Kingdom of God is not in any Society; some seekers go through  many Societies as a traveller goes through many cities till he reach his  destination. If you belong to a Society already do not forsake your  brothers. You can be a Baha'i-Christian, a Baha'i-Freemason, a Baha'i-Jew,  a Baha'i-Muhammadan. The number nine contains eight, and seven, and all  the other numbers, and does not deny any of them. Do not distress or deny  anyone by saying 'He is not a Baha'i!' He will be known by his deeds.  There are no secrets among Baha'is; a Baha'i does not hide anything.\"            SPREADING THE TEACHING      When asked by an American friend: \"Which is the best way to spread the  teaching?\" he said: \"By deeds. This way is open to all, and deeds are  understood by all. Join yourselves to those who work for the poor, the  weak and the unfortunate; this is greatly to be commended. To teach by  words requires the skill of a wise physician. He does not offer help to  those who do not want treatment. Do not press help on those who do not  need your help. The work of teaching is not for all.\"    The following incident shows how 'Abdu'l-Baha's attention is given to the  smallest details where others are involved. On hearing that some of his  friends had come down from London, and had planned to stop the night in  the village so as to be near him 'Abdu'l-Baha immediately made them his  guests at the Inn, and being concerned for their comfort, went over  personally to inspect the rooms, as the nights were getting cold.            AT BROOKLANDS      The morning of the second day, a neighbour sent over her car asking if  'Abdu'l-Baha would not like to take his guests to the Brooklands aviation  ground. Though it was windy, an aviator was on the track, when he heard  who the visitor was offered to fly for him. 'Abdu'l-Baha left his friends  and walked out into the middle of the course, where he stood alone  watching the biplane making wide circles above him.    A Hindu who was learning to fly at the school joined 'Abdu'l-Baha's  friends and asked: \"Who is the man in Eastern dress?\"    When told, he exclaimed, \"Oh I know him very well through his teachings,  which I have studied,\" and immediately he went to meet 'Abdu'l-Baha.    They talked together for some time in Arabic, the young man showing great  joy at being in his presence. He afterwards said that for many years he  had longed for this moment.    While having tea out of doors, 'Abdu'l-Baha and the young Hindu, sitting  at the head of the long benches that has been arranged, talked merrily to  everyone.    'Abdu'l-Baha noticed two of the airmen who were wrestling on the grounds,  and when they stopped, he went to them clapping his hands and crying in  English, \"Bravo! Bravo! that is good exercise.\"    Since his return to Egypt, 'Abdu'l-Baha has sent a kind message of  remembrance to the people of Byfleet, saying that he will never forget  them.            DAYS IN LONDON      During 'Abdu'l-Baha's stay in Cadogan Gardens people arrived all day and  every day, from early morning to nightfall, hoping for the privilege of  seeing him and of hearing him talk. Many were the gatherings round the  board of that hospitable house and hundreds of people were made welcome.  Many came without introduction and no one was refused. Among them were  clergy of various denominations, members of Parliament, magistrates, and  literary men.    The visitors were not only English; numerous Persians had journeyed from  Tihran and other Eastern cities to meet freely one who had so long been  withheld from them by his captivity.    The editor of a journal printed in Japan, altered his return route to  Tokyo in order that he might spend the night near 'Abdu'l-Baha, and a late  visit was paid by a Zoroastrian physician of Bombay, on the eve of his  return to India.            WOMAN'S WORK      'Abdu'l-Baha's interest in women's work and progress is well known, and  among the notable leaders who came to see him, may be mentioned Mrs. Annie  Besant, President of the Theosophical Society, the organizers of various  suffrage bodies, civic and philanthropic workers, the principals of  several woman's colleges and lady doctors.    A spirited conversation due to the visit of an ardent suffragist will be  long remembered by those who had the privilege of being present. The room  was full of men and women, many Persians being seated in their familiar  respectful attitude on the floor.    After contrasting the general position of the Eastern and the Western  women, and then describing how in many respects the Eastern woman has the  advantage of her Western sister, 'Abdu'l-Baha turned and said to the  visitor: \"Give me your reasons for believing that woman today should have  the vote?\"    Answer: \"I believe that humanity is a divine humanity and that it must  rise higher and higher; but it cannot soar with only one wing.\"  'Abdu'l-Baha expressed his pleasure at this answer, and smiling, replied:  \"But what will you do if one wing is stronger than the other?\" Answer:  \"Then we must strengthen the weaker wing, otherwise the flight will always  be hampered.\"    'Abdu'l-Baha smiled and asked: \"What will you say if I prove to you that  the woman is the stronger wing?\"    The answer came in the same bright vein: \"You will earn my eternal  gratitude!\" at which all the company made merry.    'Abdu'l-Baha then continued more seriously: \"The woman is indeed of the  greater importance to the race. She has the greater burden and the greater  work. Look at the vegetable and the animal worlds. The palm which carries  the fruit is the tree most prized by the date grower. The Arab knows that  for a long journey the mare has the longest wind. For her greater strength  and fierceness, the lioness is more feared by the hunter than the lion.    \"The mere size of the brain has been proved to be no measure of  superiority. The woman has greater moral courage than the man; she has  also special gifts which enable her to govern in moments of danger and  crisis. If necessary she can become a warrior.\"            ZENOBIA      'Abdu'l-Baha asked the company if they remembered the story of Zenobia and  of the fall of Palmyra. He then continued as follows, using his hands in  the grave and simple gesticulations characteristic of him:    \"There was once a Governor in Ancient Syria, who had a beautiful and  clever wife. She was so capable that when the Governor died, she was made  ruler in his stead. The land prospered under her sway, and men  acknowledged that she was a better ruler than her husband. After a time  the legions of Rome invaded the country, but again and again she drove  them out with great confusion. She let down her beautiful hair, and  herself rode at the head of her army, clad in a scarlet cloak, wearing a  crown of gold, and wielding a two-edged sword in her hand. The Roman  Caesar then withdrew his strength from five other provinces in order to  subdue her. After a long and brave fight Zenobia retired into the city of  Palmyra, which she strengthened with wonderful fortifications, and there  she endured a siege of four months, Caesar being unable to dislodge her.  The food she had stored within the walls at last was gone, and the misery  of her starving and plague-stricken people compelled her to surrender.    \"Caesar was full of admiration for this great woman, because of her  courage and endurance, and he asked her to become his wife. But she  refused, saying that she would never consent to take as her husband the  enemy of her people. Thereupon, Caesar was enraged, and determined to  humble her. He took her back with him in his ships to Rome. For his  triumphal entry a great procession was prepared, and the streets were  filled with people. In the procession came first elephants, after the  elephants came the camels, after the camels came the tigers and the  leopards, after the leopards came the monkeys, and lastly, after the  monkeys, walked Zenobia with a gold chain round her neck. Still she  carried her head high, and was firm in her determination. Nothing could  break her spirit! She refused to become the Empress of Caesar, so she was  thrown into a dungeon, and eventually she died.\"    'Abdu'l-Baha ceased. Silence fell upon the room, and it was some time  before it was broken.    Upon another occasion 'Abdu'l-Baha said to a group of friends around him:  \"Taken in general, women today have a stronger sense of religion than men.  The woman's intuition is more correct; she is more receptive and her  intelligence is quicker. The day is coming when woman will claim her  superiority to man.    \"Woman has everywhere been commended for her faithfulness. After the Lord  Christ suffered, the disciples wept, and gave way to their grief. They  thought that their hopes were shattered, and that the Cause was utterly  lost, till Mary Magdalene came to them and strengthened them saying: 'Do  you mourn the body of Our Lord or His Spirit? If you mourn His Spirit, you  are mistaken, for Jesus lives! His Spirit will never leave us!' Thus  through her wisdom and encouragement the Cause of Christ was upheld for  all the days to come. Her intuition enabled her to grasp the spiritual  fact.\"    'Abdu'l-Baha then added: \"But in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19251"],[0,"Arohanui: Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand (#11)"],[1,"the jurisdiction of an independent National  Assembly.

Dear Baha'i Brother:    ...He was very happy to see that Mrs Dunn was able to attend the New  Zealand Baha'i Summer School. For a woman of her age, this was surely a  remarkable achievement, and must have been a great inspiration to the New  Zealand friends, coming as she did so freshly from the last  Intercontinental Teaching Conference held in New Delhi....    He attaches great importance to teaching the aboriginal Australians, and  also in converting more Maoris to the Faith, and hopes that the Baha'is  will devote some attention to contacting both of these minority groups....    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear and valued co-workers:_    _...The multiplication of Baha'i isolated centres, groups and local  assemblies, in both Australia and New Zealand--a process that has been  steadily and rapidly developing since the inauguration of the Ten-Year  Plan, is likewise of paramount importance in the years immediately ahead.  The development of these institutions, particularly in New Zealand, will  no doubt hasten the emergence of an independent National Spiritual  Assembly in that territory, and will lend a tremendous impetus to the  onward march of the Faith in those regions...._    _The purchase of a building in Auckland destined to serve as the National  Haziratu'l-Quds of the Baha'is of New Zealand, is yet another objective on  which attention should be immediately focused--in anticipation of the  erection of yet another pillar of the future House of Justice in that  remote part of the world...._    (Extract, ibid., pp. 118, 119, 121, 122)          (61) July 24, 1955      Secretary, National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia and New  Zealand    Dear Baha'i Brother:    ...The news of the purchase of the Haziratu'l-Quds in Auckland was most  welcome. The acquisition of this building is really one of the  pre-requisites for the formation of the National Assembly of New Zealand;  he hopes that the impetus this has given to the work of the Faith there,  combined with the devotion of the Baha'is will speed the formation of  local Assemblies, which alone constitute the necessary firm foundation for  the National Body, a Body which will be one of the direct pillars  supporting the International House of Justice. He urges, therefore, your  Assembly to give all the teaching help it can to New Zealand; and to  encourage the believers there to do their utmost to achieve their  goals....    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear and valued co-workers:_    _...The purchase of the Haziratu'l-Quds in Auckland, as the future  headquarters of the New Zealand National Spiritual Assembly, is another  accomplishment that merits the highest praise...._    _...The establishment of Baha'i endowments in the Dominion of New Zealand  is yet another responsibility devolving upon their elected national  representatives, a responsibility which should be discharged prior to the  emergence of an independent national assembly in that distant and  promising island._    _Whilst these immediate goals are being steadily and resolutely pursued,  attention should, likewise, be particularly directed to the vital need for  the constant multiplication of isolated centres, groups and local  assemblies, as well as to the necessity of increasing, to an unprecedented  degree, the number of the avowed adherents of the Faith who can directly  and effectively contribute to the broadening of its foundations and the  expansion of its nascent institutions. Particularly in the Dominion of New  Zealand, where a pillar of the future Universal House of Justice will soon  be erected, must a fresh impetus be lent to this vital process which can  alone reinforce the foundations on which this projected institution must  ultimately rest...._    (Extract, ibid., pp. 123, 125, 126, 127)          (62) June 13th, 1956      Secretary, National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia and New  Zealand.    Dear Baha'i Brother:    ...As regards the question the Auckland Assembly has asked about  vivisection, there is nothing on this subject in the Baha'i teachings. At  a future date such matters will no doubt be taken up by the International  House of Justice....    He is delighted to hear that the New Zealand friends are so eagerly  carrying on their work in preparation for their National Assembly next  year. Their coming of age, so to speak, will be a source of pride to all  their fellow National Assemblies, and they will form a welcome addition to  the pillars which must ultimately sustain the International House of  Justice....    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear and valued co-workers:_    _...Particular attention should be devoted to the urgent needs of the New  Zealand Baha'i community, through the formulation of a plan which will  enable it to swell the number of its administrative institutions,  enlarging and reinforcing thereby the foundations on which its forthcoming  National Assembly must ultimately rest...._    (Extract, ibid., pp. 130, 131, 133)          (63) September 5th, 1956      Secretary, Regional Teaching Committee for New Zealand.    Dear Baha'i Brother:    Your letter of August 3rd with enclosure has been received by the beloved  Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.    He was happy to see this report of the activities of the Baha'is in New  Zealand, and will be pleased to receive a copy of your News Letter  regularly.    The Guardian wishes your Committee and the believers there to know that he  has high hopes for their future achievements in that far-off land, where  they are now on the threshold of that historic event, the election of  their own National Spiritual Assembly. He deeply values their devotion,  and the eager and fervent character of their services.    With warm Baha'i greetings,  R. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _Assuring you of my loving prayers for your success and spiritual  advancement,_    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (64) April 4th, 1957      Message from the Guardian at the inception of the New Zealand National  Spiritual Assembly.    I share with the assembled delegates, gathered to elect, on this historic  occasion, the second National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the  Antipodes, the feelings of profound satisfaction and gratitude to  Baha'u'llah evoked by this epoch-making event in the evolution of His  Faith in that far off region of the globe. I am deeply conscious of the  decisive share which the Australian Baha'i Community, labouring during  more than three decades, for the spread of the light of this glorious  revelation among the highly progressive people of that distant continent,  has had in the laying of the foundations of the Administrative Order and  the erection of yet another pillar of the future Universal House of  Justice in this remote Dominion.    The emergence of this independent Baha'i Community, no matter how limited  its numerical strength and modest its resources, must be regarded as a  highly significant development in the rise and establishment of the Baha'i  Faith in the Pacific Area, and should synchronise with the formulation, on  the part of the National Spiritual Assembly now being elected in that  Island, of a subsidiary Six-Year-Plan, designed to reinforce substantially  the numerical strength of the Community; to multiply its Centres, as well  as its Local Spiritual Assemblies; to incorporate the solidly grounded  amongst them; to inaugurate a National Fund; to obtain recognition for  both the Baha'i marriage certificate and the Baha'i Holy Days; to lend an  unprecedented impetus to the conversion of the Maoris, and to ensure their  active participation in the conduct of Baha'i Administrative Institutions;  to extend the scope of the work already initiated in the South Island; to  incorporate the newly formed National Spiritual Assembly, and to select  and acquire a site for the first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of that Dominion.    I call upon the members of the Australian National Spiritual Assembly, as  well as the members of the Australian Baha'i Community, to continue to  lend their valued support to this newly pledged sister Community, and to  enable it, through the extension of material assistance as well as the  dispatch of visiting teachers and pioneers, to contribute, in an ever  increasing measure, to the furtherance of the magnificent and colossal  campaign now being so vigorously conducted in the North, in the South, and  in the heart of the Pacific Ocean.    May the outpourings of the Holy Spirit continue to energise this small yet  resolute forward marching, dedicated community, and may the outcome of the  collective efforts of its members contribute decisively to the triumphant  consummation of the World Crusade on which the entire body of the  followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah have so confidently embarked.    Shoghi          (65) May 20th, 1957      Secretary, National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of New Zealand.    Dear Baha'i Friends:    Our beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you on his behalf and  inform you that the Hand of the Cause, Mr Varqa, will shortly be  forwarding to your assembly the equivalent of five hundred English pounds,  as the Guardian's contribution to your newly established National Fund.    He hopes that in the formulation of your plans, particular attention will  be given to the all-important teaching work, the foundation of all the  activities of the Faith and the most urgent task facing the friends in  this critical period the world is"]]]
