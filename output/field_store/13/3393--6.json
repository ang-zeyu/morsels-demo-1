Behind the Hall were a stable and a barn, and also  a garage. And still farther back were a vegetable garden and some farm  fields, for Colonel Colby believed in raising as much stuff for the  Hall table as possible.    \"That's the Rick Rack River,\" explained Spouter, as they passed the  stream. \"We've some dandy times there swimming and boating.\"    \"Don't you have skating in the winter?\" queried Andy.    \"Sure! And we have some great races, too.\"    In another moment the auto-stage drew up to the front door of Colby  Hall, and one after another the boys and Captain Dale and the other  teacher alighted.    \"You new pupils may as well follow me right to the office,\" said the  captain. \"You can leave your suitcases in the hallway until you have  been assigned to your rooms.\"    He led the way, and they followed through a large reception room and  into an elegantly appointed office where Colonel Colby sat at a  mahogany desk, writing.    \"Some new pupils, Colonel Colby,\" announced the captain, and at once  the colonel arose.    \"So you are the Rover boys, eh?\" he said, his face lighting up with  pleasure. \"I am certainly very glad to meet you. Of course you know  that your fathers and myself were schoolmates for many years?\"    \"Yes, Colonel Colby, we know that,\" replied Jack. \"That is one reason  why they sent us here.\"    \"So I understand. I am proud to know that my old friends think so much  of me,\" and the master of Colby Hall smiled broadly. \"I am sure we are  going to get along famously.\"    \"It certainly looks like a nice school,\" remarked Andy, frankly. \"I  like it first rate.\"    \"And so do I,\" added his twin.    \"We hope to have some great times here,\" came from Fred.    Then one after another the boys were required to sign the register and  answer a number of questions regarding their age and previous  instruction, and the state of their health.    \"I'll have Professor Brice assign you to your rooms,\" said Colonel  Colby, after the questioning had come to an end. \"He has charge of that  matter so far as it concerns the older boys. The younger boys are under  the charge of Mrs. Crews, the matron.\"    The master of the Hall touched a bell, and when a servant appeared  requested that Professor Brice be summoned. The latter soon appeared, a  young man evidently just from college. He was introduced to the boys,  and then took them off to assign them their rooms.    \"Hadn't we better get our suitcases?\" suggested Jack.    \"Yes; you might as well bring them along,\" answered Professor Paul  Brice. \"That will save another trip downstairs. You can give your trunk  checks to me, and I will see that the trunks are brought up from the  station and placed in your rooms to be unpacked. After you've unpacked  them, they will be marked with your names and placed in the trunk  room.\"    It took the boys but a minute to reach the end of the hallway where  their suitcases had been left. Those of the twins were still there, and  also that belonging to Jack; but Fred's was missing.    \"Hello! what's become of my suitcase?\" questioned the youngest Rover,  anxiously.    \"Maybe somebody carried it upstairs for you,\" suggested Jack.    All looked around the hallway and in the nearby rooms, but the suitcase  could not be found.    \"Well, I don't think you need to worry,\" said Professor Brice lightly.  \"There is no danger of thieves around here. Probably some boy picked up  the suitcase by mistake.\"    \"Maybe,\" returned Fred; but then he looked at his cousins and shook his  head slowly.    \"I guess you suspect Nappy Martell and his cronies,\" whispered Randy on  the way upstairs.    \"I do!\" answered Fred. \"I think they took that suitcase to play a trick  on me.\"          CHAPTER IX    THE MISSING SUITCASE      In the letters sent to Colby Hall the Rover boys had requested that  they be placed in rooms close to those occupied by Spouter Powell, Gif  Garrison and their chums, and Colonel Colby had replied that he would  do what he could for them in the matter, although many of the choicest  rooms at the Hall had already been assigned to the old cadets.    \"I can give you a choice of several rooms,\" said Professor Brice, as he  led the way to the second floor of the school. \"Come this way, please.\"    He took them down a long corridor and into a wing of the building.    \"This is our hallway,\" whispered Spouter to Jack. \"I guess you'll get  pretty close to Gif and me after all.\"    Spouter and Gif had rooms numbered 19 and 21. Across the hall, Fatty  had number 16. 18, 20 and 22 were as yet unassigned.    \"I can give you these three rooms,\" announced Paul Brice.    \"But what about the fourth?\" queried Jack. \"There are four of us, you  see, and all these are single rooms.\"    \"For a fourth room you might take the one next to that occupied by  Powell on the other side of the hallway,\" answered the teacher.    \"That might do,\" returned Fred. \"But we would prefer to be  together--especially as these rooms all connect.\"    \"I think I can help you out if you want me to,\" came from Fatty,  good-naturedly. \"If Professor Brice is willing, I'll move over to  number twenty-three, and that will give you four fellows numbers  sixteen, eighteen, twenty, and twenty-two.\"    \"Oh, we don't want to disturb you, although it's very kind of you to  make the offer,\" remonstrated Jack.    \"That's all right,\" answered Fatty. \"I'd just as lief be next to  Spouter. The room is just as good, and I know you four cousins would  like to keep together.\" And so, after a little more talk, the matter  was arranged.    \"Now the question is: How are we going to assign these rooms?\" came  from Randy.    \"I've got an idea,\" returned his twin.    \"All right; out with it!\" came from Fred. \"I'd like to get settled so  that I can make another hunt for my missing suitcase.\"    \"Why not live here just as we live on Riverside Drive?\" answered Andy.  \"Jack can take one of the middle rooms, with Fred on one side of him  and Randy and myself on the other.\"    \"You've solved it, Andy!\" exclaimed Jack, and so without further ado  the matter was settled.    \"Now I'll institute a hunt for that missing suitcase,\" said Professor  Brice after he had made a note of the room assignments. \"Most likely  some boy picked it up by mistake.\"    \"If he did that, why didn't he leave his own suitcase behind?\" queried  Fred.    \"I'll look it up. Don't worry,\" said the professor, and then hurried  away, for there were many other matters demanding his attention.    The boys found the rooms small but pleasant. Each contained a single  bed, a desk, and a chiffonier, and also a small clothing closet. In one  corner was a bowl with running water, and each room contained two  electric lights. All of the rooms had connecting doors, but these, for  the most part, were kept closed, some of the pupils having their beds  or chiffoniers in front of them.    \"You see, you are permitted to arrange your room to suit yourselves,\"  explained Spouter, \"so some of the boys have them one way and some  another. Some of the boys are even permitted to double up--that is, put  two of the beds in one room and use the other room exclusively for  dressing and studying.\"    \"That's an idea,\" answered Randy. \"Maybe Andy and I will do that.\" This  plan was followed out by the twins, who used the last room of the four  for a sleeping apartment and made of the other room a sort of general  meeting place for all of the Rovers.    \"Where does that Nappy Martell hold forth?\" questioned Fred of Fatty,  while he was helping the stout youth transfer his belongings across the  hallway.    \"He and Slugger Brown and Codfish and that gang are all around the  corner, on the main corridor,\" was the reply. \"That is, Nappy was there  last season. I don't know whether somebody else used his room after he  left or not.\"    \"It was room sixty,\" put in Spouter. \"Slugger has sixty-two. I don't  believe anyone went into sixty after Nappy left. You see, it was almost  the end of the term and all the cadets were settled.\"    \"I'm going to take a look around,\" answered Fred. \"I can't do anything  here anyway, with no suitcase and no trunk.\"    \"I guess I'd better go with you,\" came from Jack. He did not wish to  allow his cousin to interview the big, over-dressed youth alone.    Leaving the others to settle down in the rooms as best they could, Fred  and Jack hurried through the hallway to the main corridor of the second  floor of the Hall. Old cadets and new pupils were coming and going in  all directions, and many were the glances of curiosity directed towards  the Rovers.    \"Gee! some of those fellows certainly look nifty in their uniforms,\"  was Fred's comment.    \"They look like the uniforms our folks brought home from Putnam Hall,\"  answered Jack. \"My father's old uniform is up in our storeroom now. I  tried it on one day just for fun. They tell me they are patterned after  the uniforms worn at West Point.\"    \"There goes an officer,\" whispered Fred, as a tall youth went by with a  sword dangling from his belt. \"Look at the gold braid, will you? Isn't  it swell?\" he added, in deep admiration.    \"I can see your finish, Fred,\" laughed his cousin. \"If you stay here,  you'll want to be an officer with a sword, and with lots of gold lace.\"    \"I don't know about that,\" answered the youngest Rover, seriously. \"I  guess all the officers have to be big boys.\"    \"Nonsense! Size has nothing to do with it. Why, some of the greatest  military men in the world have been very small. Look at Napoleon, for  instance.\"    \"Well, I'll see about that later, Jack. Just now I'd rather get on the  track of that suitcase.\"    It did not take the two Rovers long to reach that part of the corridor  where was located the room formerly occupied by Nappy Martell. The door  was open"]]]
