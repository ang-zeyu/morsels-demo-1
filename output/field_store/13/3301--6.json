And this is the point now in question.      72. Observe, there are two great reciprocal duties concerning industry,  constantly to be exchanged between the living and the dead. We, as we  live and work, are to be always thinking of those who are to come after  us; that what we do may be serviceable, as far as we can make it so, to  them, as well as to us. Then, when we die, it is the duty of those who  come after us to accept this work of ours with thanks and remembrance,  not thrusting it aside or tearing it down the moment they think they  have no use for it. And each generation will only be happy or powerful  to the pitch that it ought to be, in fulfilling these two duties to the  Past and the Future. Its own work will never be rightly done, even for  itself--never good, or noble, or pleasurable to its own eyes--if it does  not prepare it also for the eyes of generations yet to come. And its own  possessions will never be enough for it, and its own wisdom never enough  for it, unless it avails itself gratefully and tenderly of the treasures  and the wisdom bequeathed to it by its ancestors.      73. For, be assured, that all the best things and treasures of this  world are not to be produced by each generation for itself; but we are  all intended, not to carve our work in snow that will melt, but each and  all of us to be continually rolling a great white gathering snowball,  higher and higher--larger and larger--along the Alps of human power.  Thus the science of nations is to be accumulative from father to son:  each learning a little more and a little more; each receiving all that  was known, and adding its own gain: the history and poetry of nations  are to be accumulative; each generation treasuring the history and the  songs of its ancestors, adding its own history and its own songs: and  the art of nations is to be accumulative, just as science and history  are; the work of living men is not superseding, but building itself  upon the work of the past. Nearly every great and intellectual race of  the world has produced, at every period of its career, an art with some  peculiar and precious character about it, wholly unattainable by any  other race, and at any other time; and the intention of Providence  concerning that art, is evidently that it should all grow together into  one mighty temple; the rough stones and the smooth all finding their  place, and rising, day by day, in richer and higher pinnacles to heaven.      74. Now, just fancy what a position the world, considered as one great  workroom--one great factory in the form of a globe--would have been in  by this time, if it had in the least understood this duty, or been  capable of it. Fancy what we should have had around us now, if, instead  of quarrelling and fighting over their work, the nations had aided each  other in their work, or if even in their conquests, instead of effacing  the memorials of those they succeeded and subdued, they had guarded the  spoils of their victories. Fancy what Europe would be now, if the  delicate statues and temples of the Greeks--if the broad roads and  massy walls of the Romans--if the noble and pathetic architecture of the  middle ages, had not been ground to dust by mere human rage. You talk of  the scythe of Time, and the tooth of Time: I tell you, Time is  scytheless and toothless; it is we who gnaw like the worm--we who smite  like the scythe. It is ourselves who abolish--ourselves who consume: we  are the mildew, and the flame; and the soul of man is to its own work as  the moth that frets when it cannot fly, and as the hidden flame that  blasts where it cannot illuminate. All these lost treasures of human  intellect have been wholly destroyed by human industry of destruction;  the marble would have stood its two thousand years as well in the  polished statue as in the Parian cliff; but we men have ground it to  powder, and mixed it with our own ashes. The walls and the ways would  have stood--it is we who have left not one stone upon another, and  restored its pathlessness to the desert; the great cathedrals of old  religion would have stood--it is we who have dashed down the carved work  with axes and hammers, and bid the mountain-grass bloom upon the  pavement, and the sea-winds chant in the galleries.      75. You will perhaps think all this was somehow necessary for the  development of the human race. I cannot stay now to dispute that, though  I would willingly; but do you think it is _still_ necessary for that  development? Do you think that in this nineteenth century it is still  necessary for the European nations to turn all the places where their  principal art-treasures are into battle-fields? For that is what they  are doing even while I speak; the great firm of the world is managing  its business at this moment, just as it has done in past time. Imagine  what would be the thriving circumstances of a manufacturer of some  delicate produce--suppose glass, or china--in whose workshop and  exhibition rooms all the workmen and clerks began fighting at least once  a day, first blowing off the steam, and breaking all the machinery they  could reach; and then making fortresses of all the cupboards, and  attacking and defending the show-tables, the victorious party finally  throwing everything they could get hold of out of the window, by way of  showing their triumph, and the poor manufacturer picking up and putting  away at last a cup here and a handle there. A fine prosperous business  that would be, would it not? and yet that is precisely the way the great  manufacturing firm of the world carries on its business.      76. It has so arranged its political squabbles for the last six or seven  hundred years, that not one of them could be fought out but in the midst  of its most precious art; and it so arranges them to this day. For  example, if I were asked to lay my finger, in a map of the world, on the  spot of the world's surface which contained at this moment the most  singular concentration of art-teaching and art-treasure, I should lay it  on the name of the town of Verona. Other cities, indeed, contain more  works of carriageable art, but none contain so much of the glorious  local art, and of the springs and sources of art, which can by no means  be made subjects of package or porterage, nor, I grieve to say, of  salvage. Verona possesses, in the first place, not the largest, but the  most perfect and intelligible Roman amphitheatre that exists, still  unbroken in circle of step, and strong in succession of vault and arch:  it contains minor Roman monuments, gateways, theatres, baths, wrecks of  temples, which give the streets of its suburbs a character of antiquity  unexampled elsewhere, except in Rome itself. But it contains, in the  next place, what Rome does not contain--perfect examples of the great  twelfth-century Lombardic architecture, which was the root of all the  mediaeval art of Italy, without which no Giottos, no Angelicos, no  Raphaels would have been possible: it contains that architecture, not in  rude forms, but in the most perfect and loveliest types it ever  attained--contains those, not in ruins, nor in altered and hardly  decipherable fragments, but in churches perfect from porch to apse, with  all their carving fresh, their pillars firm, their joints unloosened.  Besides these, it includes examples of the great thirteenth and  fourteenth-century Gothic of Italy, not merely perfect, but elsewhere  unrivalled. At Rome, the Roman--at Pisa, the Lombard--architecture may  be seen in greater or in equal nobleness; but not at Rome, nor Pisa, nor  Florence, nor in any city of the world, is there a great mediaeval Gothic  like the Gothic of Verona. Elsewhere, it is either less pure in type or  less lovely in completion: only at Verona may you see it in the  simplicity of its youthful power, and the tenderness of its accomplished  beauty. And Verona possesses, in the last place, the loveliest  Renaissance architecture of Italy, not disturbed by pride, nor defiled  by luxury, but rising in fair fulfilment of domestic service, serenity  of effortless grace, and modesty of home seclusion; its richest work  given to the windows that open on the narrowest streets and most silent  gardens. All this she possesses, in the midst of natural scenery such as  assuredly exists nowhere else in the habitable globe--a wild Alpine  river foaming at her feet, from whose shore the rocks rise in a great  crescent, dark with cypress, and misty with olive: illimitably, from  before her southern gates, the tufted plains of Italy sweep and fade in  golden light; around her, north and west, the Alps crowd in crested  troops, and the winds of Benacus bear to her the coolness of their  snows.      77. And this is the city--such, and possessing such things as these--at  whose gates the decisive battles of Italy are fought continually: three  days her towers trembled with the echo of the cannon of Arcola; heaped  pebbles of the Mincio divide her fields to this hour with lines of  broken rampart, whence the tide of war rolled back to Novara; and now on  that crescent of her eastern cliffs, whence the full moon used to rise  through the bars of the cypresses in her burning summer twilights,  touching with soft increase of silver light the rosy marbles of her  balconies,--along the ridge of that encompassing rock, other circles are  increasing now, white and pale; walled towers of cruel strength,  sable-spotted with cannon-courses. I tell you, I have seen, when the  thunderclouds came down on those Italian hills, and all their crags were  dipped in the dark, terrible purple, as if the winepress of the wrath of  God had stained their mountain-raiment--I have seen the hail fall in  Italy till the forest branches stood"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19998"],[0,"Rural Architecture (#11)"],[1,"them,  conducted by the chamber ceiling overhead. This heat can best be  obviated by inserting a small window at each opposite peak of the  garret, by which the outside air can circulate through, above the  chambers, and so pass off the heated air, which will continually ascend.  All this is a simple matter, for which any builder can provide, without  particular expense or trouble.          INTERIOR ACCOMMODATION OF HOUSES.      Ground, in the country, being the cheapest item which the farmer can  devote to building purposes, his object should be to _spread over_,  rather than to go deeply into it, or climb high in the air above it.  We repudiate cellar kitchens, or under-ground rooms for house work,  altogether, as being little better than a nuisance--dark, damp,  unhealthy, inconvenient, and expensive. The several rooms of a farm  dwelling house should be compact in arrangement, and contiguous as may  be to the principally-occupied apartments. Such arrangement is cheaper,  more convenient, and labor-saving; and in addition, more in accordance  with a good and correct taste in the outward appearance of the house  itself.    The general introduction of cooking stoves, and other stoves and  apparatus for warming houses, within the last twenty years, which we  acknowledge to be a great acquisition in comfort as well as in  convenience and economy, has been carried to an extreme, not only in  shutting up and shutting out the time-honored open fireplace and its  broad hearthstone, with their hallowed associations, but also in  prejudice to the health of those who so indiscriminately use them,  regardless of other arrangements which ought to go with them. A farm  house should never be built without an ample, open fireplace in its  kitchen, and other _principally_ occupied rooms; and in all rooms where  stoves are placed, and fires are daily required, the _open_ Franklin  should take place of the close or air-tight stove, unless extraordinary  ventilation to such rooms be adopted also. The great charm of the  farmer's winter evening is the open fireside, with its cheerful blaze  and glowing embers; not wastefully expended, but giving out that genial  warmth and comfort which, to those who are accustomed to its enjoyment,  is a pleasure not made up by any invention whatever; and although the  cooking stove or range be required--which, in addition to the fireplace,  we would always recommend, to lighten female labor--it can be so  arranged as not to interfere with the enjoyment or convenience of the  open fire.    In the construction of the chimneys which appear in the plans submitted,  the great majority of them--particularly those for northern  latitudes--are placed in the interior of the house. They are less liable  to communicate fire to the building, and assist greatly in warming the  rooms through which they pass. In southern houses they are not so  necessary, fires being required for a much less period of the year. Yet  even there they may be oftentimes properly so placed. Where holes, for  the passage of stovepipes through floors, partitions, or into chimneys,  are made, stone, earthen, or iron thimbles should be inserted; and,  except in the chimneys, such holes should be at least one to two inches  larger than the pipe itself. The main flues of the chimney conducting  off the smoke of the different fires, should be built separate, and kept  apart by a partition of one brick in thickness, and carried out  independently, as in no other way will they rid the house of smoky  rooms.      [Illustration]    An illustration in point: Fifteen years ago we purchased and removed  into a most substantial and well-built stone house, the chimneys of  which were constructed with open fireplaces, and the flues carried up  separately to the top, where they all met upon the same level surface,  as chimneys in past times usually were built, thus. Every fireplace in  the house (and some of them had stoves in,) smoked intolerably; so much  so, that when the wind was in some quarters the fires had to be put out  in every room but the kitchen, which, as good luck would have it, smoked  less--although it did smoke there--than the others. After balancing the  matter in our own mind some time, whether we should pull down and  rebuild the chimneys altogether, or attempt an alteration; as we had  given but little thought to the subject of chimney draft, and to try an  experiment was the cheapest, we set to work a bricklayer, who, under our  direction, simply built over each discharge of the several flues a  separate top of fifteen inches high, in this wise: The remedy was  perfect. We have had no smoke in the house since, blow the wind as it  may, on any and all occasions. The chimneys _can't_ smoke; and the whole  expense for four chimneys, with their twelve flues, was not twenty  dollars! The remedy was in giving each outlet a _distinct_ current of  air all around, and on every side of it.      [Illustration]          CHIMNEY TOPS.      Nothing adds more to the outward expression of a dwelling, than the  style of its chimneys. We have just shown that independent chimney tops  pass off their smoke more perfectly, than when only partitioned inside  to the common point of outlet. Aside from the architectural beauty which  a group of chimney flues adds to the building, we have seen that they  are really useful, beyond the formal, square-sided piles so common  throughout the country. They denote good cheer, social firesides, and a  generous hospitality within--features which should always mark the  country dwelling; and more particularly that of the farmer.    The style and arrangement of these chimney groups may be various, as  comporting with the design of the house itself; and any good architect  can arrange them as fitted to such design. Our illustrations will show  them of different kinds, which are generally cheap in construction, and  simple, yet expressive in their arrangement.          PRELIMINARY TO OUR DESIGNS.      We have discussed with tolerable fullness, the chief subjects connected  with farm buildings--sufficiently so, we trust, to make ourselves  understood as desiring to combine utility with commendable ornament in  all that pertains to them. The object has been, thus far, to give hints,  rather than models, in description. But as the point to which we have  endeavored to arrive will be but imperfectly understood without  illustration, we shall submit a few plans of houses and outbuildings,  as carrying out more fully our ideas.    We are quite aware that different forms or fashions of detail and  finish, to both outside and inside work, prevail among builders in  different sections of the United States. Some of these fashions are the  result of climate, some of conventional taste, and some of education.  With them we are not disposed to quarrel. In many cases they are  immaterial to the main objects of the work, and so long as they please  the taste or partialities of those adopting them, are of little  consequence. There are, however, certain matters of _principle_, both in  general construction and in the detail of finish, which should not be  disregarded; and these, in the designs submitted, and in the  explanations which follow, will be fully discussed, each in its place.  The particular form or style of work we have not directed, because, as  before remarked, we are no professional builder, and of course free from  the dogmas which are too apt to be inculcated in the professional  schools and workshops. We give a wide berth, and a free toleration in  all such matters, and are not disposed to raise a hornet's nest about  our ears by interfering in matters where every tyro of the drafting  board and work-bench assumes to be, and probably may be, our superior.  All minor subjects we are free to leave to the skill and ingenuity of  the builder--who, fortunately for the country, is found in almost every  village and hamlet of the land.    Modes and styles of finish, both inside and outside of buildings,  change; and that so frequently, that what is laid down as the reigning  fashion to-day, may be superseded by another fashion of  to-morrow--immaterial in themselves, only, and not affecting the shape,  arrangement, and accommodation of the building itself, which in these,  must ever maintain their relation with the use for which it is intended.  The northern dwelling, with its dependencies and appointments, requires  a more compact, snug, and connected arrangement than that of the south;  while one in the middle states may assume a style of arrangement between  them both, each fitted for their own climate and country, and in equally  good taste. The designs we are about to submit are intended to be such  as may be modified to any section of the country, although some of them  are made for extremes of north and south, and are so distinguished.  Another object we have had in view is, to give to every farmer and  country dweller of moderate means the opportunity of possessing a cheap  work which would guide him in the general objects which he wishes to  accomplish in building, that he may _have his own notions_ on the  subject, and not be subject to the caprice and government of such as  profess to exclusive knowledge in all that appertains to such subjects,  and in which, it need not be offensive to say, that although clever in  their way, they are sometimes apt to be mistaken.    Therefore, without assuming _to instruct_ the professional builder, our  plans will be submitted, not without the hope that he even, may find in  them something worthy of consideration; and we offer them to the owner  and future occupant of the buildings themselves, as models which he may  adopt, with the confidence that they will answer all his reasonable  purposes.          DESIGN I.      We here present a farm house of the simplest and most unpretending kind,  suitable for a farm of twenty, fifty, or an hundred acres. Buildings"]]]
