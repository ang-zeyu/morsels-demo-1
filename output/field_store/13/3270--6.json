In 1305 is  an order of Bytton's that chantry services should be held here for  Andrew de Kilkenny, late dean, and others. Among the names we find that  of Henry de Kilkenny, who was at the time of Bytton's order still  living, and a canon of the cathedral.    [Illustration: ST. GEORGE'S CHAPEL (OR SPEKE'S CHANTRY).                 DRAWN BY H.P. CLIFFORD.]    #The Ambulatory.#--Between the high altar and the Lady Chapel is the  ambulatory. It is noticeable that the shafts differ from those in other  parts of the building. The north and south windows are of the time of  Bishop Bruere (thirteenth century). The architecture throughout the  retrochoir is Early Decorated.    Two old oak bible-boxes are attached, one to each pillar: though ugly  and clumsy they are distinctly interesting.    The windows are modern and excellent. Messrs. Clayton and Bell have  seldom done anything better. The colours are quite admirable and well  blended. Two monuments of Jacobean work are well worthy of attention.  Concerning the subject of one, Jacob Railard, there is nothing to be  learnt; but the other, John Bidgood, was \"one of the most accomplished  and beneficial physicians of his age,\" and was born in 1623. He was  deprived of his fellowship at Exeter College in 1648 \"for drinking of  healths to the confusion of Reformers.\" Like many another good man he  had to suffer for his loyalty. He obtained his doctor's degree at Padua  and won a great reputation as a skilful and humane practitioner. With  the Restoration he obtained his Oxford degree but continued to practise  in his native city. He died in his sixty-eighth year.    At the north end of the ambulatory is #Speke's Chantry#, also called St.  George's Chapel. It is of late, and exceedingly rich, Perpendicular  work. Oliver notices that in 1657 the east window and altar were  destroyed to make a passage \"into the great church of St.  Peter's-in-the-East, partitioned from West Peter's by a brick wall  erected, plastered, and whitened on both sides by Walter Deeble, at the  expense of L150.\" The effigy of Sir John Speke rests in the chapel; the  carving behind the figure is very elaborate. His home was at White  Lackington in Somersetshire, and he was the owner of Brampford Speke  near Exeter. To secure the observance of his and his wife's obit, he  endowed the chapel with the \"lands, tenements, and hereditaments in  Langford, Frehead, and Ashill, in Somersetshire.\"    The north window is to the memory of Archdeacon Bartholomew, and was  placed here in 1865.    [Illustration: THE LADY CHAPEL.                 The Photochrom. Co. Photo.]    At the other end of the ambulatory is #Bishop Oldham's Chantry#,  dedicated to our Saviour. It was richly restored by Bishop Oldham, who  also restored the Speke--or St. George--Chantry immediately opposite. It  is to this bishop we owe the \"delicate and elegant screening which  imparts distance and veiling to all nine chapels and to Prior Sylke's  chantry in the north transept.\" The walls and vaulting are richly  decorated, and the panelling and rebus at the north-east corner contain  a rebus on the bishop's name (oul-dom), being decorated with owls. In  accordance with his object in restoring the chapel, his body was buried  there and his effigy lies in a niche of the south wall. Oldham was a  part founder of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, by whose orders the  chapel was restored some years ago. He settled the arms of the  see--gules, a sword erect in pale argent, pommelled and hilted or,  surmounted with two keys in saltire of the last. He was a native of  Manchester, founded the grammar school there, and held the post of  warden. He was a man of very methodical habits, according to Hoker. He  dined regularly at eleven, and supped at five. \"To ensure precision he  had a house clock to strike the hours and a servant to look after it.  Should his lordship be prevented by important business from coming to  table at the appointed time, the servant would delay the clock's  striking the hour until he knew that his master was ready. Sometimes, if  asked what was the hour, he would humorously answer, 'As your lordship  pleaseth,' at which the bishop would smile and go away.\"    #The Lady Chapel.#--It has been suggested that this chapel occupies the  site of the choir in the old cathedral of Leofric. The earliest mention  of it is in a deed of Bishop Bruere's in 1237. It was remodelled by  Bronscombe and Quivil. But the \"two pointed arches with solid  piers--totally different from any others in the Cathedral--dividing the  Chapel from the side chapels,\" though their moulding has been altered  very considerably in order to tally with a later style, show evidence of  much earlier date. The shafts are of Purbeck marble, and the windows,  arranged as in the nave, contain the last importation of glass from  abroad, save that in the transeptal windows, used in the cathedral. The  bosses in the eastern bay, with the evangelists' emblems and head of  Christ, should be noticed. The elaborate fourteenth century reredos is  the work of Grandisson. The central niche contained a figure of the  Virgin, before which a lamp was suspended. The sedilia and double  piscina on the south side are interesting.    The Lady Chapel contains several monumental tombs of interest. Beneath  the arches conducting to the side chapels are the effigies of Bishops  Bronscombe and Stafford.    Bronscombe died in 1280, Stafford in 1419; but with a regard to  symmetry, which is conspicuous in the cathedral, the earlier effigy of  Bronscombe was raised and provided with a new canopy to correspond with  Stafford's tomb on the opposite side. Bronscombe lies on the south side,  at the entrance to, or the north side of, his chapel of St. Gabriel. The  colouring on the effigy must have been uncommonly splendid, and even the  remnants of the patterns have not faded out of all beauty.    [Illustration: BISHOP BRONSCOMBE'S MONUMENT                 (FROM BRITTON'S 'EXETER,' 1826).]    Stafford's tomb is on the north side at the entrance to the chapel of  St. Mary Magdalen. It has had to contend with severer enemies than old  age, but shockingly as the effigy has suffered, it still preserves  something of its original beauty and stateliness. The attitude is  simple; the gloved hands of the bishop are joined over his breast in an  attitude of prayer. The face is thin and ascetic, its saintly austerity  being rendered more noticeable owing to the rich mitre that crowns the  head. The folds of the robe are managed with a consummate simplicity and  skill. In Leland's \"Itinerary\" the bishop's epitaph is preserved:      \"Hic jacet Edmundus de Stafforde intumulatus,    Quondam profundus legum doctor reputatus,    Verbis facundus, Comitum de stirpe creatus,    Felix et mundus Pater hujus Pontificatus.\"    #Tomb of Sir John and Lady Doddridge.#--Sir John Doddridge came of an  old Devonshire family, for in 1285 one Walter Doddridge and his wife  surrendered to the Dean and Chapter of Exeter a right of entrance into  the close from their house in High Street. Fuller says of him that it  were \"hard to say, whether he was better artist, divine, Cure, or Common  Lawyer, though he fixed on the last for his publick Profession.\" He was  second justice of the King's Bench, and gained great renown as a judge  of stern integrity. Sir John was three times married, the lady whose  effigy is here represented being his third wife, Dorothy, daughter of  Sir Amias Bampfylde. She died in 1615. Sir John, who became a judge of  the King's Bench, lived till 1628. He won the nickname of the \"sleepy  judge,\" for he always closed his eyes in court, the better to keep his  attention fixed on the case. The monument is very elaborate, and if not  beautiful is well worth attention on account of its technical qualities  and the probable accuracy of its representation. The dress of Lady  Dorothy Doddridge exhibits a good example of costume; the skirt  embroidered with pansies and carnations; the ruff and cuffs showing old  Devonshire \"bone lace.\" It was no doubt copied from one of the lady's  actual gowns.    On the south side of the Lady Chapel are two most interesting monuments  of early bishops. That towards the east has been assigned to Bartholomew  Iscanus (1161-84), but in all probability it represents one of his far  earlier predecessors. The sculpture is almost archaic in style, the  mitre low, the face bearded, and the type extraordinarily Byzantine. The  left hand holds the pastoral staff, the point of which impales a winged  dragon, with a sphinx-like head, at his feet. In the angles of the  archway at the tomb are the figures of two angels with censers.    The other tomb is that of Simon de Apulia (d. 1223). It presents a great  contrast to that just described. The great advance made in the art of  sculpture is noticeable in the more human character of the face, which  is clean shaven, and the more skilful management of the hands. The  artist, too, seems to have courted difficulties, for the bishop's robe  and mitre are richly jewelled, and the foliage and animal at his feet,  though conventional, are most elaborately designed.    [Illustration: SCREEN OF ST. GABRIEL'S CHAPEL.]    #Bishop Peter Quivil# (1291).--This tombstone in the centre of the  pavement was restored here in 1820 on the representation of Mr. John  Jones of Franklyn; the cross and letters were re-cut under his  directions. The epitaph is \"Petra tegit Petrum, nihil officiat sibi  tetrum,\" and Westcott in his \"View of Devon\" writes, \"which verse was  written in an ancient character, each letter distant from the other at  least four inches; so that this short verse supplied the whole large  circumference, and cost me some labour in finding out and reading it.\"    Certainly this is one of the most interesting memorials in the  cathedral; indeed, it may be well considered the most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19449"],[0,"The North American Indian, Vol. 1 (#11)"],[1,"are head medicine-men and medicine-men of lesser degree. The man who  becomes influential enough to be considered the head medicine-man of the  tribe is more of a politician than a doctor of diseases, and in important  cases only is he called to treat in a healing ceremony. It requires a  particularly capable Indian to attain the position of head medicine-man,  for to do so he must not only make the people subservient to his will, but  must wrest the leadership from some other and usually older medicine-man  who is himself an influential character. Unfortunately it is apt to be the  most crafty, scheming man who gains such power over his tribesmen.    A case in point was the recent strife between Das Lan and Goshonne. For  some years the latter, an Indian of exceptional ability and withal  apparently an honest man in his treatment of diseases, was the head  medicine-man of the White Mountain Apache. Then it came to pass that the  crafty old Das Lan of the Cibicu had his vision, in which was revealed a  special message brought by Chuganaai Skhin from Kuterastan to the Apache  people. This was the beginning of the present so-called messiah craze.                     [Illustration: Maternity Belt - Apache]                             Maternity Belt - Apache                 _From Copyright Photograph 1907 by E.S. Curtis_      From the first there was promise of a battle to the end between Goshonne  and Das Lan. Goshonne well knew that if the new cult gained a firm footing  he would lose his influence and at best be but a mediocre medicine-man.  Das Lan, on the other hand, knew that he must break the power of such a  man as Goshonne, if he was to assume the leadership. Goshonne scoffed and  scorned, and would have none of the new belief. Still, he was an Indian,  and the prophecies of his rival gradually filled him with superstitious  fear, while his followers were either deserting him openly or were  secretly joining the ranks of the enemy. Death was predicted for the  members of Goshonne's own family, and well could Das Lan make such  prophecies, for Goshonne's two brothers were already stricken with  tuberculosis. First one died, then the other. Das Lan could now point to  him and say, \"That is what Kuterastan does to those who do not believe!\"  It was thus that Goshonne's power finally was broken and Das Lan became a  seer.    Sacred pollen, _hadintin_, is used in all ceremonies, particularly in  those designed for healing. The principal source of _hadintin_ is the  tule, but much of it comes from the pinon. For prayers invoking an  abundance of corn, pollen is mixed with cornmeal. Not only do the  medicine-men use this powder, but each individual carries a small quantity  of it in a deerskin pouch somewhere about his person. In the pollen may be  small medicine trinkets--sometimes consisting of a few shell beads from  prehistoric ruins--and there is scarcely a person, old or young, who does  not have a small section of the candle cactus fastened somewhere about his  clothing.    When childbirth approaches, the medicine-men are always summoned. Nothing  can give a better idea of the medicine rites on such an occasion, and of  the use of sacred pollen, than a description of a maternity belt procured  by the writer and here illustrated. So far as can be learned, this belt is  very old, so old that its painted symbolic figures have been three times  renewed. Belts of this kind are very rare, and are hired whenever their  use is required. The owner of this particular belt, a widow, did not care  to dispose of it; as she expressed it, \"it is like a husband\": the  remuneration from granting its use was sufficient to support her.    The belt is made from skin of the mountain lion, the black-tail deer, the  white-tail deer, and the antelope--animals which give birth to their young  without trouble. Medicine-men are called in to pray to the spirits of  these animals when a woman approaching confinement puts on the belt. It is  worn for a day or so only, but constantly during the critical period, not  being removed until after the child is born. Prayers are made, first by a  mother or father for their daughter, then by a medicine-man, and lastly by  the patient to the gods and elements depicted on the belt. These figures  are all connected with lightning lines. The first one to the left is  Stenatlihan; on the same portion is the Snake Girl, Klishcho Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n; the  next is Naye{~COMBINING BREVE~}nezgani, the third Tubadzischi{~COMBINING BREVE~}ni, and the last Yolkai  Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n. The sharp points around the circular abodes of the two goddesses  represent barricades for protection. At the real homes of these deities,  none can pass through these barriers.    Each of the gods from left to right is prayed to successively, and  _hadintin_ is sprinkled around them afterward. Stenatlihan is the first to  be addressed by the prospective mother:    \"We are your children. When you gave birth to your children, it caused you  no trouble. Make me like yourself, that my child, soon to be born, may  come into this world easily and quickly, without pain to me.\"    Next the Snake Girl is prayed to:    \"Kli{~COMBINING BREVE~}shcho Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n, you came into this life with ease. Do what you can for  me now, that my child may come in like manner.\"    Then to Naye{~COMBINING BREVE~}nezgani:    \"Help my babe, soon to be born, to come as you did--quickly, easily, and  without pain.\"    The belt in Naye{~COMBINING BREVE~}nezgani's left hand represents the one worn by his  mother, Stenatlihan, when he was born. There was a time when skirts, too,  having the same magic power the belt is supposed to possess, were worn by  women at childbirth. One such is shown in the hand of Tubadzischi{~COMBINING BREVE~}ni, next  pictured, to whom the woman addresses a prayer much the same as the last.  The skirt also is the one worn by Stenatlihan when the two brothers were  born.                 [Illustration: Medicine Cap and Fetish - Apache]                         Medicine Cap and Fetish - Apache                 _From Copyright Photograph 1907 by E.S. Curtis_      Yolkai Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n is the favorite goddess from whom, in their belief, the  Apache women are endowed with great beneficence. She lives in the skies,  where all souls go. The prayer to her is, as to the others, \"Save me from  pain and let my child come as you did.\"    Clouds at the feet of Naye{~COMBINING BREVE~}nezgani typify the bounties of the world into  which it is hoped and prayed the child will be happily born.    The prayers finished, _hadintin_ is sifted over all the figures. Beginning  at the left, the lightning line is followed into Stenatlihan's abode,  which is then encircled, and the sacred powder is liberally sprinkled  around and over her body. Each figure is treated in like manner.    The accompanying plate shows a medicine-cap made by Yotlu{~COMBINING BREVE~}ni, a  medicine-man, about forty years ago, to cure a boy of lightning stroke  which had impaired his reason, and a small wooden image of a god recently  made to be carried by a girl troubled with nervousness. On both these  objects the gods and elements which cause afflictions and which alone can  give relief are symbolically represented.    The central figure on the cap pictures Ndidilhkizn, Lightning Maker, with  lightning, _hadilhkih_, in zigzag lines above his head and beneath his  feet. The broad arch indicates clouds with rifts in them, out of which the  evil came and into which it may return. The cross of abalone, the small  white bead, and the eagle feather are media through which Tu Ntelh (Wide  Water), Yolkai Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n (White-Shell Girl), and Itsad Nde{~COMBINING BREVE~}yu (Eagle People)  are supplicated.    The cap was worn at night by the boy, whose parents each morning at  sunrise prayed to the various gods and elements represented on it,  invoking them to take back that which they had left with the boy, and  adding: \"Keep us even in temper and mild and clean in action. We do wrong  at times, but that is not our wish. If our minds are kept clean we will do  nothing bad. We wish to have good thoughts and to do good deeds. Keep our  minds clear that we may think them and do them.\" After each prayer  _hadinin_ was sifted upon the symbol representing the deity addressed.    As the boy soon recovered, the virtue of the cap was attested, and  subsequently its owner often hired it to others.    The little wooden image represents Hadinin Skhin, Pollen Boy, God of  Health. The painted figures on the skin pouch in which it is carried are  similar to those on the cap, and all are supplicated in the same manner.  The medicine-man who made the image and pouch received a horse from the  father of the patient in payment; but not the least interesting feature of  the case for which these objects were made is that the god of the natives  received all the credit for the efficient treatment given the afflicted  girl for a year by the reservation physician.    Dry-paintings, or figures drawn upon the ground with colored earths, were  used in the Apache healing ceremonies, but never to a great extent, and of  late years they have been practically abandoned. These paintings, compared  with the beautiful, conventional productions of the Navaho, are crude; in  making them the Apache always attempt to picture the objects literally  rather than to represent them conventionally or symbolically.    On the infrequent occasions when the dry-paintings are employed, the  medicine-man in charge of the ceremony directs his assistants, at  daylight, to begin the painting. When it is finished he takes his station  close to the easternmost figure of the painting, on its northern side. At  the right of the medicine-man sit twelve chosen singers with a drum. The  four masked _gaun_, or gods, at the same time take their places at the  cardinal points. The patient then enters"]]]
