The \"Portrait of Utenbogardus\" is also excellent; and I may here notice  the large book, which Rembrandt was so fond of introducing, as a means  of a breadth of light and employment for his portraits. Now, to these  circumstances we are indebted for some of the finest works of both  Reynolds and Lawrence: amongst many, I might mention the large ledger in  Lawrence's \"Portraits of the Baring Family,\" and Sir Joshua's picture of  the \"Dilettante Society,\" and others. No doubt we find these means of  making up a picture both in Raffaelle and Titian; but it is rendered  more applicable to our own purposes when it is brought nearer to our own  times, especially when translated by so great a genius as Rembrandt.  The next fine work amongst his etchings is the \"Portrait of Cornelius  Silvius,\" the head of which, being delicately finished with the dry  needle, is seldom seen very fine. This also has a book, and the hand  extended beyond the frame of the oval opening, upon which it casts its  shadow. This practice of representing objects nearer the eye than the  frame is certainly to be observed in some of the prints after Rubens and  others, and has descended to several common prints in our own time, but  ought not to be adopted, as bordering too much upon that art which may  be designated as a sort of _ad captandum vulgus_ display. As we shall  speak more particularly of Rembrandt's portraits when colour is  investigated, these works are merely mentioned as excellent specimens of  composition and chiaro-scuro. I must not omit, however, to notice here  the great Coppenol, the writing-master to the city of Amsterdam: he  holds a pen and a sheet of paper in his hand, and is looking at the  spectator with a look of intelligent observation. The head and figure of  this work were perfected, in the first instance, before the background  was put in, and in this state is exceedingly rare--the one in the  British Museum is valued at five hundred guineas, and was left, amongst  other rare works in his collection, by the Rev. Mr. Cracherode, to the  public. And here we ought to bear in mind, when individuals contribute  so largely by their bequests to the country, it is our bounden duty  to carry out their views by perfecting the various collections as  opportunities offer in the course of time, which to them was impossible.  In one of the impressions in the Museum, in a finished state, is  written, in a large ornamental hand, a commendation by Coppenol himself,  wherein he says he does so to unite his name with that of the great  artist, Rembrandt Van Ryn, as by that means he knows he shall secure  immortality to himself. The portrait, however, that is the most  powerful, as well as the most rare, is Van Tolling the Advocate. The  effect, both from the reflected light on the face, and the fearless  masses of burr, is more like a picture than a print, and renders every  other etching comparatively tame. From the chemical bottles at the side,  and from the character of the gown in which he is dressed, I am of  opinion that he was a physician. The excellence of this work, added to  its rarity, has at all times produced large prices. There are two states  of this print--the first with an irregular beard, the second with the  beard cut square, also some additional work on the drapery, &c.; but,  what is worthy of remark is, in both states it is exceedingly scarce;  in fact, there are but seven impressions known--viz., two in the  British Museum, one in Mr. Holford's collection, one in Mr. Hawkins',  in Amsterdam one, in Paris one, and one in the collection of Mr. Rudge.  I ought here to notice that the Van Tolling is one of the prints  bequeathed to the nation by the Rev. Mr. Cracherode, and that at the  sale of the Hon. Pole Carew's prints, in 1835, this valuable etching  was purchased for the late Baron Verstolke, for two hundred and twenty  pounds.    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF VAN TOLLING]           *       *       *       *       *    I shall now enter upon an investigation of the LANDSCAPES OF REMBRANDT,  which, equally with his portraits, are quite peculiar to himself, but  differing from all others not from any eccentricity of manner, but from  their giving the real essence and character of the scene, when denuded  of any trifling and extraneous matters. Whatever Rembrandt touched was  impressed with the peculiar characteristics of his genius; hence it is  that the smallest stroke in his etchings is pregnant with truth. Though  painting belongs exclusively to no country, but represents the natural  appearance of each, still it is reserved for genius alone to be able to  perceive and place on canvas the essence, as it were, or great leading  features of the subject. I am now more particularly speaking of  landscape scenery. In all countries and climates there are peculiarities  of effect, which, however interesting to the traveller, or a source of  investigation to the philosopher or man of science, yet are necessarily  excluded from the recording pencil of the artist; his appeal is to  mankind at large, not to the isolated few who observe but one side of  the subject. The true artist looks upon nature as the chameleon, capable  of giving out any variety, and yet all equally true; hence it is that  the skies, for example, of Claude, Salvator Rosa, and Gaspar Poussin are  universally subordinate to the general effect of the picture. These men,  living in Italy, were quite aware of the various prismatic effects  observable in sunset, but were also convinced of the necessity of making  the sky subservient, at least conducive to, the breadth and harmony of  the picture. It may be said that Titian and Tintoret embodied the deep  and intense blues of the Venetian atmosphere, but we may remark that  their skies are always held in check by the deep reds and browns of the  draperies of their figures. Let us now, however, turn our remarks more  immediately to Rembrandt, and the scenery and effects observable in  Holland. Any one conversant with the pictures of the Dutch school must  have observed peculiar features in the skies of Backhuysen, Cuyp, and  Rembrandt, arising entirely from the localities of the scenes of their  several pictures. My young friend, E. W. Cooke, long a resident in  Holland, and a keen and observing artist, remarked that the skies in the  pictures of Backhuysen, though dark and inky, were precisely what we see  now--the deep Zuyder Sea swallowing up any refraction of light which  would otherwise have illuminated the clouds; while the skies of Cuyp,  receiving the coruscations arising from the meeting of the two rivers,  the Meuse and the Waal, the scenes of most of his pictures, exhibit  that luminous reflection and unsteady appearance peculiar to his works.  I mention these matters, not to prove that these great observers of  nature followed implicitly what was presented to their observation,  but to show that when even copying the peculiar character of natural  phenomena, it was done with a strict reference to the harmony of their  works, and made subservient to one great broad principle. In a flat  country like Holland, especially where a low horizontal line is chosen,  we perceive a peculiar feature takes precedence of everything else--that  is, the quick diminution of those lines which run to the point of sight,  whilst the lines running parallel with the base line of the picture  retain their length in a greater degree; hence the accumulation of these  lines, such as the division of fields, &c., gradually shade down the  distant parts of the landscape, while the foreshortened lines assume  the appearance of so many spots, or dark touches. In Rembrandt we  perceive this character faithfully rendered, and also, assisted by his  judicious management, the lines, such as the banks of canals or roads,  as they reach the foreground, are strongly pronounced, by either  bringing them in contact with strong light, or giving them breadth and  force by enriching them with broken ground, reeds, or dark herbage. The  objects that stand up, such as trees, &c., are enlarged and darkened  as they approach the eye; thus not only enabling them to keep their  situation, but also to assist the perspective effect in the highest  degree. His small landscape etchings illustrate these remarks, and are  full of the touches of truth and nature; and where objects are wanting  to give variety and interest, he introduces masses of shadow, or dark  clumps of trees, leaving other parts in mere outline. The love of his  art caused him to be always provided with the materials for drawing and  etching, so that we have these transcripts of nature fresh from the  fountain head. We know this from an anecdote mentioned by Daulby. In  describing the etching of \"Six's Bridge,\" in his catalogue, he says,  \"This plate was produced by an incident which deserves to be related.  Rembrandt lived in great intimacy with the Burgomaster Six, and was  frequently at his country seat. One day, when they were there together,  the servant came to acquaint them that dinner was ready, but as they  were sitting down to table, they perceived that mustard was wanting.  The Burgomaster immediately ordered his servant to go into the village  to buy some. Rembrandt, who knew the sluggishness of the Dutch servants,  and when they answer _austons_ (a-coming) they are half an hour before  they appear, offered the Burgomaster a wager that he would etch a plate  before his man returned with the mustard. Six accepted the wager, and  Rembrandt, who had always plates at hand ready varnished, immediately  took one up, and etched upon it the landscape which appeared from the  window of the parlour in which they were sitting. The plate was finished  before the servant returned, and Rembrandt won his wager. The etching is  slight, but it is a wonderful performance, considering the circumstance  that produced it.\" It is not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22693"],[0,"A Book of Myths (#11)"],[1," weary  and chill, wandered away from the place of her happiness, onward and  ever on, until she stood on the bank of a swift-flowing river. For a  little she stayed her steps and listened to the sound of its wash  against the rocks and tree roots as it hurried past, and to her as she  waited came the thought that here had she found a means by which to  end her woe.    \"I have lost my Love,\" she moaned. \"What is Life to me any longer!  Come to me then, O Death!\"    So then she sprang into the wan water, hoping that very swiftly it  might bear her grief-worn soul down to the shades. But the river bore  her up and carried her to its shallows in a fair meadow where Pan  himself sat on the bank and merrily dabbled his feet in the flowing  water. And when Psyche, shamed and wet, looked at him with sad eyes,  the god spoke to her gently and chid her for her folly. She was too  young and much too fair to try to end her life so rudely, he said. The  river gods would never be so unkind as to drive so beautiful a maiden  in rough haste down to the Cocytus valley.    \"Thou must dree thy weird like all other daughters of men, fair  Psyche,\" he said. \"He or she who fain would lose their lives, are ever  held longest in life. Only when the gods will it shall thy days on  earth be done.\"    And Psyche, knowing that in truth the gods had spared her to endure  more sorrow, looked in his face with a very piteous gaze, and wandered  on. As she wandered, she found that her feet had led her near the  place where her two sisters dwelt.    \"I shall tell them of the evil they have wrought,\" she thought.  \"Surely they must sorrow when they know that by their cruel words they  stole my faith from me and robbed me of my Love and of my happiness.\"    Gladly the two women saw the stricken form of Psyche and looked at her  face, all marred by grief. Well, indeed, had their plot succeeded;  their malice had drunk deep, yet deeper still they drank, for with  scornful laughter they drove her from their palace doors. Very  quickly, when she had gone, the elder sought the place where she had  stood when Zephyrus bore her in safety to that palace of pleasure  where Psyche dwelt with her Love. Now that Psyche was no longer there,  surely the god by whom she had been beloved would gladly have as her  successor the beautiful woman who was now much more fair than the  white-faced girl with eyes all red with weeping. And such certainty  did the vengeful gods put in her heart that she held out her arms, and  calling aloud:    \"Bear me to him in thine arms, Zephyrus! Behold I come, my lord!\" she  sprang from the high cliff on which she stood, into space. And the  ravens that night feasted on her shattered body. So also did it befall  the younger sister, deluded by the Olympians to her own destruction,  so that her sin might be avenged.    For many a weary day and night Psyche wandered, ever seeking to find  her Love, ever longing to do something by which to atone for the deed  that had been her undoing. From temple to temple she went, but nowhere  did she come near him, until at length in Cyprus she came to the place  where Aphrodite herself had her dwelling. And inasmuch as her love had  made her very bold, and because she no longer feared death, nor could  think of pangs more cruel than those that she already knew, Psyche  sought the presence of the goddess who was her enemy, and humbly  begged her to take her life away.    With flaming scorn and anger Aphrodite received her.        \"O thou fool,\" she said, \"I will not let thee die!      But thou shalt reap the harvest thou hast sown,      And many a day that wretched lot bemoan;      Thou art my slave, and not a day shall be      But I will find some fitting task for thee.\"    There began then for Psyche a time of torturing misery of which only  those could speak who have knowledge of the merciless stripes with  which the goddess can scourge the hearts of her slaves. With cruel  ingenuity, Aphrodite invented labours for her.    In uncountable quantity, and mingled in inextricable and bewildering  confusion, there lay in the granary of the goddess grains of barley  and of wheat, peas and millet, poppy and coriander seed. To sort out  each kind and lay them in heaps was the task allotted for one day, and  woe be to her did she fail. In despair, Psyche began her hopeless  labour. While the sun shone, through a day that was for her too short,  she strove to separate the grains, but when the shadows of evening  made it hard for her to distinguish one sort from another, only a few  very tiny piles were the result of her weary toil. Very soon the  goddess would return, and Psyche dared not think what would be the  punishment meted out to her. Rapidly the darkness fell, but while the  dying light still lingered in some parts of the granary, it seemed to  Psyche as though little dark trickles of water began to pour from  underneath the doors and through the cracks in the wall. Trembling she  watched the ceaseless motion of those long, dark lines, and then, in  amazement, realised that what she saw were unending processions of  ants. And as though one who loved her directed their labours, the  millions of busy little toilers swiftly did for Psyche what she  herself had failed to do. When at length they went away, in those long  dark lines that looked like the flow of a thread-like stream, the  grains were all piled up in high heaps, and the sad heart of Psyche  knew not only thankful relief, but had a thrill of gladness.    \"Eros sent them to me:\" she thought. \"Even yet his love for me is not  dead.\"    And what she thought was true.    Amazed and angry, Aphrodite looked at the task she had deemed  impossible, well and swiftly performed. That Psyche should possess  such magic skill only incensed her more, and next day she said to her  new slave:    \"Behold, on the other side of that glittering stream, my  golden-fleeced sheep crop the sweet flowers of the meadow. To-day must  thou cross the river and bring me back by evening a sample of wool  pulled from each one of their shining fleeces.\"    Then did Psyche go down to the brink of the river, and even as her  white feet splashed into the water, she heard a whisper of warning  from the reeds that bowed their heads by the stream.    \"Beware! O Psyche,\" they said. \"Stay on the shore and rest until the  golden-fleeced sheep lie under the shade of the trees in the evening  and the murmur of the river has lulled them to sleep.\"    But Psyche said, \"Alas, I must do the bidding of the goddess. It will  take me many a weary hour to pluck the wool that she requires.\"    And again the reeds murmured, \"Beware! for the golden-fleeced sheep,  with their great horns, are evil creatures that lust for the lives of  mortals, and will slay thee even as thy feet reach the other bank.  Only when the sun goes down does their vice depart from them, and  while they sleep thou canst gather of their wool from the bushes and  from the trunks of the trees.\"    And again the heart of Psyche felt a thrill of happiness, because she  knew that she was loved and cared for still. All day she rested in the  wood by the river and dreamt pleasant day-dreams, and when the sun had  set she waded to the further shore and gathered the golden wool in the  way that the reeds had told her. When in the evening she came to the  goddess, bearing her shining load, the brow of Aphrodite grew dark.    \"If thou art so skilled in magic that no danger is danger to thee, yet  another task shall I give thee that is worthy of thy skill,\" she said,  and laid upon Psyche her fresh commands.    Sick with dread, Psyche set out next morning to seek the black stream  out of which Aphrodite had commanded her to fill a ewer. Part of its  waters flowed into the Styx, part into the Cocytus, and well did  Psyche know that a hideous death from the loathly creatures that  protected the fountain must be the fate of those who risked so proud  an attempt. Yet because she knew that she must \"dree her weird,\" as  Pan had said, she plodded onward, towards that dark mountain from  whose side gushed the black water that she sought. And then, once  again, there came to her a message of love. A whirring of wings she  heard, and        \"O'er her head there flew the bird of Jove,      The bearer, of his servant, friend of Love,      Who, when he saw her, straightway towards her flew,      And asked her why she wept, and when he knew,      And who she was, he said, 'Cease all thy fear,      For to the black waves I thy ewer will bear,      And fill it for thee; but, remember me,      When thou art come unto thy majesty.'\"    And, yet once again, the stricken heart of Psyche was gladdened, and  when at nightfall she came with her ewer full of water from the dread  stream and gave it to Aphrodite, although she knew that a yet more  arduous task was sure to follow, her fear had all passed away.    With beautiful, sullen eyes, Aphrodite received her when she brought  the water. And, with black brow, she said: \"If thou art so skilled in  magic that no danger is known to thee, I shall now give thee a task  all worthy of thy skill.\"    Thereon she told her that she must seek that dark valley where no  silver nor golden light ever strikes on the black waters of Cocytus  and of the Styx; and where Pluto reigns in gloomy majesty over the  restless shades. From Proserpine she was to crave for Aphrodite the  gift of a box of magical ointment, the secret of which was known to  the Queen of Darkness alone, and which was able to bring to those who  used it, beauty more exquisite than any that the eyes of gods or of  men had as yet looked upon.    \"I grow weary and careworn,\" said Aphrodite, and she looked like a  rose that has budded in Paradise as she spoke. \"My son was wounded by  a faithless slave in whom, most weakly, he put his trust, and in  tending to his wound, my beauty has faded.\"    And at these scornful words, the heart of Psyche leaped"]]]
