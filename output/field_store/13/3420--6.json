Alleyn, though deferring to sign a new lease, allowed Burbage to  continue in possession of the property at \"the old rent of L14.\" Yet  the Theatre seems not to have been used for plays after the original  lease expired.[84] The Lord Chamberlain's Company, which had been  occupying the Theatre, and of which Richard Burbage was the chief  actor, had moved to the Curtain; and the author of _Skialetheia_,  printed in 1598, refers to the old playhouse as empty: \"But see,  yonder, one, like the unfrequented Theatre, walks in dark silence and  vast solitude.\"[85]    [Footnote 84: The lease expired on April 13, 1597; on July 28 the  Privy Council closed all playhouses until November. The references to  the Theatre in _The Remembrancia_ (see The Malone Society's  _Collections_, I, 78) do not necessarily imply that the building was  then actually used by the players.]    [Footnote 85: The same fact is revealed in the author's remark, \"If my  dispose persuade me to a play, I'le to the Rose or Curtain,\" for at  this time only the Chamberlain's Men and the Admiral's Men were  allowed to play.]    To Cuthbert Burbage such a state of affairs was intolerable, and on  September 29, 1598, he made a new appeal to Alleyn. Alleyn proffered a  lease already drawn up, but Cuthbert would not \"accept thereof\"  because of the \"very unreasonable covenants therein contained.\"[86]    [Footnote 86: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 216, 249.]    Shortly after this fruitless interview, or late in 1598, Gyles Alleyn  resolved to take advantage of the fact that Cuthbert Burbage had not  removed the Theatre before the expiration of the first twenty-one  years. He contended that since Cuthbert had \"suffered the same there  to continue till the expiration of the said term ... the right and  interest of the said Theatre was both in law and conscience absolutely  vested\" now in himself; accordingly he planned \"to pull down the same,  and to convert the wood and timber thereof to some better use for the  benefit\" of himself.[87]    [Footnote 87: _Ibid._, pp. 277, 288.]    But, unfortunately for Alleyn, Cuthbert Burbage \"got intelligence\" of  this purpose, and at once set himself to the task of saving his  property. He and his brother Richard, the great actor, took into their  confidence the chief members of the Lord Chamberlain's Company, then  performing at the Curtain Playhouse, namely William Shakespeare, John  Heminges, Augustine Phillips, Thomas Pope, and William Kempe. These  men agreed to form with the Burbages a syndicate to finance the  erection of a new playhouse. The two Burbages agreed to bear one-half  the expense, including the timber and other materials of the old  Theatre, and the five actors promised to supply the other half.  Together they leased a suitable plot of land on the Bankside near  Henslowe's Rose, the lease dating from December 25, 1598. These  details having been arranged, it remained only for the Burbages to  save their building from the covetousness of Alleyn.    On the night of December 28, 1598,[88] Alleyn being absent in the  country, Cuthbert Burbage, his brother Richard, his friend William  Smith, \"of Waltham Cross, in the County of Hartford, gentleman,\" Peter  Street, \"cheefe carpenter,\" and twelve others described as \"laborers  such as wrought for wages,\" gathered at the Theatre and began to tear  down the building. We learn that the widow of James Burbage \"was  there, and did see the doing thereof, and liked well of it\";[89] and  we may suspect that at some time during the day Shakespeare and the  other actors were present as interested spectators.    [Footnote 88: The date, January 20, 1599, seems to be an error.]    [Footnote 89: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 238.]    The episode is thus vividly described by the indignant Gyles Allen:         The said Cuthbert Burbage, having intelligence of your       subject's purpose herein, and unlawfully combining and       confederating himself with the said Richard Burbage and one       Peter Street, William Smith, and diverse other persons to       the number of twelve, to your subject unknown, did about       the eight and twentieth day of December, in the one and       fortieth year of your highness reign, and sithence your       highness last and general pardon, by the confederacy       aforesaid, riotously assembled themselves together, and then       and there armed themselves with diverse and many unlawful       and offensive weapons, as namely swords, daggers, bills,       axes, and such like, and so armed did then repair unto the       said Theatre, and then and there armed as aforesaid, in very       riotous, outrageous, and forceable manner, and contrary to       the laws of your highness realm, attempted to pull down the       said Theatre. Whereupon, diverse of your subjects, servants       and farmers, then going about in peaceable manner to procure       them to desist from that unlawful enterprise, they, the said       riotous persons aforesaid, notwithstanding procured then       therein with great violence, not only then and there       forcibly and riotously resisting your subjects, servants,       and farmers, but also then and there pulling, breaking, and       throwing down the said Theatre in very outrageous, violent,       and riotous sort.[90]    [Footnote 90: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 278-79. This document was  discovered by J.O. Halliwell-Phillipps, who printed extracts in his  _Outlines_. See also Ordish, _Early London Theatres_, pp. 75-76.]    The workmen, under the expert direction of Peter Street, carried the  timber and other materials of the old Theatre to the tract of land on  the Bankside recently leased by the new syndicate--as Gyles Alleyn  puts it, \"did then also in most forcible and riotous manner take and  carry away from thence all the wood and timber thereof unto the  Bankside, in the Parish of St. Mary Overies, and there erected a new  playhouse with the said timber and wood.\"    The playhouse thus erected was, of course, an entirely new structure.  Nearly a quarter of a century had elapsed since James Burbage designed  the old Theatre, during which time a great development had taken place  both in histrionic art and in play writing; and, no doubt, many  improvements were possible in the stage and in the auditorium to  provide better facilities for the actors and greater comfort for the  spectators. In designing such improvements the architect had the  advice and help of the actors, including Shakespeare; and he succeeded  in producing a playhouse that was a model of excellence. The name  selected by the syndicate for their new building was \"The Globe.\" For  further details as to its construction, and for its subsequent  history, the reader is referred to the chapter dealing with that  building.    When Gyles Alleyn learned that the Burbages had demolished the Theatre  and removed the timber to the Bankside, he was deeply incensed, not  only at the loss of the building, but also, no doubt, at being  completely outwitted. At once he instituted suit against Cuthbert  Burbage; but he was so intemperate in his language and so reckless in  his charges that he weakened his case. The suit dragged for a few  years, was in part referred to Francis Bacon, and finally in the  summer of 1601 was dismissed. Thus the history of the first London  playhouse, which is chiefly the history of quarrels and litigation,  came to a close.    It is not possible now to indicate exactly the stay of the different  troupes at the Theatre; the evidence is scattered and incomplete, and  the inferences to be drawn are often uncertain.    When the building was opened in 1576, it was, no doubt, occupied by  the Earl of Leicester's troupe, of which Burbage was the manager, and  for which, presumably, the structure had been designed. Yet other  troupes of players may also have been allowed to use the  building--when Leicester's Men were touring the provinces, or,  possibly, on days when Leicester's Men did not act. This arrangement  lasted about six years.    In 1582 the use of the Theatre was interrupted by the interference of  Peckham. For a long time the actors \"could not enjoy the premises,\"  and Burbage was forced to keep Peckham's servants out of the building  with an armed guard night and day. As a result of this state of  affairs, Leicester's troupe was dissolved; \"many of the players,\" we  are told, were driven away, and the rest \"forsook the said Theatre.\"  The last notice of these famous players is a record of their  performance at Court on February 10, 1583.    Shortly after this, in March, 1583, Tilney, the Master of the Revels,  organized under royal patronage a new company called the Queen's Men.  For this purpose he selected twelve of the best actors of the realm,  including some of the members of Leicester's company.[91] The two  best-known actors in the new organization were the Queen's favorite  comedian, Richard Tarleton, the immortal \"Lord of Mirth,\" and John  Lanham, the leader and apparently the manager of the troupe. James  Burbage, who may by this time, if not before, have retired from  acting, was not included.    [Footnote 91: For a list of the Queen's Men see Wallace, _op. cit._,  p. 11.]    The newly organized Queen's Men in all probability occupied the  Theatre which had been left vacant by the dissolution of Leicester's  company. Mr. Wallace denies this, mainly on the evidence of a permit  issued by the Lord Mayor, November 28, 1583, granting the Queen's Men  the privilege of acting \"at the sign of the Bull [Inn] in Bishopgate  Street, and the sign of the Bell [Inn] in Gracious Street, and nowhere  else within this city.\" But this permit, I think, lends scant support"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22409"],[0,"A Woman who went to Alaska (#11)"],[1,"we were again at the  Aleutian Islands and in the rough waters of Unimak Pass. As we drew  nearer and entered the harbor so well land-locked, the sun dipped low  into yellow-red western waters, thereby casting long shadows aslant our  pathway so delicately shaded in greens.    The little hamlet of Dutch Harbor nestled cosily at the foot of the  mountains which bordered the bay, and here numbers of ships lay anchored  at rest. Passing along easily beyond another high mountain, we were soon  at the dock of Unalaska, beside other great ships in port. Both groups  of craft were evidently waiting for the ice to clear from Behring Sea  before proceeding on their way northward, and we counted sixteen ships  of different kinds and sizes, the majority of them large steamers. All  were loaded with passengers and freight for Nome. Scout boats had  already been sent out to investigate and find, if possible, a passage  through the ice fields, and the return of these scouts with good news  was anxiously watched and waited for, as the most desired thing at that  time was a speedy and safe landing on the supposedly golden beach sands  of Nome.    At Unalaska we spent four days taking on fresh water and coal, during  which time passengers visited back and forth from the waiting steamers,  many persons having friends on other boats and each having a curiosity  to see if they were faring as well or ill as he, comparing notes as to  the expense of traveling with the different companies, etc. Passengers  on the \"St. Paul\" agreed that they had \"no kick comin',\" which was one  of the commonest slang phrases, intended to mean that they had no fault  to find with the Alaska Commercial Company and their steamer \"St. Paul.\"  All were well cared for and satisfied, as well they might be, with the  service of the ship's men.    Leaving Unalaska the sun shone clear and cold upon the mountains where  in places the sides looked black from the late fires started in the deep  tundra by miscreants. The tops of the mountains were covered with snow.  Down deep gorges dashed mountain waters of melting snow and ice,  hurrying to leap off gullied and rocky cliffs into the sea. Their  progress was never impeded. No tree nor shrub obstructed the way with  gnarled old trunks, twisted roots, or low hanging branches, for none  grow in Unalaska, and the bold dignity and grandeur of the mountains is  never diminished by these lesser objects.    As our ship sailed out into Behring Sea we were closely followed by the  steamer \"George W. Elder,\" whose master, an old friend of our captain,  had decided to follow in our wake, he being less familiar than the  latter with Alaskan waters, and having confidence in the ability of his  friend to successfully pilot both ships to Cape Nome.    [Illustration: STEAMSHIP ST. PAUL.]          CHAPTER VIII.    FRESH DANGER.      At this plan all the passengers appeared pleased. We were now entering  upon the most dangerous part of our voyage. No one knew what was before  us. If our ship should receive serious damage from the ice floes or  bergs with which we were almost sure to come in contact, it would be  well if we were accompanied by a sister ship which could render  assistance. If she were in trouble and we unharmed, we could lend a  helping hand to her; and so none murmured at the unique arrangement.    Nothing, however, was seen of the much dreaded ice until about noon on  Sunday, June tenth. The air had been steadily growing colder so that  woolen clothing and fur wraps were in demand. Men thrust their hands  into their pockets, or drew on gloves while they stamped their feet upon  deck to keep themselves warm in the open air. Soon to our right lay a  great semi-circular field of ice, in places piled high, looking cold,  jagged and dangerous. In the distance those having field-glasses saw two  clumsy, slow-moving objects which they could easily distinguish as polar  bears on floating cakes of ice.    By the latter we were soon surrounded, and were obliged, slowly and  cautiously, to pick our way through towards the narrowest spot, or where  the nearest open water could be seen beyond. Floating ice now lay all  around us, appearing only a few feet above the water; below it the bergs  extended many times that distance. Sometimes they were small and looked  harmless enough; but many were large, massive, and full of death-dealing  power if urged against the sides of a ship by the wind or struck  accidentally. Carefully we picked our way along, watched as we were by  every soul aboard the \"Elder\" following, until we had successfully made  our way through the ice pack and glided out into the blue waters beyond.  Then came a great shout from the throats of spectators on both ships,  and praises for the master and his crew who were doing such good work  were loudly sung.    Immediately our manoeuvres were repeated by the \"Elder,\" and we watched  her with interest equal to their own; then as she passed the danger  point and swung safely through the ice bergs and out, both ships, like  fresh, uncaged birds, sped lightly and swiftly over the water northward.    In a few hours we were awakened from afternoon naps by the ringing of  the ship's bell and found ourselves again surrounded by floating bergs.  A man in the bow was taking soundings with lead and line, calling out  every few seconds. \"No bottom! No bottom!\" and then hauling in the lead  again as the ship crept carefully along. From submerged floes there was  now the greatest danger, but we gradually drew away from all floating  ice and sailed safely away as before.    Each Sunday on board the \"St. Paul\" had been marked by some religious  service conducted by one of the preachers, while an improvised quartet  of voices led the singing. June tenth service had been held in the  forenoon, when a short sermon had followed the singing of a few familiar  old hymns by the assembled passengers. Now in the early evening, while I  sat with a few friends in the dining salon rehearsing hymns for the  coming service, suddenly the ship's bell rang out upon the still night  air. Instantly there came a jar, a quiver, and all rushed out upon deck  to see what had happened. We had been rudely jostled by an unseen ice  floe while the eyes of the pilot had been occupied by the ones visible.  Several times this happened. We were in the midst of a sea of ice floes.  There was no visible egress ahead; we must back out, if possible, as we  had come.    Soon our steamer was stopped for the night, and religious services were  begun in the dining salon. About one hundred persons were present. Our  quartet sang five or six selections, \"Rock of Ages\" and \"Throw Out the  Life-line\" among others. The preacher offered prayer, read Scripture  promises, and spoke feelingly for twenty minutes. He talked of our lives  being only short spans, the length of which depends upon the will of  God; and it is the duty of each soul, he said, to be prepared to meet  its Maker.    It was a solemn moment for all. Outside the ice drifted slowly about,  thick fog settled over us, the ship's whistle sounded, and night came  on. The loneliness increased.    When the speaker had closed his remarks he asked that the quartet sing  \"Nearer My God to Thee,\" and we sang it. Sweet and firm was the voice of  the English girl now, and when, with uplifted arm and softly spoken  benediction, the minister dismissed us, it was to go upon deck feeling  stronger and much comforted.    There was yet no breath of wind stirring. For this we thanked a kind  Providence, for, had the wind risen, our lives would have been in  jeopardy indeed. In that case the massive ice cakes would have been  blown swiftly and heavily about to crush all ships like egg-shells and  send them to the bottom of the sea.    For breakfast we ate yellow corn-bread and bacon with a relish such as  it never gave at home, and even those who had been seasick for days were  beginning to \"get away\" with their rations. At eight in the morning the  anchor with its rattling chain was dropped and we lay in an open spot.  An hour later there was no perceptible motion of the ship, the sea was  smooth as a carpet, and our tired captain had gone to bed. For  forty-eight hours he had not slept, nor scarcely left the bridge, and  the rest was badly needed.    Two days we lay anchored in a dead calm, waiting for the passing ice to  open a way for us through to Nome. Three ships lay near us, as well as  two larger ones out farther in the ice-fields; but the fog hung grey and  persistent over our heads and we could do nothing but wait. Another  concert was given by the musicians, and as the steamer lay gently  rocking upon the waters of the great sea, through the open front windows  there floated out to our sister ship the sweet and pleasing strains of  the violins and mandolins.    Were they telling in lively allegretto movements of our safe landing on  golden shores, and of our successful achievements followed by a safe and  happy return to home and loved ones? Or were the adagios mournfully  predicting perils, coming disaster and death? Who could tell? For  myself, I felt that whatever came to me would be in accordance with the  will and wish of a Higher Power, and it would be all right in any case.  My choice was, of course, from the human standpoint, for life, happiness  and success in the pursuit of gold; but this with me was not an  obstinate nor rebellious sentiment. Should all these good things be  denied me, I could say, it is well. I felt satisfied that the way for my  going to Alaska had been wonderfully opened by an Unseen Influence which  I had been taught from earliest childhood to recognize, and this  belief, which was a firm and abiding one, held me calm and contented.  Night after night I slept in my berth as soundly as though at home in my  bed, and not even the sudden jolt and quiver of the icebergs coming  often into collision with the ship caused me to waken.
