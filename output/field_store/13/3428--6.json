These fifteen gentlemen  constituted themselves into _l'Ordre de Bon Temps_, one of whom was  grandmaster for a day, and bound to cater for the company.  Each tried,  of course, to excel the other in the quantity of game and fish they  were able to gather from the {58} surrounding country, and the  consequence was, Poutrincourt's table never wanted any of the luxuries  that the river or forest could supply.  At the dinner hour the  grandmaster, with the insignia of his order, a costly collar around his  neck, a staff in his hand, and a napkin on his shoulder, came into the  hall at the head of his brethren, each of whom carried some dish.  The  Indians were frequent guests at their feasts, especially old Membertou,  a famous Micmac or Souriquois chief, who always retained a warm  attachment for the pale-faced strangers.  Songs of La Belle France were  sung; many a toast was drunk in some rare vintage,--the flames flew up  the huge chimney,--the Indians squatted on the floor, laughing like the  merry Frenchmen.  When the pipe went around--with its lobster-like bowl  and tube elaborately worked with porcupine quills--stories were told,  and none excelled the Indians themselves in this part of the  entertainment.  At last, when the tobacco was all exhausted, the  grandmaster resigned his regalia of office to his successor, who lost  no time in performing his duties.  Thus the long winter evenings passed  in that lonely French fort at the verge of an untamed continent.    Then came bad news from France.  Late in the spring of 1607, a vessel  sailed into the basin with letters from De Monts that the colony would  have to be broken up, as his charter had been revoked, and the Company  could no longer support Port Royal.  The Breton and Basque merchants,  who were very hostile to De Monts's monopoly, had {59} succeeded in  influencing the government to withdraw its patronage from him and his  associates.  Soon afterwards the little colony regretfully left Port  Royal, which never looked so lovely in their eyes as they passed on to  the Bay of Fundy, and saw the whole country in the glory of mid-summer.  The Indians, especially Membertou, watched the departure of their new  friends with unfeigned regret, and promised to look carefully after the  safety of the fort and its contents.    As soon as Poutrincourt reached his native country he did his best to  make friends at the Court, as he was resolved on returning to Acadia,  while Champlain decided to venture to the St. Lawrence, where I shall  take up his memorable story later.  Poutrincourt's prospects, for a  time, were exceedingly gloomy.  De Monts was able to assist him but  very little, and the adventurous Baron himself was involved in debt and  litigations, but he eventually succeeded in obtaining a renewal of his  grant from the King, and interesting some wealthy traders in the  enterprise.  Then some difficulties of a religious character threatened  to interfere with the success of the expedition.  The society of  Jesuits was, at this time, exceedingly influential at court, and, in  consequence of their representations, the King ordered that Pierre  Biard, professor of theology at Lyons, should accompany the expedition.  Though Poutrincourt was a good Catholic, he mistrusted this religious  order, and succeeded in deceiving Father Biard, who was waiting for him  at Bordeaux, by taking his departure from Dieppe in company with {60}  Father Fleche, who was not a member of the Jesuits.    The ship entered Port Royal basin in the beginning of June, 1610.  Here  they were agreeably surprised to find the buildings and their contents  perfectly safe, and their old friend Membertou, now a centenarian,  looking as hale as ever, and overwhelmed with joy at the return of the  friendly palefaces.  Among the first things that Poutrincourt did,  after his arrival, was to make converts of the Indians.  Father Fleche  soon convinced Membertou and all his tribe of the truths of  Christianity.  Membertou was named Henri, after the king; his chief  squaw Marie, after the queen.  The Pope, the Dauphin, Marguerite de  Valois, and other ladies and gentlemen famous in the history of their  times, became sponsors for the Micmac converts who were gathered into  mother church on St. John's day, with the most imposing ceremonies that  the French could arrange in that wild country.    Conscious of the influence of the Jesuits at Court, and desirous of  counteracting any prejudice that might have been created against him,  Poutrincourt decided to send his son, a fine youth of eighteen years,  in the ship returning to France, with a statement showing his zeal in  converting the natives of the new colony.    When this youthful ambassador reached France, Henry of Navarre had  perished by the knife of Ravaillac, and Marie de' Medici, that wily,  cruel, and false Italian, was regent during the minority of her son,  Louis XIII.  The Jesuits were now {61} all-powerful at the Louvre, and  it was decided that Fathers Biard and Ennemond Masse should accompany  Biencourt to Acadia.  The ladies of the Court, especially Madame de  Guercheville, wife of Duke de la Rochefoucauld de Liancourt, whose  reputation could not be assailed by the tongue of scandal, even in a  state of society when virtue was too often the exception, interested  themselves in the work of converting the savages of Acadia.  The  business of the Protestant traders of Dieppe was purchased and made  over to the Jesuits.  Thus did these indefatigable priests, for the  first time, engage in the work of converting the savage in the American  wilderness.    The vessel which took Biencourt and his friends back to Port Royal  arrived on the 22nd of July, 1611, off the fort, where Poutrincourt and  his colonists were exceedingly short of supplies.  His very first act  was to appoint his son as vice-admiral, while he himself went on to  France with the hope of obtaining further aid about the middle of July.    The total number of persons in the colony was only twenty-two,  including the two Jesuits, who immediately commenced to learn Micmac,  as the first step necessary to the success of the work they had in  hand.  The two priests suffered many hardships, but they bore their  troubles with a patience and resignation which gained them even the  admiration of those who were not prepossessed in their favour.  Masse,  who had gone to live among the Indians, was nearly starved and smoked  to death in their rude camps; but still he appears to have persevered  in that course of life as long as he possibly {62} could.  About this  time the priests had the consolation of performing the last offices for  the veteran Membertou, the staunch friend of the French colonists.  On  his death-bed he expressed a strong desire to be buried with his  forefathers, but the arguments of his priestly advisers overcame his  superstition, and his remains were finally laid in consecrated ground.    Matters looked very gloomy by the end of February, when a ship arrived  very opportunely from France with a small store of supplies.  The news  from Poutrincourt was most discouraging.  Unable to raise further funds  on his own responsibility, he had accepted the proffer of assistance  from Mme. de Guercheville, who, in her zeal, had also bought from De  Monts all his claims over the colony, with the exception of Port Royal,  which belonged to Poutrincourt.  The King not only consented to the  transfer but gave her a grant of the territory extending from Florida  to Canada.  The society of Jesuits was therefore virtually in  possession of North America as far as a French deed could give it away.  But the French king forgot when he was making this lavish gift of a  continent, that the British laid claims to the same region and had  already established a colony in Virginia, which was then an undefined  territory, extending from Florida to New France.  Both France and  England were now face to face on the new continent, and a daring  English adventurer was about to strike in Acadia the first blow for  English supremacy.    Such was the position of affairs at the time of the {63} arrival of the  new vessel and cargo, which were under the control of Simon Imbert, who  had formerly been a servant to Poutrincourt.  Among the passengers was  another Jesuit father, Gilbert Du Thet, who came out in the interests  of Mme. de Guercheville and his own order.  The two agents quarrelled  from the very day they set out until they arrived at Port Royal, and  then the colony took the matter up.  At last the difficulties were  settled by Du Thet receiving permission to return to France.    A few months later, at the end of May, 1613, another French ship  anchored off Port Royal.  She had been sent out with a fine supply of  stores, not by Poutrincourt, but by Mme. de Guercheville, and was under  the orders of M. Saussaye, a gentleman by birth and a man of ability.  On board were two Jesuits, Fathers Quentin and Gilbert Du Thet and a  number of colonists.  Poutrincourt, it appeared, was in prison and ill,  unable to do anything whatever for his friends across the ocean.  This  was, indeed, sad news for Biencourt and his faithful allies, who had  been anxiously expecting assistance from France.    At Port Royal the new vessel took on board the two priests Biard and  Masse, and sailed towards the coast of New England; for Saussaye's  instructions were to found a new colony in the vicinity of Pentagoet  (Penobscot).  In consequence of the prevalent sea-fogs, however, they  were driven to the island of Monts-Deserts, where they found a harbour  which, it was decided, would answer all their purposes on the western  side of Soames's Sound.  Saussaye and {64} his party had commenced to  erect buildings for the new colony, when an event occurred which placed  a very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22566"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#11)"],[1,"be contented in any other land than our own, for long.  Even if we should come to unpleasant places on our way it is necessary,  in order to reach the earth's surface, to keep moving on toward it.\"    \"In that case,\" said the man, \"it will be best for you to cross our  Valley and mount the spiral staircase inside the Pyramid Mountain. The  top of that mountain is lost in the clouds, and when you reach it you  will be in the awful Land of Naught, where the Gargoyles live.\"    \"What are Gargoyles?\" asked Zeb.    \"I do not know, young sir. Our greatest Champion, Overman-Anu, once  climbed the spiral stairway and fought nine days with the Gargoyles  before he could escape them and come back; but he could never be induced  to describe the dreadful creatures, and soon afterward a bear caught  him and ate him up.\"    The wanderers were rather discouraged by this gloomy report, but Dorothy  said with a sigh:    \"If the only way to get home is to meet the Gurgles, then we've got to  meet 'em. They can't be worse than the Wicked Witch or the Nome King.\"    \"But you must remember you had the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman to help  you conquer those enemies,\" suggested the Wizard. \"Just now, my dear,  there is not a single warrior in your company.\"    \"Oh, I guess Zeb could fight if he had to. Couldn't you, Zeb?\" asked the  little girl.    \"Perhaps; if I had to,\" answered Zeb, doubtfully.    \"And you have the jointed sword that you chopped the veg'table Sorcerer  in two with,\" the girl said to the little man.    \"True,\" he replied; \"and in my satchel are other useful things to fight  with.\"    \"What the Gargoyles most dread is a noise,\" said the man's voice. \"Our  Champion told me that when he shouted his battle-cry the creatures  shuddered and drew back, hesitating to continue the combat. But they  were in great numbers, and the Champion could not shout much because he  had to save his breath for fighting.\"    \"Very good,\" said the Wizard; \"we can all yell better than we can fight,  so we ought to defeat the Gargoyles.\"    \"But tell me,\" said Dorothy, \"how did such a brave Champion happen to  let the bears eat him? And if he was invis'ble, and the bears invis'ble,  who knows that they really ate him up?\"    \"The Champion had killed eleven bears in his time,\" returned the unseen  man; \"and we know this is true because when any creature is dead the  invisible charm of the dama-fruit ceases to be active, and the slain one  can be plainly seen by all eyes. When the Champion killed a bear  everyone could see it; and when the bears killed the Champion we all saw  several pieces of him scattered about, which of course disappeared again  when the bears devoured them.\"    They now bade farewell to the kind but unseen people of the cottage, and  after the man had called their attention to a high, pyramid-shaped  mountain on the opposite side of the Valley, and told them how to travel  in order to reach it, they again started upon their journey.    They followed the course of a broad stream and passed several more  pretty cottages; but of course they saw no one, nor did any one speak to  them. Fruits and flowers grew plentifully all about, and there were many  of the delicious damas that the people of Voe were so fond of.    About noon they stopped to allow Jim to rest in the shade of a pretty  orchard, and while they plucked and ate some of the cherries and plums  that grew there a soft voice suddenly said to them:    \"There are bears near by. Be careful.\"    The Wizard got out his sword at once, and Zeb grabbed the horse-whip.  Dorothy climbed into the buggy, although Jim had been unharnessed from  it and was grazing some distance away.    The owner of the unseen voice laughed lightly and said:    \"You cannot escape the bears that way.\"    \"How _can_ we 'scape?\" asked Dorothy, nervously, for an unseen danger is  always the hardest to face.    \"You must take to the river,\" was the reply. \"The bears will not venture  upon the water.\"    \"But we would be drowned!\" exclaimed the girl.    \"Oh, there is no need of that,\" said the voice, which from its gentle  tones seemed to belong to a young girl. \"You are strangers in the Valley  of Voe, and do not seem to know our ways; so I will try to save you.\"    The next moment a broad-leaved plant was jerked from the ground where it  grew and held suspended in the air before the Wizard.    [Illustration: ESCAPING THE INVISIBLE BEARS.]    \"Sir,\" said the voice, \"you must rub these leaves upon the soles of  all your feet, and then you will be able to walk upon the water without  sinking below the surface. It is a secret the bears do not know, and we  people of Voe usually walk upon the water when we travel, and so escape  our enemies.\"    \"Thank you!\" cried the Wizard, joyfully, and at once rubbed a leaf upon  the soles of Dorothy's shoes and then upon his own. The girl took a leaf  and rubbed it upon the kitten's paws, and the rest of the plant was  handed to Zeb, who, after applying it to his own feet, carefully rubbed  it upon all four of Jim's hoofs and then upon the tires of the  buggy-wheels. He had nearly finished this last task when a low growling  was suddenly heard and the horse began to jump around and kick viciously  with his heels.    \"Quick! To the water, or you are lost!\" cried their unseen friend, and  without hesitation the Wizard drew the buggy down the bank and out upon  the broad river, for Dorothy was still seated in it with Eureka in her  arms. They did not sink at all, owing to the virtues of the strange  plant they had used, and when the buggy was in the middle of the stream  the Wizard returned to the bank to assist Zeb and Jim.    The horse was plunging madly about, and two or three deep gashes  appeared upon its flanks, from which the blood flowed freely.    \"Run for the river!\" shouted the Wizard, and Jim quickly freed himself  from his unseen tormenters by a few vicious kicks and then obeyed. As  soon as he trotted out upon the surface of the river he found himself  safe from pursuit, and Zeb was already running across the water toward  Dorothy.    As the little Wizard turned to follow them he felt a hot breath against  his cheek and heard a low, fierce growl. At once he began stabbing at  the air with his sword, and he knew that he had struck some substance  because when he drew back the blade it was dripping with blood. The  third time that he thrust out the weapon there was a loud roar and a  fall, and suddenly at his feet appeared the form of a great red bear,  which was nearly as big as the horse and much stronger and fiercer. The  beast was quite dead from the sword thrusts, and after a glance at its  terrible claws and sharp teeth the little man turned in a panic and  rushed out upon the water, for other menacing growls told him more bears  were near.    On the river, however, the adventurers seemed to be perfectly safe.  Dorothy and the buggy had floated slowly down stream with the current of  the water, and the others made haste to join her. The Wizard opened his  satchel and got out some sticking-plaster with which he mended the cuts  Jim had received from the claws of the bears.    \"I think we'd better stick to the river, after this,\" said Dorothy. \"If  our unknown friend hadn't warned us, and told us what to do, we would  all be dead by this time.\"    \"That is true,\" agreed the Wizard, \"and as the river seems to be flowing  in the direction of the Pyramid Mountain it will be the easiest way for  us to travel.\"    Zeb hitched Jim to the buggy again, and the horse trotted along and drew  them rapidly over the smooth water. The kitten was at first dreadfully  afraid of getting wet, but Dorothy let her down and soon Eureka was  frisking along beside the buggy without being scared a bit. Once a  little fish swam too near the surface, and the kitten grabbed it in her  mouth and ate it up as quick as a wink; but Dorothy cautioned her to be  careful what she ate in this valley of enchantments, and no more fishes  were careless enough to swim within reach.    After a journey of several hours they came to a point where the river  curved, and they found they must cross a mile or so of the Valley before  they came to the Pyramid Mountain. There were few houses in this part,  and few orchards or flowers; so our friends feared they might encounter  more of the savage bears, which they had learned to dread with all their  hearts.    \"You'll have to make a dash, Jim,\" said the Wizard, \"and run as fast as  you can go.\"    \"All right,\" answered the horse; \"I'll do my best. But you must remember  I'm old, and my dashing days are past and gone.\"    All three got into the buggy and Zeb picked up the reins, though Jim  needed no guidance of any sort. The horse was still smarting from the  sharp claws of the invisible bears, and as soon as he was on land and  headed toward the mountain the thought that more of those fearsome  creatures might be near acted as a spur and sent him galloping along in  a way that made Dorothy catch her breath.    Then Zeb, in a spirit of mischief, uttered a growl like that of the  bears, and Jim pricked up his ears and fairly flew. His boney legs moved  so fast they could scarcely be seen, and the Wizard clung fast to the  seat and yelled \"Whoa!\" at the top of his voice.    \"I--I'm 'fraid he's--he's running away!\" gasped Dorothy.    \"I _know_ he is,\" said Zeb; \"but no bear can catch him if he keeps up  that gait--and the harness or the buggy don't break.\"    Jim did not make a mile a minute; but almost before they were aware of  it he drew up at the foot of the mountain, so suddenly that the Wizard  and Zeb both sailed over the dashboard and landed in the soft  grass--where they rolled over several times before they stopped.  Dorothy nearly went with them, but she was holding fast to the iron rail  of the seat, and that saved her. She squeezed the kitten, though, until  it screeched; and then the old cab-horse made several curious sounds  that"]]]
