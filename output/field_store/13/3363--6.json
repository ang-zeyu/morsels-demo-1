I am going to walk over to Whitstone Woods and back.\"    \"Hullo, that's a long trot,\" said Charlie.  \"It must be nearly thirty  miles.\"    \"Something like that,\" said Joe.  \"Walcot and I are going to make a day  of it.\"    \"Which way do you go?\"    \"Through Gurley, and then over Rushton Common and past Slingcomb.\"    \"Never!  I wish I could do thirty miles at a stretch.\"    \"So you will some day.  Good-night.\"    And Charlie went to bed, to dream of the lance-wood top of his rod and  the trout in the Sharle.    In the meanwhile the conspirators had had another meeting in Drift's  den.    \"Well, have you hooked him?\" asked Gus.    \"Yes; it's all right.  He took it all in like a lamb.\"    \"And all the school,\" said Margetson, \"is talking of the great  reconciliation, and the gratification which that event will undoubtedly  afford to your venerable mother.\"    \"Shut up, will you, Margetson?  I've had quite enough of that chaff.\"    \"But I do assure you, Tom--\"    \"That'll do,\" said Tom, snappishly; and Margetson did not go the length  of saying what it was he was so ready to assure him of.    \"Well,\" said Gus, \"we'll meet you and the young cub at the cross roads  by Sharle Bridge.  The races don't begin till twelve, so we shall have  lots of time.  I mean to see if we can't get a trap at Gurley, and do  the thing in style.  What do you say?  We could get one for about ten  bob.\"    \"All serene,\" said Margetson.  \"I'll fork out my share.\"    \"You'll pay for me, Tom,\" said Shadbolt, \"won't you?\"    \"I'll see,\" said Tom.    \"All right, that's settled; and you are seeing about grub, Tom, aren't  you?  Don't forget the etceteras.  What time have you told young mooney-  face?\"    \"Nine.  He's sure to be in time.\"    \"Well, we'll start a little before, you know, and meet you quite by  accident, and the young beggar won't smell a rat till we are safe in  Gurley.\"    \"And if he turns cantankerous?\"    \"Then we can put Shaddy to look after him.\"    \"Who's going to win the Gulley Plate, Gus?\"    And then the party fell to canvassing the entries for the morrow's  races, and making their bets, in which, of course, Tom stood almost  bound to lose, whichever horse won.    Long ere they had parted company Charlie was sound asleep and dreaming,  with me under his pillow.        CHAPTER EIGHT.    HOW MY MASTER DID NOT CATCH THE FISH HE EXPECTED.    About ten years before the time of my story it had happened that in a  famous battle fought between her Majesty's troops and those of a hostile  and savage king, the colours of the 300th Regiment were noticed to be in  imminent peril of capture.  The ensign who carried them was wounded, and  already a score of the enemy were rushing forward to seize the prize and  carry it off in triumph to their king.  Suddenly, however, there dashed  up to the spot a young cornet of dragoons, who, seeing the peril of his  fellow-officer and the colours he carried, dragged him, flag and all, up  nearly into his own saddle, and started off with his precious burden  towards a place of shelter from the fire and spears of the savages.  Before, however, he had gone twenty yards the poor ensign tumbled to the  ground, shot through the heart, yielding with his dying hands his  colours to the dragoon.  That plucky young soldier, wrapping the torn  and stained flag round his body, set his teeth, stooped forward in his  saddle, and, digging his spurs into his horse, galloped for his life.  He had a terrific gauntlet to run, and grandly he ran it.  The friendly  trench was in sight, the cheers of his comrades fell like music on his  ears, a vision of glory and honour flashed through his mind, and then  suddenly he reeled forward in his seat--a malignant shot had found him  out at last, and, with the colours round him, he dropped from his horse  into his comrades' arms a dead man.    This hero was an old Randlebury boy; and ever since that day, on every  anniversary of his glorious death, Randlebury kept, and still keeps,  holiday.    All this Charlie was informed of by his faithful chum, Jim Halliday, as  the former was dressing himself on the morning of the eventful holiday  in question.    What possessed him to get up at six, when he was not to start till nine,  I cannot say.  He even routed me from under his pillow at five, so  fidgety was he, and as soon as ever I pointed to six he bounced out of  bed as if he was shot.    \"What are you up to, getting up at this time?\" growled Jim, who, much to  the mutual delight of the boys, slept in the same room with Charlie.    \"Oh, you know; I don't want to be behindhand,\" replied Charlie.    \"Behindhand!  Why, do you know it's only just six?\"    \"I know that, and I mean to make the most of my holiday.  I say, Jim,  what do they want to give us a holiday for, do you know?\"    \"They don't want to at all; they've got to.\"    \"Got to?  What do you mean?\" inquired Charlie, dragging on his boots.    And then Jim, with many yawns and growls, told him the story; and,  without waiting for his comments thereon, rolled over and went off to  sleep again.    Charlie spent his early hour in polishing up things generally.  When he  had polished up his rod with the lance-wood top, he polished up his  green can and his hooks.  Then he warmed me up with a piece of wash-  leather, and then his many-fanged knife.    By the time these little jobs were accomplished, and Joe's study put in  order, the breakfast bell sounded, and he went down with a mouth sore  with whistling.    He caught sight of Tom Drift at another table, and nodded and waved his  green can to him; he informed every boy within hearing distance that it  was certain to be a fine day, whatever it looked like now; and he made  the wildest and most indiscriminate promises to entertain his whole  acquaintance at no end of a trout supper on the spoils of that day's  sport.  Twenty times during breakfast did he pull me out and look  impatiently at my minute-hand slowly making its way from eight to nine;  and as soon as ever the meal was over he rushed upstairs like mad for  his rod and bag, and then tore down again four steps at a time, nearly  knocking the head master over at the bottom.    \"Gently, my man,\" said that gentleman, recognising in this cannon-ball  of a young fellow his little travelling companion.  \"Why, what's the  matter?\"    \"I beg your pardon, doctor,\" said Charlie; \"did I hurt you?\"    \"Not a bit.  So you are going to fish to-day?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said the beaming Charlie.  \"I say, sir, do you think it'll  be a fine day?\"    \"I hope so--good-bye.  I suppose this can will be full when you come  back?\"    \"Good-bye, sir,\" said Charlie, secretly resolving that if fortune  favoured him he would present the two finest of his trout to the doctor.    He found Drift ready for him when he reached that young gentleman's  study.    Besides his rod, Tom had a somewhat cumbersome bag, which, as it carried  most of the provisions for the whole party, he was not a little surly  about being burdened with.    Charlie, of course, thought it was his and Tom's dinner.    \"Is that the grub?\" he cried.  \"Why, Tom Drift, you have been laying in  a spread!  What a brick you are!  Look here, I'd carry it--isn't it a  weight, though!  If we get all this inside us two we shan't starve!\"    And so they started, Charlie lugging along the bag and whistling like a  lark.    \"Looks cloudy,\" said Tom, who felt he must say something or other.    \"Never mind, all the better for the trout, you know.  I say, I wish I  had my fly on the water this minute.\"    As Tom was silent, Charlie kept up the conversation by himself.    \"I say, Tom Drift,\" said he, \"if your mother could only see us two chaps  going off for a day's fishing she--\"    \"Look here, draw it mild about my mother, young un.  She can take care  of herself well enough.\"    Charlie blushed to the roots of his hair at this rebuke, and for some  time the flow of his conversation was arrested.    It was a good four miles from Randlebury to Sharle Bridge; and long ere  they reached it Charlie's arm ached with the ponderous bag he was  carrying.  He did not, however, like to say anything, still less to ask  Tom to take a turn at carrying it; so he plodded on, changing hands  every few minutes, and buoying himself up with the prospect of the river  and the trout.    Presently they came within sight of the signpost which marks the  junction of the Gurley and Sharle Bridge roads.    \"Here we are at last!\" cried Charlie, panting and puffing.  \"I say, Tom  Drift, I don't believe I could have carried this bag any farther if I'd  tried.\"    \"It'll be lighter when we go home.  Hullo! who are these three?\" for at  this moment Gus, Margetson, and Shadbolt made their appearance.    \"They look like Randlebury fellows by their caps.  Oh, I know who one of  them is,\" added Charlie-- \"Margetson, in the fourth; don't you know  him?\"    \"Rather!\" replied Tom; \"and the other two are Shaddy and Gus.  Who'd  have thought of meeting _them_!\" and he gave a whistle, which succeeded  in attracting the attention of the worthy trio.    Of course their surprise at meeting Tom and his companion was no less  great--in fact, they had to inquire who the youngster was.    \"Where are you off to?\" demanded Gus.    \"We're going to try our luck up the Sharle,\" said Tom.    \"You'll be sold if you do,\" said Gus.  \"We were down looking at it, and  a pretty state it's in.  Old Skinner at the Tannery took it into his  head to leave his gates up last night, and his muck has got into the  river and poisoned every fish in it--hasn't it, Shad?\"    \"Rather!\" replied Shad.  \"I was glad enough to get my nose away from the  place.\"    \"Here's a go, Charlie!\" said Tom, turning to his young companion.    During this short conversation Charlie had passed through all the  anguish of a bitter disappointment.  It is no light thing to have the  hope of days snuffed out all in a moment, and he was ready to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],[0,"My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#11)"],[1,"  turned towards me to resume the conversation.  \"You see--\" began he.    \"Hawkesbury,\" again said Mr Hashford, \"this is the third time I have  told you not to talk.\"    \"Who was talking?\" cried the Henniker, entering at that moment.    \"Hawkesbury, I'm sorry to say, Miss Henniker.\"    \"Hawkesbury--a bad mark for--\"    \"Oh!\" said I, starting up, \"I was talking--\"    \"A bad mark to you, Batchelor, for interrupting me, and another for  talking.  Hawkesbury, a bad mark for talking in class.\"    We were all astonished.  We had hitherto looked upon Hawkesbury as a  privileged person who might do as he liked, and upon Mr Hashford as a  person who had not a soul of his own.  Here was the phenomenon not only  of our schoolfellow getting publicly censured, but of Mr Hashford  backing up Miss Henniker, and Miss Henniker backing up Mr Hashford.    Flanagan afterwards confided to me his theory of this unwonted event.  \"I expect,\" said he, \"Hashford's just got his screw raised, and wants to  show off a bit before the Hen, and she wants to encourage him to be  rather more down on us, you know.  She's got the toothache, too, I know,  and that accounts for her not being particular who she drops on, though  I am surprised she pitched on Hawkesbury.  How pleased your chum Smith  will be!\"    But my friend Smith, when I had a chance of speaking to him, seemed  indifferent about the whole affair, being taken up with troubles of his  own.  A letter had come for him that day, he told me, in tones of fierce  anger.  It had been opened and read as usual, before being handed to  him.  He did not complain of that; that was an indignity we had to  submit to every time we received a letter.  But what he did complain of,  and what had roused his temper, was that the last half-sheet of the  letter had been deliberately torn off and not given to him.    Directly after class he had marched boldly to the Henniker's parlour and  knocked at the door.    \"Come in!\" snapped she.    Smith did come in, and proceeded to business at once.    \"You haven't given me all my letter, ma'am,\" he said.    Miss Henniker looked at him with some of the same astonishment with  which she had regarded me when I once told her she was to see my socks  were regularly darned.    Then she pulled herself up, in her usual chilly manner, and replied, \"I  am aware of that, Smith.\"    \"I want it, please, ma'am,\" said Smith.    Again the Henniker glared at this audacious youth, and again she  replied, \"You will not have it, Smith!\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Leave the room instantly, sir, for daring to speak like that to me, and  write out one hundred lines of Caesar before you get your dinner!\" cried  the Henniker, indignantly.  \"You've no right to keep--\"    \"Smith, follow me!\" interrupted Miss Henniker, in her most irresistible  voice, as she led the way to Mr Ladislaw's study.    Smith did follow her, and was flogged, of course.    I was as indignant as he was at this tale of injustice; it reminded me  of my box of sweets last year, which I had never seen back.    Smith's rage was beyond all bounds.  \"I won't stand it!\" said he;  \"that's all about it, Fred!\"    \"What can we do?\" asked I.    That was the question.  And there was no answering it.  So we slunk back  to our places, nursing our wrath in our bosoms, and vowing all sorts of  vengeance on the Henniker.    Nor were we the only boys in this condition of mind.  Whether it was the  Henniker was thoroughly upset by her toothache, or by Hawkesbury's bad  conduct and Smith's impertinence, I cannot say, but for the next day or  two she even excelled herself in the way she went on.    There was nothing we could do, or think, or devise, that she did not  pounce upon and punish us for.  Some were detained, some were set to  impositions, some were flogged, some were reduced to bread and water,  some had most if not all of their worldly goods confiscated.  Even  Hawkesbury shared the general fate, and for a whole week all Stonebridge  House groaned as it had never groaned before.    Then we could stand it no longer.  We all felt that; and we all found  out that everybody else felt it.  But as usual the question was, what to  do?    It was almost impossible to speak to one another, so closely were we  watched, and even when we did, we discovered that we were all at sixes  and sevens, and agreed only on one thing, which was that we _could not_  stand it.    At length one day, to our infinite jubilation, as we were dismally  walking from the schoolroom to the parlour, we saw the front door open.  A fly was standing at it, and as we passed, the Henniker in her Sunday  get-up was stepping into it!    What had we done to deserve such a mercy?  She was going to pay a state  call somewhere, and for one blessed hour at any rate we should be at  peace!    A council of war was immediately held.  For once in a way Stonebridge  House was unanimous.  We sunk all minor differences for a time in the  grand question, what should we do?    A great many wild suggestions were immediately made.    Rathbone undertook, with the aid of any two other fellows, to inflict  personal chastisement on the public enemy.    This was rejected peremptorily.  It would be no use, we should catch it  all the worse afterwards; besides, bad as she was, the Henniker was a  woman, and it would be cowardly to thrash her.    \"Tie up her hands and feet and gag her,\" suggested Philpot.    Wouldn't do again.  She'd get Ladislaw to help her out.    \"Tie up Ladislaw and Hashford too.\"    We weren't numerous or strong enough to do it.    \"Let's all bolt,\" suggested Flanagan.    They'd send the police after us.  Or if they didn't, how were we to get  on, without money or shelter or anywhere to go?    \"Suppose,\" said I, \"we shut them out of the schoolroom and barricade the  door, and don't let them in till they accept our terms.\"    \"That's more like it,\" said some one; \"but then what about food?  We  can't store enough, even if we emptied the larder, to stand a long  siege.\"    \"Well, then,\" said Smith, \"suppose we screw them up, and don't let them  out till they give in.\"    \"That's it,\" said every one, \"the very thing.\"    \"What do you say, Hawkesbury?\" inquired I.    \"Well,\" said he, smiling pleasantly, \"it's not a nice thing to turn  against one's master and mistress; but really Miss Henniker has been  very vexing lately.\"    \"Hurrah! then you agree?\"  And the question was put all round, every one  assenting.  At least so I thought.  But Smith as usual was doubtful of  Hawkesbury.    \"You agree, Hawkesbury?\" said he.    \"Really,\" said the other, with a smile, \"it isn't nice to be suspected,  Smith.  Isn't it enough to say a thing once?\"    \"Oh yes, yes,\" cried out every one, impatiently, and most anxious to  keep the meeting harmonious.  \"He said he did, Smith; what more do you  want?  Do let's pull all together.\"    \"Just what I want,\" said Smith.    \"Well,\" said Philpot, \"I propose we lock them up in the big schoolroom.\"    \"Wouldn't it be better,\" said Flanagan, \"to lock the Henniker up in her  own room, and let Ladislaw and Hashford have the parlour?  It will be  more comfortable for them.  There's a sofa there and a carpet.  Besides,  the window's a worse one to get out of.\"    \"How about feeding them?\" some one asked.    \"That'll be easy enough,\" said Smith.  \"There's a ventilator over all  the doors, you know.  We can hand the things in there.\"    \"I vote the old Hen gets precious little,\" interposed Rathbone.  \"I  wouldn't give her any.\"    This idea was scouted, and it was resolved that all the prisoners should  have a sufficient, though, at the same time, a limited amount of  provisions.  That being arranged, the next question was, when should we  begin?  We had to take a good many things into account in fixing the  important date.  To-day was Friday.  The butcher, some one said, always  brought the meat for the week on Monday; but the baker never came till  the Wednesday.  So if we began operations on Monday we should have a  good supply of meat but very little bread to start with; and it was  possible, of course, the baker might smell a rat, and get up a rescue.  It would be better, on that account, to defer action till after the  baker's visit on Wednesday.  But then the washerwoman generally came on  the Thursday.  We all voted the washerwoman a nuisance.  We must either  take her a prisoner and keep her in the house, or run the risk of her  finding out that something was wrong and going back to the village and  telling of us.    \"If we could only keep it up a week,\" said Smith, \"I think we could  bring them to terms.\"    \"Suppose we drop a line to the washerwoman the day before not to call,\"  suggested I.    The motion met with universal applause, and I was deputed to carry it  out at the proper time.  The good lady's address I knew was on a slate  in Miss Henniker's pantry.    \"And I tell you what,\" said Smith, starting up with the brilliancy of  the suggestion; \"let's hide away all the bread we can find, except just  what will last over to-morrow.  Then most likely she'll tell the baker  to call on Monday, and we can begin then!\"    It was a brilliant suggestion.  Two of the company departed forthwith to  the larder, and unobserved hid away a few loaves in one of the empty  trunks in the box-room.    Our plans were ripening wonderfully.  But the most difficult business  was yet to come.  What terms should we require of our prisoners as the  price of their release?  And on this point, after long discussion, we  found we could not agree.  Some were for the immediate dismissal of the  Henniker; others demanded that she should not be allowed to speak  without special permission; and others that she should remain in her  parlour all day long, and come out only for prayers and to give orders  to the tradesmen.    These proposals were too absurd to take seriously; and as presently the  company began to grow a little quarrelsome over the matter, it was  decided for"]]]
