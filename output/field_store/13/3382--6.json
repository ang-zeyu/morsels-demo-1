Simon solemnly  blessed John, and his mother cried over him. Mary was a little  surprised at these demonstrations, at what she regarded as a very  temporary separation; but her merry spirits were subdued at the  sight of her aunt's tears, although she, herself, saw nothing to  cry about.    She brightened up, however, when John whispered, as he said goodbye  to her:    \"I shall come across the lake, as often as I can, to see how you  are getting on, Mary.\"    Then he took his place in the stern of the boat. The fishermen  dipped their oars in the water, and the boat drew away from the  little group, who stood watching it as it made its way across the  sparkling water to Hippos.    Upon landing, John at once went to the house where Josephus was  lodging. The latter gave him in charge to the leader of the little  group of men who had attached themselves to him, as his bodyguard.    \"Joab,\" he said, \"this youth will, henceforth, make one of your  party. He is brave and, I think, ready and quick witted. Give him  arms and see that he has all that is needful. Being young, he will  be able to mingle unsuspected among the crowds; and may obtain  tidings of evil intended me, when men would not speak, maybe,  before others whom they might judge my friends. He will be able to  bear messages, unsuspected; and may prove of great service to the  cause.\"    John found, at once, that there was nothing like discipline, or  regular duties, among the little band who constituted the bodyguard  of Josephus. They were simply men who, from affection for the  governor, and a hatred for those who, by their plots and  conspiracies, would undo the good work he was accomplishing, had  left their farms and occupations to follow and guard him.    Every Jewish boy received a certain training in the use of weapons,  in order to be prepared to fight in the national army, when the day  of deliverance should arrive; but beyond that, the Jews had no  military training, whatever. Their army would be simply a gathering  of the men capable of bearing arms, throughout the land--each ready  to give his life, for his faith and his country; relying, like  their forefathers, on the sword of the Lord and Israel, but without  the slightest idea of military drill, discipline, or tactics. Such  an army might fight bravely, might die nobly, but it could have  little chance of victory over the well-trained legions of imperial  Rome.    At noon, Josephus embarked in a galley with his little band of  followers--eight in number--and sailed across the lake to Tiberias.  Here they landed, and went up to the house in which Josephus always  dwelt, when in that city. His stay there was generally short,  Tarichea being his general abode--for there he felt in safety, the  inhabitants being devoted to him; while those of Tiberias were ever  ready to follow the advice of the disaffected, and a section were  eager for the return of the Romans, and the renewal of the business  and trade which had brought wealth to the city, before the troubles  began.    That evening, Josephus sent for John, and said:    \"I purpose, in two days, to go to Tarichea, where I shall spend the  Sabbath. I hear that there is a rumor that many of the citizens  have, privately, sent to King Agrippa asking him to send hither  Roman troops, and promising them a good reception. The men with me  are known, to many in the city, and would be shunned by my enemies,  and so would hear naught of what is going on; therefore, I purpose  to leave you here.    \"In the morning, go early to the house of Samuel, the son of  Gideon. He dwells in the street called that of Tarichea, for it  leadeth in the direction of that town. He is a tanner, by trade;  and you will have no difficulty in finding it. He has been here,  this evening, and I have spoken to him about you and, when you  present yourself to him, he will take you in. Thus, no one will  know that you are of my company.    \"Pass your time in the streets and, when you see groups of people  assemble, join yourself to them and gather what they are saying. If  it is ought that is important for me to know, come here and tell me  or, if it be after I have departed for Tarichea, bring me the news  there. It is but thirty furlongs distant.\"    John followed up the instructions given him, and was hospitably  received by Samuel the tanner.    In the course of the day, a number of the citizens called upon  Josephus and begged him, at once, to set about building walls for  the town, as he had already built them for Tarichea. When he  assured them that he had already made preparations for doing so,  and that the builders should set to work, forthwith, they appeared  satisfied; and the city remained perfectly tranquil until Josephus  left, the next morning, for Tarichea.        Chapter 4: The Lull Before The Storm.      The galley which carried Josephus from Tiberias was scarcely out of  sight when John, who was standing in the marketplace watching the  busy scene with amusement, heard the shout raised:    \"The Romans are coming!\"    At once, people left their business, and all ran to the outskirts  of the city. John ran with them and, on arriving there, saw a party  of Roman horsemen riding along, at no great distance. The people  began to shout loudly to them to come into the town, calling out  that all the citizens were loyal to King Agrippa and the Romans,  and that they hated the traitor Josephus.    The Romans halted, but made no sign of entering the town; fearing  that treachery was intended, and remembering the fate of their  comrades, who had trusted to Jewish faith when they surrendered the  towers of Hippicus, Phasaelus, and Mariamne. The movement, however,  spread through the city. The people assembled in crowds, shouting  \"Death to Josephus!\" and exclaiming for the Romans, and King  Agrippa. Such as were loyal to Josephus did not venture to raise  their voices, so numerous and furious were the multitude; and the  whole city was soon in open revolt, the citizens arming themselves  in readiness for war.    As soon as he saw the course which affairs were taking, John made  his way out of the town, and ran at the top of his speed to  Tarichea, where he arrived in a little over half an hour. He was  directed at once to the house of Josephus, who rose in surprise, at  the table at which he was seated, writing, at John's entry.    \"Scarcely had you left, my lord, than some Roman horsemen  approached near the town; whereupon the whole city rose in revolt,  shouting to them to enter and take possession, in the name of the  king, and breathing out threats against yourself. The Romans had  not entered, as I came away; but the populace were all in arms, and  your friends did not venture to lift up a voice. Tiberias has  wholly revolted to the Romans.\"    \"This is bad news, indeed,\" Josephus said, gravely. \"I have but the  seven armed men who accompanied me from Tiberias, here. All those  who were assembled in the city I bade disperse, so soon as I  arrived; in order that they might go to their towns, or villages,  for the Sabbath. Were I to send round the country, I could speedily  get a great force together but, in a few hours, the Sabbath will  begin; and it is contrary to the law to fight upon the Sabbath,  even though the necessity be great.    \"And yet, if the people of Tiberias march hither, we can hardly  hope to resist successfully; for the men of the town are too few to  man the full extent of the walls. It is most necessary to put down  this rising, before King Agrippa can send large numbers of troops  into Tiberias; and yet, we can do nothing until the Sabbath is  past.    \"Nor would I shed blood, if it can be avoided. Hitherto I have put  down every rising, and caused Sepphoris, Tiberias, and other cities  to expel the evildoers, and return to obedience, by tact--and by  the great force which I could bring against them--and without any  need of bloodshed. But this time, I fear, great trouble will come  of it; since I cannot take prompt measures, and the enemy will have  time to organize their forces, and to receive help from John of  Gischala and other robbers--to say nothing of the Romans.\"    Josephus walked up and down the room, in agitation, and then stood  looking out into the harbor.    \"Ah!\" he exclaimed suddenly, \"we may yet frighten them into  submission. Call in Joab.\"    When Joab entered Josephus explained to him, in a few words, the  condition of things at Tiberias; and then proceeded:    \"Send quickly to the principal men of the town, and bid them put  trusty men at each of the gates, and let none pass out. Order the  fighting men to man the walls, in case those of Tiberias should  come hither, at once. Then let one or two able fellows embark on  board each of the boats and vessels in the port, taking with them  two or three of the infirm and aged men. Send a fast galley across  to Hippos; and bid the fishermen set out, at once, with all their  boats, and join us off Tiberias. We will not approach close enough  to the city for the people to see how feebly we are manned but,  when they perceive all these ships making towards them, they will  think that I have with me a great army, with which I purpose to  destroy their city.\"    The orders were very quickly carried out. Josephus embarked, with  his eight companions, in one ship and, followed by two hundred and  thirty vessels, of various sizes, sailed towards Tiberias.    As they approached the town, they saw a great movement among the  population. Men and women were seen, crowding down to the  shore--the men holding up their hands, to show that they were  unarmed; the women wailing, and uttering loud cries of lamentation.    Josephus waited for an hour, until the ships from Hippos also came  up, and then caused them all to anchor off the town--but at such a  distance that the numbers of those on board could not be seen.

In the fifteenth century covers of leather  embossed with storied ornament were in use; ladies also frequently  employed their needles to construct, with threads of gold and silver, on  grounds of coloured silk, the cover of a favourite volume. In the  British Museum one is preserved of a later date--the work of our Queen  Elizabeth. In the sixteenth century small ornaments, capable of being  conjoined into a variety of elaborate patterns, were first used for  stamping the covers with gilding; the leather was stained of various  tints, and a beauty imparted to volumes which has not been surpassed by  the most skilful modern workmen.]    [Footnote 8: The Fuggers were a rich family of merchants, residing at  Augsburg, carrying on trade with both the Indies, and from thence over  Europe. They were ennobled by the Emperor Maximilian I.

The preceding article is honourable to literature, yet even a passion  for collecting books is not always a passion for literature.    The BIBLIOMANIA, or the collecting an enormous heap of books without  intelligent curiosity, has, since libraries have existed, infected weak  minds, who imagine that they themselves acquire knowledge when they keep  it on their shelves. Their motley libraries have been called the  _madhouses of the Human mind_; and again, _the tomb of books_, when the  possessor will not communicate them, and coffins them up in the cases of  his library. It was facetiously observed, these collections are not  without a _Lock on the Human Understanding_.[10]    The BIBLIOMANIA never raged more violently than in our own times. It is  fortunate that literature is in no ways injured by the follies of  collectors, since though they preserve the worthless, they necessarily  protect the good.[11]    Some collectors place all their fame on the _view_ of a splendid  library, where volumes, arrayed in all the pomp of lettering, silk  linings, triple gold bands, and tinted leather, are locked up in wire  cases, and secured from the vulgar hands of the _mere reader_, dazzling  our eyes like eastern beauties peering through their jalousies!    LA BRUYERE has touched on this mania with humour:--\"Of such a collector,  as soon as I enter his house, I am ready to faint on the staircase, from  a strong smell of Morocco leather. In vain he shows me fine editions,  gold leaves, Etruscan bindings, and naming them one after another, as if  he were showing a gallery of pictures! a gallery, by-the-bye, which he  seldom traverses when _alone_, for he rarely reads; but me he offers to  conduct through it! I thank him for his politeness, and as little as  himself care to visit the tan-house, which he calls his library.\"    LUCIAN has composed a biting invective against an ignorant possessor of  a vast library, like him, who in the present day, after turning over the  pages of an old book, chiefly admires the _date_. LUCIAN compares him to  a pilot, who was never taught the science of navigation; to a rider who  cannot keep his seat on a spirited horse; to a man who, not having the  use of his feet, would conceal the defect by wearing embroidered shoes;  but, alas! he cannot stand in them! He ludicrously compares him to  Thersites wearing the armour of Achilles, tottering at every step;  leering with his little eyes under his enormous helmet, and his  hunchback raising the cuirass above his shoulders. Why do you buy so  many books? You have no hair, and you purchase a comb; you are blind,  and you will have a grand mirror; you are deaf, and you will have fine  musical instruments! Your costly bindings are only a source of vexation,  and you are continually discharging your librarians for not preserving  them from the silent invasion of the worms, and the nibbling triumphs of  the rats!    Such _collectors_ will contemptuously smile at the _collection_ of the  amiable Melancthon. He possessed in his library only four  authors,--Plato, Pliny, Plutarch, and Ptolemy the geographer.    Ancillon was a great collector of curious books, and dexterously  defended himself when accused of the _Bibliomania_. He gave a good  reason for buying the most elegant editions; which he did not consider  merely as a literary luxury.[12] The less the eyes are fatigued in  reading a work, the more liberty the mind feels to judge of it: and as  we perceive more clearly the excellences and defects of a printed book  than when in MS.; so we see them more plainly in good paper and clear  type, than when the impression and paper are both bad. He always  purchased _first editions_, and never waited for second ones; though it  is the opinion of some that a first edition is only to be considered as  an imperfect essay, which the author proposes to finish after he has  tried the sentiments of the literary world. Bayle approves of Ancillon's  plan. Those who wait for a book till it is reprinted, show plainly that  they prefer the saving of a pistole to the acquisition of knowledge.  With one of these persons, who waited for a second edition, which never  appeared, a literary man argued, that it was better to have two editions  of a book rather than to deprive himself of the advantage which the  reading of the first might procure him. It has frequently happened,  besides, that in second editions, the author omits, as well as adds, or  makes alterations from prudential reasons; the displeasing truths which  he _corrects_, as he might call them, are so many losses incurred by  Truth itself. There is an advantage in comparing the first and  subsequent editions; among other things, we feel great satisfaction in  tracing the variations of a work after its revision. There are also  other secrets, well known to the intelligent curious, who are versed in  affairs relating to books. Many first editions are not to be purchased  for the treble value of later ones. The collector we have noticed  frequently said, as is related of Virgil, \"I collect gold from Ennius's  dung.\" I find, in some neglected authors, particular things, not  elsewhere to be found. He read many of these, but not with equal  attention--\"_Sicut canis ad Nilum, bibens et fugiens_;\" like a dog at  the Nile, drinking and running.    Fortunate are those who only consider a book for the utility and  pleasure they may derive from its possession. Students, who know much,  and still thirst to know more, may require this vast sea of books; yet  in that sea they may suffer many shipwrecks.    Great collections of books are subject to certain accidents besides the  damp, the worms, and the rats; one not less common is that of the  _borrowers_, not to say a word of the _purloiners_!

From his earliest  years his devotion to study was so great as to call for the  interposition of his father, to prevent his health being seriously  affected by it; he was described as \"intemperately studious.\" The  Jesuits of Metz gave him the free range of their college library; but  his studies led him to Protestantism, and in 1633 he removed to Geneva,  and devoted himself to the duties of the Reformed Church. Throughout an  honourable life he retained unabated his love of books; and having a  fortune by marriage, he gratified himself in constantly collecting them,  so that he ultimately possessed one of the finest private libraries in  France. For very many years his life passed peaceably and happily amid  his books and his duties, when the revocation of the Edict of Nantes  drove him from his country. His noble library was scattered at  waste-paper prices, \"thus in a single day was destroyed the labour,  care, and expense of forty-four years.\" He died seven years afterwards  at Brandenburg.]          LITERARY JOURNALS.
