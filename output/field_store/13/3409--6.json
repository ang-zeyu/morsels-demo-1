We will fight, but we will leave  it to the peasants to work. The Mamelukes will, however, in the first  place oppose the Franks. I love them not. They are the oppressors of  Egypt, but the lions of the desert are not more courageous. They are  proud of themselves, and believe themselves to be invincible. They will  not believe that the Franks can stand for a moment against them, and you  know that the night that the Franks landed, twenty Mamelukes rode out  against them, killed many, and brought in their heads in triumph. They  would not ask us to charge with them, but would deem it shame to ask for  aid in such an encounter, but they will be willing enough to accept our  help in cutting off the fugitives and in preventing others who may land  from spreading over the country.\"    \"Then you still feel sure that the Mamelukes will defeat the French?\"  Edgar said.    \"If it be the will of Allah, my son. The Mamelukes are not like the  people who defended Alexandria; they are warriors. We Arabs are brave,  we do not fear death; but when, from time to time, a tribe refuses to  pay its annual tribute, and a band of Mamelukes is sent against them,  truly the sons of the desert cannot withstand them in combat, even when  much more numerous, and are either destroyed or forced to make their  submission. These men regard themselves not as simple soldiers; it is an  army of emirs. Each has his two or three slaves to wait upon him, to  groom his horse and polish his arms. Their dresses are superb; their  arms and trappings are encrusted with gold and gems. Each carries his  wealth on his person, and there are few who cannot show a hundred pieces  of gold, while many can exceed that by ten times. It is true that they  are the oppressors of the people, and that Egypt has been drained of  its wealth for their support, yet we, who suffer from them, cannot but  feel proud of them. Are they not followers of the Prophet? They are men  like those whom the great Sultan Saladin led against the Christian hosts  who strove to capture Syria. We have tales how brave these were, and how  they rode, clad in steel from head to foot; and yet their bones whitened  the sands, and the true believers remained in possession of their lands.  The Mamelukes are men such as those were, and until I see the contrary I  shall not believe that they can be defeated by these Franks.\"    \"I hope that it may be so, sheik, and I doubt in no way their valour;  but it is the guns and the discipline of the French that will, I fear,  decide the conflict.\"          CHAPTER IV.    THE BATTLE OF THE PYRAMIDS.      The little party had ridden but a few miles when they saw a party of  five or six hundred Arab horse approaching. The sheik rode to meet them,  and after a short conversation with their leaders, returned.    \"We need go no farther for orders,\" he said. \"Mourad Bey, with 3000  Mamelukes and as many Janizaries, is within a few miles. Orders have  been sent to all the Arab tribes to hasten to oppose the march of the  enemy, and from all parts they are riding hither. Doubtless my brother,  who is the great sheik of the tribe of which we are a branch, is already  on his way to join him. We will at once ride and bring back all our  fighting men. The caravan can proceed without guard. Even a hostile  tribe would respect it at the present time, when all are engaged with  the enemy. We shall speedily overtake them. They would not have started  for an hour after we mounted, and cannot have gone many miles before we  come up with them.\"    Riding at full gallop, they soon overtook the caravan. The Arabs  received with shouts of satisfaction the orders their leader gave them  to retrace their steps. The old men, who were to proceed with the  caravan, were told that in the event of meeting with any parties  hastening towards Ramanieh, to tell them that the orders were to harass  the French as they advanced, and to say that all the sheik's fighting  men were already engaged in the work. Then, after a brief adieu to the  women, the Arabs rode at full gallop towards the river.    It was on the morning of the 29th of June that the French had taken  Alexandria, and on the 6th of July that they commenced their march.  General Dugua, with Kleber's division, had been taken by water to  Rosetta, which they occupied without difficulty, and with a large  flotilla of boats carrying provisions and stores, proceeded up the Nile  as far as Damanhour, at which town the main portion of the army arrived  after two days' painful march.    The French met with no resistance, owing to the fact that almost all  Bedouins near the coast had accepted Napoleon's tempting offers.  Nevertheless the troops were already discouraged. They had expected to  find a rich and fertile country, with palm-trees, lovely towns, and an  abundance of supplies of all kinds; but the Nile was now at its lowest,  and during the previous season it had not, as usual, overflowed its  banks and fertilized the country, consequently their march lay through a  sandy waste. The dust rose in clouds under their feet, the sun beat down  upon them; they suffered agonies of thirst, and many dropped from  exhaustion. And their disappointment was great when they found that,  instead of a rich and prosperous town, Damanhour was but a collection of  huts, affording neither means of subsistence nor booty of any kind.  Beyond the town large bands of Arabs had gathered, and the French army  were obliged to keep their ranks as they marched, to maintain a constant  watchfulness, and to travel at a slow pace in order that they might not  be separated from their baggage. General Muireur was seized with a  serious fever, the result of heat, thirst, and disappointment. He  mounted his horse on the morning after his arrival there, and rode out  beyond the outposts. He had gone but a short distance when a party of  Arabs, hiding among some bushes, sprang to their feet and poured in a  volley. He fell dead, and his body was stripped, and the Arabs, mounting  their horses, rode off before the outposts could arrive on the spot.    From this time the French dared not straggle. Every man who left the  ranks or lagged behind was killed. The Arabs were seldom seen, but they  lay concealed behind every inequality of the ground, every clump of  bushes. Occasionally, when there seemed to be an opening, a horde of  Arabs would sweep down, but these always recoiled from the steady fire  of the French infantry, and on the 10th of July the leading French  division, that commanded by Desaix, reached Ramanieh, on the Nile. Here,  after their terrible march, the French troops were seized with a  delirium of pleasure at seeing the verdure on the banks of the river,  and the water.    Disregarding all orders, they broke their ranks and rushed wildly to the  stream, into which thousands of them plunged in their uniforms. In the  cultivated fields great quantities of melons were found, affording a  delightful food, for since they had left Alexandria there had been  nothing to eat but the biscuits they had brought with them. Many paid  dearly for over-indulgence in the fruit, numbers being prostrated with  colic, while not a few died. Next day the army rested, the horses  needing the halt even more than the men, for they had not recovered from  the long confinement of the voyage when they started from Alexandria,  and the scanty supply of water, the clouds of dust, and the heaviness of  the passage across the deep sand had caused the death of a large number,  and had rendered the rest all but unserviceable.    They had learnt from the natives that Mourad, with a large number of  Mamelukes, was in front of them; and, indeed, on the day of their  arrival there they appeared in such force that the French formed in  order of battle outside the town. The Mamelukes rode backwards and  forwards in front of the line brandishing their weapons and threatening  a charge. A few rounds of artillery, however, speedily taught them the  power of the French guns, and they retired to Chebreisse, and the French  were not disturbed the next day. Here the army had the satisfaction of  being rejoined both by Dugua's division, with its flotilla, and by  another fleet of boats from Alexandria.    The Bedouins under the sheik had taken no part in the irregular  skirmishes. There were already as many Arabs as sufficed for cutting off  stragglers and compelling the French to march in military order, and the  sheik determined to hold his small party together until some opportunity  for a general encounter presented itself. Sometimes from the crest of  the sand-hills he and his followers watched the progress of the dark  masses of infantry.    \"They march very slowly,\" he said to Edgar. \"Why do they not go on  quicker?\"    \"I fancy that they are keeping pace with the baggage-train. Their  animals must be completely exhausted; and last night as we followed them  we came upon many dead horses. They know that their only safety is to  keep together, and I doubt not that the men are well-nigh as exhausted  as the animals. Even on horseback the heat is terrible, and although we  have our water-skins well-filled, I feel it very much, and of course men  on foot carrying their muskets and ammunition and knapsacks must feel it  very much more. I think they will go on faster after they have left  Ramanieh. They will have the Nile by their side, and will have no want  of water. The sand is firmer, too, and moreover they will be able to  obtain what they require from the boats.\"    On the evening of the 12th the French arrived at a village near  Chebreisse. At sunrise the next morning a battle began between the  flotilla and some Egyptian gun-boats that had come down from Cairo,  together with some batteries that had been established on the banks. The  Mamelukes sallied out from Chebreisse and charged down with such ardour  that it seemed as if they were about to hurl"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22245"],[0,"Steve and the Steam Engine (#11)"],[1,"fternoon.\"    \"I guess not, my dear,\" asserted Mrs. Tolman tranquilly. \"The car has  not been out of the garage until now. It must have been somebody else  you saw.\"    \"But it was your car--I am certain of it,\" persisted Mrs. Taylor.    \"Nonsense, Mary!\" laughed her husband. \"If the car has been in the  garage for a week how could it have been. You probably dreamed it. You  want a big red car so much yourself that you see them in your sleep.\"    \"No, I don't,\" protested Mrs. Taylor smiling good-humoredly at her  husband's banter.    \"Well, it may have been the Woodworths',\" Mrs. Tolman said with soothing  inspiration. \"They have a car like ours and Mrs. Woodworth came to call  while I was away. I'll ask the maid when I get home.\"    \"Y-e-s, it may have been the Woodworths',\" admitted Mrs. Taylor  reluctantly. It was plain, however, that she was unconvinced. \"But I  could have staked my oath that it was your car and Steve driving it,\"  she added carelessly.    \"Steve!\" Mr. Tolman ejaculated.    \"Oh, Steve never drives the car,\" put in Mrs. Tolman quickly. \"He is not  old enough to have a license yet, you know. That proves absolutely that  you were mistaken. But Stephen has run the car now and then when Havens  or his father were with him and he does very well at it. Some day he  will be driving it alone, won't you, son?\"    Bending forward she patted the boy's shoulder affectionately.    For an instant it seemed to Stephen as if every one in both cars must  have heard the _pound_, _pound_, _pound_ of his heart, as if everybody  from Coventry to Torrington must have heard it. Helplessly he stared at  Bud and Bud stared back. No words were needed to assure the two that  once again they were linked together by misdoing as they often had been  in the past. Bud looked anxiously toward his chum. He was a mischievous,  happy-go-lucky lad but in his homely, freckled face there was a winsome  manliness. Whatever the scrapes he got into through sheer love of fun it  was characteristic of him that he was always courageous enough to  confess to them. This was the first inkling he had had that Stephen had  not acquainted his father with the escapade of the previous week and  such a course was so at variance with his own frank nature that he was  aghast. Even now he waited, expecting his pal would offer the true  explanation of the mystery under discussion. He was ready to bear his  share of the blame,--bear more than belonged to him if he could lighten  Steve's sentence of punishment.    But the silence remained unbroken and the words he expected to hear did  not come. A wave of surprise swept over his face, surprise followed by a  growing scorn. It came to him in a flash that Stephen Tolman, the boy he  had looked up to as a sort of idol, was a coward, a coward! He was  afraid! It seemed impossible. Why, Steve was always in the thick of the  football skirmishes, never shrinking from the roughness of the game; he  was a fearless hockey player, a dauntless fighter. Coward was the last  name one would have thought of applying to him. And yet here he sat  cowering before the just result of his conduct. Bud was disappointed,  ashamed; he turned away his head but not before the wretched lad who  confronted him had caught in his glance the same contemptuous expression  he had seen in O'Malley's face.    Again Stephen was despised and knew it.    Nevertheless it would not do to betray his secret now. He must not show  that he was disconcerted. At every cost he must brazen out the affair.  He had gone too far to do otherwise. He wondered as he sat there if any  one suspected him; if his father, whose eye was as keen as that of an  eagle, had put together any of the threads of evidence. He might be  cherishing suspicions this very moment. It seemed impossible that he  shouldn't. If only he would speak and have it over! Anything would be  better than this suspense and uncertainty.    Mr. Tolman, however, maintained unwonted stillness and save for a  restless twitching of his fingers on the wheel of the car did not move.  If, thought Steve miserably, he could summon the nerve to look up, he  would know in a second from his father's face whether he was annoyed or  angry. At last the situation became unbearable and come what might he  raised his eyes. To his amazement his father was sitting there quite  serenely and so was everybody else, and the pause that seemed to him to  stretch into hours had glided off as harmlessly and as naturally as  other pauses. Apparently nobody was thinking about him, at least nobody  but Bud. With a sigh of relief his tense muscles relaxed. He could trust  Bud not to betray him. Once again he was safe!          CHAPTER VI    MR. TOLMAN'S SECOND YARN      For a day or two it seemed to Stephen that he would never cease to be  haunted by the shame and regret that followed his confiscation of the  big red touring car, or forget the good resolutions he made in  consequence; but within an incredibly short time both considerations  were thrust into the background by the rush of life's busy current.  School and athletics kept him occupied so that he had little leisure for  thought, and when he was in the house his father and mother smiled on  him as affectionately as before, which did much to restore to him his  normal poise. Long ago the boys had dropped the motor-car episode from  their memories and even Bud Taylor did not refer to it when he and Steve  came together to organize the hockey team for the approaching matches.    In the meantime the Thanksgiving holidays were drawing near and Mr.  Tolman suggested that he and Stephen should run over to New York for a  short visit. With the prospect of so much pleasure was it strange the  boy ceased to dwell on the unhappiness of the past or the possibility of  disaster in the future? The coming journey to New York was, to be sure,  no great novelty, for Stephen had often accompanied his father there on  business excursions; nevertheless such an outing was a treat to which he  looked forward as a sort of Arabian Nights adventure when for a short  time he stayed at a large hotel, ate whatever food pleased his fancy,  and went sight-seeing and to innumerable \"shows\" with his father. He was  wont to return to Coventry after the holiday with a throng of happy  memories and many a tale of marvels with which to entertain the boys.    Therefore when he and his father boarded the express Thanksgiving week  the lad was in the highest spirits.    \"Motor-cars are all very well,\" observed Mr. Tolman, as the porter  stowed their luggage away, \"but on a cold night like this a Pullman car  on a well-laid track is not to be despised. Eh, son?\"    \"I don't believe that I should want to travel to New York in a  touring-car at this time of year,\" agreed Stephen, smiling.    \"It is getting too late in the season to use an open car, anyway,\"  rejoined his father. \"I have delayed putting the car up because I have  been hoping we might have a little more warm weather; but I guess the  warm days have gone and the winter has come to stay now.\"    \"But there is no snow yet, Dad.\"    \"No. Still it is too chilly to drive with any comfort. The Taylors  shipped their car off last week and when I get home I shall do the  same.\"    Stephen looked disappointed.    \"I don't mind the cold when I'm wrapped up,\" he ventured.    \"You are not at the wheel, son,\" was his father's quick retort. \"The man  who is has his fingers nipped roundly, I can assure you. It is a pity we  have become so soft and shrink so from discomfort. Think what our  forbears endured when they went on journeys!\"    \"Neither the English stagecoaches nor Stephenson's railroad could have  been very comfortable, to judge from your descriptions of them,\" laughed  Steve.    \"Oh, don't heap all the blame on the English,\" his father replied. \"Our  own modes of travel in the early days were quite as bad as were those on  the other side of the water.\"    \"I wish you would tell me about the first American railroads,\" said the  boy. \"I was wondering about them the other night.\"    Mr. Tolman settled back in his seat thoughtfully.    \"America,\" he answered presently, \"went through a pioneer period of  railroading not unlike England's. Many strange steam inventions were  tried in different parts of the country, and many fantastic scientific  notions put before the public. Even previous to Watt's steam engine  Oliver Evans had astonished the quiet old city of Philadelphia by  driving through its peaceful streets in a queer steam vehicle, half  carriage and half boat, which he had mounted on wheels. Evans was an  ingenious fellow, a born inventor if ever there was one, who worked out  quite a few steam devices, some of which Watt later improved and  adopted. Then in 1812 John Stevens of New York got interested in the  steam idea and urged the commissioners of his state to build a railroad  between Lake Erie and Albany, suggesting that a steam engine not unlike  the one that propelled the Hudson River ferryboats could be used as  power for the trains. He was enthusiastic over the scheme but the New  York officials had no faith in the proposition, insisting that a steam  locomotive could never be produced that would grip the rails with  sufficient tension to keep cars on the track or draw a heavy load.\"    \"They'd better have given the plan a showdown,\" interrupted Steve  grimly.    \"No doubt that is true,\" admitted his father. \"However, it is very easy  for us, with our knowledge of science, to look back and laugh at their  mistakes. The world was very new in those days and probably had we lived  at that time and been equally ignorant of railroads and engines we  should have been just as cautious and unbelieving. The railroad was  still a young invention, you must remember, and to many persons it  seemed a rather mad, uncertain enterprise.\"    \"When was the first American railroad built?\" inquired the lad.    \"If by a railroad you mean something "]]]
