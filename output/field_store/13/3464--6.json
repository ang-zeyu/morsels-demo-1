Once a company went from Adam-on-Diamond and burned the house and  buildings belonging to my friend McBrier. Every article of  movable property was taken by the troops; he was utterly ruined.  This man was an honorable man, but mere good character, and  properly, had no effect on those who were working to build up the  Kingdom of God.    The Mormons brought in every article that could be used, and much  that was of no use or value was hauled to Adam-on-Diamond. Such  acts had the effect of arousing every Gentile in the three  counties of Caldwell, Carroll, and Daviess, as well as to bring  swarms of armed Gentiles from other localities.    Brother Lyman White, with three hundred men, was called to defend  Far West. I went with his command. The night White reached Far  West the battle of Crooked River was fought. Capt. David Patton,  alias Fear Not, one of the twelve apostles, had been sent out by  the Prophet with fifty men to attack a body of Missourians who  were camping on the Crooked River. Capt. Patton's men were nearly  all, if not every one of them, Danites. The attack was made just  before daylight in the morning. Fear Not wore a white blanket  overcoat, and led the attacking party. He was a brave, impulsive  man. He rushed into the thickest of the fight, regardless of  danger - really seeking it to show his men that God would shield  him from all harm. But he counted without just reason upon being  invincible, for a ball soon entered his body, passing through his  hips. The wound was fatal; but he kept on his feet and led his  men some time before yielding to the effects of the wound.    The Gentiles said afterwards that Capt. Patton told his men to  charge in the name of Lazarus:    \"Charge, Danites, charge!\"    As soon as he uttered the command which distinguished him they  gave the Danite captain a commission with powder and ball, and  sent him on to preach to the spirits.    In this battle several men were killed and wounded on both sides.  I do not remember all of the names of the Danites that were  killed, but I do remember that a man by the name of Banion was  killed, and one by the name of Holbrook wounded. I knew a man by  the name of Tarwater, on the Gentile side, that was cut up  fearfully. He was taken prisoner. The Danites routed the  Gentiles, who fled in every direction. The night being dark,  Holbrook and another Danite met and had a hand-to-hand fight, in  which they cut each other fearfully with their swords before they  discovered that they were friends.    After the Gentiles retreated the Mormons started for Far West,  taking Tarwater along as a prisoner. After traveling several  miles they halted in a grove of timber and released Tarwater,  telling him he was free to go home. He started off, and when he  was some forty yards from the Mormons Parley P. Pratt, then one  of the twelve apostles, stepped to a tree, laid his gun up by the  side of the tree, took deliberate aim, and shot Tarwater. He fell  and lay still. The Mormons went on and left him lying where he  fell.        CHAPTER V - THE MORMON WAR    After 1844 it was my habit to keep a journal, in which I wrote at  length all that I considered worthy of remembering. Most of my  journals, written up to 1860, were called for by Brigham, under  the plea that he wished the Church historian to write up the  Mormon history, and wanted my journals to aid him in making the  history perfect. As these journals contained many things not  intended for the public eye concerning the Mormon leaders and all  I knew of the Mountain Meadows Massacre, and what led to it, they  were never returned to me.    To proceed: I was at Far West when the Danites returned. They  brought Capt. Patton with them. He died that night, and his death  spread a mantle of gloom over the entire community. It robbed  many of their fond hope that they were invincible. If Fear Not  could be killed, who then might claim immunity from the missiles  of death hurled by Gentile weapons?    Up to this time I firmly believed what the Prophet and his  apostles had said on that subject. I had considered that I was  bullet-proof, that no Gentile ball could ever harm me or any  Saint, and I believed that a Danite could not be killed by  Gentile hands. I thought that one Danite would chase a thousand  Gentiles, and two could put ten thousand to flight.    Alas! my dream of security was over. One of our mighty men had  fallen, and by Gentile hands. My amazement at the fact was equal  to my sorrow for the death of the great warrior apostle. I had  considered that all the battles between Danites and Gentiles  would end like the election fight at Gallatin, and the only ones  to be injured would be the Gentiles.    We had been promised and taught by the Prophet and his Priesthood  that henceforth God would fight our battles, and I looked as a  consequence for a bloodless victory on the side of the Lord, and  that nothing but disobedience to the teachings of the Priesthood  could render a Mormon subject to injury from Gentile forces. I  believed as our leaders taught us, that all our sufferings and  persecutions were brought upon us by the all-wise God of Heaven  as chastisement to bring us together in unity of faith and strict  obedience to the requirements of the Gospel; and the feeling was  general that all our sufferings were the result of individual  sin, and not the fault of our leaders and spiritual guides.    We, as members of the Church, had no right to question any act of  our superiors; to do so wounded the Spirit of God, and would lead  to our own loss and confusion. Still, I was thunderstruck to hear  Joseph the Apostle say at the funeral of Capt. Patton that the  Mormons fell by the missiles of death the same as other men. He  also said that the Lord was angry with the people, for they had  been unbelieving and faithless; they had denied the Lord the use  of their earthly treasures, and placed their affections upon  worldly things more than upon heavenly things; that to expect  God's favor we must blindly trust him; that if the Mormons would  wholly trust in God the windows of heaven would be opened and a  shower of blessings sent upon the people; that all the people  could contain of blessings would be given as a reward for  obedience to the will of God as made known to mankind through the  Prophet of the ever-living God; that the Mormons, if faithful,  obedient, and true followers of the advice of their leaders,  would soon enjoy all the wealth of the earth; that God would  consecrate the riches of the Gentiles to the Saints.    This and much more he said to induce the people to obey the will  of the Priesthood. I believed all he said, for he supported it by  quotations from Scripture, and if I believed the Bible, as I did  most implicitly, I could not help believing in Joseph, the  prophet of God in these last days, Joseph declared that he was  called of God and given power and authority from heaven to do  God's will; that he had received the keys of the holy Priesthood  from the apostles Peter, James, and John, and had been dedicated,  set apart, and anointed as the prophet, seer, and revelator, and  sent to open the dispensation of the fullness of time, according  to the words of the apostles; that he was charged with the  restoration of the House of Israel, and to gather the Saints from  the four corners of the earth to the land of promise, Zion, the  Holy Land (Jackson County), and to the setting up of the Kingdom  of God preparatory to the second coming of Christ in the last  days. Every Mormon, true to his faith, believed as fully in  Joseph and his holy character as he did that God existed.    The Prophet Joseph was a most extraordinary man; he was rather  large in stature, some six feet two inches in height, well built,  though a little stoop-shouldered, with prominent and well-  developed features, a Roman nose, light chestnut hair, upper lip  full and rather protruding, chin broad and square, and an eagle  eye, and on the whole had something in his manner and appearance  that was bewitching and winning; his countenance was that of a  plain, honest man, full of benevolence and philanthropy and void  of deceit or hypocrisy. He was resolute and firm of purpose,  strong as most men in physical power, and all who saw were forced  to admire him, as he then looked and existed. In the sports of  the day, such as wrestling, he was over the average. Very few of  the Saints had the strength needed to throw the Prophet in a fair  tussle. In every gathering he was a welcome guest, and always  added to the amusement of the people, instead of dampening their  ardor.    During the time that we were camping at Adam-on-Diamond, waiting  to see what would be the result of the quarrel between our Church  and the Gentiles, one Sunday morning (it had rained heavily the  night before and the air was cold) the men were shivering over a  few firebrands, feeling out of sorts and quite cast down. The  Prophet came up while the brethren were moping around and caught  first one and then another and shook them up, and said:    \"Get out of here, and wrestle; jump, run, do anything but mope  around; warm yourselves up; this inactivity will not do for  soldiers.\"    The words of the Prophet put life and energy into the men. A ring  was soon formed, according to the custom of the people. The  Prophet stepped into the ring, ready for a tussle with any comer.  Several went into the ring to try their strength, but each one  was thrown by the Prophet, until he had thrown several of the  stoutest of the men present. Then he stepped out of the ring and  took a man by the arm and led him in to take his place, and so it  continued - the men who were thrown retiring in favor of the  successful one. A man would keep the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23580"],[0,"The Children's Bible (#11)"],[1," the men were sent away with their  asses. When they had gone out of the city, but were not yet far away,  Joseph commanded his steward, \"Follow after the men and when you  overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you returned evil for good? Why  have you stolen my silver cup, that from which my master drinks? You  have done wrong in so doing.'\"    So the steward overtook them and said these words to them. They said to  him, \"Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your  servants to do such a thing! Remember that we brought back to you from  the land of Canaan the money which we found in our sacks. Why then  should we steal silver or gold from your master's house? Let that one of  your servants with whom it is found die, and we will be my lord's  slaves.\" He said, \"Let it now be as you have said: he with whom it is  found shall be my slave; but you shall be innocent.\" Then each one  quickly took down his sack and opened it. The steward searched,  beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was  found in Benjamin's sack. Then they tore their clothes, and every man  loaded his ass and returned to the city.      JOSEPH'S FORGIVENESS OF HIS BROTHERS    [Illustration: _Joseph Converses with Judah, his Brother_    Painted by J. James Tissot]    When Judah and his brothers came back to Joseph's house, Joseph was  still there; and they threw themselves before him on the ground. Joseph  said to them, \"What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know  that a man like me can always tell where things are?\" Judah replied,  \"What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak or how shall we clear  ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants. See, both we  and he also with whom the cup was found are my lord's slaves.\" But  Joseph said, \"Far be it from me that I should do so! The man with whom  the cup was found shall be my slave; but you yourselves go up in peace  to your father.\"    Then Judah came close to him and said, \"Oh, my lord, let your servant, I  beg of you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger be  aroused against your servant, for you are even as Pharaoh. My lord asked  his servants, saying, 'Have you a father or a brother?' And we said to  my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a  little one. As his brother is dead, he is the only son of his mother who  is left; and his father loves him.' You said to your servants, 'Bring  him down to me, that I may see him.' But we said to my lord, 'The boy  cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father  would die.' Then you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest  brother comes down with you, you shall not see me again.'    \"When we went up to your servant, my father, we told him the words of my  lord; and our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food.' But we  said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we  will go; for we cannot see the man again unless our youngest brother is  with us.' Your servant, my father, said to us, 'You know that my wife  had two sons; and one went from me,' and I said, 'Surely he is torn in  pieces; and I have not seen him since. If you take this one also from  me, and harm come to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow  to the grave.' Now if I return to your servant, my father, and Benjamin  with whose life his heart is bound up is not with us, and he sees that  there is no boy, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray  hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave. For your  servant became responsible for the boy to my father, when I said, 'If I  do not bring him to you, then I will bear the blame before my father  forever.' Now, therefore, let me, instead of the boy, remain as a slave  to my lord, I beg of you; but let the boy go back with his brothers. For  how can I go back to my father, if the boy is not with me, lest I should  see the sorrow that would come upon my father?\"    Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who were standing  by him; so he cried out, \"Let every man leave me.\" So no Egyptian was  present while Joseph made himself known to his brothers. But he wept so  loudly that the Egyptians and Pharaoh's court heard.    And Joseph said to his brothers, \"I am Joseph. Is my father still  alive?\" But his brothers could not answer him, for they were too ashamed  to look him in the face. Then Joseph said to his brothers, \"Come near to  me, I beg of you.\" So they came near. He said, \"I am Joseph, your  brother, whom you sold into Egypt. Do not be troubled nor angry with  yourselves that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to save  your lives. For the famine has already been two years in the land, and  there are still five years in which there shall be neither ploughing nor  harvest. God sent me before you to save your lives through a great  deliverance and thus give you children on the earth. So now it is not  you who sent me here, but God. He has made me like a father to Pharaoh  and master of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt.    \"Go up quickly to my father and say to him, 'Your son Joseph says: God  has made me master of all Egypt. Come down to me without delay. You  shall live in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me with your  children and your grandchildren, with your flocks and your herds and all  that you have, so that you, with your household and all that you have,  may never want. There I will provide for you, for there will be five  more years of famine.' Now you and my brother Benjamin see that it is I  who am speaking to you. Tell my father all about my honor in Egypt and  what you have seen; and you must quickly bring him down here.\"    Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin  wept upon his neck. He also kissed all his brothers and wept upon them.  After that his brothers talked with him.      JOSEPH'S LOYALTY TO HIS FAMILY    The news that Joseph's brothers had arrived became known in Pharaoh's  palace; and it pleased Pharaoh and his servants greatly. Pharaoh said to  Joseph, \"Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts, go to the  land of Canaan, and take your father and your families and come to me,  and I will give you the best there is in the land of Egypt, and you  shall eat the best that the land can give. Now you are commanded to do  this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for  your wives, and bring your father and come. Also do not pay any  attention to your household goods, for the best of all there is in the  land of Egypt is yours.'\" And the sons of Jacob did as they were  commanded.    So Joseph gave them wagons, as Pharaoh ordered, and what was needed for  the journey. To each of them he gave a change of clothing, but to  Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of  clothing. To his father he sent this gift: ten asses loaded with the  best products of Egypt and ten asses loaded with grain and bread and  provisions for his father on the journey.    So he sent his brothers away, and, as they went, he said to them, \"See  that you do not quarrel on the journey!\" So they went up out of Egypt  and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father, and told him,  \"Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!\"  Then Jacob's heart stood still, for he could not believe them. But when  they told him all that Joseph had said to them and when he saw the  wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their  father revived, and he said, \"It is enough; Joseph my son is still  alive. I will go and see him before I die.\"    Then Jacob set out on his journey with all that he had. He first went to  Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. God  spoke to him in a vision by night and said, \"Jacob, Jacob.\" He answered,  \"Here am I.\" God said, \"I am God, the God of your father. Do not fear to  go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation. I  myself will go down with you into Egypt; I will surely bring you back  again; and Joseph shall close your dying eyes.\"    When Jacob left Beersheba, his sons carried him and their little ones  and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent. Jacob also sent  Judah before him to Joseph, that he might show him the way to Goshen.    When they came into the land of Goshen, Joseph made ready his chariot,  and went up to Goshen to meet Jacob his father. When he met him, Jacob  fell on his neck and wept there a long time.    Then Jacob said to Joseph, \"Now let me die, for I have seen your face  and know that you are still alive.\" But Joseph said to his brothers and  to his father's household, \"I will go up and tell Pharaoh and will say  to him, 'My brothers and my father's family who were in the land of  Canaan have come to me. Now the men are shepherds, for they have been  keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks and cattle and all  that they have.' When Pharaoh calls you, and asks, 'What is your  business?' you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of cattle  from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers.' Say this that  you may live in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is looked down  upon by the Egyptians.\"    Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh and said, \"My father and my  brothers with their sheep and cattle and all that they possess have come  from the land of Canaan; and now they are in the province of Goshen.\"  And he took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. Pharaoh  said to them, \"What is your business?\" They answered, \"Your servants are  shepherds, both we and our fathers.\" They also said to Pharaoh, \"We have  come to live in your country; because the famine is severe in the land  of Canaan, and there is no pasture for your servants' flocks. Now,  therefore, we beg of you, let your servants stay in the land of Goshen.\"  Then"]]]
