Notwithstanding the ruins, the view of the cathedral from the north-west  is very striking, and in some respects more remarkable than any other  (see p. 2). We have here the only external view of the whole length of  the #North Side Of The Nave#. With the exception of the clerestory  range, and, of course, the north transept, the first impression is not  that of a Norman building. The single broad light of the Norman  clerestory, with its adjacent round-headed lancets in the wall, remains  in each bay unaltered. Above these windows was once a battlement; but  Miller records, in 1834, that it was \"removed within the last sixty  years.\" The aisle battlement remains. The walls of the triforium were  raised, and the Norman windows, both of the aisle and triforium,  altered, in the Perpendicular period, the alterations having been begun  on the south side in 1469. All these windows now have ogee arches, and  are of three lights. The tracery is unimposing. About the middle of the  wall can be distinctly seen the marks of the door and covered way that  led from the cathedral to the Church of S. Cross. This church had been  erected in the early part of the fourteenth century, but (as has been  mentioned, p. 29), was found in 1566 to be too dilapidated for use, and  beyond repair. It was accordingly destroyed, and the lady-chapel  assigned, in lieu of it, to the parishioners for their parish church.  Either the fabric of this church must have been strangely neglected by  its custodians, or it must have been very inferior in merit of  construction to Walsingham's work, which was being erected at the same  time, if it could last no longer than about two hundred and thirty  years. Round the clerestory windows and arcading can be seen the billet  moulding; under the triforium parapet is a corbel table with billets;  below the triforium windows is a string-course consisting of little  double squares with a diagonal (sometimes called the hatched moulding),  a form of ornament not one of the most common. Good examples of it are  to be seen in Westminster Hall. In the sixth bay from the transept is a  tablet with the date 1662. This must be the time when some alterations  were made; but it can neither refer to the raising of the triforium  walls, nor to the building up the wall when the door to the destroyed  church was no longer needed. Between this point and the transepts can be  plainly seen the marks of the original Norman windows over the heads of  the existing Perpendicular ones.    #The Octagon# can be nowhere seen to better advantage than from this  point of view. Restored as a memorial to Dean Peacock, it has been  brought as nearly as possible to what Walsingham intended; for it is not  quite certain that he entirely completed his own design. The  quadrangular turrets, for instance, at the corners of the lantern, were  probably meant to be surmounted by pinnacles. These were included in  Scott's original designs for the restoration, but have not been erected.  Indeed, two of Bentham's views of the building represent pinnacles at  the corners of both octagon and lantern, while one view has them to  neither. It is certain also that there were slighter pinnacles designed  for the middle of the longer sides of the octagon. These have now been  built. The lantern has quite recovered its original beauty, after being  sadly mutilated and altered at various times. During the discussions  about the correct way of completing the lantern not a few persons  maintained that the true termination of the whole was a lofty, light,  open spire, and that if Walsingham never erected one, he must, at least,  have had one in contemplation. The examination of the interior  construction leaves no doubt whatever that no such fleche was ever  erected, and also that Walsingham intentionally completed the whole  without making any preparation for the addition of such a feature, a  preparation which he would beyond question have made had he thought a  spire was necessary to the completion of the work.    The octagon is not equilateral. The cardinal faces, being equal to the  inner breadth of the nave and transepts, are the longer. In all the  faces just below the open parapet are arcades of cinquefoiled arches,  some of them pierced for windows. The cardinal faces have each six such  arches, and the other faces only three. These shorter sides only have  large windows, the others abutting directly upon the roofs. These large  windows have exquisite tracery; they are all of four lights, with  transoms, and are beneath arches unusually acute for the Decorated  period. The windows in the lantern are new, Essex having destroyed the  original four-light windows and substituted poor ones of three lights  each.    The way in which the octagon and lantern combine in producing a  perfectly harmonious composition is in great part due to two points of  difference, points which very few observers detect. These are, firstly,  that the lantern is a regular octagon, having all its sides equal, in  this respect being unlike the stone octagon beneath it; and, secondly,  that the eight faces of the lantern are not parallel to the eight faces  of the octagon. The new windows of the lantern are similar to the large  ones below, but are not mere copies of them. The upper stage of the  lantern, above the roof as seen from within, was once a bell-chamber;  its lights are not, and never have been, glazed. The whole of the  lantern is of wood, covered with lead. Two flying buttresses rise from  the corners of the nave and transept aisles to the corbel table of the  clerestory range. There are also eight elegant flying buttresses, one to  each of the angles of the lantern. These are part of the new work, the  originals having long disappeared.    #The North Transept# retains its original Norman windows in the lower  stage of its western aisle, though we must remember that the  north-western angle of this transept fell down in 1699, and was  rebuilt[9] under the superintendence of Sir Christopher Wren. It is  said that an earthquake had occurred some few years before, and had  caused some damage which was not suspected at the time. However much we  may admire Wren's constructive genius, we cannot justify the incongruous  door in the north wall of the transept, for which we take it for granted  he was responsible. It is in the classical style, utterly out of keeping  with the architecture near. The arch and jambs of the Norman window  above it were replaced; but this again is spoilt by the insertion of  rude unadorned mullions. The corresponding window over the eastern aisle  is original and unaltered. The north end of the transept has also Norman  lights, larger than those below, on the second range; while above are  two large Perpendicular windows, each of three lights, with transoms. To  see the east wall of the transept we have to go round the lady-chapel.  Here both triforium and clerestory are in their original Norman  condition. The lower windows are Decorated.    It cannot but be regretted that the two large windows east and west of  #The Lady-Chapel# are not portions of the building as it stood at  first. That to the east, of seven lights, is known to have been inserted  by Bishop Barnet, who died in 1373. The authority for this is the  sacrist's roll for that year. The item is given in Dean Stubbs'  \"Historical Memorials,\" p. 147. The bishop's executors paid L20 \"for  making a certain window in the lady-chapel near the high altar in the  preceding year.\" The west window, of eight lights, is of somewhat later  date. Considering that the chapel was finished in 1349, and that there  is no reason to doubt that the east and west ends were adorned with fine  windows of the same character as those in the sides, it seems  extraordinary that within twenty-five years it should have been thought  worth while to alter the eastern end. Was the alteration made in  connection with the insertion of a grander reredos than had been at  first provided? This seems possible, as may be judged from the following  observations of the present Dean: \"It is evident from indications  supplied by the masonry of the central light of the east window, the  mullions of which are of unusual solidity, that the Reredos and East  window were originally combined in some structure, of which the chief  object was the large figure of S. Mary, often mentioned in the Rolls  of the Custos Capellae, and which must have occupied a canopied niche,  blocking up the whole of the middle light from sill to transom.\"[10] The  design of the east window is inelegant, the transom is heavy, and the  tracery in the large circle at the top spoils the effect of the window  as a whole.    [Illustration: THE CHOIR AND LADY-CHAPEL FROM THE NORTH-EAST.]    The west window, except for the central portion at the top and the heavy  mullions, is just like two of the side windows placed side by side. But  here again the vertical lines in the upper part harmonise ill with the  rest. There are some good niches at the west end above the window, but  there are no figures in them; and there are shallow arches on the  surface of the wall, on each side of the window as well as beneath it.  Above most of the niches are shields with heraldic bearings, twelve in  all. Among these are the coats of Edward the Confessor, the See of Ely,  Bishops Hotham, Montacute, Fordham, and perhaps Barnet.[11] One shield  has a cross, and one a lion between three helmets. The arms of the  monastery--three keys (said to have been adopted from Bishop Ethelwold  of Winchester)--occur four times, in three cases with initials beneath.  These initials are: A. W., which may certainly be assigned to Alan de  Walsingham; J. C.; and C. W. S. From the occurrence of Bishop Fordham's  arms we may conclude that this west end was reconstructed, or at least  that its reconstruction was completed, in his time (1388-1425).

Wander where you will  through every province of Canada, and almost every nook and corner of  the United States, you will find that the lawmaker has been there  before you, and has thrown over the birds the sheltering arm of  prohibitory statutes.  Legislators are not usually supposed to spend  much energy on drafting and enacting measures unless it is thought that  these will result in practical benefit to at least some portion of  their constituents.  Legislative bodies are not much given to  appropriating hundreds of thousands of dollars annually for the  enforcement of a law which is purely sentimental in its nature.  It is  clear, therefore, that our law makers regard the wild bird life as  {102} a great value to the country from the standpoint of dollars and  cents.    _Destructiveness of Insects._--If we go back a few years and examine  certain widely read publications issued by the United States Department  of Agriculture, we can understand more fully why our legislative bodies  have regarded so seriously the subject of bird protection.  In one of  the Year Books of the Department we read that the annual loss to the  cotton crop of the United States by insects amounts to sixty million  dollars.  We learn, too, that grasshoppers and other insects annually  destroy fifty-three million dollars' worth of hay and that two million  dollars' worth of cereals are each year eaten by our insect population.  In fact, we are told that one-tenth of all the cereals, hay, cotton,  tobacco, forests, and general farm products is the yearly tax which  insects levy and collect.  In some parts of the country  market-gardening and fruit-growing are the chief industries of the  people.  Now, when a vegetable raiser or fruit grower starts to count  up the cost of {103} his crops, one of the items which he must take  into consideration is the 25 per cent. of his products which goes to  feed the insects of the surrounding country.    Not all insects are detrimental to man's interests, but as we have just  seen the Government officially states that many of them are  tremendously destructive.  Any one who has attempted to raise apples,  for example, has made the unpleasant acquaintance of the codling moth  and the curculio.  Every season the apple raisers of the United States  expend eight and one-quarter million dollars in spraying, to discourage  the activities of these pests.  In considering the troubles of the  apple growers we may go even farther and count the twelve million  dollars' worth of fruit spoiled by the insects despite all the spraying  which has taken place.  Chinch bugs destroy wheat to the value of  twenty million dollars a year, and the cotton-boll weevil costs the  Southern planters an equal amount.    _Plagues of Insects._--Every now and then we read {104} of great  plagues of insects which literally lay waste a whole section of  country.  History tells of these calamities which have troubled the  civilized world from the days of Pharaoh to the present time.  During  the summer of 1912 there was a great outbreak of army worms in South  Carolina.  In innumerable millions they marched across the country,  destroying vegetation like a consuming fire.  In the year 1900 Hessian  flies appeared in great numbers in Ohio and Indiana, and before they  subsided they had destroyed absolutely two and one-half million acres  of the finest wheat to be found in the Middle West, and wheat land  dropped 40 per cent. in value.    Closing this Year Book, with its long tables of discouraging  statements, we may find more cheerful reading if we turn to another  Agricultural Department publication entitled, \"Some Common Birds and  Their Relation to Agriculture; Farmers Bulletin number Fifty-four.\"  We  need peruse only a few pages to become impressed with the fact that our  Government Biological Survey has made an {105} exhaustive and  exceedingly thorough investigation of the feeding habits of the wild  birds that frequent the fields and forests.  The reports of the  economic ornithologists herein given are almost as surprising as the  sad records given by the entomologists in the Year Book.  We learn that  birds, as a class, constitute a great natural check on the undue  increase of harmful insects, and furthermore that the capacity for food  of the average bird is decidedly greater in proportion than that of any  other vertebrate.    _Some Useful"]]]
