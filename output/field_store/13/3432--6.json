The late Mr. Hales, of Eton, had likewise a  very good library; and so had Dr. Cosin, late Bishop of Duresme [and  afterwards of Durham], a considerable part of which I had agreed with  him for myself during his exile abroad, as I can show under his own  hand; but his late daughter, since my Lady Garret, thought I had not  offered enough, and made difficulty in delivering them to me till near  the time of his Majesty's restoration, and after that the Dean, her  father, becoming Bishop of that opulent See, bestowed them on the  library there. But the Lord Primate Usher was inferior to none I have  named among the clergy for rare MSS., a great part of which, being  brought out of Ireland, and left his son-in-law, Sir Timothy Tyrill, was  disposed of to give bread to that incomparable Prelate during the late  fanatic war. Such as remained yet at Dublin were preserved, and by a  public purse restored and placed in the college library of that  city. . . . I forbear to name the late Earl of Bristol's and his  kinsman's, Sir Kenelm Digby's, libraries, of more pompe than intrinsic  value, as chiefly consisting of modern poets, romances, chymical, and  astrological books. . . . As for those of Sir Kenelm, the catalogue was  printed and most of them sold in Paris, as many better have lately been  in London. The Duke of Lauderdale's[27:A] is yet entire, choicely  bound, and to be sold by a friend of mine, to whom they are pawned; but  it comes far short of his relation's, the Lord Maitland's, which was  certainly the noblest, most substantial and accomplished library that  ever passed under the speare, and heartily it grieved me to behold its  limbs, like those of the chaste Hippolytus, separated and torn from that  so well chosen and compacted a body. The Earl of Anglesey's, and several  others since, by I know not what invidious fate, passed the same  fortune, to whatever influence and constellation now reigning malevolent  to books and libraries, which can portend no good to the future age.'    [Illustration: _Wotton House in 1840._]    It is interesting to note that of the several libraries enumerated by  Evelyn three have become, partly or wholly, public property. That of Dr.  John Moore, Bishop of Ely, was purchased after his death by George I.  for L6,000, and presented to the University of Cambridge, where it now  is.[27:B] Evelyn himself was, as will have been gathered, an ardent  book-collector. He began forming a library very early in life, whilst  that of his brother came to him by bequest. At the time of his death he  had a very extensive collection of books at Wotton, which has been  considerably augmented by his successors. In the early part of the  present century William Upcott, of the London Institution, drew up a  complete catalogue. Upcott's appearance on the scene synchronized with  the disappearance of a number of volumes from the Evelyn Library; it has  been suggested that Lady Evelyn presented them to him 'or something of  that sort,' although the circumstance has never been officially  explained. Certain it is that a large number of books formerly in the  possession of the diarist have at times appeared in the auction-room.  The most important which occurred during the last few years are two  beautifully-written MSS., the work of Richard Hoare, one having the  title 'Instructions Oeconomiques,' 1648, with a dedication 'To the  present mistress of my youth, the hopeful companion of my riper years,  and the future nurse of my old age, Mrs. May Evelyn, my deare wife,'  etc. The second was a book of Private Devotions, 1650. Evelyn was also  unfortunate in his lifetime, inasmuch as the Duke of Lauderdale 'came to  my house, under pretence of a visit,' but in reality to borrow 'for a  few days' certain valuable MSS., which this aristocratic thief never  returned. So, too, he lent Burnet a quantity of MS. material for his  'History of the Reformation,' which, like other borrowed books, never  came back. A large number of first editions of the works of J. Evelyn,  together with some books from his library, illustrated with his  autograph notes, occurred in the sale of the library of the late Arthur  Davis, of Deptford and East Farleigh, July, 1857, many of which were  doubtless purloined at some time or other.    [Illustration: _Magdalen College, Oxford._]    Of all the seventeenth-century book-collectors, perhaps the most  interesting is that other diarist, Samuel Pepys. Samuel was not a man of  great learning, but his wit, his knowledge of the world, and his  humanity were unbounded. He welcomed almost anything in the shape of a  book, from a roguish French novel to a treatise on medals, from a loose  Restoration play to a maritime pamphlet, and from lives of the saints to  books on astrology or philosophy. Not a great man, perhaps, but one of  the most delightful and entertaining that one could wish. The  Secretary's 'Diary' is full of allusions to men and events of bookish  interest, and gives frequent illustrations of his amiable passion for  book-collecting. Fortunately, we have not to grope in the dark to get an  accurate portrait of the genial Samuel as a book-collector, for his  entire library is preserved, almost in the same state as he left it, at  Magdalen College, Oxford, 'as curious a medley of the grave and gay' as  any person of catholic tastes could wish for. The library consists of  almost 3,000 volumes, preserved in eleven mahogany bookcases. The books  are all arranged in double rows, the small ones in front being  sufficiently low to permit of the titles of the back row of larger ones  being easily read. The library is a remarkably accurate reflection of  the tastes of the founder. In addition to what is termed ordinary useful  books, there are many rarities, including no less than nine Caxtons, and  several from the press of Wynkyn de Worde and Pynson. The celebrated  collection of ballads, commenced by Selden and continued by Pepys, is  second only in importance to the famous Roxburghe collection now in the  British Museum. The manuscripts of various kinds form a very valuable  part of this celebrated collection.    [Illustration: _Sir Hans Sloane's Monument._]    John Bagford, the biblioclast (1675-1716), also finishes us, like  Evelyn, with a list of book-collectors who were contemporaneous with  him. Besides Bishop Moore, already mentioned, there were Sir Hans  Sloane, Lords Carbery (Duke of Kent), Pembroke, Somers, Sunderland, and  Halifax. Among the commoners who emulated their 'betters' were Messrs.  Huckle, Chichely, Bridges, Walter Clavell, Rawlinson, Slaughter, Topham,  Wanley, Captain Hatton, 'Right Hon. Secretary Harley,' and Dr. Salmon,  whose collection is said to have consisted of 1,700 folios. Edwards, in  his most valuable work on libraries, mentions yet a third list, which is  anonymous, and is apparently almost contemporaneous with Bagford's. The  list is introduced with the remark that 'the laudable emulation which is  daily increasing amongst the nobility of England, vying with each other  in the curiosities and other rich furniture of their respective  libraries, gives cheerful hope of having the long-hidden monuments of  ancient times raised out of their present dust and rubbish,' and then  makes special mention of the libraries of the Duke of Kent, Lords Derby,  Denbigh, Longueville, Willoughby de Broke, Sunderland, Somers, and  Halifax.    When good Mr. Evelyn described Sir Kenelm Digby's library as 'of more  pomp than intrinsic value,' and as 'chiefly consisting of modern poets,  romances, chemical and astrological books,' he did not contemplate the  future possibility of such despised trifles becoming fashionable and in  greater request than the accumulations of the collectors to whom the  classics were daily food. As Edwards has pointed out, the portion which  Digby gave to the Bodleian was in reality the fruit of the researches of  his tutor, Thomas Allen. The portion which was of his own collecting,  and consequently the only portion which accurately mirrored his own  tastes, he took with him to France when driven into exile. When he died  there, it apparently passed into the possession of Digby, Earl of  Bristol, on whose account it was sold in London in 1680, fifteen years  after its owner's death. The catalogue enumerated 3,878 items, of which  69 were manuscripts, the total of the sale being L904 4s.    Among the most famous of the seventeenth-century collectors were the two  brothers Francis, Baron Guilford, Lord Keeper (1637-1685), and Dr. John  North, master of Trinity College (1645-1683). Of these two there are  some very entertaining facts in Roger North's 'Lives of the Norths'  (1742-44). Dr. John North, we are told, 'very early in his career began  to look after books and to lay the foundation of a competent library  . . . buying at one lift a whole set of Greek classics in folio, in best  editions. This sunk his stock [of money] for the time; but afterwards  for many years of his life all that he could (as they say) rap or run  went the same way. But the progress was small, for such a library as  he desired, compared with what the pittance of his stock would  purchase, allowing many years to the gathering, was of desperate  expectation. . . . He courted, as a fond lover, all best editions,  fairest characters, best-bound and preserved. . . . He delighted in the  small editions of the classics by Seb. Gryphius, and divers of his  acquaintance, meeting with any of them, bought and brought them to him,  which he accepted as choice presents, although, perhaps, he had one or  two of them before. . . . His soul was never so staked down as in an old  bookseller's shop. . . . He was for the most part his own factor, and  seldom or never bought by commission, which made him lose time in  turning over vast numbers of books, and he was very hardly pleased at  last. I have borne him company in shops for many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22608"],[0,"A Book for All Readers (#11)"],[1," any well-used library,  there will not remain ten which have not had to be re-bound or repaired  at the end of twenty or thirty years. Heavy volumes bound in calf or  half-calf leather will break by their own weight on the shelves, without  any use at all; and smaller volumes are sure to have their brittle joints  snapped asunder by handling sooner or later--it is only a question of  time.    Next comes Russia leather, which is very thick and strong, being made of  the hides of cattle, colored, and perfumed by the oil of birch, and made  chiefly in Russia. The objections to this leather are its great cost, its  stiffness and want of elasticity, and its tendency to desiccate and lose  all its tenacity in the dry or heated atmosphere of our libraries. It  will break at the hinges--though not so readily as calf.    Lastly, we have the morocco leather, so called because it was brought  from Morocco, in Africa, and still we get the best from thence, and from  the Mediterranean ports of the Levant--whence comes another name for the  best of this favorite leather, \"Levant morocco,\" which is the skin of the  mountain goat, and reckoned superior to all other leathers. The  characteristics of the genuine morocco, sometimes called Turkey morocco,  having a pebbled grain, distinguishing it from the smooth morocco, are  its toughness and durability, combined with softness and flexibility. It  has a very tenacious fibre, and I have never found a real morocco binding  broken at the hinges. The old proverb--\"there is nothing like  leather\"--is pregnant with meaning, and especially applies to the best  morocco. As no material yet discovered in so many ages can take the  place of leather for foot-wear and for harness, such is its tenacity and  elasticity--so for book coverings, to withstand wear and tear, good  leather is indispensable. There are thoroughly-bound books existing which  are five centuries old--representing about the time when leather began to  replace wood and metals for binding. The three great enemies of books are  too great heat, too much moisture, and coal gas, which produces a  sulphurous acid very destructive to bindings, and should never be used in  libraries. From the dangers which destroy calf and Russia leather,  morocco is measurably free.    As to color, I usually choose red for books which come to binding or  rebinding, for these reasons. The bulk of every library is of dark and  sombre color, being composed of the old-fashioned calf bindings, which  grow darker with age, mingled with the cloth bindings of our own day, in  which dark colors predominate. Now the intermixture of red morocco, in  all or most of the newly bound books, relieves the monotony of so much  blackness, lights up the shelves, and gives a more cheerful aspect to the  whole library. Some there are who insist upon varying the colors of  bindings with the subjects of the books--and the British Museum Library  actually once bound all works on botany in green, poetry in yellow,  history in red, and theology in blue; but this is more fanciful than  important. A second reason for preferring red in moroccos is that, being  dyed with cochineal, it holds its color more permanently than any  other--the moroccos not colored red turning to a dingy, disagreeable  brown after forty or fifty years, while the red are found to be fast  colors. This was first discovered in the National Library of France, and  ever since most books in that great collection have been bound in red. A  celebrated binder having recommended this color to a connoisseur who was  having fine morocco binding done, instanced the example of the Paris  Library, whose books, said he, are \"mostly red,\" to which the amateur  replied that he hoped they were.    Add to the merits of morocco leather the fact that it is not easily  scratched nor stained, that it is very tough in wear, and resists better  than any other the moisture and soiling of the hands--and we have a  material worthy of all acceptance.    In half-binding chosen for the great majority of books because it is much  cheaper than full leather, the sides are covered with muslin or with some  kind of colored paper--usually marble. The four corners of every book,  however, should always be protected by leather or, better still, by  vellum, which is a firmer material--otherwise they will rapidly wear off,  and the boards will break easily at their corners. As to the relative  merits of cloth and paper for the sides of books, cloth is far more  durable, though it costs more. Paper becomes quickly frayed at the edges,  or is liable to peel where pasted on, though it may be renewed at small  expense, and may properly be used except upon the much-read portion of  the library. The cloth or paper should always harmonize in color with the  leather to which it is attached. They need not be the same, but they  should be of similar shade.    One more reason for preferring morocco to other leathers is that you can  always dispense with lettering-pieces or patches in gilding the titles on  the back. All light-colored bindings (including law calf) are open to the  objection that gold lettering is hardly legible upon them. Hence the  necessity of stamping the titles upon darker pieces of leather, which are  fastened to the backs. These lettering-pieces become loose in over-heated  libraries, and tend continually to peel off, entailing the expense of  repairing or re-lettering. Every morocco bound book can be lettered  directly upon the leather. Bock is made of the skin of the Persian sheep,  and is called Persian in London. It is a partially unsuccessful imitation  of morocco, becoming easily abraded, like all the sheep-skin leathers,  and although it is to be had in all colors, and looks fairly handsome for  a time, and is tougher than skiver (or split sheep-skin), the books that  are bound in it will sooner or later become an eyesore upon the shelves.  A skin of Persian leather costs about one-third the price of genuine  morocco, or goat. But the actual saving in binding is in a far less  ratio--the difference being only six to eight cents per volume. It is  really much cheaper to use morocco in the first place, than to undergo  all the risks of deterioration and re-binding.    Of the various imitations of leather, or substitutes for it, we have  leatherette, leather-cloth, duck, fibrette, feltine, and buckram. Buckram  and duck are strong cotton or linen fabricks, made of different colors,  and sometimes figured or embossed to give them somewhat the look of  leather. Hitherto, they are made mostly in England, and I have learned of  no American experience in their favor except the use of stout duck for  covering blank books and binding newspapers. The use of buckram has been  mostly abandoned by the libraries. Morocco cloth is American, but has no  advantage over plain muslin or book cloth, that I am aware of.  Leatherette, made principally of paper, colored and embossed to simulate  morocco leather, appears to have dropped out of use almost as fast as it  came in, having no quality of permanence, elegance, or even of great  cheapness to commend it. Leatherette tears easily, and lacks both  tenacity and smoothness.    Both feltine and fibrette are made of paper--tear quickly, and are unfit  for use on any book that is ever likely to be read. All these imitations  of leather are made of paper as their basis, and hence can never be  proper substitutes for leather.    All torn leaves or plates in books should be at once mended by pasting a  very thin onion-skin paper on both sides of the torn leaf, and pressing  gently between leaves of sized paper until dry.    Corners made of vellum or parchment are more durable than any leather.  When dry, the parchment becomes as hard almost as iron and resists falls  or abrasion. To use it on books where the backs are of leather is a  departure from the uniformity or harmony of style insisted upon by many,  but in binding books that are to be greatly worn, use should come before  beauty.    In rebinding, all maps or folded plates should be mounted on thin canvas,  linen, or muslin, strong and fine, to protect them from inevitable  tearing by long use. If a coarse or thick cloth is used, the maps will  not fold or open easily and smoothly.    The cutting or trimming of the edges of books needs to be watched with  jealous care. Few have reflected that the more margin a binder cuts off,  the greater his profit on any job, white paper shavings having a very  appreciable price by the pound. A strictly uncut book is in many American  libraries a rarity. And of the books which go a second time to the  binder, although at first uncut, how many retain their fair proportions  of margin when they come back? You have all seen books in which the text  has been cut into by the ruthless knife-machine of the binder. This is  called \"bleeding\" a book, and there are no words strong enough to  denounce this murderous and cold-blooded atrocity. The trimming of all  books should be held within the narrowest limits--for the life of a book  depends largely upon its preserving a good margin. Its only chance of  being able to stand a second rebinding may depend upon its being very  little trimmed at its first. If it must be cut at all, charge your binder  to take off the merest shaving from either edge.    Every new book or magazine added to the library, if uncut, should be  carefully cut with a paper-knife before it goes into the hands of any  reader. Spoiled or torn or ragged edges will be the penalty of neglecting  this. You have seen people tear open the leaves of books and magazines  with their fingers--a barbarism which renders him who would be guilty of  it worthy of banishment from the resorts of civilization. In cutting  books, the leaves should always be held firmly down--and the knife  pressed evenly through the uncut leaves to the farthest verge of the  back. Books which are cut in the loose fashion which"]]]
