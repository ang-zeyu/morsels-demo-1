But they were natives of  A_dh_irbayjan, accustomed to the cold, and they could not endure the local  heat. Furthermore, this was during our early days in Akka, when the air  was noxious, and the water unwholesome in the extreme. They both fell ill  of a chronic, high fever. They bore it cheerfully, with amazing patience.  During their days of illness, despite the assault of the fever, the  violence of their ailment, the raging thirst, the restlessness, they  remained inwardly at peace, rejoicing at the Divine glad tidings. And at a  time when they were offering thanks with all their heart, they hurried  away from this world and entered the other; they escaped from this cage  and were released into the garden of immortality. Upon them be the mercy  of God, and may He be well pleased with them. Unto them be salutations and  praise. May God bring them into the Realm that abides forever, to delight  in reunion with Him, to bask in the Kingdom of Splendors. Their two  luminous tombs are in Akka.            HAJI 'ABDU'R-RAHIM-I-YAZDI      Haji 'Abdu'r-Rahim of Yazd was a precious soul, from his earliest years  virtuous and God-fearing, and known among the people as a holy man,  peerless in observing his religious duties, mindful as to his acts. His  strong religious faith was an indisputable fact. He served and worshiped  God by day and night, was sound, mild, compassionate, a loyal friend.    Because he was fully prepared, at the very moment when he heard the  summons from the Supreme Horizon--heard the drumbeats of \"Am I not your  Lord?\"--he instantly cried out, \"Yea, verily!\" With his whole being, he  became enamored of the splendors shed by the Light of the World. Openly  and boldly he began to confirm his family and friends. This was soon known  throughout the city; to the eyes of the evil 'ulamas, he was now an object  of hate and contempt. Incurring their wrath, he was despised by those  creatures of their own low passions. He was molested and harassed; the  inhabitants rioted, and the evil 'ulamas plotted his death. The government  authorities turned on him as well, hounded him, even subjected him to  torture. They beat him with clubs, and whipped him. All this went on, by  day and night.    He was forced, then, to abandon his home and go out of the city, a  vagrant, climbing the mountains, crossing over the plains, until he came  to the Holy Land. But so weak he was, and wasted away, that whoever saw  him thought he was breathing his last; when he reached Haifa, Nabil of  Qa'in hurried to Akka, and desired me to summon the Haji at once, because  he was in his death agony and failing fast.    \"Let me go to the Mansion,\" I said, \"and ask leave.\" \"It would take too  long,\" he said. \"And then 'Abdu'r-Rahim will never see Akka. I long for  him to have this bounty; for him at least to see Akka, and die. I beg of  You, send for him at once!\"    Complying with his wish, I summoned 'Abdu'r-Rahim. When he came, I could  hardly detect in him a whisper of life. At times he would open his eyes,  but he spoke no word. Still, the sweet savors of the Most Great Prison  restored the vital spark, and his yearning to meet Baha'u'llah breathed  life into him again. I looked in on him the next morning and found him  cheerful and refreshed. He asked permission to attend upon Baha'u'llah.  \"It all depends,\" I answered, \"on whether He grants you leave. God  willing, you shall be singled out for this cherished gift.\"    A few days later, permission came, and he hastened to the presence of  Baha'u'llah. When 'Abdu'r-Rahim entered there, the spirit of life was  wafted over him. On his return, it was clear that this Haji had become a  different Haji entirely: he was in the bloom of health. Nabil was  dumbfounded, and said: \"How life-giving, to a true believer, is this  prison air!\"    For some time, 'Abdu'r-Rahim lived in the neighborhood. He spent his hours  remembering and praising God; he chanted prayers, and carefully attended  to his religious duties. Thus he saw few people. This servant paid special  attention to his needs, and ordered a light diet for him. But it all came  to an end with the Supreme Affliction, the ascension of Baha'u'llah. There  was anguish then, and the noise of loud weeping. With his heart on fire,  his eyes raining tears, he struggled weakly to move about; so his days  went by, and always, he longed to make his exit from this rubbish heap,  the world. At last he broke away from the torment of his loss, and hurried  on to the Realm of God, and came to the assemblage of Divine splendor in  the Kingdom of Lights.    Unto him be salutations and praise, and mercy ineffable. May God scatter  on his resting-place rays from the mysterious Realm.            HAJI 'ABDU'LLAH NAJAF-ABADI      Once he had become a believer, Haji 'Abdu'llah left his native Persia,  hastened to the Holy Land, and under the sheltering grace of Baha'u'llah  found peace of heart. He was a man confident, steadfast and firm; certain  of the manifold bounties of God; of an excellent disposition and  character.    He spent his days in friendly association with the other believers. Then  for a while he went to _Gh_awr, near Tiberias, where he farmed, both  tilling the soil and devoting much of his time to supplicating and  communing with God. He was an excellent man, high-minded and unsullied.    Later he returned from _Gh_awr, settled near Baha'u'llah in Junayna, and  came often into His presence. His eyes were fixed on the Abha Kingdom;  sometimes he would shed tears and moan, again he would rejoice, glad  because he had achieved his supreme desire. He was completely detached  from all but God, happy in God's grace. He would keep a vigil most of the  night, remaining in a state of prayer. Then death came at the appointed  hour, and in the shadowing care of Baha'u'llah he ascended, hurried away  from this world of dust to the high Firmament, soared upward to the secret  land. Unto him be salutations, mercy and praise, in the neighborhood of  his exalted Lord.            MUHAMMAD-HADIY-I-SAHHAF      Yet one more among those who emigrated and came to settle near Baha'u'llah  was the bookbinder, Muhammad-Hadi. This noted man was from Isfahan, and as  a binder and illuminator of books he had no peer. When he gave himself up  to the love of God he was alert on the path and fearless. He abandoned his  home and began a dreadful journey, passing with extreme hardship from one  country to another until he reached the Holy Land and became a prisoner.  He stationed himself by the Holy Threshold, carefully sweeping it and  keeping watch. Through his constant efforts, the square in front of  Baha'u'llah's house was at all times swept, sprinkled and immaculate.    Baha'u'llah would often glance at that plot of ground, and then He would  smile and say: \"Muhammad-Hadi has turned the square in front of this  prison into the bridalbower of a palace. He has brought pleasure to all  the neighbors and earned their thanks.\"    When his sweeping, sprinkling and tidying was done, he would set to work  illuminating and binding the various books and Tablets. So his days went  by, his heart happy in the presence of the Beloved of mankind. He was an  excellent soul, righteous, true, worthy of the bounty of being united with  his Lord, and free of the world's contagion.    One day he came to me and complained of a chronic ailment. \"I have  suffered from chills and fever for two years,\" he said, \"The doctors have  prescribed a purgative, and quinine. The fever stops a few days; then it  returns. They give me more quinine, but still the fever returns. I am  weary of this life, and can no longer do my work. Save me!\"    \"What food would you most enjoy?\" I asked him. \"What would you eat with  great appetite?\"    \"I don't know,\" he said. Jokingly, I named off the different dishes. When  I came to barley soup with whey (a_sh_-i-ka_sh_k), he said, \"Very good!  But on condition there is braised garlic in it.\"    I directed them to prepare this for him, and I left. The next day he  presented himself and told me: \"I ate a whole bowlful of the soup. Then I  laid my head on my pillow and slept peacefully till morning.\"    In short, from then on he was perfectly well for about two years.    One day a believer came to me and said: \"Muhammad-Hadi is burning up with  fever.\" I hurried to his bedside and found him with a fever of 42  Centigrade. He was barely conscious. \"What has he done?\" I asked. \"When he  became feverish,\" was the reply, \"he said that he knew from experience  what he should do. Then he ate his fill of barley soup with whey and  braised garlic; and this was the result.\"    I was astounded at the workings of fate. I told them: \"Because, two years  ago, he had been thoroughly purged and his system was clear; because he  had a hearty appetite for it, and his ailment was fever and chills, I  prescribed the barley soup. But this time, with the different foods he has  had, with no appetite, and especially with a high fever, there was no  reason to diagnose the previous chronic condition. How could he have eaten  the soup!\" They answered, \"It was fate.\" Things had gone too far;  Muhammad-Hadi was past saving.    He was a man short of stature, lofty of station and mind. His heart was  pure, his soul luminous. During all those days when he served the Holy  Threshold, he was loved by the friends and favored by God. From time to  time, a smile on His lips, the Blessed Beauty would speak to him,  expressing kindness and grace.    Muhammad-Hadi was loyal always, and he accounted all things other than  God's good pleasure as fiction and fable, nothing more. Blessed is he for  this gift bestowed upon him, glad tidings to him for the place to which he  shall be led; may it do him good, this wine-cup tempered at the camphor  fountain, and may all his strivings meet "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19282"],[0,"The Promised Day Is Come (#11)"],[1," thee, thou wilt, assuredly, be derogating from that great and priceless  honor. Return, then, and cleave wholly unto God, and cleanse thine heart  from the world and all its vanities, and suffer not the love of any  stranger to enter and dwell therein. Not until thou dost purify thine  heart from every trace of such love can the brightness of the light of God  shed its radiance upon it, for to none hath God given more than one heart.  This, verily, hath been decreed and written down in His ancient Book. And  as the human heart, as fashioned by God, is one and undivided, it  behooveth thee to take heed that its affections be, also, one and  undivided. Cleave thou, therefore, with the whole affection of thine  heart, unto His love, and withdraw it from the love of anyone besides Him,  that He may aid thee to immerse thyself in the ocean of His unity, and  enable thee to become a true upholder of His oneness....            LET THE OPPRESSOR DESIST      \"Let thine ear be attentive, O King, to the words We have addressed thee.  Let the oppressor desist from his tyranny, and cut off the perpetrators of  injustice from among them that profess thy faith. By the righteousness of  God! The tribulations We have sustained are such that any pen that  recounteth them cannot but be overwhelmed with anguish. No one of them  that truly believe and uphold the unity of God can bear the burden of  their recital. So great have been Our sufferings that even the eyes of our  enemies have wept over Us, and beyond those of every discerning person.  And to all these trials have We been subjected, in spite of Our action in  approaching thee, and in bidding the people to enter beneath thy shadow,  that thou mightest be a stronghold unto them that believe in and uphold  the unity of God.    \"Have I, O King, ever disobeyed thee? Have I, at any time, transgressed  any of thy laws? Can any of thy ministers that represent thee in 'Iraq  produce any proof that can establish My disloyalty to thee? No, by Him Who  is the Lord of all worlds! Not for one short moment did We rebel against  thee, or against any of thy ministers. Never, God willing, shall We revolt  against thee, though We be exposed to trials more severe than any We  suffered in the past. In the daytime and in the night season, at even and  at morn, We pray to God on thy behalf, that He may graciously aid thee to  be obedient unto Him and to observe His commandments, that He may shield  thee from the hosts of the evil ones. Do, therefore, as it pleaseth thee,  and treat Us as befitteth thy station and beseemeth thy sovereignty. Be  not forgetful of the law of God in whatever thou desirest to achieve, now  or in the days to come. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds!\"    Moreover, in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, is this vehement apostrophe to  Constantinople: \"O Spot that art situate on the shores of the two seas!  The throne of tyranny hath, verily, been stablished upon thee, and the  flame of hatred hath been kindled within thy bosom, in such wise that the  Concourse on high and they who circle around the Exalted Throne have  wailed and lamented. We behold in thee the foolish ruling over the wise,  and darkness vaunting itself against the light. Thou art indeed filled  with manifest pride. Hath thine outward splendor made thee vainglorious?  By Him Who is the Lord of mankind! It shall soon perish, and thy daughters  and thy widows and all the kindreds that dwell within thee shall lament.  Thus informeth thee the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"    As to Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah, the Lawh-i-Sultan, despatched to him from Akka  and constituting Baha'u'llah's lengthiest Epistle to any single sovereign,  proclaims: \"O King! I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch,  when lo, the breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught  Me the knowledge of all that hath been. This thing is not from Me, but  from One Who is Almighty and All-Knowing. And He bade Me lift up My voice  between earth and heaven, and for this there befell Me what hath caused  the tears of every man of understanding to flow. The learning current  amongst men I studied not; their schools I entered not. Ask of the city  wherein I dwelt, that thou mayest be well assured that I am not of them  who speak falsely. This is but a leaf which the winds of the will of thy  Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised, have stirred. Can it be still when  the tempestuous winds are blowing? Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of all  Names and Attributes! They move it as they list. The evanescent is as  nothing before Him Who is the Ever-Abiding. His all-compelling summons  hath reached Me, and caused Me to speak His praise amidst all people. I  was indeed as one dead when His behest was uttered. The hand of the will  of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Merciful, transformed Me. Can anyone  speak forth of his own accord that for which all men, both high and low,  will protest against him? Nay, by Him Who taught the Pen the eternal  mysteries, save him whom the grace of the Almighty, the All-Powerful, hath  strengthened. The Pen of the Most High addresseth Me saying: Fear not.  Relate unto His Majesty the _Sh_ah that which befell thee. His heart,  verily, is between the fingers of thy Lord, the God of Mercy, that haply  the sun of justice and bounty may shine forth above the horizon of his  heart. Thus hath the decree been irrevocably fixed by Him Who is the  All-Wise.    \"Look upon this Youth, O King, with the eyes of justice; judge thou, then,  with truth concerning what hath befallen Him. Of a verity, God hath made  thee His shadow amongst men, and the sign of His power unto all that dwell  on earth. Judge thou between Us and them that have wronged Us without  proof and without an enlightening Book. They that surround thee love thee  for their own sakes, whereas this Youth loveth thee for thine own sake,  and hath had no desire except to draw thee nigh unto the seat of grace,  and to turn thee toward the right hand of justice. Thy Lord beareth  witness unto that which I declare.    \"O King! Wert thou to incline thine ear unto the shrill of the Pen of  Glory and the cooing of the Dove of Eternity which, on the branches of the  Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, uttereth praises to God, the  Maker of all names and Creator of earth and heaven, thou wouldst attain  unto a station from which thou wouldst behold in the world of being naught  save the effulgence of the Adored One, and wouldst regard thy sovereignty  as the most contemptible of thy possessions, abandoning it to whosoever  might desire it, and setting thy face toward the Horizon aglow with the  light of His countenance. Neither wouldst thou ever be willing to bear the  burden of dominion save for the purpose of helping thy Lord, the Exalted,  the Most High. Then would the Concourse on high bless thee. O how  excellent is this most sublime station, couldst thou ascend thereunto  through the power of a sovereignty recognized as derived from the Name of  God!...    \"O King of the age! The eyes of these refugees are turned towards and  fixed upon the mercy of the Most Merciful. No doubt is there whatever that  these tribulations will be followed by the outpourings of a supreme mercy,  and these dire adversities be succeeded by an overflowing prosperity. We  fain would hope, however, that His Majesty the _Sh_ah will himself examine  these matters, and bring hope to the hearts. That which We have submitted  to thy Majesty is indeed for thine highest good. And God, verily, is a  sufficient witness unto Me....    \"O would that thou wouldst permit Me, O _Sh_ah, to send unto thee that  which would cheer the eyes, and tranquilize the souls, and persuade every  fair-minded person that with Him is the knowledge of the Book.... But for  the repudiation of the foolish and the connivance of the divines, I would  have uttered a discourse that would have thrilled and carried away the  hearts unto a realm from the murmur of whose winds can be heard: 'No God  is there but He!'...    \"I have seen, O _Sh_ah, in the path of God what eye hath not seen nor ear  heard.... How numerous the tribulations which have rained, and will soon  rain, upon Me! I advance with My face set towards Him Who is the Almighty,  the All-Bounteous, whilst behind Me glideth the serpent. Mine eyes have  rained down tears until My bed is drenched. I sorrow not for Myself,  however. By God! Mine head yearneth for the spear out of love for its  Lord. I never passed a tree, but Mine heart addressed it saying: 'O would  that thou wert cut down in My name, and My body crucified upon thee, in  the path of My Lord!'... By God! Though weariness lay Me low, and hunger  consume Me, and the bare rock be My bed, and My fellows the beasts of the  field, I will not complain, but will endure patiently as those endued with  constancy and firmness have endured patiently, through the power of God,  the Eternal King and Creator of the nations, and will render thanks unto  God under all conditions. We pray that, out of His bounty--exalted be He--He  may release, through this imprisonment, the necks of men from chains and  fetters, and cause them to turn, with sincere faces, towards His Face, Who  is the Mighty, the Bounteous. Ready is He to answer whosover calleth upon  Him, and nigh is He unto such as commune with Him.\"    In the Qayyum-i-Asma the Bab, for His part, thus addresses Muhammad  _Sh_ah: \"O King of Islam! Aid thou, with the truth, after having aided the  Book, Him Who is Our Most Great Remembrance, for God hath, in very truth,  destined for thee, and for such as circle round thee, on the Day of  Judgment, a responsible position in His Path. I swear by God, O _Sh_ah! If  thou showest enmity unto Him Who is His Remembrance, God will, on the Day  of Resurrection, condemn thee, before the kings, unto hellfire, and thou  shalt not, in very truth, find on that Day any helper except God, the  Exalted.
