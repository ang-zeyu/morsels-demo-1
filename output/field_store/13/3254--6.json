I beseech Thee by Thy generosity, whereby  the portals of Thy bounty and grace were opened wide, whereby the Temple  of Thy Holiness was established upon the throne of eternity; and by Thy  mercy whereby Thou didst invite all created things unto the table of Thy  bounties and bestowals; and by Thy grace whereby Thou didst respond, in  Thine own Self with Thy word \"Yea!\" on behalf of all in heaven and earth,  at the hour when Thy sovereignty and Thy grandeur stood revealed, at the  dawn-time when the might of Thy dominion was made manifest. And again do I  beseech Thee, by these most beauteous names, by these most noble and  sublime attributes, and by Thy most Exalted Remembrance, and by Thy pure  and spotless Beauty, and by Thy hidden Light in the most hidden pavilion,  and by Thy Name, cloaked with the garment of affliction every morn and  eve, to protect the bearer of this blessed Tablet, and whoso reciteth it,  and whoso cometh upon it, and whoso passeth around the house wherein it  is. Heal Thou, then, by it every sick, diseased and poor one, from every  tribulation and distress, from every loathsome affliction and sorrow, and  guide Thou by it whosoever desireth to enter upon the paths of Thy  guidance, and the ways of Thy forgiveness and grace.    Thou art verily the Powerful, the All-Sufficing, the Healing, the  Protector, the Giving, the Compassionate, the All-Generous, the  All-Merciful.    --Baha'u'llah          MANKIND        \"My God, Whom I worship and adore! I bear...\"      My God, Whom I worship and adore! I bear witness unto Thy unity and Thy  oneness, and acknowledge Thy gifts, both in the past and in the present.  Thou art the All-Bountiful, the overflowing showers of Whose mercy have  rained down upon high and low alike, and the splendors of Whose grace have  been shed over both the obedient and the rebellious.    O God of mercy, before Whose door the quintessence of mercy hath bowed  down, and round the sanctuary of Whose Cause loving-kindness, in its  inmost spirit, hath circled, we beseech Thee, entreating Thine ancient  grace, and seeking Thy present favor, that Thou mayest have mercy upon all  who are the manifestations of the world of being, and deny them not the  outpourings of Thy grace in Thy days.    All are but poor and needy, and Thou, verily, art the All-Possessing, the  All-Subduing, the All-Powerful.    --Baha'u'llah        \"O Thou compassionate Lord, Thou Who art...\"      O Thou compassionate Lord, Thou Who art generous and able! We are servants  of Thine sheltered beneath Thy providence. Cast Thy glance of favor upon  us. Give light to our eyes, hearing to our ears, and understanding and  love to our hearts. Render our souls joyous and happy through Thy glad  tidings. O Lord! Point out to us the pathway of Thy kingdom and  resuscitate all of us through the breaths of the Holy Spirit. Bestow upon  us life everlasting and confer upon us never-ending honor. Unify mankind  and illumine the world of humanity. May we all follow Thy pathway, long  for Thy good pleasure and seek the mysteries of Thy kingdom. O God! Unite  us and connect our hearts with Thy indissoluble bond. Verily, Thou art the  Giver, Thou art the Kind One and Thou art the Almighty.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O Thou kind Lord! O Thou Who art generous...\"      O Thou kind Lord! O Thou Who art generous and merciful! We are servants of  Thy threshold and are gathered beneath the sheltering shadow of Thy divine  unity. The sun of Thy mercy is shining upon all, and the clouds of Thy  bounty shower upon all. Thy gifts encompass all, Thy loving providence  sustains all, Thy protection overshadows all, and the glances of Thy favor  are cast upon all. O Lord! Grant Thine infinite bestowals, and let the  light of Thy guidance shine. Illumine the eyes, gladden the hearts with  abiding joy. Confer a new spirit upon all people and bestow upon them  eternal life. Unlock the gates of true understanding and let the light of  faith shine resplendent. Gather all people beneath the shadow of Thy  bounty and cause them to unite in harmony, so that they may become as the  rays of one sun, as the waves of one ocean, and as the fruit of one tree.  May they drink from the same fountain. May they be refreshed by the same  breeze. May they receive illumination from the same source of light. Thou  art the Giver, the Merciful, the Omnipotent.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O Thou kind Lord! Thou hast created all...\"      O Thou kind Lord! Thou hast created all humanity from the same stock. Thou  hast decreed that all shall belong to the same household. In Thy Holy  Presence they are all Thy servants, and all mankind are sheltered beneath  Thy Tabernacle; all have gathered together at Thy Table of Bounty; all are  illumined through the light of Thy Providence.    O God! Thou art kind to all, Thou hast provided for all, dost shelter all,  conferrest life upon all. Thou hast endowed each and all with talents and  faculties, and all are submerged in the Ocean of Thy Mercy.    O Thou kind Lord! Unite all. Let the religions agree and make the nations  one, so that they may see each other as one family and the whole earth as  one home. May they all live together in perfect harmony.    O God! Raise aloft the banner of the oneness of mankind.    O God! Establish the Most Great Peace.    Cement Thou, O God, the hearts together.    O Thou kind Father, God! Gladden our hearts through the fragrance of Thy  love. Brighten our eyes through the Light of Thy Guidance. Delight our  ears with the melody of Thy Word, and shelter us all in the Stronghold of  Thy Providence.    Thou art the Mighty and Powerful, Thou art the Forgiving and Thou art the  One Who overlooketh the shortcomings of all mankind.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O God, O Thou Who hast cast Thy splendor...\"      O God, O Thou Who hast cast Thy splendor over the luminous realities of  men, shedding upon them the resplendent lights of knowledge and guidance,  and hast chosen them out of all created things for this supernal grace,  and hast caused them to encompass all things, to understand their inmost  essence, and to disclose their mysteries, bringing them forth out of  darkness into the visible world! \"He verily showeth His special mercy to  whomsoever He will.\"(2)    O Lord, help Thou Thy loved ones to acquire knowledge and the sciences and  arts, and to unravel the secrets that are treasured up in the inmost  reality of all created beings. Make them to hear the hidden truths that  are written and embedded in the heart of all that is. Make them to be  ensigns of guidance amongst all creatures, and piercing rays of the mind  shedding forth their light in this, the \"first life.\"(3) Make them to be  leaders unto Thee, guides unto Thy path, runners urging men on to Thy  Kingdom.    Thou verily art the Powerful, the Protector, the Potent, the Defender, the  Mighty, the Most Generous.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          MARRIAGE        \"He is the Bestower, the Bounteous!...\"      \"Baha'i marriage is union and cordial affection between the two parties.  They must, however, exercise the utmost care and become"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19243"],[0,"The Advent of Divine Justice (#11)"],[1,"education, however pressing their cares and preoccupations, however  unfavorable the environment in which they live. \"God,\" Baha'u'llah,  Himself, has unmistakably revealed, \"hath prescribed unto everyone the  duty of teaching His Cause.\" \"Say,\" He further has written, \"Teach ye the  Cause of God, O people of Baha, for God hath prescribed unto everyone the  duty of proclaiming His Message, and regardeth it as the most meritorious  of all deeds.\"    A high and exalted position in the ranks of the community, conferring as  it does on its holder certain privileges and prerogatives, no doubt  invests him with a responsibility that he cannot honorably shirk in his  duty to teach and promote the Faith of God. It may, at times, though not  invariably, create greater opportunities and furnish better facilities to  spread the knowledge of that Faith, and to win supporters to its  institutions. It does not, however, under any circumstances, necessarily  carry with it the power of exercising greater influence on the minds and  hearts of those to whom that Faith is presented. How often--and the early  history of the Faith in the land of its birth offers many a striking  testimony--have the lowliest adherents of the Faith, unschooled and utterly  inexperienced, and with no standing whatever, and in some cases devoid of  intelligence, been capable of winning victories for their Cause, before  which the most brilliant achievements of the learned, the wise, and the  experienced have paled.    \"Peter,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha has testified, \"according to the history of the  Church, was also incapable of keeping count of the days of the week.  Whenever he decided to go fishing, he would tie up his weekly food into  seven parcels, and every day he would eat one of them, and when he had  reached the seventh, he would know that the Sabbath had arrived, and  thereupon would observe it.\" If the Son of Man was capable of infusing  into apparently so crude and helpless an instrument such potency as to  cause, in the words of Baha'u'llah, \"the mysteries of wisdom and of  utterance to flow out of his mouth,\" and to exalt him above the rest of  His disciples, and render him fit to become His successor and the founder  of His Church, how much more can the Father, Who is Baha'u'llah, empower  the most puny and insignificant among His followers to achieve, for the  execution of His purpose, such wonders as would dwarf the mightiest  achievements of even the first apostle of Jesus Christ!    \"The Bab,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha, moreover, has written, \"hath said: 'Should a tiny  ant desire, in this day, to be possessed of such power as to be able to  unravel the abstrusest and most bewildering passages of the Qur'an, its  wish will no doubt be fulfilled, inasmuch as the mystery of eternal might  vibrates within the innermost being of all created things.' If so helpless  a creature can be endowed with so subtle a capacity, how much more  efficacious must be the power released through the liberal effusions of  the grace of Baha'u'llah!\"    The field is indeed so immense, the period so critical, the Cause so  great, the workers so few, the time so short, the privilege so priceless,  that no follower of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, worthy to bear His name, can  afford a moment's hesitation. That God-born Force, irresistible in its  sweeping power, incalculable in its potency, unpredictable in its course,  mysterious in its workings, and awe-inspiring in its manifestations--a  Force which, as the Bab has written, \"vibrates within the innermost being  of all created things,\" and which, according to Baha'u'llah, has through  its \"vibrating influence,\" \"upset the equilibrium of the world and  revolutionized its ordered life\"--such a Force, acting even as a two-edged  sword, is, under our very eyes, sundering, on the one hand, the age-old  ties which for centuries have held together the fabric of civilized  society, and is unloosing, on the other, the bonds that still fetter the  infant and as yet unemancipated Faith of Baha'u'llah. The undreamt-of  opportunities offered through the operation of this Force--the American  believers must now rise, and fully and courageously exploit them. \"The  holy realities of the Concourse on high,\" writes 'Abdu'l-Baha, \"yearn, in  this day, in the Most Exalted Paradise, to return unto this world, so that  they may be aided to render some service to the threshold of the Abha  Beauty, and arise to demonstrate their servitude to His sacred Threshold.\"    A world, dimmed by the steadily dying-out light of religion, heaving with  the explosive forces of a blind and triumphant nationalism; scorched with  the fires of pitiless persecution, whether racial or religious; deluded by  the false theories and doctrines that threaten to supplant the worship of  God and the sanctification of His laws; enervated by a rampant and brutal  materialism; disintegrating through the corrosive influence of moral and  spiritual decadence; and enmeshed in the coils of economic anarchy and  strife--such is the spectacle presented to men's eyes, as a result of the  sweeping changes which this revolutionizing Force, as yet in the initial  stage of its operation, is now producing in the life of the entire planet.    So sad and moving a spectacle, bewildering as it must be to every observer  unaware of the purposes, the prophecies, and promises of Baha'u'llah, far  from casting dismay into the hearts of His followers, or paralyzing their  efforts, cannot but deepen their faith, and excite their enthusiastic  eagerness to arise and display, in the vast field traced for them by the  pen of 'Abdu'l-Baha, their capacity to play their part in the work of  universal redemption proclaimed by Baha'u'llah. Every instrument in the  administrative machinery which, in the course of several years, they have  so laboriously erected must be fully utilized, and subordinated to the end  for which it was created. The Temple, that proud embodiment of so rare a  spirit of self-sacrifice, must likewise be made to play its part, and  contribute its share to the teaching campaign designed to embrace the  entire Western Hemisphere.    The opportunities which the turmoil of the present age presents, with all  the sorrows which it evokes, the fears which it excites, the  disillusionment which it produces, the perplexities which it creates, the  indignation which it arouses, the revolt which it provokes, the grievances  it engenders, the spirit of restless search which it awakens, must, in  like manner, be exploited for the purpose of spreading far and wide the  knowledge of the redemptive power of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, and for  enlisting fresh recruits in the ever-swelling army of His followers. So  precious an opportunity, so rare a conjunction of favorable circumstances,  may never again recur. Now is the time, the appointed time, for the  American believers, the vanguard of the hosts of the Most Great Name, to  proclaim, through the agencies and channels of a specially designed  Administrative Order, their capacity and readiness to rescue a fallen and  sore-tried generation that has rebelled against its God and ignored His  warnings, and to offer it that complete security which only the  strongholds of their Faith can provide.    The teaching campaign, inaugurated throughout the states of the North  American Republic and the Dominion of Canada, acquires, therefore, an  importance, and is invested with an urgency, that cannot be overestimated.  Launched on its course through the creative energies released by the Will  of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and sweeping across the Western Hemisphere through the  propelling force which it is generating, it must, I feel, be carried out  in conformity with certain principles, designed to insure its efficient  conduct, and to hasten the attainment of its objective.    Those who participate in such a campaign, whether in an organizing  capacity, or as workers to whose care the execution of the task itself has  been committed, must, as an essential preliminary to the discharge of  their duties, thoroughly familiarize themselves with the various aspects  of the history and teachings of their Faith. In their efforts to achieve  this purpose they must study for themselves, conscientiously and  painstakingly, the literature of their Faith, delve into its teachings,  assimilate its laws and principles, ponder its admonitions, tenets and  purposes, commit to memory certain of its exhortations and prayers, master  the essentials of its administration, and keep abreast of its current  affairs and latest developments. They must strive to obtain, from sources  that are authoritative and unbiased, a sound knowledge of the history and  tenets of Islam--the source and background of their Faith--and approach  reverently and with a mind purged from preconceived ideas the study of the  Qur'an which, apart from the sacred scriptures of the Babi and Baha'i  Revelations, constitutes the only Book which can be regarded as an  absolutely authenticated Repository of the Word of God. They must devote  special attention to the investigation of those institutions and  circumstances that are directly connected with the origin and birth of  their Faith, with the station claimed by its Forerunner, and with the laws  revealed by its Author.    Having acquired, in their essentials, these prerequisites of success in  the teaching field, they must, whenever they contemplate undertaking any  specific mission in the countries of Latin America, endeavor, whenever  feasible, to acquire a certain proficiency in the languages spoken by the  inhabitants of those countries, and a knowledge of their customs, habits,  and outlook. \"The teachers going to those parts,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha, referring  in one of the Tablets of the Divine Plan to the Central American  Republics, has written, \"must also be familiar with the Spanish language.\"  \"A party speaking their languages ...,\" He, in another Tablet, has  written, "]]]
