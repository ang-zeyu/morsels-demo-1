One may go farther in either direction, but at one's risk. For  poetry, Cloister Oldstyle offers a safe norm, from which any wide  departure must have a correspondingly strong artistic warrant. All these  three types are beautiful, in their letters themselves, and in the  combinations of their letters into lines, paragraphs, and pages.  Beautiful typography is the very foundation of the book beautiful.    But beautiful typography involves other elements than the cut of the  type itself. The proofreading must be trained and consistent, standing  for much more than the mere correction of errors. The presswork must be  strong and even. The justification must be individual for each line, and  not according to a fixed scale as in machine setting; even when we hold  the page upside down, we must not be able to detect any streamlets of  white slanting across the page. Moreover, if the page is leaded, the  spacing must be wider in proportion, so that the color picture of the  rectangle of type shall be even and not form a zebra of black and white  stripes. It is hardly necessary to say that the registration must be  true, so that the lines of the two pages on the same leaf shall show  accurately back to back when one holds the page to the light. Minor  elements of the page may contribute beauty or ugliness according to  their handling: the headline and page number, their character and  position; notes marginal or indented, footnotes; chapter headings and  initials; catch-words; borders, head and tail pieces, vignettes,  ornamental rules. Even the spacing of initials is a task for the skilled  craftsman. Some printers go so far as to miter or shave the type-body of  initials to make them, when printed, seem to cling more closely to the  following text. Indenting, above all in poetry, is a feature strongly  affecting the beauty of the page. Not too many words may be divided  between lines; otherwise the line endings will bristle with hyphens. A  paragraph should not end at the bottom of a page nor begin too near it,  neither should a final page contain too little nor be completely full.  Minor parts of the book, the half-title, the dedication page, the table  of contents, the preface, the index, present so many opportunities to  make or mar the whole. Especially is this true of the title-page. This  the earliest books did not have, and many a modern printer, confronted  with a piece of refractory title copy, must have sighed for the good old  days of the colophon. Whole books have been written on the title-page;  it must suffice here to say that each represents a new problem, a  triumphant solution of which gives the booklover as much pleasure to  contemplate as any other single triumph of the volume.    But what of color--splendid initials in red, blue, or green, rubricated  headings, lines, or paragraphs? It is all a question of propriety,  literary and artistic. The same principle holds as in decoration of  binding. A beautiful black and white page is so beautiful that he who  would improve it by color must be sure of his touch. The beauty of the  result and never the beauty of the means by itself must be the test.    But books are not always composed of text alone. We need not consider  diagrams, which hardly concern the book beautiful, except to say that,  being composed of lines, they are often really more decorative than  illustrations fondly supposed to be artistic. The fact that an engraving  is beautiful is no proof that it will contribute beauty to a book; it  may only make an esthetic mess of the text and itself. As types are  composed of firm black lines, only fairly strong black-line engravings  have any artistic right in the book. This dictum, however, would rule  out so many pictures enjoyed by the reader that he may well plead for a  less sweeping ban; so, as a concession to weakness, we may allow  white-line engravings and half-tones if they are printed apart from the  text and separated from it, either by being placed at the end of the  book or by having a sheet of opaque paper dividing each from the text.  In this case the legend of the picture should face it so that the reader  will have no occasion to look beyond the two pages when he has them  before him. The printers of the sixteenth century, especially the Dutch,  did not hesitate to send their pages through two presses, one the  typographic press, and the other the roller press for copper-plate  engravings. The results give us perhaps the best example that we have of  things beautiful in themselves but unlovely in combination. As in the  use of other ornamental features, there are no bounds to the use of  illustration except that of fitness.    We have spoken of margins from the point of view of the page; from that  of the closed book they appear as edges, and here they present several  problems in the design of the book beautiful. If the book is designed  correctly from the beginning, the margins will be of just the right  width and the edges cannot be trimmed without making them too narrow.  Besides, the untrimmed edges are witnesses to the integrity of the book;  if any exception may be made, it will be in the case of the top margin,  which may be gilded both for beauty and to make easy the removal of  dust. But the top should be rather shaved than trimmed, so that the  margin may not be visibly reduced. The gilding of all the edges, or  \"full gilt,\" is hardly appropriate to the book beautiful, though it may  be allowed in devotional books, especially those in limp binding, and  its effect may there be heightened by laying the gilt on red or some  other color. Edges may be goffered, that is, decorated with incised or  burnt lines, though the result, like tattooing, is more curious than  ornamental. The edges may even be made to receive pictures, but here  again the effect smacks of the barbaric.    We have now gone over our subject in the large. To pursue it with all  possible degrees of minuteness would require volumes. William Morris,  for instance, discusses the proper shape for the dot of the i; and even  the size of the dot and its place above the letter are matters on which  men hold warring opinions. We have not even raised the question of laid  or wove paper, nor of the intermixture of different series or sizes of  types. In short, every phase of the subject bristles with moot points,  the settlement of one of which in a given way may determine the  settlement of a score of others.    But what is the use to the public of this knowledge and enjoyment of  ours? Is it not after all a fruitless piece of self-indulgence? Surely,  if bookmaking is one of the minor arts, then the private knowledge and  enjoyment of its products is an element in the culture of the community.  But it is more than that; it is both a pledge and a stimulus to  excellence in future production. Artists in all fields are popularly  stigmatized as a testy lot--_irritabile genus_--but their techiness does  not necessarily mean opposition to criticism, but only to uninformed and  unappreciative criticism, especially if it be cocksure and blatant.  There is nothing that the true artist craves so much--not even  praise--as understanding of his work and the welcome that awaits his  work in hand from the lips of \"those who know.\" Thus those who  appreciate and welcome the book beautiful, by their encouragement help  to make it more beautiful, and so by head and heart, if not by hand,  they share in the artist's creative effort. Also, by thus promoting  beauty in books, they discourage ugliness in books, narrowing the public  that will accept ugly books and lessening the degree of ugliness that  even this public will endure. Finally, it seems no mere fancy to hold  that by creating the book beautiful as the setting of the noblest  literature, we are rendering that literature itself a service in the  eyes of others through the costly tribute that we pay to the worth of  the jewel itself.          THE READER'S HIGH PRIVILEGE      In De Morgan's winsome story, \"Alice for Short,\" the heroine of the  earlier portion, Miss Peggy Heath, is made to feel what it would mean to  her to be deprived of a certain companion, and thus realizes his  importance to her life.    It is this test of elimination that I shall ask you to apply to reading.  Imagine yourselves deprived of the privilege, as many another has been  by loss of sight or illness or poverty or removal from book centers. I  have in mind such an instance. The late Professor William Mathews was  injured by a fall when he was ninety years old, and until the end of his  life, about a year later, was confined to his bed. You may know him as  the author of various books of essays: \"Getting on in the World,\" \"Great  Conversers,\" \"Hours with Men and Books,\" \"Words, their Use and Abuse,\"  and other volumes that testify a marvelous range of acquaintance with  literature. He wrote to a friend that he was brightening his hours of  loneliness by repeating to himself passages of poetry and prose that he  had learned by heart in his earlier days. Few of us can ever have such  stores of memory to draw upon as his, but how happy we should be if  under such circumstances we might be able to turn to a like source of  consolation. Yet we have a much more famous instance of a great scholar  cut off from the privilege of reading. Milton has given us in his famous  invocation to Light, with which he opens the third book of \"Paradise  Lost,\" a picture of his own deprivation, presented with a universal  blank in place of Nature's fair book of knowledge. The passage is too  long to quote here, but let the reader turn to it, if only to refresh  his memory.    This shows the privilege that we are now enjoying, and it may perhaps be  sufficient to take our lesson at this point; but since it is always  pleasanter to consider gain rather than loss, suppose we turn the  subject around and imagine how it would seem if, after having "]]]
