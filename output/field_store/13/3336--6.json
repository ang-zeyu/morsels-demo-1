[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],[0,"The Faith of Islam (#11)"],[1," _Khass_, or special words. These are sub-divided into three classes.  First, words which relate to genus, _e.g._ mankind. Secondly, words which  relate to species, _e.g._ a man, which refers to men as distinguished from  women. Thirdly, words which relate to special individuality, _e.g._ Zeid,  which is the name of a special individual.    2. _'Amm_, or common or collective names, such as \"people.\"    3. _Mushtarik_, or words which have several significations, as the Arabic  word \"'ain,\" which may mean an eye, a fountain, or the sun. Again, the word  \"Sulat,\" if connected with God, may mean mercy, as \"Sulat Ullah,\" the mercy  of God; if with man, it may mean either \"namaz,\" a stated liturgical  service, or \"du'a,\" prayer in its ordinary sense, _e.g._ Sulat-ul-Istisqa  (prayer in time of drought) is du'a, not namaz.    4. _Muawwal_, words which have several significations, all of which are  possible, and so a special explanation is required. For example, Sura  cviii. 2, reads thus in Sale's translation. \"Wherefore pray unto the Lord  and _slay_ (the victims).\" The word translated \"slay\" is in Arabic \"nahr,\"  which has many meanings. The followers of the great Legist Abu Hanifa  render it, \"sacrifice,\" and add the words (the \"victims\"). The followers of  Ibn Shafa'i say it means \"placing the hands on the breast in prayer.\"    This illustrates the difference between Mushtarik and Muawwal. In the  former, only one meaning is allowable, and that meaning the context  settles; in the latter both meanings are allowable and both right.    These divisions of words having been well mastered and the power of  defining any word in the Quran gained, the {49} student passes on to  consider the nature of the sentences. These are divided into two great  classes,--the \"Obvious,\" and the \"Hidden.\"    This division is referred to in the following passage of the Quran. \"He it  is who hath sent down to thee the book. Some of its signs are of themselves  _perspicuous_; these are the basis (literally \"mother\") of the book, and  others are _figurative_. But they whose hearts are given to err follow its  figures, craving discord, craving an interpretation; yet none know its  interpretation, but God.[51] And the stable in knowledge say: 'We believe  in it, it is all from God.'\" (Sura iii. 3).    This has given rise to the division of the whole book into literal and  allegorical statements. In order to explain these correctly the commentator  must know (1) the reason why, (2) the place where, (3) the time when, the  particular passage he is expounding was revealed; he must know whether it  abrogates or is abrogated, whether it is in its proper order and place or  not; whether it contains its meaning within itself or needs the light which  the context throws upon it; he must know all the Traditions which bear upon  it, and the authority for each such Tradition. This effectually confines  the order of commentators in the strict sense of the word to the  Companions, and supplies the reason why commentators since then simply  reproduce their opinions.[52] But to return from this digression. Sentences  are Zahir--\"Obvious,\" or Khafi--\"Hidden.\" Obvious sentences are divided  into four classes.    I. (1). _Zahir_, or obvious, the meaning of which is so clear that he who  hears it at once understands its meaning {50} without seeking for any  explanation. This kind of sentence may be abrogated. Unless abrogated,  action in accordance with it is to be considered as the express command of  God. All penal laws and the rules regulating the substitution of one  religious act for another, _e.g._ almsgiving instead of fasting, must be  based on this, the clearest of the obvious sentences.    (2). _Nass_, a word commonly used for a text of the Quran, but in its  technical meaning here expressing what is meant by a sentence, the meaning  of which is made clear by some word which occurs in it. The following  sentence illustrates both Zahir and Nass: \"Take in marriage of such other  women as please you, two, three, four.\" This sentence is Zahir, because  marriage is here declared lawful; it is Nass, because the words \"one, two,  three, four,\" which occur in the sentence, show the unlawfulness of having  more than four wives.    (3). _Mufassir_, or explained. This is a sentence which needs some word in  it to explain it and make it clear. Thus: \"And the angels prostrated  themselves, all of them with one accord, save Iblis (Satan).\" Here the  words \"save Iblis,\" show that he did not prostrate himself. This kind of  sentence may be abrogated.    (4). _Mukham_, or perspicuous. This is a sentence as to the meaning of  which there can be no doubt, and which cannot be controverted, thus: \"God  knoweth all things.\" This kind of sentence cannot be abrogated. To act on  such sentences without departing from the literal sense is the highest  degree of obedience to God's command.    The difference between these sentences is seen when there is a real or  apparent contradiction between them. If such should occur, the first must  give place to the second, and so on. Thus Mukham cannot be abrogated or  changed by any of the preceding, or Mufassir by Nass, &c.    The other great division of sentences is that of    II. (1). _Khafi_ or hidden. Such are those sentences in {51} which other  persons or things are hidden beneath the plain meaning of a word or  expression contained therein, as: \"as for a thief, whether male or female,  cut ye off their hands in recompense for their doings.\" (Sura v. 42). The  word for thief is \"Sariq,\" and in this passage it is understood to include  highwaymen, pickpockets, plunderers of the dead, &c. These meanings are  Khafi or hidden under it.    (2). _Muskhil_, or ambiguous, The following is given as an illustration:  \"And (their attendants) shall go round about them with vessels of silver  and goblets. The bottles shall be bottles of silver.\" The difficulty here  is that bottles are not made of silver, but of glass. The commentators say,  however, that glass is dull in colour, though it has some lustre, whilst  silver is white, and not so bright as glass. Now it may be, that the  bottles of Paradise will be like glass bottles as regards their lustre, and  like silver as regards their colour. But anyhow, it is very difficult to  ascertain the meaning.    (3.) _Mujmal._ These are, first, sentences which may have a variety of  interpretations, owing to the words in them being capable of several  meanings; in that case the meaning which is given to the sentence in the  Traditions relating to it should be acted on and accepted. Secondly, the  sentence may contain some very rare word, and thus its meaning may be  doubtful, as: \"Man truly is by creation hasty.\" (Sura lxx. 19.) In this  verse the word \"halu'\"--hasty--occurs. It is very rarely used, and had it  not been for the following words, \"when evil toucheth him, he is full of  complaint; but when good befalleth him, he becometh niggardly,\" its meaning  would not have been at all easy to understand.    The following is an illustration of the first kind of _Mujmal_ sentences:  \"Stand for prayer (salat) and give alms,\" (zakat.) Both salat and zakat are  'Mushtarik' words. The people, therefore, did not understand this verse, so  they applied to Muhammad for an explanation. He explained to them that  \"salat\" might mean the ritual of public prayer, {52} standing to say the  words \"God is great,\" or standing to repeat a few verses of the Quran; or  it might mean private prayer. The primitive meaning of \"zakat\" is growing.  The Prophet, however, fixed the meaning here to that of \"almsgiving,\" and  said, \"Give of your substance one-fortieth part.\"    (4.) _Mutashabih._ These are sentences so difficult that men cannot  understand them, a fact referred to in Sura iii. 3. (Ante. p. 49), nor will  they do so until the day of resurrection. The Prophet, however, knew their  meaning. Such portions are the letters A, L, M; A, L, R; Y, A at the  commencement of some of the Suras.[53] Such expressions also as \"God's  hand,\" \"The face of God,\" \"God sitteth,\" &c., come under this category.    The next point to be considered is the _use_ of words in the Quran, and  here again the same symmetrical division into four classes is found,  _viz_:--    (1.) _Haqiqat_, that is, words which are used in their literal meaning, as  \"ruku',\" a prostration, and \"salat\" in the sense of prayer.    (2.) _Majaz_, or words which are used in a figurative sense, as \"salat\" in  the sense of \"namaz\" a liturgical service.    (3.) _Sarih_, or words the meaning of which is quite evident, as, \"Thou art  _divorced_,\" \"Thou art _free_.\"    (4.) _Kinayah_, or words which, being used in a metaphorical sense, require  the aid of the context to make their meaning clear, as: \"Thou art  separated,\" which may, as it {53} stands alone, mean \"Thou art divorced.\"  This class also includes all pronouns the meaning of which is only to be  known from the context, _e.g._ one day the Prophet not knowing who knocked  at his door said, \"Who art thou?\" The man replied, \"It is I.\" Muhammad  answered, \"Why dost thou say I, I? Say thy name that I may know who thou  art.\" The pronoun \"I\" is here 'kinayah.'    The most important and most difficult branch of exegesis is \"istidlal,\" or  the science of deducing arguments from the Quran. This too is divided into  four sections, as follows:--    (1.) _Ibarat_, or the plain sentence. \"Mothers, after they are divorced,  shall give suck unto their children two full years, and the father shall be  obliged to maintain them and clothe them according to that which is  reasonable.\" (Sura ii. 233.) From this verse two deductions are made.  First, from the fact that the word \"them\" is in the feminine plural, it  must refer to the mothers and not to the children; secondly, as the duty of  supporting the mother is incumbent on the father, it shows that the  relationship of the child is closer with the father than with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20663"],[0,"The American Practical Brewer and Tanner (#11)"],[1,"of chance, to copy the  original as close as we can.    I know I shall be justly accused with tautology. I must plead guilty to  the charge, not having leisure to apply the pruning hook of correction.  The misfortune is, that new doctrines must appear in a new dress, by  which they wear the garb of novelty, though, with respect to first  principles, there is nothing new under the sun; yet the application of  these principles might have remained in oblivion for ever if not called  into action. The man who in an age calls them into action, and  beneficially applies them for the good of that community of which he is  a member, may be virtually, though not literally, called the discoverer  of a principle. The man that projects, and the man that executes a  voyage of discovery, have superior claims to the man at the mast head  who first cries out land. The new turn that the discoveries of modern  philosophers has given to natural philosophy, requiring a change of  names as well as system; unusual words are unavoidably introduced to  express new terms of science, which gives a different character and  fashion to the whole, that I should have great pleasure in avoiding,  were it possible, which it obviously is not, finding it easier to glide  down the stream than oppose its torrent.    Notwithstanding that I have calculated upon nineteen pounds only of  twenty-five pounds per barrel of fermentable matter being attenuated,  and have even in that quantity included five pounds eight ounces of  lees and yest, (the least quantity produced,) such calculation must not  be admitted to preclude the practicability of attenuating almost every  particle of fermentable matter, and replacing it with an equivalent  particle of spirit, if that spirit which is now carried off by the  avolation of the fixed air, is, agreeably to my proposal, either  arrested in its flight, or filtered, after its escape from the guile  tun and cleansing vat, by the proper apparatus.    Having in a former part of these papers observed, that attenuation may  be carried too far, it may be necessary for me to reconcile these  seemingly opposite positions, which should be understood in this way:  When the quantity of fermentable matter, suspended in a barrel of  worts, intended for beer, or ale, is from five to ten pounds more than  twenty-five pounds per barrel, every particle of it may be safely  attenuated, as the quantity of spirit generated will be sufficient to  preserve the beer, or ale, for any requisite length of time, provided  it has been properly hopped, &c., or in lieu thereof, received certain  other additions to improve its vinosity, strength, and keeping; when  the quantity of fermentable matter in worts is from five to fifteen  pounds per barrel less than twenty-five pounds, the height of the  attenuation ought to be limited on keeping beer and ale; the spirit  generated being insufficient to preserve so much fermented fluid in a  drinkable state for any length of time, with the usual additions only,  even during the summer heats of our own climate; and if so, it is  totally unfit for either exportation to warm latitudes, or for keeping  at home.    For the right understanding of these observations, we should consider  that the unattenuated fermentable matter is perpetually furnishing a  gradual supply of fixed air and spirit, by means of the imperceptible  fermentation always going on in vinous liquors.    Weak beers and ales fret and spoil very soon in warm weather, which  proceeds from the development and avolation of their fixed air; strong  beers and ales have their limits under the same influence of heat,  time, change of the atmosphere, &c., and owe their preservation to two  things, viz. to a due proportion of fermentable matter unattenuated, or  the quantity of spirit they contain; as under these circumstances they  are either preserved by the spirit already formed, or that continually  supplied by the spontaneous decomposition of the fermentable matter  they contain, slowly developing and yielding a fresh supply of air and  spirit; hence beer and ales, not too highly attenuated, derive strength  and spirituosity from age, when properly stored or cellared, and duly  secured from the changes of the atmosphere.    These observations are applicable to sweets, or made wines, and to  those which are the produce of the grape, the progress of fermentation  and attenuation being (or ought to be) interrupted in them by racking  off, which is similar to cleansing in beers and ales: and in Madeiras,  and other dry wines, the incipient acidity is corrected and restrained,  by proper additions introduced in the early part of the process, and  with others of similar effect when the wines are making up, either for  use or exportation.    We may gather from these observations, that worts attenuated for beer  or ale, to the decomposition of all their fermentable matter, that is,  attenuated so high, or so low, that their specific gravity is reduced  to the standard of common water, and from that to the degree of levity  spirit is known to give to water, in the proportion to the quantity  added, and left to the preservation of the spirit formed, they have  little or no auxiliary assistance from their original products, already  exhausted by the highest or completest attenuation obtainable; an  important circumstance, always to be attended to, particularly by those  who affect an unnecessarily high attenuation!    The intelligent brewer may, by the assistance of these observations,  form a most accurate rule for the regulation of his future conduct in  the management of fermentation, according as his beer or ale is to  be weak or strong, or for present use or long keeping; for the  accomplishment of which, the use of the hydrometer and thermometer  claim his peculiar attention, and will undoubtedly answer his  expectations, when joined to the certainty he is now at, of knowing  when he is, or is not, to expect the development of fixed air and  additional spirit, by which he can govern himself accordingly.    These observations lead to a removal of the difficulties that lay in  the way, and, at the same time, suggest a mode of applying the present,  or of constructing a future _hydrometer_, for ascertaining the strength  or the quantity of the vinous spirit in beer, wine, ale, and other  fermented fluids, which has long been a desirable object.    The distiller, having none of these niceties to attend to, is governed  by the ultimate extent of the attenuation the worts, or wash, is found  capable of, and which is both assisted and protracted by its superior  density, in its progress from specific gravity to specific levity, if  such an expression is admissible.    Fermentation, begun in a fluid more or less saturated with saccharine  or fermentable matter, the process is finished sooner or later, and  usually in proportion to the degree of saturation, and the being  conducted with more or less vigour under a well regulated temperature;  for the more a fluid abounds with this matter, the grosser and denser  it must necessarily be, and the longer will the attenuation be  protracted; the longer it is protracted, in air-tight vessels, and in a  healthy and vigourous state of decomposition, the more spiritous and  strong will that wash turn out, and the greater the produce of spirit  in distillation; hence, it is both protracted and assisted by its  density.    A languid may be truly called an unhealthy decomposition, it being  productive of diseases common to misconducted fermentation, acidity,  putridity, and lack of spirits, with a tendency to precipitate and burn  upon the bottom of the still; hence, all the decompositions are  confounded together, as in spontaneous fermentation.    The formation of acidity during the process, is not of that injury to  the distiller that it is to the brewer, nor is this recent acidity  vinegar, as has been supposed by some chemists, but the incipient state  of combination of resolving elements, whose particles are in that  juxtaposition best suited to absorb developing hydrogen in a nascent  state, and intimately to combine with it into vinous spirit, the  approximation to which is promoted by time and incumbent pressure:  these positions shall be explained as I proceed.    The reason that putridity is so rarely discovered in excited  fermentation, is, that it is usually counteracted by the previously  evolved acidity, and corrected, but not saturated or neutralized; for,  were that the case, the putrid could not immediately succeed the  acetous process in the same fluid, nor exist together, as they are  known to do in declining beer, vinegar, &c.    The reason that acidity is not more frequently observed and attended to  than it is, is because of its being sheathed or covered by the  unattenuated sweets, or fermentable matter of the wash that remains  undecomposed.    On the other hand, when acidity is very prevalent, it may be mistaken  for unattenuated fermentable matter, acidity increasing the density and  specific gravity of the fluid.    Putridity, from the avolation of its products, promotes levity, and  that in proportion as its increase surpasses that of the general acid;  and it is not until the action of the acetous becomes languid, that the  putrid process gains the ascendency, when it is then difficult to  overcome.    Although these observations may show how the hydrometer, or its use, in  unexperienced hands may be baffled, they both distinguish and explain  the value of its application; they do more--they elucidate the doctrine  of fermentation, and illustrate the goodness of Providence, who has  made nothing in vain, but provided nature with its own resources for  conducting every operation in the great plan of the universe with  uniform and unerring security.    In the decomposition of fermentable matter, either by combustion or  fermentation, (which I have defined to be synonimous,) a portion"]]]
