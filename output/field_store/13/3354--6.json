He was a tourist, and tourists buy  these foolish souvenirs.\"    Tarling nodded again.    \"That is possible,\" he said. \"I have already thought that such might have  been the case. Yet, why should he have this sign of the 'Cheerful Hearts'  in his pocket on the night he was murdered?\"    \"Master,\" said the Chinaman, \"why should he have been murdered?\"    Tarling's lips curled in a half smile.    \"By which I suppose you mean that one question is as difficult to answer  as the other,\" he said. \"All right, Ling Chu, that will do.\"    His principal anxiety for the moment was not this, or any other clue  which had been offered, but the discovery of Odette Rider's present  hiding-place. Again and again he turned the problem over in his mind. At  every point he was baffled by the wild improbability of the facts that he  had discovered. Why should Odette Rider be content to accept a servile  position in Lyne's Stores when her mother was living in luxury at  Hertford? Who was her father--that mysterious father who appeared and  disappeared at Hertford, and what part did he play in the crime? And if  she was innocent, why had she disappeared so completely and in  circumstances so suspicious? And what did Sam Stay know? The man's hatred  of the girl was uncanny. At the mention of her name a veritable fountain  of venom had bubbled up, and Tarling had sensed the abysmal depths of  this man's hate and something of his boundless love for the dead man.    He turned impatiently on the couch and reached out his hand for his tea,  when there came a soft tap at the door and Ling Chu slipped into the  room.    \"The Bright Man is here,\" he said, and in these words announced  Whiteside, who brought into the room something of his alert, fresh  personality which had earned him the pseudonym which Ling Chu had  affixed.    \"Well, Mr. Tarling,\" said the Inspector, taking out a little notebook,  \"I'm afraid I haven't done very much in the way of discovering the  movements of Miss Rider, but so far as I can find out by inquiries made  at Charing Cross booking office, several young ladies unattended have  left for the Continent in the past few days.\"    \"You cannot identify any of these with Miss Rider?\" asked Tarling in a  tone of disappointment.    The detective shook his head. Despite his apparent unsuccess, he had  evidently made some discovery which pleased him, for there was nothing  gloomy in his admission of failure.    \"You have found out something, though?\" suggested Tarling quickly, and  Whiteside nodded.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"by the greatest of luck I've got hold of a very curious  story. I was chatting with some of the ticket collectors and trying to  discover a man who might have seen the girl--I have a photograph of her  taken in a group of Stores employees, and this I have had enlarged, as it  may be very useful.\"    Tarling nodded.    \"Whilst I was talking with the man on the gate,\" Whiteside proceeded,  \"a travelling ticket inspector came up and he brought rather an  extraordinary story from Ashford. On the night of the murder there was  an accident to the Continental Express.\"    \"I remember seeing something about it,\" said Tarling, \"but my mind has  been occupied by this other matter. What happened?\"    \"A luggage truck which was standing on the platform fell between two of  the carriages and derailed one of them,\" explained Whiteside. \"The only  passenger who was hurt was a Miss Stevens. Apparently it was a case of  simple concussion, and when the train was brought to a standstill she was  removed to the Cottage Hospital, where she is to-day. Apparently the  daughter of the travelling ticket inspector is a nurse at the hospital,  and she told her father that this Miss Stevens, before she recovered  consciousness, made several references to a 'Mr. Lyne' and a 'Mr.  Milburgh'!\"    Tarling was sitting erect now, watching the other through narrowed lids.    \"Go on,\" he said quietly.    \"I could get very little from the travelling inspector, except that his  daughter was under the impression that the lady had a grudge against Mr.  Lyne, and that she spoke even more disparagingly of Mr. Milburgh.\"    Tarling had risen and slipped off his silk dressing-gown before the other  could put away his notebook. He struck a gong with his knuckles, and when  Ling Chu appeared, gave him an order in Chinese, which Whiteside could  not follow.    \"You're going to Ashford? I thought you would,\" said Whiteside. \"Would  you like me to come along?\"    \"No, thank you,\" said the other. \"I'll go myself. I have an idea that  Miss Stevens may be the missing witness in the case and may throw greater  light upon the happenings of the night before last than any other witness  we have yet interviewed.\"    He found he had to wait an hour before he could get a train for Ashford,  and he passed that hour impatiently walking up and down the broad  platform. Here was a new complication in the case. Who was Miss Stevens,  and why should she be journeying to Dover on the night of the murder?    He reached Ashford, and with difficulty found a cab, for it was raining  heavily, and he had come provided with neither mackintosh nor umbrella.    The matron of the Cottage Hospital reassured him on one point.    \"Oh, yes, Miss Stevens is still in the hospital,\" she said, and he  breathed a sigh of relief. There was just a chance that she might have  been discharged, and again the possibility that she would be difficult  to trace.    The matron showed him the way through a long corridor, terminating in a  big ward. Before reaching the door of the ward there was a smaller door  on the right.    \"We put her in this private ward, because we thought it might be  necessary to operate,\" said the matron and opened the door.    Tarling walked in. Facing him was the foot of the bed, and in that bed  lay a girl whose eyes met his. He stopped dead as though he were shot  For \"Miss Stevens\" was Odette Rider!          CHAPTER XI    \"THORNTON LYNE IS DEAD.\"      For a time neither spoke. Tarling walked slowly forward, pulled a chair  to the side of the bed and sat down, never once taking his eyes off the  girl.    Odette Rider! The woman for whom the police of England were searching,  against whom a warrant had been issued on a charge of wilful murder--and  here, in a little country hospital. For a moment, and a moment only,  Tarling was in doubt. Had he been standing outside the case and watching  it as a disinterested spectator, or had this girl never come so closely  into his life, bringing a new and a disturbing influence so that the very  balance of his judgment was upset, he would have said that she was in  hiding and had chosen this hospital for a safe retreat. The very name  under which she was passing was fictitious--a suspicious circumstance in  itself.    The girl's eyes did not leave his. He read in their clear depths a hint  of terror and his heart fell. He had not realised before that the chief  incentive he found in this case was not to discover the murderer of  Thornton Lyne, but to prove that the girl was innocent.    \"Mr. Tarling,\" she said with a queer little break in her voice, \"I--I did  not expect to see you.\"    It was a lame opening, and it seemed all the more feeble to her since she  had so carefully rehearsed the statement she had intended making. For her  waking moments, since the accident, had been filled with thoughts of this  hard-faced man, what he would think, what he would say, and what, in  certain eventualities, he would do.    \"I suppose not,\" said Tarling gently. \"I am sorry to hear you have had  rather a shaking, Miss Rider.\"    She nodded, and a faint smile played about the corners of her mouth.    \"It was nothing very much,\" she said. \"Of course, it was very harried at  first and--what do you want?\"    The last words were blurted out. She could not keep up the farce of a  polite conversation.    There was a moment's silence, and then Tarling spoke.    \"I wanted to find you,\" he said, speaking slowly, and again he read her  fear.    \"Well,\" she hesitated, and then said desperately and just a little  defiantly, \"you have found me!\"    Tarling nodded.    \"And now that you have found me,\" she went on, speaking rapidly, \"what do  you want?\"    She was resting on her elbow, her strained face turned towards him, her  eyes slightly narrowed, watching him with an intensity of gaze which  betrayed her agitation.    \"I want to ask you a few questions,\" said Tarling, and slipped a little  notebook from his pocket, balancing it upon his knee.    To his dismay the girl shook her head.    \"I don't know that I am prepared to answer your questions,\" she said more  calmly, \"but there is no reason why you should not ask them.\"    Here was an attitude wholly unexpected. And Odette Rider panic-stricken  he could understand. If she had burst into a fit of weeping, if she  had grown incoherent in her terror, if she had been indignant or  shame-faced--any of these displays would have fitted in with his  conception of her innocence or apprehension of her guilt.    \"In the first place,\" he asked bluntly, \"why are you here under the name  of Miss Stevens?\"    She thought a moment, then shook her head.    \"That is a question I am not prepared to answer,\" she "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20915"],[0,"Field's Chromatography (#11)"],[1,"een_, as well as, subordinately, the tertiaries _russet_ and _olive_.  It also enters in a very subdued degree into cool, semi-neutral, and  broken colours, and assists in minor proportion with blue and red in the  composition of _black_.    As a pigment, yellow is a tender delicate colour, easily defiled, when  pure, by other colours. In painting it diminishes the power of the eye  by its action in a strong light, at the same time becoming less distinct  as a colour; while, on the contrary, it assists vision and becomes more  distinct as a colour in a neutral somewhat declining light. These powers  of colours upon vision require the particular attention of the  colourist. To remedy the ill effect arising from the eyes having dwelt  upon a colour, they should be either passed gradually to its opposite  colour, and refreshed amid compound or neutral tints, or washed in the  clear light of day. Hence, in viewing large collections of pictures,  their colours will be more duly estimated by sometimes walking to the  window, or by taking an occasional glance at a millboard, which may be  carried in the hand, painted a cool gray.    In a warm light, yellow becomes totally lost, but is less diminished  than all other colours, except white, by distance. The stronger tones of  any colour subdue its fainter hues in the same proportion as opposite  colours and contrasts exalt them. The contrasting colours of yellow are  a purple inclining to blue when the yellow leans to orange, and a purple  inclining to red when the yellow tends to green, in the mean  proportions of _thirteen_ purple to _three_ yellow, measured in surface  or intensity. Being nearest to the neutral white in the natural scale of  colours, yellow accords with it in conjunction; while, of all colours,  except white, it contrasts black most powerfully. Yellow is discordant  when standing alone with orange, unsupported by other colours.    On account of the paucity of fine yellows among the ancients, we find  that in many paintings and beautiful illuminated MSS. of old, glowing  with vermilion and ultramarine, the place of yellow was supplied by  gilding. Now, certainly, no such scarcity exists; of the three primary  colours, good yellows being the most numerous. It may be observed of  yellow pigments that their colour being primary and therefore simple,  they cannot be composed by any mixture of other colours. The same remark  of course applies to pigments which are red or blue.    20. AUREOLIN.    In these days a new pigment soon finds its level, standing or falling  according to its merits. There are too many colours already on the  palette for a fresh comer to have much chance, unless it possess some  great distinguishing quality, or can take a place which has never been  occupied. Such a void aureolin fills. This \"magnificent yellow  pigment,\" says the _Chemical News_, \"supplies a desideratum hitherto in  vain sought for by artists. It is the nearest approach to a perfect  yellow in existence, and more closely resembles the purity of the  prismatic spectrum than any other artificial colour. It is transparent,  has great brilliancy and richness, both pure and in combination, and is  very permanent, being entirely unaffected by exposure to sulphuretted  hydrogen and other atmospheric impurities, or to the direct rays of the  sun during an entire summer. Aureolin, with ultramarine and madder red,  completes the triad of brilliant, permanent, and transparent primitive  colours.\" The above only tallies with the statements of several  scientific chemists and artists of note, statements which a prolonged  personal experience of the colour enables us to endorse. To our  knowledge, aureolin is quite uninjured by the severest tests to which a  pigment can be subjected. We have found it bear with impunity, even in  its lightest and faintest tints, the foulest gas and the brightest  sunshine. Damp has no effect upon it; and in oil, water, or fresco, it  is equally eligible. With all other colours aureolin mixes safely and  readily, forming combinations of the utmost variety and value. It  affords beautiful transparent tints, well defined, and of exceeding  purity; the paler washes being at once clear and delicate, and admitting  the most subtle gradations of tone. The artistic properties of  aureolin, however, will be best described by quoting the following  extract from Mr. Aaron Penley's _English School of Painting in Water  Colours_:--        \"I have fully tested the qualifications of _Aureolin_ for the      Landscape Painter, and, without hesitation, pronounce it to be      the most valuable addition to the 'colour box' since the      introduction of Rose Madder. It has supplied a deficiency of a      very important character. Hitherto, no Primitive Yellow has been      quite satisfactory as to its persistence; so that the Aureolin      will not only be regarded by the _artist_ as a great boon in the      production of his works, but it must also be considered as a      _real_ and _lasting benefit_ to pictorial art in general. The      permanence and unaltered purity of its lightest and faintest      tints we are assured may be confidently relied upon, inasmuch as      they have been fully established by the most severe tests to      which colour can be subjected, by several of our ablest and most      talented chemists. It is, therefore, needless to enlarge upon      its merits, other than that I, for one, feel grateful for its      introduction. Its uses are manifold, and may be considered      available for every purpose requiring a Yellow of its character.      As to Gray--perhaps it is not possible to obtain more delicately      pure and transparent aërial tints than are to be produced from      a combination of Cobalt, Rose Madder and Aureolin; all of which      are of a light description and well suited for the      representation of soft and thin effects of the atmosphere. These      colours are each of them beautiful, and yield a most exquisite      range of tones, which, as they mix together most kindly, render      them desirable where purity and delicacy are sought. As to      Foliage.--In speaking of Aureolin as adapted for the colouring      of foliage and herbage, it is impossible to say too much in its      praise. It imparts the vividness and freshness of nature to      every colour with which it is combined--a quality of the highest      order. As a colour for drapery it has no equal, and may be      employed with perfect success, either by itself or with any of      the other pigments.        \"The following table of compound tints will be found extremely      useful:--        Aureolin.     | Aureolin.         | Aureolin.    | Aureolin.      Burnt Sienna. | Vandyke Brown.    | Sepia.       | Sepia, or Rose      Indigo, or    | Indigo, or French |              |   Madder.        French Blue.|   Blue.           |              | Cobalt.        Aureolin.     | Aureolin.         | Aureolin.    | Aureolin.      Indigo.       | Oxide of Chromium.| Emerald      | Light Red.                    |                   |   Green.     | Cobalt, or                    |                   |              |   Indigo.        Aureolin.     | Aureolin.         | Aureolin.    | Aureolin.      Burnt Sienna. | Burnt Umber.      | Brown Madder.| Rose Madder.        \"Aureolin, in combination with Cobalt and Sepia, or Rose Madder,      gives most agreeable and delicate tints for distant trees, when      under the influence of a soft light, or hazy state of the      atmosphere. Having most impartially and diligently tested the      qualities of the Aureolin, I can and do most conscientiously      recommend its adoption by all who practise water-colour      painting.\"    The foregoing sufficiently proves the value of aureolin in water, and  similar flattering notices have been given of the colour in oil. Both in  a chemical and artistic sense, therefore, this new primitive yellow  merits the highest regard, and justly claims a foremost place among that  little band of pigments which are without fear and without reproach.    For mural decoration, aureolin is admirably adapted, but it cannot be  used in enamel, the colour being destroyed by great heat.      CADMIUM YELLOWS.    Of these there are three tints, _Deep_, a so-called _Pale_, and _Lemon_.    21. DEEP CADMIUM.    Cadmium Yellow is comparatively a recent introduction, the metal itself  not having been discovered till 1818. The cadmium yellows of commerce  are (the chromate excepted) all sulphides, and therefore not affected by  impure air. Until lately, they were not manufactured in England but  imported from abroad, and as a rule were sadly doctored. We have found  in them a large proportion of orpiment, chromate of lead, &c., together  with quantities of soluble salt, extracted by boiling water. Owing to  careless preparation, there was also present an unnecessary amount of  dirt, which interfered as much with the purity of the colour, as  sophistication lessened its stability. For these reasons, doubtless,  cadmium yellows got to be regarded by some with disfavour and suspicion;  and it may fairly be said that they did not attain their present  popularity, until they became an article of home produce.    Deep cadmium yellow, if genuine, may without hesitation be declared  permanent, both with respect to foul gas, and exposure to light or air.  The variety under notice is of extreme depth, inclining to orange,  glowing, lustrous, and brilliant. It is not very transparent, but  wonderfully clear and bright, of great power, and the most richly toned  yellow known. For draperies it is particularly adapted, and for gorgeous  sunsets is invaluable. It works and washes well, readily throws all  other yellows into the shade when used alone, and combines admirably  with Chinese white for the light touches of bright clouds or mountains.    By admixture with white, cadmium gives a series of beautiful clear  tints. When"]]]
