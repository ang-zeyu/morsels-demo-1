Dick instantly  followed their example and was soon at their heels.    \"Ye needn't look at the waller,\" whispered Joe, \"for a' t'other side o'  the ridge there's a bull _wallerin'_.\"    \"Ye don't mean it!\" exclaimed Dick, as they all dismounted and picketed  their horses to the plain.    \"Oui,\" said Henri, tumbling off his horse, while a broad grin overspread  his good-natured countenance; \"it is one fact!  One buffalo bull be  wollerin' like a enormerous hog.  Also, dere be t'ousands o' buffaloes  farder on.\"    \"Can ye trust yer dog keepin' back?\" inquired Joe, with a dubious glance  at Crusoe.    \"Trust him!  Ay, I wish I was as sure o' myself.\"    \"Look to your primin', then, an' we'll have tongues and marrow-bones for  supper to-night, I'se warrant.  Hist! down on yer knees, and go softly.  We might ha' run them down on horseback, but its bad to wind yer beasts  on a trip like this, if ye can help it; an' it's about as easy to stalk  them.  Leastways, we'll try.  Lift yer head slowly, Dick, an' don't show  more nor the half o't above the ridge.\"    Dick elevated his head as directed, and the scene that met his view was  indeed well calculated to send an electric shock to the heart of an  ardent sportsman.  The vast plain beyond was absolutely blackened with  countless herds of buffaloes, which were browsing on the rich grass.  They were still so far distant that their bellowing, and the trampling  of their myriad hoofs, only reached the hunters like a faint murmur on  the breeze.  In the immediate foreground, however, there was a group of  about half a dozen buffalo cows feeding quietly, and in the midst of  them an enormous old bull was enjoying himself in his wallow.  The  animals, towards which our hunters now crept with murderous intent, are  the fiercest and the most ponderous of the ruminating inhabitants of the  western wilderness.  The name of buffalo, however, is not correct.  The  animal is the _bison_, and bears no resemblance whatever to the buffalo  proper; but as the hunters of the far west--and, indeed, travellers  generally, have adopted the misnomer, we bow to the authority of custom  and adopt it too.    Buffaloes roam in countless thousands all over the North American  prairies, from the Hudson's Bay territories, north of Canada, to the  shores of the Gulf of Mexico.    The advance of white men to the west has driven them to the prairies  between the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains, and has somewhat  diminished their numbers; but even thus diminished, they are still  innumerable in the more distant plains.  Their colour is dark brown, but  it varies a good deal with the seasons.  The hair or fur, from its great  length in winter and spring and exposure to the weather, turns quite  light; but when the winter coat is shed off the new growth is a  beautiful dark brown, almost approaching to jet-black.  In form the  buffalo somewhat resembles the ox, but its head and shoulders are much  larger, and are covered with a profusion of long shaggy hair, which adds  greatly to the fierce aspect of the animal.  It has a large hump on the  shoulder, and its fore-quarters are much larger, in proportion, than the  hindquarters.  The horns are short and thick; the hoofs are cloven, and  the tail is short, with a tuft of hair at the extremity.    It is scarcely possible to conceive a wilder or more ferocious and  terrible monster than a buffalo bull.  He often grows to the enormous  weight of two thousand pounds.  His lion-like mane falls in shaggy  confusion quite over his head and shoulders, down to the ground.  When  he is wounded he becomes imbued with the spirit of a tiger; he stamps,  bellows, roars, and foams forth his rage with glaring eyes and steaming  nostrils; and charges furiously at man and horse with utter  recklessness.  Fortunately, however, he is not naturally pugnacious, and  can be easily thrown into a sudden panic.  Moreover, the peculiar  position of his eye renders this creature not so terrible as he would  otherwise be to the hunter.  Owing to the stiff structure of the neck,  and the sunken, downward-looking eyeball, the buffalo cannot, without an  effort, see beyond the direct line of vision presented to the habitual  carriage of his head.  When, therefore, he is wounded, and charges, he  does so in a straight line, so that his pursuer can leap easily out of  his way.  The pace of the buffalo is clumsy, and _apparently_ slow, yet,  when chased, he dashes away over the plains in blind blundering terror,  at a rate that leaves all but good horses far behind.  He cannot keep  the pace up, however, and is usually soon overtaken.  Were the buffalo  capable of the same alert and agile motions of head and eye peculiar to  the deer or wild horse, in addition to his \"bovine rage,\" he would be  the most formidable brute on earth.  There is no object, perhaps, so  terrible as the headlong advance of a herd of these animals when  thoroughly aroused by terror.  They care not for their necks.  All  danger in front is forgotten, or not seen, in the terror of that from  which they fly.  No thundering cataract is more tremendously  irresistible than the black bellowing torrent which sometimes pours  through the narrow defiles of the Rocky Mountains, or sweeps like a  roaring flood over the trembling plains.    The wallowing, to which we have referred, is a luxury usually indulged  in during the hot months of summer, when the buffaloes are tormented by  flies, and heat, and drought.  At this season they seek the low grounds  in the prairies where there is a little stagnant water lying amongst the  grass, and the ground underneath, being saturated, is soft.  The leader  of the herd, a shaggy old bull, usually takes upon himself to prepare  the wallow.    It was a rugged monster of the largest size that did so on the present  occasion, to the intense delight of Dick Varley, who begged Joe to lie  still and watch the operation before trying to shoot one of the buffalo  cows.  Joe consented with a nod, and the four spectators--for Crusoe was  as much taken up with the proceedings as any of them--crouched in the  grass, and looked on.    Coming up to the swampy spot the old bull gave a grunt of satisfaction,  and, going down on one knee, plunged his short thick horns into the mud,  tore it up, and cast it aside.  Having repeated this several times he  plunged his head in, and brought it forth saturated with dirty water,  and bedaubed with lumps of mud, through which his fierce eyes gazed,  with a ludicrous expression of astonishment, straight in the direction  of the hunters, as if he meant to say, \"I've done it that time, and no  mistake!\"  The other buffaloes seemed to think so too, for they came up  and looked, on with an expression that seemed to say, \"Well done, old  fellow; try that again!\"    The old fellow did try it again, and again, and again, plunging, and  ramming, and tearing up the earth, until he formed an excavation large  enough to contain his huge body.  In this bath he laid himself  comfortably down, and began to roll and wallow about until he mixed up a  trough full of thin soft mud, which completely covered him.  When he  came out of the hole there was scarcely an atom of his former self  visible!    The coat of mud thus put on by bulls is usually permitted by them to  dry, and is not finally got rid of until long after, when oft-repeated  rollings on the grass and washings by rain at length clear it away.    When the old bull vacated this delectable bath, another bull, scarcely,  if at all, less ferocious-looking, stepped forward to take his turn, but  he was interrupted by a volley from the hunters, which scattered the  animals right and left, and sent the mighty herds in the distance flying  over the prairie in wild terror.  The very turmoil of their own mad  flight added to their panic, and the continuous thunder of their hoofs  was heard until the last of them disappeared on the horizon.  The family  party which had been fired at, however, did not escape so well.  Joe's  rifle wounded a fat young cow, and Dick Varley brought it down.  Henri  had done his best, but, as the animals were too far distant for his  limited vision, he missed the cow he fired at and hit the young bull  whose bath had been interrupted.  The others scattered and fled.    \"Well done, Dick,\" exclaimed Joe Blunt, as they all ran up to the cow  that had fallen.  \"Your first shot at the buffalo was a good 'un.  Come  now an I'll show ye how to cut it up an' carry off the titbits.\"    \"Ah! mon dear ole bull,\" exclaimed Henri, gazing after the animal which  he had wounded, and which was now limping slowly away.  \"You is not  worth goin' after.  Varewell,--adieu.\"    \"He'll be tough enough, I warrant,\" said Joe, \"an' we've more meat here  nor we can lift.\"    \"But wouldn't it be as well to put the poor brute out o' pain?\"  suggested Dick.    \"Oh, he'll die soon enough,\" replied Joe, tucking up his sleeves and  drawing his long hunting-knife.    Dick, however, was not satisfied with this way of looking at it.  Saying  that he would be back in a few minutes he re-loaded his rifle, and  calling Crusoe to his side, walked quickly after the wounded bull, which  was now hid from view in a hollow of the plain.    In a few minutes he came in sight of it, and ran forward with his rifle  in readiness.    \"Down, Crusoe,\" he whispered; \"wait for me here.\"    Crusoe crouched in the grass instantly, and Dick advanced.  As he came  on, the bull observed him, and turned round bellowing with rage and pain  to receive him.  The aspect of the brute on a near view was so terrible,  that Dick involuntarily stopped too, and gazed with a mingled feeling of  wonder and awe, while it bristled with passion, and blood-streaked foam  dropped from its open jaws, and its eyes glared furiously.  Seeing that  Dick did not advance, the bull charged"]]]
