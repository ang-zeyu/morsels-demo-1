Second circle of the spirits of wise religious men,  doctors of the Church and teachers.--St. Bonaventura narrates the  life of St. Dominic, and tells the names of those who form the  circle with him.    Soon as the blessed flame uttered the last word of its speech the  holy mill-stone[1] began to rotate, and had not wholly turned in  its gyration before another enclosed it with a circle, and  matched motion with motion, song with song; song which in those  sweet pipes so surpasses our Muses, our Sirens, as a primal  splendor that which it reflects.[2] As two bows parallel and of  like colors are turned across a thin cloud when Juno gives the  order to her handmaid[3] (the outer one born of that within,  after the manner of the speech of that wandering one[4] whom love  consumed, as the sun does vapors), and make the people here  presageful, because of the covenant which God established with  Noah concerning the world, that it is nevermore to be flooded; so  the two garlands of those sempiternal roses turned around us, and  so the outer responded to the inner. After the dance and the  other great festivity, alike of the singing and of the flaming,  light with light joyous and courteous, had become quiet together  at an instant and with one will (just as the eyes which must  needs together close and open to the pleasure that moves them),  from the heart of one of the new lights a voice proceeded, which  made me seem as the needle to the star in turning me to its place  and it began,[5] \"The love which makes me beautiful draws me to  speak of the other leader by whom[6] so well has been spoken here  of mine. It is fit that where one is the other be led in, so that  as they served in war with one another, together likewise may  their glory shine.

[5] It is St. Bonaventura, the biographer of St. Francis, who  speaks. He became General of the Order in 1256, and died in 1276.    [6] By whom, through one of his brethren.      \"The army of Christ, which it had cost so dear to arm afresh,[1]  was moving slow, mistrustful, and scattered, behind the  standard,[2] when the Emperor who forever reigns provided for the  soldiery that was in peril, through grace alone, not because it  was worthy, and, as has been said, succored his Bride with two  champions, by whose deed, by whose word, the people gone astray  were rallied.    [1] The elect, who had lost grace through Adam's sin, were armed  afresh by the costly sacirifice of the Son of God.    [2] The Cross.      \"In that region where the sweet west wind rises to open the new  leaves wherewith Europe is seen to reclothe herself, not very far  from the beating of the waves behind which, over their long  course, the sun sometimes bides himself to all men, sits the  fortunate Callaroga, under the protection of the great shield on  which the Lion is subject and subjugates.[1] Therein was born the  amorous lover of the Christian faith, the holy athlete, benignant  to his own, and to his enemies harsh.[2] And when it was created,  his mind was so replete with living virtue, that in his mother it  made her a prophetess.[3] After the espousals between him and the  faith were completed at the sacred font, where they dowered each  other with mutual safety, the lady who gave the assent for him  saw in a dream the marvellous fruit which was to proceed from him  and from his heirs;[4] and in order that he might be spoken of  as he was,[5] a spirit went forth from here[6] to name him with  the possessive of Him whose he wholly was. Dominic[7] he was  called; and I speak of him as of the husbandman whom Christ  elected to his garden to assist him. Truly he seemed the  messenger and familiar of Christ; for the first love that was  manifest in him was for the first counsel that Christ gave.[8]  Oftentimes was he found by his nurse upon the ground silent and  awake, as though he said, 'I am come for this.' O father of him  truly Felix! Omother of him truly Joan, if this, being  interpreted, means as is said![9]    [1] The shield of Castile, on which two lions and two castles are  quartered, one lion below and one above.    [2] St. Dominic, born in 1170.    [3] His mother dreamed that she gave birth to a dog, black and  white in color, with a lighted torch in its mouth, which set the  world on fire; symbols of the black and white robe of the Order,  and of the flaming zeal of its brethren. Hence arose a play of  words on their name, Domini cani, \"the dogs of the Lord.\"    [4] The godmother of Dominic saw in dream a star on the forehead  and another on the back of the head of the child, signifying the  light that should stream from him over East and West.    [5] That his name might express his nature.    [6] From heaven.

Then with doctrine and with will, together with the  apostolic office,[8] he went forth like a torrent which a lofty  vein pours out, and on the heretical stocks his onset smote with  most vigor there where the resistance was the greatest. From him  proceeded thereafter divers streams wherewith the catholic garden  is watered, so that its bushes stand more living.    [1] The goods of this world.    [2] Henry of Susa, cardinal of Ostia, who wrote a much studied  commentary on the Decretals, and Thaddeus of Bologna, who, says  Giovanni Villani, \"was the greatest physician in Christendom.\"  The thought is the same as that at the beginning of Canto XI,  where Dante speaks of \"one following the Laws, and one the  Aphorisms.\"    [3] The Papal chair.

If such was one wheel of the chariot on which the Holy Church  defended itself and vanquished in the field its civil strife,[1]  surely the excellence of the other should be very plain to thee,  concerning which Thomas before my coming was so courteous. But  the track which the highest part of its circumference made is  derelict;[2] So that the mould is where the crust was.[3] His  household, which set forth straight with their feet upon his  footprints, are so turned round that they set the forward foot on  that behind;[4] and soon the quality of the barvest of this bad  culture shall be seen, when the tare will complain that the chest  is taken from it.[5] Yet I say, he who should search our volume  leaf by leaf might still find a page where he would read, 'I am  that which I am wont:' but it will not be from Casale nor from  Acquasparta,[6] whence such come unto the Written Rule that one  flies from it, and the other contracts it.    [1] The heresies within its own borders.    [2] The track made by St. Francis is deserted.    [3] The change of metaphor is sudden; good wine makes a crust,  bad wine mould in the cask.

The fryers easily consented, and the  Conqueror as soon sent back his army, which, that night, according to  agreement, were let into the priory by the two fryers, by which they  immediately made themselves masters of all York; after which Sir  Robert Clifford, who was governor thereof, was so far from being  blamed by the Conqueror for his stout defence made the preceding days,  that he was highly esteemed and rewarded for his valour, being created  Lord Clifford, and there knighted, with the four magistrates then in  office--viz., Horongate, Talbot (who after came to be Lord Talbott),  Lassells, and Erringham.    \"The Arms of the City of York at that time was, _argent_, a cross,  _gules_, viz. St. George's Cross. The Conqueror charged the cross with  five lyons, passant gardant, _or_, in memory of the five worthy  captains, magistrates, who governed the city so well, that he  afterwards made Sir Robert Clifford governour thereof, and the other  four to aid him in counsell; and, the better to keep the City in  obedience, he built two castles, and double-moated them about; and, to  shew the confidence and trust he put in these old but new-made  officers by him, he offered them freely to ask whatsoever they would  of him before he went, and he would grant their request; wherefore  they (abominating the treachery of the two fryers to their eternal  infamy), desired that, on St. Thomas's Day, for ever, they might have  a fryer of the priory of St. Peter's to ride through the city on  horseback, with his face to the horse's tayle: and that, in his hand,  instead of a bridle, he should have a rope, and in the other a  shoulder of mutton, with one cake hanging on his back and another on  his breast, with his face painted like a Jew; and the youth of the  City to ride with him, and to cry and shout 'Youl, Youl!' with the  officers of the City riding before and making proclamation, that on  this day the City was betrayed; and their request was granted them;  which custom continued till the dissolution of the said fryory; and  afterwards, in imitation of the same, the young men and artizans of  the City, on the aforesaid St. Thomas's day, used to dress up one of  their own companions like a fryer, and call him Youl, which custom  continued till within these threescore years, there being many now  living which can testify the same. But upon what occasion since  discontinued, I cannot learn; this being done in memory of betraying  the City by the said fryers to William the Conqueror.\"    St. Thomas's day used to be utilised in laying in store of food at  Christ-tide for the purpose of properly keeping the feast of the  Nativity. In the Isle of Man it was the custom for the people to go on  that day to the mountains in order to capture deer and sheep for the  feast; and at night bonfires blazed on the summit of every \"fingan,\"  or cliff, to provide for which, at the time of casting peats, every  person put aside a large one, saying, \"Faaid mooar moaney son oie'l  fingan\"--that is, _A large turf for Fingan's Eve_.    Beef was sometimes left to the parish by deceased benefactors, as in  the case of Boteler's Bull Charity at Biddenham, Bedfordshire, of  which Edwards says:[17] \"This is an ancient annual payment of L5 out  of an estate at Biddenham, formerly belonging to the family of  Boteler, and now the property of Lord Viscount Hampden, which is due  and regularly paid on St. Thomas's Day to the overseers of the poor,  and is applicable by the terms of the original gift (of which no  written memorial is to be found), or by long-established usage, to the  purchase of a bull, which is killed and the flesh thereof given among  the poor persons of the parish.    [Footnote 17: _A Collection of Old English Customs and Curious  Bequests and Charities_, London, 1842, p. 64.]    \"For many years past, the annual fund being insufficient to purchase a  bull, the deficiency has been made good out of other charities  belonging to the parish. It was proposed some years ago by the vicar  that the L5 a year should be laid out in buying meat, but the poor  insisted on the customary purchase of a bull being continued, and the  usage is, accordingly, kept up. The price of the bull has varied of  late years from L9 to L14. The Churchwardens, Overseers, and principal  inhabitants assist at the distribution of the meat.\"    He gives another instance[18] of a gift of beef and barley at Nevern,  Pembrokeshire: \"William Rogers, by will, June 1806, gave to the  Minister and Churchwardens of Nevern and their successors L800 three  per cent. Consols, to be transferred by his executors within six  months after his decease; and it was his will that the dividends  should be laid out annually, one moiety thereof in good beef, the  other moiety in good barley, the same to be distributed on every St.  Thomas's Day in every year by the Minister and Churchwardens, to and  among the poor of the said parish of Nevern.    [Footnote 18: _A Collection of Old English Customs and Curious  Bequests and Charities_, London, 1842, p. 24.]    \"After the payment of L1 to a solicitor in London, and a small amount  for a stamp and postage, the dividends (L24) are expended in the  purchase of beef and barley, which is distributed by the Churchwarden  on 21st December to all the poor of the parish, in shares of between  two and three gallons of barley, and between two and three pounds of  beef.\"    Yet another example of Christmas beef for the poor--this time rather  an unpleasant one:[19] \"The cruel practice of bull-baiting was  continued annually on St. Thomas's Day in the quaint old town of  Wokingham, Berks, so lately as 1821. In 1822, upon the passing of the  Act against cruelty to Animals, the Corporation resolved on abolishing  the custom. The alderman (as the chief Magistrate is called there)  went with his officers in procession and solemnly pulled up the  bull-ring, which had, from immemorial time been fixed in the  market-place. The bull-baiting was regarded with no ordinary  attachment by 'the masses'; for, besides the love of 'sport,' however  barbarous, it was here connected with something more solid--the  Christmas dinner.    [Footnote 19: _Notes and Queries_, second series, v. 35.]    \"In 1661, George Staverton gave by will, out of his Staines house,  four pounds to buy a bull for the use of the poor of Wokingham parish,  to be increased to six pounds after the death of his wife and her  daughter; the bull to be baited, and then cut up, 'one poor's piece  not exceeding another's in bigness.' Staverton must have been an  amateur of the bull-bait; for he exhorts his wife, if she can spare  her four pounds a-year, to let the poor have the bull at Christmas  next after his decease, and so forward.    \"Great was the wrath of the populace in 1822 at the loss, not of the  beef--for the corporation duly distributed the meat--but of the  baiting. They vented their rage for successive years in occasional  breaches of the peace. They found out--often informed by the  sympathising farmer or butcher--where the devoted animal was  domiciled; proceeded at night to liberate him from stall or meadow,  and to chase him across the country with all the noisy accompaniments  imaginable. So long was this feeling kept alive, that thirteen years  afterwards--viz. in 1835--the mob broke into the place where one of  the two animals to be divided was abiding, and baited him, in defiance  of the authorities, in the market-place; one enthusiastic amateur,  tradition relates, actually lying on the ground and seizing the  miserable brute by the nostril, _more canino_, with his own human  teeth! This was not to be endured, and a sentence of imprisonment in  Reading Gaol gave the _coup de grace_ to the sport. The bequest of  Staverton now yields an income of L20, and has for several years past  been appropriated to the purchase of two bulls. The flesh is divided,  and distributed annually on St. Thomas's Day, by the alderman,  churchwardens, and overseers to nearly every poor family (between 200  and 300), without regard to their receiving parochial relief. The  produce of the offal and hides is laid out in the purchase of shoes  and stockings for the poor women and children. The bulls' tongues are  recognised by courtesy as the perquisites of the alderman and  town-clerk.\"    But there were other kindly gifts to the poor, _vide_ one at  Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire, where Samuel Higgs,[20] by his will dated  May 11, 1820 (as appears from the church tablet), gave L50 to the  vicar and churchwardens of this parish, and directed that the interest  should be given every year on 21st December, in equal proportions, to  ten poor men and women who could repeat the Lord's Prayer, the Creed,  and the Ten Commandments before the vicar or such other person as he  should appoint to hear them. The interest is applied according to the  donor's orders, and the poor persons appointed to partake of the  charity continue to receive it during their lives.
