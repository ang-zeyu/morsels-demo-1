[Sidenote: Kinds of Sewing]    The sewing done on wool, silk, and dresses of all kinds differs from  that on underwear and white work. Muslin underwear requires frequent  washing and ironing, hence the first essential is durability; close,  small stitches, all raw edges carefully turned and stitched securely.  Seams that are to come close to the body should lie perfectly flat. A  round seam would wear out sooner by coming into frequent contact with  the washboard and iron, besides irritating the skin. In dressmaking,  unless the stitching is used for ornamental purposes, it should never  show on the outside.    Periods of beautiful and dignified costume have been periods of fine  needlework--one art leading to and helping on the production of the  other.    [Sidenote: Plain Stitches]    Stitches may be divided into plain and ornamental. The plain stitches  are the (1) basting, (2) running, (3) the running and back stitch, (4)  half back stitch, (5) back stitch, (6) overhand or whipping stitch, (7)  overcast, (8) hemming, and (9) blind or slip stitch.    [Sidenote: Ornamental Stitches]    The ornamental stitches most frequently used are (1) outline, (2) chain,  (3) cat or herringbone, (4) blanket or loop, (5) feather, coral or  briar, (6) hemstitching, (7) French knots, (8) button hole, and (9)  cross stitch. Excepting the cross stitch, these are all variations of  the plain and button hole stitches.    The plain stitches may be used for ornamental purposes. The basting  stitch is known as Queen Anne darned work. The back stitch, known as  \"seed work,\" is used in embroidering letters and monograms. The overhand  stitch is used as an ornamental stitch for joining selvages and in  hemming. The chain stitch, besides being ornamental, makes one of the  best darning stitches, reproducing the stitch in knitting. The cat  stitch is also useful in binding down open seams for flannel hems,  patching, etc.    [Sidenote: Basting]    (1) Basting proper is used only in the preparation of work to hold the  stuff and lining, or any two or more parts of the work together while it  is being stitched, none being left in the finished garment. It is also  used as a guide for sewing, feather stitching, etc.    [Sidenote: Tacking]    The slanting basting stitch or \"tacking\" is used in dressmaking for  holding linings. The needle is pointed towards the worker. Even basting  is used for holding several thicknesses of cloth and if the garment is  to be fitted, the stitches should be placed rather close. Uneven basting  is used for hems and seams to be machine stitched. Several short  stitches with one long one are used to baste crape and wiry fabrics,  for this method holds them better than stitches of equal length.      [Illustration: BASTING STITCHES    _a_--Even; _b_--Uneven; _c_--For wiry fabrics; _d_--Tacking;  _e_--Overcasting; _f_--Double or tailor overcasting.]      [Sidenote: Fastening the Thread]    All basting should be fastened at start with a knot or knot and back  stitch and finished with two or three back stitches. The length of  thread may be broken or cut from the spool, but should always be cut  from the work. Breaking weakens the fastening and biting off soils  delicate work with the moisture from the breath, to say nothing of the  injury to the teeth. Basting for large work should usually be done with  the goods lying flat on the sewing table.    [Sidenote: Drawing Basting Threads]    For ordinary work, basting threads should be cut every few inches and  drawn out. In velvet, every alternate stitch should be cut and drawn out  on the right side with the pile of the goods. In the basting for velvet  where the slanting stitch is used, only one end of the stitch touches  the line of the seam--the rest is on the outside of the seam. Silk  thread should be used to baste velvet and gauze; the thread should be  used for basting.      [Illustration: POSITION OF THE HANDS IN RUNNING]      [Sidenote: Running Stitch]    (2) Running is closely related to basting. It is not used for any seams  that have to bear great strain, but for joining seams in this material,  gathering, tucking, making cords, etc. The stitches are usually of equal  length on both sides. Take one stitch in the seam and hold the goods  between the thumb and first finger of each hand, as shown in the  illustration, with the back of the thimble on the eye of the needle.  Then, with as free wrist motion as possible, run or shake the needle  through the material. The motion of the hand should come from the elbow  joint.    Gathering, gauging, casing, etc., are used for drawing up the fullness  of skirts, ruffles, flounces, etc., into a given space. The running  stitch is used for these.    [Sidenote: Gathering]    For gathering, the cloth is held in the same manner as for running. The  needle, ordinarily, need not be taken out of the work, the stitches  being pushed back over the eye as they are made; but for running long  skirt seams in delicate material which would crinkle at the line of  sewing and roughen the seam, the needle should be drawn through and the  line of sewing smoothed on the thread at each needleful of stitches.    [Sidenote: Stroking]    Never use a double thread for gathering, as it is apt to knot, but put  in two lines of gathering threads--one a full one-eighth of an inch  below the other--and slip the stitches along the needle as described  above. This method is a saving of time in the end. When the gathering  threads are in, remove the needle, place a pin vertically close to the  last stitch, and wind the thread around it a few times in the form of a  figure eight. Use a coarse needle for stroking. Hold the work between  the thumb and fingers of the left hand with the thumb on the gathering  threads. To place the gathers, put the point of the needle _under_ the  lower gathering thread and press the plait or gather under the thumb,  drawing the needle down, or simply pressing on the needle. Care must be  taken not to scratch or tear the material. Continue entirely across the  gathers, putting the needle under each stitch and holding the plait  firmly between the thumb and finger: turn the material and stroke the  _upper_ edge of the gathers.    [Sidenote: Gauging]    The gauging stitch is usually longer on the face than on the back, draws  the material up into distinct plaits, making it easy to dispose of the  fullness neatly, regularly and securely by overhanding the top edge of  each plait to the bottom edge of the band. The right side of the skirt  and the right side of the belt are placed against each other and each  gather oversewed to the belt. The space into which the material is to be  gathered determines the length of the long stitch. The succeeding rows  of stitches should be _directly_ under those of the first.    [Sidenote: Running and Back Stitch]    (3) The running and back stitch is made by taking a few running  stitches, drawing out the needle and making a back stitch over the last  running stitch to strengthen the seam. Care must be taken not to hold  the side next the worker too full and not to miss the under material,  but to take the stitches even on both sides.    [Sidenote: Half Back Stitch]    (4) The half-back stitch is made by taking one stitch and placing the  needle half way back, then bringing it out twice the length of the  stitch and placing the needle half way back each time from where the  last stitch ended. The appearance on the right side will be of regular  space as in the running stitch.    [Sidenote: Back Stitch]    (5) The back stitch is made by placing the needle back to the last  stitch, bringing it out once the length of the last stitch, then placing  the needle back into the last stitch, and so on, making the stitches  follow each other without any space between. This is used in all places  that are to bear great strain.      [Illustration: PLAIN STITCHES _a_--Running; _b_--Running and back;  _c_--Half back; _d_--Back stitch.]      [Sidenote: Whipping Stitch]    (6) Overhanding, oversewing, whipping, top sewing are one and the  same--small stitches taken over edges, to join folded edges or selvages,  for sewing bands on gathers, sewing lace and insertion, and for sewing  carpet strips together. The pieces for an overhand seam should be pinned  carefully, placing the pins at right angles to the edge. The folded  edges or selvages are placed together, the right side of the goods  being in. Do not use a knot to begin sewing, but leave the knot end of  the thread and sew it in with the first stitches, carrying the thread on  top of the seam. To finish off the seam, overhand back over the last few  stitches.    [Sidenote: Position in Overhanding]    In sewing this seam, the goods should be held between the thumb and  first finger of the left hand parallel with the chest, not over the end  of finger. Point the needle towards the left shoulder, thus giving a  slanting stitch. Care should be taken not to pucker or draw the seam.

She has shewn me all her secrets, and learned me to  wash gaze, and refrash rusty silks and bumbeseens, by boiling them with  winegar, chamberlye, and stale beer. My short sack and apron luck as  good as new from the shop, and my pumpydoor as fresh as a rose, by  the help of turtle-water--But this is all Greek and Latten to you,  Molly--If we should come to Aberga'ny, you'll be within a day's ride of  us; and then we shall see wan another, please God--If not, remember  me in your prayers, as I shall do by you in mine; and take care of my  kitten, and give my kind sarvice to Sall; and this is all at present,  from your beloved friend and sarvent,    W. JENKINS BATH, April 26.          To Mrs GWYLLIM, house-keeper at Brambleton-hall.    I am astonished that Dr Lewis should take upon him to give away  Alderney, without my privity and concurrants--What signifies my  brother's order? My brother is little better than Noncompush. He would  give away the shirt off his back, and the teeth out of his head; nay, as  for that matter; he would have ruinated the family with his ridiculous  charities, if it had not been for my four quarters--What between his  willfullness and his waste, his trumps, and his frenzy, I lead the life  of an indented slave. Alderney gave four gallons a-day, ever since the  calf was sent to market. There is so much milk out of my dairy, and the  press must stand still: but I won't loose a cheese pairing; and the milk  shall be made good, if the sarvents should go without butter. If they  must needs have butter, let them make it of sheep's milk; but then my  wool will suffer for want of grace; so that I must be a loser on all  sides. Well, patience is like a stout Welsh poney; it bears a great  deal, and trots a great way; but it will tire at the long run. Before  its long, perhaps I may shew Matt, that I was not born to be the  household drudge to my dying day--Gwyn rites from Crickhowel, that the  price of flannel is fallen three-farthings an ell; and that's another  good penny out of my pocket. When I go to market to sell, my commodity  stinks; but when I want to buy the commonest thing, the owner pricks  it up under my nose; and it can't be had for love nor money--I think  everything runs cross at Brambleton-hall--You say the gander has broke  the eggs; which is a phinumenon I don't understand: for when the fox  carried off the old goose last year, he took her place, and hatched the  eggs, and partected the goslings like a tender parent--Then you tell me  the thunder has soured two barrels of beer in the seller. But how the  thunder should get there, when the seller was double-locked, I can't  comprehend. Howsomever, I won't have the beer thrown out, till I see it  with my own eyes. Perhaps, it will recover--At least it will serve for  vinegar to the servants.--You may leave off the fires in my brother's  chamber and mine, as it is unsartain when we return.--I hope, Gwyllim,  you'll take care there is no waste; and have an eye to the maids, and  keep them to their spinning. I think they may go very well without beer  in hot weather--it serves only to inflame the blood, and set them  a-gog after the men. Water will make them fair and keep them cool and  tamperit. Don't forget to put up in the portmantel, that cums with  Williams, along with my riding-habit, hat, and feather, the viol of purl  water, and the tincktur for my stomach; being as how I am much troubled  with flutterencies. This is all at present, from    Yours, TABITHA BRAMBLE BATH, April 26.          To Dr LEWIS.    DEAR DICK,    I have done with the waters; therefore your advice comes a day too late  I grant that physic is no mystery of your making. I know it is a mystery  in its own nature; and, like other mysteries, requires a strong gulp of  faith to make it go down--Two days ago, I went into the King's Bath,  by the advice of our friend Ch--, in order to clear the strainer of the  skin, for the benefit of a free perspiration; and the first object that  saluted my eye, was a child full of scrophulous ulcers, carried in the  arms of one of the guides, under the very noses of the bathers. I was  so shocked at the sight, that I retired immediately with indignation  and disgust--Suppose the matter of those ulcers, floating on the water,  comes in contact with my skin, when the pores are all open, I would ask  you what must be the consequence?--Good Heaven, the very thought makes  my blood run cold! we know not what sores may be running into the water  while we are bathing, and what sort of matter we may thus imbibe; the  king's-evil, the scurvy, the cancer, and the pox; and, no doubt, the  heat will render the virus the more volatile and penetrating. To purify  myself from all such contamination, I went to the duke of Kingston's  private Bath, and there I was almost suffocated for want of free air;  the place was so small, and the steam so stifling.    After all, if the intention is no more than to wash the skin, I  am convinced that simple element is more effectual than any water  impregnated with salt and iron; which, being astringent, will certainly  contract the pores, and leave a kind of crust upon the surface of the  body. But I am now as much afraid of drinking, as of bathing; for, after  a long conversation with the Doctor, about the construction of the  pump and the cistern, it is very far from being clear with me, that the  patients in the Pump-room don't swallow the scourings of the bathers. I  can't help suspecting, that there is, or may be, some regurgitation from  the bath into the cistern of the pump. In that case, what a delicate  beveridge is every day quaffed by the drinkers; medicated with the sweat  and dirt, and dandriff; and the abominable discharges of various kinds,  from twenty different diseased bodies, parboiling in the kettle below.  In order to avoid this filthy composition, I had recourse to the spring  that supplies the private baths on the Abbey-green; but I at once  perceived something extraordinary in the taste and smell; and, upon  inquiry, I find that the Roman baths in this quarter, were found covered  by an old burying ground, belonging to the Abbey; through which, in all  probability, the water drains in its passage; so that as we drink the  decoction of living bodies at the Pump-room, we swallow the strainings  of rotten bones and carcasses at the private bath. I vow to God, the  very idea turns my stomach! Determined, as I am, against any farther use  of the Bath waters, this consideration would give me little disturbance,  if I could find any thing more pure, or less pernicious, to quench my  thirst; but, although the natural springs of excellent water are seen  gushing spontaneous on every side, from the hills that surround us, the  inhabitants, in general, make use of well-water, so impregnated with  nitre, or alum, or some other villainous mineral, that it is equally  ungrateful to the taste, and mischievous to the constitution. It must  be owned, indeed, that here, in Milsham-street, we have a precarious and  scanty supply from the hill; which is collected in an open bason in  the Circus, liable to be defiled with dead dogs, cats, rats, and every  species of nastiness, which the rascally populace may throw into it,  from mere wantonness and brutality. Well, there is no nation that drinks  so hoggishly as the English.    What passes for wine among us, is not the juice of the grape. It is an  adulterous mixture, brewed up of nauseous ingredients, by dunces,  who are bunglers in the art of poison-making; and yet we, and our  forefathers, are and have been poisoned by this cursed drench, without  taste or flavour--The only genuine and wholesome beveridge in England,  is London porter, and Dorchester table-beer; but as for your ale and  your gin, your cyder and your perry, and all the trashy family of  made wines, I detest them as infernal compositions, contrived for the  destruction of the human species--But what have I to do with the human  species? except a very few friends, I care not if the whole was--.    Heark ye, Lewis, my misanthropy increases every day--The longer I  live, I find the folly and the fraud of mankind grow more and more  intolerable--I wish I had not come from Brambletonhall; after having  lived in solitude so long, I cannot bear the hurry and impertinence of  the multitude; besides, every thing is sophisticated in these crowded  places. Snares are laid for our lives in every thing we cat or drink:  the very air we breathe, is loaded with contagion. We cannot even  sleep, without risque of infection. I say, infection--This place is  the rendezvous of the diseased--You won't deny, that many diseases are  infectious; even the consumption itself, is highly infectious. When a  person dies of it in Italy, the bed and bedding are destroyed; the other  furniture is exposed to the weather and the apartment white-washed,  before it is occupied by any other living soul. You'll allow, that  nothing receives infection sooner, or retains it longer, than blankets,  feather-beds, and matrasses--'Sdeath! how do I know what miserable  objects have been stewing in the bed where I now lie!--I wonder, Dick,  you did not put me"]]]
