As a fact, the original traits persist with  almost incredible fidelity. (Appendix C.)    In 1911, Franz Boas of Columbia University published measurements of the  head form of children of immigrants[14] which purported to show that  American conditions caused in some mysterious manner a change in the  shape of the head. This conclusion in itself would have been striking  enough, but was made more startling when he announced that the change  worked both ways: \"The East European Hebrew, who has a very round head,  becomes more long-headed; the south Italian, who in Italy has an  exceedingly long head, becomes more short-headed\"; and moreover this  potent influence was alleged to be a subtle one \"which does not affect  the young child born abroad and growing up in American environment, but  which makes itself felt among the children born in America, even a short  time after the arrival of the parents in this country.\" Boas' work was  naturally pleasing to sociologists who believe in the reality of the  \"melting-pot,\" and has obtained widespread acceptance in popular  literature. It has obtained little acceptance among his  fellow-anthropologists, some of whom allege that it is unsound because  of the faulty methods by which the measurements were made and the  incorrect standards used for comparison.    The many instances quoted by historians, where races have changed after  immigration, are to be explained in most cases by natural selection  under new conditions, or by interbreeding with the natives, and not as  the direct result of climate. Ellsworth Huntington, the most recent and  careful student of the effect of climate on man,[15] finds that climate  has a great deal of influence on man's energy, but as far as inherited  traits in general are concerned, he is constantly led to remark how  little heredity is capable of being changed.    Most members of the white race have little toes that are partly  atrophied, and considerably deformed. In many cases one of the joints  has undergone ankylosis--that is, the bones have coalesced. It is  confidently alleged that this is due to the inheritance of the effects  of wearing tight shoes through many centuries. When it is found that the  prehistoric Egyptians, who knew not tight shoes, suffered from the same  defect in a similar degree, one's confidence in this kind of evidence is  much diminished.    The retrogression of the little toe in man is probably to be explained  like the degeneration of the hind leg of the whale, as a result of the  excess of deteriorating variations which, when not eliminated by natural  selection, lead to atrophy. Since man began to limit the use of his feet  to walking on the ground, the little toe has had much less value to him.    The feet of Chinese women offer another illustration along this line.  Although they have been tightly bound for many generations, no deformity  is apparent in the feet of girl babies.    Breeders are generally of the opinion that good care and feed bestowed  on their stock produce results in succeeding generations. This is in a  way true, but it is due merely to the fact that the offspring get better  nourishment and therefore a better start in life. The changes in breeds,  the increase in milk yield, and similar facts, often explained as due to  inheritance of acquired characters, are better explained as the results  of selection, sometimes conscious, sometimes quite unconscious.    [Illustration: BOUND FOOT OF A CHINESE WOMAN    FIG. 5.--For centuries the feet of upper class women, and many  lower class women, in China have been distorted in this manner; but  their daughters have perfect feet when born.]    [Illustration: DEFECTIVE LITTLE TOE OF A PREHISTORIC EGYPTIAN    FIG. 6.--The above illustration shows the foot of a prehistoric  Egyptian who is estimated to have lived about 8000 B. C. The last joint  of the little toe had entirely disappeared, and careful dissection  leaves no doubt that it was a germinal abnormality, such as is  occasionally seen to-day, and not the result of disease. It is,  therefore, evident that the degeneration of man's little toe must be  ascribed to some more natural cause than the wearing of shoes for many  generations. Photograph from Dr. Gorgy Sobhy, School of Medicine,  Cairo.]    The question of inherited immunity to diseases, as the result of  vaccination or actual illness from them, has appeared in the controversy  in a number of forms, and is a point of much importance. It is not yet  clear, partly because the doctors disagree as to what immunity is. But  there is no adequate evidence that an immunity to anything can be  created and transmitted through the germ-plasm to succeeding  generations.    In short, no matter what evidence we examine, we must conclude that  inheritance of acquired bodily characters is not a subject that need be  reckoned with, in applied eugenics.    On the other hand, there is a possible indirect influence of  modifications, which may have real importance in man. If the individual  is modified in a certain way, in a number of generations, even though  such a modification is not transmitted to his descendants, yet its  continued existence may make possible, the survival of some germinal  variation bearing in the same direction, which without the protecting  influence of the pre-existing modification, would have been swamped or  destroyed.    Finally, it should be borne in mind that even if physical and mental  characters acquired during a man's lifetime are not transmitted, yet  there is a sort of transmission of acquired characters which has been of  immense importance to the evolution of the race. This is the so-called  \"inheritance\" of the environment; the passing on from one generation to  the next of the achievements of the race, its accumulated social  experience; its civilization, in short. It is doubtful whether any  useful end is gained by speaking of this continuance of the environment  as \"heredity;\" it certainly tends to confuse many people who are not  used to thinking in biological terms. Tradition is the preferable term.    There is much to be said in favor of E. B. Poulton's  definition,--\"Civilization in general is the sum of those contrivances  which enable human beings to advance independently of heredity.\"  Whatever wisdom, material gain, or language is acquired by one  generation may be passed on to the next. As far as the environment is  concerned, one generation stands on the shoulders of its predecessor.  It might simplify the task of eugenics if the same could be said of  biological heredity. But it can not. Each generation must \"start from  scratch.\"    In August Weismann's words, the development of a function in offspring  begins at the point where it _began_ in his parents, not at the point  where it _ended_ in them. Biological improvement of the race (and such  improvement greatly fosters all other kinds) must be made through a  selective birth-rate. There is no short-cut by way of euthenics, merely.    We must now consider whether there is any direct way of impairing good  heredity. It is currently believed that there are certain substances,  popularly known as \"racial-poisons,\" which are capable of affecting the  germ-plasm adversely and permanently in spite of its isolation and  protection. For example, the literature of alcoholism, and much of the  literature of eugenics, abounds with statements to the effect that  alcohol _originates_ degeneracy in the human race.    The proof or disproof of this proposition must depend in the last  analysis on direct observation and carefully controlled experiments. As  the latter cannot be made feasibly on man, a number of students have  taken up the problem by using small animals which are easily handled in  laboratories. Many of these experiments are so imperfect in method that,  when carefully examined, they are found to possess little or no value as  evidence on the point here discussed.    Hodge, Mairet and Combemale, for example, have published data which  convinced them that the germ-plasm of dogs was injured by the  administration of alcohol. The test was the quality of offspring  directly produced by the intoxicated animals under experiment. But the  number of dogs used was too small to be conclusive, and there was no  \"control\": hence these experiments carry little weight.    Ovize, Fere and Stockard have shown that the effect of alcohol on hen's  eggs is to produce malformed embryos. This, however, is a case of  influencing the development of the individual, rather than the  germ-plasm. Evidence is abundant that individual development can be  harmed by alcohol, but the experiments with eggs are not to the point  of our present purpose.    Carlo Todde and others have carried out similar experiments on cocks.  The conclusions have in general been in favor of injury to the  germ-plasm, but the experiments were inadequate in extent.    Laitinen experimented on rabbits and guinea pigs, but he used small  doses and secured only negative results.    Several series of experiments with rats indicate that if the dosage is  large enough, the offspring can be affected.    Nice, using very small numbers of white mice, subjected them not only to  alcohol, but to caffein, nicotin, and tobacco smoke. The fecundity of  all these sets of mice was higher than that of the untreated ones used  as control; all of them gained in weight; of 707 young, none was  deformed, none stillborn, and there was only one abortion. The young of  the alcoholized mice surpassed all others in growth. The dosage Nice  employed was too small, however, to give his experiment great weight.    At the University of Wisconsin, Leon J. Cole has been treating male  rabbits with alcohol and reports that \"what appear to be decisive  results have already been obtained.

Let us go to the governor!\" they cried, as they moved  up the Linden; but they were attracted by a carriage, drawn by six fiery  horses at full gallop. It was the queen, who was about to leave the  capital. She looked even paler and sadder than before, and greeted her  friends on both sides with a heart-rending, melancholy smile. But they  had not time to greet even the queen, or to be surprised at her speedy  departure, as they rushed toward the house of the governor, Count  Schulenburg.    At his residence, also, the windows were covered up, and the gate of the  court-yard closed. But a large white handbill, containing a few lines in  gigantic letters, was posted on the side wall. Thousands of piercing  eyes were fixed on the paper, and an imperious demand was made to the  fortunate man who stood close to the handbill: \"Read! Read aloud!\"    \"I will read it!\" answered a loud, powerful voice. \"Be quiet, so as to  be able to hear me!\"    Profound silence reigned immediately, and every one heard distinctly  the words, which ran as follows:    \"_The king has lost a battle. Quiet is the citizen's first duty. I  request all the inhabitants of Berlin to maintain good order. The king  and his brothers are alive_.\"    The vast multitude burst into a wail of despair; and when silence  ensued, every one seemed paralyzed and stared mournfully at his  neighbor. Suddenly the side-gate of the count's court-yard opened, and a  carriage, followed by a large baggage-wagon, made its appearance.    At first, the people timidly stepped back, and looked on wonderingly.  But no sooner had they recognized in it the governor of Berlin, Count  von Schulenburg-Kehnert--no sooner had they discovered that his carriage  contained a large number of trunks and boxes, and that the wagon was  also filled with baggage, and had satisfied themselves that the governor  intended to leave the capital at this hour of terror, than attempts were  made to prevent him from setting out. The people stopped the horses, and  cried, in tones of exasperation, that it did not behoove the governor to  leave the city while it was in danger, and the inhabitants without  advice and protection.    Count Schulenburg rose in his carriage. Stretching out his arms in an  imperious manner, he demanded silence. When the clamor had ceased, he  said, in a conciliatory tone: \"My friends! duty calls me hence, for the  orders of the king must be obeyed. But you shall not say that I have  left the city of Berlin without adequate protection, and that I did not  devote my particular attention to its welfare. I have appointed my  son-in-law, the Prince von Hatzfeld, civil governor, and he will  zealously provide for the security and interests of the people of the  capital. Forward, coachman!\"    The coachman was about to comply with his master's orders, but some of  the crowd still dared to resist, and refused to let the horses proceed.    \"The governor must stay here!\" they shouted; \"it is incumbent on him not  to desert the inhabitants of Berlin, but to assist them in the hour of  danger!\"    \"In the hour of danger?\" asked the count, with a wondering air. \"Why, I  leave my whole family here--my children and grandchildren! Would I do so  if the enemy threatened the city?\"    No one could combat this argument, and reply to the governor's  question. The men, therefore, dropped the reins and fell back, when the  coachman whipped the horses into a gallop.    They gazed after the escaping count, and looked sadly at each other,  asking anxiously: \"What shall we do now? What shall we do when the  French come?\"    \"We will meet them sword in hand and drive them back!\" exclaimed a young  man, with a noble face.    \"Yes, we will do so,\" said another. \"There are no soldiers here; hence  we ourselves must look out for our own defence. We will form volunteer  companies, occupy the gates, and patrol the streets.\"    \"Our army being defeated, a new one has, of course, to be organized,\"  said another. \"We must do this; we must hand in our names, and enlist.  Let every one who thinks and feels like myself, follow me to the new  governor. We will apply to him for permission to organize ourselves for  the defence of the city. Come!\" Many hastened with ardent impetuosity  from all parts of the crowd to join him. Others, seized with admiration  and respect, opened a passage, through which the quickly-gathered  company of more than three hundred young men marched to the residence of  the Prince von Hatzfeld.    But he did not admit the deputation of these brave men. He sent word to  them, by his adjutant, that they would receive his definite reply at a  later hour. At present he wished them to go home, and avoid, above all,  any riotous proceedings in the streets.    The reply which the Prince von Hatzfeld had promised to the deputation  soon appeared on handbills posted at all the street corners. It was as  follows: \"It would be improper to conceal from the inhabitants of Berlin  that French troops may shortly occupy the capital. This unexpected event  cannot fail to produce a most painful impression among all classes. Only  the most implicit confidence in those who take upon themselves the  arduous task of alleviating the inevitable consequences of such an  event, as well as of maintaining order, which has become more desirable  than ever, will be able to avert the terrible fate which the slightest  resistance, or any disorderly conduct, would bring upon the city. The  course recently pursued by the inhabitants of Vienna, under similar  distressing circumstances, must have taught those of Berlin that the  conqueror only respects quiet and manly resignation after such a  defeat. Hence I forbid all gatherings and clamor in the streets, as well  as any public manifestation of sympathy in relation to the rumors from  the seat of war. For quiet submission is our first duty; we should only  think of what is going on within our own walls; it is the highest  interest to which we ought to devote our whole attention.\"          CHAPTER VI.    THE FAITHFUL PEOPLE OF STETTIN.      The hope of the queen had not been fulfilled. Her children had left  Stettin an hour before she reached the city.    \"I shall immediately continue my journey,\" said she, resolutely.    \"Your majesty, I beseech you to remain here,\" said Madame von Berg. \"You  have scarcely had any sleep for the last three nights; last night you  did not leave the carriage at all, and hardly took any food. Oh, think  of the king, of your children, and economize your strength! Take some  rest.\"    \"Rest!\" repeated the queen, with a melancholy smile. \"There will be,  perhaps, no more rest for me on earth! My heart is filled with  grief--how, then, can I sleep? But you have reminded me of my husband,  of my children, and you are right; I must live for them. Therefore, I  will stop here for an hour and take some refreshment, in order not to  give way under the heavy burden weighing down my mind. Come, we will  alight and go into the house.\"    Madame von Berg made a sign to the footman to open the coach door, and  followed Louisa into the royal villa, to the rooms usually occupied by  their majesties during their visits to Stettin. \"When I was last in this  room,\" whispered the queen, \"the king and the crown prince were with me.  There was nothing but joy in my heart. I was a happy wife, a happy  mother, and a happy queen! And, to-day, what am I?\" She heaved a  profound sigh, and, sinking down on the sofa, pressed her face upon the  cushions. \"Into what an abyss I have been hurled from my heaven!\" she  murmured in a low voice. \"Once a happy sovereign--now a poor, fleeing  woman, who can excite only pity. Oh, mother, mother, God be praised that  you do not behold my distress!\" She clasped her hands, and her trembling  lips whispered prayers to heaven. Her large blue eyes were raised with  an expression of fervent supplication, and tears rolled like pearls over  her cheeks. She sat a long while pondering over her misfortunes, and  shuddering at the prospects of the future.    Finally, Madame von Berg ventured to approach and arouse her from her  meditation.    \"Your majesty,\" she said, in an imploring voice, \"you promised to take  rest, for the sake of the king and of your children. Remember the burden  of care weighing down the heart of his majesty. Remember that his grief  would be more intense if he should see your eyes reddened with weeping,  and find you prostrated in your distress.\"    \"He shall not see it,\" said Louisa. \"In his presence I will conceal my  tears, and seem hopeful and courageous. Let me, therefore, now at least,  pour out my overwhelming sorrow, for tears are the only consolation of  the afflicted. When I am with my husband once more, I shall try to  smile, and only weep in secret. Are you now satisfied, my faithful  friend?\"    \"Your majesty had graciously promised me to take some refreshment, but  the footman has long since announced that dinner is ready.\"    \"Come, Caroline, we will eat,\" said the queen, rising hastily, and  laying her hand on her friend's shoulder.    She kept her word, and did eat a little, trying to become more cheerful  by conversing with Madame von Berg about her children and her  approaching reunion with her husband.    \"Believe me, Caroline,\" she then said gravely, \"it is not vanity and  longing for worldly splendor that causes me to bewail our present  trouble. For my part, I would gladly lead a private life, and be  contented in retirement and obscurity, if I could only see my husband  and my children happy at my side. But the king is not allowed to be as  other men are--merely a husband and father; he must think of his people,  of his state, and of his royal duties. He is not at liberty to lay down  his crown any more than we to destroy voluntarily the life we have  received from God. 'With"]]]
