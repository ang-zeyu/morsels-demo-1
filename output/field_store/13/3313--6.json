With the elementary understanding of fundamental symptoms of mental  diseases as a point of departure, let us consider the cases of Mohammed,  Jesus, and Moses, three of the most influential prophets in the history  of civilization.      MOHAMMED    Of the three, Mohammed should be considered before the others for  several reasons. First, there is no question regarding the actual  existence of Mohammed. We know that he was born at Mecca about 571 A.D.  and died at Medina on June 8th, 632 A.D. From the facts of his life and  the religion which he founded we are able to see the manner in which  legend and superstition were superimposed on its original simple form.  The historical records of his life and teachings are easier of access  since he is nearer our time than the other two prophets, and we can get  a better understanding of his character.    It was Gibbon who said, \"It may be expected that I should balance his  faults and his virtues, that I should decide whether the title of  enthusiast or impostor more properly belongs to that extraordinary  man.... At the distance of twelve centuries, I darkly contemplate his  shade through a cloud of incense.\"    In attempting to peer through this cloud of religious incense we find  the following facts: In the city of Mecca, probably in August, in the  year 571, Mohammed, the Prophet of Allah, was born. There seems little  doubt that he was descended from those lofty Koreish, whose opposition,  which at first nearly succeeded in holding his name in perpetual  oblivion, eventually caused him to emerge into the light of deathless  fame.    His birth was surrounded by all manner of signs and omens, we are told.  The labor of his mother, Amina, was entirely painless, earthquakes  loosed the bases of mountains and caused great bodies of water, whose  names were unfortunately not specified, to wither away or overflow; the  sacred fire of Zoroaster which, under the jealous care of the Magi, had  spouted ceaseless flames for nearly a thousand years, was extinguished.  All the idols in the world except the Kaaba tumbled to earth.  Immediately after the babe was born an ethereal light dazzled the  surrounding territory, and, on the very moment when his eyes were first  opened, he lifted them to heaven and exclaimed: \"God is great! There is  no God but Allah and I am his Prophet!\" All these poetic fancies have  been appropriately denounced by Christian scribes, who have claimed that  nature would never have dignified the birth of a pagan like Mohammed  with such marvelous prodigies as undoubtedly attended the advent of  Christ.    However, Mohammed was born shortly after the death of his father. At the  age of six his mother died also, and he spent the first ten years among  the Bedouins under the care of a foster-mother named Halima. At the age  of four it was noticed that the child had signs of convulsive seizures  which later commentators thought were of an epileptic nature. He was  brought up under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, and his early manhood  was spent in caring for the flock and in attending caravan expeditions.    When the prophet was twenty-five years old, his uncle secured for him a  position with a caravan owned by a wealthy widow, Khadija. Thanks to  Mohammed's keen business sense the caravan was highly successful, and he  was induced to personally report his success to Khadija. That lady, a  wealthy widow of forty years, and the mother of three children, was  highly pleased at Mohammed's story. As she listened to the proof of his  business ability and fondly scanned his large, nobly formed head, his  curling coal-black hair, his piercing eyes, and his comely form, it  naturally occurred to her that this vigorous and handsome young fellow  would make an excellent successor to her deceased husband. She had her  way and they were married. During the next fifteen years Mohammed led a  tranquil life. His future was provided for and he had plenty of leisure  to occupy himself as he chose. In these years Mohammed and his wife  continued to be conventional worshipers of idols, who nightly performed  rites in honor of various gods and goddesses, among whom were Allah and  his female consoler Al-Lat. And so, by the year 610, Mohammed, at the  age of forty, was nothing more than a respectable but unknown tradesman  who had experienced no extraordinary crises, whose few existing  utterances were dull and insipid, and whose life seemed destined to  remain as insignificant and unsung as any other Arab's.    At this time, he began to retire for days at a time to a cave in the  foothills of Mount Hira, a hill several miles north of Mecca. Meanwhile  his business languished. As the months passed, he still continued to act  in the same incomprehensible manner; it was noticed that little by  little certain members of his immediate family attended him to his  refuge or gathered with him in some one of their houses. This continued  for several years until it was rumored that Mohammed, the camel driver,  was confidently claiming the honor of having made a great discovery;  namely, that \"There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is His Prophet.\"    By what process of thought had Mohammed come to exalt Allah not merely  above all Arabian gods, but above the gods of all times? Furthermore,  why was he so certain of his own intimate association with Allah? We  can understand this if we consider Mohammed in the light of a victim of  mental disease.    One account informs us that as Mohammed was wandering near the cave at  Mount Hira, \"an angel from the sky cried to him, 'O Mohammed, I am  Gabriel!'\" He was terrified and hurried home to impart his experience to  his wife.    \"I see a light,\" he said to his wife, \"and I hear a sound. I fear that I  am possessed.\" This idea was most distressing to a pious man. He became  pale, haggard; he wandered about on the hill near Mecca crying for help  to God. More than once he drew near the edge of the cliff and was  tempted to hurl himself down, and so put an end to his misery at once.  He lived much in the open air, gazing on the stars, watching the dry  ground grow green beneath the gentle rain. He pondered also on the  religious legends of the Jews, which he had heard related on his  journeys; and as he looked and thought, the darkness was dispelled, the  clouds disappeared, and the vision of God in solitary grandeur rose  within his mind, and there came upon him an impulse to speak of God.  There came upon him a belief that he was a messenger of God sent on  earth to restore the religion of Abraham, which the pagan Arabs had  polluted with idolatry, the Jews in corrupting their holy books. At the  same time he heard a Voice, and sometimes he felt a noise in his ears  like the tinkling of bells or a low deep hum, as if bees were swarming  round his head.    At this period of his life the chapters of the Koran were delivered in  throes of pain. The paroxysms were preceded by depression of spirit, his  face became clouded, his extremities turned cold, he shook like a man in  an ague, and he called for coverings. His face assumed an expression  horrible to see, the vein between his eyebrows became distended, his  eyes were fixed, his head moved to and fro, as if he was conversing,  and then he gave forth the oracle or Sura.    The hitherto mentally and emotionally normal trader, husband, and father  was thus suddenly swept off his feet and carried irresistibly away on a  mighty tide. His perturbed spirit now soared to the heights of Heaven,  now plunged into the chasms of hell. Moments of ethereal bliss would be  followed by periods of profoundest melancholy.    \"It is related that the Angel Gabriel, who thus far had labored only in  the field of Christian endeavor, was chosen by Allah as bearer of the  divine revelation to Mohammed. One day, while the trader-poet was  wrestling with his doubts among the foothills of Mount Hira, he saw a  wondrous apparition floating downward on celestial wings. 'Thou art  God's Prophet, and I am Gabriel,' announced the awe-inspiring guest  before he departed to receive the blessing of Allah for having so  successfully executed the heavenly command. Gabriel was a very valuable  ambassador, for through the to-and-fro journeying of this indefatigable  messenger Allah was able to remain at ease in heaven, thus keeping up  the appearance of intangible, majestic remoteness so necessary for  dignified gods. And thus Mohammed came into his own. From that moment  Mohammed looked upon himself as Allah's vice regent, through whom  Allah's incontestable decrees were to be given to man.\" (_Mohammed_--_R.  F. Dibble._) Mohammed's every doubt had now vanished, his soul was  completely at ease, and from his lips there burst the wildly exultant  chant, \"There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is His Prophet.\"    The obliging Gabriel, he said, had borne him on a winged steed over  Medina to the Temple of Jerusalem, and from there he continued his  celestial journey until he was carried completely out of this world to  those ethereal realms of bliss where the Seven Heavens are. Up and up he  flew, while he carefully noted the order of precedence of those prophets  whose model he had proclaimed himself to be. Jesus and John were in the  second or third--he was not quite sure which--Moses was in the sixth,  while Abraham alone had the supreme distinction of residing in the  Seventh Heaven. There, at the apex of indescribable glory, Mohammed had  entered the awful presence of his Maker, Who, after some chit-chat,  charged him to see that all Moslems should hereafter prostrate  themselves in prayer toward the Temple of Solomon five times a day. The  truth of this narrative rests upon two solid facts: from that day to  this, all devout Moslems have continued to bow themselves five times  daily in prayer,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2028"],[0,"The Yellow Claw (#11)"],[1," \"and saw her footman gravely  take charge of the luggage which I had just brought from Victoria; and a  pal of mine followed the other--the Waterloo one, that was.\"    Inspector Dunbar scribbled busily. Then:--    \"You have done well to make a clean breast of it,\" he said. \"Take a  straight tip from me. Keep off the drink!\"          X    THE GREAT UNDERSTANDING      It was in the afternoon of this same day--a day so momentous in the  lives of more than one of London's millions--that two travelers might  have been seen to descend from a first-class compartment of the Dover  boat-train at Charing Cross.    They had been the sole occupants of the compartment, and, despite the  wide dissimilarity of character to be read upon their countenances,  seemed to have struck up an acquaintance based upon mutual amiability  and worldly common sense. The traveler first to descend and gallantly to  offer his hand to his companion in order to assist her to the platform,  was the one whom a casual observer would first have noted.    He was a man built largely, but on good lines; a man past his youth, and  somewhat too fleshy; but for all his bulk, there was nothing unwieldy,  and nothing ungraceful in his bearing or carriage. He wore a French  traveling-coat, conceived in a style violently Parisian, and composed of  a wonderful check calculated to have blinded any cutter in Savile Row.  From beneath its gorgeous folds protruded the extremities of severely  creased cashmere trousers, turned up over white spats which nestled  coyly about a pair of glossy black boots. The traveler's hat was of  velour, silver gray and boasting a partridge feather thrust in its  silken band. One glimpse of the outfit must have brought the entire  staff of the Tailor and Cutter to an untimely grave.    But if ever man was born who could carry such a make-up, this  traveler was he. The face was cut on massive lines, on fleshy lines,  clean-shaven, and inclined to pallor. The hirsute blue tinge about  the jaw and lips helped to accentuate the virile strength of the long,  flexible mouth, which could be humorous, which could be sorrowful, which  could be grim. In the dark eyes of the man lay a wealth of experience,  acquired in a lifelong pilgrimage among many peoples, and to many lands.  His dark brows were heavily marked, and his close-cut hair was splashed  with gray.    Let us glance at the lady who accepted his white-gloved hand, and who  sprang alertly onto the platform beside him.    She was a woman bordering on the forties, with a face of masculine  vigor, redeemed and effeminized, by splendid hazel eyes, the kindliest  imaginable. Obviously, the lady was one who had never married, who  despised, or affected to despise, members of the other sex, but who had  never learned to hate them; who had never grown soured, but who found  the world a garden of heedless children--of children who called for  mothering. Her athletic figure was clothed in a \"sensible\" tweed  traveling dress, and she wore a tweed hat pressed well on to her head,  and brown boots with the flattest heels conceivable. Add to this a  Scotch woolen muffler, and a pair of woolen gloves, and you have a  mental picture of the second traveler--a truly incongruous companion for  the first.    Joining the crowd pouring in the direction of the exit gates, the  two chatted together animatedly, both speaking English, and the man  employing that language with a perfect ease and command of words which  nevertheless failed to disguise his French nationality. He spoke with  an American accent; a phenomenon sometimes observable in one who has  learned his English in Paris.    The irritating formalities which beset the returning traveler--and the  lady distinctly was of the readily irritated type--were smoothed away by  the magic personality of her companion. Porters came at the beck of his  gloved hand; guards, catching his eye, saluted and were completely his  servants; ticket inspectors yielded to him the deference ordinarily  reserved for directors of the line.    Outside the station, then, her luggage having been stacked upon a cab,  the lady parted from her companion with assurances, which were returned,  that she should hope to improve the acquaintance.    The address to which the French gentleman politely requested the  cabman to drive, was that of a sound and old-established hotel in the  neighborhood of the Strand, and at no great distance from the station.    Then, having stood bareheaded until the cab turned out into the traffic  stream of that busy thoroughfare, the first traveler, whose baggage  consisted of a large suitcase, hailed a second cab and drove to the  Hotel Astoria--the usual objective of Americans.    Taking leave of him for the moment, let us follow the lady.    Her arrangements were very soon made at the hotel, and having removed  some of the travel-stains from her person and partaken of one cup of  China tea, respecting the quality whereof she delivered herself of some  caustic comments, she walked down into the Strand and mounted to the top  of a Victoria bound 'bus.    That she was not intimately acquainted with London, was a fact readily  observable by her fellow passengers; for as the 'bus went rolling  westward, from the large pocket of her Norfolk jacket she took out a  guide-book provided with numerous maps, and began composedly to consult  its complexities.    When the conductor came to collect her fare, she had made up her mind,  and was replacing the guidebook in her pocket.    \"Put me down by the Storis, Victoria Street, conductor,\" she directed,  and handed him a penny--the correct fare.    It chanced that at about the time, within a minute or so, of the  American lady's leaving the hotel, and just as red rays, the harbingers  of dusk, came creeping in at the latticed widow of her cozy work-room,  Helen Cumberly laid down her pen with a sigh. She stood up, mechanically  rearranging her hair as she did so, and crossed the corridor to her  bedroom, the window whereof overlooked the Square.    She peered down into the central garden. A common-looking man sat upon  a bench, apparently watching the labors of the gardener, which consisted  at the moment of the spiking of scraps of paper which disfigured the  green carpet of the lawn.    Helen returned to her writing-table and reseated herself. Kindly  twilight veiled her, and a chatty sparrow who perched upon the  window-ledge pretended that he had not noticed two tears which trembled,  quivering, upon the girl's lashes. Almost unconsciously, for it was an  established custom, she sprinkled crumbs from the tea-tray beside her  upon the ledge, whilst the tears dropped upon a written page and two  more appeared in turn upon her lashes.    The sparrow supped enthusiastically, being joined in his repast by two  talkative companions. As the last fragments dropped from the girl's  white fingers, she withdrew her hand, and slowly--very slowly--her head  sank down, pillowed upon her arms.    For some five minutes she cried silently; the sparrows, unheeded, bade  her good night, and flew to their nests in the trees of the Square.  Then, very resolutely, as if inspired by a settled purpose, she stood up  and recrossed the corridor to her bedroom.    She turned on the lamp above the dressing-table and rapidly removed the  traces of her tears, contemplating in dismay a redness of her pretty  nose which did not prove entirely amenable to treatment with the  powder-puff. Finally, however, she switched off the light, and, going  out on to the landing, descended to the door of Henry Leroux's flat.    In reply to her ring, the maid, Ferris, opened the door. She wore her  hat and coat, and beside her on the floor stood a tin trunk.    \"Why, Ferris!\" cried Helen--\"are you leaving?\"    \"I am indeed, miss!\" said the girl, independently.    \"But why? whatever will Mr. Leroux do?\"    \"He'll have to do the best he can. Cook's goin' too!\"    \"What! cook is going?\"    \"I am!\" announced a deep, female voice.    And the cook appeared beside the maid.    \"But whatever--\" began Helen; then, realizing that she could achieve  no good end by such an attitude: \"Tell Mr. Leroux,\" she instructed the  maid, quietly, \"that I wish to see him.\"    Ferris glanced rapidly at her companion, as a man appeared on the  landing, to inquire in an abysmal tone, if \"them boxes was ready to be  took?\" Helen Cumberly forestalled an insolent refusal which the cook, by  furtive wink, counseled to the housemaid.    \"Don't trouble,\" she said, with an easy dignity reminiscent of her  father. \"I will announce myself.\"    She passed the servants, crossed the lobby, and rapped upon the study  door.    \"Come in,\" said the voice of Henry Leroux.    Helen opened the door. The place was in semidarkness, objects being but  dimly discernible. Leroux sat in his usual seat at the writing-table.  The room was in the utmost disorder, evidently having received no  attention since its overhauling by the police. Helen pressed the switch,  lighting the two lamps.    Leroux, at last, seemed in his proper element: he exhibited an unhealthy  pallor, and it was obvious that no razor had touched his chin for at  least three days. His dark blue eyes the eyes of a dreamer--were heavy  and dull, with shadows pooled below them. A biscuit-jar, a decanter and  a syphon stood half buried in papers on the table.    \"Why, Mr. Leroux!\" said Helen, with a deep note of sympathy in her  voice--\"you don't mean to say\"...    Leroux rose, forcing a smile to his haggard face.    \"You see--much too good,\" he said. \"Altogether--too good.\"...    \"I thought I should find you here,\" continued the girl, firmly; \"but  I did not anticipate\"--she indicated the chaos about--\"this! The  insolence, the disgraceful, ungrateful insolence, of those women!\"    \"Dear, dear, dear!\" murmured Leroux, waving his hand vaguely; \"never  mind--never mind! They--er--they... I don't want them to stop... and,  believe me, I am--e"]]]
