In  1838, the adventurous Stephen threw a ladder across the chasm, and  passed over. There is now a narrow bridge of two planks, with a little  railing on each side; but as it is impossible to sustain it by piers,  travellers must pass over in the centre, one by one, and not touch the  railing, lest they disturb the balance, and overturn the bridge.    This walk brings you into Pensico Avenue. Hitherto, the path has been  rugged, wild, and rough, interrupted by steep acclivities, rocks, and  big stones; but this avenue has a smooth and level floor, as if the sand  had been spread out by gently flowing waters. Through this, descending  more and more, you come to a deep arch, by which you enter the Winding  Way; a strangely irregular and zig-zag path, so narrow that a very stout  man could not squeeze through. In some places, the rocks at the sides  are on a line with your shoulders, then piled high over your head; and  then again you rise above, and overlook them all, and see them heaped  behind you, like the mighty waves of the Red Sea, parted for the  Israelites to pass through. This toilsome path was evidently made by a  rushing, winding torrent. Toward the close, the water not having force  enough to make a smooth bed, has bored a tunnel. This is so low and  narrow, that the traveller is obliged to stoop and squeeze himself  through. Suddenly he passes into a vast hall, called the Great Relief;  and this leads into the River Hall, at the side of which you have a  glimpse of a small cave, called the Smoke House, because it is hung with  rocks perfectly in the shape of hams. The River Hall descends like the  slope of a mountain. The ceiling stretches away--away--before you, vast  and grand as the firmament at midnight. No one, who has never seen this  cave, can imagine the excitement, and awe, with which the traveller  keeps his eye fixed on the rocky ceiling, which, gradually revealed in  the passing light, continually exhibits some new and unexpected feature  of sublimity or beauty.    One of the most picturesque sights in the world, is to see a file of men  and women passing along these wild and craggy paths--slowly,  slowly--that their lamps may have time to illuminate the sky-like  ceiling, and gigantic walls; disappearing behind the high cliffs,  sinking into ravines, their lights shining upward through fissures in  the rocks; then suddenly emerging from some abrupt angle, standing in  the bright gleam of their lamps, relieved against the towering black  masses around them. He who could paint the infinite variety of creation,  can alone give an adequate description of this marvellous region. At one  side of River Hall is a steep precipice, over which you can look down,  by aid of blazing missiles, upon a broad, black sheet of water, eighty  feet below, called the Dead Sea. This is an awfully impressive place,  the sights and sounds of which do not easily pass from memory. He who  has seen it will have it vividly brought before him by Alfieri's  description of Filippo: \"Only a transient word or act gives us a short  and dubious glimmer, that reveals to us the abysses of his being; dark,  lurid, and terrific, as the throat of the infernal pool.\" As you pass  along, you hear the roar of invisible waterfalls, and at the foot of the  slope, the River Styx lies before you, deep and black, overarched with  rock. The first glimpse of it brings to mind the descent of Ulysses into  hell.        \"Where the dark rock o'erhangs the infernal lake,      And mingling screams eternal murmurs make.\"    Across these unearthly waters, the guide can convey but two passengers  at once; and these sit motionless in the canoe, with feet turned apart,  so as not to disturb the balance. Three lamps are fastened to the prow,  the images of which are reflected in the dismal pool.    If you are impatient of delay, or eager for new adventures, you can  leave your companions lingering about the shore, and cross the Styx by a  dangerous bridge of precipices overhead. In order to do this, you must  ascend a steep cliff and enter a cave above, from an egress of which you  find yourself on the bank of the river, eighty feet above its surface,  commanding a view of those passing in the boat, and those waiting on the  shore. Seen from this height, the lamps in the canoe glare like fiery  eyeballs; and the passengers sitting there, so hushed and motionless,  look like shadows. The scene is so strangely funereal and spectral, that  it seems as if the Greeks must have witnessed it, before they imagined  Charon conveying ghosts to the dim regions of Pluto. Your companions,  thus seen, do indeed--                  \"Skim along the dusky glades,      Thin airy shoals, and visionary shades.\"    [Illustration: THE RIVER STYX.]    If you turn your eye from the canoe, to the parties of men and women,  whom you left waiting on the shore, you will see them, by the gleam of  their lamps, scattered in picturesque groups, looming out in bold relief  from the dense darkness around them.    When you have passed the Styx, you soon meet another stream,  appropriately called Lethe. The echoes here are absolutely stunning. A  single voice sounds like a powerful choir; and could an organ be played,  it would deprive the hearer of his senses. When you have crossed, you  enter a high level hall, named the Great Walk, half a mile of which  brings you to another river, called the Jordan. In crossing this, the  rocks, in one place, descend so low, as to leave only eighteen inches  for the boat to pass through. Passengers are obliged to double up, and  lie on each other's shoulders till this gap is passed. This  uncomfortable position is, however, of short duration, and you suddenly  emerge to where the vault of the cave is more than a hundred feet high.  In the fall of the year, this river often rises, almost instantaneously,  over fifty feet above low-water mark; a phenomenon supposed to be caused  by heavy rains from the upper earth. On this account, autumn is an  unfavorable season for those who wish to explore the cave throughout. If  parties happen to be caught on the other side of Jordan, when the sudden  rise takes place, a boat conveys them, on the swollen waters, to the  level of an upper cave, so low that they are obliged to enter on hands  and knees, and crawl through. This place is called Purgatory. People on  the other side, aware of their danger, have a boat in readiness to  receive them. The guide usually sings while crossing the Jordan, and his  voice is reverberated by a choir of sweet echoes. The only animals ever  found in the cave are fish, with which this stream abounds. They are  perfectly white, and without eyes; at least, they have been subjected to  a careful scientific examination, and no organ similar to an eye can be  discovered. It would indeed be a useless appendage to creatures that  dwell for ever in Cimmerian darkness. But, as usual, the acuteness of  one sense is increased by the absence of another. These fish are  undisturbed by the most powerful glare of light, but they are alarmed at  the slightest agitation of the water; and it is therefore exceedingly  difficult to catch them.    The rivers of Mammoth Cave were never crossed till 1840. Great efforts  have been made to discover whence they come, and whither they go. But  though the courageous Stephen has floated for hours up to his chin, and  forced his way through the narrowest apertures under the dark waves, so  as to leave merely his head a breathing space, yet they still remain as  much a mystery as ever--without beginning or end, like eternity. They  disappear under arches, which, even at the lowest stage of the water,  are under the surface of it. From an unknown cause, it sometimes happens  in the neighborhood of these streams, that the figure of a distant  companion will apparently loom up, to the height of ten or twelve feet,  as he approaches you. This occasional phenomenon is somewhat frightful,  even to the most rational observer, occurring as it does in a region so  naturally associated with giants and genii.    From the Jordan, through Silliman's Avenue, you enter a high, narrow  defile, or pass, in a portion of which, called the Hanging Rocks, huge  masses of stone hang suspended over your head. At the side of this  defile, is a recess, called the Devil's Blacksmith's Shop. It contains a  rock shaped like an anvil, with a small inky current running near it,  and quantities of coarse stalagmite scattered about, precisely like  blacksmith's cinders, called slag. In another place, you pass a square  rock, covered with beautiful dog's tooth spar, called the Mile Stone.    This pass brings you into Wellington's Gallery, which tapers off to a  narrow point, apparently the end of the cave in this direction. But a  ladder is placed on one side by which you ascend to a small cleft in the  rock, through which you are at once ushered into a vast apartment,  discovered about two years ago. This is the commencement of Cleveland's  Avenue, the crowning wonder and glory of this subterranean world. At the  head of the ladder, you find yourself surrounded by overhanging  stalactites, in the form of rich clusters of grapes, transparent to the  light, hard as marble, and round and polished, as if done by a  sculptor's hand. This is called Mary's Vineyard; and from it, an  entrance to the right brings you into a perfectly naked cave, whence you  suddenly pass into a large hall, with magnificent columns, and rich  festoons of stalactite, in various forms of beautiful combination. In  the centre of this chamber, between columns of stalactite, stands a mass  of stalagmite, shaped like a sarcophagus, in which is an opening like a  grave. A Roman Catholic priest first discovered this, about a year ago,  and with fervent enthusiasm exclaimed, \"The Holy Sepulchre!\" a name  which it has since "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2096"],[0,"A Smaller History of Greece: from the Earliest Times to the Roman Conquest (#11)"],[1,"were very numerous, and extended  all along the coast of the AEgean, of the Hellespont, of the Propontis,  and of the Euxine, from the borders of Thessaly to the mouth of the  Danube.  Of these we can only glance at the most important.  The  colonies on the coast of Macedonia were chiefly founded by Chalcis and  Eretria in Euboea; and the peninsula of Chalcidice, with its three  projecting headlands, was covered with their settlements, and derived  its name from the former city. The Corinthians likewise planted a few  colonies on this coast, of which Potidaea, on the narrow isthmus of  Pallene, most deserves mention.    Of the colonies in Thrace, the most flourishing were Selymbria and  Byzantium, both founded by the Megarians, who appear as an enterprising  maritime people at an early period.        CHAPTER VII.    THE PERSIAN WARS.--FROM THE IONIC REVOLT TO THE BATTLE OF MARATHON,  B.C. 500-490.    The Grecian cities on the coast of Asia Minor were the neighbours of an  Asiatic power which finally reduced them to subjection. This was the  kingdom of Lydia, of which Sardis was the capital. Croesus, the last  and most powerful of the Lydian kings, who ascended the throne B.C.  560, conquered in succession all the Grecian cities on the coast.  His  rule, however, was not oppressive, and he permitted the cities to  regulate their own affairs.  He spoke the Greek language, welcomed  Greek guests, and reverenced the Greek oracles, which he enriched with  the most munificent offerings.  He extended his dominions in Asia Minor  as far as the river Halys, and he formed a close alliance with  Astyages, king of the Medes, who were then the ruling race in Asia.  Everything seemed to betoken uninterrupted prosperity, when a people  hitherto almost unknown suddenly became masters of the whole of western  Asia.    The Persians were of the same race as the Medes and spoke a dialect of  the same language.  They inhabited the mountainous region south of  Media, which slopes gradually down to the low grounds on the coast of  the Persian gulf.  While the Medes became enervated by the corrupting  influences to which they were exposed, the Persians preserved in their  native mountains their simple and warlike habits.  They were a brave  and hardy nation, clothed in skins, drinking only water, and ignorant  of the commonest luxuries of life.  Cyrus led these fierce warriors  from their mountain fastnesses, defeated the Medes in battle, took  Astyages prisoner, and deprived him of his throne.  The other nations  included in the Median empire submitted to the conqueror, and the  sovereignty of Upper Asia thus passed from the Medes to the Persians.  The accession of Cyrus to the empire is placed in B.C. 559.  A few  years afterwards Cyrus turned his arms against the Lydians, took  Sardis, and deprived Croesus of his throne (B.C. 546).  The fall of  Croesus was followed by the subjection of the Greek cities in Asia to  the Persian yoke.  They offered a brave but ineffectual resistance, and  were taken one after the other by Harpagus the Persian general.  Even  the islands of Lesbos and Chios sent in their submission to Harpagus,  although the Persians then possessed no fleet to force them to  obedience. Samos, on the other hand, maintained its independence, and  appears soon afterwards one of the most powerful of the Grecian states.    During the reign of Cambyses (B.C. 529-521), the son and successor of  Cyrus, the Greek cities of Asia remained obedient to their Persian  governors.  It was during this reign that Polycrates, tyrant of Samos,  became the master of the Grecian seas.  The ambition and good fortune  of this enterprising tyrant were alike remarkable.  He possessed a  hundred ships of war, with which he conquered several of the islands;  and he aspired to nothing less than the dominion of Ionia, as well as  of the islands in the AEgean.  The Lacedaemonians, who had invaded the  island at the invitation of the Samian exiles, for the purpose of  overthrowing his government, were obliged to retire, after besieging  his city in vain for forty days.  Everything which he undertook seemed  to prosper; but his uninterrupted good fortune at length excited the  alarm of his ally Amasis, the king of Egypt.  According to the tale  related by Herodotus, the Egyptian king, convinced that such amazing  good fortune would sooner or later incur the envy of the gods, wrote to  Polycrates, advising him to throw away one of his most valuable  possessions and thus inflict some injury upon himself.  Thinking the  advice to be good, Polycrates threw into the sea a favourite ring of  matchless price and beauty; but unfortunately it was found a few days  afterwards in the belly of a fine fish which a fisherman had sent him  as a present.  Amasis now foresaw that the ruin of Polycrates was  inevitable, and sent a herald to Samos to renounce his alliance.  The  gloomy anticipations of the Egyptian monarch proved well founded.  In  the midst of all his prosperity Polycrates fell by a most ignominious  fate.  Oroetes, the satrap of Sardis, had for some unknown cause  conceived a deadly hatred against the Samian despot.  By a cunning  stratagem the satrap allured him to the mainland, where he was  immediately arrested and hanged upon a cross (B.C. 522).    The reign of Darius, the third king of Persia.  (B.C. 521-485), is  memorable in Grecian history.  In his invasion of Scythia, his fleet,  which was furnished by the Asiatic Greeks, was ordered to sail up the  Danube and throw a bridge of boats across the river. The King himself,  with his land forces, marched through Thrace; and, crossing the bridge,  placed it under the care of the Greeks, telling them that, if he did  not return within sixty days, they might break it down, and sail home.  He then left them, and penetrated into the Scythian territory.  The  sixty days had already passed away, and there was yet no sign of the  Persian army; but shortly afterwards the Greeks were astonished by the  appearance of a body of Scythians, who informed them that Darius was in  full retreat, pursued by the whole Scythian nation, and that his only  hope of safety depended upon that bridge.  They urged the Greeks to  seize this opportunity of destroying the Persian army, and of  recovering their own liberty, by breaking down the bridge.  Their  exhortations were warmly seconded by the Athenian Miltiades, the tyrant  of the Thracian Chersonesus, and the future conqueror of Marathon.  The  other rulers of the Ionian cities were at first disposed to follow his  suggestion; but as soon as Histiaeus of Miletus reminded them that  their sovereignty depended upon the support of the Persian king, and  that his ruin would involve their own, they changed their minds and  resolved to await the Persians.  After enduring great privations and  sufferings Darius and his army at length reached the Danube and crossed  the bridge in safety.  Thus the selfishness of these Grecian despots  threw away the most favourable opportunity that ever presented itself  of delivering their native cities from the Persian yoke.  To reward the  services of Histiaeus, Darius gave him the town of Myrainus, near the  Strymon.  Darius, on his return to Asia, left Megabazus in Europe with  an army of 80,000 men to complete the subjugation of Thrace and of the  Greek cities upon the Hellespont.  Megabazus not only subdued the  Thracians, but crossed the Strymon, conquered the Paeonians, and  penetrated as far as the frontiers of Macedonia.  He then sent heralds  into the latter country to demand earth and water, the customary  symbols of submission.  These were immediately granted by Amyntas, the  reigning monarch (B.C. 510); and thus the Persian dominions were  extended to the borders of Thessaly.  Megabazus, on his return to  Sardis, where Darius awaited him, informed the Persian monarch that  Histiaeus was collecting the elements of a power which might hereafter  prove formidable to the Persian sovereignty, since Myrcinus commanded  the navigation of the Strymon, and consequently the commerce with the  interior of Thrace.  Darius, perceiving that the apprehensions of his  general were not without foundation, summoned Histiaeus to his  presence, and, under the pretext that he could not bear to be deprived  of the company of his friend, carried him with the rest of the court to  Susa.  This apparently trivial circumstance was attended with important  consequences to the Persian empire and to the whole Grecian race.    For the next few years everything remained quiet in the Greek cities of  Asia; but about B.C. 502 a revolution in Naxos, one of the islands in  the AEgean Sea, first disturbed the general repose, and occasioned the  war between Greece and Asia.  The aristocratical exiles, who had been  driven out of Naxos by a rising of the people, applied for aid to  Aristagoras, the tyrant of Miletus and the son-in-law of Histiaeus.  Aristagoras readily promised his assistance, knowing that, if they were  restored by his means, he should become master of the island.  He  obtained the co-operation of Artaphernes, the satrap of western Asia by  holding out to him the prospect of annexing not only Naxos, but all the  islands of the AEgean sea, to the Persian empire.  He offered at the  same time to defray the expense of the armament. Artaphernes placed at  his disposal a fleet of 200 ships under the command of Megabates, a  Persian of high rank; but Aristagoras having affronted the Persian  admiral, the latter revenged himself by privately informing the Naxians  of the object of the expedition, which had hitherto been kept a secret.  When the Persian fleet reached Naxos they experienced a vigorous  resistance; and at the end of four months they were compelled to  abandon the enterprise and return to Miletus.  Aristagoras was now  threatened with utter ruin.  Having deceived Artaphernes, and incurred  the enmity of Megabates, he could expect no"]]]
