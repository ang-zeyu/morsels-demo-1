He regrets the delay in replying to them, but he has been, and still is,  engaged on a work which requires a tremendous amount of his time, and his  correspondence has, of necessity, suffered from it.    The Guardian would prefer sending all cables and moneys etc., to you  direct, but the war regulations, as enforced in this country, prohibit the  use of a postal address in cables or telegrams, and as he does not have  your street address, he has had to do it this way. Please forward your own  address, or the one you care to have used, and it will simplify matters in  the future.    He is delighted to hear that the friends will be able to hold a Convention  in April, and he hopes that, through its deliberations, and the meetings  of the N.S.A. members, far reaching teaching plans will be set afoot and  the Cause in New Zealand and Australia obtain a new impetus. You already  have the nuclei of a number of Spiritual Assemblies in places where there  are a group of believers, and he hopes that through following the methods,  so successful in such countries as India and the United States, of having  both travelling teachers and pioneers or settlers go out you will have a  number of new Spiritual Assemblies by 1944.    He was very pleased to see the increased interest among the friends in  their various Baha'i Summer and Winter Schools, and hopes that these will  increasingly attract students of the Faith, anxious to deepen their  knowledge of its wonderful teachings.    The Australian and New Zealand friends, now feeling the full weight of the  war, its dangers and sorrows, are very often in his prayers. He feels  confident that they will emerge from these dark years stronger in spirit,  more united and consecrated than ever before. They have a great and  precious mission before them of rearing, albeit in miniature the pattern  of a New World Order, divine in origin, in the midst of their countrymen,  who someday are sure to turn to that pattern as the solution to their  problems and the harbinger of their happiness.    He assures you and all the members of the N.S.A. of his continued, loving  prayers, that you may be guided and aided in all your services to our  beloved Faith.    With Baha'i love,  R. Rabbani.    P.S. The Guardian replied to Mr. Heggie's letter, and he is very pleased  to hear of the fine work he is doing. He is also pleased to hear that the  work will now go on in connection with Father Dunn's Memorial.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The constancy, the zeal, the unity and devotion which characterize the  activities of the dearly-beloved community of Australia and New Zealand  Baha'is evoke my heartfelt admiration, and demonstrate the power of  Baha'u'llah and His unfailing guidance. I will pray for them all, will  supplicate for them His richest blessings, and feel confident that if they  persevere in their noble task their mission will be crowned with glorious  success.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF MARCH 14TH, 1944      Haifa, March 14th, 1944    Dear Baha'i Sister:    Your letters dated June 8th, Sep. 12th, Nov. 12th, Jan. 10th and 17th,  1944, together with their enclosures, have all been received, and the  Guardian has instructed me to answer them on his behalf. He has also  received the envelope of photographs you sent of N.S.A. Members, Father  Dunn's grave and other pictures of Baha'i friends, for which he thanks  you.    He also wishes to thank you for your manuscript for the Baha'i World which  was also received safely.    In regard to the recently purchased National Headquaters in Sydney: He was  delighted that you were able to take possession of a house suitable to the  present requirements of the Faith, and he trusts that by the time this  reaches you all the legal steps will have been completed and the building  registered in the name of the National Spiritual Assembly. It should be  called by its proper title of \"Haziratu'l-Quds\".    The ideal to be followed, of course, is for the Secretariat, the office of  the treasurer, etc., to be in the National Headquarters. However, this can  be brought about gradually, and he leaves decisions in this matter to the  N.S.A.    He trusts that the combined Centenary Celebrations and annual Convention  will not only draw a large group of believers to Sydney to meet in their  new Haziratu'l-Quds, but will also be a means of attracting the attention  of the public to the Faith on a wider scale than ever before. The  Australian and New Zealand friends are standing not only on the threshold  of the second Baha'i Century but also on the threshold of a new phase of  the Cause in that part of the world. Their responsibilities are therefore  greatly increased, and he believes they will meet them unitedly, with  clear vision, and their characteristic devotion to our beloved Faith.    He assures you and the other members of the N.S.A. of his loving prayers  for the success of your labours and the fulfilment of your dearest hopes.    With Baha'i love,  R. Rabbani.    P.S. He found the newspaper clippings you forwarded of great interest, and  is pleased to see that the press is being so friendly and helpful. He has  already through a cable stated that the convention should be held in  conjunction with the Centenary Celebrations which embrace the 23rd of May.  The Commemoration gathering should be held on the 22nd of May exactly at  two hours and eleven minutes after sunset, which is the time at which the  Bab declared His Mission.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The activities of the beloved friends in Australia and New Zealand during  recent troubles have been truly remarkable. Now that the Haziratu'l-Quds  is to be established in Sydney I trust and pray that this central  administrative headquarters in the oldest and leading Baha'i centre in  that far-off continent will act as a powerful magnet and attract the  manifold blessings of the Almighty and lend a tremendous impetus to the  organized activities of the believers in Australia and New Zealand. I will  continue to pray for them from the depths of my heart.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF OCT. 17TH, 1944      Haifa, Oct. 17th, 1944.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    The Guardian has instructed me to acknowledge your letter dated June 27th  and also two previous ones from the former secretary of the N.S.A. dated  Feb. 6th and Aug. 27th, and to answer them on his behalf.    He deeply appreciates all the work done by dear Miss Brooks in the past as  Secretary of the National Assembly, and hopes that now that she is  relieved of this arduous post she will devote much of her time to teaching  and writing for the Faith.    The sacrifice you and your husband are making by moving to Sydney in order  to attend to the work of the N.S.A. is truly praiseworthy, and he hopes  the way will open for you to do so at an early date.    In connection with the incorporation of the N.S.A.: the Guardian feels  that whatever form the incorporation takes the name and seal of the Nat.  assembly must not be changed in any way, i.e. the title \"National  Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia and New Zealand\" should be  preserved.    The various enclosures you forwarded in your letter were all received  safely by him.    He hopes that now that the National Headquarters has been established and  you are going to take up residence there as Secretary--thus giving a new  permanence and prestige to the functions of the N.S.A.--the work of the  Faith will go ahead by leaps and bounds. The many groups now functioning  should be aided and strengthened with a view to forming new Spiritual  Assemblies as soon as possible, and the Cause should be given publicity as  much as possible, through the Press, Radio and public meetings.    You may be sure his most loving prayers will be offered for the success of  your labours as N.S.A. secretary, and for your health and guidance. Also  for the confirmation of your dear husband in the Faith.    With Baha'i love,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The work accomplished by the Australian and New Zealand believers in  recent years, in both the teaching and administrative spheres of Baha'i  activity, culminating in the splendid celebrations at the newly  established national headquarters in the capital city of the Australian  Commonwealth, is highly praiseworthy and augurs well for the future. The  opening years of the new century must witness a stupendous effort on the  part of the newly established community in the teaching field--an effort at  once nation-wide, systematic, strenuous and persistent. The multiplication  of Baha'i centres in towns and villages, a greater measure of publicity, a  higher degree of unity and consecration to the Faith, a fuller measure of  self-sacrifice should distinguish the labours of the members of this  community. I will pray from the depths of my heart for the removal of  every obstacle from your path and the speedy realization of every hope you  cherish for the promotion of His Faith and the consolidation of its  institutions.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF DEC. 12TH, 1944      Haifa, Dec. 12th, 1944.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write your National Spiritual  Assembly and inform you of his views and wishes in connection with the  Summer School in Australia:    He does not consider it either wise or necessary at the present time to  have more than one Baha'i Summer School in Australia, and as Yerrinbool is  equipped to accommodate the friends on Baha'i property, so to speak, he  would suggest that Yerrinbool continue to be used as the Australian Baha'i  Summer School.    He pointed out this same principle of not multiplying the number "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19275"],[0,"God Passes By (#11)"],[1,"advocated by the impetuous  Tahirih. The primary purpose of that gathering was to implement the  revelation of the Bayan by a sudden, a complete and dramatic break with  the past--with its order, its ecclesiasticism, its traditions, and  ceremonials. The subsidiary purpose of the conference was to consider the  means of emancipating the Bab from His cruel confinement in _Ch_ihriq. The  first was eminently successful; the second was destined from the outset to  fail.    The scene of such a challenging and far-reaching proclamation was the  hamlet of Bada_sh_t, where Baha'u'llah had rented, amidst pleasant  surroundings, three gardens, one of which He assigned to Quddus, another  to Tahirih, whilst the third He reserved for Himself. The eighty-one  disciples who had gathered from various provinces were His guests from the  day of their arrival to the day they dispersed. On each of the twenty-two  days of His sojourn in that hamlet He revealed a Tablet, which was chanted  in the presence of the assembled believers. On every believer He conferred  a new name, without, however, disclosing the identity of the one who had  bestowed it. He Himself was henceforth designated by the name Baha. Upon  the Last Letter of the Living was conferred the appellation of Quddus,  while Qurratu'l-'Ayn was given the title of Tahirih. By these names they  were all subsequently addressed by the Bab in the Tablets He revealed for  each one of them.    It was Baha'u'llah Who steadily, unerringly, yet unsuspectedly, steered  the course of that memorable episode, and it was Baha'u'llah Who brought  the meeting to its final and dramatic climax. One day in His presence,  when illness had confined Him to bed, Tahirih, regarded as the fair and  spotless emblem of chastity and the incarnation of the holy Fatimih,  appeared suddenly, adorned yet unveiled, before the assembled companions,  seated herself on the right-hand of the affrighted and infuriated Quddus,  and, tearing through her fiery words the veils guarding the sanctity of  the ordinances of Islam, sounded the clarion-call, and proclaimed the  inauguration, of a new Dispensation. The effect was electric and  instantaneous. She, of such stainless purity, so reverenced that even to  gaze at her shadow was deemed an improper act, appeared for a moment, in  the eyes of her scandalized beholders, to have defamed herself, shamed the  Faith she had espoused, and sullied the immortal Countenance she  symbolized. Fear, anger, bewilderment, swept their inmost souls, and  stunned their faculties. 'Abdu'l-_Kh_aliq-i-Isfahani, aghast and deranged  at such a sight, cut his throat with his own hands. Spattered with blood,  and frantic with excitement, he fled away from her face. A few, abandoning  their companions, renounced their Faith. Others stood mute and transfixed  before her. Still others must have recalled with throbbing hearts the  Islamic tradition foreshadowing the appearance of Fatimih herself unveiled  while crossing the Bridge (Sirat) on the promised Day of Judgment. Quddus,  mute with rage, seemed to be only waiting for the moment when he could  strike her down with the sword he happened to be then holding in his hand.    Undeterred, unruffled, exultant with joy, Tahirih arose, and, without the  least premeditation and in a language strikingly resembling that of the  Qur'an, delivered a fervid and eloquent appeal to the remnant of the  assembly, ending it with this bold assertion: \"I am the Word which the  Qa'im is to utter, the Word which shall put to flight the chiefs and  nobles of the earth!\" Thereupon, she invited them to embrace each other  and celebrate so great an occasion.    On that memorable day the \"Bugle\" mentioned in the Qur'an was sounded, the  \"stunning trumpet-blast\" was loudly raised, and the \"Catastrophe\" came to  pass. The days immediately following so startling a departure from the  time-honored traditions of Islam witnessed a veritable revolution in the  outlook, habits, ceremonials and manner of worship of these hitherto  zealous and devout upholders of the Muhammadan Law. Agitated as had been  the Conference from first to last, deplorable as was the secession of the  few who refused to countenance the annulment of the fundamental statutes  of the Islamic Faith, its purpose had been fully and gloriously  accomplished. Only four years earlier the Author of the Babi Revelation  had declared His mission to Mulla Husayn in the privacy of His home in  _Sh_iraz. Three years after that Declaration, within the walls of the  prison-fortress of Mah-Ku, He was dictating to His amanuensis the  fundamental and distinguishing precepts of His Dispensation. A year later,  His followers, under the actual leadership of Baha'u'llah, their  fellow-disciple, were themselves, in the hamlet of Bada_sh_t, abrogating  the Qur'anic Law, repudiating both the divinely-ordained and man-made  precepts of the Faith of Muhammad, and shaking off the shackles of its  antiquated system. Almost immediately after, the Bab Himself, still a  prisoner, was vindicating the acts of His disciples by asserting, formally  and unreservedly, His claim to be the promised Qa'im, in the presence of  the Heir to the Throne, the leading exponents of the _Sh_ay_kh_i  community, and the most illustrious ecclesiastical dignitaries assembled  in the capital of A_dh_irbayjan.    A little over four years had elapsed since the birth of the Bab's  Revelation when the trumpet-blast announcing the formal extinction of the  old, and the inauguration of the new Dispensation was sounded. No pomp, no  pageantry marked so great a turning-point in the world's religious  history. Nor was its modest setting commensurate with such a sudden,  startling, complete emancipation from the dark and embattled forces of  fanaticism, of priestcraft, of religious orthodoxy and superstition. The  assembled host consisted of no more than a single woman and a handful of  men, mostly recruited from the very ranks they were attacking, and devoid,  with few exceptions, of wealth, prestige and power. The Captain of the  host was Himself an absentee, a captive in the grip of His foes. The arena  was a tiny hamlet in the plain of Bada_sh_t on the border of Mazindaran.  The trumpeter was a lone woman, the noblest of her sex in that  Dispensation, whom even some of her co-religionists pronounced a heretic.  The call she sounded was the death-knell of the twelve hundred year old  law of Islam.    Accelerated, twenty years later, by another trumpet-blast, announcing the  formulation of the laws of yet another Dispensation, this process of  disintegration, associated with the declining fortunes of a superannuated,  though divinely revealed Law, gathered further momentum, precipitated, in  a later age, the annulment of the _Sh_ari'ah canonical Law in Turkey, led  to the virtual abandonment of that Law in _Sh_i'ah Persia, has, more  recently, been responsible for the dissociation of the System envisaged in  the Kitab-i-Aqdas from the Sunni ecclesiastical Law in Egypt, has paved  the way for the recognition of that System in the Holy Land itself, and is  destined to culminate in the secularization of the Muslim states, and in  the universal recognition of the Law of Baha'u'llah by all the nations,  and its enthronement in the hearts of all the peoples, of the Muslim  world.          Chapter III: Upheavals in Mazindaran, Nayriz and Zanjan      The Bab's captivity in a remote corner of A_dh_irbayjan, immortalized by  the proceedings of the Conference of Bada_sh_t, and distinguished by such  notable developments as the public declaration of His mission, the  formulation of the laws of His Dispensation and the establishment of His  Covenant, was to acquire added significance through the dire convulsions  that sprang from the acts of both His adversaries and His disciples. The  commotions that ensued, as the years of that captivity drew to a close,  and that culminated in His own martyrdom, called forth a degree of heroism  on the part of His followers and a fierceness of hostility on the part of  His enemies which had never been witnessed during the first three years of  His ministry. Indeed, this brief but most turbulent period may be rightly  regarded as the bloodiest and most dramatic of the Heroic Age of the  Baha'i Era.    The momentous happenings associated with the Bab's incarceration in Mah-Ku  and _Ch_ihriq, constituting as they did the high watermark of His  Revelation, could have no other consequence than to fan to fiercer flame  both the fervor of His lovers and the fury of His enemies. A persecution,  grimmer, more odious, and more shrewdly calculated than any which Husayn  _Kh_an, or even Haji Mirza Aqasi, had kindled was soon to be unchained, to  be accompanied by a corresponding manifestation of heroism unmatched by  any of the earliest outbursts of enthusiasm that had greeted the birth of  the Faith in either _Sh_iraz or Isfahan. This period of ceaseless and  unprecedented commotion was to rob that Faith, in quick succession, of its  chief protagonists, was to attain its climax in the extinction of the life  of its Author, and was to be followed by a further and this time an almost  complete elimination of its eminent supporters, with the sole exception of  One Who, at its darkest hour, was entrusted, through the dispensations of  Providence, with the dual function of saving a sorely-stricken Faith from  annihilation, and of ushering in the Dispensation destined to supersede  it.    The formal assumption by the Bab of the authority of the promised Qa'im,  in such dramatic circumstances and in so challenging a tone, before a  distinguished gathering of eminent _Sh_i'ah ecclesiastics, powerful,  jealous, alarmed and hostile, was the explosive force that loosed a  veritable avalanche of calamities which swept down upon the Faith and the  people among whom it was born. It raised to fervid heat the zeal that  glowed in the souls of the Bab's"]]]
