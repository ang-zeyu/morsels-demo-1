I will keep on making believe that I would  rather do this than anything else.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The big sister of the Brown Pigs looked over to the White Pig and said,  \"She's having lots of fun all by herself, it seems to me.\"    Big brother raised his head. \"Let's call her over here,\" he answered.    \"Oh, do!\" cried the twelve little Pigs, wriggling their tails. \"She  looks so full of fun.\"    \"Call her yourself,\" said the big sister to the big brother.    \"Ugh!\" called he. \"Ugh! Ugh! Don't you want to come over with us, White  Pig?\"    You can imagine how the White Pig felt when she heard this; how her  small eyes twinkled and the corners of her mouth turned up more than  ever. She was just about to scamper over and root with them, when she  remembered something else that her mother had told her: \"Never run after  other Pigs. Let them run after you. Then they will think more of you.\"    She called back, \"I'm having too good a time here to leave my  rooting-ground. Won't you come over here?\"    \"Come on,\" cried all the little Pigs to each other. \"Beat you there!\"    They ate and talked and slept together all afternoon, and when the Brown  Hog called her children home, they and the White Pig were the best of  friends. \"Just think,\" they said to their mother, \"the White Pig let us  visit her, and she is just as nice as she can be.\"    The White Pig in her corner of the pen heard this and smiled to herself.  \"My mother was right,\" she said; \"'Have a good time alone, and everybody  will want to come.'\"          THE KITTEN WHO LOST HERSELF      \"I think,\" said the Blind Horse, \"that something is the matter with my  ears.\" He and the Dappled Gray had been doing field-work all the  morning, and were now eating a hearty dinner in their stalls. They were  the only people on the first floor of the barn. Even the stray Doves who  had wandered in the open door were out in the sunshine once more. Once  in a while the whirr of wings told that some Swallow darted through the  window into the loft above and flew to her nest under the roof. There  was a deep and restful quiet in the sun-warmed air, and yet the Blind  Horse had seemed to be listening to something which the other did not  hear.    The Dappled Gray stopped eating at once. \"Your ears?\" said he. \"What is  wrong with them? I thought your hearing was very good.\"    \"It always has been,\" was the answer, \"and finer than ever since I lost  my sight. You know it is always so with us blind people. We learn to  hear better than we could before losing our sight. But ever since we  came in from the field I have had a queer sound in my ears, and I think  there is something the matter with them.\"    The Dappled Gray stopped eating and stood perfectly still to listen. He  did not even switch his tail, although at that minute there were three  Flies on his left side and one on his neck. He was trying as hard as he  could to hear the queer sound also, for if he did, it would prove that  the noise was real and that the Blind Horse's hearing was all right.    He could not hear a thing. \"What is it like?\" he asked.    \"Like the loud purring of a Cat,\" was the answer, \"but everybody knows  that the Cat is not purring anywhere around here.\"    \"She might be,\" said the Dappled Gray. \"Where does the sound seem to  be?\"    \"Above my head,\" said the Blind Horse; \"and she certainly would not be  purring up there at this time. She would either be sound asleep, or off  hunting, or else out in the sunshine, where she loves to sit.\"    The Dappled Gray felt that this was so, and he could not say a word. He  was very sorry for his friend. He thought how dreadful it would seem to  be both blind and deaf, and he choked on the oats he was swallowing.    \"Now don't worry,\" said the Blind Horse; \"if I should be deaf, I could  still feel the soft touch of the breeze on my skin, and could taste my  good food, and rub noses with my friends. I wouldn't have spoken of it,  only I hoped that you could hear the noise also, and then I would know  that it was real.\" That was just like him. He was always patient and  sweet-tempered. In all the years he had been blind, he had never once  complained of it, and many times when the other Horses were about to say  or do some ill-natured thing, they thought of him and stopped. They were  ashamed to be impatient when they were so much better off than he.    The Horses kept on eating their oats and resting from their hard work.  In the hay-loft above their heads, the Cat lay and purred and purred and  purred, never dreaming that her doing so made trouble for her friends  downstairs.    She had been hunting all the night before, creeping softly through the  barn and hiding behind bags and boxes to watch for careless Mice and  young Rats. They were night-runners as well as she, and many things  happened in the barn and farmyard while the larger four-legged people  were sound asleep and the fowls were dreaming with their heads tucked  under their wings. Sometimes there were not so many Mice in the morning  as there had been the evening before, and when this was so, the Cat  would walk slowly through the barn and look for a comfortable  resting-place. When she found it, she would turn around three times, as  her great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother used to do to  trample a bed in the jungle, and then lie down for a long nap. She said  she always slept better when her stomach was full, and that was the  habit of all Cats.    Sometimes she hunted in the fields, and many a morning at sunrise the  Cows had seen her walking toward the barn on the top of the fences. She  did not like to wet her feet on the dewy grass when it could be helped;  so, as soon as she was through hunting, she jumped on to the nearest  fence and went home in that way.    Yes, last night she had been hunting, yet she was not thinking of it  now. Neither was she asleep. A Rat gnawed at the boards near her, and  she hardly turned her head. A Mouse ran across the floor in plain sight,  and she watched him without moving. What did she care about them now?  Her first Kittens lay on the hay beside her, and she would not leave  them on this first day of their lives unless she really had to.    Of course she had seen little Kittens before--Kittens that belonged to  other Cats--but she was certain that none of them had looked at all like  her three charming babies. She could not decide which one of them was  the most beautiful. She was a Tortoise-shell Cat herself, and her fur  was spotted with white, black, and yellow. The babies had the same  colors on their soft coats, but not in just the same way as hers.    At first she thought her largest daughter was the beauty of the family;  she was such a clear yellow, with not a hair of any other color on her.  \"I always did like yellow Cats,\" said the young mother, \"and they are  said to be very strong.\"    Then she looked at her smaller daughter, who was white with tiny yellow  and black spots on neck and head. \"Such a clean-looking baby,\" she  exclaimed, \"and I am sure that when her eyes are open I shall find them  blue like my own.\"    Just at this moment, the warm, dark little bunch of fur between her  forepaws moved, and she looked lovingly down upon him, her only son. \"He  is certainly a very remarkable one,\" she said. \"I never before saw such  a fine mixture of yellow and black, first a hair of one and then a hair  of the other, so that, unless one is very close to him it looks like a  rich brown. And then his feet!\" She gave him a loving little poke with  one forefoot and turned him onto his back. This made him wave his tiny  paws in the air. The thick cushions of skin on each were as black as  black could be, and that is very uncommon. They are usually pink, like  those of his sisters.    The little fellow lay there, wriggling very feebly, until his mother  gave him another poke that turned him over. Then he stretched and  crawled toward her, reaching his head first one way and then another. He  was so weak that he could not raise his body from the hay, but dragged  it along by taking short and uncertain steps with his four shaking legs.  It was only a short time since he found that he had legs, and he hadn't  any idea how to use them. He just moved whichever one seemed most in his  way.    He didn't know where he was going, or what he was going for, but his  little stomach was empty and he was cold. Something, he didn't know  what, made him drag himself toward the big, warm creature near by. When  his black nose touched the fur of her body, he stopped pushing ahead and  began to feel from side to side. He did not know now for what he was  feeling, yet when he found something his tiny mouth closed around it and  a stream of sweet warm milk began to flow down his throat and into his  empty stomach. He did not know that it was milk. He did not know  anything except that it was good, and then he fell asleep. His sisters  did in the same way, and soon the happy mother could look down and see  her three babies in a row beside her, all sound asleep. Their pointed  little tails lay straight out behind them, and their soft ears were bent  forward close to their heads.    \"I wonder,\" said she, \"if I was ever as small as they are, and if my  mother loved me as I love them.\" She stretched out one of her forepaws  and looked at it. It was so much larger, so very much larger, than the  paws of the Kittens. Such a soft and dainty paw as it was, and so  perfectly clean. She stretched it even more, and saw five long, curved,  sharp claws slide out of their sheaths or cases. She quickly slid them  back into their sheaths, for fear that in some way they might happen to  touch and hurt her babies.    A Swallow flew down from his nest and passed over "]]]
