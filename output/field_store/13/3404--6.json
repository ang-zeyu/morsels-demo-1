The elder one wore carpet slippers to which he had attached--I do not  know how--an enormous pair of golden spurs! He was now returning from  Russia. He was extremely gentleman-like and seemed very much annoyed at  the behaviour of his companion. He begged me to believe that not all men  in Persia were like his friend, and I quite agreed with him.    We travelled a great portion of the road together, and the old fellow was  extremely civil. He was very well informed on nearly all subjects, and  had belonged to the army. He pointed out to me the important sights on  the road, such as Mount Janja (7,489 ft.) to the East.    After passing Rudbar (665 ft.) the road is mostly in narrow gorges  between mountains. It is rocky and arid, with hardly any vegetation. The  river has to be crossed by the new bridge, a handsome and solid  structure, and we arrive at the village of Menjil or Menzil. The Russian  station-house is the most prominent structure. Otherwise all is desert  and barren. Grey and warm reddish tints abound in the dried-up landscape,  and only a few stunted olive groves relieve the scenery with some  vegetable life.          CHAPTER VII         Menzil and the winds--The historical Alamut mountain--A low       plateau--Volcanic formation--Mol-Ali--A genuine case of       smallpox--Characteristic sitting posture--A caravan of       mules--Rugged country--The remains of a volcanic commotion--The       old track--Kasvin, the city of misfortunes--The Governor's palace       and palatial rest house--Earthquakes and famine--_Kanats_, the       marvellous aqueducts--How they are made--Manufactures--Kasvin       strategically.      Perhaps Menzil should be mentioned in connection with the terrific winds  which, coming from the north-east and from the south, seem to meet here,  and blow with all their might at all times of the year. The traveller is  particularly exposed to them directly above the river course on crossing  the bridge. Menzil is celebrated for these winds, which are supposed to  be the worst, in all Persia, but unpleasant as they may be to any one who  has not experienced worse, they are merely gentle breezes as compared,  for instance, with the wind storms of the Tibetan plateau. To the east  there is a very mountainous region, the Biwarzin Yarak range, or  Kuse-rud, averaging from 6,000 to 7,000 ft.; further north a peak of  7,850 ft., and south-west of the Janja, 7,489 ft., the high Salambar,  11,290 ft. On the historical Mt. Alamut the old state prisons were  formerly to be found, but were afterwards removed to Ardebil.    From Menzil we have left the Sefid River altogether, and we are now in a  very mountainous region, with a singular low plateau in the centre of an  extensive alluvial plain traversed by the road. We cross the Shah Rud, or  River of the King, and at Paichinar, with its Russian post-house, we have  already reached an altitude of 1,800 ft. From this spot the road proceeds  through a narrow valley, through country rugged and much broken up,  distinctly volcanic and quite picturesque. It is believed that coal is to  be found here.    Perhaps one of the prettiest places we had yet come to was Mol-Ali, a  lovely shady spot with veteran green trees all round. While the horses  were being changed I was asked by the khafe-khana man to go and inspect a  man who was ill. The poor fellow was wrapped up in many blankets and  seemed to be suffering greatly. He had very high fever and his was a  genuine case of smallpox. Next to him, quite unconcerned, were a number  of Persian travellers, who had halted here for refreshments. They were  squatting on their heels, knees wide apart, and arms balanced, resting  above the elbow on their knees--the characteristic sitting posture of all  Asiatics. Very comfortable it is, too, when you learn to balance yourself  properly and it leaves the free use of one's arms. The _kalian_ was being  passed round as usual, and each had a thimble-full of sugared tea.    I was much attracted by a large caravan of handsome mules, the animals  enjoying the refreshing shade of the trees. They had huge saddles  ornamented with silver pommels and rings and covered over with carpets.  Variegated cloth or carpet or red and green leather saddle-bags hung on  either side of the animals behind the saddles. The bridle and bit were  richly ornamented with shells and silver or iron knobs.    The few mud houses in the neighbourhood had flat roofs and were not  sufficiently typical nor inviting enough for a closer internal  inspection.    We are now on a tributary of the Shah-rud on the new road, instead of the  old caravan track, which we have left since Paichinar.    The country becomes more interesting and wild as we go on. In the  undoubtedly volcanic formation of the mountains one notices large patches  of sulphurous earth on the mountain-side, with dark red and black baked  soil above it. Over that, all along the range, curious column-like,  fluted rocks. Lower down the soil is saturated with sulphurous matter  which gives it a rich, dark blue tone with greenish tints in it and  bright yellow patches. The earth all round is of a warm burnt sienna  colour, intensified, when I saw it, by the reddish, soft rays of a dying  sun. It has all the appearance of having been subjected to abnormal heat.  The characteristic shape of the peaks of the range is conical, and a  great many deep-cut channels and holes are noticeable in the rocky sides  of these sugar-loaf mountains, as is frequently the case in mountains of  volcanic formation.    We rise higher and higher in zig-zag through rugged country, and we then  go across an intensely interesting large basin, which must at a previous  date have been the interior of an exploded and now collapsed volcano.  This place forcibly reminded me of a similar sight on a grander  scale,--the site of the ex-Bandaisan Mountain on the main island of  Nippon in Japan, after that enormous mountain was blown to atoms and  disappeared some few years ago. A huge basin was left, like the bottom  part of a gigantic cauldron, the edges of which bore ample testimony to  the terrific heat that must have been inside before the explosion took  place. In the Persian scene before us, of a much older date, the basin,  corroded as it evidently was by substances heated to a very high  temperature and by the action of forming gases, had been to a certain  extent obliterated by the softening actions of time and exposure to air.  The impression was not so violent and marked as the one received at  Bandaisan, which I visited only a few days after the explosion, but the  various characteristics were similar.    In the basin was a solitary hut, which rejoiced in the name of Kort.  These great commotions of nature are interesting, but to any one given to  sound reflection they are almost too big for the human mind to grasp.  They impress one, they almost frighten one, but give no reposeful, real  pleasure in gazing upon them such as less disturbed scenery does. The  contrasts in colour and shape are too violent, too crude to please the  eye: the freaks too numerous to be comprehensible at a glance. Here we  have a ditch with sides perfectly black-baked, evidently by lava or some  other hot substance which has flowed through; further on big splashes of  violent red and a great variety of warm browns. The eye roams from one  spot to the other, trying to understand exactly what has taken place--a  job which occupies a good deal of one's time and attention as one drives  through, and which would occupy a longer time and study than a gallop  through in a post landau can afford.    At Agha Baba we were again on the old track, quite flat now, and during  the night we galloped easily on a broad road through uninteresting  country till we reached Kasvin, 185 _versts_ from Resht.    Kasvin, in the province of Irak, is a very ancient city, which has seen  better days, has gone through a period of misfortune, and will in future  probably attain again a certain amount of prosperity. It is situated at  an altitude of 4,094 feet (at the Indo-European telegraph office), an  elevation which gives it a very hot but dry, healthy climate with  comparatively cool nights. The town is handsome, square in form, enclosed  in a wall with towers.    The governor's palace is quite impressive, with a fine broad avenue of  green trees leading from it to the spacious Kasvin rest-house. This is  by far the best rest-house on the road to the Persian capital, with large  rooms, clean enough for Persia, and with every convenience for cooking  one's food. Above the doorway the Persian lion, with the sun rising above  his back, has been elaborately painted, and a picturesque pool of  stagnant water at the bottom of the steps is no doubt the breeding spot  of mosquitoes and flies, of which there are swarms, to make one's life a  misery.    [Illustration: Making a _Kanat_.]    The palatial rest-house, the governor's palace, a mosque or two, and the  convenient bath-houses for Mahommedans being barred, there is nothing  particular to detain the traveller in Kasvin.    One hears that Kasvin occupied at one time a larger area than Teheran  to-day. The remains of this magnitude are certainly still there. The  destruction of the city, they say, has been due to many and varied  misfortunes. Earthquakes and famines in particular have played an  important part in the history of Kasvin, and they account for the many  streets and large buildings in ruins which one finds, such as the remains  of the Sufi Palace and the domed mosque. The city dates back to the  fourth century, but it was not till the sixteenth century that it became  the _Dar-el-Sultanat_--the seat of royalty--under Shah Tamasp. It  prospered as the royal city until the time of Shah Abbas, whose wisdom  made him foresee the dangers of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22125"],[0,"The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance (#11)"],[1,"tar-piece.      37.
