They had, with extreme difficulty, paid their way: and they had,  to a certain extent, educated the children. That, however, was Miss  Smith's doing.    \"We shall always feel, every one of us,\" said Mrs. Morell, with tears,  to the elderly homely governess, \"that we are under the deepest  obligations to you. But for you, the children would have grown up  without any education at all. And, for the greatest service you or any  one could possibly render us, we have never been able to give you your  due,--even as regards the mere money.\"    \"I can only say again,\" replied the governess, \"that you do not look at  the whole of the case. You have given me a home, when it is no easy  matter for such as I am to earn one, with my old-womanish ways and my  old-fashioned knowledge.\"    \"I will not hear any disparagement of your ways and your knowledge,\"  interrupted Mrs. Morell. \"They have been every thing to my children: and  if you could have gone with us....\"    This, however, they all knew to be out of the question. It was not only  that Miss Smith was between fifty and sixty, too old to go so far, with  little prospect of comfort at the end of the journey; but she was at  present disabled for much usefulness by the state of her right hand. It  had been hurt by an accident a long time before, and it did not get  well. The surgeon had always said it would be a long case; and she had  no use whatever of the hand in the mean time. Yet she would not part  with the baby till the last moment. She carried him on the left arm, and  stood on the wharf with him--the mother at her side--till all the rest  were on board, and Mr. Morell came for his wife. It was no grand steamer  they were going in, but a humble vessel belonging to the port, which  would carry them cheap.    \"Now, my love,\" said the husband. \"Now, Miss Smith,\" taking the child  from her. \"Words cannot tell....\"    And if words could have told, the tongue could not have uttered them. It  was little, too, that his wife could say.    \"Write to us. Be sure you write. We shall write as soon as we arrive.  Write to us.\"    Miss Smith glanced at the hand. She said only one word, \"Farewell!\" but  she said it cheerfully.    The steam-tug was in a hurry, and down the river they went. She had one  more appointment to keep with them. She was to wave her handkerchief  from the rocks by the fort; and the children were to let her try whether  she could see their little handkerchiefs. So she walked quickly over the  common to the fort, and sat down on the beach at the top of the rocks.    It was very well that she had something to do. But the plan did not  altogether answer. By the time the vessel crossed the bar it was nearly  dark, and she was not quite sure, among three, which it was, and she did  not suppose the children could see her handkerchief. She waved it,  however, according to promise. How little they knew how wet it was!    Then there was the walk home. It was familiar, yet very strange. When  she was a child her parents used to bring her here, in the summer time,  for sea air and bathing. The haven and the old gray bathing houses, and  the fort, and the lighthouse, and the old priory ruins crowning the  rocks, were all familiar to her; but the port had so grown up that all  else was strange. And how strange now was life to her! Her parents gone,  many years back, and her two sisters since; and now, the Morells! She  had never had any money to lose, and the retired way in which the  Morells lived had prevented her knowing any body out of their house. She  had not a relation nor a friend, nor even an acquaintance, in England.  The Morells had not been uneasy about her. They left her a little money,  and had so high an opinion of her that they did not doubt her being  abundantly employed, whenever her hand should get well. They had lived  too much to themselves to know that her French, learned during the war,  when nobody in England could pronounce French, would not do in these  days, nor that her trilling, old-fashioned style of playing on the  piano, which they thought so beautiful, would be laughed at now in any  boarding school; and that her elegant needleworks were quite out of  fashion; and that there were new ways of teaching even reading,  spelling, and writing.    She knew these things, and cautioned herself against discontent with the  progress of society, because she happened to be left alone behind. She  suspected, too, that the hand would not get well. The thing that she was  most certain of was, that she must not rack her brain with fears and  speculations as to what was to become of her. Her business was to wait  till she could find something to do, or learn what she was to suffer.  She thought she had better wait here. There was no call to any other  place. This was more familiar and more pleasant to her than any  other--the Morells' cottage being far away, and out of the question--and  here she could live with the utmost possible cheapness. So here she  staid.    The hand got well, as far as the pain was concerned, sooner than she had  expected. But it was in a different way from what she had expected. It  was left wholly useless. And, though the time was not long, it had  wrought as time does. It had worn out her clothes; it had emptied her  little purse. It had carried away every thing she had in the world but  the very few clothes she had on. She had been verging towards the  resolution she now took for three or four weeks. She took it finally  while sitting on the bench near the fort. It was in the dusk; for her  gown, though she had done her best to mend it with her left hand, was in  no condition to show by daylight. She was alone in the dusk, rather  hungry and very cold. The sea was dashing surlily upon the rocks below,  and there was too much mist to let any stars shine upon her. It was all  dreary enough; yet she was not very miserable, for her mind was made up.  She had made up her mind to go into the work-Pouse the next day. While  she was thinking calmly about it a fife began to play a sort of jig in  the yard of the fort behind her. Her heart heaved to her throat and the  tears gushed from her eyes. In this same spot, fifty years before, she  had heard what seemed to her the same fife. Her father was then sitting  on the grass, and she was between his knees, helping to tassel the tail  of a little kite they were going to fly; and, when the merry fife had  struck up, her father had snatched up her gay Harlequin that lay within  reach, and made him shake his legs and arms to the music. She heard her  own laugh again now, through that long course of fifty years, and in the  midst of these tears.    All that night she pondered her purpose: and the more she considered,  the more sure she was that it was right. \"I might,\" thought she, \"get  maintained by charity, no doubt: I might call on any of the clergymen of  this place, and the rich people. Or I might walk into the shops and tell  my story, and I dare say the people would give me food and clothes. And,  if it was a temporary distress, I would do so. I should think it right  to ask for help, if I had any prospect of work or independence in any  way. But I have none: and this, I am convinced, points out my duty.  Hopeless cases like mine are those which public charity--legal  charity--is intended to meet. My father little dreamed of this, to be  sure; and the Morells little dream of it at this moment. But when do our  parents and friends, when do we ourselves, dream of what our lot is  really to turn out? Those old notions have nothing to do, if we could  but think so, with the event. Nor has my disgust any thing to do with my  duty. The plain fact is, that I am growing old--that I am nearly  helpless--that I am cold and hungry, and nearly naked--that I have no  friends within reach, and no prospect whatever. I am, therefore, an  object for public charity, and I will ask for what is my due. I am  afraid of what I may find in the workhouse;--the vicious people, the  dirty people, the diseased people,--and, I suppose, not one among them  who can give me any companionship whatever.    \"It is dreadful; but it can't be helped. And the worse the case is about  my companions--my fellow-paupers--(for I must learn to bear the  word)--the greater are the chances of my finding something to do for  them;--something which may prevent my feeling myself utterly useless in  the world. This is not being wholly without prospect, after all. I  suppose nobody ever is. If it were not so cold now, I could sleep upon  mine.\"    It was too cold for sleep; and when, in the morning, she offered her old  shawl in payment for her bed, assuring the poor old woman who let it  that she should not want the shawl, because she was going to have other  clothes, the woman shook her head sorrowfully,--her lodger looked so wan  and chilled. She had no fear that there was any thought of suicide in  the case. No one could look in Miss Smith's sensible face, and hear her  steady, cheerful voice, and suppose that she would do any thing wild or  impatient.    \"Who is that woman with a book in her hand?\" inquired the visiting  Commissioner, some months afterwards, of the governor of the workhouse.  The governor could only say she was a single woman of the name of Smith,  who had no use of her right hand. As to who she was, he could tell no  more than this; but his wife had sometimes mentioned her as a different  sort of person from those they generally saw there. She could not only  read, but she read very well: and she read a great deal aloud to the old  people, and in the infirmary. She talked unlike the rest, too. She said  little; but her language was good, and always correct. She could not do  much on account of her infirmity: but she was always willing to do what  could be done with one hand; and she must have been very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/227"],[0,"Aeneidos (#11)"],[1,"Hyadas geminosque Triones,    armatumque auro circumspicit Oriona.

Iamque rubescebat stellis Aurora fugatis,    cum procul obscuros collis humilemque videmus    Italiam.  ''Italiam'' primus conclamat Achates,    ''Italiam'' laeto socii clamore salutant.    Tum pater Anchises magnum cratera corona    induit, implevitque mero, divosque vocavit    stans celsa in puppi:    'Di maris et terrae tempestatumque potentes,    ferte viam vento facilem et spirate secundi.'    Crebrescunt optatae aurae portusque patescit    iam propior, templumque adparet in arce Minervae.    Vela legunt socii et proras ad litora torquent.    Portus ab Euroo fluctu curvatus in arcum,    obiectae salsa spumant aspargine cautes;    ipse latet; gemino demittunt bracchia muro    turriti scopuli, refugitque ab litore templum.    Quattuor hic, primum omen, equos in gramine vidi    tondentis campum late, candore nivali.    Et pater Anchises:  'Bellum, O terra hospita, portas    bello armantur equi, bellum haec armenta minantur.    Sed tamen idem olim curru succedere sueti    quadrupedes, et frena iugo concordia ferre;    spes et pacis' ait.  Tum numina sancta precamur    Palladis armisonae, quae prima accepit ovantis,    et capita ante aras Phrygio velamur amictu;    praeceptisque Heleni, dederat quae maxima, rite    Iunoni Argivae iussos adolemus honores.      Haud mora, continuo perfectis ordine votis,    cornua velatarum obvertimus antemarum,    Graiugenumque domos suspectaque linquimus arva.    Hinc sinus Herculei (si vera est fama) Tarenti    cernitur; attollit se diva Lacinia contra,    Caulonisque arces et navifragum Scylaceum.    Tum procul e fluctu Trinacria cernitur Aetna,    et gemitum ingentem pelagi pulsataque saxa    audimus longe fractasque ad litora voces,    exsultantque vada, atque aestu miscentur harenae.    Et pater Anchises:  'Nimirum haec illa Charybdis:    hos Helenus scopulos, haec saxa horrenda canebat.    Eripite, O socii, pariterque insurgite remis!'      Haud minus ac iussi faciunt, primusque rudentem    contorsit laevas proram Palinurus ad undas.    laevam cuncta cohors remis ventisque petivit.    Tollimur in caelum curvato gurgite, et idem    subducta ad Manis imos desedimus unda.    Ter scopuli clamorem inter cava saxa dedere:    ter spumam elisam et rorantia vidimus astra.    Interea fessos ventus cum sole reliquit,    ignarique viae Cyclopum adlabimur oris.      Portus ab accessu ventorum immotus et ingens    ipse; sed horrificis iuxta tonat Aetna ruinis;    interdumque atram prorumpit ad aethera nubem,    turbine fumantem piceo et candente favilla,    attollitque globos flammarum et sidera lambit;    interdum scopulos avolsaque viscera montis    erigit eructans, liquefactaque saxa sub auras    cum gemitu glomerat, fundoque exaestuat imo.    Fama est Enceladi semustum fulmine corpus    urgueri mole hac, ingentemque insuper Aetnam    impositam ruptis flammam exspirare caminis;    et fessum quotiens mutet latus, intremere omnem    murmure Trinacriam, et caelum subtexere fumo.    Noctem illam tecti silvis immania monstra    perferimus, nec quae sonitum det causa videmus.    Nam neque erant astrorum ignes, nec lucidus aethra    siderea polus, obscuro sed nubila caelo,    et lunam in nimbo nox intempesta tenebat.      Postera iamque dies primo surgebat Eoo,    umentemque Aurora polo dimoverat umbram:    cum subito e silvis, macie confecta suprema,    ignoti nova forma viri miserandaque cultu    procedit, supplexque manus ad litora tendit.    Respicimus:  dira inluvies inmissaque barba,    consertum tegumen spinis; at cetera Graius,    [et quondam patriis ad Troiam missus in armis.]    Isque ubi Dardanios habitus et Troia vidit    arma procul, paulum aspectu conterritus haesit,    continuitque gradum; mox sese ad litora praeceps    cum fletu precibusque tulit:  'Per sidera testor,    per superos atque hoc caeli spirabile lumen,    tollite me, Teucri; quascumque abducite terras;    hoc sat erit.  Scio me Danais e classibus unum,    et bello Iliacos fateor petiisse Penatis;    pro quo, si sceleris tanta est iniuria nostri,    spargite me in fluctus, vastoque inmergite ponto.    Si pereo, hominum manibus periisse iuvabit.'    Dixerat, et genua amplexus genibusque volutans    haerebat.  Qui sit, fari, quo sanguine cretus,    hortamur; quae deinde agitet fortuna, fateri.    Ipse pater dextram Anchises, haud multa moratus,    dat iuveni, atque animum praesenti pignore firmat.    Ille haec, deposita tandem formidine, fatur:      'Sum patria ex Ithaca, comes infelicis Ulixi,    nomine Achaemenides, Troiam genitore Adamasto    paupere---mansissetque utinam fortuna!---profectus.    Hic me, dum trepidi crudelia limina linquunt,    inmemores socii vasto Cyclopis in antro    deseruere.  Domus sanie dapibusque cruentis,    intus opaca, ingens; ipse arduus, altaque pulsat    sidera---Di, talem terris avertite pestem!---    nec visu facilis nec dictu adfabilis ulli.    Visceribus miserorum et sanguine vescitur atro.    Vidi egomet, duo de numero cum corpora nostro    prensa manu magna, medio resupinus in antro,    frangeret ad saxum, sanieque aspersa natarent    limina; vidi atro cum membra fluentia tabo    manderet, et tepidi tremerent sub dentibus artus.    Haud impune quidem; nec talia passus Ulixes,    oblitusve sui est Ithacus discrimine tanto.    Nam simul expletus dapibus vinoque sepultus    cervicem inflexam posuit, iacuitque per antrum    immensus, saniem eructans et frusta cruento    per somnum commixta mero, nos magna precati    numina sortitique vices, una undique circum    fundimur, et telo lumen terebramus acuto,---    ingens, quod torva solum sub fronte latebat,    Argolici clipei aut Phoebeae lampadis instar,---    et tandem laeti sociorum ulciscimur umbras.    Sed fugite, O miseri, fugite, atque ab litore funem    rumpite.      Nam qualis quantusque cavo Polyphemus in antro    lanigeras claudit pecudes atque ubera pressat,    centum alii curva haec habitant ad litora volgo    infandi Cyclopes, et altis montibus errant.    Tertia iam lunae se cornua lumine complent,    cum vitam in silvis inter deserta ferarum    lustra domosque traho, vastosque ab rupe Cyclopas    prospicio, sonitumque pedum vocemque tremesco.    Victum infelicem, bacas lapidosaque corna,    dant rami et volsis pascunt radicibus herbae.    Omnia conlustrans, hanc primum ad litora classem    conspexi venientem.  Huic me, quaecumque fuisset,    addixi:  satis est gentem effugisse nefandam.    Vos animam hanc potius quocumque absumite leto.'      Vix ea fatus erat, summo cum monte videmus    ipsum inter pecudes vasta se mole moventem    pastorem Polyphemum et litora nota petentem,    monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum.    Trunca manu pinus regit et vestigia firmat;    lanigerae comitantur oves---ea sola voluptas    solamenque mali.    Postquam altos tetigit fluctus et ad aequora venit,    luminis effossi fluidum lavit inde cruorem,    dentibus infrendens gemitu, graditurque per aequor    iam medium, necdum fluctus latera ardua tinxit.    Nos procul inde fugam trepidi celerare, recepto    supplice sic merito, tacitique incidere funem;    vertimus et proni certantibus aequora remis.    Sensit, et ad sonitum vocis vestigia torsit;    verum ubi nulla datur dextra adfectare potestas,    nec potis Ionios fluctus aequare sequendo,    clamorem immensum tollit, quo pontus et omnes    contremuere undae, penitusque exterrita tellus    Italiae, curvisque immugiit Aetna cavernis.      At genus e silvis Cyclopum et montibus altis    excitum ruit ad portus et litora complent.    Cernimus adstantis nequiquam lumine torvo    Aetnaeos fratres, caelo capita alta ferentis,    concilium horrendum:  quales cum vertice celso    aeriae quercus, aut coniferae cyparissi    constiterunt, silva alta Iovis, lucusve Dianae.    Praecipites metus acer agit quocumque rudentis    excutere, et ventis intendere vela secundis.    Contra iussa monent Heleni Scyllam atque Charybdin    inter, utramque viam leti discrimine parvo,    ni teneant cursus; certum est dare lintea retro.    Ecce autem Boreas angusta ab sede Pelori    missus adest.  Vivo praetervehor ostia saxo    Pantagiae Megarosque sinus Thapsumque iacentem.    Talia monstrabat relegens errata retrorsus    litora Achaemenides; comes infelicis Ulixi.      Sicanio praetenta sinu iacet insula contra    Plemyrium undosum; nomen dixere priores    Ortygiam.  Alpheum fama est huc Elidis amnem    occultas egisse vias subter mare; qui nunc    ore, Arethusa, tuo Siculis confunditur undis.    Iussi numina magna loci veneramur; et inde    exsupero praepingue solum stagnantis Helori.    Hinc altas cautes proiectaque saxa Pachyni    radimus, et fatis numquam concessa moveri    adparet Camerina procul campique Geloi,    immanisque Gela fluvii cognomine dicta.    Arduus inde Acragas ostentat maxuma longe    moenia, magnanimum quondam generator equorum;    teque datis linquo ventis, palmosa Selinus,    et vada dura lego saxis Lilybeia caecis.      Hinc Drepani me portus et inlaetabilis ora    accipit.  Hic, pelagi tot tempestatibus actis,    heu genitorem, omnis curae casusque levamen,    amitto Anchisen:  hic me, pater optume, fessum    deseris, heu, tantis nequiquam erepte periclis!    Nec vates Helenus, cum multa horrenda moneret,    hos mihi praedixit luctus, non dira Celaeno.    Hic labor extremus, longarum haec meta viarum.    Hinc me digressum vestris deus adpulit oris.
