The occupants, Stephanie and her room-mate, Beth Broadway, were  far too absorbed to think of looking up towards the ceiling. Their  attention was concentrated on the parcel which had arrived by the post.  It contained a small bottle, carefully packed in shavings, and also a  typewritten letter, the purport of which seemed to electrify Stephanie.    \"It's the most extraordinary thing I've ever heard!\" she was saying.  \"Beth, just listen to this.\"    And she read aloud:                \"66 HOLBORN VIADUCT,                   LONDON.    \"DEAR MADAM,    \"Having seen your portrait, as a noted beauty, published in _The  Princess_, _The Ladies' Court Journal_, and other leading pictorials,  we venture to submit to you a sample of our famous Eau de Venus, an  invaluable adjunct to the toilet of any lady possessing a delicate  complexion. It is a perfectly harmless, fragrantly scented fluid, which,  if applied daily after breakfast, produces a rose-leaf bloom which is  absolutely incomparable. As it is a new preparation, we are anxious to  submit it to a few ladies of influence in the fashionable world, feeling  sure that, once used, they will recommend it.    \"We shall esteem it a great favour if you will graciously try the  enclosed sample. We do not ask for testimonials, but any expression of  appreciation from one who figured so admirably as Queen of the Roses at  the Barrfield Pageant would be to us a source of immense gratification.    \"May we recommend that the preparation be applied immediately after  breakfast, as its ingredients are more potent to the delicate pores of  the skin if used at that period of the morning.    \"With apologies for troubling you, and hoping you will condescend to  give our Eau de Venus at least a trial,        \"We remain,          \"Faithfully yours,            \"RENAN, MARIETTE, ET CIE,             Parfumeurs.\"    \"How very peculiar!\" gasped Beth, much impressed.    \"It must be because they saw my photo in the papers,\" said Stephanie.  She was trying to speak casually, and not to appear too flattered, but  her eyes shone. \"I believe that pageant made rather a sensation, and of  course, well, I was the principal figure in it. I suppose I shall have  to try this Eau de Venus.\"    \"It's in a funny little bottle,\" commented Beth.    \"Samples generally are. They never send you very much of a thing. They  want you to buy a big bottle afterwards.\"    Stephanie carefully removed the cork. The preparation seemed to be of a  pink, milky description.    \"It smells of violets,\" she said, offering the bottle for Beth to sniff.    \"I should certainly try it, if I were you,\" recommended the latter.    \"It says it's quite harmless,\" continued Stephanie, referring to the  letter, \"and should be used immediately after breakfast. Well, there's  no time like the present!\"    If there was a curious agitation on the other side of the partition,  neither girl noticed it. Stephanie poured some of the liquid into her  hand and rubbed it over her face. Then she turned to the looking-glass.    \"It seems very pink and queer! It's all in red streaks!\"    \"Perhaps you've put on too much. Wipe some of it off,\" advised Beth.    Vigorous measures with a sponge followed, and Stephanie anxiously  surveyed the result.    \"It won't come off!\" she faltered. \"Oh, what have I done to myself? I'm  all red smears!\"    Her dismay was too much for one at least on the other side of the  partition. Rona broke into a loud, cackling laugh. One swift glance  upwards and Stephanie realized that she was the victim of a practical  joke. It took her exactly three seconds to reach the next cubicle.    \"So it's you, is it?\" she exploded. \"Well, Ulyth Stanton, I am  astonished! Evil communications corrupt good manners, and yours smack of  the backwoods.\"    \"Don't throw it on Ulyth; she knew nothing about it,\" retorted the  chuckling Cuckoo belligerently. \"It's my business, and I don't mind  telling you so!\"    \"I might have known, you--you utter cad! You don't deserve to be in a  school among ladies!\"    \"Go on. Pitch it as strong as you like. The cub's quits with you now for  all your airs and your nastiness.\"    \"Oh, don't!\" protested Ulyth, interfering in much distress. \"Rona, do  stop! I'd no idea you meant to play such a dreadful trick on Stephie.\"    \"You must have known something of it, or you wouldn't have come to look  on. I expect you were at the bottom of it,\" sneered Stephanie; \"so don't  try to sneak out of it, Ulyth Stanton. Your precious joke has marked me  for life.\"    \"No, no! It's only cochineal and milk. I got it from the cook,\" put in  the Cuckoo.    \"It's stained her face all over, though,\" said Beth Broadway  reproachfully.    \"I shall go straight to Miss Bowes,\" whimpered Stephanie.    \"I wouldn't do that if I were you,\" said Ulyth. \"Try some methylated  spirit first. I'll give you some from my room.\"    The remedy proved efficacious. The stains yielded to gentle rubbing, and  the four girls flew in a wild hurry to make their beds, three much  relieved and one naughtily exultant.    \"I've paid out Stephie,\" panted Rona, tucking in her blankets anyhow. \"I  felt proud of that letter. Made it up with the help of advertisements in  the _Illustrated Journal_. Then I typed it in the study while Teddie was  out. You didn't know I could type? Learnt how on the voyage, from a girl  who'd a typewriter on board with her. I laid on the butter pretty thick.  I knew Steph would swallow it to any amount. Oh, didn't she just look  flattered? It was prime! The under-housemaid posted the parcel for me.\"    \"Stephie'll never forgive you!\"    \"Much I care!\"          CHAPTER VII    The Cuckoo's Progress      \"Your bear cub still needs taming, Ulyth,\" said Gertrude Oliver. \"She  spilt her coffee this morning--such a mess on the tablecloth! I wish I  didn't sit next to her. I felt like Alice at the March Hare's  tea-party.\"    \"It was half Maud's fault; she jerked her elbow,\" pleaded Ulyth in  extenuation.    \"Oh, you can't whitewash her, so don't try! I won't say she isn't better  than when she arrived, but there's room for improvement.\"    \"She's much slimmer. I suppose it must have been the voyage that had  made her grow so fat in September.\"    \"I wish, at any rate, you could get her out of using those dreadful  backwoods expressions. It's high time she dropped them. She's been here  nearly a full term.\"    Ulyth thought so too, and the next time she found a suitable opportunity  she tackled Rona on the subject.    \"You're too nice to speak in such a queer way. You've no idea how it  spoils you,\" she urged. \"You could be another girl if you'd only take a  little trouble.\"    \"What's the use? Who minds what I'm like?\" returned the Cuckoo a trifle  defiantly.    \"I do,\" said Ulyth emphatically.    \"Not really?\"    \"Indeed I do. I care very much. You came over here to be my friend, and  there are many things I want in a friend.\"    \"I didn't know you cared,\" replied Rona in a softened voice. \"No one  ever did before--except Dad, when he said I was a savage.\"    \"Don't you want to show him what you can grow into?\" asked Ulyth  eagerly. \"Think how surprised and pleased he'll be when he sees you  again!\"    \"There's something in that.\"    \"There's a great deal in it. I know I often make myself do things I  don't want because of Mother; she's such a darling, and----\" She stopped  short, realizing too late the mistake she was making.    \"I can't remember Mother,\" answered Rona, turning away with a suggestive  cough. \"It's all very well for you.\"    Ulyth could have bitten her tongue out. She said no more, for she knew  her room-mate well enough by this time to have learnt that sympathy must  be offered with the utmost discretion. The poor Cuckoo was only too well  aware of the deficiencies in her home and upbringing, but the least hint  of them from others immediately put her on the defensive. In her own way  she was very proud, and though there was a vast difference between  Stephanie's stinging remarks and Ulyth's well-meant kindness, anything  that savoured of compassion wounded her dignity.    The conversation brought urgently to Ulyth a question which had been  disturbing her, and which she had persistently tried to banish from her  thoughts. Where was Rona going to spend Christmas? So far as anyone knew  she had not a friend or relation in the British Isles. Miss Bowes and  Miss Teddington always went away for the holidays, and The Woodlands was  left in the charge of servants. Rona could not stay at the school,  surely? Had Miss Bowes made any arrangement for her? Ulyth vacillated  for at least five minutes, then took out her writing-case and began a  letter home.    \"BEST-BELOVED MOTHERKINS,    \"I am such a nasty, horrid, selfish thing! In every one of your letters  you have hinted and hinted and hinted that we should ask Rona for  Christmas. You wouldn't say it outright until you were sure I wanted it.  That was just the rub. I didn't want it. I'm afraid even now I don't  quite. I've had her all the term, and I thought it would be so blissful  to be without her for four whole weeks, and have you and Father and  Oswald and Dorothy and Peter just to myself. But oh, Motherkins, she's  such a lonely waif of a girl! I'm so dreadfully sorry for her. She seems  always out of everything. I'm sure she's never had a decent Christmas in  her life. I believe she's fond of her father, though I don't think he  took very much notice of her--she let out once that he was so  disappointed she wasn't a boy. But Mrs. Barker, the housekeeper, must  have been a most terrible person. Rona had no chance at all.    \"Motherkins, she's never seen a real English home, and I'd like to show  her ours. Yes, I would, although in a way she'll spoil everything. May  she sleep in the spare room, and let me have my own to myself? I could  stand it then.    \"Dearest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20733"],[0,"Critical Miscellanies (Vol. 1 of 3), Essay 1: Robespierre (#11)"],[1,"what better proof can we have  that if France was to be delivered from restored feudalism and foreign  spoliation, the momentous task must be performed by those who had sense  to discern the awful peril, and energy to encounter it?    The Girondins had made their incapacity plain. The execution of the King  had filled them with alarm, and with hatred against the ruder and more  robust party who had forced that startling act of vengeance upon them.  Puny social disgusts prevented them from co-operating with Danton or  with Robespierre. Prussia and Austria were not more redoubtable or more  hateful to them than was Paris, and they wasted, in futile  recriminations about the September massacres or the alleged peculations  of municipal officers, the time and the energy that should have been  devoted without let or interruption to the settlement of the  administration and the repulse of the foe. It is impossible to think of  such fine characters as Vergniaud or Madame Roland without admiration,  or of their untimely fate without pity. But the deliverance of a people  beset by strong and implacable enemies could not wait on mere good  manners and fastidious sentiments, when these comely things were in  company with the most stupendous want of foresight ever shown by a  political party. How can we measure the folly of men who so missed the  conditions of the problem as to cry out in the Convention itself, almost  within earshot of the Jacobin Club, that if any insult were offered to  the national representation, the departments would rise, 'Paris would be  annihilated; and men would come to search on the banks of the Seine  whether such a city had ever existed!' It was to no purpose that Danton  urgently rebuked the senseless animosity with which the Right poured  incessant malediction on the Left, and the wild shrieking hate with  which the Left retaliated on the Right. The battle was to the death, and  it was the Girondins who first menaced their political foes with  vengeance and the guillotine. As it happened, the treason of Dumouriez  and their own ineptitude destroyed them before revenge was within reach.  Such a consummation was fortunate for their country. It was the  Girondins whose want of union and energy had by the middle of 1793  brought France to distraction and imminent ruin. It was a short year of  Jacobin government that by the summer of 1794 had welded the nation  together again, and finally conquered the invasion. The city of the  Seine had once more shown itself what it had been for nine centuries,  ever since the days of Odo, Count of Paris and first King of the French,  not merely a capital, but France itself, 'its living heart and surest  bulwark.'    The immediate instrument of so rapid and extraordinary an achievement  was the Committee of Public Safety. The French have never shown their  quick genius for organisation with more triumphant vigour. While the  Girondins were still powerful, nine members of the Convention had been  constituted an executive committee, April 6, 1793. They were in fact a  kind of permanent cabinet, with practical irresponsibility. In the  summer of 1793 the number was increased from nine to twelve, and these  twelve were the centre of the revolutionary government. They fell into  three groups. First, there were the scientific or practical  administrators, of whom the most eminent was Carnot. Next came the  directors of internal policy, the pure revolutionists, headed by Billaud  de Varennes. Finally, there was a trio whose business it was to  translate action into the phrases of revolutionary policy. This famous  group was Robespierre, Couthon, and Saint Just.    Besides the Committee of Public Safety there was another chief  governmental committee, that of General Security. Its functions were  mainly connected with the police, the arrests, and the prisons, but in  all serious affairs the two Committees deliberated in common. There were  also fourteen other groups of various size, taken from the Convention;  they applied themselves with admirable zeal, and usually not with more  zeal than skill, to schemes of public instruction, of finance, of  legislation, of the administration of justice, and a host of other civil  reforms, of all of which Napoleon Bonaparte was by and by to reap the  credit. These bodies completed the civil revolution, which the  Constituent and the Legislative Assemblies had left so mischievously  incomplete that, as soon as ever the Convention had assembled, it was  besieged by a host of petitioners praying them to explain and to pursue  the abolition of the old feudal rights. Everything had still been left  uncertain in men's minds, even upon that greatest of all the  revolutionary questions. The feudal division of the committee of general  legislation had in this eleventh hour to decide innumerable issues, from  those of the widest practical importance, down to the prayer of a remote  commune to be relieved from the charge of maintaining a certain mortuary  lamp which had been a matter of seignorial obligation. The work done by  the radical jurisconsults was never undone. It was the great and  durable reward of the struggle. And we have to remember that these  industrious and efficient bodies, as well as all other public bodies and  functionaries whatever, were placed by the definite revolutionary  constitution of 1793 under the direct orders of the Committee of Public  Safety.           *       *       *       *       *    It is hardly possible even now for any one who exults in the memory of  the great deliverance of a brilliant and sociable people, to stand  unmoved before the walls of that palace which Philibert Delorme reared  for Catherine de' Medici, and which was thrown into ruin by the madness  of a band of desperate men in our own days. Lewis had walked forth from  the Tuileries on the fatal morning of the Tenth of August, holding his  children by the hand, and lightly noticing, as he traversed the gardens,  how early that year the leaves were falling. Lewis had by this time  followed the fallen leaves into nothingness. The palace of the kings was  now styled the Palace of the Nation, and the new republic carried on its  work surrounded by the outward associations of the old monarchy. The  Convention after the spring of 1793 held its sittings in what had  formerly been the palace theatre. Fierce men from the Faubourgs of St.  Antoine and St. Marceau, and fiercer women from the markets, shouted  savage applause or menace from galleries, where not so long ago the  Italian buffoons had amused the perpetual leisure of the finest ladies  and proudest grandees of France. The Committee of General Security  occupied the Pavillon de Marsan, looking over a dingy space that the  conqueror at Rivoli afterwards made the most dazzling street in Europe.  The Committee of Public Safety sat in the Pavillon de Flore, at the  opposite end of the Tuileries on the river bank. The approaches were  protected by guns and by a bodyguard, while inside there flitted to and  fro a cloud of familiars, who have been compared by the enemies of the  great Committee to the mutes of the court of the Grand Turk. Any one who  had business with this awful body had to grope his way along gloomy  corridors, that were dimly lighted by a single lamp at either end. The  room in which the Committee sat round a table of green cloth was  incongruously gay with the clocks, the bronzes, the mirrors, the  tapestries, of the ruined court. The members met at eight in the morning  and worked until one; from one to four they attended the sitting of the  Convention. In the evening they met again, and usually sat until night  was far advanced. It was no wonder if their hue became cadaverous, their  eyes hollow and bloodshot, their brows stern, their glance preoccupied  and sinister. Between ten and eleven every evening a sombre piece of  business was transacted, which has half effaced in the memory of  posterity all the heroic industry of the rest of the twenty-four hours.  It was then that Fouquier-Tinville, the public prosecutor, brought an  account of his day's labour; how the revolutionary tribunal was working,  how many had been convicted and how many acquitted, how large or how  small had been the batch of the guillotine since the previous night.  Across the breadth of the gardens, beyond their trees and fountains,  stood the Monster itself, with its cruel symmetry, its colour as of the  blood of the dead, its unheeding knife, neutral as the Fates.    Robespierre has been held responsible for all the violences of the  revolutionary government, and his position on the Committee appeared to  be exceedingly strong. It was, however, for a long time much less strong  in reality than it seemed: all depended upon successfully playing off  one force against another, and at the same time maintaining himself at  the centre of the see-saw. Robespierre was the literary and rhetorical  member of the band; he was the author of the strident manifestoes in  which Europe listened with exasperation to the audacious hopes and  unfaltering purpose of the new France. This had the effect of investing  him in the eyes of foreign nations with supreme and undisputed authority  over the government. The truth is, that Robespierre was both disliked  and despised by his colleagues. They thought of him as a mere maker of  useful phrases; he in turn secretly looked down upon them, as the man  who has a doctrine and a system in his head always looks down upon the  man who lives from hand to mouth. If the Committee had been in the place  of a government which has no opposition to fear, Robespierre would have  been one of its least powerful members. But although the government was  strong, there were at least three potent elements of opposition even  within the ranks of the dominant revolutionary party itself.    Three bodies in Paris were, each of them, the centre of an influence  that might at any moment"]]]
