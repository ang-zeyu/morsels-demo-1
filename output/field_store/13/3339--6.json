[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2071"],[0,"Stories (#11)"],[1,"    There was only one other beside Patrasche to whom Nello could talk at  all of his daring fantasies. This other was little Alois, who lived at  the old red mill on the grassy mound, and whose father, the miller, was  the best-to-do husbandman in all the village. Little Alois was only a  pretty baby with soft round, rosy features, made lovely by those sweet  dark eyes that the Spanish rule has left in so many a Flemish face,  in testimony of the Alvan dominion, as Spanish art has left broad-sown  throughout the country majestic palaces and stately courts, gilded  house-fronts and sculptured lintels--histories in blazonry and poems in  stone.    Little Alois was often with Nello and Patrasche. They played in the  fields, they ran in the snow, they gathered the daisies and bilberries,  they went up to the old gray church together, and they often sat  together by the broad wood fire in the mill-house. Little Alois, indeed,  was the richest child in the hamlet. She had neither brother nor sister;  her blue serge dress had never a hole in it; at kermess she had as many  gilded nuts and Agni Dei in sugar as her hands could hold; and when she  went up for her first communion her flaxen curls were covered with a  cap of richest Mechlin lace, which had been her mother's and her  grandmother's before it came to her. Men spoke already, though she had  but twelve years, of the good wife she would be for their sons to woo  and win; but she herself was a little gay, simple child, in no wise  conscious of her heritage, and she loved no playfellows so well as Jehan  Daas's grandson and his dog.    One day her father, Baas Cogez, a good man, but somewhat stern, came on  a pretty group in the long meadow behind the mill, where the aftermath  had that day been cut. It was his little daughter sitting amid the hay,  with the great tawny head of Patrasche on her lap, and many wreaths of  poppies and blue corn-flowers round them both; on a clean smooth slab of  pine wood the boy Nello drew their likeness with a stick of charcoal.    The miller stood and looked at the portrait with tears in his eyes--it  was so strangely like, and he loved his only child closely and well.  Then he roughly chid the little girl for idling there while her mother  needed her within, and sent her indoors crying and afraid; then,  turning, he snatched the wood from Nello's hands. \"Dost do much of such  folly?\" he asked, but there was a tremble in his voice.    Nello coloured and hung his head. \"I draw everything I see,\" he  murmured.    The miller was silent; then he stretched his hand out with a franc in  it. \"It is folly, as I say, and evil waste of time; nevertheless, it is  like Alois, and will please the house-mother. Take this silver bit for  it and leave it for me.\"    The colour died out of the face of the young Ardennois; he lifted  his head and put his hands behind his back. \"Keep your money and the  portrait both, Baas Cogez,\" he said, simply. \"You have been often good  to me.\" Then he called Patrasche to him, and walked away across the  fields.    \"I could have seen them with that franc,\" he murmured to Patrasche, \"but  I could not sell her picture--not even for them.\"    Baas Cogez went into his mill-house sore troubled in his mind. \"That  lad must not be so much with Alois,\" he said to his wife that night.  \"Trouble may come of it hereafter; he is fifteen now, and she is twelve;  and the boy is comely of face and form.\"    \"And he is a good lad and a loyal,\" said the housewife, feasting her  eyes on the piece of pine wood where it was throned above the chimney  with a cuckoo clock in oak and a Calvary in wax.    \"Yea, I do not gainsay that,\" said the miller, draining his pewter  flagon.    \"Then, if what you think of were ever to come to pass,\" said the wife,  hesitatingly, \"would it matter so much? She will have enough for both,  and one cannot be better than happy.\"    \"You are a woman, and therefore a fool,\" said the miller, harshly,  striking his pipe on the table. \"The lad is naught but a beggar, and,  with these painter's fancies, worse than a beggar. Have a care that they  are not together in the future, or I will send the child to the surer  keeping of the nuns of the Sacred Heart.\"    The poor mother was terrified, and promised humbly to do his will. Not  that she could bring herself altogether to separate the child from  her favorite playmate, nor did the miller even desire that extreme of  cruelty to a young lad who was guilty of nothing except poverty. But  there were many ways in which little Alois was kept away from her chosen  companion; and Nello, being a boy proud and quiet and sensitive,  was quickly wounded, and ceased to turn his own steps and those of  Patrasche, as he had been used to do with every moment of leisure, to  the old red mill upon the slope. What his offence was he did not know;  he supposed he had in some manner angered Baas Cogez by taking the  portrait of Alois in the meadow; and when the child who loved him would  run to him and nestle her hand in his, he would smile at her very sadly  and say with a tender concern for her before himself, \"Nay, Alois, do  not anger your father. He thinks that I make you idle, dear, and he is  not pleased that you should be with me. He is a good man and loves you  well; we will not anger him, Alois.\"    But it was with a sad heart that he said it, and the earth did not look  so bright to him as it had used to do when he went out at sunrise under  the poplars down the straight roads with Patrasche. The old red mill had  been a landmark to him, and he had been used to pause by it, going and  coming, for a cheery greeting with its people as her little flaxen head  rose above the low mill wicket, and her little rosy hands had held out  a bone or a crust to Patrasche. Now the dog looked wistfully at a closed  door, and the boy went on without pausing, with a pang at his heart, and  the child sat within with tears dropping slowly on the knitting to which  she was set on her little stool by the stove; and Baas Cogez, working  among his sacks and his mill-gear, would harden his will and say to  himself, \"It is best so. The lad is all but a beggar, and full of idle,  dreaming fooleries. Who knows what mischief might not come of it in the  future?\" So he was wise in his generation, and would not have the door  unbarred, except upon rare and formal occasions, which seemed to have  neither warmth nor mirth in them to the two children, who had been  accustomed so long to a daily gleeful, careless, happy interchange of  greeting, speech, and pastime, with no other watcher of their sports or  auditor of their fancies than Patrasche, sagely shaking the brazen bells  of his collar and responding with all a dog's swift sympathies to their  every change of mood.    All this while the little panel of pine wood remained over the chimney  in the mill kitchen with the cuckoo clock and the waxen Calvary; and  sometimes it seemed to Nello a little hard that while his gift was  accepted, he himself should be denied.    But he did not complain; it was his habit to be quiet. Old Jehan Daas  had said ever to him, \"We are poor; we must take what God sends--the ill  with the good; the poor cannot choose.\"    To which the boy had always listened in silence, being reverent of his  old grandfather; but nevertheless a certain vague, sweet hope, such as  beguiles the children of genius, had whispered in his heart, \"Yet the  poor do choose sometimes--choose to be great, so that men cannot say  them nay.\" And he thought so still in his innocence; and one day, when  the little Alois, finding him by chance alone among the corn-fields by  the canal, ran to him and held him close, and sobbed piteously because  the morrow would be her saint's day, and for the first time in all her  life her parents had failed to bid him to the little supper and romp in  the great barns with which her feast-day was always celebrated, Nello  had kissed her and murmured to her in firm faith, \"It shall be different  one day, Alois. One day that little bit of pine wood that your father  has of mine shall be worth its weight in silver; and he will not shut  the door against me then. Only love me always, dear little Alois; only  love me always, and I will be great.\"    \"And if I do not love you?\" the pretty child asked, pouting a little  through her tears, and moved by the instinctive coquetries of her sex.    Nello's eyes left her face and wandered to the distance, where, in the  red and gold of the Flemish night, the cathedral spire rose. There was a  smile on his face so sweet and yet so sad that little Alois was awed by  it. \"I will be great still,\" he said under his breath--\"great still, or  die, Alois.\"    \"You do not love me,\" said the little spoiled child, pushing him away;  but the boy shook his head and smiled, and went on his way through the  tall yellow corn, seeing as in a vision some day in a fair future when  he should come into that old familiar land and ask Alois of her people,  and be not refused or denied, but received in honour; while the village  folk should throng to look upon him and say in one another's ears, \"Dost  see him? He is a king among men; for he is a great artist and the world  speaks his name; and yet he was only our poor little Nello, who was a  beggar, as one may say, and only got his bread by the help of his dog.\"  And he thought how he would fold his grandsire in furs and purples, and  portray him as the old man is portrayed in the Family in the chapel of  St. Jacques; and of how he would hang the throat of Patrasche with a  collar of gold, and place him on his right hand, and say to the people,  \"This was once my only friend;\" and of how he would build himself a  great white marble palace, and make to himself luxuriant gardens of  pleasure, on the slope looking outward to where the cathedral spire  rose, and not dwell in it himself, but summon to it, as to a home, all  men young and poor and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20729"],[0,"At the Point of the Bayonet: A Tale of the Mahratta War (#11)"],[1," now send you with a duplicate letter to Purseram Bhow for,  since the terrible accident to Mahdoo Rao, whom I loved dearly for  his amiable character, it is probable that the adherents of Bajee  Rao have been active; and that my every movement is watched, and  attempts may be made to stop any messengers that I may send out.  Take Sufder's troop with you. If you are stopped, fight your way  through, whatever their force. It is a matter of supreme importance  that this letter should reach the general.\"    \"It shall reach him, my lord,\" Harry said, as he took it; \"in five  minutes I shall be on my way.\"    Going to his room he changed his attire, mounted his horse, and  rode to Sufder's camp. The men were all ready, as Nana had sent an  order to Sufder to prepare instantly for a journey.    \"So it is you, Puntojee!\" the captain said, as he rode up; \"the  orderly did not tell me whom I was to escort, nor our destination.  In which direction do we ride?\"    \"I am bearer of a letter to Purseram Bhow.\"    \"Then I know the direction;\" and, giving orders to his men, he rode  off at once by the side of Harry.    \"This is a terrible business, Puntojee.\"    \"I am greatly grieved, indeed, for no one could have been kinder to  me than Mahdoo Rao.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" Sufder said; \"that is all very well, but the serious  side of the matter is that, just as everything seemed settled, we  may be entering upon another civil war, more terrible than the  last. Of course, I am sorry for the young Peishwa; but I doubt  whether he was in any way fit to rule over the Mahrattas. Kindness  of heart goes for nothing with a people like ours; split up into  many factions, led by many chiefs, and ever ready for war. It needs  a strong, as well as an able man to hold in check all the parties  in the state.    \"Scindia was the sort of man to rule us. He was strong in every  way, was troubled with no scruples, would strike down without mercy  any who opposed him. He took great care of his troops, and they  were always ready to follow him. That is the man we want on the  musnud; not a young prince, of whom we can only say that he was  kindly.    \"And why did Nana choose you?\"    \"I am a second string to his bow. He sent off a messenger as soon  as he heard of Mahdoo Rao's accident but, fearing he might be  intercepted on the way, he has chosen me as being a person no one  would be likely to suspect of being his messenger, on so important  a matter.\"    \"It is important, indeed, Puntojee. There is no saying what may be  the result of the Peishwa's death. There is no doubt that Scindia  and Holkar will, for once, be in complete accord with Nana  Furnuwees, and will combine in any plan to keep Rugoba's son from  succeeding; still, there are many of the friends of Rugoba who will  be ready to declare for his son and, moreover, there are the  stories that have been so widely circulated as to Bajee's personal  appearance, and his many accomplishments--these will gain for him a  great number of partisans.\"    The journey was performed without interruption. At one time, a body  of some fifty horsemen made their appearance on rising ground near  the road, but drew off when they saw how strong was the party and,  after a ride of sixty miles, they arrived at Purseram Bhow's camp.  Harry dismounted in front of the general's tent and, entering,  handed him the letter.    \"What is your news?\" the latter asked, before opening it.    \"There is none, General, beyond what the letter, sent to you three  hours before I left, will have prepared you to hear. I only bear a  copy of that letter, in case the first should not have reached  you.\"    \"It is well that the precaution was taken for, in truth, the  messenger has not arrived.\"    \"It is possible that he may have been murdered on the way, sir; for  we saw a party of fifty horsemen on the road, whose intentions  seemed to be hostile, but as I had Sufder's troop of a hundred men  with me, they drew off.\"    \"But what is the news, then, that is so important that steps are  taken to stop messengers that bear it?\"    Harry related what had taken place, the old officer giving many  ejaculations of regret, and horror, at the news of Mahdoo Rao's  death.    \"'Tis a terrible misfortune, indeed,\" he said, \"and is like to  throw the whole country into disorder again.\"    He opened the despatch now, and glanced through it. He called some  of his officers, who were gathered near the tent, and ordered them  to cause the trumpets to be sounded for all the troops to be in  readiness to march, at once; leaving only a small body of infantry  to pack up the tents, and follow at a more leisurely pace with the  baggage.    An hour later two regiments of cavalry started, infantry men being  taken up behind the troopers and, late the next day, they arrived  at Poona. Scindia and the Rajah of Berar had also been sent for, in  haste and, as soon as they arrived, a council was held as to the  choice that should be made of a successor.    All were opposed to the selection of Bajee Rao; for he would have  been brought up by his mother, with the deepest enmity towards  those who had successfully combined against his father. It was  therefore proposed that the widow of Mahdoo Rao should adopt a son,  in whose name the government should be carried on.    It was not until two months had been spent in negotiations that the  matter was finally settled. One of Scindia's ministers, named  Balloba, alone opposed the course decided upon; and Bajee Rao  opened communications with him, and succeeded in winning him over  to his cause. Having done this he addressed Scindia; offering him a  very large addition to his territory, and payment of all his  expenses, if he would assist him to gain his rightful position. As  Balloba had great influence over the young Scindia, the offer was  accepted.    The arrangement was made so secretly that Nana Furnuwees had  received no intimation, whatever, of what was going on, until the  agreement had been concluded. Purseram Bhow was again summoned to  Poona and, with his usual energy, made a march of one hundred and  twenty miles in forty-eight hours.    The position was a difficult one, indeed. At one blow, the plans  that had been so carefully laid by Nana were shattered. Scindia,  who had but a month or two before formed one of the confederacy,  had now gone round to the side of Bajee Rao, who regarded the  minister as his greatest enemy. Holkar was not to be depended upon  and, in Poona, there were many adherents of the son of Rugoba. The  council held by Nana, Purseram, and two or three other great  officers was long and, at times, stormy; but it was finally agreed  that the sole way out of the perilous position, caused by Scindia's  desertion, was to anticipate him and to release Bajee Rao, and  declare him Peishwa.    Purseram started, at once, to the fort where the brothers were  confined. Harry, who was now deeply interested in the course of  events, was one of Nana's officers who accompanied Purseram. On  hearing the general's errand, the officer in command of the fort at  once sent for Bajee, his brother Chimnajee, and Amrud--who was the  adopted son of Rugoba, and who stood on an equal footing with  regard to the succession. Bajee Rao listened calmly to the  proposals made to him in Nana's name, asked several questions, and  demanded guarantees; but was evidently disposed to accept the  proposals, if assured that they were made in good faith.    Amrud strongly urged him to decline the offer; but Bajee, upon  Purseram taking the most solemn oath known to the Hindoos, in proof  of his sincerity, accepted the offer and, with his brother  Chimnajee, rode with Purseram to Poona; Amrud being left behind in  the fort, as Purseram considered that he would continue to exercise  his influence over Bajee in a direction hostile to Nana's interest.    As soon as the party arrived at the capital, an interview took  place between Bajee and Nana when, in the presence of many of the  great officers, both swore to forget all enmities and injuries, and  Bajee promised to retain Nana at the head of his administration.    That same evening, the minister sent for Harry.    \"Puntojee,\" he said, \"I have a commission for you. I know that you  are loyal to me, and that I can depend upon you. I wish you to go  at once to Scindia's camp, which is now on the bank of the  Godavery, and ascertain how he takes the news. Doubtless Balloba,  his prime minister, will be furious at finding that, instead of  Bajee becoming a mere creature of Scindia's, I have placed him on  the musnud, and retain my place as his chief minister. I can employ  you for this business better than most others, for the greater part  of my officers are personally known to those of Scindia, while you  have scarce been seen by them. I have also a high idea of your  shrewdness; and I have no doubt that you will, in some way, be able  to gain the information that I require--indeed, it will probably be  the public talk of the camp. If you should find an opportunity of  entering into negotiations, with any influential person in  Scindia's court, I authorize you to do so in my name; and to agree  to any reasonable demands that he may make, either for a payment in  money or in estates. Scindia's character is wholly unformed and,  though today he may be guided by Balloba, tomorrow he may lean on  someone else.    \"You can go in any guise you think fit, either as a trooper or as a  camp follower. In either case, you had better take Sufder and  twenty men with you; and leave them in concealment within a few  miles of the camp so that, in case of necessity, you can join them;  and his men can act as messengers, and bring your reports to me.\"    As it was now a year since Harry had first gone to Poona, and he  had during that time worked diligently, he could now both read and  write the Mahratta language, and was thus able to send in written  reports; instead of being obliged to "]]]
