Regarding the management of the Star of the West, as I have already  intimated, this Baha'i organ as well as other similar publications, far  from being regarded as the special organ of a certain group or particular  locality, should fall under the exclusive control of the National  Spiritual Assembly, which, aided by a special committee, shall minutely  guide and judiciously scrutinize all the information it gives, the  character of the articles and translations it publishes, and the tone and  language it assumes in all its issues....          Reports of Activities      I shall always await from the members of the National Spiritual Assembly,  collective, official and comprehensive reports on their manifold  activities, sent to me at frequent intervals, and bearing upon the inner  and outward currents of the Movement, the relations of Assemblies to one  another, and the general standing and the various aspects of the progress  of the Cause throughout the land. I would welcome more specific reports  sent to me by the various committees of the National Spiritual Assembly,  enclosed in the National Assembly's letter, and approved by all its  members.          Mashriqu'l-Adhkar      I have read with keen interest all the enclosures regarding the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, have shared the up-to-date news they contained with  the friends throughout the East, and note with particular pleasure the  completion of the Basement Section, with its spacious Foundation Hall  ready for the holding of meetings and the gatherings of friends. Though  the prospect of the immediate resumption of building activity does not  seem bright at present, yet I hope and pray that these difficulties will  soon disappear, and the work of this unique Edifice, stimulated and  advanced in time by the zeal and self-sacrifice of the friends the world  over, will soon attain its glorious consummation. I beg to enclose my  humble contribution of 19 pounds, as my share of the numerous donations  that have reached the Temple Treasury in the past year.    Pray convey to the members of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar Committee the  highest sense of my appreciation for their devoted and strenuous labors,  and my constant prayers for the success of the task which they have set  themselves to accomplish.    With regard to the situation in Persia, and the condition of the friends  in that land, I have requested the Tihran Spiritual Assembly to send me  immediately an authoritative and full report of the exact situation,  whereupon I shall duly inform you of the exact steps to be taken to insure  the well-being and safety of the tried believers in Persia....    The holding of State Congresses, Amity Conventions, and other universal  associations of the friends in America, will naturally fall within the  province of the National Spiritual Assembly, which will direct and  supervise the work of them all by the aid of special committees, each  constituted for a specific purpose. The matter of receiving Orientals is  left entirely in the hands of the National Spiritual Assembly, whose  special committee for this purpose will have to investigate all the  questions arising in this connection in future. Please convey to the  members of the newly constituted Library Committee my deep appreciation of  their labors in this important field of service, and assure them of my  prayers for their success.    Touching the point raised in the Secretary's letter regarding the nature  and scope of the Universal Court of Arbitration, this and other similar  matters will have to be explained and elucidated by the Universal House of  Justice, to which, according to the Master's explicit instructions, all  important and fundamental questions must be referred. At present the exact  implication and full significance of the provisions of the Master's Will  are as yet imperfectly understood, and time will serve to reveal the  wisdom and the far-reaching effects of His words.    I am enclosing on a separate sheet the full authoritative code, widely  adopted by contemporary Orientalists throughout the world, which will  serve as a basis for the transliteration of Baha'i terms and Oriental  names.(7)    Remembering you all in my hours of visit and prayer at the Three Holy  Shrines, and wishing you success from all my heart,    I am your brother and fellow-worker,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine.  April 9th, 1923.          Letter of April 27th, 1923.      To the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.    Beloved fellow-workers in the Cause:    I am not sure whether I have sent you before a copy of this glorious  Tablet revealed by Baha'u'llah for His beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha, written in  His own blessed handwriting, and which we found among his papers and  documents soon after the Master's Ascension. It reveals in terms of  touching tenderness the unique station of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and constitutes an  unchallengeable evidence of His supreme authority.    I am also enclosing my rendering of various passages of the  Kitab-i-Aqdas(8) which you may feel at liberty to circulate amongst the  friends.    Wishing you all success in your work,    I am your devoted brother,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  April 27th, 1923.          Letter of May 6th, 1923      To the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.    My friends and fellow-workers in the Cause of God!    Your most welcome message, imparting the glad news of a successful  Convention, has rejoiced my heart and fortified my hope in this year of  active service, that has just unfolded itself before you.    I am certain that, as the newly elected representatives of the Baha'i  Community throughout America, you are, one and all, well aware of your  mighty responsibilities, and fully realize the tremendous need for a full  understanding amongst the friends, and their active and sustained  cooperation in spreading far and wide the Cause of Baha'u'llah throughout  that vast continent.    I fervently hope that in collaboration with our wise, able and devoted  brother, Jinab-i-Fadil, you will inaugurate a brilliant and vigorous  campaign of Teaching, that shall by its very splendor banish the darkness  of differences and contention that so impede the majestic and onward march  of the Cause in every land.          Central Fund      That you may reinforce this Teaching Campaign--so vitally needed in these  days--and conduct, properly and efficiently, the rest of your manifold  activities, spiritual as well as humanitarian, it is urgently necessary to  establish that Central Fund, which if generously supported and upheld by  individual friends and local Assemblies, will soon enable you to execute  your plans with promptness and vigor.    It is my earnest prayer, in the day-time and in the night season, that the  ever-guiding Hand of our loved and departed Master may graciously aid you  to surmount every obstacle, and will lead, through you,--His chosen ones in  that land,--the Ark of His Cause, to its promised haven of glory and  triumph.    With heartfelt congratulations and best wishes,    I am your brother and fellow-worker,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine.  May 6th, 1923.    P.S. I enclose a copy of my translation(9) of Baha'u'llah's Words of  Wisdom, which you will feel at liberty to circulate amongst the friends.          Letter of November 14, 1923.      To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout  America, care of the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.    Fellow-laborers in the Divine Vineyard:    Upon my return, after a forced and prolonged absence, to the Holy Land, it  is my first and most ardent wish to renew and strengthen those ties of  brotherly love and fellowship that bind our hearts together in our common  servitude to His sacred Threshold.    The two years that have elapsed since the passing of our beloved Master  have been for the Cause, as well as for mankind, years of deep anxiety and  pain. The momentous changes that are taking place in the history of both  have proved so swift and far-reaching as to arouse in certain hearts a  strange misgiving as to their stability and future.    On one hand the remarkable revelations of the Beloved's Will and  Testament, so amazing in all its aspects, so emphatic in its injunctions,  have challenged and perplexed the keenest minds, whilst the  ever-increasing confusion of the world, threatened as never before with  disruptive forces, fierce rivalries, fresh commotions and grave disorder,  has well-nigh overwhelmed the heart and damped the zeal of even the most  enthusiastic believer in the destiny of mankind.    And yet, how often we seem to forget the clear and repeated warnings of  our beloved Master, who, in particular during the concluding years of His  mission on earth, laid stress on the \"severe mental tests\" that would  inevitably sweep over His loved ones of the West--tests that would purge,  purify and prepare them for their noble mission in life.          The Cause of Human Suffering      And as to the world's evil plight, we need but recall the writings and  sayings of Baha'u'llah, who, more than fifty years ago, declared in terms  prophetic the prime cause of the ills and sufferings of mankind, and set  forth their true and divine remedy. \"Should the Lamp of Religion be  hidden,\" He declares, \"Chaos and confusion will ensue.\" How admirably  fitting and applicable are these words to the present state of mankind!    Ours is then the duty and privilege to labor, by day and by night, amidst  the storm and stress of these troublous days, that we may quicken the zeal  of our fellow-men, rekindle their hopes, stimulate their interest, open  their eyes to the true Faith of God and enlist their active support in the  carrying out of our common task for the peace and regeneration of the  world.    Let us take heart and be thankful to our beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha, as we  remember His manifold blessings and unfailing care and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19254"],[0,"Citadel of Faith (#11)"],[1,"storms which may buffet it in the days  to come in either hemisphere, however sweeping the changes which the  impact of cataclysmic forces from without, and the stirrings of a Divine  embryonic Order from within, will effect in its structure and life, we  may, confident in the words uttered by 'Abdu'l-Baha, feel assured that  that great republic--the shell that enshrines so precious a member of the  world community of the followers of His Father--will continue to evolve,  undivided and undefeatable, until the sum total of its contributions to  the birth, the rise and the fruition of that world civilization, the child  of the Most Great Peace and hallmark of the Golden Age of the Dispensation  of Baha'u'llah, will have been made, and its last task discharged.    [June 5, 1947]            EUROPEAN PIONEERS AND TEMPLE CONTRACT      Rejoice at evidences of continued vigorous activity. Renew plea to  believers possessing independent means to volunteer for European pioneer  field, both settlers and itinerant teachers. Eagerly awaiting response to  Convention message. Praying for placing of Temple contract before  termination of current year. Ardently supplicating unprecedented blessings  for manifold, meritorious, magnificent services. Deepest love.    [July 13, 1947]            EVIDENCES OF NOTABLE EXPANSION      Greatly welcome evidences of a notable expansion of activities and  increased intensification of efforts for publicity. I urge believers and  local assemblies to redouble their efforts in support of vital National  Fund. Praying ardently for realization of your highest hopes. Appreciate  action for preservation of Keith's grave. Do not advise you to transmit  further funds to Persia for the grave. I appeal to North American  believers to exert their utmost to insure the formation of required number  of assemblies by next April. Further sacrifices demanded, rich reward  assured. May entire body of American believers arise to fulfill their  glorious destiny.    Abiding gratitude, deepest love.    [September 10, 1947]            EFFECTIVE PROSECUTION OF SACRED TASKS      The steadily deepening crisis which mankind is traversing, on the morrow  of the severest ordeal it has yet suffered, and the attendant tribulations  and commotions which a travailing age must necessarily experience, as a  prelude to the birth of the new World Order, destined to rise upon the  ruins of a tottering civilization, must, as they intensify, increasingly  influence the course, and, in some cases, retard the progress, of the  collective enterprises successively launched in the opening years of the  second Baha'i century, and in almost every continent of the globe, by the  world-wide community of the organized followers of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah. In the land of its birth long-standing political rivalries,  combined with a steady decline in the authority and influence exercised by  the central government, are contributing to the reemergence of reactionary  forces, represented by an as yet influential and fanatical priesthood, to  a recrudescence of the persecution, and a multiplication of the  disabilities, to which a still unemancipated Faith has been so cruelly  subjected for more than a century. In the heart of the continent of  Europe, still fiercer political rivalries, as well as the clash of  conflicting ideologies, have prevented the unification, indefinitely  retarded the national revival, multiplied the vicissitudes and rendered  more desperate the plight, of a nation comprising within its frontiers the  largest community of the adherents of the Faith on that continent--a  community destined, as prophesied by 'Abdu'l-Baha, to play a major role in  the spiritual awakening and the ultimate conversion of the European  peoples and races to His Father's Faith. In the subcontinent of India  recent political developments of a momentous character have plunged its  divers castes, races and denominations into grave turmoil, brought in  their wake riots, bloodshed, misery and confusion, fanned into flame  religious animosities, and well-nigh disrupted its economic life. In the  Nile Valley the outbreak of a widespread and virulent epidemic, following  closely upon the political unrest and the severe economic crisis already  afflicting its inhabitants, threatens to disorganize the life of the  nation and to bring in its wake afflictions of an even more serious  character. In the Holy Land itself, the heart and nerve-center of the  far-flung and firmly knit community of the followers of Baha'u'llah, and  the repository of its holiest shrines, already gravely disturbed by the  chronic instability of its political life, the religious dissensions of  its inhabitants, and the ten-year-long strain and danger to which its  people have been subjected and exposed, fresh perils are looming on its  horizon, menacing it, on the one hand with the ravages of an epidemic that  has already taken so heavy a toll of the lives of the people beyond its  southern frontier, and threatening it, on the other, with a civil war of  extreme severity and unpredictable in its consequences. Subject to the  same fundamental causes which have deranged the equilibrium of present-day  society and corroded its life are to be regarded the privations, the  restrictions and crisis which, to a lesser degree, are oppressing the  peoples of Central and Southeastern Europe, of the British Isles and of  certain republics of Central and South America.    In all these territories, whether in the Eastern or Western Hemisphere,  the nascent institutions of a struggling Faith, though subjected in  varying degrees to the stress and strain associated with the decline and  dissolution of time-honored institutions, with fratricidal strife,  economic upheavals, financial crises, outbreaks of epidemics and political  revolutions, have thus far, through the interpositions of a merciful  Providence, been graciously enabled to follow their charted course,  undeflected by the cross-currents and the tempestuous winds which must of  necessity increasingly agitate human society ere the hour of its ultimate  redemption approaches.    In contrast to these sorely tried countries on the European, the Asiatic  and the African continents, unlike her sister republics in either Central  or South America, the great republic of the West--the homeland of that  mother community which, fostered through the tender care of an  ever-solicitous Master, has already proved itself capable of rearing in  its turn such splendid progeny among the divers communities of Latin  America, which bids fair to multiply its daughter communities in a  continent of mightier potentialities--such a republic has been, to a  peculiar degree and over a long and uninterrupted period, relatively free  from the chronic disorders, the political disturbances, the economic  convulsions, the communal riots, the epidemics, the religious  persecutions, the privations and loss of life which, during successive  generations, have in one way or another afflicted so many peoples in  almost every part of the globe.    Singled out by the Almighty for such a unique measure of favor, suffered  to evolve, untrammelled and unperturbed, within the shell of its God-given  Administrative Order, distinguished from its sister communities through  the revelation of a Plan emanating directly from the mind and pen of its  Founder, enriched already by so many trophies, each an eloquent testimony  to its missionary zeal and valor in distant fields and amidst divers  peoples, the Community of the Most Great Name in the North American  continent must, sensible of the abounding grace vouchsafed to it by  Baha'u'llah, resolve, as it has never resolved before, to carry out,  however much it may be buffeted by future circumstances and the unforeseen  ordeals which a heedless and chaotic world may still further experience,  the mission confidently entrusted to its hands by an all-wise and loving  Master.          HEART-WARMING PROGRESS IN EUROPEAN ENTERPRISE      Already in the newly opened European field, where the first stage of its  transatlantic missionary enterprise is now unfolding, the success which  the vanguard of its army of pioneers has already achieved in several  leading capitals of that continent is truly heart-warming and evokes  intense admiration. The broad outlines of the primary institutions  heralding the erection of the administrative framework of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah in no less than ten sovereign states of Europe can already be  discerned--a powerful and signal reinforcement of the organized and  progressive efforts exerted by the British and German communities on the  northwestern limits of that continent and in its very heart. In the Latin  American field, where the structural basis of a rising Administrative  Order has already been established, through the formation of firmly  grounded assemblies in each of the republics of Central and South America,  the stage is being set for the erection of those institutions which are to  be regarded as the harbingers of the secondary Houses of Justice which, in  each of these republics, must act as pillars, and assist in sustaining the  weight, of the final unit designed to consummate the institutions of that  order. On the northern portion of that same hemisphere the stage is  already set for the impending emergence of an institution which, however  circumscribed its basis, must ultimately, directly participate in the  measures preliminary to the constitution of the Universal House of  Justice.    A community now in the process of marshalling and directing, in such vast  territories, in such outlying regions, amidst such a diversity of peoples,  at so precarious a stage in the fortunes of mankind, forces of such  incalculable potency, to serve purposes so meritorious and lofty, cannot  afford to falter for a moment or retrace its steps on the path it now  travels. Its commitments, so vast, so"]]]
