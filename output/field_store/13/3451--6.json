[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22925"],[0,"The Story of Young Abraham Lincoln (#11)"],[1,"now reminds me of a fix I got into some thirty years  ago when I was peddling 'notions' on the way from Indiana to Illinois. I  didn't have a large stock, but I charged large prices and I made money.  Perhaps you don't see what I am driving at.    \"Just before we left Indiana and were crossing into Illinois we came  across a small farmhouse full of children. These ranged in age from  seventeen years to seventeen months, and were all in tears. The mother  of the family was red-headed and red-faced, and the whip she held in her  right hand led to the inference that she had been chastising her brood.  The father of the family, a meek-looking, mild-mannered, tow-headed  chap, was standing at the front door--to all appearances waiting his  turn!    \"I thought there wasn't much use in asking the head of that house if she  wanted any 'notions.' She was too busy. It was evident that an  insurrection had been in progress, but it was pretty well quelled when I  got there. She saw me when I came up, and from her look I thought she  surmised that I intended to interfere. Advancing to the doorway--roughly  pushing her husband aside--she demanded my business.    \"'Nothing, ma'am,' I answered as gently as possible. 'I merely dropped  in, as I came along, to see how things were going.'    \"'Well, you needn't wait,' she said in an irritated way; 'there's  trouble here, and lots of it, too, but I kin manage my own affairs  without the help of outsiders. This is jest a family row, but I'll teach  these brats their places if I hev to lick the hide off every one of  them. I don't do much talking, but I run this house, an' I don't want no  one sneakin' round tryin' to find out how I do it either.'    \"That's the case here with us. We must let the other nations know that  we propose to settle our family row in our own way, an' teach these  brats (the seceding States) their places, and, like the old woman, we  don't want any 'sneakin' round' by other countries, that would like to  find out how we are going to do it either.\"      \"WINNING A DOG'S GRATITUDE\"    Abe strode along in the mud, driving the four oxen much of the time,  for the houses he could visit with his peddler's pack were few and far  between. A dog belonging to one of the family--an insignificant little  cur--fell behind. After the oxen had floundered through the mud, snow  and ice of a prairie stream, they discovered that the animal was  missing. The other men of the party thought they could now get rid of  the little nuisance, and even the women were anxious, as the hour was  late, to go on and find a place to camp for the night. To turn back with  the clumsy ox-team and lumbering emigrant wagon was out of the question.    Abraham gave the whip to one of the other men and turned back to see if  he could discern the dog anywhere. He discovered it running up and down  on the other bank of the river, in great distress, for the swift current  was filled with floating ice and the poor little creature was afraid to  make the attempt to swim across. After whistling in vain to encourage  the dog to try if it would, the tender-hearted youth went to its rescue.  Referring to the incident himself afterward, he said:    \"I could not endure the idea of abandoning even a dog. Pulling off shoes  and socks, I waded across the stream and triumphantly returned with the  shivering animal under my arm. His frantic leaps of joy and other  evidences of a dog's gratitude amply repaid me for all the exposure I  had undergone.\"      SPLITTING THE HISTORIC RAILS    After two weary weeks of floundering through muddy prairies and jolting  over rough forest roads, now and then fording swollen and dangerous  streams, the Lincolns were met near Decatur, Illinois, by Cousin John  Hanks, and given a hearty welcome. John had chosen a spot not far from  his own home, and had the logs all ready to build a cabin for the  newcomers. Besides young Abe, with the strength of three, there were  five men in the party, so they were able to erect their first home in  Illinois without asking the help of the neighbors, as was customary for  a \"raising\" of that kind.    Nicolay and Hay, President Lincoln's private secretaries, in their great  life of their chief, gave the following account of the splitting of the  rails which afterward became the talk of the civilized world:    \"Without the assistance of John Hanks he plowed fifteen acres, and  split, from the tall walnut trees of the primeval forest, enough rails  to surround them with a fence. Little did either dream, while engaged in  this work, that the day would come when the appearance of John Hanks in  a public meeting with two of these rails on his shoulder, would  electrify a State convention, and kindle throughout the country a  contagious and passionate enthusiasm whose results would reach to  endless generations.\"          CHAPTER IX    STARTING OUT FOR HIMSELF      HIS FATHER AND HIS \"FREEDOM SUIT\"    According to his own account, Abe had made about thirty dollars as a  peddler, besides bearing the brunt of the labor of the journey, though  there were four grown men in the combined family. As he had passed his  twenty-first birthday on the road, he really had the right to claim  these profits as his own. His father, who had, for ten years, exacted  Abraham's meager, hard-earned wages, should at least have given the boy  a part of that thirty dollars for a \"freedom suit\" of clothes, as was  the custom then.    But neither Thomas Lincoln nor his son seems to have thought of such a  thing. Instead of entertaining resentment, Abraham stayed by, doing all  he could to make his father and stepmother comfortable before he left  them altogether. Mrs. Lincoln had two daughters and sons-in-law, besides  John Johnston, so Abe might easily have excused himself from looking  after the welfare of his parents. Though his father had seemed to favor  his stepchildren in preference to his own son, Mrs. Lincoln had been  \"like an own mother to him,\" and he never ceased to show his gratitude  by being \"like an own son to her.\"    The first work Abe did in that neighborhood was to split a thousand  rails for a pair of trousers, at the rate of four hundred rails per yard  of \"brown jeans dyed with walnut bark.\" The young man's breeches cost  him about four hundred rails more than they would if he had been a man  of ordinary height.    But Abraham hovered about, helping clear a little farm, and making the  cabin comfortable while he was earning his own \"freedom suit.\" He saw  the spring planting done and that a garden was made for his stepmother  before he went out of ready reach of the old people.    One special reason Thomas Lincoln had for leaving Indiana was to get  away from \"the milksick.\" But the fall of 1830 was a very bad season in  Illinois for chills and fever. The father and, in fact, nearly the whole  family left at home suffered so much from malaria that they were  thoroughly discouraged. The interior of their little cabin was a sorry  sight--Thomas and his wife were both afflicted at once, and one married  daughter was almost as ill. They were all so sick that Thomas Lincoln  registered a shaky but vehement resolve that as soon as they could  travel they would \"git out o' thar!\" He had been so determined to move  to Illinois that no persuasion could induce him to give up the project,  therefore his disappointment was the more keen and bitter.    The first winter the Lincolns spent in Illinois was memorable for its  severity. It is still spoken of in that region as \"the winter of the big  snow.\" Cattle and sheep froze to death or died of exposure and  starvation.      BUILDING THE FLATBOAT    Early in the spring after \"the big snow,\" John Hanks, Lincoln and John  Johnston met Denton Offutt, a man who was to wield an influence on the  life of young Lincoln. Offutt engaged the three to take a load of  produce and other merchandise to New Orleans to sell. John Hanks, the  most reliable member of the Hanks family, gave the following account of  the way he managed to bring Abe and his stepbrother into the  transaction: \"He wanted me to go badly but I waited before answering. I  hunted up Abe, and I introduced him and John Johnston, his stepbrother,  to Offutt. After some talk we at last made an engagement with Offutt at  fifty cents a day and sixty dollars to make the trip to New Orleans. Abe  and I came down the Sangamon River in a canoe in March, 1831, and landed  at what is now called Jamestown, five miles east of Springfield.\"    Denton Offutt spent so much time drinking in a tavern at the village of  Springfield that the flatboat was not ready when the trio arrived to  take it and its cargo down the river. Their employer met them on their  arrival with profuse apologies, and the three men were engaged to build  the boat and load it up for the journey.    During the four weeks required to build the raft, the men of that  neighborhood became acquainted with young Lincoln. A man named John Roll  has given this description of Abe's appearance at that time:    \"He was a tall, gaunt young man, dressed in a suit of blue homespun,  consisting of a roundabout jacket, waistcoat, and breeches which came to  within about three inches of his feet. The latter were encased in  rawhide boots, into the tops of which, most of the time, his pantaloons  were stuffed. He wore a soft felt hat which had once been black, but  now, as its owner dryly remarked, 'was sunburned until it was a combine  of colors.'\"    There was a sawmill in Sangamontown, and it was the custom for the \"men  folks\" of the neighborhood to assemble near it at noon and in the  evening, and sit on a peeled log which had been rolled out for the  purpose. Young Lincoln soon joined this group and at once became a great  favorite because of his stories and jokes. His stories were so funny  that \"whenever he'd end 'em up in his unexpected way the boys on the log  would whoop and roll off.\" In this way the log"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#11)"],[1,"bolt upright on top of the sled, and he gave his short  double bark as I drew near to make me notice that he was still doing his  duty although under difficulties. The dog had climbed up a wood-pile and  had jumped to the top of the outhouse and so to the sled. I thought of  Kipling's _Men That Fought at Minden_:            \"For fatigue it was their pride           And they would _not_ be denied           To clean the cook-house floor.\"    Here at Coldfoot we came first into contact with that interesting tribe  of wandering inland Esquimaux known as the Kobuks, from their occupation  of the river of that name. The Koyukuk has its own Indian people, but  these enterprising Kobuks have pushed their way farther and farther from  salt water into what used to be exclusive Indian territory.  Representatives of both races were at Coldfoot, and as we lay  weather-bound for a couple of days, I was enabled to renew last year's  acquaintance with them, though without a good interpreter not much  progress was made. The delight of these people at the road-house  phonograph, the first they had ever heard, was some compensation for the  incessant snarl and scream of the instrument itself. It was very funny  to see them sitting on the floor, roaring with laughter at one  particularly silly spoken record of the \"Uncle Josh at the World's Fair\"  order. Over and over again they would ask for that record, and it never  ceased to convulse them with laughter. \"He's been enjoyin' poor health  lately, but this mornin' I heard him complain that he felt a little  better\"--how sick and tired we got of this and similar jokes drawled out  a dozen times running! The natives did not understand a word of it; it  was the human voice with its pronounced, unusual inflections that  aroused their merriment. The phonograph is becoming a powerful agency  for disseminating a knowledge of English amongst the natives throughout  Alaska, and one wishes that it were put to better use than the  reproduction of silly and often vulgar monologue and dialogue and trashy  ragtime music. As an index of the taste of those who purchase records,  the selection brought to this country points low.    The third day the thermometer stood at -49 deg. and we were free to leave  without actually breaking the rule we had made after the escapade on the  Yukon. Two other teams were going down the river, so we started with  them on the sixty-five mile journey to Bettles. Twenty miles or so below  Coldfoot the Koyukuk passes for several miles in a narrow channel  between steep rock bluffs, with here and there great detached masses  standing in the middle of the river. One has a grotesque resemblance to  an aged bishop in his vestments and is known as the Bishop Rock; another  a more remote likeness to an Indian woman, and this is known as the  Squaw Rock. This part of the river, which is called the canon of the  Koyukuk, though it is not a true canon, is very picturesque, and because  of frequent overflow, offers glare ice and swift passage to the  traveller when it does not embarrass him with running water. We were  fortunate enough to pass it without getting our dogs' feet wet, and made  the half-way road-house in a brilliant moon that rendered travelling at  night pleasanter than during the day.    [Sidenote: TRAVELLING AT \"50 BELOW\"]    The next day we started again at near 50 deg. below, but because there was a  good trail and a road-house for noon, the travelling was rather pleasant  than otherwise. If there be a warm house to break the day's march and  eat in, where ice-incrusted scarfs and parkees and caps and mittens may  be dried out, with a warm outhouse where the dogs may rest in comfort,  travelling in such weather is not too risky or too severely trying. The  continual condensation of the moisture from the breath upon everything  about the head and face is a decided inconvenience, and when it  condenses upon the eye-lashes, and the upper and the lower lashes freeze  together, the ice must be removed or it is impossible to open the eyes.  This requires the momentary application of the bare hand, and every time  it goes back into the mitten it carries some moisture with it, so that  after a while mittens are wet as well as head-gear; moreover, there is  always a certain perspiration that condenses. One gets into the habit of  turning the duffel lining of the moose-hide mitts inside out and hanging  them up the moment one gets inside a cabin. Round every road-house stove  there is a rack constructed for just that purpose.    There is no more striking phenomenon of the arctic trail than the  behaviour of smoke in cold weather. As one approaches a road-house, and  to greater degree a village or a town, it is seen enveloped in mist,  although there be no open water to account for it, and the prospect in  every other direction be brilliantly clear. It is not mist at all; it is  merely the smoke from the stovepipes. And the explanation is simple,  although not all at once arrived at. Smoke rises because it is warmer  than the air into which it is discharged; for that and no other reason.  Now, when smoke is discharged into air at a temperature of 50 deg. below  zero, it is deprived of its heat immediately and falls to the ground by  its greater specific gravity. The smoke may be observed just issuing  from the pipe, or rising but a few feet, and then curling downward to be  diffused amidst the air near the ground.    It was to such a smoke-enveloped inn that we pulled up to warm and  refresh ourselves and our team for the twenty miles that remained of the  day's march. We had almost reached the limit of Koyukuk road-houses.  Bettles being the head of navigation, and merchandise late in the season  finding water too shallow for transport to the diggings, there is more  or less freighting with dog teams and horses all the winter. This travel  keeps open the road-houses on the route. From an \"outside\" point of view  they may appear rough and the fare coarse. The night accommodation is a  double row of bunks on each side of a long room with a great stove in  the middle. Sometimes there is straw in the bunks, sometimes spruce  boughs; in the better class even sometimes hay-stuffed mattresses. But  to the weary traveller, who has battled with the storm or endured the  intense cold for hours at a stretch, they are glad havens of refuge;  they are often even life-saving stations.    [Sidenote: METEOROLOGICAL]    While we lay at the road-house the clear sky clouded and the thermometer  rose. This is an unfailing sequence. Clear, bright weather is cold  weather; cloudy weather is warm weather. The usual explanation, that the  cloud acts as a blanket that checks the radiation of heat from the  earth, is one of those explanations that do not explain. There is no  heat to radiate. The cloud is a mass of moist air, which is warm air,  introducing itself from some milder region. So the cloud brings the  heat; and the lower layers of atmosphere extract it and thereby  discharge the moisture. For an hour or two around noon the thermometer  stood at -35 deg. and there was a light fall of snow; then the skies cleared  because they were discharged of all their moisture, and the thermometer  went down to -50 deg. again. It is a beautifully simple process and  sometimes takes place two or three times a day. Every time the sky  clouds, the thermometer rises; every time the sky clears, the  thermometer falls. And because the barometer gives notice of changes in  the density of the atmosphere, it is valuable in forecasting temperature  in our winters. A steady rise in the barometer means a steady fall in  the thermometer; a fall in the barometer in a time of great cold  infallibly prophesies warmer weather; even such rapid changes as the one  given above are anticipated. So well is this established, that during  \"50 deg.-below spells\" at Fairbanks, impatient, weather-bound travellers and  freighters would busy the hospital telephone with inquiries about the  barometer, the hospital having the only barometer in the country.    After another long, cold run, on the night of Friday, the 12th of  January, we reached Bettles, the place we had planned to spend Christmas  at. We were unable to stir from Bettles for two solid weeks, for during  the whole of that time the thermometer never rose above 50 deg. below zero.    The long wait at Bettles would have been excessively tedious had it not  been for the kind hospitality of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Grimm, the  Commercial Company's agent and his wife, and this is but one of many  times that I have been under obligation to them for cordial welcome and  entertainment, for needs anticipated, and every sort of assistance  gladly rendered. We had been expected many days; the Christmas  festivities with a gathering of natives of both races had come and gone;  still they looked for us, for in this country one does not give a man up  merely because he is a few weeks behind time, nor hold him to account  for unpunctuality. The natives remained for the most part, and there was  abundant opportunity of intercourse with them and some beginnings of  instruction. As the days passed and all arrangements for our advance  were made, we chafed more and more at the delay, for it was very plain  that the prospect of visiting Point Hope grew less and less; but this is  a great country for teaching patience and resignation.    [Sidenote: PARASELENAE]    Some of the weather during that two weeks' wait was of quite exceptional  severity. One night is fixed for ever in my memory. It is a very rare  thing for the wind to blow in the \"strong cold,\" but that night there  was a wind at 58 deg. below zero. And high up in the heavens was a sight I  had never seen before. The moon, little past her full, had a great ring  around her, faintly prismatic; and equidistant from her, where a line  through her centre parallel with the horizon would cut the ring, were  two other moons,"]]]
