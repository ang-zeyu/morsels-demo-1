Mis' Winslow gasped, in the immemorial belief that the physical basis of  motherhood is the guarantee of both spiritual and physical equipment.    \"Could you have cut out that coat?\" Mary asked.    Mis' Winslow shook her head. She was of those whose genius is for  cutting over.    \"Well,\" said Mary, \"I could. It ain't having 'em that teaches you to do  for 'em. You either know how, or you don't know how. That's all.\"    Mis' Winslow reflected that she could never make Mary understand--though  any mother, she thought complacently, would know in a minute. The  cutting of the coat did give her pause; but then, she summed it up,  coat included, \"Mary was queer\"--and let it go at that.    \"I didn't know,\" Mis' Winslow said then, \"but what I could help you some  about the little boy's coming. Seven-under-fifteen does teach you  something, you've got to allow. Mebbe I could tell you something, now  and then. Or if we could do anything to help you get ready for him....\"    \"Oh,\" said Mary, in swift penitence, \"thank you, Mis' Winslow. After he  comes, maybe. But these things now I don't mind doing. The real  nuisance'll come afterwards, I s'pose.\"    Mis' Winslow smiled in soft triumph.    \"_Nuisance!_\" she said. \"That's what I meant comes to you by having 'em.  You don't think so much of the nuisance part as you did before.\"    \"Then you don't look the thing in the face,\" said Mary, calmly. \"That's  all about that.\"    \"Well,\" Mis' Winslow said pacifically, \"when's he coming?\"    \"A week from Tuesday. A week from to-morrow,\" Mary told her.    Mis' Winslow looked at her intently, with the light of calculation in  her narrowed eyes.    \"A week from Tuesday,\" she said. \"A week from Tuesday,\" she repeated.  \"_A week from Tuesday!_\" she exclaimed. \"Why, Mary Chavah. That's  Christmas Eve.\"    It was some matter of recipes that was absorbing Mis' Bates and Mis'  Moran when Mis' Winslow breathlessly returned to them. They were deep in  tradition, and in method, its buttonhole relation. During the weary  period when nutrition has been one of the two great problems the  tremendous impulse that has nourished the world was alive in the faces  of the two women, a kind of creative fire, such as had burned in Mary at  the cutting of her pattern. Asparagus escalloped with toast crumbs and  butter was for the moment symbol of all humanity's will to keep alive.    \"Ladies,\" said Mis' Winslow, with no other preface, \"what do you think?  Mary Chavah's little boy is coming from Idaho with a tag on, and when do  you s'pose he's going to get here? Christmas Eve.\"    \"Christmas Eve,\" repeated Mis' Bates, whose mind never lightly forsook  old ways or embraced a contretemps; \"what a funny time to travel.\"    \"Likely catch the croup and be down sick on Mary's hands the first  thing,\" said Mis' Moran. \"It's a pity it ain't the Spring of the year.\"    Mis' Winslow looked at them searchingly to see if her thought too far  outdistanced theirs.    \"What struck me all of a heap,\" she said, \"is his getting here then.  _That_ night. Christmas Eve.\"    The three woman looked at one another.    \"That's so,\" Mis' Moran said.    \"Him--that child,\" Mis' Winslow put it, \"getting here Christmas Eve,  used to Christmas all his life, ten to one knowing in his head what he  hopes he'll get. And no Christmas. And him with no mother. And her only  a month or so dead.\"    \"Well,\" said Mis' Mortimer Bates, \"it's too bad it's happened so. But it  has happened so. You have to say that to your life quite often, I  notice. I don't know anything to do but to say it now.\"    Mis' Winslow had not taken off her cloak. She sat on the edge of her  chair, with her hands deep in its pockets, her black knit \"fascinator\"  fallen back from her hair. She was looking down at her cloth overshoes,  and she went on speaking as if she had hardly heard what Mis' Bates had  interposed.    \"He'll get in on the express,\" she said; \"Mary said so. She don't have  to go to the City to meet him. The man he travels with is going to put  him on the train in the City. The little fellow'll get here after dark.  After dark on Christmas Eve.\"    \"And no time for anybody to warn him that there won't be any Christmas  waiting for him,\" Mis' Moran observed thoughtfully.    \"And like enough he'll bring a little something for Mary for a present,\"  Mis' Winslow went on. \"How'll she feel _then_?\"    \"Ain't it too bad it ain't last year?\" Mis' Moran mourned. \"Everything  comes too late or too soon or not at all or else too much so, 'seems  though.\"    Mis' Bates's impulse to nonconformity had not prevented her forehead  from being drawn in their common sympathy; but it was a sympathy that  saw no practical way out and existed tamely as a high window and not as  a wide door.    \"Well,\" she said, \"Mary ain't exactly the one to see it so. You'll never  get her to feel bad about anybody not having a Christmas. I donno, if it  was any other year, as she'd be planning any different.\"    \"No,\" said Mis' Winslow, thoughtfully, \"Mary won't do anything. But we  could.\"    Mis' Bates's forehead took alarm--the alarm of the sympathetic hearer  who is challenged to be doer.    \"_Do?_\" she repeated. \"You can't go back on the paper at this late day.  And you can't give him a Christmas and every other of our children not  have any just because we're their parents and still living. There ain't  a thing to do.\"    Mis' Winslow's eyes were still on her overshoes. \"I don't believe  there's _never_ 'not a thing' to do,\" she said, \"I don't believe it.\"    Mis' Bates looked scandalized. \"That's nonsense,\" she said sharply, \"and  it's sacrilegious besides. When God means a thing to happen, there's not  a thing to do. What about earthquakes and--and cancers?\"    \"I don't believe he ever means earthquakes and cancers,\" said Mis'  Winslow, to her overshoes.    \"Prevent 'em, then!\" challenged Mis' Bates, triumphantly.    Mis' Winslow looked up. Her eyes were shining as they had shone  sometimes when one of her seven-under-fifteen had given its first sign  of consciousness of more than self.    \"I believe we'll do it some day,\" she said. \"I believe there's more to  us than we've got any idea of. I believe there's so much to us that one  of us that found out about it and told the rest would get hounded out of  town. But even now, I bet there's enough to us to do something every  time--something every time, no matter what. And I believe there's  something we can do about this little orphaned boy's Christmas, if we  nip our brains on to it in the right place.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" said Mis' Moran, \"sometimes when I think about Christmas I  almost wish we almost hadn't done the way we're going to do.\"    Mis' Bates stiffened.    \"Jane Moran,\" she said, \"do you think it's right to go head over heels  in debt to celebrate the birth of our Lord?\"    \"No,\" said Mis' Moran, \"I don't. But--\"    \"And you know nobody in Old Trail Town could afford any extravagance  this year?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mis' Moran, \"I do. Still--\"    \"And if part could and part couldn't, that makes it all the worse, don't  it?\"    \"I know,\" said Mis' Moran, \"I know.\"    \"Well, then,\" said Mis' Bates triumphantly, \"we've done the only way  there is to do. Land knows, I wish there was another way. But there  ain't.\"    Mis' Winslow looked up from her overshoes.    \"I don't believe there's never 'no other way,'\" she said. \"There's  always another way....\"    \"Not without money,\" said Mis' Bates.    \"Money,\" Mis' Winslow said, \"money. That's like setting up one day of  peace on earth, good will to men, and asking admission to it.\"    \"Mis' Winslow,\" said Mis' Moran, sadly, \"what's the use of saying  anything? You know as well as I do that Christmas is abused all up and  down the land, and made a day of expense and extravagance and folks  overspending themselves. And we've stopped all that in Old Trail Town.  And now you're trying to make us feel bad.\"    \"I ain't,\" said Mis' Winslow, \"we felt bad about it already, and you  know it. I'm glad we've stopped all that. But I wish't we had something  to put in its place. I wish't we had.\"    \"What in time are them children doing?\" said Mis' Moran, abruptly.    The three women looked. On the side lawn, where a spreading balsam had  been left untrimmed to the ground, stood little Emily Moran and Gussie  and Bennet and Tab and Pep. And the four boys had their caps in their  hands, and Gussie, having untied her own hood, turned to take off little  Emily's. The wind, sweeping sharply round the corner of the house, blew  their hair wildly and caught at muffler ends. Mis' Bates and Mis'  Moran, with one impulse, ran to the side door, and Mis' Winslow  followed.    \"Emily,\" said Mis' Moran, \"put on your hood this minute.\"    \"Gussie,\" said Mis' Bates, \"put on your cap this instant second. What  you got it off for? And little Emily doing as you do--I'm su'prised at  you.\"    The children consulted briefly, then Pep turned to the two women, by now  coming down the path, Mis' Bates with her apron over her head, Mis'  Moran in her shawl.    \"Please,\" said Pep, \"it's a funeral. An' we thought we'd ought to take  our caps off till it gets under.\"    \"A funeral,\" said Mis' Bates. \"Who you burying?\"    \"It's just a rehearsal funeral,\" Pep explained; \"the real one's going to  be Christmas.\"    By now the two women were restoring hood and stocking cap to the little  girls, and it was Mis' Winslow, who had followed, who spoke to Pep.    \"Who's dead, Pep?\" she asked.    Between the belief of \"Who's dead?\" and the skepticism of \"Who you  burying?\" the child was swift to distinguish.    \"Sandy Claus,\" he answered readily.    Mis' Winslow stood looking down at him. Pep stepped nearer.    \"We're doing it for little Emily,\" he said confidentially. \"She couldn't  get it straight about where Sandy Claus would be this Christmas. The  rest of us--knew. But Emily's little--so we thought we'd play bury him  on her 'count.\"    Mis' Bates, who had not heard, turned "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20521"],[0,"The New York Times Current History, A Monthly Magazine (#11)"],[1," subjugated children.    For the German people, this people of progress and civilization, which  has never aspired to a world hegemony by the subjugation of other  peoples, outside of the needs of their frontiers, Greece feels the  same admiration and sympathy. And when such French patriots as Jules  Huret and Georges Bourdon, in voluminous works, have cited the German  progress and German social civilization as an example to their own  country, it would be almost a reversal of logic if we outsiders were  to deny these things, at the sight of two friends who have come to  blows.    If there is anything that grieves the Greek soul, which has always  been used to appreciate virtue disinterestedly, it is the fratricidal  woe of two nations who ought to be, hand in hand, forerunners and  co-workers in the great enterprises of science and civilization!      PRIME MINISTRY'S ATTITUDE.    _Premier Venizelos set forth the Government's neutral policy in his  speech to Parliament on Sept. 15, (28,) 1914. A translation appears  below._    _After speaking of the Greco-Turkish relations and the efforts being  made at the time for the settlement of the outstanding questions of  the refugees and the Aegean Islands, Mr. Venizelos said:_    Unfortunately the labors of the new session are beginning amid the  clangor of the great European war. The Government has declared that  during this war Greece is to remain neutral, but at the same time it  did not conceal the fact that it has obligations toward one of the  belligerents, Servia, and that said obligation it was resolved to  fulfill faithfully should the _casus foederis_ arise.    Greece, however, wishes nothing more than that such an occasion should  not arise, as it desires that the conflagration which is gradually  enveloping Europe should not spread over the Balkans, whose peoples,  after two wars, so much need rest.    So far as it depends upon the initiative of Greece, every one may be  assured that the European conflagration will not spread in the Balkan  Peninsula. And if its other peoples are inspired by the same thoughts,  then we can feel sure that peace will be preserved in the Levant up to  the end of the war.    But even for the neutrals there are obligations. The position of the  neutrals is not so easy as one might think, and the Government has  endeavored and is still endeavoring to fulfill as perfectly as  possible the various obligations imposed by neutrality. I must  acknowledge at this time that my task has been rendered easier by  public opinion, which notwithstanding its sympathies, has done nothing  to hurt any one of the belligerents. I regret that I cannot say the  same as regards the press, because the press, not confining itself to  the expression of so many natural sentiments, has often indulged in  violent attacks against the belligerents, and especially at the time  when, owing to the peculiar psychological condition in which the  latter find themselves, every such attack touches them most deeply.  And I again entreat you, from this official tribune, to avoid any such  attack. I hope my advice will be more willingly complied with at this  time.      WHERE GREECE STANDS.    _The following statement by Premier Venizelos was published in the  Corriere della Sera of Milan on Oct. 29, 1914._    The Greek Government has declared its neutrality and will abide by  this policy. Notwithstanding this, she did not deny her treaty  obligations to Servia, and is resolved to fulfill all the terms of  this treaty should the _casus foederis_ arise.    It is understood that Greece does not desire this _casus foederis_ to  arise.    Our relations with Turkey have been strained for some months. But  after the negotiations of Bucharest some agreement was reached  regarding the refugees. Those in Europe will learn that the Greeks  expelled two hundred thousand persons from Thrace and Asia Minor. One  portion of them we have settled in the islands. Besides those there  are about fifty thousand Turkish refugees--though not persecuted--in  Macedonia. A mixed committee was to arrange the exchange of these  refugees at the beginning of the war. As to the question of the  ownership of the Aegean islands, the Hellenic Government considers the  question settled from an international standpoint, not only by the  treaties of London and Athens, but also by the unanimous decision of  all the European powers.    The Government declared that it was ready to satisfy Turkey regarding  this question, under the _sine qua_ condition that the islands would  continue to be occupied and administered by Greece in the same way as  all the other provinces of the Hellenic Kingdom. After an exchange of  views on the subject, it was decided that I should meet the Grand  Vizier in Brussels, but the war prevented this.    Afterward, this desire was again expressed, that the negotiations  which originally were to take place in Brussels should open elsewhere.  To this end both parties sent delegates to Bucharest in order to find  some solution of the island question, but again this meeting failed to  accomplish anything.    Turkey proposed an adjournment of the negotiations to a more  propitious time, alleging that the general conditions in Europe, and  her internal troubles, made it impossible for her delegates to  continue the discussions on the island question. Unfortunately the  plight of the Greek populations in Turkey is becoming worse every day,  and large numbers of refugees are coming daily to Greece.    Regarding Bulgaria, I can say nothing, except that she keeps repeating  her intention of remaining neutral. At the same time Bulgaria did not  mobilize, therefore we have not taken this measure ourselves.    But naturally--and this must be taken in its widest meaning--when the  flames of a conflagration are licking one's door one must take all the  precautionary measures. Is it not right?    Regarding Epirus, we declared clearly that we have no designs upon  Avlona.      OCCUPATION OF EPIRUS.    _The subjoined statement by Premier Venizelos appeared in The London  Morning Post._    ATHENS, Oct. 27.    In the Chamber of Deputies this evening, in reply to an  interpellation, M. Venizelos, the Premier, stated that Greece had  reoccupied Northern Epirus solely to restore order and security to  those districts already cruelly tried by prolonged bloodshed and  anarchy. The Premier emphasized the provisional character of this  reoccupation, inasmuch as Greece continued to respect the  international agreements regarding Albania.    M. Venizelos was followed by M. Zographos, the late President of the  Epirote Provisional Government, and now Deputy for Attica, who, amid  profound attention and great enthusiasm, recounted the enormous  sacrifices of blood and treasure by the Epirotes for their freedom,  and declared that the liberation of Epirus must this time be final. M.  Rallis, one of the leaders of the Opposition, declared that Epirus was  resolved to remain united with Greece.    I am informed from a diplomatic source that the great powers have  received the announcement of the reoccupation in a friendly spirit,  and no protests have thus far been received from quarters whence they  might have been expected.      RELATIONS WITH BULGARIA.    _Following is an editorial article from the semi-official newspaper  Patris of Athens of Dec. 12, (25,) 1914._    With Bulgaria not one of the Balkan States can come to any  understanding. The neighboring Balkan peoples, at least the  Christians, cannot agree with them--not because they are lacking good  intentions, but because the Bulgarians in their demands are  unreasonable, unjust, insatiable, monstrous, and treacherous; because  the Bulgarians always demand the impossible; because they are pursuing  profits at the expense of third parties, whom they invite to cede  rights obtained by sacrifices and based on the right of war; because,  while they can demand compensations at the expense of a non-Christian  neighbor--to which no one would object--they turn on their  co-religionists, struggling to take away from them what they lawfully  and with sacrifices have acquired.    On account of this policy of the Bulgarians, not one of the Christian  peoples of the Balkan Peninsula believes in the possibility of an  understanding with them. That, also, is Rumania's position.  Accordingly it should be unnecessary to deny the news from Sofia  announcing the attainment of an alleged Rumano-Bulgarian  rapprochement. In order to reach this understanding, the Bulgarians  would not confine themselves to the rules of present Rumano-Bulgarian  practice, which in itself is a question of secondary importance.    The Bulgarians turn eager eyes to the whole of Dobrondja, which might  perhaps be the dowry of the royal Rumano-Bulgarian match so impudently  heralded in Sofia, although the whole thing was a monstrous lie,  without any appearance of respect for the family affairs of the royal  throne of Rumania.    But, as in our own case, neither the Servians can cede even an acre of  land to Bulgaria nor Rumania give back Dobrudja, because all of these  territories belong to their present owners by right of war. For the  same reason the Serbo-Bulgarian relations failed a month ago; likewise  no ground was found for an understanding between Bulgaria and Greece;  and for the same reason the negotiations between Rumania and Bulgaria  are failing today.    The Bulgarians have turned from one to another of the peoples of the  Balkans in order to cheat them. But this attempt, made once too often,  at length has failed. But will this final failure bring to reason the  hotheads of Sofia? After the cruel disappointment they received at the  hands of Rumania, the Bulgarian politicians must understand that  whatever is won by war by war only is given back. No one is so stupid  as to give them willingly his dominions.    Do they wish to take them? Let them come. Let them declare war."]]]
