Had they sought to assert  their cause through begging, pleading, and compromise, trade-unionism  would today be a negligible quantity.  In France, in Spain, in Italy,  in Russia, nay even in England (witness the growing rebellion of  English labor unions) direct, revolutionary, economic action has  become so strong a force in the battle for industrial liberty as to  make the world realize the tremendous importance of labor's power.  The General Strike, the supreme expression of the economic  consciousness of the workers, was ridiculed in America but a short  time ago.  Today every great strike, in order to win, must realize  the importance of the solidaric general protest.    Direct action, having proven effective along economic lines, is  equally potent in the environment of the individual.  There a hundred  forces encroach upon his being, and only persistent resistance to  them will finally set him free.  Direct action against the authority  in the shop, direct action against the authority of the law, direct  action against the invasive, meddlesome authority of our moral code,  is the logical, consistent method of Anarchism.    Will it not lead to a revolution?  Indeed, it will.  No real social  change has ever come about without a revolution.  People are either  not familiar with their history, or they have not yet learned that  revolution is but thought carried into action.    Anarchism, the great leaven of thought, is today permeating every  phase of human endeavor.  Science, art, literature, the drama, the  effort for economic betterment, in fact every individual and social  opposition to the existing disorder of things, is illumined by the  spiritual light of Anarchism.  It is the philosophy of the  sovereignty of the individual.  It is the theory of social harmony.  It is the great, surging, living truth that is reconstructing the  world, and that will usher in the Dawn.          MINORITIES VERSUS MAJORITIES      If I were to give a summary of the tendency of our times, I would  say, Quantity.  The multitude, the mass spirit, dominates everywhere,  destroying quality.  Our entire life--production, politics, and  education--rests on quantity, on numbers.  The worker who once took  pride in the thoroughness and quality of his work, has been replaced  by brainless, incompetent automatons, who turn out enormous  quantities of things, valueless to themselves, and generally  injurious to the rest of mankind.  Thus quantity, instead of adding  to life's comforts and peace, has merely increased man's burden.    In politics, naught but quantity counts.  In proportion to its  increase, however, principles, ideals, justice, and uprightness are  completely swamped by the array of numbers.  In the struggle for  supremacy the various political parties outdo each other in trickery,  deceit, cunning, and shady machinations, confident that the one who  succeeds is sure to be hailed by the majority as the victor.  That is  the only god,--Success.  As to what expense, what terrible cost to  character, is of no moment.  We have not far to go in search of proof  to verify this sad fact.    Never before did the corruption, the complete rottenness of our  government stand so thoroughly exposed; never before were the  American people brought face to face with the Judas nature of that  political body, which has claimed for years to be absolutely beyond  reproach, as the mainstay of our institutions, the true protector of  the rights and liberties of the people.    Yet when the crimes of that party became so brazen that even the  blind could see them, it needed but to muster up its minions, and its  supremacy was assured.  Thus the very victims, duped, betrayed,  outraged a hundred times, decided, not against, but in favor of the  victor.  Bewildered, the few asked how could the majority betray the  traditions of American liberty?  Where was its judgment, its  reasoning capacity?  That is just it, the majority cannot reason; it  has no judgment.  Lacking utterly in originality and moral courage,  the majority has always placed its destiny in the hands of others.  Incapable of standing responsibilities, it has followed its leaders  even unto destruction.  Dr. Stockman was right: \"The most dangerous  enemies of truth and justice in our midst are the compact majorities,  the damned compact majority.\"  Without ambition or initiative, the  compact mass hates nothing so much as innovation.  It has always  opposed, condemned, and hounded the innovator, the pioneer of a new  truth.    The oft repeated slogan of our time is, among all politicians, the  Socialists included, that ours is an era of individualism, of the  minority.  Only those who do not probe beneath the surface might be  led to entertain this view.  Have not the few accumulated the wealth  of the world?  Are they not the masters, the absolute kings of the  situation?  Their success, however, is due not to individualism, but  to the inertia, the cravenness, the utter submission of the mass.  The latter wants but to be dominated, to be led, to be coerced.  As  to individualism, at no time in human history did it have less chance  of expression, less opportunity to assert itself in a normal, healthy  manner.    The individual educator imbued with honesty of purpose, the artist or  writer of original ideas, the independent scientist or explorer, the  non-compromising pioneers of social changes are daily pushed to the  wall by men whose learning and creative ability have become decrepit  with age.    Educators of Ferrer's type are nowhere tolerated, while the  dietitians of predigested food, a la Professors Eliot and Butler, are  the successful perpetuators of an age of nonentities, of automatons.  In the literary and dramatic world, the Humphrey Wards and Clyde  Fitches are the idols of the mass, while but few know or appreciate  the beauty and genius of an Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman; an Ibsen, a  Hauptmann, a Butler Yeats, or a Stephen Phillips.  They are like  solitary stars, far beyond the horizon of the multitude.    Publishers, theatrical managers, and critics ask not for the quality  inherent in creative art, but will it meet with a good sale, will it  suit the palate of the people?  Alas, this palate is like a dumping  ground; it relishes anything that needs no mental mastication.  As a  result, the mediocre, the ordinary, the commonplace represents the  chief literary output.    Need I say that in art we are confronted with the same sad facts?  One has but to inspect our parks and thoroughfares to realize the  hideousness and vulgarity of the art manufacture.  Certainly, none  but a majority taste would tolerate such an outrage on art.  False in  conception and barbarous in execution, the statuary that infests  American cities has as much relation to true art, as a totem to a  Michael Angelo.  Yet that is the only art that succeeds.  The true  artistic genius, who will not cater to accepted notions, who  exercises originality, and strives to be true to life, leads an  obscure and wretched existence.  His work may some day become the fad  of the mob, but not until his heart's blood had been exhausted; not  until the pathfinder has ceased to be, and a throng of an idealless  and visionless mob has done to death the heritage of the master.    It is said that the artist of today cannot create because  Prometheus-like he is bound to the rock of economic necessity.  This, however, is true of art in all ages.  Michael Angelo was  dependent on his patron saint, no less than the sculptor or painter  of today, except that the art connoisseurs of those days were far  away from the madding crowd.  They felt honored to be permitted to  worship at the shrine of the master.    The art protector of our time knows but one criterion, one  value,--the dollar.  He is not concerned about the quality of any  great work, but in the quantity of dollars his purchase implies.  Thus the financier in Mirbeau's LES AFFAIRES SONT LES AFFAIRES points  to some blurred arrangement in colors, saying \"See how great it is;  it cost 50,000 francs.\"  Just like our own parvenues.  The fabulous  figures paid for their great art discoveries must make up for the  poverty of their taste.    The most unpardonable sin in society is independence of thought.  That this should be so terribly apparent in a country whose symbol is  democracy, is very significant of the tremendous power of the  majority.    Wendell Phillips said fifty years ago: \"In our country of absolute  democratic equality, public opinion is not only omnipotent, it is  omnipresent.  There is no refuge from its tyranny, there is no hiding  from its reach, and the result is that if you take the old Greek  lantern and go about to seek among a hundred, you will not find a  single American who has not, or who does not fancy at least he has,  something to gain or lose in his ambition, his social life, or  business, from the good opinion and the votes of those around him.  And the consequence is that instead of being a mass of individuals,  each one fearlessly blurting out his own conviction, as a nation  compared to other nations we are a mass of cowards.  More than any  other people we are afraid of each other.\"  Evidently we have not  advanced very far from the condition that confronted Wendell  Phillips.    Today, as then, public opinion is the omnipresent tyrant; today, as  then, the majority represents a mass of cowards, willing to accept  him who mirrors its own soul and mind poverty.  That accounts for the  unprecedented rise of a man like Roosevelt.  He embodies the very  worst element of mob psychology.  A politician, he knows that the  majority cares little for ideals or integrity.  What it craves is  display.  It matters not whether that be a dog show, a prize fight,  the lynching of a \"nigger,\" the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21630"],[0,"Bibliomania in the Middle Ages (#11)"],[1," but I am prone to doubt this assertion, for my own  observations do not help to prove it. Mr. Hallam says, that in  consequence of this, \"an unfortunate practice gained ground of erasing a  manuscript in order to substitute another on the same skin. This  occasioned, probably, the loss of many ancient authors who have made way  for the legends of saints, or other ecclesiastical rubbish.\"[80] But we  may reasonably question this opinion, when we consider the value of books  in the middle ages, and with what esteem the monks regarded, in spite of  all their paganism, those \"heathen dogs\" of the ancient world. A doubt  has often forced itself upon my mind when turning over the \"crackling  leaves\" of many ancient MSS., whether the peculiarity mentioned by  Montfaucon, and described as parchment from which former writing had been  erased, may not be owing, in many cases, to its mode of preparation. It  is true, a great proportion of the membrane on which the writings of the  middle ages are inscribed, appear rough and uneven, but I could not  detect, through many manuscripts of a hundred folios--all of which  evinced this roughness--the unobliterated remains of a single letter. And  when I have met with instances, they appear to have been short  writings--perhaps epistles; for the monks were great correspondents, and,  I suspect, kept economy in view, and often carried on an epistolary  intercourse, for a considerable time, with a very limited amount of  parchment, by erasing the letter to make room for the answer. This,  probably, was usual where the matter of their correspondence was of no  especial importance; so that, what our modern critics, being emboldened  by these faint traces of former writing, have declared to possess the  classic appearance of hoary antiquity, may be nothing more than a  complimentary note, or the worthless accounts of some monastic  expenditure. But, careful as they were, what would these monks have  thought of \"paper-sparing Pope,\" who wrote his Iliad on small pieces of  refuse paper? One of the finest passages in that translation, which  describes the parting of Hector and Andromache, is written on part of a  letter which Addison had franked, and is now preserved in the British  Museum. Surely he could afford, these old monks would have said, to  expend some few shillings for paper, on which to inscribe that for which  he was to receive his thousand pounds.    But far from the monastic manuscripts displaying a scantiness of  parchment, we almost invariably find an abundant margin, and a space  between each line almost amounting to prodigality; and to say that the  \"vellum was considered more precious than the genius of the author,\"[81]  is absurd, when we know that, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,  a dozen skins of parchment could be bought for sixpence; whilst that  quantity written upon, if the subject possessed any interest at all,  would fetch considerably more, there always being a demand and ready sale  for books.[82] The supposition, therefore, that the monastic scribes  erased _classical_ manuscripts for the sake of the material, seems  altogether improbable, and certainly destitute of proof. It is true, many  of the classics, as we have them now, are but mere fragments of the  original work. For this, however, we have not to blame the monks, but  barbarous invaders, ravaging flames, and the petty animosities of civil  and religious warfare for the loss of many valuable works of the  classics. By these means, one hundred and five books of Livy have been  lost to us, probably forever. For the thirty which have been preserved,  our thanks are certainly due to the monks. It was from their unpretending  and long-forgotten libraries that many such treasures were brought forth  at the revival of learning, in the fifteenth century, to receive the  admiration of the curious, and the study of the erudite scholar. In this  way Poggio Bracciolini discovered many inestimable manuscripts. Leonardo  Aretino writes in rapturous terms on Poggio's discovery of a perfect copy  of Quintillian. \"What a precious acquisition!\" he exclaims, \"what  unthought of pleasure to behold Quintillian perfect and entire!\"[83] In  the same letter we learn that Poggio had discovered Asconius and Flaccus  in the monastery of St. Gall, whose inhabitants regarded them without  much esteem. In the monastery of Langres, his researches were rewarded by  a copy of Cicero's Oration for Caecina. With the assistance of Bartolomeo  di Montepulciano, he discovered Silius Italicus, Lactantius, Vegetius,  Nonius Marcellus, Ammianus Marcellus, Lucretius, and Columella, and he  found in a monastery at Rome a complete copy of Turtullian.[84] In the  fine old monastery of Casino, so renowned for its classical library in  former days, he met with Julius Frontinus and Firmicus, and transcribed  them with his own hand. At Cologne he obtained a copy of Petronius  Arbiter. But to these we may add Calpurnius's Bucolic,[85] Manilius,  Lucius Septimus, Coper, Eutychius, and Probus. He had anxious hopes of  adding a perfect Livy to the list, which he had been told then existed in  a Cistercian Monastery in Hungary, but, unfortunately, he did not  prosecute his researches in this instance with his usual energy. The  scholar has equally to regret the loss of a perfect Tacitus, which Poggio  had expectations of from the hands of a German monk. We may still more  deplore this, as there is every probability that the monks actually  possessed the precious volume.[86] Nicolas of Treves, a contemporary and  friend of Poggio's, and who was infected, though in a slight degree, with  the same passionate ardor for collecting ancient manuscripts, discovered,  whilst exploring the German monasteries, twelve comedies of Plautus, and  a fragment of Aulus Gellius.[87] Had it not been for the timely aid of  these great men, many would have been irretrievably lost in the many  revolutions and contentions that followed; and, had such been the case,  the monks, of course, would have received the odium, and on their heads  the spleen of the disappointed student would have been prodigally  showered.

The Statutes of the Dominican order are       particularly impressive on this point, and enforce a constant       reading and critical study of the sacred volume, so as to fortify       themselves for disputation; they were to peruse it continually, and       apply to it before all other reading _semper ante aliam lectionem_.       _Martene Thesan.
