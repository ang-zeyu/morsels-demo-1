To pay such a vagabond ten dollars a week, when a boy  of good family, like Roswell, can get but four, is perfectly  ridiculous.\"    \"I don't believe he gets so much,\" said Roswell. \"It's only one of his  big stories.\"    \"You're mistaken there,\" said Gilbert. \"He does get exactly that.\"    \"Are you sure of it?\"    \"I ought to be, since I received directions from Mr. Rockwell to-day to  pay him that amount to-morrow night, that being the end of the week.\"    \"I never heard of such a thing!\" ejaculated Mrs. Crawford. \"The man must  be a simpleton.\"    \"If he is, there's another besides him.\"    \"Who do you mean?\"    \"Mrs. Rockwell.\"    \"Has she made acquaintance with the boot-black, then?\" asked Roswell,  with a sneer.    \"Yes, he visited them last evening at their house.\"    \"Did he tell you so?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I should think they'd feel honored by such a visitor.\"    \"Probably they did, for Mrs. Rockwell made him a present of a gold  watch.\"    \"WHAT!\" exclaimed Roswell and his mother in concert.    \"It's true. I sent him out to ask the time to-day, when he pulled out a  new gold watch with an air of importance, and told me the time.\"    \"Was it a good watch?\"    \"A very handsome one. It must have cost, with the chain, a hundred and  twenty-five dollars.\"    \"The idea of a boot-black with a gold watch!\" exclaimed Roswell, with a  sneer. \"It's about as appropriate as a pig in a silk dress.\"    \"I can't understand it at all,\" said Mrs. Crawford. \"It can't be that  he's a poor relation of theirs, can it?\"    \"I should say not. Mr. Rockwell wouldn't be likely to have a relation  reduced to blacking boots.\"    \"Is the boy so attractive, then? What does he look like?\"    \"He's as bold as brass, and hasn't got any manners nor education,\" said  Roswell.    Poor Dick! His ears ought to have tingled, considering the complimentary  things that were said of him this evening. But luckily he knew nothing  about it, and, if he had, it is doubtful whether it would have troubled  him much. He was independent in his ideas, and didn't trouble himself  much about the opinion of others, as long as he felt that he was doing  right as nearly as he knew how.    \"Do you think this strange fancy of Mr. Rockwell's is going to last?\"  inquired Mrs. Crawford. \"I wish Roswell could have got in there.\"    \"So do I, but I couldn't accomplish it.\"    \"If this boy should fall out of favor, there might be a chance for  Roswell yet; don't you think so?\" asked Mrs. Crawford.    \"I wish there might,\" said Roswell. \"I'd like to see that beggar's pride  humbled. Besides, four dollars a week is such a miserable salary.\"    \"You thought yourself lucky when you got it.\"    \"So I did; but that was before I found out how much this boot-black was  getting.\"    \"Well,\" said Gilbert, \"he isn't a favorite of mine, as you know well  enough. If there's anything I can do to oust him, I shall do it.\"    \"Couldn't you leave some money in his way? He might be tempted to steal  it.\"    \"I don't know yet what course would be best. I'll try to get him into  trouble of some kind. But I can tell better by and by what to do.\"    Gilbert went up to his room, and Mrs. Crawford and Roswell were left  alone.    \"I wish you were at Rockwell & Cooper's, Roswell,\" said his mother.    \"So do I, mother; but it's no use wishing.\"    \"I don't know about that. Your cousin ought to have some influence  there.\"    \"The boot-black's in the way.\"    \"He may not be in the way always. Your cousin may detect him in  something that will cause his discharge.\"    \"Even if he does, I've tried once to get in there, and didn't succeed.  They didn't seem to take a fancy to me.\"    \"I shouldn't expect them to, if they take a fancy to a common street  boy. But when they find him out, they may change their opinion of you.\"    \"I don't know how that will be, mother. At any rate, I think I ought to  get more than four dollars a week where I am. Why, there's Talbot, only  two years older than I, gets eight dollars, and I do more than he. To  tell the truth, I don't like the place. I don't like to be seen carrying  round bundles. It isn't fit work for a gentleman's son.\"    Roswell forgot that many of the most prosperous merchants in the city  began in that way, only on less wages. One who wants to climb the ladder  of success must, except in very rare cases, commence at the lowest  round. This was what Roswell did not like. He wanted to begin half-way  up at the very least. It was a great hindrance to him that he regarded  himself as a gentleman's son, and was puffed up with a corresponding  sense of his own importance.    The more Roswell thought of his ill-requited services, as he considered  them, the more he felt aggrieved. It may be mentioned that he was  employed in a dry goods store on Sixth Avenue, and was chiefly engaged  in carrying out bundles for customers. A circumstance which occurred  about this time deepened his disgust with the place.    About the middle of the next week he was carrying a heavy bundle to a  house on Madison Avenue. Now it happened that Mr. Rockwell, who, it will  be remembered, lived on the same street, had left home that morning,  quite forgetting an important letter which he had received, and which  required an early answer. He therefore summoned Dick, and said,  \"Richard, do you remember the location of my house?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Dick.    \"I find I have left an important letter at home. I have written a line  to my wife, that she may know where to look for it. I want you to go up  at once.\"    \"Very well, sir.\"    Dick took the note, and, walking to Broadway, jumped on board an  omnibus, and in a few minutes found himself opposite the Fifth Avenue  Hotel. Here he alighted, and, crossing the Park, entered Madison Avenue,  then as now lined with fine houses.    Walking briskly up the avenue, he overtook a boy of about his own size,  with a large bundle under his arm. Glancing at him as he passed, he  recognized Roswell Crawford.    \"How are you, Crawford?\" said Dick, in an offhand manner.    Roswell looked at the speaker, whom he recognized.    \"I'm well,\" said he, in a stiff, ungracious manner.    Ashamed of the large bundle he was carrying, he would rather have been  seen by any boy than Dick, under present circumstances. He did not fail  to notice Dick's neat dress, and the gold chain displayed on his vest.  Indeed there was nothing in Dick's appearance which would have been  inconsistent with the idea that he lived on the avenue, and was, what  Roswell claimed to be, a gentleman's son. It seemed to Roswell that Dick  was immensely presumptuous in swaggering up Madison Avenue in such a  style, as he mentally called it, and he formed the benevolent design of  \"taking down his pride,\" and making him feel uncomfortable, if possible.    \"Have you lost your place?\" he inquired.    \"No,\" said Dick, \"not yet. It's very kind of you to inquire.\"    \"I suppose they pay you for walking the streets, then,\" he said, with a  sneer.    \"Yes,\" said Dick, composedly; \"that's one of the things they pay me  for.\"    \"I suppose you like it better than blacking boots?\" said Roswell, who,  supposing that Dick was ashamed of his former occupation, felt a  malicious pleasure in reminding him of it.    \"Yes,\" said Dick, \"I like it better on the whole; but then there's some  advantages about boot-blackin'.\"    \"Indeed!\" said Roswell, superciliously. \"As I was never in the business,  I can't of course decide.\"    \"Then I was in business for myself, you see, and was my own master. Now  I have to work for another man.\"    \"You don't seem to be working very hard now,\" said Roswell, enviously.    \"Not very,\" said Dick. \"You must be tired carrying that heavy bundle.  I'll carry it for you as far as I go.\"    Roswell, who was not above accepting a favor from a boy he didn't like,  willingly transferred it to our hero.    \"I carried it out just to oblige,\" he said, as if he were not in the  daily habit of carrying such packages.    \"That's very kind of you,\" said Dick.    Roswell did not know whether Dick spoke sarcastically or not, and  therefore left the remark unnoticed.    \"I don't think I shall stay where I am very long,\" he said.    \"Don't you like?\" asked Dick.    \"Not very well. I'm not obliged to work for a living,\" added Roswell,  loftily, but not altogether truly.    \"I am,\" said Dick. \"I've had to work for a living ever since I was six  years old. I suppose you work because you like it.\"    \"I'm learning business. I'm going to be a merchant, as my father was.\"    \"I'll have to give up the bundle now,\" said Dick. \"This is as far as I  am going.\"    Roswell took back his bundle, and Dick went up the steps of Mr.  Rockwell's residence and rang the door-bell.          CHAPTER X.    A STORE ON SIXTH AVENUE.      Roswell kept on his way with his heavy bundle, more discontented than  ever. The bundle seemed heavier than ever. Dick had no such bundles to  carry. He had an easier time, his business position was better, and his  wages more than double. And all this in spite of the glaring fact that  Roswell was a gentleman's son, and Dick wasn't. Surely fortune was very  blind, and unfair in the distribution of her favors.    \"I suppose he'll be crowing over me,\" thought Roswell, bitterly, judging  from what would have been his own feeling had the case been reversed. \"I  hope he'll have to go back to boot-blacking some day. I wish mother'd  buy me a gold watch and chain.

How precious were the simple  devout hymns and prayers in our own tongue wherein we were born! There  was an American Thanksgiving sermon,--eloquent, earnest, magnetic.  Strangers in a strange land, we felt that we could never be homesick  in a city where was such a service. This Union Church service was  established some twenty-five or thirty years ago, Governor Wright,  then United States Minister to Germany, being prominently connected  with its beginnings. There is now a regular church organization, with  the Bible and the Apostles' Creed as its doctrinal basis. For eight or  nine years past, the present pastor, the Rev. J.H.W. Stueckenberg,  D.D., born in Germany, but a loyal and devoted soldier and citizen of  the American Republic, has, with his accomplished wife, been  indefatigable in caring for the services, and administering to the  needs--physical, social, and religious--of Americans in Berlin. The  first gathering which we attended in the city was an American  Thanksgiving Banquet, under the auspices of the \"Ladies' Social Union\"  connected with this \"American Chapel.\" Invitations were issued to an  \"American Home Gathering,\" for Thanksgiving evening, to be held in the  Architectenhaus at six o'clock. Greetings, witty and wise, were  extended to the assembled company of some two hundred, by a lady from  Boston; grace was said by Professor Mead, formerly of Andover, and the  American Thanksgiving dinner was duly appreciated, though some of us  had in part forestalled its appetizing pleasures by attendance at a  delightful private afternoon dinner-party, where the true home flavors  had been heightened by the shadow of the American flag which draped  its silken folds above the table, depending from candelabra in which  \"red, white, and blue\" wax lights were burning.    Only the initiated can know what such an American Thanksgiving dinner  as that given in this public entertainment in Germany must mean to the  painstaking ladies, who need to direct every detail in contravention  of the established customs of the country. Turkey was forthcoming, but  cranberries were sought far and wide in vain, until Dresden at last  sent an imitation of the American berry, to keep it company. Mince  pies were regarded as essential to the feast. As pies are here  unknown, the pie-plates must be made to order after repeated and  untold minuteness of direction to the astonished tinman. The ordinary  kitchen ranges of Germany are without ovens, and all cake and pastry,  as well as bread, must emerge from the baker's oven. So to the shop of  the baker two ladies repaired, to mix with their own hands the pastry  and to prepare the mince-meat, graciously declining the yeast and  eggs offered them for the purpose. The delicious results justified in  practical proof the tireless endeavor for a real home-like American  dinner. Our German friends laughed at the \"dry banquet\" where only  lemonade and coffee kept the viands company, but right good cheer was  not wanting. Before the guests rose from table, the pastor read  letters of regret from Minister Pendleton (absent in affliction) and  others, and proposed the health of the President of the United States  and of Mrs. Cleveland, who, as Miss Folsom, shared in the Berlin  festivities of Americans at Thanksgiving the year before. The toast  which followed--to the aged Emperor William--was most cordially  responded to by a member of the Empress's household, Count Bernsdorff,  endeared to many in both hemispheres by his active interest in  whatsoever things are true and of good report. Rare music was  discoursed at intervals, from a band in the gallery, alternating with  amateur performers on the violin and piano, from under the German and  American flags intertwined at the opposite end of the handsome hall.  The good name of American students of music in Berlin was well  deserved, judging from their contributions to the enjoyment of this  occasion. The evening's programme closed with our national airs in  grand chorus, cheering and inspiring all. To some hearts the dear  melody of \"The Suwanee River,\" which afterwards floated out on the  evening air of the busy city, mingled a pathos before unsuspected with  the good-nights and the adieus, and brought an undertone of sadness  caused by the knowledge that we were far from home, and that our loved  ones, from Atlantic to Pacific, were returning from their Thanksgiving  sermon, or later gathering about the festal board, at the hour when  we, wanderers, were clustered in the heart of the German Empire with  like purpose and in like precious faith and memory.    The Sunday services of this enterprise are now held in an edifice  belonging to a German Methodist church, which can be had for one  service only, at an hour which will not interfere with the uses which  have a prior claim. The Sunday evenings, when a goodly congregation  might be gathered if a suitable audience-room could be had, are times  of loneliness and homesickness to many American youth and others far  from home and friends. Dr. and Mrs. Stueckenberg have generously  opened their own pleasant home at 18 Buelow Strasse for Sunday-evening  receptions to Americans. Their large and beautiful apartments were  much too small to accommodate all who would gladly have gathered  there. But in the course of the season there were few Americans  attending the morning service who were not to be met, one Sunday  evening or another, in the parlors of the pastor and his wife; and  many others, students, were nearly always there. A half-hour was given  on these occasions to social greetings; then followed familiar hymns,  led by the piano and a volunteer choir of young people, after which an  informal lecture was given by the pastor. Dr. Stueckenberg emigrated  with his parents to America in early childhood, but has studied in the  Universities of Halle, Goettingen, Berlin, and Tuebingen. His large  acquaintance with German scholars enabled him to give most interesting  reminiscences of the teaching and personality of some of these, his  teachers and friends. Among the talks which we remember vividly were  those on Tholuck, Doerner, and Von Ranke. At another time Dr.  Stueckenberg gave a series of lectures on Socialism,--a theme whose  manifold aspects he has studied profoundly, and which, in Germany as  elsewhere, is the question of the hour, the day, and the century, and  perhaps of the next century too. After the lecture there generally  followed prayer and another hymn, and always slight refreshments,--tea  and sandwiches, or little cakes,--over which all chatted and were free  to go when they would. Many were the occasions when, in these  gatherings, every heart seemed to partake of the gladness radiated by  the magnetic host and hostess; and all Europe seemed brighter because  of these homelike, social, Christian Sunday evenings which lighted up  the sojourn in Berlin. The effort now being made to build a permanent  and commodious church edifice for Americans in Berlin is a pressing  necessity.    Dr. Christlieb, the eminent Professor of Theology and University  Preacher in Bonn, asserts that the number of American students in  Berlin is now by far the largest congregated in any one place in  Germany. The number, as stated in 1888 by Rev. Dr. Philip Schaff, was  about four hundred, besides the numerous American travellers there  every year for a longer or shorter time. Seventeen denominations have  been represented in this church in a single year, and any evangelical  minister in good standing in his own church is eligible to election as  its pastor. From the beginning these union services have been entirely  harmonious; and Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians,  Baptists, Lutherans, and Episcopalians have been chiefly active in  promoting them.    The churches of the royal suburb of Potsdam possess an interest quite  equal to that of those in Berlin. The Potsdam Garrison Church, in  general interior outlines, reminds one of some quaint New England  meeting-house of the early part of the eighteenth century. But here  the resemblance ceases. The ancient arrangement of windows and  galleries impresses one only at the moment of entering, attention  being presently diverted to the flags clustered on the gallery pillars  and on either side the pulpit, in two rows,--the lower captured from  the French in the wars with the First Napoleon, the upper taken in the  late contests with Austria and with Napoleon III. Altar-cloths and  other furnishings are heavily embroidered with the handiwork of  vanished queens. But the chief interest centres in the vault under the  handsome marble pulpit. In this vault, on the left, are the mortal  remains of the old Prussian King, Frederick William I.,--father of  Frederick the Great,--a character hard to understand, and interpreted  differently as one surveys him in the light of Macaulay's genius or  that of Carlyle. But one cannot help hoping that the final verdict  will be with the latter; and as we stand in this solemn place, memory  recalls the day--the midnight, rather--when this same oak coffin, long  before the death of the King made ready by his orders in the old  Palace of Potsdam close at hand, at last received its burden, and was  borne in Spartan simplicity to this place, the torch-lighted band  playing his favorite dirge,--        \"Oh, Sacred Head, now wounded!\"    On the right, separated from the coffin of his father only by the  short aisle, is that of Frederick the Great. Three wreaths were lying  upon it,--placed there by the Emperor and by the Crown Prince and the  Crown Princess on the hundredth anniversary of the death of this  founder of Prussia's greatness, August 17, 1886. Fortunate is the  visitor to Potsdam who does not altogether overlook this Garrison  Church, misled by the brief mention usually accorded to"]]]
