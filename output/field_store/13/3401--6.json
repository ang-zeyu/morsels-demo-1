Air--from \"Lincoln.\"      [Music]    Freedom's consecrated dower,    Casket of a priceless gem!  Nobler heritage of power,    Than imperial diadem!  Corner-stone, on which was reared,    Liberty's triumphal dome,  When her glorious form appeared,    'Midst our own Green Mountain home.    Guard it, Freemen! guard it well,    Spotless as your maiden's fame!  Never let your children tell    Of your weakness, of your shame;  That their fathers basely sold,    What was bought with blood and toil,  That you bartered right for gold,    Here, on Freedom's sacred soil.    Let your eagle's quenchless eye,    Fixed, unerring, sleepless, bright,  Watch, when danger hovers nigh,    From his lofty mountain height;  While the stripes and stars shall wave    O'er this treasure, pure and free--  The land's Palladium, it shall save    The home and shrine of liberty.          Christian Mother.    BY MISS C.      Christian mother, when thy prayer,  Trembles on the twilight air,  And thou askest God to keep  In their waking and their sleep,  Those, whose love is more to thee  Than the wealth of land or sea--  Think of those who wildly mourn  For the loved ones from them torn.    Christian daughter, sister, wife,  Ye who wear a guarded life,  Ye, whose bliss hangs not, thank God,  On a tyrant's word or nod,  Will ye hear, with careless eye,  Of the wild, despairing cry,  Rising up from human hearts,  As their latest bliss departs.    Blest ones, whom no hands on earth,  Dare to wrench from home and hearth,  Ye, whose hearts are sheltered well,  By affection's holy spell;  Oh, forget not those for whom  Life is nought but changeless gloom!  O'er whose days, so woe-begone,  Hope may paint no brighter dawn.          THE LIBERTY PARTY.    Words by E. Wright, jr. Tune--\"'Tis Dawn, the Lark is Singing.\"      [Music]    Will ye despise the acorn,    Just thrusting out its shoot,  Ye giants of the forest,    That strike the deepest root?  Will ye despise the streamlets    Upon the mountain side;  Ye broad and mighty rivers,    On sweeping to the tide?    Wilt thou despise the crescent,    That trembles, newly born,  Thou bright and peerless planet,    Whose reign shall reach the morn?  Time now his scythe is whetting,    Ye giant oaks, for you;  Ye floods, the sea is thirsting,    To drink you like the dew.    That crescent, faint and trembling,    Her lamp shall nightly trim,  Till thou, imperious planet,    Shall in her light grow dim;  And so shall wax the Party,    Now feeble at its birth,  Till Liberty shall cover    This tyrant trodden earth.    That party, as we term it,    The Party of the Whole--  Has for its firm foundation,    The substance of the soul;  It groweth out of Reason,    The strongest soil below;  The smaller is its budding,    The more its room to grow!    Then rally to its banners,    Supported by the true--  The weakest are the waning,    The many are the few:  Of what is small, but living,    God makes himself the nurse;  While \"Onward\" cry the voices    Of all his universe.    Our plant is of the cedar,    That knoweth not decay:  Its growth shall bless the mountains,    Till mountains pass away.  God speed the infant party,    The party of the whole--  And surely he will do it,    While reason is its soul.          BE FREE, O MAN, BE FREE.    Words by Mary H. Maxwell. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    The storm-winds wildly blowing,    The bursting billows mock,  As with their foam-crests glowing,    They dash the sea-girt rock;  Amid the wild commotion,    The revel of the sea,  A voice is on the ocean,    Be free, O man, be free.    Behold the sea-brine leaping    High in the murky air;  List to the tempest sweeping    In chainless fury there.  What moves the mighty torrent,    And bids it flow abroad?  Or turns the rapid current?    What, but the voice of God?    Then, answer, is the spirit    Less noble or less free?  From whom does it inherit    The doom of slavery?  When man can bind the waters,    That they no longer roll,  Then let him forge the fetters    To clog the human soul.    Till then a voice is stealing    From earth and sea, and sky,  And to the soul revealing    Its immortality.  The swift wind chants the numbers    Careering o'er the sea,  And earth aroused from slumbers,    Re-echoes, \"Man, be free.\"          Arouse! Arouse!      Arouse, arouse, arouse!    Ye bold New England men!  No more with sullen brows,    Remain as ye have been:  Your country's freedom calls,    Once bought by patriots' blood;  Rouse, or that freedom falls    Beneath the tyrant's rod!    Three million men in chains,    Your friendly aid implore;  Slight you the piteous strains    That from their bosoms pour?  Shall it be told in story,    Or troll'd in burning song,  New England's boasted glory    Forgot the bondman's wrong?    Shall freeman's sons be taunted,    That freedom's spirit's fled;  That what the fathers vaunted,    With sordid sons is dead?  That they in grovelling gain    Have lost their ancient fire,  And 'neath the despot's chain,    Let liberty expire?    Oh no, your father's bones    Would cry out from the ground;  Ay, e'en New England's stones    Would echo on the sound:  Rouse, then, New England men!    Rally in freedom's name!  In your bosoms once again    Light up the sleeping flame!          THE LAST NIGHT OF SLAVERY.    Tune--\"Cherokee Death-song.\"      [Music]            Let the floods clap their hands,            Let the mountains rejoice,          Let all the glad lands            Breathe a jubilant voice;  The sun that now sets on the waves of the sea  Shall gild with his rising the land of the free.            Let the islands be glad!            For their King in his might,          Who his glory hath clad            With a garment of light,  In the waters the beams of his chambers hath laid,  And in the green waters his pathway hath made.            No more shall the deep,            Lend its awe-stricken waves,          In their caverns to steep            Its wild burden of slaves;  The Lord sitteth King--sitteth King on the flood,  He heard, and hath answered the voice of their blood.            Dispel the blue haze,            Golden fountain of morn!          With meridian blaze            The wide ocean adorn:  The sunlight has touched the glad waves of the sea,  And day now illumines the land of the free.          THE LITTLE SLAVE GIRL.    Words by a Lady. Air--Morgiana in Ireland.      [Music]    When bright morning lights the hills,    Where free children sing most cheerily,  My young breast with sorrow fills,    While here I plod my way so wearily:    Sad my face, more sad my heart,  From home, from all I had to part,  A loving mother, my sister, my brother,  For chains and lash in hopeless misery,    Children try it, could you try it;  But one day to live in slavery,    Children try it, try it, try it;  Come, come, give me liberty.    Ere I close my eyes to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22096"],[0,"Stories the Iroquois Tell Their Children (#11)"],[1,"tion]    When the wolves and panthers saw that they were not gaining on the bull,  they halted to take counsel. They decided that it would take a whole day  of hard running to get the bull, and a hound was near! Why not go for  the hound?    All agreed. They set off for the hound.    Now the bull had heard the wolves and panthers take council, and he,  too, set off for the woods.    As he neared the wood, the bull called to the hound and warned him that  a pack of wolves and panthers was after him. Just then they came into  sight. The hound dared not meet them alone, and he knew not which way to  turn.    Then the bull called, \"Come, jump on my back. I can outrun them.\"    The hound ran and leaped on the back of the bull, and away they went.    The bull and the hound talked as they ran. The bull said he thought the  wolves would soon grow tired, fall back, and give up the chase. But he  was wrong. They were too angry at being outwitted.    \"You think to take our game from us,\" they howled at the bull. \"But we  will eat hound meat to-night.\"    The bull saw it was a run for life. All day he ran. For a time it was  easy to outrun the wolves and panthers, but at last they began to press  hard upon him.    As the sun dropped out of the sky, the bull felt his knees begin to  weaken. The weight of the hound was telling on him. A moment later, he  stumbled and fell.    In an instant, the pack was upon them. But with one leap, the hound  cleared the pack and was off down the trail.    The weaker wolves and panthers leaped upon the bull. The stronger went  on.    But now the best of them were no match for the hound. He was fresh and  strong, for he had been riding all day. They were tired and worn from  the long chase, and soon they gave it up.    Because the hound is able to save his strength for the end of the chase,  he can now outrun not only wolves and panthers, but all the other  animals.          WHY INDIANS NEVER SHOOT PIGEONS      An Indian hunter went into the forest in search of game.    The forest was so large that it would have taken three days to journey  through it. All day he followed the track of the deer, but his arrows  brought him no food.    At night, he came to a dark, swift-running stream. He was tired and  hungry.    \"Here,\" said he, \"I will lie down and rest until sunrise.\"    He began to search for a bed of pine needles, for the Indian loves the  pine tree. It is his friend by day and by night. By day it is his forest  guide. At night it gives him a soft, sweet-smelling bed on which to  sleep, and it shields him from the storm.    The hunter ran along the stream. It was very dark. He felt no soft pine  needles under his moccasined feet, only the knotted roots of trees.    Suddenly the great roots of an oak tree reached out and caught him. He  could not free his foot from the oak's grasp.    The sun rose and set. The great tree still held the hunter fast. He was  weak from pain and hunger.    It was now two days since he had tasted food. Four notches had been cut  in his stick, for the Indian measures time in this way. Each sunrise and  sunset, when he is on the trail, is marked by a notch on a small stick  which he carries.    Three times did the sun again rise and set, yet the tree did not let go  its hold. There were now ten notches on the stick, and the hunter was so  weak that he could scarcely cut the last one.    As the sun rose on the fifth day, a bird flew into the tree. He saw the  hunter lying on the ground, and came close and spoke to him.    The hunter understood, for in those days men and birds could talk  together.    The bird asked the man what he could do for him, and the hunter  whispered, \"You are strong. You can fly a long trail. Go and tell the  chief of my people.\"    The bird flew swiftly away with the message. He did not wait until the  sun was high. He did not stop to eat one berry or one worm. He did not  fly high, nor fly low to talk with other birds. He went straight to the  people the hunter had told him of.    The West Wind tried to blow him back. A black cloud came up to frighten  him, but he went through it. On, and on, and on, he went. Straight to  the wigwam of the chief, he carried his message.    The chief had called together the young men who were fleet of foot, and  was about to send them forth to find the lost hunter. They were asking  the chief what trails they had best take. Before the chief could reply,  a beautiful dove-colored bird had flown close to his ear and had spoken  to him in soft, low tones.    [Illustration]    The chief told the young men what the bird had said, and they set off on  the trail the bird had named. Before sunset, they had found the lost  hunter.    Carefully they freed him from the grasp of the great oak and bore him to  his people. That night there was a feast and a dance in his honor.    Ever since, the Indians have loved the birds that carry the messages,  and they never shoot a pigeon.          HOW OLD MAN WINTER WAS DRIVEN BACK      Far away in the North Sky lives Old Man Winter. Every year he leaves his  wigwam in the sky and comes to earth.    At the foot of a mountain, he builds a lodge of ice and snow, which no  human being, animal, or bird can enter. There he lives for a time.    North Wind is the only friend of Old Man Winter. When he passes near Old  Man Winter's lodge, he gives a loud shriek, and with his blustering  breath he blows open the door and enters.    Near a fire which glows, but does not warm, North Wind finds a seat.  There he and Old Man Winter sit and smoke, and lay their plans for the  next snowstorm.    When the council is ended, North Wind departs, to drive up the snow and  hail from the corners of the earth.    Old Man Winter also leaves his lodge. He stalks over the mountains and  valleys of the Red Children. The land becomes white with his breath. The  rivers are stilled, and all the voices of the wood are hushed as he  passes. A deep sleep falls upon every living thing.    No sound is heard in the forest but the rapping on the trees. Old Man  Winter carries a great hammer, and he strikes the trees a blow as he  passes. The colder it grows, the louder and more frequently he raps. The  trees snap, and the Indian lodges crack with his blows.    One day, as Old Man Winter was stalking through a forest, he came upon a  hunter's lodge. For days the snow had been falling. No track of deer or  rabbit was to be seen, and the hunter and his little boy sat within,  weak from hunger. They were also very cold, for the fire in the lodge  burned low.    Old Man Winter laughed and shook his hammer in glee, as he drew near.  Once, twice, three times, he rapped. The little boy within heard him,  and rapped three times in reply,--just as Old Man Winter had done.    At this, the hunter spoke. He told the boy that he must not mock a  nature spirit, lest some harm should come to him. He might be captured  and made to serve that spirit.    Now when Old Man Winter heard the mocking raps of the little boy within  the lodge, he was very angry. He breathed fiercely upon the little  lodge. It shrank and shivered at his touch like a living thing. He  struck it several sharp blows with his hammer, and passed on.    The fire inside the lodge burned lower and lower. The hunter and his  little son drew closer and watched the last flame flicker and die out.    [Illustration]    As they sat by the ashes, numb with the cold, all of a sudden a new  warmth filled the lodge. The South Wind gently opened the door, and a  young chieftain, with a face like the sun, entered. He saw the dying  hunter and the boy, and he warmed them back to life. When they were  stronger, he helped them to rekindle the fire. Then he told them to take  a few dried blackberries that they had in the lodge, and boil them in  water.    He said they must eat a portion of the blackberries, and throw the rest  at Old Man Winter when he returned. This would frighten him away, for he  was terribly afraid of blackberries.    [Illustration]    Blackberries mean sunshine and summer heat. Old Man Winter cannot stay  where they are. He never visits the earth at blackberry time.    The hunter and the little boy said they would do as they had been told.  Soon the young chieftain left the lodge, with the South Wind.    Not many days later, Old Man Winter returned, and again came rapping at  their lodge. But this time the hunter and the little boy were ready.  They threw the blackberries at him, as they had been told, and he ran in  fear to his ice lodge.    The South Wind and the young chieftain with a face like the sun were  near. They followed close upon the Old Man's track. When he was again  inside the ice lodge, the South Wind rapped gently at the door.    \"Begone!\" said the Old Man. \"No one but North Wind is welcome to my  lodge.\"    Then the South Wind breathed soft and warm upon the door of the ice  lodge, and it melted at their feet. The young chieftain passed in and  sat down by the strange fire that had no heat. The South Wind stayed  without, and sang, soft and low.    The Old Man was very angry. He raged about the lodge and ordered the  young chieftain with sunshine in his face and warmth in his breath to  depart.    \"I am great and powerful,\" said the Old Man. \"When I touch the sky, the  snow falls. When I speak, hunters hide in their lodges; animals crawl  into their holes; and birds fly in fear.    \"When my hand touches the earth, it grows cold and hard, and all life  dies. Begone! or I will make an ice man or a snow man of you.\"    But the young chieftain moved not. He only sat and smiled at the bluster  of the Old Man.    Slowly he filled a pipe, and handed it to the Old Man, saying, \"Here,  smoke with me. It will give you strength to go to your lodge in the  North Sky. It is time for you to depart. You are old, and tired, and  worn. You and North Wind have had your day. The days that are to come  belong to South Wind and to me.    \"I, too, am powerful,"]]]
