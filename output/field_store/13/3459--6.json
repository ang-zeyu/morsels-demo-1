By this time the celebration over the defeat of Hixley High had about  come to an end. The cadets were disappearing in all directions, some  going to their rooms and others to the library of the school, a large  room which was often used as a general meeting place.    Word had been passed around to a number of others, so that a crowd of  about a dozen assembled in the Rovers' rooms to take part in the  feast.    \"I'll tell you one thing we ought to do,\" said Randy. \"We ought to  square ourselves somehow with Codfish. Otherwise he may be just mean  enough to give us away.\"    \"I guess I can fix it for you,\" said Ned Lowe, who in the past had  been a bit more friendly with the sneak than any of the others  present. \"Just give me a plate of ice-cream and a piece of cake, and  I'll go and smooth it over with the little sneak.\"    \"Go ahead and do it, by all means, Ned,\" answered Andy quickly. \"I  don't begrudge the little sneak a bit of something good. It will make  him forget how his thumb hurts.\"    Ned soon departed with the ice-cream and cake, and then the others  passed around the food which had been provided. They had brought along  some paper dishes and paper drinking cups, and likewise a few tin  spoons, and the boys made themselves comfortable on various chairs  and on the beds.    \"It's all right,\" said Ned, when he returned. \"Codfish was sitting by  the window in his room wondering what he was going to do. He was  suspicious at first, thinking there was some trick about the ice-cream  or the cake, but when he found it was all right he felt better, and he  has promised to keep quiet. But just the same, we'll have to keep  quiet ourselves in here, or we'll get into trouble. I just heard the  professors going around giving orders that the celebration was now  over and everybody would have to turn in.\"    With such healthy appetites as all of the cadets possessed, the good  things to eat and drink disappeared as if by magic. Some of the boys  wanted to sing, but this had to be tabooed. Spouter, however, was  called on to make a little speech, much to his delight.    \"It's a grand occasion,\" he began. \"A grand and glorious occasion, and  one which will live long in the memory of those attending this school.  In years to come we can point with great pride to our baseball  association and how, in spite of the fact that our opponents possessed  a pitcher whose renown had traveled for many miles, and an outfield  which was classed as second to none in this district, yet our  invincible heroes----\"    \"Hurrah! Hurrah! That's the stuff, Spouter!\" interrupted Andy.    \"Did you say invisible heroes?\" queried Randy.    \"I did not,\" snorted Spouter. \"I said our invincible heroes. And as I  was about to further remark, our invincible heroes covered themselves  with a glory which will ever remain as a bright guiding star to this  glorious school, and when in days to come----\"    \"How do you know the days are to come?\" questioned Andy. \"Maybe the  days will go.\"    \"Stop your interrupting!\" cried the young speechmaker. \"And in the  days to come----\" he repeated, \"and in the days to come--er--we shall,  in the days to come----\"    \"Great Caesar, Spouter! how long are those days coming?\" queried Randy.    \"Say, how can a fellow make a speech if you're going to interrupt him  all the time?\" cried Spouter. \"If you want to listen to what I've got  to say----\"    At this moment came another interruption, but not from any of the  others present. There was a loud knock on the door, something which  brought all of the cadets to their feet in alarm.          CHAPTER IX    A TELEGRAM FROM HOME      \"I'll bet it's one of the professors!\" whispered Fred.    \"Just our confounded luck!\" grumbled Andy.    \"And when we were having such a dandy time!\" added his twin.    \"Say, you fellows get that stuff out of sight, and be quick about it!\"  commanded Jack in a low tone of voice. \"Take everything into the other  rooms.\"    With alacrity the cadets removed all traces of the spread, placing the  empty soda-water bottles and ginger-ale bottles and other things in a  closet and in the adjoining rooms.    \"Now you outside fellows get into the other rooms, and hide in the  closets if necessary,\" said Jack. \"I'll stay here with my cousins.\"    The knock on the door had been repeated several times, and Jack had  answered in a sleepy voice that he was coming. Then, when all was  ready, he threw the door open--to find himself confronted, not by one  of the professors, as he had expected, but by Bob Nixon, a fellow who  was employed as a chauffeur and a general man of all work around the  school.    \"You must sleep pretty sound,\" announced Nixon good-naturedly. \"I  thought I'd have to knock the door down to make you hear.\"    \"I told you I was coming, Nixon,\" answered Jack. \"What do you want?\"    \"Got a telegram for you,\" answered the man curtly. \"Professor Brice  asked me to bring it up to you. Say, you fellows certainly did trim up  Hixley High to-day, didn't you?\" the chauffeur went on, grinning.    \"You're right we did!\" answered Jack. He was immensely relieved to  think it was not one of the professors come to spoil their feast.  \"Where is the telegram?\"    \"Here you are,\" and Nixon held it forth.    \"Any charges?\"    \"No; it's a prepaid telegram. It was delivered with another one for  Colonel Colby. He signed for it, thinking you might be asleep. I hope  you haven't got any bad news.\"    \"I hope so myself,\" answered Jack. His heart had given a little jump  on first receiving the news, thinking that possibly something had  happened at home. He lost no time in opening the envelope, and while  he did this Fred and the twins crowded around him.    The telegram was from Jack's father, and read as follows:        \"Your Uncle Sam and I have volunteered for the army. We have      both received commissions. Tell Fred of this and break the news      gently to Mary and Martha. Uncle Tom will manage business and      remain head of Liberty Loan Committee. Colonel Colby will tell      you more.             \"RICHARD ROVER.\"    \"What is it?\" queried Fred.    \"It's great news, Fred; especially for you and for me,\" answered Jack,  whose eyes had traveled swiftly over the telegram.    Then he read the message aloud. Bob Nixon had retired, and Randy had  closed the door after him.    \"Well, what do you know about that!\" ejaculated Fred. \"My father in  the army! Good for him!\"    \"And to think my father is going, too!\" remarked the oldest of the  Rover boys. \"And he also has a commission.\" He looked at Andy and  Randy and wanted to go on, but somehow could not.    \"And they are going to make our father remain at home and take care of  the business,\" remarked Randy soberly. \"That's what I call tough  luck!\"    \"It sure is!\" declared his twin emphatically. \"I'll wager he wanted to  go to the front just as much as anybody.\"    \"Why, of course he did,\" answered Jack readily.    \"Uncle Tom is just as brave as anybody! We all know that!\" burst out  Fred. \"It was only that somebody had to stay in New York and take care  of The Rover Company.\"    \"Of course our dad was never as much of a soldier as your fathers,\"  continued Randy. \"He never became an officer at Putnam Hall. Just the  same, I'll wager he'd like to have a chance to put one over on the  Huns.\"    By this time the other cadets had come from their various hiding  places and were listening with much interest to what was being said.    \"It certainly is great news!\" declared Gif Garrison. \"I wonder if my  dad will want to go, too?\" He knew that his parent and the older  Rovers had been great chums.    \"They leave us to break the news to Mary and Martha,\" said Fred. \"That  isn't going to be a very nice job. I'm afraid the poor girls will be  all broke up.\"    \"I can't see it that way,\" answered Jack. \"They ought to feel proud to  think our fathers are brave enough to volunteer.\"    \"The telegram says that Colonel Colby will tell you more about this,\"  said Randy. \"Why don't you go over and interview him?\"    \"Maybe he has gone to bed,\" suggested Spouter.    \"I don't think so--not if he was up to receive that telegram Nixon  mentioned,\" said Jack. \"Anyhow, I'm going down and find out. Do you  want to come along, Fred?\"    \"Sure!\" was the instant response.    \"Find out if the colonel knows anything about my father,\" said Randy.  And then he added to his brother: \"We can stay here and get rid of the  remains of this feast.\"    \"All right,\" was Andy's answer. And then he added in a low tone. \"Just  the same, I can't understand why dad didn't volunteer along with Uncle  Dick and Uncle Sam,\" and his face wore anything but a pleasant  expression.    Leaving the others to dispose of what remained of the feast as they  saw fit, Jack and Fred brushed up a bit, and then lost no time in  hurrying downstairs and to the main entrance of Colby Hall. Here they  found a night watchman on guard.    \"You can't go out this time of night,\" said the watchman, following  orders.    \"We have just received this telegram,\" answered Jack, showing the  yellow slip; \"and we must confer with Colonel Colby at once. The  telegram states that he can give us some information we want.\"    \"Oh, all right, if that's the case,\" said the watchman, and allowed  them to pass.    As stated before, the colonel and his family, along with a number of  the professors, lived in a building some distance away from the Hall  proper. Crossing the campus, the boys noted a light in the colonel's  library, and presented themselves at the door of this place, and  knocked.    \"Come in,\" called out Colonel Colby.    They found the head of Colby Hall seated at his desk, looking over a  number of private papers and accounts. He looked up questioningly, and  then smiled as he recognized his visitors.    \"Got your news from home, I suppose,\" he said, after motioning them to  seats. \"I knew it was coming.\"    \"It's great news, Colonel Colby!\" cried Jack,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23319"],[0,"Mechanical Drawing Self-Taught (#11)"],[1,"ter.    [Illustration: Fig. 106.]    Figure 106 represents a drawing of a lathe centre shaded by lines, the  lines on the taper parts meeting those on the parallel part A, and  becoming more nearly parallel to the axis of the piece as the centre of  the piece is approached. The same is the case where a piece having a  curved outline is drawn, which is shown in Figure 107, where the set of  the bow-pen is gradually increased for drawing the shade lines of the  curves. The centres of the shade curves fall in each case upon a line at  a right angle to the axis of the piece, as upon the lines A, B, C, the  dotted lines showing the radius for each curve.    [Illustration: Fig. 107.]    The lines are made finer by closing the pen points by means of the screw  provided for that purpose. The pen requires for this purpose to be  cleaned of the ink that is apt to dry in it.    In Figure 108 line shading is shown applied to a ball or sphere, while  in Figure 109 it is shown applied to a pin in a socket which is shown in  section. By showing the hollow in connection with the round piece, the  difference between the two is quite clearly seen, the light falling  most upon the upper half of the pin and the lower half of the hole. This  perhaps is more clearly shown in the piece of tube in Figure 110, where  the thickness of the tube showing is a great aid to the eye. So,  likewise, the hollow or hole is more clearly seen where the piece is  shown in section, as in Figure 111, which is the case even though the  piece be taper as in the figure. If the body be bell-mouthed, as in  Figure 112, the hollow curve is readily shown by the shading; but to  line shade a hollow curve without any of these aids to the eye, as say,  to show a half of a tin tube, is a very difficult matter if the piece  is to look natural; and all that can be done is to shade the top darkly  and let the light fall mostly at and near the bottom. An example of line  shading to denote the relative distances from the eye of various  surfaces is given in Figure 113, where the surfaces most distant are the  most shaded. The flat surfaces are lined with lines of equal breadth,  the degrees of shading being governed by the width apart of the lines.    [Illustration: Fig. 108.]    [Illustration: Fig. 109.]    [Illustration: Fig. 110.]    [Illustration: Fig. 111.]    [Illustration: Fig. 112.]    [Illustration: Fig. 113.]    Line shading is often used to denote that the piece represented is to be  of wood, the shade lines being in some cases regular in combination with  regular ones, or entirely irregular, as in Figure 114.    [Illustration: Fig. 114.]          CHAPTER V.    _MARKING DIMENSIONS._      The dimensions of mechanical drawings are best marked in red ink so that  they will show plainly, and that the lines denoting the points at which  the dimension is given shall not be confounded with the lines of the  drawing.    The dimension figures should be as large as the drawing will  conveniently admit; and should be marked at every point at which a  shoulder or change of form or dimension occurs, except in the case of  straight tapers which have their dimensions marked at each end of the  taper.    In the case of a single piece standing by itself the dimension figures  may be marked all standing one way, so as to be read without changing  the position of the operator or requiring to turn the drawing around.  This is done in Figure 115, which represents the drawing of a key. The  figures are here placed outside the drawing in all cases where it can be  done, which, in the case of a small drawing, leaves the same clearer.    [Illustration: Fig. 115.]    In Figure 116 the dimensions are marked, running parallel to the  dimension for which they are given, so that all measures of length stand  lengthwise, and those of breadth across the drawing.    [Illustration: Fig. 116.]    Figure 117 represents a key with a sharp-cornered step in it. Here the  two dimensions forming the steps cannot both be coincident with it;  hence they are marked as near to it as convenient, it being understood  that they apply to the step, and not to one side of it. When the step  has a round instead of a sharp corner, the radius of the arc of the  corner may be marked, as shown in Figure 118.    [Illustration: Fig. 117.]    Figure 119 represents a key drawn in perspective, so that all the  dimensions may be marked on one view. Perspective sketches may be used  for single pieces, as they denote the shape of the piece more clearly to  the eye. On account of the skill required in their production, they are  not, however, used in mechanical drawing, except as in the case of  Patent-Office or similar drawings, where the form and construction  rather than the dimension is the information sought to be conveyed.    [Illustration: Fig. 118.]    [Illustration: Fig. 119.]          CHAPTER VI.    _THE ARRANGEMENT OF DIFFERENT VIEWS._    THE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF A MECHANICAL DRAWING.      The word _elevation_, as applied to mechanical drawing, means simply a  view; hence a side elevation is a side view, or an end elevation is an  end view.    The word _plan_ is employed in place of the word top; hence a plan view  is a top view, or a view looking down upon the top of the piece.    A _general_ view means a view showing the machine put together or  assembled, while a detail drawing is one containing a detail, as a part  of the machine or a single piece disconnected from the other parts of  the whole machine.    It is obviously desirable in a mechanical drawing to present the piece  of work in as few views as possible, but in all cases there must be a  sufficient number to permit of the dimensions in every necessary  direction to be marked on the drawing. Suppose, then, that in Figure 120  we have to represent a solid cylinder, whose length equals its diameter,  and it is obvious that both the diameter and length may be marked in the  one view given; hence, a second view, such as shown by the circle in  Figure 121, is unnecessary, except it be to distinguish the body from a  cube, in which the one view would also be sufficient whereon to mark  all the dimensions necessary to enable the piece to be made. It happens,  however, that a cube and a cylinder are the only two figures upon which  all the dimensions can be marked on one view of the piece, and as  cylindrical pieces are much more common in machine work than cubes are,  it is taken for granted that, where the pieces are cylindrical, but one  view shall be used, and that where they are cubes either two views shall  be given, or where they are square a cross shall be marked upon the  parts that are square; thus, in Figure 122, is shown a cross formed by  the lines A B across the face of the drawing, which saves making a  second view.    [Illustration: Fig. 120.]    [Illustration: Fig. 121.]    [Illustration: Fig. 122.]    [Illustration: Fig. 123.]    It would appear that under some conditions this might lead to error; as,  for example, take the piece in Figure 123, and there is nothing to  denote which is the length and which is the diameter of the piece, but  there is a certain amount of custom in such cases than will usually  determine this point; thus, the piece will be given a name, as pin or  disk, the one denoting that its diameter is less than its length, and  the other that its diameter is greater than its length. In the absence  of any such name, it would be in practice assumed that it was a pin and  not a disk; because, if it were a disk, it would either be named or  shaded, or a second view given to show its unusual form, the disk being  a more unusual form than the pin-form in mechanical structures. As an  example of the use of the cross to denote a square, we have Figure 124,  which represents a piece having a hexagon head, section _a_, _a'_, that  is rectangular, a collar _b_, a square part _c_, and a round stem _d_.  Here it will be noted that it is the rectangular part _a_, _a'_, that  renders necessary two views, and that in the absence of the cross, yet  another view would be necessary to show that part _c_ is square.    [Illustration: Fig. 124.]    [Illustration: Fig. 125.]    A rectangular piece always requires two views and sometimes three. In  Figure 125, for example, is a piece that would require a side view to  show the length and breadth, and an edge view to show the thickness.  Suppose the piece to be wedge-shaped in any direction; then another view  will be necessary, as is shown in Figs. 126 and 127. In the former the  wedge or taper is in the direction of its length, while in the latter it  is in the direction of its thickness. Outline views, however, will not  in some cases show the form of the figure, however many views be  presented. An example of this is given in Figure 128, which represents a  ring having a hexagon cross section. A sectional edge view is here  necessary in order to show the hexagonal form. Another example of this  kind, which occurs more frequently in practice, is a cupped ring such as  shown in Figure 129.    [Illustration: Fig. 126.]    [Illustration: Fig. 127.]    [Illustration: Fig. 128.]    [Illustration: Fig. 129.]      EXAMPLES.    Let it be required to draw a rectangular piece such as is shown in two  views in Figure 130, and the process for the pencil lines is as follows:    [Illustration: Fig. 130.]    With the bow-pencil set to half the required length and breadth of the  square the arcs 1, 2, 3 and 4, in Figure 131, are marked, and then the  lines 5 and 6, letting them run past the width of the arcs 3 and 4.  There is no need to pencil in lines 7 and 8, since they can be inked in  without pencilling, because it is known that they must meet the arcs 3  and 4 and terminate at the lines 5 and 6. The top and bottom lines of  the edge view are merely prolongations of lines 5 and 6; hence the lines  9 and 10 are drawn the requisite distance apart for the thickness and to  meet the top and bottom"]]]
