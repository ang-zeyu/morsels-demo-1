The reasoning that I have applied to our earth may be applied in  almost similar words to the moon. It is true that we have not any  knowledge of the internal nature of the moon at present, nor are we  able to point to any active volcanic phenomena at present in progress  there in support of the contention that the moon either has now  internal heat, or did once possess it. It is, however, impossible to  deny the evidence which the lunar craters afford as to the past  existence of volcanic activity on our satellite. Heat, therefore,  there was once in the moon; and accordingly we are enabled to conclude  that, on a retrospect through illimitable periods of time, we must  find the moon transformed from that cold and inert body she now seems  to a glowing and incandescent mass of molten material. The earth  therefore and the moon in some remote ages--not alone anterior to the  existence of life, but anterior even to the earliest periods of which  geologists have cognizance--must have been both globes of molten  materials which have consolidated into the rocks of the present epoch.    We must now revert to the tidal history of the earth-moon system. Did  we not show that there was a time when the earth and the moon--or  perhaps, I should say, the ingredients of the earth and moon--were  close together, were indeed in actual contact? We have now learned,  from a wholly different line of reasoning, that in very early ages  both bodies were highly heated. Here as elsewhere in this theory we  can make little or no attempt to give any chronology, or to harmonize  the different lines along which the course of history has run. No one  can form the slightest idea as to what the temperature of the earth  and of the moon must have been in those primeval ages when they were  in contact. It is impossible, however, to deny that they must both  have been in a very highly heated state; and everything we know of the  matter inclines us to the belief that the temperature of the  earth-moon system must at this critical epoch have been one of  glowing incandescence and fusion. It is therefore quite possible that  these bodies--the moon especially--may have then been not at all of  the form we see them now. It has been supposed, and there are some  grounds for the supposition, that at this initial stage of earth-moon  history the moon materials did not form a globe, but were disposed in  a ring which surrounded the earth, the ring being in a condition of  rapid rotation. It was at a subsequent period, according to this view,  that the substances in the ring gradually drew together, and then by  their mutual attractions formed a globe which ultimately consolidated  down into the compact moon as we now see it. I must, however,  specially draw your attention to the clearly-marked line which divides  the facts which dynamics have taught us from those notions which are  to be regarded as more or less conjectural. Interpreting the action of  the tides by the principles of dynamics, we are assured that the moon  was once--or rather the materials of the moon--in the immediate  vicinity of the earth. There, however, dynamics leaves us, and  unfortunately withholds its accurate illumination from the events  which immediately preceded that state of things.    The theory of tidal evolution which I am describing in these lectures  is mainly the work of Professor George H. Darwin of Cambridge. Much of  the original parts of the theory of the tides was due to Sir William  Thomson, and I have also mentioned how Professor Purser contributed an  important element to the dynamical theory. It is, however, Darwin who  has persistently deduced from the theory all the various consequences  which can be legitimately drawn from it. Darwin, for instance, pointed  out that as the moon is receding from us, it must, if we only look far  enough back, have been once in practical contact with the earth. It is  to Darwin also that we owe many of the other parts of a fascinating  theory, either in its mathematical or astronomical aspect; but I must  take this opportunity of saying, that I do not propose to make  Professor Darwin or any of the other mathematicians I have named  responsible for all that I shall say in these lectures. I must be  myself accountable for the way in which the subject is being treated,  as well as for many of the illustrations used, and some of the  deductions I have drawn from the subject.    It is almost unavoidable for us to make a surmise as to the cause by  which the moon had come into this remarkable position close to the  earth at the most critical epoch of earth-moon history.    With reference to this Professor Darwin has offered an explanation,  which seems so exceedingly plausible that it is impossible to resist  the notion that it must be correct. I will ask you to think of the  earth not as a solid body covered largely with ocean, but as a glowing  globe of molten material. In a globe of this kind it is possible for  great undulations to be set up. Here is a large vase of water, and by  displacing it I can cause the water to undulate with a period which  depends on the size of the vessel; undulations can be set up in a  bucket of water, the period of these undulations being dependent upon  the dimensions of the bucket. Similarly in a vast globe of molten  material certain undulations could be set up, and those undulations  would have a period depending upon the dimensions of this vibrating  mass. We may conjecture a mode in which such vibrations could be  originated. Imagine a thin shell of rigid material which just encases  the globe; suppose this be divided into four quarters, like the four  quarters of an orange, and that two of these opposite quarters be  rejected, leaving two quarters on the liquid. Now suppose that these  two quarters be suddenly pressed in, and then be as suddenly  removed--they will produce depressions, of course, on the two opposite  quarters, while the uncompressed quarters will become protuberant. In  virtue of the mutual attractions between the different particles of  the mass, an effort will be made to restore the globular form, but  this will of course rather overshoot the mark; and therefore a series  of undulations will be originated by which two opposite quarters of  the sphere will alternately shrink in and become protuberant. There  will be a particular period to this oscillation. For our globe it  would appear to be somewhere about an hour and a half or two hours;  but there is necessarily a good deal of uncertainty about this point.    We have seen how in those primitive days the earth was spinning around  very rapidly; and I have also stated that the earth might at this  very critical epoch of its history be compared with a grindstone  which is being driven so rapidly that it is on the very brink of  rupture. It is remarkable to note, that a cause tending to precipitate  a rupture of the earth was at hand. The sun then raised tides in the  earth as it does at present. When the earth revolved in a period of  some four hours or thereabouts, the high tides caused by the sun  succeeded each other at intervals of about two hours. When I speak of  tides in this respect, of course I am not alluding to oceanic tides;  these were the days long before ocean existed, at least in the liquid  form. The tides I am speaking about were raised in the fluids and  materials which then constituted the whole of the glowing earth; those  tides rose and fell under the throb produced by the sun, just as truly  as tides produced in an ordinary ocean. But now note the significant  coincidence between the period of the throb produced by the sun-raised  tides, and that natural period of vibration which belonged to our  earth as a mass of molten material. It therefore follows, that the  impulse given to the earth by the sun harmonized in time with that  period in which the earth itself was disposed to oscillate. A  well-known dynamical principle here comes into play. You see a heavy  weight hanging by a string, and in my hand I hold a little slip of  wood no heavier than a common pencil; ordinarily speaking, I might  strike that heavy weight with this slip of wood, and no effect is  produced; but if I take care to time the little blows that I give so  that they shall harmonize with the vibrations which the weight is  naturally disposed to make, then the effect of many small blows will  be cumulative, so much so, that after a short time the weight begins  to respond to my efforts, and now you see it has acquired a swing of  very considerable amplitude. In Professor Fitzgerald's address to the  British Association at Bath last autumn, he gives an account of those  astounding experiments of Hertz, in which well-timed electrical  impulses broke down an air resistance, and revealed to us ethereal  vibrations which could never have been made manifest except by the  principle we are here discussing. The ingenious conjecture has been  made, that when the earth was thrown into tidal vibrations in those  primeval days, these slight vibrations, harmonizing as they did with  the natural period of the earth, gradually acquired amplitude; the  result being that the pulse of each successive vibration increased at  last to such an extent that the earth separated under the stress, and  threw off a portion of those semi-fluid materials of which it was  composed. In process of time these rejected portions contracted  together, and ultimately formed that moon we now see. Such is the  origin of the moon which the modern theory of tidal evolution has  presented to our notice.    There are two great epochs in the evolution of the earth-moon  system--two critical epochs which possess a unique dynamical  significance; one of these periods was early in the beginning, while  the other cannot arrive for countless ages yet to come.

It finally went off, and all my art could not entice  it to return.\"    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXXII.    Soliciting Succour.      A party of a ship's crew being sent ashore on a part of the coast of  India, for the purpose of cutting wood for the ship, one of the men having  strayed from the rest was greatly frightened by the appearance of a large  lioness, who made towards him; but on her coming up, she lay down at his  feet, and looked very earnestly first at him, and then at a tree a short  distance off. After repeating her looks several times, she arose, and  proceeded onwards to the tree, looking back several times, as if wishing  the man to follow her. At length he ventured, and coming to the tree, he  perceived a huge baboon with two young cubs in her arms, which he supposed  were those of the lioness, as she couched down like a cat, and seemed to  eye them very steadfastly. The man being afraid to ascend the tree,  decided on cutting it down, and having his axe with him, he set actively  to work, when the lioness seemed most attentive to what he was doing. When  the tree fell, she sprung upon the baboon, and after tearing him in  pieces, she turned round and licked the cubs for some time. She then  turned to the man and fawned round him, rubbing her head against him in  great fondness, and in token of her gratitude for the service he had done  her. After this, she took the cubs away one by one, and the man returned  to the ship.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXXIII.    A Charitable Canary.      A pair of goldfinches who had the misfortune to be captured, together with  their nest and six young ones, were placed in a double cage, with a pair  of canaries, which had a brood of young; there was a division of wirework  between the cages. At first the goldfinches seemed careless about their  young ones; but the cock canary, attracted by their cries, forced itself  through a flaw in the wires, and began to feed them; an operation which it  continued regularly, until the goldfinches undertook the office  themselves, and rendered the humanity of the canary no longer necessary.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXXIV.    Pugnacity.      The town of Bindrabund in India is in high estimation with the pious  Hindoos, who resort to it from the most remote parts of the empire. The  town is surrounded by groves of trees, which are the residence of  innumerable apes, whose propensity to mischief is increased by the  religious respect paid to them in honour of a divinity of the Hindoo  mythology, who is represented as possessing the body of an ape. In  consequence of this superstition, such numbers of these animals are  supported by the voluntary contributions of pilgrims, that no one dares to  resist or ill-treat them. Hence, access to the town is often difficult;  for should one of the apes take a dislike to any unlucky traveller, he is  sure to be assailed by the whole community, who follow him with all the  missile weapons they can collect, as pieces of bamboo, stones, and dirt,  making at the same time a most hideous howling. Of the danger attending a  meeting with enemies of this description, the following is a melancholy  instance. Two young cavalry officers, belonging to the Bengal army, having  occasion to pass this way, were attacked by a body of apes, at whom one of  the gentlemen inadvertently fired. The alarm instantly drew the whole  body, with the fakeers, out of the place, with so much fury, that the  officers, though mounted upon elephants, were compelled to seek their  safety in flight; and in endeavouring to pass the Jumna, they both  perished.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXXV.    A Carrier's Dog.      A carrier on his way to a market town had occasion to stop at some houses  by the road side, in the way of his business, leaving his cart and horse  upon the public road, under the protection of a passenger and a trusty  dog. Upon his return he missed a led horse, belonging to a gentleman in  the neighbourhood, which he had tied to the end of the cart, and likewise  one of the female passengers. On inquiry he was informed that during his  absence the female, who had been anxious to try the mettle of the pony,  had mounted it, and that the animal had set off at full speed. The carrier  expressed much anxiety for the safety of the young woman, casting at the  same time an expressive look at his dog. Oscar observed his master's eye,  and aware of its meaning, instantly set off in pursuit of the pony, which  coming up with soon after, he made a sudden spring, seized the bridle, and  held the animal fast. Several people having observed the circumstance, and  the perilous situation of the girl, came to relieve her. Oscar, however,  notwithstanding their repeated endeavours, would not quit his hold, and  the pony was actually led into the stable with the dog, till such time as  the carrier should arrive. Upon the carrier entering the stable, Oscar  wagged his tail in token of satisfaction, and immediately relinquished the  bridle to his master.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXXVI.    Humane Society.      A large colony of rooks had resided many years in a grove on the banks of  a river. One serene evening the idle members amused themselves with  chasing each other through endless mazes, and in their flight they made  the air sound with an infinitude of discordant noises. In the midst of  these playful exertions it unfortunately happened that one rook, by a  sudden turn, struck his beak against the wing of another. The sufferer  instantly fell into the river. A general cry of distress ensued. The birds  hovered with every expression of anxiety over their distressed companion.    Animated by their sympathy, and perhaps by the language of counsel known  to themselves, he sprang into the air, and by one strong effort reached  the point of a rock that projected into the river. The joy became loud and  universal; but, alas! it was soon changed into notes of lamentation, for  the poor wounded bird, in attempting to fly towards his nest, dropped  again into the river and was drowned, amid the moans of his whole  fraternity.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXXVII.    Fox Chasing.      During a fox hunt, Reynard, being hard pressed, was reduced to the  necessity of taking refuge up a chimney of a hothouse. He was followed by  one of the hounds, who, passing through a flue upwards of fifty feet in  length, came out at the top of the chimney, but missed Reynard in its  murky recess. By this time a number of people were collected at the top of  the chimney, who let down a terrier, who soon made him come in view,  holding fast by his brush.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXXVIII.    Escape of Jengis Khan.      The Mogul and Kalmuc Tartars attribute to the white owl the preservation  of Jengis Khan, the founder of their empire; and they pay it on that  account almost divine honours. The prince, with a small army, happened to  be surprised and put to flight by his enemies. Forced to seek concealment  in a coppice, an owl settled on the bush under which he was hid. At the  sight of this animal the prince's pursuers never thought of searching the  spot, conceiving it impossible that such a bird would perch where any  human being was concealed. Jengis escaped, and ever after his countrymen  held the white owl sacred, and every one wore a plume of its feathers on  his head. The Kalmucs continue the custom to this day, at all their great  festivals; and some tribes have an idol in the form of an owl, to which  they fasten the real legs of this bird.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE LXXXIX.    A Refugee Squirrel.      A squirrel, whose bad luck it was to be captured, was lodged for safe  custody in a trap used for taking rats alive. Here he remained for several  weeks, till at length, panting for liberty, he contrived to make his  escape through a window, and repaired once more to his native fields. The  family in which he had been a sportive inmate, were not a little vexed at  the loss of their little favourite, and the servant was ordered in the  evening of the same day to remove the trap, that they might no longer be  reminded of their loss; but on proceeding to discharge his duty, he found  to his surprise that the squirrel, all wet and ruffled by the storm, had  reassumed his station, and again taken up his lodgings in a corner of the  trap.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XC.    Retaliation.      A wild stork was brought by a farmer into his poultry yard to be the  companion of a tame one, which he had long kept there; but the tame stork,  disliking a rival, fell upon the poor stranger, and beat him so  unmercifully that he was compelled to take wing, and with some difficulty  escaped. About four months afterwards, however, he returned to the poultry  yard, recovered of his wounds, and attended by three other storks, who no  sooner alighted, than they all together fell upon the tame stork, and  killed him.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XCI.    A Newsman Extraordinary.      One of the carriers of a large newspaper having become indisposed, his son  took his place; but not knowing the subscribers he was to supply, he took  for his guide a dog which had usually attended his father. The animal  trotted on a-head of the boy, and stopped at every door where the paper  was in use to be left, without making a single omission or mistake.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XCII.    The Bear Cubs.      A female bear, with two cubs, approached near a whaler, and was shot. The  cubs not attempting to escape, were taken alive. These animals, though at  first evidently very unhappy, became at length in some measure reconciled  to their situation, and being tolerably tame, were allowed occasionally to  go at large about the deck. While the ship was moored to a floe, a few  days after they were taken, one of them having a rope fastened round his  neck, was thrown overboard."]]]
