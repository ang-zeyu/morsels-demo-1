Standing now, her hands pressed tight above her golden breastplates,  Pan-at-lee watched the race for life. Now one, her older brother,  reached the summit and clinging there to something that she could not  see he lowered his body and his long tail to the father beneath him.  The latter, seizing this support, extended his own tail to the son  below--the one who had slipped back--and thus, upon a living ladder of  their own making, the three reached the summit and disappeared from  view before the Kor-ul-lul overtook them. But the latter did not  abandon the chase. On they went until they too had disappeared from  sight and only a faint shouting came down to Pan-at-lee to tell her  that the pursuit continued.    The girl knew that she must move on. At any moment now might come a  hunting party, combing the gorge for the smaller animals that fed or  bedded there.    Behind her were Es-sat and the returning party of Kor-ul-lul that had  pursued her kin; before her, across the next ridge, was the  Kor-ul-GRYF, the lair of the terrifying monsters that brought the chill  of fear to every inhabitant of Pal-ul-don; below her, in the valley,  was the country of the Ho-don, where she could look for only slavery,  or death; here were the Kor-ul-lul, the ancient enemies of her people  and everywhere were the wild beasts that eat the flesh of man.    For but a moment she debated and then turning her face toward the  southeast she set out across the gorge of water toward the  Kor-ul-GRYF--at least there were no men there. As it is now, so it was  in the beginning, back to the primitive progenitor of man which is  typified by Pan-at-lee and her kind today, of all the hunters that  woman fears, man is the most relentless, the most terrible. To the  dangers of man she preferred the dangers of the GRYF.    Moving cautiously she reached the foot of the cliff at the far side of  Kor-ul-lul and here, toward noon, she found a comparatively easy  ascent. Crossing the ridge she stood at last upon the brink of  Kor-ul-GRYF--the horror place of the folklore of her race. Dank and  mysterious grew the vegetation below; giant trees waved their plumed  tops almost level with the summit of the cliff; and over all brooded an  ominous silence.    Pan-at-lee lay upon her belly and stretching over the edge scanned the  cliff face below her. She could see caves there and the stone pegs  which the ancients had fashioned so laboriously by hand. She had heard  of these in the firelight tales of her childhood and of how the gryfs  had come from the morasses across the mountains and of how at last the  people had fled after many had been seized and devoured by the hideous  creatures, leaving their caves untenanted for no man living knew how  long. Some said that Jad-ben-Otho, who has lived forever, was still a  little boy.  Pan-at-lee shuddered; but there were caves and in them she  would be safe even from the gryfs.    She found a place where the stone pegs reached to the very summit of  the cliff, left there no doubt in the final exodus of the tribe when  there was no longer need of safeguarding the deserted caves against  invasion. Pan-at-lee clambered slowly down toward the uppermost cave.  She found the recess in front of the doorway almost identical with  those of her own tribe. The floor of it, though, was littered with  twigs and old nests and the droppings of birds, until it was half  choked. She moved along to another recess and still another, but all  were alike in the accumulated filth. Evidently there was no need in  looking further. This one seemed large and commodious. With her knife  she fell to work cleaning away the debris by the simple expedient of  pushing it over the edge, and always her eyes turned constantly toward  the silent gorge where lurked the fearsome creatures of Pal-ul-don. And  other eyes there were, eyes she did not see, but that saw her and  watched her every move--fierce eyes, greedy eyes, cunning and cruel.  They watched her, and a red tongue licked flabby, pendulous lips. They  watched her, and a half-human brain laboriously evolved a brutish  design.    As in her own Kor-ul-JA, the natural springs in the cliff had been  developed by the long-dead builders of the caves so that fresh, pure  water trickled now, as it had for ages, within easy access to the cave  entrances. Her only difficulty would be in procuring food and for that  she must take the risk at least once in two days, for she was sure that  she could find fruits and tubers and perhaps small animals, birds, and  eggs near the foot of the cliff, the last two, possibly, in the caves  themselves.  Thus might she live on here indefinitely. She felt now a  certain sense of security imparted doubtless by the impregnability of  her high-flung sanctuary that she knew to be safe from all the more  dangerous beasts, and this one from men, too, since it lay in the  abjured Kor-ul-GRYF.    Now she determined to inspect the interior of her new home. The sun  still in the south, lighted the interior of the first apartment. It was  similar to those of her experience--the same beasts and men were  depicted in the same crude fashion in the carvings on the  walls--evidently there had been little progress in the race of Waz-don  during the generations that had come and departed since Kor-ul-GRYF had  been abandoned by men. Of course Pan-at-lee thought no such thoughts,  for evolution and progress existed not for her, or her kind. Things  were as they had always been and would always be as they were.    That these strange creatures have existed thus for incalculable ages it  can scarce be doubted, so marked are the indications of antiquity about  their dwellings--deep furrows worn by naked feet in living rock; the  hollow in the jamb of a stone doorway where many arms have touched in  passing; the endless carvings that cover, ofttimes, the entire face of  a great cliff and all the walls and ceilings of every cave and each  carving wrought by a different hand, for each is the coat of arms, one  might say, of the adult male who traced it.    And so Pan-at-lee found this ancient cave homelike and familiar. There  was less litter within than she had found without and what there was  was mostly an accumulation of dust. Beside the doorway was the niche in  which wood and tinder were kept, but there remained nothing now other  than mere dust. She had however saved a little pile of twigs from the  debris on the porch. In a short time she had made a light by firing a  bundle of twigs and lighting others from this fire she explored some of  the inner rooms. Nor here did she find aught that was new or strange  nor any relic of the departed owners other than a few broken stone  dishes. She had been looking for something soft to sleep upon, but was  doomed to disappointment as the former owners had evidently made a  leisurely departure, carrying all their belongings with them. Below, in  the gorge were leaves and grasses and fragrant branches, but Pan-at-lee  felt no stomach for descending into that horrid abyss for the  gratification of mere creature comfort--only the necessity for food  would drive her there.    And so, as the shadows lengthened and night approached she prepared to  make as comfortable a bed as she could by gathering the dust of ages  into a little pile and spreading it between her soft body and the hard  floor--at best it was only better than nothing. But Pan-at-lee was very  tired. She had not slept since two nights before and in the interval  she had experienced many dangers and hardships. What wonder then that  despite the hard bed, she was asleep almost immediately she had  composed herself for rest.    She slept and the moon rose, casting its silver light upon the cliff's  white face and lessening the gloom of the dark forest and the dismal  gorge. In the distance a lion roared. There was a long silence. From  the upper reaches of the gorge came a deep bellow. There was a movement  in the trees at the cliff's foot. Again the bellow, low and ominous. It  was answered from below the deserted village. Something dropped from  the foliage of a tree directly below the cave in which Pan-at-lee  slept--it dropped to the ground among the dense shadows. Now it moved,  cautiously. It moved toward the foot of the cliff, taking form and  shape in the moonlight. It moved like the creature of a bad  dream--slowly, sluggishly. It might have been a huge sloth--it might  have been a man, with so grotesque a brush does the moon paint--master  cubist.    Slowly it moved up the face of the cliff--like a great grubworm it  moved, but now the moon-brush touched it again and it had hands and  feet and with them it clung to the stone pegs and raised itself  laboriously aloft toward the cave where Pan-at-lee slept. From the  lower reaches of the gorge came again the sound of bellowing, and it  was answered from above the village.    Tarzan of the Apes opened his eyes. He was conscious of a pain in his  head, and at first that was about all. A moment later grotesque  shadows, rising and falling, focused his arousing perceptions.  Presently he saw that he was in a cave. A dozen Waz-don warriors  squatted about, talking. A rude stone cresset containing burning oil  lighted the interior and as the flame rose and fell the exaggerated  shadows of the warriors danced upon the walls behind them.    \"We brought him to you alive, Gund,\" he heard one of them saying,  \"because never before was Ho-don like him seen. He has no tail--he was  born without one, for there is no scar to mark where a tail had been  cut off. The thumbs upon his hands and feet are unlike those of the  races of Pal-ul-don. He is more powerful than many men put together and  he attacks with the fearlessness of JA.  We brought him alive, that you  might see him before he is slain.\"    The chief rose and approached the ape-man, who closed his eyes and  feigned"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20203"],[0,"Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (#11)"],[1,"injury that might  justify the slaughter. All this seemed very reasonable. But I had  formerly been a great lover of fish, and, when this came hot out of  the frying-pan, it smelt admirably well. I balanc'd some time between  principle and inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish were  opened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought  I, \"If you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you.\" So I  din'd upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people,  returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet. So  convenient a thing is it to be a _reasonable creature_, since it  enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to  do.          V    EARLY FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA      Keimer and I liv'd on a pretty good familiar footing, and agreed  tolerably well, for he suspected nothing of my setting up. He retained  a great deal of his old enthusiasms and lov'd argumentation. We  therefore had many disputations. I used to work him so with my  Socratic method, and had trepann'd him so often by questions  apparently so distant from any point we had in hand, and yet by  degrees led to the point, and brought him into difficulties and  contradictions, that at last he grew ridiculously cautious, and would  hardly answer me the most common question, without asking first,  \"_What do you intend to infer from that_?\" However, it gave him so  high an opinion of my abilities in the confuting way, that he  seriously proposed my being his colleague in a project he had of  setting up a new sect. He was to preach the doctrines, and I was to  confound all opponents. When he came to explain with me upon the  doctrines, I found several conundrums which I objected to, unless I  might have my way a little too, and introduce some of mine.    Keimer wore his beard at full length, because somewhere in the Mosaic  law it is said, \"_Thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard_.\" He  likewise kept the Seventh day, Sabbath; and these two points were  essentials with him. I dislik'd both; but agreed to admit them upon  condition of his adopting the doctrine of using no animal food. \"I  doubt,\" said he, \"my constitution will not bear that.\" I assur'd him  it would, and that he would be the better for it. He was usually a  great glutton, and I promised myself some diversion in half starving  him. He agreed to try the practice, if I would keep him company. I did  so, and we held it for three months. We had our victuals dress'd, and  brought to us regularly by a woman in the neighborhood, who had from  me a list of forty dishes, to be prepar'd for us at different times,  in all which there was neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, and the whim  suited me the better at this time from the cheapness of it, not  costing us above eighteenpence sterling each per week. I have since  kept several Lents most strictly, leaving the common diet for that,  and that for the common, abruptly, without the least inconvenience, so  that I think there is little in the advice of making those changes by  easy gradations. I went on pleasantly, but poor Keimer suffered  grievously, tired of the project, long'd for the flesh-pots of Egypt,  and order'd a roast pig. He invited me and two women friends to dine  with him; but, it being brought too soon upon table, he could not  resist the temptation, and ate the whole before we came.    I had made some courtship during this time to Miss Read. I had a great  respect and affection for her, and had some reason to believe she had  the same for me; but, as I was about to take a long voyage, and we  were both very young, only a little above eighteen, it was thought  most prudent by her mother to prevent our going too far at present, as  a marriage, if it was to take place, would be more convenient after my  return, when I should be, as I expected, set up in my business.  Perhaps, too, she thought my expectations not so well founded as I  imagined them to be.    My chief acquaintances at this time were Charles Osborne, Joseph  Watson, and James Ralph, all lovers of reading. The two first were  clerks to an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town, Charles  Brockden; the other was clerk to a merchant. Watson was a pious,  sensible young man, of great integrity; the others rather more lax in  their principles of religion, particularly Ralph, who, as well as  Collins, had been unsettled by me, for which they both made me suffer.  Osborne was sensible, candid, frank; sincere and affectionate to his  friends; but, in literary matters, too fond of criticizing. Ralph was  ingenious, genteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent; I think I  never knew a prettier talker. Both of them were great admirers of  poetry, and began to try their hands in little pieces. Many pleasant  walks we four had together on Sundays into the woods, near  Schuylkill, where we read to one another, and conferr'd on what we  read.    [Illustration: \"Many pleasant walks we four had together\"]    Ralph was inclin'd to pursue the study of poetry, not doubting but he  might become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it, alleging that  the best poets must, when they first began to write, make as many  faults as he did. Osborne dissuaded him, assur'd him he had no genius  for poetry, and advis'd him to think of nothing beyond the business he  was bred to; that, in the mercantile way, tho' he had no stock, he  might, by his diligence and punctuality, recommend himself to  employment as a factor, and in time acquire wherewith to trade on his  own account. I approv'd the amusing one's self with poetry now and  then, so far as to improve one's language, but no farther.    On this it was propos'd that we should each of us, at our next  meeting, produce a piece of our own composing, in order to improve by  our mutual observations, criticisms, and corrections. As language and  expression were what we had in view, we excluded all considerations of  invention by agreeing that the task should be a version of the  eighteenth Psalm, which describes the descent of a Deity. When the  time of our meeting drew nigh, Ralph called on me first, and let me  know his piece was ready. I told him I had been busy, and, having  little inclination, had done nothing. He then show'd me his piece for  my opinion, and I much approv'd it, as it appear'd to me to have great  merit. \"Now,\" says he, \"Osborne never will allow the least merit in  anything of mine, but makes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy. He is  not so jealous of you; I wish, therefore, you would take this piece,  and produce it as yours; I will pretend not to have had time, and so  produce nothing. We shall then see what he will say to it.\" It was  agreed, and I immediately transcrib'd it, that it might appear in my  own hand.    We met; Watson's performance was read; there were some beauties in it,  but many defects. Osborne's was read; it was much better; Ralph did it  justice; remarked some faults, but applauded the beauties. He himself  had nothing to produce. I was backward; seemed desirous of being  excused; had not had sufficient time to correct, etc.; but no excuse  could be admitted; produce I must. It was read and repeated; Watson  and Osborne gave up the contest, and join'd in applauding it. Ralph  only made some criticisms, and propos'd some amendments; but I  defended my text. Osborne was against Ralph, and told him he was no  better a critic than poet, so he dropt the argument. As they two went  home together, Osborne expressed himself still more strongly in favor  of what he thought my production; having restrain'd himself before, as  he said, lest I should think it flattery. \"But who would have  imagin'd,\" said he, \"that Franklin had been capable of such a  performance; such painting, such force, such fire! He has even  improv'd the original. In his common conversation he seems to have no  choice of words; he hesitates and blunders; and yet, good God! how he  writes!\" When we next met, Ralph discovered the trick we had plaid  him, and Osborne was a little laughed at.    This transaction fixed Ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet. I  did all I could to dissuade him from it, but he continued scribbling  verses till _Pope_ cured him.[35] He became, however, a pretty good  prose writer. More of him hereafter. But, as I may not have occasion  again to mention the other two, I shall just remark here, that Watson  died in my arms a few years after, much lamented, being the best of  our set. Osborne went to the West Indies, where he became an eminent  lawyer and made money, but died young. He and I had made a serious  agreement, that the one who happen'd first to die should, if possible,  make a friendly visit to the other, and acquaint him how he found  things in that separate state. But he never fulfill'd his promise.        [35] \"In one of the later editions of the _Dunciad_ occur      the following lines:           'Silence, ye wolves! while Ralph to Cynthia howls,         And makes night hideous--answer him, ye owls.'        To this the poet adds the following note:        'James Ralph, a name inserted after the first editions,      not known till he writ a swearing-piece called _Sawney_,      very abusive of Dr. Swift, Mr. Gay, and myself.'\"          VI    FIRST VISIT TO LONDON      The governor, seeming to like my company, had me frequently to his  house, and his setting me up was always mention'd as a fixed thing. I  was to take with me letters recommendatory to a number of his friends,  besides the letter of credit to furnish me with the necessary money  for purchasing the press and types, paper, etc. For these letters I  was appointed to call at different times, when they were to be ready;  but a future time was still named. Thus he went on till the ship,  whose departure too had been several times postponed, was on the point  of sailing. Then, when I call'd to take my leave and receive the  letters, his secretary, Dr. Bard,"]]]
