These conditions may be produced by a primary  irritation of the nerve centers of the brain from the effects of heat,  as is seen in thermic fever, or sunstroke, or by the entrance into the  blood stream of disease-producing organisms or their chemical products,  as in anthrax, rinderpest, influenza, etc.    There are times when it is difficult to distinguish between the  existence of fever as a disease and a temporary feverish condition which  is the result of excessive work. Like the condition of congestion of the  lungs, which is normal up to a certain degree in the lungs of a race  horse after a severe race, and morbid when it produces more than  temporary phenomena or when it causes distinct lesions, the temperature  may rise from physiological causes as much as four degrees, so fever,  or, as it is better termed, a feverish condition, may follow any work or  other employment of energy in which excessive tissue change has taken  place; but if the consequences are ephemeral, and no recognizable lesion  is apparent, it is not considered morbid. This condition, however, may  predispose to severe organic disturbance and local inflammations which  will cause disease, as an animal in this condition is liable to take  cold and develop lung fever or a severe enteritis, if chilled or  otherwise exposed.    Fever in all animals is characterized by the same general phenomena, but  we find the intensity of the symptoms modified by the species of animals  affected, by the races which subdivide the species, by the families  which form groups of the races, and by certain conditions in individuals  themselves. For example, a pricked foot in a Thoroughbred may cause  intense fever, while the same injury in the foot of a Clydesdale may  scarcely cause a visible general symptom. In the horse, fever produces  the following symptoms:    The normal body temperature, which varies from 99 deg. to 100 deg. F., is  elevated from 1 deg. to 9 deg.. A temperature of 102 deg. or 103 deg. F. is moderate  fever, 104 deg. to 105 deg. F. is high, and 106 deg. F. and over is excessive. The  temperature is accurately measured by means of a clinical thermometer  inserted in the rectum.    This elevation of temperature can readily be felt by the hand placed in  the mouth of the animal, or in the rectum, and in the cleft between the  hind legs. It is usually appreciable at any point over the surface of  the body and in the expired air emitted from the nostrils. The ears and  cannons are often as hot as the rest of the body, but are sometimes  cold, which denotes a debility in the circulation and irregular  distribution of the blood. The pulse, which in a healthy horse is felt  beating about 42 to 48 times in the minute, is increased to 60, 70, 90,  or even 100. The respirations are increased from 14 or 16 to 24, 30, 36,  or even more. With the commencement of a fever the horse usually has  diminished appetite, or it may have total loss of appetite if the fever  is excessive. There is, however, a vast difference among horses in this  regard. With the same degree of elevation of temperature one horse may  lose its appetite entirely, while another, usually of the more common  sort, will eat at hay throughout the course of the fever, and will even  continue to eat oats or other grains. Thirst is usually increased, but  the animal desires only a small quantity of water at a time, and in most  cases of fever a bucket of water should be kept standing before the  patient, which may be allowed to drink ad libitum. The skin becomes dry  and the hairs stand on end. Sweating is almost unknown in the early  stage of fevers, but frequently occurs later in their course, when an  outbreak of warm sweat is often a most favorable symptom. The mucous  membranes, which are most easily examined in the conjunctivae of the eyes  and inside of the mouth, change color if the fever is an acute one;  without alteration of blood the mucous membranes become of a rosy or  deep-red color at the outset; if the fever is attended with distinct  alteration of the blood, as in influenza, and at the end of two or three  days in severe cases of pneumonia or other extensive inflammatory  troubles the mucous membranes are tinged with yellow, which may even  become a deep ocher in color, the result of the decomposition of the  blood corpuscles and the freeing of their coloring matter, which acts as  a stain. At the outset of a fever the various glands are checked in  their secretions, the salivary glands fail to secrete the saliva, and we  find the surface of the tongue and inside of the cheeks dry and covered  with a brownish, bad-smelling deposit. The excretion from the liver and  intestinal glands is diminished and produces an inactivity of the  digestive organs which causes a constipation. If this is not remedied at  an early period, the undigested material acts as an irritant, and later  we may have it followed by an inflammatory process, producing a severe  diarrhea.    The excretion from the kidneys is sometimes at first entirely  suppressed. It is always considerably diminished, and what urine is  passed is dark in color, undergoes ammoniacal change rapidly, and  deposits quantities of salts. At a later period the diminished excretion  may be replaced by an excessive excretion, which aids in carrying off  waste products and usually indicates an amelioration of the fever.    While the ears, cannons, and hoofs of a horse suffering from fever are  usually found hot, they may frequently alternate from hot to cold, or be  much cooler than they normally are. This latter condition usually  indicates great weakness on the part of the circulatory system.    It is of the greatest importance, as an aid in diagnosing the gravity of  an attack of fever and as an indication in the selection of its mode of  treatment, to recognize the exact cause of a febrile condition in the  horse. In certain cases, in very nervous animals, in which fever is the  result of nerve influence, a simple anodyne, or even only quiet with  continued care and nursing, will sometimes be sufficient to diminish it.  When fever is the result of local injury, the cure of the cause produces  a cessation in the constitutional symptoms. When it is the result of a  pneumonia or other severe parenchymatous inflammation, it usually lasts  for a definite time, and subsides with the first improvement of the  local trouble, but in these cases we constantly have exacerbations of  fever due to secondary inflammatory processes, such as the formation of  small abscesses, the development of secondary bronchitis, or the death  of a limited quantity of tissue (gangrene).    In specific cases, such as influenza, strangles, and septicemia, there  is a definite poison in the blood-vessel system and carried to the heart  and to the nervous system, which produces a peculiar irritation, usually  lasting for a specific period, during which the temperature can be but  slightly diminished by any remedy.    In cases attended with complications, the diagnosis at times becomes  still more difficult, as at the end of a case of influenza which becomes  complicated with pneumonia. The high temperature of the simple  inflammatory disease may be grafted on that of the specific trouble, and  the determination of the cause of the fever, as between the two, is  therefore frequently a difficult matter but an important one, as upon it  depends the mode of treatment.    Any animal suffering from fever, whatever the cause, is much more  susceptible to attacks of local inflammation, which become complications  of the original disease, than are animals in sound health. In fever we  have the tissues and the walls of the blood vessels weakened, we have an  increased current of more or less altered blood flowing through the  vessels and stagnating in the capillaries, which need but an exciting  cause to transform the passive congestion of fever into an active  congestion and acute inflammation. These conditions become still more  distinct when the fever is accompanied with a decided deterioration in  the blood itself, as is seen in influenza, septicemia, and at the  termination of severe pneumonias.    Fever, with its symptoms of increased temperature, acceleration of the  pulse, acceleration of respiration, dry skin, diminished secretions,  etc., must be considered as an indication of organic disturbance. This  organic disturbance may be the result of local inflammation or other  irritants acting through the nerves on nerve centers, alterations of the  blood, in which a poison is carried to the nerve centers, or direct  irritants to the nerve centers themselves, as in cases of heat stroke,  injury to the brain, etc.    The treatment of fever depends upon its cause. One of the important  factors in treatment is absolute quiet. This may be obtained by placing  a sick horse in a box stall, away from other animals and extraneous  noises and sheltered from excessive light and drafts of air. Anodynes,  belladonna, hyoscyamus, and opium act as antipyretics simply by quieting  the nervous system. As an irritant exists in the blood in most cases of  fever, any remedy which will favor the excretion of foreign elements  from it will diminish this cause. We therefore use diaphoretics to  stimulate the sweat and excretions from the skin; diuretics to favor the  elimination of matter by the kidneys; cholagogues and laxatives to  increase the action of the liver and intestines, and to drain from these  important organs all the waste material which is aiding to choke up and  congest their rich plexuses of blood vessels. The heart becomes  stimulated to increased action at the outset of a fever, but this does  not indicate increased strength; on the contrary, it indicates the  action of an irritant to the heart that will soon weaken it. It is,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23434"],[0,"An Elementary Study of Insects (#11)"],[1," any  place where plants or animals live. They do not waste time building or  manufacturing a complicated nest like wasps and bees, so when food is  scare, or for other reasons they need to move they simply \"pack up\" and  migrate. This, together with the fact that they feed on almost every  imaginable kind of plant and animal material, accounts in part for the  fact that they are the rulers of the insect world.      STUDIES AND OBSERVATIONS    It is easy to study the out-door life of ants, but it is most difficult  to follow their activities in the nest. Go into the field or out on the  school grounds and watch along paths or bare spots for ants. Soon red or  black fellows will be seen hurrying along after food; ants are always in  a hurry when they are after food. Follow them and watch them catch and  carry home small insects. If they do not find worms or other small  insects, drop a small caterpillar near one of them and see what happens.  Can they drag away a caterpillar as large as themselves? Some of them  may be after honey dew, fruit juice or other material of this nature and  they should be observed collecting it. Ants collect about plants or  shrubs which are overrun with green lice, and feed on a sweet liquid  which the lice produce. Watch them collect the honey dew from the lice.  Do they injure the lice? Can you see the two short tubes on the back of  the louse?    Locate an ant nest or hill. Observe the workers carrying out small  pellets of earth or gravels. Is the earth they bring out the same color  as the surface soil? How deep may they go to get it? Do they move about  as if they were in a hurry? Who sends them out with the earth? Why do  they bring it out? Is it dropped as soon as the ant comes out of the  hole or is it carried some distance? The small ant found along paths  usually makes a small ridge all the way around the entrance. While some  of the ants are making the nest, others are collecting food. Watch for  some of these and see what they bring. Do they stop to eat before going  down into the nest? Dig into a large ant hill and see what can be found.  Describe briefly what is found. Do you find any small soft grubs and  oval cocoons? These are the young ants and they are perfectly helpless  and must be fed, bathed and cared for by the workers or nurses. The  workers pick these up between their pinchers and carry them away when  the nest is disturbed. Do the workers fight to protect the nest? Collect  some of the workers which are carrying away the young and keep them in a  jar with bits of bark and see what they do with the young.    Describe briefly what you are able to find out about ant life and  behavior; also make drawings of an ant, the young and a nest.           *       *       *       *       *        \"_A pensy ant, right trig and clean,      Came ae day whidding o'er the green,      Where, to advance her pride, she saw      A Caterpillar, moving slaw.      'Good ev'n t' ye, Mistress Ant,' said he;      'How's a' at home? I'm blyth to s' ye!'      The saucy ant view'd him wi' scorn,      Nor wad civilities return;      But gecking up her head, quoth she,      'Poor animal! I pity thee;      Wha scarce can claim to be a creature,      But some experiment O' Nature,      Whase silly shape displeased her eye,      And thus unfinished was flung bye.

But tent neist time the Ant came by,      The worm was grown a Butterfly;      Transparent were his wings and fair,      Which bare him flight'ring through the air.      Upon a flower he stapt his flight,      And thinking on his former slight,      Thus to the Ant himself addrest:      'Pray, Madam, will ye please to rest?      And notice what I now advise:      Inferiors ne'er too much despise,      For fortune may gie sic a turn,      To raise aboon ye what ye scorn:      For instance, now I spread my wing      In air, while you're a creeping thing!'_\"                                            --ALLAN RAMSAY.
