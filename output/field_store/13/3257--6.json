The believers are free to paint, write or compose as their  talents guide them. If music is written incorporating the Sacred Writings,  the friends are free to make use of it, but it should never be considered  a requirement at Baha'i meetings to have such music. The farther away the  friends keep from any set forms, the better, for they must realize that  the Cause is absolutely universal, and what might seem a beautiful  addition to their mode of celebrating a Feast, etc., would perhaps fall on  the ears of people of another country as unpleasant sounds--and vice  versa. As long as they have music for its own sake it is all right, but  they should not consider it 'Baha'i Music'.\"            136: NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES (AUTHORITY OF)      \"I wish to reaffirm in clear and categorical language, the principle  already enunciated upholding the supreme authority of the National  Assembly in all matters that affect the interests of the Faith in that  land. There can be no conflict of authority, no duality under any form or  circumstances in any sphere of Baha'i jurisdiction whether local, national  or international. The National Assembly, however, although the sole  interpreter of its Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, is directly and  morally responsible if it allows any body or institution within its  jurisdiction to abuse its privileges or to decline in the exercise of its  rights and privileges. It is the trusted guardian and the mainspring of  the manifold activities and interests of every national community in the  Baha'i world. It constitutes the sole link that binds these communities to  the International House of Justice, the supreme administrative body in the  Dispensation of Baha'u'llah.\"            137: N.S.A. INVOLVEMENT (APPEALS PROHIBITED)      \"Anything whatsoever affecting the interests of the Cause and in which the  National Assembly as a body is involved should, if regarded as  unsatisfactory by Local Assemblies and individual believers, be  immediately referred to the National Assembly itself. Neither the general  body of the believers, nor any Local Assembly, nor even the delegates to  the annual Convention, should be regarded as having any authority to  entertain appeals against the decision of the National Assembly. Should  the matter be referred to the Guardian it will be his duty to consider it  with the utmost care and to decide whether the issues involved justify him  to consider it in person, or to leave it entirely to the discretion of the  National Assembly.    \"This administrative principle which the Guardian is now restating and  emphasizing is so clear, so comprehensive and simple that no  misunderstanding as to its application, he feels, can possibly arise.  There are no exceptions whatever to this rule, and the Guardian would  deprecate any attempt to elaborate or dwell any further upon this  fundamental and clearly enunciated principle.\"            138: N.S.A.'S JURISDICTION OVER COMMITTEES (AUTHORITY OF)      \"The N.S.A.'s final jurisdiction over both the National Teaching Committee  and the Regional Teaching Committees is certainly indisputable, and is of  the same nature and character as the authority to which it is entitled  over all other national committees.\"            139: NEW ASSEMBLIES (FORMATION OF)      \"Regarding the formation of Local Assemblies, the Guardian does not advise  any departure from the principle that every civil community should have  its own independent Assembly.\"            140: NEW ASSEMBLIES (RESIDENCE QUALIFICATIONS)      \"In connection with the formation of new Assemblies and the maintenance of  their Assembly status, the Guardian wishes to reaffirm the general  principle that only those who reside within the city limits of any given  locality have the right to either vote or be elected as member of the  Assembly, even though this may involve frequent dissolution of the  Assembly owing to insufficient number of members. It will, on the other  hand, serve as a stimulus to those outside these limits to establish a  group and eventually an Assembly of their own. This principle should be  closely adhered to, otherwise it will lead to confusion and overlapping.\"            141: NINE (NUMBER)      \"The number nine, which in itself is the number of perfection, is  considered by the Baha'is as sacred, because it is symbolic of the  perfection of the Baha'i Revelation which constitutes the ninth in the  line of existing religions, the latest and fullest Revelation which  mankind has ever known. The eighth is the religion of the Bab and the  remaining seven are: Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism,  Christianity, Islam, and the religion of the Sabaeans. These religions are  not the only true religions that have appeared in the world but are the  only ones still existing. There have always been Divine Prophets and  Messengers, to many of whom the Qur'an refers. But the only ones existing  are those mentioned above.\"    \"The Guardian feels that with intellectuals and students of religion the  question of exactly which are the nine existing religions is  controversial, and it would be better to avoid it. He does not want the  friends to be rigid in these matters, but use their judgment and tact,  sometimes one statement is exactly the right thing for one type of mind  and the wrong thing for another.    \"Strictly speaking the 5-pointed star is the symbol of our Faith, as used  by the Bab and explained by Him. But the Guardian does not feel it is wise  or necessary to complicate our explanations of the Temple by adding this.\"    \"Nine is the highest digit, hence symbolizes comprehensiveness,  culminations; also, the reason it is used in the Temple's form is because  9 has exact numerical value of 'Baha (in the numerology connected with the  Arabic alphabet) and 'Baha is the name of the Revealer of our Faith,  Baha'u'llah. The 9-pointed star is not a part of the teachings of our  Faith, but only used as an emblem representing '9'. In telling people of  the            9: RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD, THAT IS 'EXISTING RELIGIONS, WE SHOULD NOT      give this as the reason the Temple has nine sides. This may have been an  idea of the architect, and a very pleasing idea, which can be mentioned in  passing, but the Temple has 9 sides because of the association of 9 with  perfection, unity and 'Baha.\"            142: ORIENTALS      \"As regards those Persian or Oriental non-believers who become genuinely  interested in the Cause in America, they can be admitted to study classes,  but every care should be taken by the Assemblies to fully test their  sincerity and the genuineness of their desire to join the Community before  they are given the necessary facilities that will enable them eventually  to be regarded as voting members of the Faith.\"            143: ORIENTALS (ASSOCIATION WITH)      \"In this connection, the Guardian wishes to draw once more your attention  to the all-importance of his instructions to the Western believers  regarding association with Orientals. The friends in the West must be wide  awake, and be extremely cautious when dealing with Easterners,  particularly with those who in the name of the Cause desire to satisfy  their own desires and ambitions. The first step which they should take in  protecting themselves against such mischief-makers is to insist that they  should obtain proper credentials from the Assembly of the locality in  which they live. This measure, he feels, is absolutely essential and there  can be no exception whatever to it.\"            144: PACIFISM (BAHA'I VIEW OF)      \"With reference to the absolute pacifists, or conscientious objectors to  war; their attitude, judged from the Baha'i standpoint is quite  anti-social and due to its exaltation of the individual conscience leads  inevitably to disorder and chaos in society. Extreme pacifists are thus  very close to the anarchists, in the sense that both of these groups lay  an undue emphasis on the rights and merits of the individual. The Baha'i  conception of social life is essentially based on the subordination of the  individual will to that of society. It neither suppresses the individual  nor does it exalt him to the point of making him an anti-social creature,  a menace to society. As in everything, it follows the 'golden mean'. The  only way that society can function is for the minority to follow the will  of the majority.    \"The other main objection to the conscientious objectors is that their  method of establishing peace is too negative. Non-cooperation is too  passive a philosophy to become an effective way for social reconstruction.  Their refusal to bear arms can never establish peace. There should first  be a spiritual revitalization which nothing, except the Cause of God, can  effectively bring to every man's heart.\"            145: PEACE      \"...I might add that he does not believe any radiations of thought or  healing, from any group, is going to bring peace. Prayer, no doubt, will  help the world, but what it needs is to accept Baha'u'llah's system so as  to build up the World Order on a new foundation, a divine foundation!\"            146: PHOTOGRAPHS      \"It is quite important that the Greatest Name or a picture of 'Abdu'l-Baha  be placed in a dignified position. They should not be placed on the floor  nor, on the other hand, should they be held above the heads of the people  in the photograph. It would seem that the proper position would be for  them to be held about chest height.\"            147: PILGRIM'S NOTES      \"Regarding the notes taken by pilgrims at Haifa. The Guardian has stated  that he is unwilling to sign the notes of any pilgrim, in order that the  literature consulted by the believers shall not be unduly extended... This  means that the notes of pilgrims do"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19271"],[0,"Dawn of a New Day (#11)"],[1,"Assembly will meet as regularly  and as frequently as possible in order to maintain the efficiency of its  functioning and to raise the standard and to widen the scope of its  activities.    The important decision of the N.S.A. relative to the registration of the  Bombay Assembly as a recognized religious body is, in the Guardian's  opinion, a leading step towards the official recognition of the Cause as  an independent religious organisation by the Government authorities both  in India and Burma. He would strongly urge, however, that the constitution  to be adopted should not only be based on that which the New York Assembly  has adopted for its own registration but should reproduce it identically  without any change whatsoever but with due consideration to all local and  geographical differences.    The Guardian wishes also to stress the necessity of completing the Urdu  and the Hindi translations of Dr. Esslemont's 'New Era'. He has already,  in several communications addressed to Mr. N.R. Vakil, requested him to  take all the necessary steps in this direction. May the decision of the  N.S.A. on this point hasten and insure the completion of this task to  which the Guardian has so repeatedly drawn the attention of the friends.    December 27, 1933          Bedrock of Baha'i Administrative Order      The Guardian was very pleased to learn of the progress done by the Indian  N.S.A. in its efforts to consolidate, widen and maintain the scope of its  national activities. The difficulties in your way are tremendous. The  differences of language and of social and intellectual background do,  undoubtedly, render the work somewhat difficult to carry out and may  temporarily check the efficient and smooth working of the national  administrative machinery of the Faith. They, nevertheless, impart to the  deliberations of the National Assembly a universality which they would be  otherwise lacking, and give to its members a breadth of view which is  their duty to cultivate and foster. It is not uniformity which we should  seek in the formation of any national or local assembly. For the bedrock  of the Baha'i administrative order is the principle of unity in diversity,  which has been so strongly and so repeatedly emphasized in the writings of  the Cause. Differences which are not fundamental and contrary to the basic  teachings of the Cause should be maintained, while the underlying unity of  the administrative order should be at any cost preserved and insured.  Unity, both of purpose and of means is, indeed, indispensable to the safe  and speedy working of every Assembly, whether local or national.    Another factor which, in the Guardian's opinion, is essential to the  development of your N.S.A. is the holding of frequent meetings. Although  the members are stationed at great distances from one another, yet they  can communicate through correspondence. It is not necessary that all the  members should be present in all the sessions. Those who for some reason  or another are unable to attend in person the meetings of the N.S.A., can  express their views in a written form and send them to the Assembly. The  main point is that your national activities should not be let to suffer in  any way, and its work be retarded and postponed because of such  necessarily unimportant and secondary considerations.    [From the Guardian:]    I wish to assure you in person of my prayers for the removal of the  difficulties, domestic and otherwise, that beset your path in these days.  I will supplicate the Almighty to guide you in your manifold and valuable  activities in the service of His Faith, to cheer your heart, and to deepen  your understanding of the fundamentals of His Faith. You should  concentrate your efforts at the present time on whatever will, in your  opinion reinforce the basis and extend the influence, of the  administrative institutions and the teaching activities of the Faith. The  Cause will, no doubt, surmount the obstacles that now hinder its growth  and will establish its ascendency in the fulness of time and at the  appointed hour. We should persevere and never feel disheartened.    January 2, 1934          Accept Justified Resignation      The N.S.A. cannot refuse accepting a resignation when it is well  justified, and when it is done not with the purpose of shirking  responsibility but with the intention of giving a chance to others to  prove themselves worthy of occupying responsible posts in the  administrative field.    April 10, 1934          Revival of the Spirit of Fellowship      The resolutions passed by your N.S.A. at its recent meeting at Delhi have  given him sufficient evidence of the new spirit that has come to animate  its members. It is his hope that through the continued development of that  same spirit your Assembly will be enabled to do more effective work for  the Cause.    [From the Guardian:]    The splendid resolutions passed by the National Assembly at Delhi are  admirable and indicate the revival of the spirit of fellowship and  determination to consolidate the administrative basis of the Faith in  India and Burma. I am eagerly anticipating to hear the news that these  resolutions have been duly carried out, particularly regarding the  incorporation of the Bombay Assembly and the translation and publication  of the New Era into Urdu and Sindhi.    May 29, 1934          Changes in Membership of Baha'i Assemblies      He fully agrees with the Bombay Assembly that they are in need of an  English-speaking Secretary, in view of the increasingly large volume of  correspondence they receive in English. But he feels that this emergency  does not afford sufficient justification to any believer or Assembly to  make the slightest departure from the recognized and duly established  principles governing the election of the members of any Assembly, whether  local or national. If the Bombay Assembly feels it necessary to have a  Secretary for the English correspondence they can appoint an Assistant  Secretary from outside the Assembly. It is only the body of Baha'i  electors who can bring about any change in the membership of the Assembly,  and this during the Ridvan feast which for all administrative purposes is  the beginning of the Baha'i Year.    June 5, 1934          Intensify Teaching Throughout India      He notes with deep satisfaction the important steps taken by your N.S.A.  for intensifying the spread of the Cause throughout India and Burma, and  particularly values the encouragement and help which they have extended to  dear Mr. Pritam Singh in his teaching tour in Northern India. He is  praying from the depth of his heart for the success of this trip, as well  as for the speedy and complete materialisation of the plans which you, in  close collaboration with your fellow-members in the National Assembly, are  initiating for the wider diffusion of the teachings throughout your  country.    He fully appreciates, indeed, the suggestions you have offered him in this  connection. The lack of competent teachers is no doubt a serious obstacle  facing the Indian believers at present. But it is by no means the most  difficult problem with which they have to deal. The essential is that all  the friends, without any exception whatever, should realise the full  measure of the responsibility which Baha'u'llah has placed on them for  teaching far and wide His Message. It is only through such an awakened  consciousness of their heavy and sacred responsibilities and duties that  the believers can hope to effectively promote and safeguard the interests  of the Cause. The Baha'i era is thus the age of individual  responsibility--the age in which everyone is called to consider the spread  of the Cause as his most sacred and vital obligation.    This is the point which the Guardian wishes your Assembly to emphasize in  connection with the problem of teaching in India. He hopes that through  their collective efforts a new zeal for teaching will come to animate the  entire community of the believers throughout India and Burma.    Shoghi Effendi approves of your suggestion to utilize the fifty pounds  which he sent to you, for the publication of the Bengali translation of  the \"New Era\". He hopes that this work will soon be ready for  distribution.    November 25, 1934 \"Kitab-i-Iqan\" Translated in Many Languages    I am directed by the Guardian to request you to kindly mail to his address  five copies of the Urdu translation of the \"Kitab-i-Iqan\" (Book of  Certitude).    You will certainly be interested to know that the Iqan has already been  translated and published into Russian, English, French, German, Chinese,  Albanian, Urdu and Braille. Steps have also been taken for its rendering  and publication into Arabic, Armenian, Swedish and Danish.    November 27, 1934          Persecution of the Baha'is in Iran      The persecutions from which the Persian friends are now suffering  represent, indeed, the culmination in the long and nation-wide campaign  which the authorities in that country have during the last two years  launched against the Faith. In many of its aspects this campaign is  reminiscent of the persecutions suffered by the early Babis,...    The first incident which led to this outburst of fierce antagonism on the  part of the Government was in connection with the Tarbiat Schools in  Tehran. The school authorities having, after due consultation with the  N.S.A. and in strict conformity with the principle governing the  observance of Baha'i holidays, decided to close the schools on the  occasion of the celebration of the anniversary of Bab's martyrdom, the  authorities in the capital immediately issued orders that the schools be  permanently closed, and that also no public meetings of any kind be held  by the believers. This has been done in spite of the fact that other  religious communities, such as the Muslims and the Zoroastrians, are  allowed to celebrate their own feasts, and as such enjoy"]]]
