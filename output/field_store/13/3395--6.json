(_M._)]    [Footnote 93: The Commentator (referring to Vasishtha and Gautama)  reads this,--the finder shall take a sixth, the monarch the  residue--such being the converse of the plain language used.]    [Footnote 94: Manu ch. 8, sl. 40: in which, to the monarch who fails  to make restitution is imputed the guilt of the thief. Sir Wm. Jones'  translation of this passage is too indefinite.]    [Footnote 95: _i. e._ The brahman borrower gives two hundredths,  the kshattriya three hundredths, &c. (_M._) But Jagannat'ha, in his  Digest (Colebrooke, B. 1, c. 1, s. 28) interprets the text inversely,  _viz._ the brahman creditor takes two _suvarnas_ in a hundred, the  kshattriya three, and so on.

(_M._)]    [Footnote 115: _i. e._ marries.]    [Footnote 116: This is the reading sanctioned by the Commentator,  _viz._ _putro' nanya'sritadravyah_, signifying, that, on failure of  those before designated, a son who would be otherwise incapable, by  reason of blindness, &c. is to be deemed capable. Another reading may  be, as suggested by the Commentator, _putro nu'aya'sritadraoyah_, \"not  the son whose paternal estate another holds,\" which is adopted by  Colebrooke, and by his author, Jagannat'ha, (Dig. B. 1, ch. 5, s.  171)]    [Footnote 117: _e.g._ \"Give such a one money, he will not deceive you;  he is the son of such a one.\" (_M._)]    [Footnote 118: \"If he do not pay, I will.\" (_M._)]    [Footnote 119: Manu ch. 8, sl. 160-162.]    [Footnote 120: metaphorically in the original \"If all stand under the  same shade:\" The Commentator explains.]    [Footnote 121: lit. \"publicly.\"]    [Footnote 122: as of a field, garden, &c.

(_M._)]    [Footnote 126: _charitrabandhakam. charitra_ (the mode or the subject  of pledge) is defined by the Commentator to be either, moral worth,  or, the merit earned by performance of religious rites, such as  ablution in the Ganges, &c. We have rendered it as the mode, not  subject, of pledge. See Jagannat'ha's Digest (Colebrooke), Bk. 1, ch.  3, sec. 2, text cxxiv.]    [Footnote 127: Receiving on one's plighted word (_satyankara_)  signifies, borrowing on a solemn promise to repay. The application  is,--where, at the time of handing over the pledge, it was expressly  declared by the debtor, that the loan should be repaid, even if  increased to two-fold the original sum, and the pledge not abandoned;  in such case also, the debtor should be made to repay twice the amount  of the debt contracted.(_M._)    The Commentator adds another meaning or application of the latter  words of this sloka, in which, reciting the first part, _viz._,  pledging upon the guarantee of character, or, a pledge of religious  merit, he goes on to say--It is here laid down, that one who receives  on his word, _scil._ words ratifying a bargain of sale and purchase,  &c., for instance, receiving a gold ring, &c., as earnest, shall be  made to repay twice the value of the thing so given, on breach of the  contract: if the party depositing the ring, &c., break off the  bargain, he forfeits what he gave as earnest; if the other party break  off, he is to be compelled to refund double the value of the earnest  received by him.]    [Footnote 128: punishable as a thief.

(_M._)]    [Footnote 134: _anvahita._ We have followed the Commentator in  translating this indefinite term.]    [Footnote 135: This qualification too is the Commentator's. The term  used _nyasa_ is simply, a deposit.]    [Footnote 136: which are those given in the presence of (_i. e._  personally to) the depositee. (_M._)]    [Footnote 137: such as gold &c. given to be worked (_M._)]    [Footnote 138: _tapaswi_, the third in rank of the Hindu religious  orders.]    [Footnote 139: The four objects of living being, in the creed of the  Hindu, virtue, wealth, pleasure, and final liberation of the soul.]    [Footnote 140: Manu, ch. 8, sl. 62, 63.]    [Footnote 141: The terms used are _jati_ and _varna_ which are  somewhat ambiguous; but the sense is evidently as rendered, and is so  explained by the Commentator. Manu adds,--Women should be witnesses  for women, ch. 8, sl. 68.]    [Footnote 142: _i. e._ if the regular and more appropriate witnesses  are not available. (_M._)    After sloka 69 the Calcutta edition has the following:--Those learned  in the Vedas, ascetics, the aged, devotees, and the like, are  incompetent witnesses, because so declared by law; no other ground [of  incompetency] is assigned.
