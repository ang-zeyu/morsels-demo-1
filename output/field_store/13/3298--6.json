While he hesitated about rearing a large  family for this reason among others, the German had no such thought  of dodging the future, for he knew his children would be taken care  of.    In fact, he raised his progeny conspicuously for the State. Parental  feeling was secondary to the Kaiser's wishes. The Bucher children,  like usual German children, were in effect dedicated to the  Government, consecrated to its uses. It could come in and did come  in and take this boy or girl for that and that one for this. It had  designated Rudi for hydraulic engineering and indicated his  university course to that end. Ernst was selected for philosophy.  The parents were not only willing but proud of this. It was not for  them to resent such outside interference because of any personal  likes of their own.    Gard wrote Rebner:    \"In America, the child's future is somewhat a matter of buffeting  back and forth aimlessly between teacher and parent. The latter is  disposed to shirk the responsibility by leaning on the shoulders of  the instructor who is inclined to keep shifting the burden back to  the home. As a result, while the German youngster is early being  adapted to a particular future course for which Nature has given him  an aptitude, his American competitor is often left to drift through  the years without definite ambition, or at least with only a belated  or partly drilled preparation therefor.\"    In Germany, Kirtley observed, the Government stood as the real  father. The actual father was its representative. The mother played  a subsidiary role. All was the father idea. The Germans call it  Fatherland, not Motherland, as the English affectionately term their  own country.    This interposition of the State in the Teuton family weakens the  links of personal tenderness. The State rather than Love rules the  home. Hence resulted the unfeelingness that Kirtley observed in the  life about him in Loschwitz--the roughness so little tempered with  affection, but, instead, frankly interpreted and exhibited as the  true bearing of the dominant male's masculine nobility.    Quite normally, then, came about the extensive amount of open and  violent quarreling which Gard noticed in the households. In Villa  Elsa the Herr quarreled with the Frau, each quarreled with the  children, they quarreled with Tekla, and she took it out on the  dogs. It was not disputing among self-respecting equals, but  ill-humored domineering over those who were confessedly underneath.          CHAPTER XIII    DOWN WITH AMERICA!      The German text books that came in Gard's way proved the national  craze for what was Deutsch, _echt Deutsch_, to the exclusion of what  was not. It was almost a ferocity of inbreeding instruction. It  created the _furor Teutonicus_. The Hohenzollerns used education as  a prod to madden the Germans. It kept stirred up, with increasing  exaggeration and rage, the racial rabidness on the subject of other  nations.    Kirtley still did not believe that this reached to America and  Americans, for which topics, as already indicated, the Buchers had  shown small curiosity in their intercourse with him, seldom  mentioning the names. But his eyes were abruptly opened wide with  astonishment and concealed indignation one evening at dinner.    It was a habit for the family, when nothing was pressing, to remain  at table discussing this and that, nearly always providing the theme  was German. He encouraged this because he could learn from the  well-stocked information which the members possessed about Germany  and the Germans, and for the further reason of conversational  opportunities.    It may be best to try to reproduce the scene in outline as it  occurred. The talk had fallen upon governments, nations, peoples--a  general field of inquiry for which Kirtley had had some predilection  at college. The vast superiority of the German Government had been  again, as often before, so emphasized in Villa Elsa that he felt now  that he ought to raise a question. Should this overweening  assumption always pass unnoticed, unqualified?    It was partly because the foreigner avoided disputing with the  Germans, who made discussion unpleasant by their acrid, dictatorial  manners and drowning diapasons, that their arrogance had so rapidly  grown out of bounds. They do not recognize courtesies in debate, fly  off the handle, burst in with interruptions on the half-finished  statements and sentences of others.    Besides, Kirtley had not yet fully learned that they have not the  same understanding of things, not the same definitions for the same  words. For instance, the Buchers insisted that the Germans had the  most freedom of any nation. But their freedom meant something like  the liberty allowed in a prison yard. Free press? Yes, it was to be  found in Deutschland in its highest state, since it was always  authoritative. And there authority meant liberty of opinion. Again,  thought was the most free and liberal there, because, as it seemed,  the German was free to think just as the Kaiser thought. Equity?  Equity was only what the Teutons wanted, and therefore of the most  desirable type. And so on.    Such differences were usually antipodal--diametrically opposed. The  reason, Gard worked out, was that in America and other democratic  lands the significance of such words sprang from the common people  upward. In Germany such interpretations proceeded essentially from  the reigning family downward. Discussions under such circumstances,  instead of leading toward mutual understanding, breed acrimony.  There is little room for shadings, amicable approachments, progress  in the direction of reciprocal enlightenment.    It was a nest of blustering, pugnacious hornets which Kirtley poked  up on the evening in question, by asking:    \"How do you prove that the German Government is the best?\"    The Herr, taking his knife from his mouth--the Teuton eats  conspicuously with his knife--suddenly showed that he had evidently,  in the presence of his American guest, long held himself in on this  subject with ill-feelings that clamored to be let loose.    \"Prove it? Prove it?\" he hoarsely exclaimed. \"It needs no proof.  Everybody knows it. Could we have the greatest people without the  best Government? Could we have the best education without the best  Government? Why does everybody come to Germany to study? Why did  _you_ come? It's because these things are true. Did you ever hear of  young Germans going elsewhere to universities? They do not need to.  We have the best.\"    The family were up in arms. Their Government had been questioned.  Each member, with the exception of Fraeulein, who was \"at class,\" was  bursting to talk about America. It had no army. Therefore it  amounted to little. It had no higher education worthy of the name.  It had only one institution that could claim to be called a  university. It had no aristocracy. It was a country of low, lawless  classes. These and similar sentences flew back at Kirtley, whose  face reddened. The mask was being at last hurled off. What  self-control, indeed, had the family before maintained, when they  were so armed with displeasure concerning the United States! He  would not have credited it. It was at least illuminating, if  blinding. For what could be the excuse, provocation? Nothing that he  had ever heard of. The two peoples had been so separate and  distinct. The words of Anderson rushed into his mind. \"The Germans  can hate people they've never known, never seen. They hate on  principle and without principle.\"    Knives and forks figured in the air, beer mugs were grabbed and  banged down, napkins took refuge under the table as if in fright,  to be indiscriminately dirtied under foot. The gulped down food,  meeting the oncoming throaty expressions of irritability, created  much alimentary confusion. Gard almost trembled. Here he had been  for weeks dwelling in a friendly society, in an intimate  relationship, without any realization of what ugly thoughts were  secretly leveled at him in the form of a political unit. As an  individual, he had been most welcome. As a citizen of the United  States he was despised. The Herr vociferated:    \"What is your country, tell me, what is your country? It is _nichts,  nichts_. It is not a country. It is a ragout, a potpourri, a mess.  We do not recognize such a country. It has no beginnings, no  tradition, no unity of blood, no ideals----\" He choked and the Frau  flared forth while attempting to crack a nut between her teeth.    \"The American people are the off-scourings of Europe. They were  criminals, atheists, diseased people, failures, who were sent away  from Europe. So they go and try to found a new race, a new nation.  They try, but they fail of course....\"    When his mother got out of breath, little Ernst began with a milder,  more judicial air, though he seemed partly to have memorized  official declarations.    \"Don't you think, Herr Kirtley, it stands to reason that our  reigning family, which is admitted to be honest and has practiced  ruling for centuries, knows better how to govern a race than the  always new and untried persons who keep taking the reins of  government in a democracy? The Americans can never tell far ahead  who is to rule. There are changes all the time. How can the citizen  prepare confidently for the future? How can he plan long ahead as we  do? I have always read that this is the reason things are so steady  and stable in Germany and so uncertain and wabbling in America. This  uncertainty hanging over a republic unsettles its population. You  have panics, lynchings, graft. We are free of such scourges. Our  Government is always the same unit and to be relied on. If new  policies are begun, it is there to carry them through to their  logical end, even if it takes a generation or longer. You have  always new statesmen with new ideas.

Thus ever more and more shallow became  that blood, until it cooked only the feet: and here was our  passage of the foss.    [1] In 1271, Prince Henry, son of Richard of Cornwall, was  stabbed during the mass, in a church at Viterbo, by Guy of  Montfort, to avenge the death of his father, Simon, Earl of  Leicester, in 1261. The heart of the young Prince was placed in a  golden cup, as Villani (vii. 39) reports, on a column, at the  head of a bridge in London.      \"Even as on this side, thou seest that the boiling stream ever  diminishes,\" said the Centaur, \"I would have thee believe that on  this other its bed sinks more and more, until it comes round  again where it behoves that tyranny should groan. The divine  justice here pierces that Attila who was a scourge on earth, and  Pyrrhus and Sextus; and forever milks the tears that with the  boiling it unlocks from Rinier of Corneto, and from Rinier Pazzo,  who upon the highways made such warfare.\"    Then he turned back and repassed the ford.        CANTO XIII. Second round of the Seventh Circle: of those who have  done violence to themselves and to their goods.--The Wood of  Self-murderers.--The Harpies.--Pier delle Vigne.--Lano of Siena  and others.    Nessus had not yet reached the yonder bank when we set forward  through a wood which was marked by no path. Not green leaves but  of a dusky color, not smooth boughs but knotty and gnarled, not  fruits were there but thorns with poison. Those savage beasts  that hold in hate the tilled places between Cecina and Corneto  have no thickets so rough or so dense.    Here the foul Harpies make their nests, who chased the Trojans  from the Strophades with dismal announcement of future calamity.  They have broad wings, and human necks and faces, feet with  claws, and a great feathered belly. They make lament upon the  strange trees.    And the good Master, \"Before thou enter farther know that thou  art in the second round,\" he began to say to me, \"and wilt be,  till thou shalt come unto the horrible sand. Therefore look well  around, and so thou shalt see things that would take credence  from my speech.\"[1]    [1] Things which if told would seem incredible.      I heard wailings uttered on every side, and I saw no one who  might make them, wherefore, I, all bewildered, stopped. I believe  that he believed that I believed that all these voices issued  amid those stumps from people who because of us had hidden  themselves.    Therefore said the Master, \"If thou break off a twig from one of  these plants, the thoughts thou hast will all be cut short.\" Then  I stretched my hand a little forward and plucked a branchlet from  a great thorn-bush, and its trunk cried out, \"Why dost thou rend  me?\" When it had become dark with blood it began again to cry,  \"Why dost thou tear me? hast thou not any spirit of pity? Men we  were, and now we are become stocks; truly thy hand ought to be  more pitiful had we been the souls of serpents.\"    As from a green log that is burning at one of its ends, and from  the other drips, and hisses with the air that is escaping, so  from that broken splinter came out words and blood together;  whereon I let the tip fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.    \"If he had been able to believe before,\" replied my Sage, \"O  wounded soul, what he has seen only in my verse,[1] he would not  upon thee have stretched his hand. But the incredible thing made  me prompt him to an act which grieves my very self. But tell him  who thou wast, so that, by way of some amends, he may refresh thy  fame in the world above, whereto it is allowed him to return.\"    [1] In the story of Polydorus, in the third book of the Aeneid.      And the trunk, \"So with sweet speech dost thou allure me, that I  cannot be silent, and may it not displease you, that I am enticed  to speak a little. I am he who held both the keys of the heart of  Frederick, and who turned them, locking and unlocking so softly,  that from his confidence I kept almost every one.[1] Fidelity so  great I bore to the glorious office, that I lost slumber and  strength thereby. The harlot,[2] that never from the abode of  Caear turned her strumpet eyes,--the common death and vice of  courts,--inflamed all minds against me, and they, inflamed, did  so inflame Augustus that my glad honors turned to dismal sorrows.  My mind, in scornful temper thinking to escape scorn by death,  made me unjust toward my just self. By the strange roots of this  tree I swear to you, that I never broke faith unto my lord who  was so worthy of honor. And if one of you returneth to the world,  let him comfort my memory that yet lies prostrate from the blow  that envy gave it.\"    [1] The spirit who speaks is Pier delle Vigne, the Chancellor of  Frederick II.; of low birth, he rose to the first place in the  state; he was one of the earliest writers of Italian verse. Dante  has placed his master as well as him in Hell. See Canto X.    [3] Envie ys lavendere of the court alway;    For she ne parteth neither nyght ne day    Out of the house of Cesar, thus saith Daunte.       Legende of Goode Women, 358.60.      A while he paused, and then, \"Since he is silent,\" said the Poet  to me, \"lose not the hour, but speak and ask of him, if more  pleaseth thee.\" Whereon I to him, \"Do thou ask him further of  what thou thinkest may satisfy me, for I cannot, such pity fills  my heart.\"    Therefore he began again, \"So may this man do for thee freely  what thy speech prays, spirit incarcerate, still be pleased to  tell us how the soul is bound within these knots, and tell us, if  thou canst, if any from such limbs is ever loosed.\"    Then the trunk puffed strongly, and soon that wind was changed  into this voice: \"Briefly shall ye be answered. When the  ferocious soul departeth from the body wherefrom itself hath torn  itself, Minos sends it to the seventh gulf. It falls into the  wood, and no part is chosen for it, but where fortune flings it,  there it takes root like a grain of spelt; it springs up in a  shoot and to a wild plant. The Harpies, feeding then upon its  leaves, give pain, and to the pain a window.[1] Like the rest  we shall go for our spoils,[2] but not, forsooth, that any one  may revest himself with them, for it is not just to have that of  which one deprives himself. Hither shall we drag them, and  through the melancholy wood shall our bodies be suspended, each  on the thorn-tree of his molested shade.\"    [1] The tearing of the leaves gives an outlet to the woe.    [2] Our bodies, at the Last Judgment.      We were still attentive to the trunk, believing that it might  wish to say more to us, when we were surprised by an uproar, as  one who perceives the wild boar and the chase coming toward his  stand and hears the Feasts and the branches crashing. And behold  two on the left hand, naked and scratched, flying so violently  that they broke all the limbs of the wood. The one in front was  shouting, \"Now, help, help, Death!\" and the other, who seemed to  himself too slow, \"Lano, thy legs were not so nimble at the  jousts of the Toppo:\"[1] and when perhaps his breath was  failing, of himself and of a bush he made a group. Behind them  the wood was full of black bitches, ravenous and running like  greyhounds that have been unleashed. On him that had squatted  they set their teeth and tore him to pieces, bit by bit, then  carried off his woeful limbs.    [1] Lano was slain in flight at the defeat of the Sienese by the  Aretines, near the Pieve del Toppo, in 1280. He and Jacomo were  notorious prodigals.      My Guide then took me by the hand, and led me to the bush, which  was weeping through its bleeding breaks in vain. \"O Jacomo of  Sant' Andrea,\" it was saying, \"what hath it vantaged thee to make  of me a screen? What blame have I for thy wicked life?\" When the  Master had stopped beside it, he said, \"Who wast thou, who  through so many wounds blowest forth with blood thy woeful  speech?\" And he to us, \"O souls who art arrived to see the  shameful ravage that hath thus disjoined my leaves from me,  collect them at the foot of the wretched bush. I was of the city  which for the Baptist changed her first patron;[1] wherefore will  he always make her sorrowful with his art. And were it not that  at the passage of the Arno some semblance of him yet remains,  those citizens who afterwards rebuilt it upon the ashes that were  left by Attila[2] would have labored in vain. I made a gibbet for  myself of my own dwelling.\"    [1] The first patron of florence was Mars; a fragment of a statue  of whom stood till 1333 on the Ponte Vecchio.    [2] It was not Attila, but Totila, who in 542 besieged Florence,  and, according to false popular tradition, burned it. The names  and personages were frequently confounded in the Dark Ages.        CANTO XIV. Third round of the Seventh Circle of those who have  done violence to God.--The Burning Sand.--Capaneus.--Figure of  the Old Man in Crete.--The Rivers of Hell.    Because the charity of my native place constrained me, I gathered  up the scattered leaves and gave them back to him who was already  hoarse.    Then we came to the confine, where the second round is divided  from the third, and where is seen a horrible mode of justice.    To make clearly manifest the new things, I say that we had  reached a plain which from its bed removeth every plant. The  woeful wood is a garland round about it, even as the dismal foss  to that. Here, on the very edge, we stayed our steps. The floor  was a dry and dense sand, not made in other fashion than that  which of old was trodden by the feet of Cato.    O vengeance of God, how much thou oughtest to be feared by every  one who readeth that which was manifest unto mine eyes!    Of naked souls I saw many flocks, that were all weeping very"]]]
