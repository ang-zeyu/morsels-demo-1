[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/209"],[0,"The Turn of the Screw (#11)"],[1,"now--of the  prodigious private commentary, all under still more private correction,  with which, in these days, I overscored their full hours. They had shown  me from the first a facility for everything, a general faculty which,  taking a fresh start, achieved remarkable flights. They got their little  tasks as if they loved them, and indulged, from the mere exuberance of  the gift, in the most unimposed little miracles of memory. They not  only popped out at me as tigers and as Romans, but as Shakespeareans,  astronomers, and navigators. This was so singularly the case that it had  presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at the present day,  I am at a loss for a different explanation: I allude to my unnatural  composure on the subject of another school for Miles. What I remember  is that I was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that  contentment must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking  show of cleverness. He was too clever for a bad governess, for a  parson's daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if not the brightest  thread in the pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the impression I  might have got, if I had dared to work it out, that he was under some  influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremendous  incitement.    If it was easy to reflect, however, that such a boy could postpone  school, it was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been  \"kicked out\" by a schoolmaster was a mystification without end. Let me  add that in their company now--and I was careful almost never to be out  of it--I could follow no scent very far. We lived in a cloud of music  and love and success and private theatricals. The musical sense in each  of the children was of the quickest, but the elder in especial had a  marvelous knack of catching and repeating. The schoolroom piano  broke into all gruesome fancies; and when that failed there were  confabulations in corners, with a sequel of one of them going out in  the highest spirits in order to \"come in\" as something new. I had had  brothers myself, and it was no revelation to me that little girls could  be slavish idolaters of little boys. What surpassed everything was that  there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior age,  sex, and intelligence so fine a consideration. They were extraordinarily  at one, and to say that they never either quarreled or complained is  to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of sweetness.  Sometimes, indeed, when I dropped into coarseness, I perhaps came across  traces of little understandings between them by which one of them should  keep me occupied while the other slipped away. There is a naive side,  I suppose, in all diplomacy; but if my pupils practiced upon me, it was  surely with the minimum of grossness. It was all in the other quarter  that, after a lull, the grossness broke out.    I find that I really hang back; but I must take my plunge. In going on  with the record of what was hideous at Bly, I not only challenge the  most liberal faith--for which I little care; but--and this is another  matter--I renew what I myself suffered, I again push my way through it  to the end. There came suddenly an hour after which, as I look back, the  affair seems to me to have been all pure suffering; but I have at least  reached the heart of it, and the straightest road out is doubtless to  advance. One evening--with nothing to lead up or to prepare it--I felt  the cold touch of the impression that had breathed on me the night of  my arrival and which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned, I should  probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been  less agitated. I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a couple of  candles. There was a roomful of old books at Bly--last-century fiction,  some of it, which, to the extent of a distinctly deprecated renown,  but never to so much as that of a stray specimen, had reached the  sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of my youth. I  remember that the book I had in my hand was Fielding's Amelia; also that  I was wholly awake. I recall further both a general conviction that it  was horribly late and a particular objection to looking at my watch. I  figure, finally, that the white curtain draping, in the fashion of those  days, the head of Flora's little bed, shrouded, as I had assured myself  long before, the perfection of childish rest. I recollect in short that,  though I was deeply interested in my author, I found myself, at the turn  of a page and with his spell all scattered, looking straight up from  him and hard at the door of my room. There was a moment during which  I listened, reminded of the faint sense I had had, the first night, of  there being something undefinably astir in the house, and noted the soft  breath of the open casement just move the half-drawn blind. Then, with  all the marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had  there been anyone to admire it, I laid down my book, rose to my feet,  and, taking a candle, went straight out of the room and, from the  passage, on which my light made little impression, noiselessly closed  and locked the door.    I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went  straight along the lobby, holding my candle high, till I came within  sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the  staircase. At this point I precipitately found myself aware of three  things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had flashes of  succession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and I perceived,  by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of earliest morning  rendered it unnecessary. Without it, the next instant, I saw that there  was someone on the stair. I speak of sequences, but I required no lapse  of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter with Quint. The  apparition had reached the landing halfway up and was therefore on the  spot nearest the window, where at sight of me, it stopped short and  fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower and from the garden.  He knew me as well as I knew him; and so, in the cold, faint twilight,  with a glimmer in the high glass and another on the polish of the  oak stair below, we faced each other in our common intensity. He was  absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable, dangerous presence.  But that was not the wonder of wonders; I reserve this distinction for  quite another circumstance: the circumstance that dread had unmistakably  quitted me and that there was nothing in me there that didn't meet and  measure him.    I had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment, but I had,  thank God, no terror. And he knew I had not--I found myself at the end  of an instant magnificently aware of this. I felt, in a fierce rigor of  confidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease--for  the time, at least--to have him to reckon with; and during the minute,  accordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview:  hideous just because it WAS human, as human as to have met alone, in  the small hours, in a sleeping house, some enemy, some adventurer,  some criminal. It was the dead silence of our long gaze at such close  quarters that gave the whole horror, huge as it was, its only note of  the unnatural. If I had met a murderer in such a place and at such an  hour, we still at least would have spoken. Something would have passed,  in life, between us; if nothing had passed, one of us would have moved.  The moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to  make me doubt if even _I_ were in life. I can't express what followed it  save by saying that the silence itself--which was indeed in a manner  an attestation of my strength--became the element into which I saw the  figure disappear; in which I definitely saw it turn as I might have  seen the low wretch to which it had once belonged turn on receipt of an  order, and pass, with my eyes on the villainous back that no hunch could  have more disfigured, straight down the staircase and into the darkness  in which the next bend was lost.          X      I remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect presently  of understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone: then I  returned to my room. The foremost thing I saw there by the light of the  candle I had left burning was that Flora's little bed was empty; and on  this I caught my breath with all the terror that, five minutes before,  I had been able to resist. I dashed at the place in which I had left her  lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were  disarranged) the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled forward;  then my step, to my unutterable relief, produced an answering sound: I  perceived an agitation of the window blind, and the child, ducking down,  emerged rosily from the other side of it. She stood there in so much of  her candor and so little of her nightgown, with her pink bare feet and  the golden glow of her curls. She looked intensely grave, and I had  never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the thrill  of which had just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness that  she addressed me with a reproach. \"You naughty: where HAVE you  been?\"--instead of challenging her own irregularity I found myself  arraigned and explaining. She herself explained, for that matter, with  the loveliest, eagerest simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay  there, that I was out of the room, and had jumped up to see what had  become of me. I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back  into my chair--feeling then, and then only, a little faint; and she had  pattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee, given herself  to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful little  face that was still flushed with sleep.

JAMES GIVENS                                     _Justice of the Peace._[46]         This indenture made and entered into this 14th day August, A.D.       1860 between A. J. Houstis as county Judge of Humboldt County for       and in behalf of a certain Indian boy called and known by the       name of \"Smoky\" of the first part and Austin Wiley, of the said       county of the second part. That Whereas the said Austin Wiley had       in his possession and under his control a certain Indian boy       named \"Smoky\" And whereas the said Austin Wiley avers that he       with the assistance of James Frint obtained said Indian of their       parents in Mattole valley of this county, by and with their       consent. And whereas the said Austin Wiley does now apply to me       as County Judge to bond and apprentice the said boy \"Smoky\" to       him according to law to learn the art of household duties about       his premises and in this respect to hold the relation of an       apprentice until he shall arrive at the lawful majority, the age       of twenty-five years, or for the term of seventeen years next       following this indenture, the boy being now considered eight       years of age. And whereas it appears to me that the second party       in this agreement has obtained this boy in a lawful manner       without fraud or oppression and that the boy \"Smoky\" therefore       comes justly under the first provision of the law providing for       apprenticeship approved April, 8th A.D. 1860.         Now therefore I, A. J. Houstis, County Judge Aforesaid, in       consideration of the premises and acting for and on behalf of the       said Indian boy \"Smoky\" do by these presents bind and apprentice       as above stated the said boy \"Smoky\" to Austin Wiley for and       during the term of seventeen years next following this indenture       entitling him according to law to have the care custody, control       and earnings of said boy during said period and all other       advantages and responsibilities growing out of this indenture and       apprenticeship, that the law contemplates. And the said Austin       Wiley, the second part in his agreement doth hereby agree,       obligate and bind himself that he will truly and faithfully       discharge all obligations on his part growing out of this       indenture according to law. That he will suitably clothe and       provide the necessaries of life for the said boy during his term       of indenture. That he will in all respects treat him in a human       manner. That he will not take him out of this state nor transfer       him to any party not known in this agreement without the consent       of legal authorities endorsed thereon and that in all respects       she will carry out every provision of law that contemplates the       safety, protection and well being of said boy.         In witness whereof the parties of this indenture hereunto set       their hand and seal this date first above written.
