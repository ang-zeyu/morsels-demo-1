There are direct relationships, such as we have been speaking of, which  are essential to the every-day working of the process, and others which  are indirect, though none the less important for they must have  exercised an influence throughout the ages. These latter are furnished  by the physical--the inorganic world, by climate, by the supply of the  particular kind of breeding stations, by the scarcity or abundance of  the necessary food and by the relative position of the food supply to  the places suitable for breeding. Why does the Reed-Bunting cling so  tenaciously to an acre or more of marshy ground, while the Guillemot  rests content with a few square feet on a particular ledge of rock? The  answer is the same in both cases--to facilitate reproduction. But why  should a small bird require so many square yards, whilst a very much  larger one is satisfied with so small an area? The explanation must be  sought in the conditions of existence. The Reed-Bunting has no  difficulty in finding a position suitable for the construction of its  nest; there are acres of waste land and reedy swamps capable of  supplying food for large numbers of individuals, and the necessary  situations for countless nests. But its young, like those of many  another species, are born in a very helpless state. For all practical  purposes they are without covering of any description and consequently  require protection from the elements, warmth from the body of the  brooding bird, and repeated supplies of nourishment. A threefold burden  is thus imposed upon the parents: they must find food for themselves,  they must afford protection to the young by brooding, and they must  supply them with the necessary food at regular intervals. And their  ability to do all this that is demanded of them will be severely taxed  by the brooding which must perforce curtail the time available for the  collection of food.    Let us then suppose that the Reed-Buntings inhabiting a certain piece of  marsh are divided into two classes, those which are pugnacious and  intolerant of the approach of strangers, and those which welcome their  presence. The nests of the former will be built in isolation, those of  the latter in close proximity. In due course eggs will be laid and  incubation performed, and thus far all alike will probably be  successful. Here, however, a critical point is reached. If the young are  to be freed from the risk of exposure, the parents must find the  necessary supply of food rapidly. But manifestly all will not be in a  like satisfactory position to accomplish this, for whereas the isolated  pairs will have free access to all the food in the immediate vicinity of  the nest, those which have built in proximity to one another, meeting  competition in every direction, will be compelled to roam farther  afield and waste much valuable time by doing so; and under conditions  which can well be imagined, even this slight loss of time will be  sufficient to impede the growth of the delicate offspring, or to lead  perhaps to still greater disaster. If any one doubts this, let him first  examine one of the fragile offspring; let him then study the conditions  under which it is reared, observing the proportion of time it passes in  sleep and the anxiety of the parent bird to brood; and finally let him  picture to himself its plight in a wet season if, in order to collect  the necessary food, the parents were obliged to absent themselves for  periods of long duration.    Now take the case of the Guillemot. Its young at birth are by no means  helpless in the sense that the young Reed-Bunting is, and food is  readily procured. But breeding stations are scarce, for although there  are many miles of cliff-bound coast, yet not every type of rock  formation produces the fissures and ledges upon which the bird rests.  Hence vast stretches of coast-line remain uninhabited, and the birds are  forced to concentrate at certain points, where year after year they  assemble in countless numbers from distant parts of the ocean. If, then,  different individuals were to jostle one another from adjoining  positions, and each one were to attempt to occupy a ledge in solitary  State, not only would the successful ones gain no advantage from the  additional space over which they exercised dominion, but inasmuch as  many members that were fitted to breed would be precluded from doing  so, the status of the species as a whole would be seriously affected.  The amount of space occupied by each individual is therefore a matter of  urgent importance. A few square feet of rock sufficient for the  immediate purpose of incubation is all that can be allowed if the  species is to maintain its position in the struggle for existence.    Our difficulty in estimating the importance of the various factors that  make for success or failure arises from our inability to see more than a  small part of the scene as it slowly unfolds itself. The peculiar  circumstances under which these cliff-breeding forms dwell does,  however, enable us to picture, on the one hand, the precarious situation  of an individual that was incapable of winning or holding a position at  the accustomed breeding station, and, on the other, the plight of the  species as a whole if each one exercised authority over too large an  area. With the majority of species it is difficult to do this. So many  square miles of suitable breeding ground are inhabited by so few  Reed-Buntings that, even supposing certain members were to establish an  ascendency over too wide an area, it would be impossible to discover by  actual observation whether the race as a whole were being adversely  affected. Competition doubtless varies at different periods and in  different districts according to the numerical standing of the species  in a given locality and according to the numerical standing of others  that require similar conditions of existence; at times it may even be  absent, just as at any moment it may become acute. These examples show  how profoundly the evolution of the breeding territory may have been  influenced by relationships in the inorganic world, and they give some  idea of the intricate nature of the problem with which we have to deal.    I mentioned that the first visible manifestation of the revival of the  sexual instinct was to be found in the movements undertaken by the males  at the commencement of the breeding season. Such movements are  characterised by a definiteness of purpose, whether they involve a  protracted journey of some hundreds of miles or merely embrace a parish  or so in extent, and that purpose is the acquirement of a territory  suitable for rearing offspring. They are thus directly related to the  territory, and the question arises as to whether their origin may not be  traced to such relatedness. So long as we fix our attention solely upon  the magnitude of the distance traversed the suggestion may seem a  fanciful one. Nevertheless, if the battles between males of the same  species _are_ directly related to the occupation of a position suitable  for breeding purposes, if those which occur between males of closely  related forms _can_ be traced to a similar source, if the females take  their share in the defence of the ground that is occupied, if, in short,  the competition is as severe as I believe it to be, and is wholly  responsible for the strife which is prevalent at the commencement of the  breeding season--then such competition must have introduced profound  modifications in the distribution of species; it must have even  influenced the question of the survival of certain forms and the  elimination of others; and since the powers of locomotion of a bird are  so highly developed it must have led to an extension of breeding range,  limited only by unfavourable conditions of existence.          CHAPTER II    THE DISPOSITION TO SECURE A TERRITORY      Those who have studied bird life throughout the year are aware that the  distribution of individuals changes with the changing seasons. During  autumn and winter, food is not so plentiful and can only be found in  certain places, and so, partly by force of circumstances and partly on  account of the gregarious instinct which then comes into functional  activity, different individuals are drawn together and form flocks of  greater or less dimensions, which come and go according to the  prevailing climatic conditions. But with the advent of spring a change  comes over the scene: flocks disperse, family parties break up, summer  migrants begin to arrive, and the hedgerows and plantations are suddenly  quickened into life. The silence of the winter is broken by an outburst  of song from the throats of many different species, and individuals  appear in their old haunts and vie with one another in advertising their  presence by the aid of whatever vocal powers they happen to possess--the  Woodpecker utters its monotonous call from the accustomed oak; the  Missel-Thrush, perched upon the topmost branches of the elm,  persistently repeats its few wild notes; and the Swallow returns to the  barn.    All of this we observe each season, and our thoughts probably travel to  the delicate piece of architecture in the undergrowth, or to the hole  excavated with such skill in the tree trunk; to the beautifully shaped  eggs; to the parent birds carrying out their work with devoted zeal--in  fact, to the whole series of events which complete the sexual life of  the individual; and the attachment of a particular bird to a particular  spot is readily accounted for in terms of one or other of the emotions  which centre round the human home.    But if this behaviour is to be understood aright; if, that is to say,  the exact position it occupies in the drama of bird life is to be  properly determined, and its biological significance estimated at its  true value, it is above all things necessary to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31993"],[0,"'Round the yule-log: Christmas in Norway (#4)"],[1,"condition. The bay mare stretched out her old smart legs, and we  arrived at length in sight of the dear old house. Thor jumped off the  sledge to undo the gate, and as we merrily drove up to the door we were  met by the boisterous welcome of old Rover, who, in his frantic joy at  hearing my voice, almost broke his chains in trying to rush at me.
