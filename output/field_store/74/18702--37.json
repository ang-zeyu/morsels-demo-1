Fauvel, \"sleeps in the outer room on a  sofa-bedstead, which he unfolds at night, and folds up in the morning.\"    \"Is he here now?\" inquired the commissary.    \"Yes, monsieur,\" answered the banker.    He opened the door and called:    \"Anselme!\"    This boy was the favorite servant of M. Fauvel, and had lived with him  for ten years. He knew that he would not be suspected; but the idea of  being connected in any way with a robbery is terrible, and he entered  the room trembling like a leaf.    \"Did you sleep in the next room last night?\" asked the commissary.    \"Yes, monsieur, as usual.\"    \"At what hour did you go to bed?\"    \"About half-past ten; I had spent the evening at a cafe near by, with  monsieur's valet.\"    \"Did you hear no noise during the night?\"    \"Not a sound; and still I sleep so lightly, that, if monsieur comes down  to the cash-room when I am asleep, I am instantly awakened by the sound  of his footsteps.\"    \"Monsieur Fauvel often comes to the cash-room at night, does he?\"    \"No, monsieur; very seldom.\"    \"Did he come last night?\"    \"No, monsieur, I am very certain he did not; for I was kept awake nearly  all night by the strong coffee I had drunk with the valet.\"    \"That will do; you can retire,\" said the commissary.    When Anselme had left the room, Fanferlot resumed his search. He opened  the door of the private staircase.    \"Where do these stairs lead to?\" he asked.    \"To my private office,\" replied M. Fauvel.    \"Is not that the room whither I was conducted when I first came?\"  inquired the commissary.    \"The same.\"    \"I would like to see it,\" said Fanferlot, \"and examine the entrances to  it.\"    \"Nothing is more easy,\" said M. Fauvel, eagerly; \"follow me, gentlemen,  and you come too, Prosper.\"    M. Fauvel's private office consisted of two rooms; the waiting-room,  sumptuously furnished and beautifully decorated, and the study where he  transacted business. The furniture in this room was composed of a large  office-desk, several leather-covered chairs, and, on either side of the  fireplace, a secretary and a book-shelf.    These two rooms had only three doors; one opened on the private  stairway, another into the banker's bedroom, and the third into the main  vestibule. It was through this last door that the banker's clients and  visitors were admitted.    M. Fanferlot examined the study at a glance. He seemed puzzled, like  a man who had flattered himself with the hope of discovering some  indication, and had found nothing.    \"Let us see the adjoining room,\" he said.    He passed into the waiting-room, followed by the banker and the  commissary of police.    Prosper remained alone in the study.    Despite the disordered state of his mind, he could not but perceive that  his situation was momentarily becoming more serious.    He had demanded and accepted the contest with his chief; the struggle  had commenced; and now it no longer depended upon his own will to arrest  the consequences of his action.    They were about to engage in a bitter conflict, utilizing all weapons,  until one of the two should succumb, the loss of honor being the cost of  defeat.    In the eyes of justice, who would be the innocent man?    Alas! the unfortunate cashier saw only too clearly that the chances  were terribly unequal, and was overwhelmed with the sense of his own  inferiority.    Never had he thought that his chief would carry out his threats; for,  in a contest of this nature, M. Fauvel would have as much to risk as his  cashier, and more to lose.    He was sitting near the fireplace, absorbed in the most gloomy  forebodings, when the banker's chamber-door suddenly opened, and a  beautiful girl appeared on the threshold.    She was tall and slender; a loose morning gown, confined at the waist  by a simple black ribbon, betrayed to advantage the graceful elegance of  her figure. Her black eyes were large and soft; her complexion had  the creamy pallor of a white camellia; and her beautiful dark hair,  carelessly held together by a tortoise-shell comb, fell in a profusion  of soft curls upon her exquisite neck. She was Madeleine, M. Fauvel's  niece, of whom he had spoken not long before.    Seeing Prosper in the study, where probably she expected to find her  uncle alone, she could not refrain from an exclamation of surprise.    \"Ah!\"    Prosper started up as if he had received an electric shock. His eyes,  a moment before so dull and heavy, now sparkled with joy as if he had  caught a glimpse of a messenger of hope.    \"Madeleine,\" he gasped, \"Madeleine!\"    The young girl was blushing crimson. She seemed about to hastily  retreat, and stepped back; but, Prosper having advanced toward her, she  was overcome by a sentiment stronger than her will, and extended her  hand, which he seized and pressed with much agitation.    They stood thus face to face, but with averted looks, as if they dared  not let their eyes meet for fear of betraying their feelings; having  much to say, and not knowing how to begin, they stood silent.    Finally Madeleine murmured, in a scarcely audible voice:    \"You, Prosper--you!\"    These words broke the spell. The cashier dropped the white hand which he  held, and answered bitterly:    \"Yes, this is Prosper, the companion of your childhood, suspected,  accused of the most disgraceful theft; Prosper, whom your uncle has  just delivered up to justice, and who, before the day is over, will be  arrested, and thrown into prison.\"    Madeleine, with a terrified gesture, cried in a tone of anguish:    \"Good heavens! Prosper, what are you saying?\"    \"What, mademoiselle! do you not know what has happened? Have not your  aunt and cousins told you?\"    \"They have told me nothing. I have scarcely seen my cousins this  morning; and my aunt is so ill that I felt uneasy, and came to tell  uncle. But for Heaven's sake speak: tell me the cause of your distress.\"    Prosper hesitated. Perhaps it occurred to him to open his heart to  Madeleine, of revealing to her his most secret thoughts. A remembrance  of the past chilled his confidence. He sadly shook his head, and  replied:    \"Thanks, mademoiselle, for this proof of interest, the last, doubtless,  that I shall ever receive from you; but allow me, by being silent, to  spare you distress, and myself the mortification of blushing before  you.\"    Madeleine interrupted him imperiously:    \"I insist upon knowing.\"    \"Alas, mademoiselle!\" answered Prosper, \"you will only too soon learn my  misfortune and disgrace; then, yes, then you will applaud yourself for  what you have done.\"    She became more urgent; instead of commanding, she entreated; but  Prosper was inflexible.    \"Your uncle is in the adjoining room, mademoiselle, with the commissary  of police and a detective. They will soon return. I entreat you to  retire that they may not find you here.\"    As he spoke he gently pushed her through the door, and closed it upon  her.    It was time, for the next moment the commissary and Monsieur Fauvel  entered. They had visited the main entrance and waiting-room, and had  heard nothing of what had passed in the study.    But Fanferlot had heard for them.    This excellent bloodhound had not lost sight of the cashier. He said to  himself, \"Now that my young gentleman believes himself to be alone,  his face will betray him. I shall detect a smile or a wink that will  enlighten me.\"    Leaving M. Fauvel and the commissary to pursue their investigations, he  posted himself to watch. He saw the door open, and Madeleine appear upon  the threshold; he lost not a single word or gesture of the rapid scene  which had passed.    It mattered little that every word of this scene was an enigma. M.  Fanferlot was skilful enough to complete the sentences he did not  understand.    As yet he only had a suspicion; but a mere suspicion is better than  nothing; it is a point to start from. So prompt was he in building a  plan upon the slightest incident that he thought he saw in the past of  these people, who were utter strangers to him, glimpses of a domestic  drama.    If the commissary of police is a sceptic, the detective has faith; he  believes in evil.    \"I understand the case now,\" said he to himself. \"This man loves the  young lady, who is really very pretty; and, as he is quite handsome,  I suppose his love is reciprocated. This love-affair vexes the banker,  who, not knowing how to get rid of the importunate lover by fair means,  has to resort to foul, and plans this imaginary robbery, which is very  ingenious.\"    Thus to M. Fanferlot's mind, the banker had simply robbed himself, and  the innocent cashier was the victim of an odious machination.    But this conviction was, at present, of little service to Prosper.    Fanferlot, the ambitious, who had determined to obtain renown in his  profession, decided to keep his conjectures to himself.    \"I will let the others go their way, and I'll go mine,\" he said.  \"When, by dint of close watching and patient investigation I shall have  collected proof sufficient to insure certain conviction, I will unmask  the scoundrel.\"    He was radiant. He had at last found the crime, so long looked for,  which would make him celebrated. Nothing was wanting, neither the odious  circumstances, nor the mystery, nor even the romantic and sentimental  element represented by Prosper and Madeleine.    Success seemed difficult, almost impossible; but Fanferlot, the  Squirrel, had great confidence in his own genius for investigation.    Meanwhile, the search"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38032"],[0,"Game Birds and Game Fishes of the Pacific Coast (#4)"],[1,"genus from the blue  quail family. In many respects it resembles the bobwhite in color,  though far more fancifully marked. It is also nearly one-half larger,  though in some parts of Arizona and in New Mexico there is a smaller  species of the same genus known as fool quail. The Mexican bird is far  from a fool, and although it roosts on the ground like the bobwhite,  it is resourceful enough to take care of itself in a country where  vermin of all kinds are very plentiful. Its range is from near the  northern boundary south through the larger portion of Mexico.    The Montezuma quail is emphatically a grass bird and inhabits the  grassy foothills and the cultivated fields, where it affords fine  sport with a dog. It is very cosmopolitan as to climate, for it is  found at altitudes of from five to six thousand feet, where  considerable snow falls, as well as in the foothills of the hot,  tropical valleys of the lowlands, and thrives equally well in all  sections. It is a bird of peculiar habits. When startled by the  approach of an enemy the bevy at once huddles together, where the  birds remain motionless until they are approached to within from one  to four feet, according to the cover they are in. If they think that  they have not been seen or that the object of their alarm is going to  pass by, there is not the slightest motion made by any one of them,  but when they decide to take wing for safety every bird in perfect  unison springs into the air to a height of about six feet and darts  rapidly away. They are quick on the wing and seem able to carry away a  good deal of shot. The flight generally is not more than one hundred  yards, and when they alight they scatter well and will then out-hide  any bird that lives. I have both ridden and walked, without a dog, for  hours through a country where they were plentiful without seeing a  bird, except where I chanced to nearly step upon them, yet with a dog  I have found on the same grounds probably an average of fifteen bevies  to the square mile. For work with a dog I prefer them to any bird I  have ever hunted. They give out a strong scent, for points on bevies  of from six to fifteen birds, made thirty to forty yards away are no  uncommon occurrence. Then when you walk in front of your dog they  never flush until you have almost stepped upon them. A scattered bevy  will lie securely hid until each individual is flushed. Unlike the  blue quail they never gather in large flocks, but always remain in  single broods until broken up in the spring for nesting purposes.    =Color=--Male--The head of these birds have a very bizarre appearance  whose strange black and white markings seem to have no more purpose or  design than the black and white chalk marks on a clown's face. The  head of the male is crested with semi-erectile feathers in the shape  of a broad hood of dark yellowish brown color, falling about half way  down the neck; groundwork of the back and of the wing and tail coverts  is a dark ocher barred with a deep rich brown; breast and flanks are  nearly black, dotted with large white spots, and from the throat to  the vent is a stripe about five-eighths of an inch wide of a dark rich  chestnut.    =Female=--The female, with the exception of the white dots on the  breast and flanks is much the color of the female bobwhite.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is like that of the quail generally, simply  a depression in the ground, carefully hidden away in some thick matted  grass or bunch of brush, and generally higher up the hill-sides than  they are found at other times. Eggs, white, and of a china appearance,  and from ten to fifteen in number.    =Measurements=--While these birds are fully one-half larger than the  blue quail, the very short tail makes their total length not over 8 to  9 inches; wing, 5 inches, and bill, 5/8.        [Illustration: BOBWHITE (Colinus virginianus)]      THE BOBWHITE    (Colinus virginianus)    I have said that the voice of the bobwhite is heard in the land. This  is true, for the clear notes of his little throat awaken the morning  echoes from eastern Oregon to the islands of Puget Sound. This great  little game bird, whose praise has been recounted in volumes of prose  and sung in the rhythmic measures of countless lines of verse, is not  a native of the coast, but he knew a good thing when he saw it. When  he was turned loose in the Pacific Northwest he cast his bright little  eyes about him and remarked to himself:        \"This looks good to me. Bobwhite, get busy at once in raising big      families and settle up your new domain.\"    And he has done it, for now the sportsmen of the Pacific Northwest  have better bobwhite shooting than is to be found in any part of the  eastern states.    The bobwhite roosts on the ground and always remains in single broods.  When startled they huddle together and flush in a bunch. They are good  hiders and lie well to the dog. They are seldom found far from water  and rarely in heavy brush. They are fond of stubble or corn fields and  the grassy nooks along the fences. Many efforts have been made to  acclimatize this species farther south in California but they have all  proved failures on account of the dryer climate and the lack of  insects during the rearing season of their young. They must have a  damp climate where the vegetation remains green, thus furnishing an  abundance of insects during the early summer on which to feed their  young. For until a bobwhite is nearly grown it lives almost entirely  upon insects.    =Color=--Male--General color of the upper parts, light buff, marked  with triangular blotches of brown; head and back of the neck, dark  chestnut; forehead, gray; light stripe from above the eye passing down  the side of the neck; throat, white or very light buff, faintly  bordered with dark brown or black; breast, light buff with the  feathers tipped with brown; flanks chestnut mixed with black and  white.    Female--Generally lighter, and without the white throat and light  breast.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nests are rude depressions on the ground beneath  a fence rail or fallen limb, or in a bunch of thick grass or brush.  The eggs number anywhere from fifteen to twenty and of a pure white  color.    =Measurements=--Total length about nine inches; wing, 4-1/2 inches;  bill, 5/8.      THE MASKED BOBWHITE    (Colinus ridgewayi)    A smaller species of the bobwhite, known as the masked bobwhite, were  reasonably plentiful along the border of southern Arizona and south  through the state of Sonora, Mexico. Like the typical bobwhite they  were strictly a field and grass bird. But through the heavy pasturing  of that section, together with a series of dry seasons denuding the  whole country of such cover as would be necessary for their protection  from hawks and vermin, they have become nearly if not quite extinct.  They differed from the eastern bobwhite in that the male had a black  throat instead of a white one and a bright cinnamon breast. The  female differed also in having a light buff throat, and generally of a  lighter color.
