The birds rebuilt their nest  three times, and finally we came to their rescue and placed a box in a  safe place under the eaves of the house, and Mr. Wren with his keen,  shrewd eyes, soon saw and appropriated it. There they stayed and raised  a pretty family of birdies; and I hope he taught them, as he did me, a  lesson in perseverance I'll never forget.\"           [Illustration: From col. F. M.

HOUSE WREN.                  Copyrighted by Nature Study Pub. Co., 1897, Chicago.]          THE RUBY-THROATED HUMMING BIRD.      DEAR YOUNG FOLKS:    I fancy you think I cannot stop long enough to tell you a story, even  about myself. It is true, I am always busy with the flowers, drinking  their honey with my long bill, as you must be busy with your books, if  you would learn what they teach. I always select for my food the  sweetest flowers that grow in the garden.    Do you think you would be vain if you had my beautiful colors to wear?  Of course, you would not, but so many of my brothers and sisters have  been destroyed to adorn the bonnets and headdresses of the thoughtless  that the children cannot be too early taught to love us too well to do  us harm. Have you ever seen a ruby? It is one of the most valued of  gems. It is the color of my throat, and from its rare and brilliant  beauty I get a part of my name. The ruby is worn by great ladies and,  with the emerald and topaz, whose bright colors I also wear, is much  esteemed as an ornament.    If you will come into the garden in the late afternoon, between six  and seven o'clock, when I am taking my supper, and when the sun is  beginning to close his great eye, you will see his rays shoot sidewise  and show all the splendor of my plumage. You will see me, too, if your  eyes are sharp enough, draw up my tiny claws, pause in front of a rose,  and remain seemingly motionless. But listen, and you will hear the  reason for my name--a tense humming sound. Some call me a Hummer indeed.    I spend only half the year in the garden, coming in May and saying  farewell in October. After my mate and I are gone you may find our nest.  But your eyes will be sharp indeed if they detect it when the leaves are  on the trees, it is so small and blends with the branches. We use  fern-wool and soft down to build it, and shingle it with lichens to  match the branch it nests upon. You should see the tiny eggs of pure  white. But we, our nest and our eggs, are so dainty and delicate that  they should never be touched. We are only to be looked at and admired.    Farewell. Look for me when you go a-Maying.                                                RUBY.          THE HOUSE WREN.        \"It was a merry time        When Jenny Wren was young,      When prettily she looked,        And sweetly, too, she sung.\"      \"In looking over an old memorandum book the other day,\" says Col. S. T.  Walker, of Florida, \"I came across the following notes concerning the  nesting of the House Wren. I was sick at the time, and watched the whole  proceeding, from the laying of the first stick to the conclusion. The  nest was placed in one of the pigeonholes of my desk, and the birds  effected an entrance to the room through sundry cracks in the log cabin.\"     Nest begun                         April 15th.   Nest completed and first egg laid  April 27th.   Last egg laid                         May 3rd.   Began sitting                         May 4th.   Hatching completed                   May 18th.   Young began to fly                   May 27th.   Young left the nest                  June 1st.   Total time occupied                   47 days.    Such is the usual time required for bringing forth a brood of this  species of Wren, which is the best known of the family. In the  Atlantic states it is more numerous than in the far west, where  wooded localities are its chosen haunts, and where it is equally at  home in the cottonwoods of the river valleys, and on the aspens just  below the timber line on lofty mountains.    Mrs. Osgood Wright says very quaintly that the House Wren is a bird  who has allowed the word _male_ to be obliterated from its _social_  constitution at least: that we always speak of Jenny Wren: always refer  to the Wren as _she_ as we do of a ship. That it is Johnny Wren who  sings and disports himself generally, but it is Jenny, who, by dint of  much scolding and fussing, keeps herself well to the front. She chooses  the building-site and settles all the little domestic details. If Johnny  does not like her choice, he may go away and stay away; she will remain  where she has taken up her abode and make a second matrimonial venture.    The House Wren's song is a merry one, sudden, abruptly ended, and  frequently repeated. It is heard from the middle of April to October,  and upon the bird's arrival it at once sets about preparing its nest, a  loose heap of sticks with a soft lining, in holes, boxes, and the like.  From six to ten tiny, cream-colored eggs are laid, so thickly spotted  with brown that the whole egg is tinged.    The House Wren is not only one of our most interesting and familiar  neighbors, but it is useful as an exterminator of insects, upon which it  feeds. Frequently it seizes small butterflies when on the wing. We have  in mind a sick child whose convalescence was hastened and cheered by the  near-by presence of the merry House Wren, which sings its sweet little  trilling song, hour after hour, hardly stopping long enough to find food  for its meals.           [Illustration: From col. J. G. Parker. Jr.                  PHOEBE.                  Copyrighted by Nature Study Pub. Co., 1897, Chicago.]    THE PHOEBE.        Oft the Phoebe's cheery notes      Wake the laboring swain;      \"Come, come!\" say the merry throats,      \"Morn is here again.\"      Phoebe, Phoebe! let them sing for aye,      Calling him to labor at the break of day.                                        --C. C. M.      Nearly everywhere in the United States we find this cheerful bird, known  as Pewee, Barn Pewee, Bridge Pewee, or Phoebe, or Pewit Flycatcher. \"It  is one of that charming coterie of the feathered tribe who cheer the  abode of man with their presence.\" There are few farmyards without a  pair of Pewees, who do the farmer much service by lessening the number  of flies about the barn, and by calling him to his work in the morning  by their cheery notes.    Dr. Brewer says that this species is attracted both to the vicinity of  water and to the neighborhood of dwellings, probably for the same  reason--the abundance of insects in either situation. They are a  familiar, confiding, and gentle bird, attached to localities, and  returning to them year after year. Their nests are found in sheltered  situations, as under a bridge, a projecting rock, in the porches of  houses, etc. They have been known to build on a small shelf in the porch  of a dwelling, against the wall of a railroad station, within reach of  the passengers, and under a projecting window-sill, in full view of the  family, entirely unmoved by the presence of the latter at meal time.    Like all the flycatcher family the Phoebe takes its food mostly flying.  Mrs. Wright says that the Pewee in his primitive state haunts dim woods  and running water, and that when domesticated he is a great bather, and  may be seen in the half-light dashing in and out of the water as he  makes trips to and from the nest. After the young are hatched both old  and young disport themselves about the water until moulting time. She  advises: \"Do not let the Phoebes build under the hoods of your windows,  for their spongy nests harbor innumerable bird-lice, and under such  circumstances your fly-screens will become infested and the house  invaded.\"    In its native woods the nest is of moss, mud, and grass placed on a  rock, near and over running water; but in the vicinity of settlements  and villages it is built on a horizontal bridge beam, or on timber  supporting a porch or shed. The eggs are pure white, somewhat spotted.  The notes, to some ears, are _Phoebe, phoebe, pewit, phoebe!_ to others,  of somewhat duller sense of hearing, perhaps, _Pewee, pewee, pewee!_ We  confess to a fancy that the latter is the better imitation.          THE RUBY-CROWNED KINGLET.      Baskett says that the Kinglets come at a certain early spring date  before the leaves are fully expanded, and flutter upward, while they  take something from beneath the budding leaf or twig. It is a peculiar  motion, which with their restless ways, olive-green color, and small  size, readily distinguishes them. It is rare that one is still. \"But the  ruby-crowned sometimes favors me with a song, and as it is a little  long, he usually is quiet till done. It is one of the sweetest little  lullaby-like strains. One day I saw him in the rose bush just near  voluntarily expand the plumage of his crown and show the brilliant  golden-ruby feathers beneath. Usually they are mostly concealed. It was  a rare treat, and visible to me only because of my rather exalted view.  He generally reserves this display for his mate, but he was here among  some Snow-birds and Tree Sparrows, and seemed to be trying to make these  plain folks envious of the pretty feathers in his hat.\"    These wonderfully dainty little birds are of great value to the farmer  and the fruit grower, doing good work among all classes of fruit trees  by killing grubs and larvae. In spite of their value in this respect,  they have been, in common with many other attractive birds, recklessly  killed for millinery purposes.    It is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30523"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#4)"],[1," some species of water snakes, and has no doubt more  than once left the impression on the mind of the superstitious sailor  that he has seen a veritable sea serpent, the fear of which lead him to  exaggerate the size of it.    This bird so strange in looks and action is common in summer in the  South Atlantic and Gulf States, frequenting the almost impenetrable  swamps, and is a constant resident of Florida.    As a diver the Snake Bird is the most wonderful of all the Ducks. Like  the Loon it can disappear instantly and noiselessly, swim a long  distance and reappear almost in an opposite direction to that in which  naturally it would be supposed to go. And the ease with which, when  alarmed, it will drop from its perch and leave scarcely a ripple on the  surface of the water, would appear incredible in so large a bird, were  it not a well known fact. It has also the curious habit of sinking like  a Grebe.    The nests of the Anhinga are located in various places, sometimes in low  bushes at a height from the ground of only a few feet, or in the upper  branches of high trees, but always over water. Though web footed, it is  strong enough to grasp tightly the perch on which it nests. This gives  it a great advantage over the common Duck which can nest only on the  ground. Sometimes Snake Birds breed in colonies with various species of  Herons. From three to five eggs, bluish, or dark greenish white, are  usually found in the nest.    Prof. F. C. Baker, secretary of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, to whom  we are indebted for the specimen presented here, captured this bird at  Micco, Brevard Co., Florida, in April, 1889. He says he found a peculiar  parasite in the brain of the Anhinga.    The Anhingas consist of but one species, which has a representative in  the warmer parts of each of the great divisions of the earth. The number  seen together varies from eight or ten to several hundred.    The hair-like feathers on the neck form a sort of loose mane.    When asleep the bird stands with its body almost erect. In rainy weather  it often spends the greater part of the day in an erect attitude, with  its neck and head stretched upward, remaining perfectly motionless, so  that the water may glide off its plumage. The fluted tail is very thick  and beautiful and serves as a propeller as well as a rudder in  swimming.          THE AMERICAN WOODCOCK.      Isn't this American Woodcock, or indeed any member of the family, a  comical bird? His head is almost square, and what a remarkable eye he  has! It is a seeing eye, too, for he does not require light to enable  him to detect the food he seeks in the bogs. He has many names to  characterize him, such as Bog-sucker, Mud Snipe, Blind Snipe. His  greatest enemies are the pot hunters, who nevertheless have nothing but  praise to bestow upon him, his flesh is so exquisitely palatable. Even  those who deplore and deprecate the destruction of birds are not  unappreciative of his good qualities in this respect.    The Woodcock inhabits eastern North America, the north British  provinces, the Dakotas, Nebraska and Kansas, and breeds throughout the  range.    Night is the time when the Woodcock enjoys life. He never flies  voluntarily by day, but remains secluded in close and sheltered thickets  till twilight, when he seeks his favorite feeding places. His sight is  imperfect by day, but at night he readily secures his food, assisted  doubtless by an extraordinary sense of smell. His remarkably large and  handsome eye is too sensitive for the glare of the sun, and during the  greater part of the day he remains closely concealed in marshy thickets  or in rank grass. In the morning and evening twilight and on moonlight  nights, he seeks his food in open places. The early riser may find him  with ease, but the first glow from the rays of the morning sun will  cause his disappearance from the landscape.    He must be looked for in swamps, and in meadows with soft bottoms.  During very wet seasons he seeks higher land--usually cornfields--and  searches for food in the mellow plowed ground, where his presence is  indicated by holes made by his bill. In seasons of excessive drought the  Woodcock resorts in large numbers to tide water creeks and the banks of  fresh water rivers. So averse is he to an excess of water, that after  continued or very heavy rains he has been known suddenly to disappear  from widely extended tracts of country.    A curious habit of the Woodcock, and one that is comparatively little  known, is that of carrying its young in order to remove them from  danger. So many trustworthy naturalists maintain this to be true that it  must be accepted as characteristic of this interesting bird. She takes  her young from place to place in her toe grasps as scarcity of food or  safety may require.    As in the case of many birds whose colors adapt them to certain  localities or conditions of existence, the patterns of the beautiful  chestnut parts of the Woodcock mimic well the dead leaves and serve to  protect the female and her young. The whistle made by their wings when  flying is a manifestation of one of the intelligences of nature.    The male Woodcock, it is believed, when he gets his \"intended\" off  entirely to himself, exhibits in peculiar dances and jigs that he is  hers and hers only, or rises high on the wing cutting the most peculiar  capers and gyrations in the air, protesting to her in the grass beneath  the most earnest devotion, or advertising to her his whereabouts.           [Illustration From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences.                 AMERICAN WOODCOCK.]    THE WOODCOCK.      Here is a bird that is not often seen in the daytime. During the day he  stays in the deep woods or among the tall marsh grasses.    It is at twilight that you may see him. He then comes out in search of  food.    Isn't he an odd-looking bird? His bill is made long so that he can bore  into the soft ground for earthworms.    You notice his color is much like the Ruffed Grouse in June \"BIRDS.\"  This seems to be the color of a great many birds whose home is among the  grasses and dried leaves. Maybe you can see a reason for this.    Those who have watched the Woodcock carefully, say that he can move the  tip end of the upper part of his bill. This acts like a finger in  helping him to draw his food from the ground.    What a sight it must be to see a number of these queer looking birds at  work getting their food. If they happen to be in a swampy place, they  often find earthworms by simply turning over the dead leaves.    If there should be, near by, a field that has been newly plowed, they  will gather in numbers, at twilight, and search for worms.    The Woodcock has short wings for his size. He seems to be able to fly  very fast. You can imagine how he looks while flying--his long bill out  in front and his legs hanging down.          THE AMERICAN SCOTER.      The specimen we give of the American Scoter is one of unusual rarity and  beauty of plumage. It was seen off the government pier, in Chicago, in  November, 1895, and has been much admired.    The Scoter has as many names as characteristics, being called the Sea  Coot, the Butter-billed, and the Hollow-billed Coot. The plumage of the  full grown male is entirely black, while the female is a sooty brown,  becoming paler below. She is also somewhat smaller.    This Duck is sometimes found in great numbers along the entire Atlantic  coast where it feeds on small shell fish which it secures by diving. A  few nest in Labrador, and in winter it is found in New Jersey, on the  Great Lakes, and in California. The neighborhoods of marshes and ponds  are its haunts, and in the Hudson Bay region the Scoter nests in June  and July.    The nest is built on the ground near water. Coarse grass, feathers, and  down are commonly used to make it comfortable, while it is well secreted  in hollows in steep banks and cliffs. The eggs are from six to ten, of a  dull buff color.    Prof. Cooke states that on May 2, 1883, fifty of these ducks were seen  at Anna, Union county, Illinois, all busily engaged in picking up millet  seed that had just been sown. If no mistake of identification was made  in this case, the observation apparently reveals a new fact in the  habits of the species, which has been supposed to feed exclusively in  the water, and to subsist generally on fishes and other aquatic animal  food.     [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  WHITE-WINGED SCOTER.]          OLD ABE.    \"I'd rather capture Old Abe,\" said Gen. Sterling Price, of the  Confederate Army, \"than a whole brigade.\"      \"Old Abe\" was the live war Eagle which accompanied the Eighth Wisconsin  regiment during the War of the Rebellion. Much of a more or less  problematical character has been written about him, but what we regard  as authentic we shall present in this article. Old Abe was a fine  specimen of the Bald Eagle, very like the one figured in this number of  BIRDS. Various stories are told of his capture, but the most trustworthy  account is that Chief Sky, a Chippewa Indian, took him from the nest  while an Eaglet. The nest was found on a pine tree in the Chippewa  country, about three miles from the mouth of the Flambeau, near some  rapids in the river. He and another Indian cut the tree down, and, amid  the menaces of the parent birds, secured two young Eagles about the size  of Prairie Hens. One of them died. The other, which lived to become  historical, was sold to Daniel McCann for a bushel of corn. McCann  carried it to Eau Claire, and presented it to a company then being  organized as a part of the Eighth Wisconsin Infantry.    What more appropriate emblem than the American Bald-headed Bird could  have been thus selected by the patriots who composed this regiment of  freemen! The Golden Eagle (of which we shall hereafter present a  splendid specimen,) with extended wings, was the ensign of the Persian  monarchs, long before it"]]]
