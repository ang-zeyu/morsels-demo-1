He bought a black bull, the son of a black cow  with white legs, white belly and part of the tail white; and in 1870 a calf  the gr.-gr.-gr.-gr.-grandchild of this cow was born coloured in the same very  peculiar manner; all the intermediate offspring having been black. In these  cases there can hardly be a doubt that a character derived from a cross with  an individual of the same variety reappeared after passing over three  generations in the one case, and five in the other.    When two distinct races are crossed, it is notorious that the tendency in the  offspring to revert to one or both parent-forms is strong, and endures for  many generations. I have myself seen the clearest evidence of this in crossed  pigeons and with various plants. Mr. Sidney (13/17. In his edition of 'Youatt  on the Pig' 1860 page 27.) states that, in a litter of Essex pigs, two young  ones appeared which were the image of the Berkshire boar that had been used  twenty-eight years before in giving size and constitution to the breed. I  observed in the farmyard at Betley Hall some fowls showing a strong likeness  to the Malay breed, and was told by Mr. Tollet that he had forty years before  crossed his birds with Malays; and that, though he had at first attempted to  get rid of this strain, he had subsequently given up the attempt in despair,  as the Malay character would reappear.    This strong tendency in crossed breeds to revert has given rise to endless  discussions in how many generations after a single cross, either with a  distinct breed or merely with an inferior animal, the breed may be considered  as pure, and free from all danger of reversion. No one supposes that less than  three generations suffices, and most breeders think that six, seven, or eight  are necessary, and some go to still greater lengths. (13/18. Dr. P. Lucas,  'Hered. Nat.' tome 2 pages 314, 892: see a good practical article on the  subject in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1856 page 620. I could add a vast number of  references, but they would be superfluous.) But neither in the case of a breed  which has been contaminated by a single cross, nor when, in the attempt to  form an intermediate breed, half-bred animals have been matched together  during many generations, can any rule be laid down how soon the tendency to  reversion will be obliterated. It depends on the difference in the strength or  prepotency of transmission in the two parent-forms, on their actual amount of  difference, and on the nature of the conditions of life to which the crossed  offspring are exposed. But we must be careful not to confound these cases of  reversion to characters which were gained by a cross, with those under the  first class, in which characters originally common to BOTH parents, but lost  at some former period, reappear; for such characters may recur after an almost  indefinite number of generations.    The law of reversion is as powerful with hybrids, when they are sufficiently  fertile to breed together, or when they are repeatedly crossed with either  pure parent-form, as in the case of mongrels. It is not necessary to give  instances. With plants almost every one who has worked on this subject, from  the time of Kolreuter to the present day, has insisted on this tendency.  Gartner has recorded some good instances; but no one has given more striking  ones than Naudin. (13/19. Kolreuter gives curious cases in his 'Dritte  Fortsetzung' 1766 ss. 53, 59; and in his well-known 'Memoirs on Lavatera and  Jalapa.' Gartner 'Bastarderzeugung' ss. 437, 441, etc. Naudin in his  \"Recherches sur l'Hybridite\" 'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page 25.)  The tendency differs in degree or strength in different groups, and partly  depends, as we shall presently see, on whether the parent-plants have been  long cultivated. Although the tendency to reversion is extremely general with  nearly all mongrels and hybrids, it cannot be considered as invariably  characteristic of them; it may also be mastered by long-continued selection;  but these subjects will more properly be discussed in a future chapter on  Crossing. From what we see of the power and scope of reversion, both in pure  races, and when varieties or species are crossed, we may infer that characters  of almost every kind are capable of reappearing after having been lost for a  great length of time. But it does not follow from this that in each particular  case certain characters will reappear; for instance, this will not occur when  a race is crossed with another endowed with prepotency of transmission.  Sometimes the power of reversion wholly fails, without our being able to  assign any cause for the failure: thus it has been stated that in a French  family in which 85 out of above 600 members, during six generations, had been  subject to night-blindness, \"there has not been a single example of this  affection in the children of parents who were themselves free from it.\"  (13/20. Quoted by Mr. Sedgwick in 'Med.-Chirurg. Review' April 1861 page 485.  Dr. H. Dobell in 'Med.-Chirurg. Transactions' volume 46 gives an analogous  case in which, in a large family, fingers with thickened joints were  transmitted to several members during five generations; but when the blemish  once disappeared it never reappeared.)    REVERSION THROUGH BUD-PROPAGATION--PARTIAL REVERSION, BY SEGMENTS IN THE SAME  FLOWER OR FRUIT, OR IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY IN THE SAME INDIVIDUAL  ANIMAL.    In the eleventh chapter many cases of reversion by buds, independently of  seminal generation, were given--as when a leaf-bud on a variegated, a curled,  or laciniated variety suddenly reassumes its proper character; or as when a  Provence-rose appears on a moss-rose, or a peach on a nectarine-tree. In some  of these cases only half the flower or fruit, or a smaller segment, or mere  stripes, reassume their former character; and here we have reversion by  segments. Vilmorin (13/21. Verlot 'Des Varietes' 1865 page 63.) has also  recorded several cases with plants derived from seed, of flowers reverting by  stripes or blotches to their primitive colours: he states that in all such  cases a white or pale-coloured variety must first be formed, and, when this is  propagated for a length of time by seed, striped seedlings occasionally make  their appearance; and these can afterwards by care be multiplied by seed.    The stripes and segments just referred to are not due, as far as is known, to  reversion to characters derived from a cross, but to characters lost by  variation. These cases, however, as Naudin (13/22. 'Nouvelles Archives du  Museum' tome 1 page 25. Alex. Braun (in his 'Rejuvenescence' Ray Soc. 1853  page 315) apparently holds a similar opinion.) insists in his discussion on  disjunction of character, are closely analogous with those given in the  eleventh chapter, in which crossed plants have been known to produce half-and-  half or striped flowers and fruit, or distinct kinds of flowers on the same  root resembling the two parent-forms. Many piebald animals probably come under  this same head. Such cases, as we shall see in the chapter on Crossing,  apparently result from certain characters not readily blending together, and,  as a consequence of this incapacity for fusion, the offspring either perfectly  resemble one of their two parents, or resemble one parent in one part, and the  other parent in another part; or whilst young are intermediate in character,  but with advancing age revert wholly or by segments to either parent-form, or  to both. Thus, young trees of the Cytisus adami are intermediate in foliage  and flowers between the two parent-forms; but when older the buds continually  revert either partially or wholly to both forms. The cases given in the  eleventh chapter on the changes which occurred during growth in crossed plants  of Tropaeolum, Cereus, Datura, and Lathyrus are all analogous. As, however,  these plants are hybrids of the first generation, and as their buds after a  time come to resemble their parents and not their grandparents, these cases do  not at first appear to come under the law of reversion in the ordinary sense  of the word; nevertheless, as the change is effected through a succession of  bud-generations on the same plant, they may be thus included.    Analogous facts have been observed in the animal kingdom, and are more  remarkable, as they occur in the same individual in the strictest sense, and  not as with plants through a succession of bud-generations. With animals the  act of reversion, if it can be so designated, does not pass over a true  generation, but merely over the early stages of growth in the same individual.  For instance, I crossed several white hens with a black cock, and many of the  chickens were, during the first year, perfectly white, but acquired during the  second year black feathers; on the other hand, some of the chickens which were  at first black, became during the second year piebald with white. A great  breeder (13/23. Mr. Teebay in 'The Poultry Book' by Mr. Tegetmeier 1866 page  72.) says, that a Pencilled Brahma hen which has any of the blood of the Light  Brahma in her, will \"occasionally produce a pullet well pencilled during the  first year, but she will most likely moult brown on the shoulders and become  quite unlike her original colours in the second year.\" The same thing occurs  with light Brahmas if of impure blood. I have observed exactly similar cases  with the crossed offspring from differently coloured pigeons. But here is a  more remarkable fact: I crossed a turbit, which has a frill formed by the  feathers being reversed on its breast, with a trumpeter; and one of the young  pigeons thus raised at first showed not a trace of the frill, but, after  moulting thrice, a small yet unmistakably distinct frill appeared on its  breast. According to Girou (13/24. Quoted by Hofacker 'Ueber die  Eigenschaften' etc. s. 98.) calves produced from a red cow by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28752"],[0,"Pleasures of the telescope (#4)"],[1,"be if the same gradation applied to it as applies to the  inner rings, and it is surrounded, moreover, on its outer edge by a  slight flare which tends to increase its apparent width. Next let us  return to the focus and then move the eyepiece gradually inside the  focal point or plane. Once more the star disk expands into a series of  circles, and, if we except the color phenomena noticed outside the  focus, these circles are precisely like those seen before in  arrangement, in size, and in brightness. If they were not the same, we  should pronounce the telescope to be imperfect. There is one other  difference, however, besides the absence of the blue central flare, and  that is a faint reddish edging around the outer ring when the expansion  inside the focus is not carried very far. Upon continuing to move the  eyepiece inside or outside the focus we observe that the system of rings  becomes larger, while the rings themselves rapidly increase in number,  becoming at the same time individually thinner and fainter.    [Illustration: THE STAR IMAGE.]    By studying the appearance of the star disk when in focus and of the  rings when out of focus on either side, an experienced eye can readily  detect any fault that a telescope may have. The amateur, of course, can  only learn to do this by considerable practice. Any glaring and serious  fault, however, will easily make itself manifest. Suppose, for example,  we observe that the image of a star instead of being perfectly round is  oblong, and that a similar defect appears in the form of the rings when  the eyepiece is put out of focus. We know at once that something is  wrong; but the trouble may lie either in the object glass, in the  eyepiece, in the eye of the observer himself, or in the adjustment of  the lenses in the tube. A careful examination of the image and the  out-of-focus circles will enable us to determine with which of these  sources of error we have to deal. If the star image when in focus has a  sort of wing on one side, and if the rings out of focus expand  eccentrically, appearing wider and larger on one side than on the other,  being at the same time brightest on the least expanded side, then the  object glass is probably not at right angles to the axis of the tube and  requires readjustment. That part of the object glass on the side where  the rings appear most expanded and faintest needs to be pushed slightly  inward. This can be effected by means of counterscrews placed for that  purpose in or around the cell. But it, after we have got the object  glass properly squared to the axis of the tube or the line of sight, the  image and the ring system in and out of focus still appear oblong, the  fault of astigmatism must exist either in the objective, the eyepiece,  or the eye. The chances are very great that it is the eye itself that is  at fault. We may be certain of this if we find, on turning the head so  as to look into the telescope with the eye in different positions, that  the oblong image turns with the head of the observer, keeping its major  axis continually in the same relative position with respect to the eye.  The remedy then is to consult an oculist and get a pair of cylindrical  eyeglasses. If the oblong image does not turn round with the eye, but  does turn when the eyepiece is twisted round, then the astigmatism is in  the latter. If, finally, it does not follow either the eye or the  eyepiece, it is the objective that is at fault.    But instead of being oblong, the image and the rings may be misshapen in  some other way. If they are three-cornered, it is probable that the  object glass is subjected to undue pressure in its cell. This, if the  telescope has been brought out on a cool night from a warm room, may  arise from the unequal contraction of the metal work and the glass as  they cool off. In fact, no good star image can be got while a telescope  is assuming the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. Even the air  inclosed in the tube is capable of making much trouble until its  temperature has sunk to the level of that outside. Half an hour at least  is required for a telescope to adjust itself to out-of-door temperature,  except in the summer time, and it is better to allow an hour or two for  such adjustment in cold weather. Any irregularity in the shape of the  rings which persists after the lenses have been accurately adjusted and  the telescope has properly cooled may be ascribed to imperfections, such  as veins or spots of unequal density in the glass forming the objective.    [Illustration: THE OUT-OF-FOCUS RINGS.    1, Correct figure; 2 and 3, spherical aberration.]    The spherical aberration of an object glass may be undercorrected or  overcorrected. In the former case the central rings inside the focus  will appear faint and the outer ones unduly strong, while outside the  focus the central rings will be too bright and the outer ones too  feeble. But if the aberration is overcorrected the central rings will be  overbright inside the focus and abnormally faint outside the focus.    [Illustration: TWO VIEWS OF MARS IN 1892.    The smaller with a three-and-three-eighths-inch telescope; the larger  with a nine-inch.]    Assuming that we have a telescope in which no obvious fault is  discernible, the next thing is to test its powers in actual work. In  what is to follow I shall endeavor to describe some of the principal  objects in the heavens from which the amateur observer may expect to  derive pleasure and instruction, and which may at the same time serve  as tests of the excellence of his telescope. No one should be deterred  or discouraged in the study of celestial objects by the apparent  insignificance of his means of observation. The accompanying pictures of  the planet Mars may serve as an indication of the fact that a small  telescope is frequently capable of doing work that appears by no means  contemptible when placed side by side with that of the greater  instruments of the observatories.          CHAPTER II    IN THE STARRY HEAVENS    \"Now constellations, Muse, and signs rehearse;  In order let them sparkle in thy verse.\"--MANILIUS.      Let us imagine ourselves the happy possessors of three properly mounted  telescopes of five, four, and three inches aperture, respectively. A  fine midwinter evening has come along, the air is clear, cool, and  steady, and the heavens, of that almost invisible violet which is  reserved for the lovers of celestial scenery, are spangled with stars  that hardly twinkle. We need not disturb our minds about a few thin  clouds here and there floating lazily in the high air; they announce a  change of weather, but they will not trouble us to-night.    Which way shall we look? Our eyes will answer the question for us.  However we may direct them, they instinctively return to the south, and  are lifted to behold Orion in his glory, now near the meridian and  midway to the zenith, with Taurus shaking the glittering Pleiades before  him, and Canis Major with the flaming Dog Star following at his heels.    Not only is Orion the most brilliant of all constellations to the casual  star-gazer, but it contains the richest mines that the delver for  telescopic treasures can anywhere discover. We could not have made a  better beginning, for here within a space of a few square degrees we  have a wonderful variety of double stars and multiple stars, so close  and delicate as to test the powers of the best telescopes, besides a  profusion of star-clusters and nebulae, including one of the supreme  marvels of space, the Great Nebula in the Sword.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 1.]    Our star map No. 1 will serve as a guide to the objects which we are  about to inspect. Let us begin operations with our smallest telescope,  the three-inch. I may remark here that, just as the lowest magnifying  power that will clearly reveal the object looked for gives ordinarily  better results than a higher power, so the smallest telescope that is  competent to show what one wishes to see is likely to yield more  satisfaction, as far as that particular object is concerned, than a  larger glass. The larger the object glass and the higher the power, the  greater are the atmospheric difficulties. A small telescope will perform  very well on a night when a large one is helpless.    Turn the glass upon beta (Rigel), the white first-magnitude star in  Orion's left foot. Observe whether the image with a high power is clear,  sharp, and free from irregular wisps of stray light. Look at the rings  in and out of focus, and if you are satisfied with the performance, try  for the companion. A good three-inch is certain to show it, except in a  bad state of the atmosphere, and even then an expert can see it, at  least by glimpses. The companion is of the ninth magnitude, some say the  eighth, and the distance is about 9.5\", angle of position (hereafter  designated by p.) 199 deg..[1] Its color is blue, in decided contrast with  the white light of its great primary. Sir John Herschel, however, saw  the companion red, as others have done. These differences are doubtless  due to imperfections of the eye or the telescope. In 1871 Burnham  believed he had discovered that the companion was an exceedingly close  double star. No one except Burnham himself succeeded in dividing it, and  he could only do so at times. Afterward, when he was at Mount Hamilton,  he tried in vain to split it with the great thirty-six-inch telescope,  in 1889, 1890, and 1891. His want of success induced him to suggest that  the component stars were in rapid motion, and so, although he admitted  that it might not be double after all, he advised that it should be  watched for a few years longer. His confidence was justified, for in  1898 Aitken, with the Lick telescope, saw and measured the distance of  the extremely minute companion--distance 0.17\", p. 177 deg..
