The term is so far a  good one as it brings into connection the production of domestic races by  man's power of selection, and the natural preservation of varieties and  species in a state of nature. For brevity sake I sometimes speak of natural  selection as an intelligent power;--in the same way as astronomers speak of  the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets, or as  agriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of  selection. In the one case, as in the other, selection does nothing without  variability, and this depends in some manner on the action of the  surrounding circumstances on the organism. I have, also, often personified  the word Nature; for I have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity; but  I mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural  laws,--and by laws only the ascertained sequence of events.    It has been shown from many facts that the largest amount of life can be  supported on each area, by great diversification or divergence in the  structure and constitution of its inhabitants. We have, also, seen that the  continued production of new forms through natural selection, which implies  that each new variety has some advantage over others, inevitably leads to  the extermination of the older and less improved forms. These latter are  almost necessarily intermediate in structure, as well as in descent,  between the last-produced forms and their original parent-species. Now, if  we suppose a species to produce two or more varieties, and these in the  course of time to produce other varieties, the principal of good being  derived from diversification of structure will generally lead to the  preservation of the most divergent varieties; thus the lesser differences  characteristic of varieties come to be augmented into the greater  differences characteristic of species, and, by the extermination of the  older intermediate forms, new species end by being distinctly defined  objects. Thus, also, we shall see how it is that organic beings can be  classed by what is called a natural method in distinct groups--species  under genera, and genera under families.    As all the inhabitants of each country may be said, owing to their high  rate of reproduction, to be striving to increase in numbers; as each form  comes into competition with many other forms in the struggle for life,--for  destroy any one and its place will be seized by others; as every part of  the organisation occasionally varies in some slight degree, and as natural  selection acts exclusively by the preservation of variations which are  advantageous under the excessively complex conditions to which each being  is exposed, no limit exists to the number, singularity, and perfection of  the contrivances and co-adaptations which may thus be produced. An animal  or a plant may thus slowly become related in its structure and habits in  the most intricate manner to many other animals and plants, and to the  physical conditions of its home. Variations in the organisation will in  some cases be aided by habit, or by the use and disuse of parts, and they  will be governed by the direct action of the surrounding physical  conditions and by correlation of growth.    On the principles here briefly sketched out, there is no innate or  necessary tendency in each being to its own advancement in the scale of  organisation. We are almost compelled to look at the specialisation or  differentiation of parts or organs for different functions as the best or  even sole standard of advancement; for by such division of labour each  function of body and mind is better performed. And as natural selection  acts exclusively through the preservation of profitable modifications of  structure, and as the conditions of life in each area generally become more  and more complex from the increasing number of different forms which  inhabit it and from most of these forms acquiring a more and more perfect  structure, we may confidently believe, that, on the whole, organisation  advances. Nevertheless a very simple form fitted for very simple conditions  of life might remain for indefinite ages unaltered or unimproved; for what  would it profit an infusorial animalcule, for instance, or an intestinal  worm, to become highly organised? Members of a high group might even  become, and this apparently has often occurred, fitted for simpler  conditions of life; and in this case natural selection would tend to  simplify or degrade the organisation, for complicated mechanism for simple  actions would be useless or even disadvantageous.    The arguments opposed to the theory of Natural Selection, have been  discussed in my 'Origin of Species,' as far as the size of that work  permitted, under the following heads: the difficulty in understanding how  very simple organs have been converted by small and graduated steps into  highly perfect and complex organs; the marvellous facts of Instinct; the  whole question of Hybridity; and, lastly, the absence in our known  geological formations of innumerable links connecting all allied species.  Although some of these difficulties are of great weight, we shall see that  many of them are explicable on the theory of natural selection, and are  otherwise inexplicable.    In scientific investigations it is permitted to invent any hypothesis, and  if it explains various large and independent classes of facts it rises to  the rank of a well-grounded theory. The undulations of the ether and even  its existence are hypothetical, yet every one now admits the undulatory  theory of light. The principle of natural selection may be looked at as a  mere hypothesis, but rendered in some degree probable by what we positively  know of the variability of organic beings in a state of nature,--by what we  positively know of the struggle for existence, and the consequent almost  inevitable preservation of favourable variations,--and from the analogical  formation of domestic races. Now this hypothesis may be tested,--and this  seems to me the only fair and legitimate manner of considering the whole  question,--by trying whether it explains several large and independent  classes of facts; such as the geological succession of organic beings,  their distribution in past and present times, and their mutual affinities  and homologies. If the principle of natural selection does explain these  and other large bodies of facts, it ought to be received. On the ordinary  view of each species having been independently created, we gain no  scientific explanation of any one of these facts. We can only say that it  has so pleased the Creator to command that the past and present inhabitants  of the world should appear in a certain order and in certain areas; that He  has impressed on them the most extraordinary resemblances, and has classed  them in groups subordinate to groups. But by such statements we gain no new  knowledge; we do not connect together facts and laws; we explain nothing.    It was the consideration of such large groups of facts as these which first  led me to take up the present subject. When I visited during the voyage of  H.M.S. \"Beagle,\" the Galapagos Archipelago, situated in the Pacific Ocean  about 500 miles from South America, I found myself surrounded by peculiar  species of birds, reptiles, and plants, existing nowhere else in the world.  Yet they nearly all bore an American stamp. In the song of the mocking-  thrush, in the harsh cry of the carrion-hawk, in the great candlestick-like  opuntias, I clearly perceived the neighbourhood of America, though the  islands were separated by so many miles of ocean from the mainland, and  differed much in their geological constitution and climate. Still more  surprising was the fact that most of the inhabitants of each separate  island in this small archipelago were specifically different, though most  closely related to each other. The archipelago, with its innumerable  craters and bare streams of lava, appeared to be of recent origin; and thus  I fancied myself brought near to the very act of creation. I often asked  myself how these many peculiar animals and plants had been produced: the  simplest answer seemed to be that the inhabitants of the several islands  had descended from each other, undergoing modification in the course of  their descent; and that all the inhabitants of the archipelago were  descended from those of the nearest land, namely America, whence colonists  would naturally have been derived. But it long remained to me an  inexplicable problem how the necessary degree of modification could have  been effected, and it would have thus remained for ever, had I not studied  domestic productions, and thus acquired a just idea of the power of  Selection. As soon as I had fully realised this idea, I saw, on reading  Malthus on Population, that Natural Selection was the inevitable result of  the rapid increase of all organic beings; for I was prepared to appreciate  the struggle for existence by having long studied the habits of animals.    Before visiting the Galapagos I had collected many animals whilst  travelling from north to south on both sides of America, and everywhere,  under conditions of life as different as it is possible to conceive,  American forms were met with--species replacing species of the same  peculiar genera. Thus it was when the Cordilleras were ascended, or the  thick tropical forests penetrated, or the fresh waters of America searched.  Subsequently I visited other countries, which in all their conditions of  life were incomparably more like parts of South America, than the different  parts of that continent are to each other; yet in these countries, as in  Australia or Southern Africa, the traveller cannot fail to be struck with  the entire difference of their productions. Again the reflection was forced  on me that community of descent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28711"],[0,"Operas Every Child Should Know (#4)"],[1,"with vows no maiden heart could withstand         They pledged their faith to me.         And I dreamt that one of that noble host         Came forth my hand to claim,       But I also dreamt (which pleased me most)         That you loved me still the same.    When she had ceased to sing, Thaddeus embraced her tenderly and  assured her that he should love her always, \"still the same.\"    Arline had often been troubled because of some difference between  herself and the gipsies, and she had also been curious about a scar  which was upon her arm. So upon that night she questioned Thaddeus  about this, and he told her of the accident in the forest twelve years  before, when she got the wound upon her arm. However, he did not  reveal to her that she was the daughter of a noble.    \"Thou wert but six years old when this accident befell thee,\" Thaddeus  told her. But Arline was not yet satisfied.    \"There is more to tell! I know that I am not of this gipsy band--nor  art thou!--I feel that this is true, Thaddeus. Wilt thou not tell me  the secret if there is one?\" and Thaddeus had decided that he would do  this, when the curtains at the back of the Queen's tent were parted  and the gipsy Queen herself appeared.    \"Do you dare throw yourself into the arms of this man, when I love  him?\" the Queen demanded angrily, at which Arline and Thaddeus were  thrown into consternation. But Arline had plenty of courage,  especially after what had just happened; hence she appealed to  Thaddeus himself. He declared his love for her, and the two called for  their comrades. All ran in and asked what the excitement was about.    Arline declared to them that she and Thaddeus loved each other and  wished to be married--which pleased Devilshoof mightily. All life was  a joke to him, and he knew perfectly that the Queen was in love with  Thaddeus.    \"Ho, ho,\" he laughed. \"Now we shall have everybody by the ears. Come!\"  he cried to the Queen. \"As queen of the gipsies, it is your business  to unite this handsome pair. We are ready for the ceremony,\" and they  all laughed and became uproarious. The Queen's pride would not let her  ignore the challenge, so she advanced haughtily and took the hands of  the lovers.         \"Hand to hand and heart to heart,       Who shall those I've united part?\"    she chanted; and with this gipsy rite, they were united.    Then the band sat down in groups and made merry; but the Queen began  to plot revenge against Arline.    While they lounged about, prolonging the revel, a gipsy entered and  told them that day was dawning, and that already the people of the  city were awake and wending their way to a fair which the gipsies were  bound for; and if they were to make anything by their dances and  tricks they had better be up and doing.    \"Up, all of you!\" cried the moody Queen, \"and meet me in the public  square; while you, Devilshoof, stay behind for further orders.\"  Whereupon all went down the street, Thaddeus and Arline hand in hand.    As soon as the last gipsy had disappeared, the Queen turned on  Devilshoof. \"Now, then--that thing you are wearing about your  neck--that medallion you stole! hand it over; and as for what has just  happened, I shall not forget the part you had in it--it was you who  urged the marriage and compelled me to perform it or else betray  myself! You shall pay for this. Meantime, see that you take nothing  more that doesn't belong to you,\" and she snatched the medallion from  him. This did not endear her to Devilshoof, and he determined to have  his revenge.    \"Now be off and join the rest!\" she cried; and while she left the  square by one route Devilshoof departed by another.    After going a little way, Devilshoof was certain to come up with those  who had gone before and who were dancing along, in front of Arline and  Thaddeus, singing gaily about the wedding.         Come with the gipsy bride,         And repair         To the fair.       Where the mazy dance         Will the hours entrance.       Come with the gipsy bride,         Where souls as light preside.    Thus they pranced along having a fine gipsy time of it till they  arrived at the fair, which was held in a great public square in the  midst of the city. The courthouse was on one side, and over the door  there was a sign which read \"The Hall of Justice.\" Everybody seemed to  be at the fair: peasants, nobles, soldiers, and citizens;  rope-dancers, quack doctors, waxworks, showmen of all sorts, and bells  rang and flags flew, and altogether it was just the thing for a  gipsy's wedding day.    The quack doctor blew his horn, and everybody surged about him, and  while all that movement and fun were taking place, Devilshoof and  Thaddeus formed a sort of flying wedge on the outskirts of the crowd  and forced a passage for the gipsy band. At that moment Florestein  came along, taking part in the day as all the rest of Presburg were  doing, and the first man his eye lighted upon was that miscreant,  Devilshoof. There stood the man who had stolen his medallion! There  were several gentlemen with Florestein, and he called their attention  to the gipsy group. Meantime Arline, like any gipsy, had been going  about selling flowers and telling fortunes, and while those things  were taking place the old Count Arnheim and some officers of the city  entered and tried to pass through the group to the courthouse, where  the old Count presided as judge. Florestein stopped him.    \"Uncle, just stop a bit and look at those gipsies! Do you see that  pretty girl? I am delighted with her. Even an old gentleman like you  should have an eye to a girl as pretty as that,\" he laughed. This was  not in very good taste, but then, nobody ever accused the little idiot  of having either good taste or good courage.    \"I have no eyes for beauty since my Arline was lost to me, nephew,\"  the old man returned sadly, and passed to his courtroom. But  Florestein pressed through the crowd till he reached Arline's side.    \"You are a pretty girl,\" he said boldly, ogling her. \"Come! you are  teaching others\" (Arline had been telling a fortune), \"teach me.\"    \"A lesson in politeness, sir?--you need it,\" and Arline slapped his  face; not at all the sort of thing a countess would do, but then she  had been brought up a gipsy, and couldn't be expected to have all the  graces of her ancestors. The Queen, who had been watching, ready to  make trouble, called Thaddeus's attention to the incident, and  Thaddeus shouldered his way through the crowd just in time to slap  Florestein's face from the other side, as he turned about. The fop was  somewhat disturbed, while Arline and Thaddeus burst out laughing at  him. The Queen, watching this episode, recognized in Florestein the  chap to whom she had restored the trinkets. She herself had the  medallion, and instantly a malicious thought occurred to her: it was  her opportunity to revenge herself on Arline for loving Thaddeus. She  approached Arline, and held out the medallion.    \"You should be rewarded, my girl, for giving this presumptuous fellow  a lesson. Take this from me, and think of it as my wedding gift,\" and  she left the medallion with Arline. The girl was very grateful and  kissed the Queen's hand.    \"Now we must go! call the band together,\" she commanded, leading the  way; and slowly they all assembled and prepared to go. Thaddeus hung  the medallion on Arline's neck and, with her, came last of the band.  Now Florestein, smarting under their blows, saw the medallion on  Arline's neck and at once drew the attention of his friends to it.  They recognized it as his. He then went up to Thaddeus and Arline and  pointed to the trinket.    \"You may stay awhile, my girl. How about that medallion of mine which  you have on your neck? My friends here recognize it!\"    \"The Queen has given it to me--only now,\" she replied in amazement;  but as she looked about she saw that the Queen was gone, and  Devilshoof, who had witnessed all, was then sneaking off.    \"That is a good story. We have all heard that sort of thing before.  Come along,\" and he would have arrested her instantly, but Thaddeus  sprang forward and took a hand in the matter. When Florestein saw the  affair had grown serious he ran into the Hall of Justice, and returned  with a guard who arrested the girl. Arline, in tears, declared her  innocence, but everything appeared against her. She had only Thaddeus  to stand by her, but at this crisis the other gipsies ran back,  hearing of the row, and tried to rescue her. There Thaddeus, too, was  seized, and a free fight took place in which the gipsies were driven  off; finally, Arline, left alone, was marched into the Hall of  Justice. The Queen then returned, and stood unseen, enjoying the young  girl's peril, while Thaddeus threatened everybody concerned.    Now before the guards reached the Count Arnheim's apartment where  Arline was to be tried, the Count had been sitting before a portrait  of his lost daughter, which pictured her as she was twelve years  before. He had never known a happy hour since her loss. As he looked  at her portrait he sang:    [Music:         The heart bow'd down by weight of woe,         To weakest hope will cling,       To tho't and impulse while they flow,         That can no comfort bring, that can, that can no comfort bring,       With those exciting scenes will blend,         O'er pleasure's pathway thrown;       But mem'ry is the only friend,         That grief can call its own,         That grief can call its own,         That grief can call its own.]         The mind will in its worst despair,         Still ponder o'er the past,       On moments of delight that were         Too beautiful to last.       To long departed years extend         Its visions with them flown;       For mem'ry is the only friend         That grief can call its own.    Thus, while the old Count's mind was lingering sadly over the past,  calling up visions of the hopes that had fled with"]]]
