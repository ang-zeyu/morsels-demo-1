[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29688"],[0,"Home Range and Movements of the Eastern Cottontail in Kansas (#4)"],[1,"to the most  reliable method (Composite Method) 30 male cottontails had home ranges  of between 0.46 acre and 12.19 acres and 24 female cottontails had home  ranges of between 0.46 acre and 12.62 acres. The average for males was  5.05 acres and the average for females was 4.81 acres. The average for  all 54 cottontails was 4.86 acres.    Because of irregularities in live-trapping and field observation some  cottontails were more intensively studied than were others; one  cottontail was followed one time only, while another was trapped 26  times, followed three times, and seen in the field six times. It was  necessary to determine which cottontails had been studied sufficiently  to determine the approximate extent of their home ranges.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Correlation between average size of home range  and number of \"peripheral points\" (marginal records, which form angles  when the range is outlined). On the average, a sufficient number of  records to yield approximately nine peripheral points must be obtained  before the full extent of the home range is revealed.]    The average area, in acres, of home range was plotted, on a graph,  against the number of peripheral points (Figure 1). When a home range  had nine or more peripheral points, on an average, the size of home  range did not increase significantly with additional captures,  observations in the field, or records of trails. Home ranges with less  than nine peripheral points were likely to be increased in size with  each new observation. A similar situation has been shown by previous  authors who have plotted the size of home range against number of  captures in live-traps, where only live-trapping was used to gather  data. Therefore, in my study, home ranges with nine or more peripheral  points were considered to be adequately studied.    Data for eighteen cottontails that had been studied sufficiently to  determine the full extent of their home ranges were used to calculate  minimum, maximum, and average home range by each of five methods (Table  1). The methods used by Schwartz (1941), Dalke and Sime (1938) and  Allen (1939) yielded results which were lower than any others,  presumably because only live-trap data were used and because straight  lines were used to connect traps in which cottontails were captured.  The \"composite method\" was considered the most reliable because it  utilized all data gathered for each individual and because with this  method the home range boundaries were drawn to enclose all areas in  which the cottontail lived and excluded all areas in which the  cottontail was not known to have been. The method used by Fitch (1949)  agreed most closely with the \"composite method\" and suggests to me that  the home range of animals can be estimated with reasonable accuracy by  this method when field observation or trailing are not feasible. The  composite method is superior to others for studying the home range and  movements of cottontails.    Of the individuals whose entire home ranges had been thoroughly  studied, nine males had home ranges of between 4.72 acres and 12.19  acres with an average of 8.92 acres; nine females had home ranges of  between 2.42 acres and 12.62 acres with an average of 7.76 acres. The  average size of home range for both sexes was 8.34 acres (Table 1).

Maps showing home ranges of cottontails in  relation to woodland and open fields on the study area. One inch equals  approximately 470 feet. Each home range is shown slightly rounded from  the polygonal figures obtained by connecting actual points where the  animal was recorded. _Upper Left._ An area of 4.6 acres occupied by a  cottontail in winter, increased to 6.5 acres in summer by the animal  crossing a narrow grassland strip to another woodland edge. _Lower  Left._ Showing increasing size of home range of a female cottontail; in  July, 1954 (at age of three weeks), she had a range of .25 acre;  September, 1954, 1.5 acres; December, 1954, 8 acres; and December,  1955, 11 acres. _Right Half._ Two home ranges of a cottontail which  moved from its original area to occupy a new one 410 feet farther north  across a field in September and October, 1955.]    Cottontails range over a larger area in summer than they do in winter  because suitable cover and food is more abundant in summer. One  cottontail (Figure 2, upper left) lived in a woodland home range of 4.6  acres in the winter but increased the range to 6.5 acres in summer by  crossing the narrow overgrown end of a field to another woodland area.  Another cottontail (Figure 3, top part) lived in a woodland home range  of 7.9 acres in winter but in summer increased the home range to 9.5  acres by including also a part of an adjacent field. Other cottontails  increased their home ranges in summer by five to 15 per cent.    On the average, male cottontails had a larger (by 13 per cent) home  range than females probably because of the increased activity of males  in the breeding season and the decreased activity of females when  pregnant and caring for young. Nevertheless, some of the largest home  ranges measured were those of females.    [Illustration: FIG 3. Diagrams showing home ranges of cottontails in  relation to woodland and open fields on the study area. One inch equals  approximately 545 feet. Each home range is shown slightly rounded from  the polygonal figures obtained by connecting actual points where the  animal was recorded. _Upper._ Winter range of 7.9 acres (solid line)  increased to 9.5 acres in summer by area in dashed line. _Lower._  Overlapping home ranges of four of the many cottontails living on the  study area. Each of the four cottontails occupied approximately the  same home range throughout the year.]    The size of the home range in immature cottontails varies between 0.1  acre and 4.0 acres, depending on the age and size of the individual.  Fourteen young cottontails between three and six weeks of age did not  leave areas of approximately one acre in each instance. Nine  cottontails between six weeks and 18 weeks of age lived in areas of  about two acres. By the time cottontails are four to five months old  they inhabit a home range of four to eight acres.    One cottontail (Figure 2, lower left) born in July, 1954, was estimated  to have wandered over approximately 0.25 acre at an age of three weeks.  In September this cottontail occupied a home range of one and one-half  acres. By December it was five months old and occupied an area of about  eight acres. In the next year it enlarged its home range to 11.5 acres.    The cottontail usually settles down in one area and stays there until  it dies. Changes from one home range to another are unusual, but minor  shifts, in response to changes in vegetation and weather, are common.  In one exceptional instance (Figure 2, right) a male cottontail,  occupying a home range of 11.2 acres in a woodland, suddenly shifted to  a new area that barely overlapped its former home range at one edge.  Two months after the change was first noticed the cottontail was living  in a new home range of 6.6 acres 300 feet from its original home range.  In changing from one home range to the other the cottontail traveled  along a dry stream bed and was captured there three times.    Maps of the home ranges of four of those 18 cottontails for which  sufficient data were collected to determine the size of home range are  shown in the lower part of Figure 3.      SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS    The home range and movements of the cottontail were studied on a  90-acre area of the University of Kansas Natural History Reservation  from February, 1954, to March, 1956. Eighty-nine cottontails were  identified in the field 59 times, trailed 70 times and captured in  live-traps 326 times in 7,850 trap nights. Home range of the cottontail  was calculated by five methods, using the same set of data, and the  results were compared. A composite method was used, which permitted the  use of more data than any other one method.    The maintenance of a home range is of survival value to the cottontail.  Knowledge of the home range is of value to man when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29691"],[0,"Taxidermy (#4)"],[1,"until dry.    To wrap the body feathers for keeping place until dry, stick two or  three long pins in back and breast, along center of both. These hold the  light wrapping of thread from slipping out of place as it goes on. Lay  the thread around the specimen lightly. If the wings do not set right  without other aid than the wire already in them, pin them with sharpened  wires, one through the double bone just forward of the wrist and one  through close forward of the elbow, running wires firmly into the body.  (For general details see Fig. 11.)    [Illustration: Fig. 11.]    To soak up a dried bird skin for preparation to mount, the simplest and  quickest means is immersion in a weak solution of carbolic acid in  water, leaving for a day or two until tissues are soft.    When the skin is relaxed so that wings and legs may be manipulated  without breaking, squeeze water from it and follow same method given for  cleaning a fresh skin. With this treatment a good dry skin will come out  as soft and workable as a fresh one. Arsenic and grease burnt skins are  hard to get much out of.    To make up dry bird skins for keeping to mount at a future time, follow  regular method of thorough skinning and cleaning. Apply dry arsenic  powder to inner surfaces. Wrap skull, wing, and leg bones lightly with  cotton or tow. Turn skin right side out and push a neck and light body  filling of fiber that will allow ventilation, into place. Arrange the  plumage and hang the skin up by a thread or cord sewn through neck at  base of skull.    To make a cabinet skin for study purposes, roll a neat body and neck of  material to suit size of bird, place it inside the skin, stitch incision  together, plug eye sockets with cotton, tie the elbows together on the  body with a loop sewn through the back, tie bill shut, adjust feathers  neatly and lay the specimen in a hollowed bed made of a piece of wire  netting bent to size. See that wings cover back neatly. Lay head of  short necked bird out straight, neck somewhat shorter than natural, and  of long necked specimen along right side, looped to body with cord sewn  through neck and side. Cross the feet and tie with a tag bearing  complete data as to locality, date, sex, etc., with collector's name. To  determine sex of a bird specimen, open the abdomen under thigh. Testes  of male will be found under fore end of pelvis and are white, in young  bird, very small.    Now when the period of drying is past, return to the mounted bird for  finishing touches. With scissors cut the thread feather wrappings. Pull  out pins in back and breast and cut off wing pinning-wires flush under  the plumage. If the specimen was primarily mounted on a rough temporary  perch, remove to the finished permanent stand and color legs and fleshy,  exposed parts of face skin to natural hues with tube oil colors and a  soft brush. Thin the color for this purpose with a little turpentine and  a very little touch of varnish.    In all work in taxidermy, practice develops deftness and a personal  system of handling the details that cannot be brought about except by  sympathetic attention to the art. The work is not difficult when the  details are addressed with quiet thought and very little main strength.    [Illustration]          SKINNING, PREPARING, AND MOUNTING A SMALL MAMMAL          CHAPTER III    SKINNING, PREPARING, AND MOUNTING A SMALL MAMMAL      We will choose a gray squirrel as our subject in this chapter, as this  little rodent has a tough skin that is easily manipulated. A cottontail  rabbit might be more easy to procure, but is not so satisfactory for the  purpose of initiative steps in this work, as his skin is extremely  delicate and requires especially careful handling in preparation and  mounting.    Now, in beginning work upon the small mammal specimen, make outline  studies of it in same way the bird specimen was handled, _i. e._, both  before and after skinning. When the preliminary surface sketches are  completed, replace the wrapping paper used for the purpose, with  newspaper, cornmeal at hand, and proceed with the skinning.    Have scalpel or skinning-knife well sharpened. Lay head of specimen  toward right. Part fur over center of breast bone, insert point of knife  just under skin, forcing backward, and with as near one clean stroke as  possible open the skin neatly along center of abdomen. Do not cut the  abdominal wall. Carry belly incision to close to the vent. In male  specimen run the incision to one side of the testes.    Next insert point of knife in fore center of pad or feet and paws and  with a gentle push carry these incisions upon back of wrists and inside  of ankles to where swell of large muscles is felt. In mammals the size  of woodchuck or raccoon, split toes on under side.    If a mammal skin is to be kept for some time, dried or in brine, split  the tail full length along under side. If tail skin slips easily and the  specimen is to be mounted at once, pull the tail out, splitting only the  very tip to allow arsenic solution to be run through. In many species  the tail must be split and peeled out with a knife because of tough  binding. (For general diagram of incisions, see Fig. 12.)    [Illustration: Fig. 12.]    The next step in handily skinning a mammal is to peel out the feet  through their incisions, severing toes at base and leaving them complete  in the skin. Peel the leg skins back over ankles and wrists (see Fig.  13).    [Illustration: Fig. 13.]    If tail was split, peel it down next, beginning at tip. Now return to  the abdominal incision and neatly peel the skin from the body, in many  instances using only the thumb nail for loosening it.    When the thighs are encountered, bend hind legs back and sever hip  joints from pelvis (see Fig. 13), cutting carefully through the large  muscles so that the skin on opposite side of them may not be punctured.    When the hind legs are cut free, peel around back of pelvis, loosening  skin to base of tail. Set the specimen upon its head end and, with thumb  and finger nails of left hand, grasp skin about the base of tail while  with right hand strip tail out with force.    Next peel the body down to shoulders. Hang large specimen up by cord  tied about loins, the more handily to finish the skinning.    Sever the forelegs at shoulder joint (see Fig. 14), using care not to  cut through skin.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.]    Peel skin down over neck to ears. Cut ears free from head, working with  knife close to skull. Peel to eyes. In cutting the eyelids free, work  close to eyeballs so that lids are not injured. Peel to mouth and cut  close to jaw bones in severing lips and nose from skull (see Fig. 15).    With the skin removed from the body, next peel out the legs.    Split inside of lips free with sharp knife, very carefully, so as not to  break edge of them.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.]    With scissors shear out all mouth and nose meat, being careful not to  cut off the whisker pockets, which are usually very prominent when the  side nose muscles are partly sheared off.    Skin out the backs of the ears clear to edges by pressing a finger tip  inside the ear and peeling over this with finger nail or other dull  instrument. With scissors shear off meat of butt of ear and whatever  meat and fat adheres to rest of skin.    In sketches of skinned body mark points of shoulder joint and hip joint  and note width of pelvis at hip joints.    Remove the skull from the carcass and clean it by cutting and scraping  away all meat, pulling out the eyeballs, and scooping out the brain.  For the purpose of mounting, the base of the skull may be cut off to  facilitate cleaning, but for study (cabinet) skins the skull must be  kept intact and always accompany by number the skin it was removed from.    Trim all meat from the leg bones and poison these and the skull when  finishing preparation of the skin.    Add a few drops of carbolic acid, well stirred in to the arsenic water  used upon skins of small mammals for mounting. This aids in preventing  decay and slipping of the epidermis.    Apply the poison solution thoroughly with a brush, to all inner surfaces  of the skin and to the toes. If tail was split only at the tip, run a  few drops of arsenic water through it.    Turn the poisoned skin right side out, lay it flat, side pressed to  side, roll up, place in paper, and cover with a damp cloth. Lay in this  way over one night, giving the arsenic solution a chance to penetrate  through to roots of hair before mounting. If a specimen is bloody or  mussed the blood may be cleaned off before skinning by wetting the spots  with alcohol and rubbing the blood and juices out with cornmeal.    The first step in mounting is properly to wire the skull and leg bones.  (For details of this see Fig. 16.)    [Illustration: Fig. 16.]    For the body-wire select a size larger than for the legs, cutting it  twice as long as head, neck, and body. For legs choose a size wire that  will firmly support the specimen in position without wobbling. If the  mammal is to sit erect, the hind leg-wires must be considerably larger  than otherwise and foreleg-wires may be much lighter. (Making the pelvis  loop may be easily followed in diagram in Fig. 17.)    [Illustration: Fig. 17.]    The first body-wire loop is bent to set into the brain cavity. Then the  foreleg loop is made some little distance back of actual shoulder point  (in fox-squirrel about an inch and a half or two inches). Get distance  from skull to hip joint from body sketch and follow this sketch for  dimensions in bending wire pelvis into shape. The tail loop is last to  be made.    As Fig. 16 shows, the leg-wires are wrapped tightly upon the back of the  bones with thread or light cord, leaving shorter end of wire passing  from sole of foot. At shoulder joint turn wire back sharply and at hip  ball turn wire in at right angles. In palms and soles of feet turn wire  down at right angles.    When"]]]
