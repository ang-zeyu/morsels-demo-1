The male duck is called drake, the female duck is  termed duck, and the young duck of either sex is termed duckling. In  giving the standard weights for the different breeds of ducks, weights  are given for adult ducks and adult drakes, and for young ducks and  young drakes. By adult duck or drake is meant a bird which is over one  year old. By young duck or drake is meant a bird which is less than one  year old. The horny mouth parts of the duck instead of being termed beak  as in chickens are called bill, and the separate division of the upper  bill at its extremity is termed the bean. Ducks do not show any comb or  wattles as in chickens. In England use is made of the terms ducklet and  drakerel. Ducklet is used to signify a female during her first laying  season just as the word pullet is used in contrast to hen. Drakerel is  used to signify a young drake as contrasted with an older drake just as  the word cockerel is used in comparison to cock in chickens.    _Distinguishing the Sex._ The sex of mature ducks can be readily told by  their voices and also by a difference in the feathering. The duck gives  voice to a coarse, harsh sound which is the characteristic \"quack\"  usually thought of in connection with this class of fowl. The drake on  the other hand utters a cry which is not nearly so loud or harsh but  which is more of a hissing sound. Distinction of sex by this means can  be made after the ducklings are from 4 to 6 weeks old. Before this age,  both sexes make the same peeping noise.    Mature drakes are also distinguished from the ducks by the presence of  two sex feathers at the base of the tail. These are short feathers  which curl or curve upward and forward toward the body of the bird. In  ducks these feathers are absent.      Size    An idea of the size of the different standard breeds can best be  obtained by giving the standard weights. They are as follows:--                  Adult Drake.  Adult Duck.  Young Drake.  Young Duck.  Pekin              9             8            8             7  Aylesbury          9             8            8             7  Rouen              9             8            8             7  Cayuga             8             7            7             6  Muscovy           10             7            8             6  Blue Swedish       8             7            6-1/2         5-1/2  Crested White      7             6            6             5  Buff               8             7            7             6  Runner             4-1/2         4            4             3-1/2    There are no standard weights for the Call duck and for the Black East  India duck but these are all small in size, being really bantam ducks.  The drakes will weigh from 2-1/2 to 3 pounds and the ducks from 2 to 2-1/2  pounds.      Popularity of Breeds    In the meat class by far the most popular duck in this country is the  Pekin. It is the breed which is used exclusively on the large  commercial duck farms. Next to the Pekin in this class probably comes  the Muscovy which is quite commonly kept in some sections of the  country, particularly in the South. The Aylesbury duck has never proved  to be very popular in the United States perhaps due to its white bill  and skin, although it is the popular market duck of England. The other  breeds included in the meat class are kept more or less commonly but do  not approach in popularity either the Pekin or the Muscovy. Any of the  breeds in this class will prove to be satisfactory for a farm flock,  although the Colored breeds and varieties are at a disadvantage when  dressed due to their dark pin feathers.    In the _egg_ class there is included only the Indian Runner and this of  course is the breed which is kept wherever the production of duck eggs  is the primary object. The Fawn and White is the most popular variety of  this breed.    In the ornamental class there is no particular outstanding breed, since  the ducks belonging in this class are kept very largely to satisfy the  pleasure of the owner and the selection of a breed is entirely a matter  of personal preference.      Egg Production    While the conditions under which ducks are kept and the care they are  given will affect their egg production greatly, there are certain  rather definite comparisons that can be made between the different  breeds. The Pekin is a good layer and will produce from 80 to 120 eggs.  The Aylesbury and the Rouen are about alike in laying ability, neither  being quite as good as the Pekin. The Cayuga is a good layer ranking  with the Aylesbury and Rouen or between these and the Pekin. The Muscovy  is an excellent layer being fully as prolific as the Pekin, especially  if broken up when broody and not allowed to sit. The Blue Swedish is  about equal to the Cayuga in laying ability. The Buff duck is an  excellent layer comparing favorably with the Pekin or even with the  Runner. The Runner ducks are the best layers of the duck family and if  given proper care and good feed will compare favorably with hens in egg  producing ability. The Crested White duck is not a particularly good  layer. The Calls and the Black East India ducks will lay from 20 to 60  eggs per year, approaching the latter number if the eggs are collected  as laid and the ducks are not allowed to sit which will induce some of  them to continue to lay for quite a portion of the year. Extremely large  ducks of any breed do not lay as well as the more medium sized birds.    _Size of Duck Eggs._ The eggs of the different meat breeds will run  about the same in size with the exception of the Muscovy whose eggs run  a little larger. Actual weights of eggs from representative flocks show  Pekin, Rouen, Aylesbury and Cayuga eggs to average about 2-1/2 pounds per  dozen although there is a tendency for the Rouen eggs to run somewhat  larger and for Cayugas to run a little smaller. Muscovy eggs weigh about  3 pounds per dozen with selected large eggs weighing as high as 3-1/4  pounds. Eggs of the Runner duck are smaller but are considerably larger  than average hens' eggs or about the size of large Minorca eggs. They  weigh about 2 pounds per dozen. Eggs of the bantam breeds of ducks, the  Calls and the Black East India, together with those of the Mandarin and  Wood ducks will weigh from one pound to 1-1/2 pounds per dozen depending  upon the size of the ducks themselves. Eggs of the Mallard duck will run  from 26 to 32 ounces to the dozen. The size of eggs laid by ducks,  especially the bantam breeds and the Mallard can be increased somewhat  by liberal feeding. Average hens' eggs should weigh about 1-1/2 pounds per  dozen.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.

Lower--Duck eggs--At the left is a Pekin duck egg, next a black  egg laid by a Cayuga duck, third a Muscovy egg, fourth a duck egg of  green color and on the extreme right the egg of a Runner duck.  (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of  Agriculture._)]    _Color of Eggs._ The color of duck eggs ranges from white to a polished  black. Pekin eggs run mostly white although some show a decided blue or  green tint. Aylesbury eggs run quite uniformly white. The color of Rouen  eggs varies from white to a dark green. The Cayuga produces very few  white eggs, most of them being green or black, some being as black as  though polished. Muscovy eggs run from a white to a greenish cream in  color. The eggs of the Blue Swedish and the Buff ducks usually run  white. The Runner duck lays white eggs as a rule while the Crested White  duck lays eggs which range in color from white to green. The eggs of  the Call ducks run from white to green while the eggs of the Black East  India, like the Cayuga, for the most part run from green to black.    A peculiarity in regard to the egg color is that the same female may lay  eggs which are widely different in color. It is likewise true that the  color of the shell is influenced to some extent by the feed. Ducks on  range will lay darker colored eggs than those which are yarded. There is  also a tendency for the eggs to run darker in color when laying first  begins and for the eggs to lighten as laying proceeds. A peculiarity in  regard to duck eggs with a dark colored shell is that a thorough washing  will lighten up the shell color decidedly.    _Broodiness._ The Muscovy, the Call and the Black East India ducks are  broody breeds. The ducks of these breeds will make their nests, hatch  their eggs and are good mothers. All the other breeds are classed as  non-broody breeds. Of course, a certain percentage of them will go  broody and show a desire to sit but they do not make reliable sitters  and mothers and are not as a rule used for this purpose.      Considerations in Making the Mating[1]    Since ducks are kept for different purposes there will of course be  certain fundamental differences in the different classes in the  selection of the individuals to make up the mating. Whatever the  purpose, however, the first consideration in selecting the breeders must  be to secure those which possess excellent vigor and general health and  which meet insofar as possible the standard requirements for size. Where  the Call duck and the Black East India are concerned the selection for  size must be for smallness since that is a characteristic greatly  desired. In the other breeds the selection for size must be to see that  they come up to the standard weights for the particular breed in  question. As in other classes of fowls the condition and cleanliness of  the plumage and the general appearance and actions of the birds are good  indications of their health and thriftiness.

Rainfall records from the Cocoa  Research Station from April, 1959, to December, 1964, were available to  me. These data, along with the average for each month, are given in  Table 3. There appears to be little correlation between rainfall and  breeding season at Quoin Hill. A true dry season in the Quoin Hill area  does not occur, but monthly rainfall has varied from 0.57 inches to  21.27 inches in a single year.

W. Ryves. Gibson-Hill has shown that the  data collected by Ryves covered two widely separated localities, one at  Kiau near Kota Belud and the other near Sandakan. The former locality is  on the west coast of North Borneo and the latter on the east coast of  North Borneo. Gibson-Hill points out, and rightly so, that the timing of  the rainfall in different parts of Borneo must be taken into account  because of the large regional variation. The nesting data from the Ryves  egg collection are scant and when used alone possibly yield a distorted  view of the actual breeding season. Ryves did no collecting in the  Sandakan area between September and March, and in the Kiau area between  May and January. Although the breeding data from North Borneo  accumulated by both Ryves and myself are limited, and records of  rainfall are scant, there appears to be a trend toward breeding after  the heavy rains have fallen.    _Seasonality of breeding in tropical birds._--Possibly Bornean birds  breed mostly in the \"driest\" part of the year. If so, this is in  contrast with the time of breeding of birds of other tropical areas.  Moreau (1950) found that in the Congo there was no distinct breeding  season for most groups of birds, but that in East Africa there was a  double breeding season; the peaks coincided with the two rainy seasons.  Lack (1950) found that the Geospizinae of the Galapagos breed only when  it rains and that rainfall causes a flurry of nest building and singing.  If the rains stop, then the courtship activities stop until the next  rains. Miller (1963) found that in birds of a western Andean cloud  forest the breeding season was spread over the year and that breeding  could not be correlated with rainfall.    Obviously more study is required on breeding of birds in Borneo before  the timing of the annual cycle can be ascertained.          ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES      The English names used in this report follow Smythies (1960) where  possible. If the bird has not been recorded from Borneo previously, then  I have resorted to Delacours and Mayr's \"Birds of the Philippines\"  (1946). The taxonomy is that of Smythies (1960), except where current  American or my own opinion differs and where new evidence has warranted  a change. The sequence of families is that of Wetmore (1960).    Two species listed beyond that had not previously been recorded from the  island of Borneo are: Red-footed Booby, _Sula sula_; and Whitehead's  Thick-head, _Pachycephala whiteheadi_. Six additional kinds listed  beyond had not previously been recorded from North Borneo. They are:  Chinese Egret, _Egretta eulophotes_; Knot, _Calidris canutus_; Ground  Cuckoo, _Carpococcyx radiceus_; _Stachyris nigriceps hartleyi_; Finch's  Bulbul, _Criniger finschii_; and Pale Blue Flycatcher, _Muscicapa  unicolor_.    _=Sula sula=_ (Linnaeus): Red-footed Booby.--A captive seen in the Tawau  police station was said to have been caught when it landed at night on a  police launch anchored off Siamil Island in or near May, 1962. The bird  was in first-year or second-year plumage, seemed to be tame, and was  thriving on a diet of fish. Identification was made by Alexander Wetmore  from a photographic print. This is the first seemingly substantiated  record of the species from Borneo, although it probably occurs there  regularly. The species breeds on Bankoran Island and on Tubbataha Reef  in the Sulu Sea (Smythies, 1960:113).    _=Fregata ariel=_ (G. R. Gray): Lesser Frigatebird.--This conspicuous  bird on the waters around Tawau is occasionally seen in Cowie Harbor but  more often along the coast outside the Harbor. On September 20 an  estimated 300-500 birds circled over the shore northeast of Tawau.    _=Ardea sumatrana sumatrana=_ Raffles: Dusky-gray Heron.--_Specimens_,  2.
