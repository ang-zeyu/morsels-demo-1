I like those boys. They often see me up in the  woods an' ask me to help them track a hoss or help kill some fresh  meat.\"    \"They're workin' for Beasley now.\"    \"Is that so?\" rejoined Dale, with a sudden start. \"An' what doin'?\"    \"Beasley is gettin' so rich he's buildin' a fence, an' didn't have  enough help, so I hear.\"    \"Beasley gettin' rich!\" repeated Dale, thoughtfully. \"More sheep an'  horses an' cattle than ever, I reckon?\"    \"Laws-a'-me! Why, Milt, Beasley 'ain't any idea what he owns. Yes, he's  the biggest man in these parts, since poor old Al's took to failin'. I  reckon Al's health ain't none improved by Beasley's success. They've bad  some bitter quarrels lately--so I hear. Al ain't what he was.\"    Dale bade good-by again to his old friend and strode away, thoughtful  and serious. Beasley would not only be difficult to circumvent, but he  would be dangerous to oppose. There did not appear much doubt of his  driving his way rough-shod to the dominance of affairs there in Pine.  Dale, passing down the road, began to meet acquaintances who had  hearty welcome for his presence and interest in his doings, so that his  pondering was interrupted for the time being. He carried the turkey to  another old friend, and when he left her house he went on to the village  store. This was a large log cabin, roughly covered with clapboards, with  a wide plank platform in front and a hitching-rail in the road. Several  horses were standing there, and a group of lazy, shirt-sleeved loungers.    \"I'll be doggoned if it ain't Milt Dale!\" exclaimed one.    \"Howdy, Milt, old buckskin! Right down glad to see you,\" greeted  another.    \"Hello, Dale! You air shore good for sore eyes,\" drawled still another.    After a long period of absence Dale always experienced a singular warmth  of feeling when he met these acquaintances. It faded quickly when he got  back to the intimacy of his woodland, and that was because the people of  Pine, with few exceptions--though they liked him and greatly admired his  outdoor wisdom--regarded him as a sort of nonentity. Because he loved  the wild and preferred it to village and range life, they had classed  him as not one of them. Some believed him lazy; others believed him  shiftless; others thought him an Indian in mind and habits; and there  were many who called him slow-witted. Then there was another side to  their regard for him, which always afforded him good-natured amusement.  Two of this group asked him to bring in some turkey or venison; another  wanted to hunt with him. Lem Harden came out of the store and appealed  to Dale to recover his stolen horse. Lem's brother wanted a wild-running  mare tracked and brought home. Jesse Lyons wanted a colt broken, and  broken with patience, not violence, as was the method of the hard-riding  boys at Pine. So one and all they besieged Dale with their selfish  needs, all unconscious of the flattering nature of these overtures. And  on the moment there happened by two women whose remarks, as they entered  the store, bore strong testimony to Dale's personality.    \"If there ain't Milt Dale!\" exclaimed the older of the two. \"How lucky!  My cow's sick, an' the men are no good doctorin'. I'll jest ask Milt  over.\"    \"No one like Milt!\" responded the other woman, heartily.    \"Good day there--you Milt Dale!\" called the first speaker. \"When you git  away from these lazy men come over.\"    Dale never refused a service, and that was why his infrequent visits to  Pine were wont to be prolonged beyond his own pleasure.    Presently Beasley strode down the street, and when about to enter the  store he espied Dale.    \"Hullo there, Milt!\" he called, cordially, as he came forward with  extended hand. His greeting was sincere, but the lightning glance he  shot over Dale was not born of his pleasure. Seen in daylight, Beasley  was a big, bold, bluff man, with strong, dark features. His aggressive  presence suggested that he was a good friend and a bad enemy.    Dale shook hands with him.    \"How are you, Beasley?\"    \"Ain't complainin', Milt, though I got more work than I can rustle.  Reckon you wouldn't take a job bossin' my sheep-herders?\"    \"Reckon I wouldn't,\" replied Dale. \"Thanks all the same.\"    \"What's goin' on up in the woods?\"    \"Plenty of turkey an' deer. Lots of bear, too. The Indians have worked  back on the south side early this fall. But I reckon winter will come  late an' be mild.\"    \"Good! An' where 're you headin' from?\"    \"'Cross-country from my camp,\" replied Dale, rather evasively.    \"Your camp! Nobody ever found that yet,\" declared Beasley, gruffly.    \"It's up there,\" said Dale.    \"Reckon you've got that cougar chained in your cabin door?\" queried  Beasley, and there was a barely distinguishable shudder of his muscular  frame. Also the pupils dilated in his hard brown eyes.    \"Tom ain't chained. An' I haven't no cabin, Beasley.\"    \"You mean to tell me that big brute stays in your camp without bein'  hog-tied or corralled!\" demanded Beasley.    \"Sure he does.\"    \"Beats me! But, then, I'm queer on cougars. Have had many a cougar trail  me at night. Ain't sayin' I was scared. But I don't care for that brand  of varmint.... Milt, you goin' to stay down awhile?\"    \"Yes, I'll hang around some.\"    \"Come over to the ranch. Glad to see you any time. Some old huntin'  pards of yours are workin' for me.\"    \"Thanks, Beasley. I reckon I'll come over.\"    Beasley turned away and took a step, and then, as if with an  after-thought, he wheeled again.    \"Suppose you've heard about old Al Auchincloss bein' near petered out?\"  queried Beasley. A strong, ponderous cast of thought seemed to emanate  from his features. Dale divined that Beasley's next step would be to  further his advancement by some word or hint.    \"Widow Cass was tellin' me all the news. Too bad about old Al,\" replied  Dale.    \"Sure is. He's done for. An' I'm sorry--though Al's never been square--\"    \"Beasley,\" interrupted Dale, quickly, \"you can't say that to me. Al  Auchincloss always was the whitest an' squarest man in this sheep  country.\"    Beasley gave Dale a fleeting, dark glance.    \"Dale, what you think ain't goin' to influence feelin' on this range,\"  returned Beasley, deliberately. \"You live in the woods an'--\"    \"Reckon livin' in the woods I might think--an' know a whole lot,\"  interposed Dale, just as deliberately. The group of men exchanged  surprised glances. This was Milt Dale in different aspect. And Beasley  did not conceal a puzzled surprise.    \"About what--now?\" he asked, bluntly.    \"Why, about what's goin' on in Pine,\" replied Dale.    Some of the men laughed.    \"Shore lots goin' on--an' no mistake,\" put in Lem Harden.    Probably the keen Beasley had never before considered Milt Dale as a  responsible person; certainly never one in any way to cross his trail.  But on the instant, perhaps, some instinct was born, or he divined an  antagonism in Dale that was both surprising and perplexing.    \"Dale, I've differences with Al Auchincloss--have had them for years,\"  said Beasley. \"Much of what he owns is mine. An' it's goin' to come to  me. Now I reckon people will be takin' sides--some for me an' some for  Al. Most are for me.... Where do you stand? Al Auchincloss never had no  use for you, an' besides he's a dyin' man. Are you goin' on his side?\"    \"Yes, I reckon I am.\"    \"Wal, I'm glad you've declared yourself,\" rejoined Beasley, shortly,  and he strode away with the ponderous gait of a man who would brush any  obstacle from his path.    \"Milt, thet's bad--makin' Beasley sore at you,\" said Lem Harden. \"He's  on the way to boss this outfit.\"    \"He's sure goin' to step into Al's boots,\" said another.    \"Thet was white of Milt to stick up fer poor old Al,\" declared Lem's  brother.    Dale broke away from them and wended a thoughtful way down the road. The  burden of what he knew about Beasley weighed less heavily upon him, and  the close-lipped course he had decided upon appeared wisest. He needed  to think before undertaking to call upon old Al Auchincloss; and to that  end he sought an hour's seclusion under the pines.        CHAPTER III    In the afternoon, Dale, having accomplished some tasks imposed upon him  by his old friends at Pine, directed slow steps toward the Auchincloss  ranch.    The flat, square stone and log cabin of unusually large size stood upon  a little hill half a mile out of the village. A home as well as a fort,  it had been the first structure erected in that region, and the process  of building had more than once been interrupted by Indian attacks.  The Apaches had for some time, however, confined their fierce raids to  points south of the White Mountain range. Auchincloss's house looked  down upon barns and sheds and corrals of all sizes and shapes, and  hundreds of acres of well-cultivated soil. Fields of oats waved gray and  yellow in the afternoon sun; an immense green pasture was divided by a  willow-bordered brook, and here were droves of horses, and out on the  rolling bare flats were straggling herds of cattle.    The whole ranch showed many years of toil and the perseverance of  man. The brook irrigated the verdant valley between the ranch and the  village. Water for the house, however, came down from the high, wooded  slope of the mountain, and had been brought there by a simple expedient.  Pine logs of uniform size had been laid end to end, with a deep trough  cut in them, and they made a shining line down the slope, across the  valley, and up the little hill to the Auchincloss home. Near the house  the hollowed halves of logs had been bound together, making a crude  pipe. Water ran uphill in this case, one of the facts that made the  ranch famous, as it had always been a wonder and delight to the small  boys"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34571"],[0,"The Pearl Story Book: Stories and Legends of Winter, Christmas, and New Year's (#4)"],[1,"wife, Marie.  They were very sad because they had no children. One cold winter day  the peasant and his wife sat near a window in their cottage and  watched the village children playing in the snow. The little ones were  busily at work making a beautiful snow maiden.    Ivan turned to his wife and said, \"What a good time the children are  having. See, they are making a beautiful snow maiden. Come, let us go  into the garden and amuse ourselves in the same way. We will make a  pretty little snow image.\"    They went into the garden which lay back of their cottage.    \"My husband,\" said Marie, \"we have no children, what do you say to  our making for ourselves a child of snow?\"    \"A very good idea!\" said the husband. And he at once began to mold the  form of a little body, with tiny feet and hands. His wife made a small  head and set it upon the shoulders of the snow image.    A man who passed by the garden stopped for a moment and looked at the  peasants who were so strangely occupied. After a moment's silence he  said to them, \"May God help you.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Ivan.    \"God's blessing, indeed, is always good,\" nodded Marie.    \"What are you making?\" asked the stranger.    Ivan looked up and said, \"We are making a little snow maiden.\" Then he  went on with his work, forming the nose, chin, and eyes.    In a few moments the snow child was finished, and Ivan looked at her  in great admiration. Suddenly, he noticed that the mouth and eyes  opened, the cheeks and lips took on a rosy hue, and in a few moments  the astonished peasant saw standing before him a living child.    \"Who are you?\" he asked, filled with wonder at seeing a little girl  instead of a snow image.    \"I am Snow White, your little daughter,\" said the child. Then she  threw her arms lovingly around the man and his wife, who both began to  cry for joy.    The delighted parents took Snow White into the cottage, and before  long the news ran through the village that a little daughter had come  to live with Ivan and Marie.    Of course the village children came to play with Snow White. She was  such a charming little girl, with a very white skin, eyes as blue as  the sky, and lovely golden hair. To be sure, her cheeks were not so  rosy as those of her companions, but she was so bright and gentle that  everyone loved her very much indeed.    The winter passed very quickly and Snow White grew so fast that by the  time the trees were veiled in the green buds of spring she was as tall  as a girl of twelve or thirteen years.    During the winter months the snow maiden had been very joyous and  happy, but when the mild, warm days of spring came she seemed sad and  low-spirited. Her mother, Marie, noticed the change and said to her,  \"My dear little girl, why are you sad? Tell me, are you ill?\"    \"No, mother, dear, I am not ill,\" said Snow White. But she no longer  seemed to enjoy playing out of doors with the other children; she  stayed very quietly in the cottage.    One lovely spring day the village children came to the cottage and  called out, \"Come, Snow White! Come! We are going into the woods to  gather wild flowers. Come with us.\"    \"Yes, do go, my dear!\" said mother Marie. \"Go with your little friends  and gather spring flowers. I'm sure you'll enjoy the outing.\"    Away went the happy children to the woods. They gathered the lovely  wild flowers and made them into bouquets and coronets, and when the  afternoon sun began to sink in the western sky they built a big  bonfire. Gayly they sang little songs, merrily dancing around the  bright, crackling blaze.    \"Let each one dance alone,\" called out one of the little girls.    \"Snow White, watch us for a little while, and then you, too, will  know how to dance alone.\"    Away whirled the happy little children, dancing freely round and round  the bonfire. In a little while Snow White joined them.    When the gay little people were out of breath and the dancing grew  slower and slower, some one called out, \"Where is Snow White?\"    \"Snow White, where are you?\" shouted the other children, but nowhere  could they find their little companion.    They ran home and told Ivan and Marie that Snow White had disappeared  while dancing round the bonfire. The villagers made a thorough search  for the little maiden, but they never found her, for while she was  dancing around the bonfire she had slowly changed into a little white  vapour and had flown away toward the sky, where she changed into a  delicate snowflake.          THE FROST KING          Oho! have you seen the Frost King,          A-marching up the hill?      His hoary face is stern and pale,          His touch is icy chill.      He sends the birdlings to the South,          He bids the brooks be still;      Yet not in wrath or cruelty          He marches up the hill.        He will often rest at noontime,          To see the sunbeams play;      And flash his spears of icicles,          Or let them melt away.      He'll toss the snowflakes in the air,          Nor let them go nor stay;      Then hold his breath while swift they fall,          That coasting boys may play.        He'll touch the brooks and rivers wide,          That skating crowds may shout;      He'll make the people far and near          Remember he's about.      He'll send his nimble, frosty Jack--          Without a shade of doubt--      To do all kinds of merry pranks,          And call the children out;        He'll sit upon the whitened fields,          And reach his icy hand      O'er houses where the sudden cold          Folks cannot understand.      The very moon, that ventures forth          From clouds so soft and grand,      Will stare to see the stiffened look          That settles o'er the land.        And so the Frost King o'er the hills,          And o'er the startled plain,      Will come and go from year to year          Till Earth grows young again--      Till Time himself shall cease to be,          Till gone are hill and plain:      Whenever Winter comes to stay,          The hoary King shall reign.                            Mary Mapes Dodge.          KING WINTER'S HARVEST      King Winter sat upon his iceberg throne, and waving his scepter, a  huge icicle, called for all the Snow Fairies and Frost Fairies to draw  near, as he wished to see them.    \"Tell me, Snow Fairies,\" said King Winter, \"what have you been doing  of late; have you made anybody happy by your work?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" they all said at once, \"we had the jolliest time last night  putting white dresses on the trees, white spreads over the grasses,  white caps on all the fence posts, and making things look so strange  that when the children came out in the morning they just shouted and  laughed, and soon threw so much snow over each other that they were  dressed in white, too, and seemed Snow Fairies like ourselves. They,  too, wanted to make curious canes, castles, and other things with the  snow as we had done. Sleds were brought out and when the sleighbells  commenced their music it seemed that everybody was made glad by our  work.\"    \"Well done,\" said King Winter, \"now away to your work again.\"    In a twinkling the Snow Fairies were up in a purple cloud-boat  throwing a shower of snowflake kisses down to King Winter to thank him  for giving them work to do.    \"Now, Frost Fairies,\" said King Winter, turning to a glittering band  who wore some of his own jewels, \"what have you done to make anybody  glad?\"    \"We have made pictures upon the windows and hung your jewels upon the  trees for the people to look at, and covered the skating ponds,\" said  Jack Frost, the leader.    \"That is good,\" said King Winter. \"You and the Snow Fairies seem to be  making the world glad now, but pretty soon we must leave the work, and  the good sunbeams will put our things away; they will hide the  snowballs, and crack the skating ponds so that the ice may float  downstream. Now I would like to make something that will keep long  after we are gone away. Queen Summer is gone but her harvest of hay  and grain is in the barns. Queen Autumn is gone but her harvest of  apples and potatoes is in the cellars; now I want to leave a harvest,  too.\"    \"But the sunbeams are away most of the time now,\" said Jack Frost.  \"Can anything grow without them?\"    \"My harvest will grow best without them,\" said King Winter, \"and I'll  just hang up a thick cloud curtain and ask them to play upon the other  side while my harvest grows. Mr. North Wind will help, and if all you  Frost Fairies do your liveliest work my harvest will soon be ready.\"    North Wind soon came with bags of cold air which he scattered hither  and thither, while the Frost Fairies carried it into every track and  corner, wondering all the while what the harvest would be. But after  two days' work they found out; for horses were hitched to sleds and  men started for the lakes and rivers, saying, \"The ice has frozen so  thick that it is a fine time to fill the ice-houses.\" Saws and poles  were carried along, and soon huge blocks of ice were finding places  upon the sleds ready for a ride to some ice-house where they would be  packed so securely in sawdust that King Winter's harvest would keep  through the very hottest weather.    \"Then the ice-men can play that they are we,\" said a Frost Fairy,  \"scattering cold all about to make people glad.\"          OLD KING WINTER          Old King Winter's on his throne        In robes of ermine white;      The crown of jewels on his head        Now glitters bright with light.        The little flakes of snow and hail,        And tiny pearls of sleet,      Are with the wild winds dancing        All round his magic feet.        His beard is white, his cheeks are red,        His heart is filled with cheer;      His season's best some people say;        The _best_ of all the year.                            Anna E.
