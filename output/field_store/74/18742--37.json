It was proved that  the condemned men received from Germany wireless messages, to be  forwarded to North and South America for the purposes of its underseas  campaign, and incriminating letters of their treasonable acts were  discovered. Ampt and his three co-Directors received a decoration from  the Imperial Government, but were so successful in deceiving the Italian  Government that they were subsequently decorated as Cavalieres of the  Crown of Italy.      AMERICAN TRADE PACT WITH NORWAY.    The signing of a general commercial agreement between the United States  and Norway--the first agreement of the kind to be entered into by  America with one of the North European neutrals--was announced by the  War Trade Board on May 3, 1918. It was signed by Vance McCormick,  Chairman of the War Trade Board, and Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, the famous  explorer, who was sent to the United States at the head of a special  mission.    Under the agreement Norway is assured of supplies to cover her estimated  needs so far as they can be furnished without detriment to the war needs  of the United States and its allies, and Norway, on her part, agrees to  permit the exportation to America and its allies of all Norwegian  products not needed for home consumption. It is provided that none of  the supplies imported from the United States or its allies or forwarded  with the aid of American bunker coal shall go directly or indirectly to  the Central Powers or be used to replace commodities exported to those  countries. This applies to anything produced by any auxiliaries to  production obtained under the agreement. In consequence of the agreement  the War Trade Board announced on May 9 that exports to Norway were about  to be resumed.    Another result of the improved relations between the two countries was  the chartering by the United States Shipping Board of 400,000 tons of  Norwegian sailing ships, to be put in non-hazardous trades, thereby  releasing other ships for traffic in the danger zones. This was one of  the most substantial increases which the American-controlled merchant  fleet has received since its inception.

GREAT BRITAIN'S WAR EXPENSES    The British Government has issued a White Paper estimating the cost of  the war for Great Britain in the year ending March 31, 1919, at  $12,750,000,000, of which $9,305,000,000 is allocated to navy, army, air  service, munition and ordnance factories, $205,000,000 to pensions,  $750,000 to National War Aims Committee; services not specified,  (presumed to include shipping,) $500,000,000; Treasury loans,  $1,750,000,000; Board of Trade, $265,000,000; wheat supplies,  $230,000,000, of which $200,000,000 is the estimated loss on the sale of  the 18-cent loaf of bread. Subsidies toward the sale of potatoes are  estimated at $25,000,000; purchases of wool and other raw materials are  put at $40,000,000, payment to railways at $175,000,000, and $25,000,000  for timber.      HATRED BETWEEN ITALIANS AND AUSTRIANS    THE implacable hatred which has developed between Italians and Austrians  is illustrated by the following Italian _communique_, issued in Rome on  Feb. 11, in reply to the Austrian Supreme Command's denial that the  Austro-Germans were first to bombard cities from airplanes. It points  out that the Austro-Germans first bombarded Udine, Treviso, Padua,  Verona, Venice, Ravenna, &c., massacring defenseless and innocent  populations and ruining valuable art treasures, and adds:        The Italians went to Trieste not to bombard citizens and private      houses, but the hydroplane stations in which are sheltered the      assassins of Venice, and the two vessels of the Monarch type which      were kept by the Imperial and Royal Navy behind the dyke, in the      hope that the Italian elements of the city would help to protect      them and afterward enable them to set out on some heroic enterprise      against the defenseless localities on the Adriatic Coast.      Immediately the hydroplanes, yielding to the indignation of the      whole world, ceased bombarding Venice, and immediately the two      vessels of the Monarch type were removed from Trieste, our aerial      raids ceased, since an understanding was proposed.        We wage war against the enemy's armed forces, and not against women,      children, monuments, and hospitals. In spite of the most solemn      denial issued by the Austrians of the acts which, after the first      bombardments of Padua, Treviso, and Vicenza at the end of December      and the beginning of January, they declared to be a question of      reprisals for bombardments, carried out by Franco-British aviators      on        German towns, the Germans, in substance, gave to be understood what      the Austrians hypocritically wished to hide, that is, that the      pretext of reprisals enabled them to persevere with their nameless      atrocities, which had been imposed upon them by some of their      leaders having yielded to the impulses of a criminal mentality. Thus      it happened that the Austrian Catholic command, bowing to the orders      of the German Lutheran pastors, bombarded Catholic churches in the      Italian cities. And so we see the Austro-Hungarian Government--so      solicitous for peace and love between nations--sowing hatred which      nothing can quench.      THE ORIGIN OF THE IRISH    Perhaps some light may be shed on the internal divisions which make the  solution of the Irish question so nearly impossible by a realization of  the fact that the population of Ireland consists of an unassimilated  congeries of races, every element of which except one represents foreign  invasion and conquest.    The earliest race, short, round-headed, dark, appears to be akin to the  Ligurian race of the Mediterranean; this race hunted the huge Irish elks  with flint arrows and axes, and may claim to be the real indigenous  stock, still surviving in the west. The second race, tall, dark,  long-headed, was akin to the Iberians (Basques) of Spain, who also  invaded Western France, and who probably built the cromlechs and stone  circles, since these are also found in Iberian Spain and Western France,  as at Carnac in Brittany. The third race, tall, golden-haired,  blue-eyed, came from the Baltic, bringing amber beads, and building  chambered pyramids, such as are also found in Denmark. The fourth race  to arrive included the Gaels, tall, round-headed, with red hair and gray  eyes; they came from Central Europe, probably by way of France.    Each new arrival was followed by wars of conquest, the Gaels finally  making themselves predominant, but not exterminating the older  races, examples of whom may still be found, with unchanged race  characteristics. In 1169 Norman French and Welsh came, as mercenaries in  the army of the King of Leinster. The Burkes are descended from the  Normans, the Fitzgeralds from the Welsh.          Battles in Picardy and Flanders      Military Review of All Fronts from April 17 to May 18, 1918.      In order to obtain a view of the situation of the German offensive on  April 17, which forms a background for the events to be related in this  review, it is necessary to point out a few controlling facts and  conditions--some long obvious, some recently revealed.    Ludendorff's major plan,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41481"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science January 1930 (#4)"],[1," a hundred yards away from him, very close to the fallen  plane, and she must have emerged from a large hole in the ground which  Tommy could now see under a ledge of overhanging rock.    She seemed to be dressed in a single garment which fell to her knees,  and appeared to fit tightly about her body, but as she came nearer,  Tommy, watching her, petrified by this latest apparition, discovered  that it was woven of her own hair, which must have been of immense  length, for it fell naturally to her shoulders, and thence was woven  into this close-fitting material, a fringe an inch or two in length  extending beneath the selvage.    She was about six feet tall, and apparently made after the normal human  pattern. She moved with a slow, majestic swing, and if ever any female  had seemed to Tommy to have the appearance of an angel, this unknown  woman did.    She was so fair, in that flossy, flaxen covering, she moved with such  easy grace, that Tommy, gaping, gradually crept nearer to her. She did  not seem to see him. She was stooping over the very sand heap into which  he had fallen. Suddenly, with lightning-like rapidity, her arms shot  out, her hands began tunneling in the sand. With a cry of triumph she  pulled out the shrimp Tommy had seen, or another like it, and, stripping  it off the shell, began devouring it with evident relish.    In the midst of her meal the girl raised her head and looked at Tommy.  He saw that her eyes were filmed, vacant, dead. Then of a sudden a third  membrane was drawn back across the pupils, and she saw him.    She let the shrimp drop to the ground, uttered a cry, and moved toward  him with a tottering gait. She groped toward him with outstretched arms.  And then she was blind again, for the membrane once more covered her  pupils. It was as if her eyes were unable to endure even the dim light  of the valley, through whose surrounding mists the low sun, setting just  above the horizon, was unable to diffuse itself save as a brightening of  the fog curtain.           *       *       *       *       *    Tommy stepped toward the girl. His outstretched hand touched hers. It  was unquestionably a woman's hand he held, delicately warm, with  exquisitely moulded fingers, in whose touch there seemed to be, for the  girl, some tactile impression of him.    Again that membrane was drawn back from the girl's pupils for a fleeting  flash. Tommy saw two eyes of intense black, their color contrasting  curiously with the flaxen color of her hair and her white skin, almost  the tint of an albino's. Those eyes had surveyed him, and appeared  satisfied that he was one of her kind. She could not have seen very much  in that almost instantaneous flash of vision. Queer, that membrane--as  if she had been used to living in the dark, as if the full light of the  day was unbearable!    She drew her hand away. Soft vocals came from her lips. Suddenly she  turned swiftly. She could not have seen, but before Tommy had seen, she  had sensed the presence of the old man who was creeping out of the hole  in the mountainside.    He moved forward craftily, and then pounced upon the sand pile, and in a  moment had pulled out another of the big shrimps, which he proceeded to  devour with greedy relish. The girl, leaving Tommy's side, joined him in  that unpleasant feast.    And in the midst of it a flood came pouring from the hole--a flood of  living beetles, covering the ground in fifteen-foot leaps as they dashed  at the two.    To his horror, Tommy saw Jimmy Dodd among them, wrapped in his fur coat  like a mummy, and being pushed and rolled forward like a football.    For a moment Tommy hesitated, torn between his solicitude for Jim Dodd  and that for the girl. Then, as the foremost of the monsters bounded to  her side, he ran between them. The vicious jaws snapped within six  inches of Tommy's face, with a force that would have carried away an  ear, or shredded the cheek, if they had met.           *       *       *       *       *    Tommy struck out with all his might, and his fist clanged on the  resounding shell so that the blood spurted from his bruised knuckles. He  had struck the monster squarely upon the thorax, and he had not  discommoded it in the least. It turned on him, its glassy, many-faceted  eyes glaring with a cold, infernal light. Tommy struck out again with  his left hand, this time upon the pulpy flesh of the downward-opening  mouth.    An inch higher, and he would have impaled his hand upon the beak, with a  point like a needle, and evidently used for purposes of attack, since it  was not connected with the mandibles. The blow appeared to fall in the  only vulnerable place. The monster dropped upon its back and lay there,  unable to reverse itself, its antenna and forelegs waving in the air,  and the rear legs rasping together in a shrill, strident shriek.    Instantly, as Tommy darted out of the way, the swarm fell upon the  helpless monster and began devouring it, tearing strips of flesh from  the lower shell, which in the space of a half-minute was reduced simply  to bone. The most horrible feature of this act of cannibalism was the  complete silence with which it was performed, except for the rasping of  the dying monster's legs. It was evident that the huge beetles had no  vocal apparatus.    For the moment left unguarded, Jim Dodd flung down the collar of his fur  coat, stared about him, and recognized Tommy.    \"My God, it's you!\" he yelled. \"Well, can you--?\"    He had no time to finish his sentence. A pair of antenna went round his  neck from behind. At the same instant Tommy, the old man, and the girl  were gripped by the monsters, which, forming a solid phalanx about them,  began hustling them in the direction of the hole. Resistance was utterly  impossible. Tommy felt as if he was being pushed along by a moving wall  of stone.    Inside the opening it was completely dark. Tommy shouted to Dodd, but  the strident sounds of the moving legs drowned his cries. He was being  pushed forward into the unknown.           *       *       *       *       *    Suddenly the ground seemed to fall away beneath his feet. He struggled,  cried out, and felt himself descending through the air.    For a full half-minute he went downward at a speed that constricted his  throat so that he could hardly draw breath. Then, just as he had nerved  himself for the imminent crash, the speed of his descent was checked. In  another moment he found that he was slowing to a standstill in mid-air.    He was beginning to float backward--upward. But the wall of moving  shells, pushing against him, forced him on, downward, and yet apparently  against the force of gravitation.    Then of a sudden Tommy was aware of a dim light all about him. His feet  touched earth and grass as softly as a thistledown alighting.    He found himself seated in the same dim light upon red grass, and  staring into Jimmy's face.          CHAPTER III    _Ten Miles Underground_      \"What I was going to say when we were interrupted, was, 'Can you beat  it?'\" Jimmy Dodd observed, with admirable sang-froid.    They were still seated on the red grass, gazing about them at what  looked like an illimitable plain, and upward into depths of darkness. It  was warm, and the light, furnished by what appeared to be luminous  vegetation, was about that of twilight.    On every side were clumps of trees and shrubs, which formed centers of  phosphorescent illumination, but for the most part the land was open,  and here and there human figures appeared, moving with head down and  arms hanging earthward.    \"No, I'm damned if I can,\" said Tommy. \"What happened to you after we  crashed?\"    \"Why, first thing I knew, I found myself riding on the back of a fossil  beetle, apparently one of the _curculionidae_,\" said Dodd.    \"Never, mind being so precise, Jimmy. Let's call it a beetle. Go on.\"    \"They set me down inside the hole and seemed to be investigating me,  the whole swarm of them. Of course, I thought I was dead, and come to  my just reward, especially when I saw those beaks. Then one of them  began tickling my face with its antenna, and I drew up my fur collar.  They didn't seem to like the feel of the fur, and after a while the  whole gang started hustling me back again, like a nest of ants carrying  something they don't want outside their hill. And then you bobbed up.\"    \"Well, my opinion is you saved your life by pulling up your collar,\"  said Tommy. \"Looks to me as if it's a case of the survival of the  fittest, said fittest being the insect, and the human race taking second  place. You know what the humans here live on, don't you?\"    \"No, what?\"    \"Shrimps as big as poodles. If you'd seen that girl and the old man  getting outside them, you'd realize that there seems to be a food  shortage in this part of the world. Say, where in thunder are we,  Jimmy?\"    \"Haven't you guessed yet, Travers?\" asked Dodd, a spice of malice in his  voice.    \"I suppose this is some sort of big hole on the site of the south pole,  with warm vapors coming up. Maybe a great fissure in the earth, or  something.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Jimmy Dodd's grin, seen in the half-light, was rather disconcerting.  \"How far do you think we dropped just now?\" Dodd asked.    \"Why, I'd say several hundred yards,\" replied Tommy. \"What's your  estimate?\"    \"Just about ten miles,\" answered Dodd.    \"What? You're still crazy! Why, we slowed up!\"    \"Yeah,\" grinned Dodd, \"we slowed up. We're inside the crust of the  world. That's the long and short of it. The earth we've known is just a  shell over our heads.\"    \"Yeah? Walking head downward, are we? Then why don't we drop to the  center of the earth, you damn fool?\"    \"Because, my dear fellow, you can swing a pailful of water round your  head without spilling any of it. In other words, our old friend,  centrifugal force. The speed with which the earth is rotating, keeps us  on our feet, head downward. "]]]
