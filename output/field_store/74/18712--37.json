A   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38478"],[0,"Narrative of the Circumnavigation of the Globe (#4)"],[1,"the original language of the aborigines.    Since the appearance of the first ethnographic works of Count Strzelecki  there has appeared little that is new respecting the origin, migration,  and history of the black races of Australia, and what we have to say on  this momentous topic, whether in the result of personal intercourse or of  information derived from other sources, we shall reserve for the narrative  of our excursion into the interior of the colony, and our foregathering  with the primitive inhabitants of the back settlements.[13]    Among the excursions in the immediate neighbourhood of Sydney we at once  selected a visit to the well-known naturalist Mr. Macleay, who resides at  a beautiful estate near Elizabeth Bay. In his beautiful garden one sees  the most interesting plants of Australia side by side with splendid  specimens from all other parts of the world. A stroll through the  extensive grounds derives a double interest when in company with its  highly-cultivated proprietor, and we are the more grateful for this good  fortune, as the venerable old gentleman lives in strict seclusion.    Another very interesting visit was that paid to Sir Daniel Cooper at his  residence on Rose Bay (_Wullurah_).[14] Sir Daniel is of humble parentage,  but fell heir to property which made him the wealthiest man in the colony,  and which he now dispenses with the most noble and hospitable profusion.  During the Crimean war he subscribed L1000 per annum towards defraying the  costs. Lately he has been elected speaker of the Legislative Assembly,  when he was knighted by her Majesty. His villa in Rose Bay, when  completed, promised to be surpassed by few mansions of the English  nobility in elegance and comfort.    Close to the palatial residence of the wealthiest resident of Australia,  and clad in a filthy woollen coat, with an old hat on his head, crouches  Rickety Dick, a wretched crippled native, the sole survivor of his tribe,  once the lord of all this country, who now stretches out his horny hand to  receive charity. Rickety Dick, who can only talk Australian, lives under a  bark thatch, and leads a mendicant life, and this not owing to downright  destitution, but because such a lazy mode of existence suits him better  than a residence within the walls of a Poor's House. He finds himself more  comfortable here, and cannot bear to quit the soil on which he has passed  the greater portion of his miserable existence. Sir Daniel lets this last  scion of a decayed race want for nothing, and gratifies every wish that  the poor half idiot can form.    One excursion which no stranger omits to make is a ride to the monument  erected to La Perouse at Botany Bay, a pretty good road to which passes  through beautiful woods full of magnificent oaks, as also of _Eucalyptus_,  or gum tree, so characteristic of Australia, _Casuarina_, or cabbage tree,  _Xanthorrhea_, _Acacias_, and various descriptions of _Epacris_. The  monument itself stands on an open cleared space, in what is known as  \"Frenchmen's Gardens\" (because, according to tradition, the soldiers had  raised a few vegetables here), and is a plain sandstone obelisk about 30  feet high, standing on a pedestal and crowned with an iron globe, within  an enclosure about 35 feet square, bounded by a parapet wall of from three  to five feet high.    The inscription, which is in French, and on the south side facing the sea,  runs as follows:        A la Memoire de M. de La Perouse. Cette terre, qu'il visita en      1778, est la derniere d'ou il a fait parvenir de ses nouvelles.      Erige au nom de la France, par les soins de M. M. de      Bougainville et Ducampier commandant la Fregatte \"La Thetis\" et      la corvette \"Esperance\" en relache au port Jackson en 1825.    On the north side is an English translation of the above, and on the west  a French translation of the English inscription on the east side.  \"Foundation laid 1825. Completed 1828.\"    Close by this simple monument, more interesting owing to the subsequent  fate of the renowned French navigator than by its merits as a work of art,  is Botany Tower, a sort of look-out for the whole coast-line. This  octangular tower stands quite by itself, and commands a magnificent and  extensive view over Botany Bay. To the N.W. one perceives a flagstaff of  Banks's establishment, a pleasure resort of the Sydneyites, which, on  account of its small zoological garden, is likewise of some scientific  interest. S.E., on the opposite side of Mud Bay, is visible the point of  land where Captain Cook, accompanied by Banks and Solander, first trod the  soil of Australia. Among the sandstone rocks adjoining, a brass tablet,  with a suitable inscription, commemorates this interesting fact.    The botanical garden attracted very much of the attention of the  scientific staff. It possesses, next to that of Buitenzorg (see vol. ii.  p. 204), the largest and most valuable collection we saw throughout our  voyage. In addition to its splendid specimens of _coniferae_ and the  incomparable Dammara pine-tree; it also enjoys well-merited celebrity for  its successful rivalry with that of Java in rare specimens of palms. The  climate of Sydney is admirably adapted for experimenting on the  cultivation of plants from the most various parts of the world; and while  in one part of this garden we find the plants of every clime, which  flourish here in great luxuriance, another portion is dedicated  exclusively to the cultivation of Australian trees and canes. At the  entrance stands a magnificent _Araucaria excelsa_, like a sentinel on  guard over this singular vegetable world. A gigantic _Grevillea robusta_  attracts the eye by the striking tint of its luxuriant orange-yellow  blossoms, shining with indescribable charm through the dark green of the  foliage. _Banksias_, _Casuarinas_, different species of _Callitris_,  _Xanthorrhea_, _Proteaceae Eucalypti_, the beautiful _Telopea  speciosissima_, the giant lily (_Doryanthes excelsa_), and many others  indigenous to the Australian continent, such as never meet the European's  gaze, or, at all events, only very rarely in forcing houses, here arrest  the attention by their towering forms, their elegant foliage, and their  grand proportions, as compared with their brethren of northern climes. One  species of weeping willow (_Salex Babylonica_), which grows here in the  utmost luxuriance, has a special historic interest, as it was a shoot from  the well-known willow that overshadowed the grave of Bonaparte at St.  Helena. Through the obliging attention of the superintendent of the  garden, Mr. Charles Moore, who spared neither trouble nor pains to afford  us all the assistance in his power, our collection of Australian flora is  exceedingly plentiful and valuable. It consists not merely of a  comprehensive collection of Australian seeds and useful woods, but also of  some species of living plants, forwarded to Europe in what is known as  Ward's chest. At the same time we were successful in procuring and  sending, in accordance with his request, to Professor Rochleder, in  Prague, a Fellow of the Imperial Academy of Science, some 50 or 60 lbs. of  the raw _Epacris Grandiflora_, as also a small quantity of _Casuarina  equisetifolia_, for the purpose of chemical experiments, especially with  regard to the relations of chemistry with the geographical distribution of  plants.    At last, on 16th November, we were able to make out our long-projected  excursion to Campbelton, 33 miles distant, over a tolerably good, usually  somewhat flat, country, traversed by railroad in about two hours.    On our arrival at this small but most industrious village we found,  awaiting our arrival, our hospitable friend, Sir W. Macarthur, who took us  to his estate adjoining, called Camden Park. Sir William belongs to one of  the most distinguished families in the colony, and enjoys the double  reputation of being at once the most important wine-grower of Australia,  and of having the best wine in his cellar.    We drove to our host's house through very pretty scenery, and thus had a  fresh opportunity of satisfying ourselves of the strange inaccuracy of  former travellers, who related that the leaves in Australia were of wood  and the stems of iron, that the bees had no stings, the birds no wings,  and hair instead of feathers, the flowers no fragrance, the birds no  melody, and the trees, like so many Peter Schlemils, no shadow. Although  Nature has been guilty of some few freaks both in Australia and in New  Zealand, and has created some extraordinary animals, such, for example, as  the duck-billed platypus (_ornithorrhynchus paradoxus_), the ant-eater,  the kiwi, &c., these are but exceptions, and there are here but few  differences to be remarked in either the animal or vegetable world, such  as should distinguish it for extravagance beyond all other countries. In  Australia there are birds that sing, and odoriferous trees and flowers in  great profusion, and the forests, at those places whither the axe of the  busy settler has not yet penetrated or imparted to it a park-like aspect,  are as dense, as thickly clothed with underwood, and as difficult to make  one's way through, as in any other quarter of the globe under a similar  latitude.    Close beside the elegant residence of Sir William are extensive vineyards,  to superintend which he imported German vine-dressers from the Rheingau.  Each of these families has his own hut, a plot of garden ground, and in  addition to rations of milk, bread, and butter, receives L25 per annum  wages. When these good folks heard that strangers, compatriots of theirs,  were among them, with whom they could converse in their mother-tongue, a  dozen or so at once assembled to bid us welcome. Most of these betrayed a  certain amount of hesitation in expressing themselves in their own  language, and, like the same class in Pennsylvania, whenever they were at  a loss for a word"]]]
