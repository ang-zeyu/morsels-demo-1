And the result was that the Princess opened large, dark eyes,  stretched out her arms, yawned a little, covering her mouth with a  small brown hand, and said, quite plainly and distinctly, and  without any room at all for mistake:    \"Then the hundred years are over? How the yew hedges have  grown! Which of you is my Prince that aroused me from my deep  sleep of so many long years?\"    \"I did,\" said Jimmy fearlessly, for she did not look as though she  were going to slap anyone.    \"My noble preserver!\" said the Princess, and held out her hand.  Jimmy shook it vigorously.    \"But I say,\" said he, \"you aren't really a Princess, are you?\"    \"Of course I am,\" she answered; \"who else could I be? Look at my  crown!\" She pulled aside the spangled veil, and showed beneath it  a coronet of what even Jimmy could not help seeing to be  diamonds.    \"But \" said Jimmy.    \"Why,\" she said, opening her eyes very wide, \"you must have  known about my being here, or you'd never have come. How did  you get past the dragons?\"    Gerald ignored the question. \"I say,\" he said, \"do you really believe  in magic, and all that?\"    \"I ought to,\" she said, \"if anybody does. Look, here's the place  where I pricked my finger with the spindle.\" She showed a little  scar on her wrist.    \"Then this really is an enchanted castle?\"    \"Of course it is,\" said the Princess. \"How stupid you are!\" She  stood up, and her pink brocaded dress lay in bright waves about  her feet.    \"I said her dress would be too long,\" said Jimmy.    \"It was the right length when I went to sleep,\" said the Princess; \"it  must have grown in the hundred years.\"    \"I don't believe you're a Princess at all,\" said Jimmy; \"at least \"    \"Don't bother about believing it, if you don't like,\" said the  Princess. \"It doesn't so much matter what you believe as what I am.  She turned to the others.    \"Let's go back to the castle,\" she said, \"and I'll show you all my  lovely jewels and things. Wouldn't you like that?\"    \"Yes, said Gerald with very plain hesitation. \"But \"    \"But what?\" The Princess's tone was impatient.    \"But we're most awfully hungry.\" \"Oh, so am I!\" cried the Princess.    \"We've had nothing to eat since breakfast.\"    \"And it's three now,\" said the Princess, looking at the sun-dial.  \"Why, you've had nothing to eat for hours and hours and hours. But  think of me! I haven't had anything to eat for a hundred years.\"  Come along to the castle.    \"The mice will have eaten everything,\" said Jimmy sadly. He saw  now that she really was a Princess.    \"Not they,\" cried the Princess joyously. \"You forget everything's  enchanted here. Time simply stood still for a hundred years. Come  along, and one of you must carry my train, or I shan't be able to  move now it's grown such a frightful length.\"    When you are young so many things are difficult to believe, and  yet the dullest people will tell you that they are true such things,  for instance, as that the earth goes round the sun, and that it is not  flat but round. But the things that seem really likely, like  fairy-tales and magic, are, so say the grown-ups, not true at all. Yet  they are so easy to believe, especially when you see them  happening. And, as I am always telling you, the most wonderful  things happen to all sorts of people, only you never hear about  them because the people think that no one will believe their  stories, and so they don't tell them to any one except me. And they  tell me, because they know that I can believe anything.    When Jimmy had awakened the Sleeping Princess, and she had  invited the three children to go with her to her palace and get  something to eat, they all knew quite surely that they had come  into a place of magic happenings. And they walked in a slow  procession along the grass towards the castle. The Princess went  first, and Kathleen carried her shining train; then came Jimmy, and  Gerald came last. They were all quite sure that they had walked  right into the middle of a fairy-tale, and they were the more ready  to believe it because they were so tired and hungry. They were, in  fact, so hungry and tired that they hardly noticed where they were  going, or observed the beauties of the formal gardens through  which the pink-silk Princess was leading them. They were in a sort  of dream, from which they only partially awakened to find  themselves in a big hail, with suits of armour and old flags round  the walls, the skins of beasts on the floor, and heavy oak tables and  benches ranged along it.    The Princess entered, slow and stately, but once inside she  twitched her sheeny train out of Jimmy's hand and turned to the  three.    \"You just wait here a minute,\" she said, \"and mind you don't talk  while I'm away. This castle is crammed with magic, and I don't  know what will happen if you talk.\" And with that, picking up the  thick goldy-pink folds under her arms, she ran out, as Jimmy said  afterwards, \"most unprincesslike,\" showing as she ran black  stockings and black strap shoes.    Jimmy wanted very much to say that he didn't believe anything  would happen, only he was afraid something would happen if he  did, so he merely made a face and put out his tongue. The others  pretended not to see this, which was much more crushing than  anything they could have said. So they sat in silence, and Gerald  ground the heel of his boot upon the marble floor. Then the  Princess came back, very slowly and kicking her long skirts in  front of her at every step. She could not hold them up now because  of the tray she carried.    It was not a silver tray, as you might have expected, but an oblong  tin one. She set it down noisily on the end of the long table and  breathed a sigh of relief..    \"Oh! it was heavy,\" she said. I don't know what fairy feast the  children's fancy had been busy with. Anyhow, this was nothing like  it. The heavy tray held a loaf of bread, a lump of cheese, and a  brown jug of water. The rest of its heaviness was just plates and  mugs and knives.    \"Come along,\" said the Princess hospitably. \"I couldn't find  anything but bread and cheese but it doesn't matter, because  everything's magic here, and unless you have some dreadful secret  fault the bread and cheese will turn into anything you like. What  would you like?\" she asked Kathleen.    \"Roast chicken,\" said Kathleen, without hesitation.    The pinky Princess cut a slice of bread and laid it on a dish.    \"There you are,\" she said, \"roast chicken. Shall I carve it, or will  you?\"    \"You, please,\" said Kathleen, and received a piece of dry bread on  a plate.    \"Green peas?\" asked the Princess, cut a piece of cheese and laid it  beside the bread.    Kathleen began to eat the bread, cutting it up with knife and fork  as you would eat chicken. It was no use owning that she didn't see  any chicken and peas, or anything but cheese and dry bread,  because that would be owning that she had some dreadful secret  fault.    \"If I have, it is a secret, even from me,\" she told herself.    The others asked for roast beef and cabbage and got it, she  supposed, though to her it only looked like dry bread and Dutch  cheese.    \"I do wonder what my dreadful secret fault is,\" she thought, as the  Princess remarked that, as for her, she could fancy a slice of roast  peacock. \"This one, she added, lifting a second mouthful of dry  bread on her fork, \"is quite delicious.\"    \"It's a game, isn't it?\" asked Jimmy suddenly.    \"What's a game?\" asked the Princess, frowning.    \"Pretending it's beef the bread and cheese, I mean.\"    \"A game? But it is beef. Look at it,\" said the Princess, opening her  eyes very wide.    \"Yes, of course,\" said Jimmy feebly. \"I was only joking.\"    Bread and cheese is not perhaps so good as roast beef or chicken  or peacock (I'm not sure about the peacock. I never tasted peacock,  did you?); but bread and cheese is, at any rate, very much better  than nothing when you have gone on having nothing since  breakfast (gooseberries and ginger-beer hardly count) and it is long  past your proper dinner-time. Everyone ate and drank and felt  much better.    \"Now,\" said the Princess, brushing the bread crumbs off her green  silk lap, \"if you're sure you won't have any more meat you can  come and see my treasures. Sure you won't take the least bit more  chicken? No? Then follow me.\"    She got up and they followed her down the long hall to the end  where the great stone stairs ran up at each side and joined in a  broad flight leading to the gallery above. Under the stairs was a  hanging of tapestry.    \"Beneath this arras,\" said the Princess, \"is the door leading to my  private apartments.\" She held the tapestry up with both hands, for  it was heavy, and showed a little door that had been hidden by it.    \"The key,\" she said, \"hangs above.\"    And so it did, on a large rusty nail.    \"Put it in,\" said the Princess, \"and turn it.\" Gerald did so, and the  great key creaked and grated in the lock.    \"Now push,\" she said; \"push hard, all of you. They pushed hard, all  of them. The door gave way, and they fell over each other into the  dark space beyond.    The Princess dropped the curtain and came after them, closing the  door behind her.    \"Look out!\" she said; \"look out!\" there are two steps down.    \"Thank you,\" said Gerald, rubbing his knee at the bottom of the  steps. \"We found that out for ourselves.\" \"I'm sorry,\" said the  Princess, \"but you can't have hurt yourselves much. Go straight on.  There aren't any more steps.\"    They went straight on in the dark.    \"When you come to the door just turn the handle and go in. Then  stand still till I find the matches. I know where they are.\"    \"Did they have matches a hundred years ago?\" asked Jimmy.    \"I meant the tinder-box,\" said the Princess"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35409"],[0,"Beauty: Illustrated Chiefly (#4)"],[1,"statue.    Can the power of Beauty be better illustrated than in this simple tale? We  are not shown simply its effect upon an uneducated, artless  individual--upon a mind in its singleness, and just awakened to its own  capabilities of suffering and joy--but we see it operating in a wide and  unquestioned influence, upon the spirit of a whole people. It was not  demanded by fate that there should be merely a replacing of the piece of  marble upon the pedestal from which it had been torn--it was required that  the statue should be as royal in its _Beauty_ as that was whose place it  should supply. Beauty was the spirit-word of the destiny of Miletus. It  was Beauty which had been guardian of the city--and it was Beauty which  must now restore it, by her return to her temple.    But we will not dwell upon this story, though it so beautifully  exemplifies the position we maintain. There are many instances of frequent  occurrence in the world, which tell as strong a tale, of the influence of  Grace and Beauty, as is here presented in the Grecian record. We may not  witness them--but the power is working ever like fate in the mingled  material of our life; and it only requires a sober faith, together with a  moderate observation, to convince all men that they are the creatures of  Beauty, as much as they are of destiny and dust.    But there is another consideration connected with this subject--an  important one, too--and for that reason we have reserved it to the last.    We are settled in our conviction that there is something in Personal  Beauty, of a representative and correspondent character. It represents a  spiritual beauty--corresponds with a moral symmetry. Though we call it an  _outward_ property, still it must be a picture of the _internal_. It would  seem impossible that there can be a speaking expression of grace and  loveliness, upon a face that is but a telegraph of an inward deformity and  ugliness. Perhaps all this may seem somewhat ideal in its philosophy--and,  perhaps, almost transcendental. But we hold it to be true. It certainly  appears to us reasonable that the minor should reflect the reality, as  well in this heaven-made humanity, as amid the earthy art of our  drawing-rooms. That the spirit should speak out in the language of the  countenance, is to us as excellent sense as that it should tell its story  in protuberances and indentations. Who can deny this--and where will the  argument fail? We pause for a reply.    Let us be understood, however. We have no idea of going beyond reason in a  theory, which, though it may appear more than plausible to us, may seem  far this side of plausible to others. Yet we think we are borne out by  example. We do not maintain, it will be remembered, that beauty of person  must necessarily be the representative of _moral beauty_, according to the  best and highest definition of that term. That definition, we presume,  would include the virtuous and the heavenly. That these traits are  unfailing accompaniments of noble features--the beautiful countenance--the  finished form--it would be hazardous and foolish to assert. What we intend  to say is this--that we believe external beauty is the representation of  an internal and spiritual quality of the same nature. That Beauty may be  spiritual, though it may not be moral--the Beauty of Virtue. It may be the  beauty of superior and surpassing powers--the Beauty of Genius. It may be  the beauty of a mind, uncommon in its attractions, and in its proportions  beyond fault or question. It may be the beauty of intellectual  symmetry--and this may find its speaking resemblance in the chiseled face  and figure, as certainly as the moral loveliness of the  heaven-inspired--the emphatically _good_ man. Of what more perfect mental  proportions could the human countenance have been indicative, than the  countenance of Napoleon? The symmetry of Genius spake there, if it _was_  true--as it certainly was--that moral beauty had no telegraph in that  splendid sculpture of the man.    But we have said as much as we can afford to--though the more particular  subject of our remarks--or what in good faith should have been, if it has  not--Beauty in Woman, would seem to be one on which it would not be deemed  unknightly to give way to a pretty expression. We must, however, leave all  considerations of gallantry on this score, to others who can amplify  better than we can, when we have got to the end of our chapter.          ADVERTISEMENT.      There is perhaps no subject more universally or more deeply interesting  than that which is the chief subject of the present work. Yet no book,  even pretending to science or accuracy, has hitherto appeared upon it. The  forms and proportions of animals--as of the horse and the dog--have been  examined in a hundred volumes: not one has been devoted to woman, on whose  physical and moral qualities the happiness of individuals, and the  perpetual improvement of the human race, are dependant.    The cause of this has been, probably, the neglect on the part of  individuals, to combine anatomical and physiological knowledge with the  critical observation of the external forms of woman; and, perhaps, some  repugnance to anthropological knowledge on the part of the public. The  last obstacle, if ever it existed, is now gone by, as many circumstances  show; and it will be the business of the author, in this work, to endeavor  to obviate the former.    The present work, beside giving new views of the theory of beauty, and of  its application to the arts, presents an analysis and classification of  beauty in woman. A subsequent work will apply the principles here  established to intermarriages and crossings among mankind, and will  explain their results in relation to the happiness of individuals, and to  the beauty and the freedom from insanity of their offspring. A final work  will examine the relations of woman in society, will expose the  extravagant hypothesis of writers on this subject who have been ignorant  of anthropology, and will describe the reforms which the common interests  of mankind demand in this respect.    It is now to be seen, whether a branch of science which is strictly  founded on anatomy and physiology--one which entangles the reader in no  mystical and delusive hypothesis, and presents to him only indisputable  facts--one which is applicable to the subject most universally and deeply  interesting to mankind, the critical judgment of female beauty, as founded  on necessary functions--and one which unravels the greater difficulties  which that subject presents--may not excite and permanently command a  great degree of public interest.    A preliminary view of the importance of this subject is given in the first  chapter; the urgency of its discussion, in relation to the interests of  decency and morality, is established in the second; and some useful  cautions as to youth are offered in the third.    In regard to the importance of the subject, I may, even here, avail myself  of the highest authorities.    THOMAS MORE, speaking of the people of his commonwealth, says: \"They do  greatly wonder at the folly of all other nations, which, in _buying a  colt_ (whereas, a little money is in hazard), be so chary and circumspect,  that, though he be almost all bare, yet they will not buy him, unless the  saddle and all the harness be taken off--lest, under those coverings, be  hid some gall or sore. And yet, in _choosing a wife_, which shall be  either pleasure or displeasure to them all their life after, they be so  reckless, that, all the residue of the woman's body being covered with  clothes, they esteem her scarcely by one hand-breadth (for they can see no  more but her face), and so to join her to them, not without great jeopardy  of evil agreeing together--if anything in her body afterward should chance  to offend and mislike them.\"[1]    FRANCIS BACON is of similar opinion.    Happily, the advancement of anthropological science in modern times, may,  as is here shown, be so applied as to render quite unnecessary the  _objectionable methods_ proposed by both these philosophers, in order to  carry their doctrines into practice.    _Shall I be blamed, because I avail myself of the progress of knowledge to  render all that these great men desired on this subject of easy attainment  and inoffensive to woman? Shall I be blamed, because I first facilitate  that which the still farther advancement of knowledge will inevitably  render an everyday occurrence, and the guide of the most important act of  human life?_--I care not.    In the details as to female beauty, it will be seen how incorrectly  Winckelmann says: \"In female figures, the forms of beauty are not so  different, nor the gradations so various, as in those of males; and  therefore in general they present no other difference than that which is  dependant upon age.... Hence, in treating of female beauty, few  observations occur as necessary to be made, and the study of the artist is  more limited and more easy.... It is to be observed, that, in speaking of  the resemblance of nude female figures, I speak solely of the body,  without concluding from it that they also resemble each other in the  distinctive characters of the head, which are particularly marked in each,  whether goddess or heroine.\"--The differences, even in the bodies of  females, are here shown to be both numerous and capable of distinct  classification.    It is right to observe, that this work has nothing to do with an early  production of the writer, a consciousness of the small value of which  prevented his attaching his name to it, which he now knows to be utterly  worthless, and which has since been vamped up with things which are more  worthless still.    The most valuable features of the present work are entirely new and  original. Others are such as the writer thought not unworthy of  preservation from earlier essays. He has also, throughout this"]]]
