[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34736"],[0,"True Christianity (#4)"],[1,"nchthon--a sad example of the  clouded views of men at that time respecting religious liberty and the  right of civil rulers to punish men for their errors in the faith.    § 17. In the Palatinate (the ancient _Pfalz_, the territories of which are  now distributed among Bavaria, Prussia, etc.) the Lutheran Church had been  established, and popery ceased to exist. But in 1560, a few years after  Arndt's birth, the Elector, Frederick III., withdrew from the church, and  adopted the Reformed faith and usages. His successor, Lewis VI.,  endeavored to restore the ascendency of Lutheranism; but after his brief  reign, the authorities which succeeded, established \"Calvinism\" (the term  employed in Church History) on a permanent basis. A similar  ecclesiastico-civil revolution occurred in Bremen in 1562; fourteen  Lutheran pastors and the Lutheran members of the City Council were  expelled, and the city became Reformed. Such changes occurred elsewhere.  Both parties were undoubtedly more or less honest in adhering to their  doctrinal views; and both claimed the right to depose and exile those of  an opposite faith, whenever the civil and political power was, in either  case, directed by them.    § 18. Let it now be remembered that these contending Protestants, Lutheran  and Reformed or Calvinistic, were led by men respectively, who were  confessedly intelligent, learned, and endowed with great abilities, many  of whom were not only honest in expressing their convictions, but also  conscientious in their conduct, whether they were governed by an erring or  an enlightened conscience. That the latter is historically true, is  demonstrated by their readiness, when they lost power, to submit to  imprisonment or exile, rather than to renounce their respective creeds.  They were all too well acquainted with Bible truth to look with other  feelings than with horror on the popish creed. But while their own  Protestant creed was very precious to their souls, they could not tolerate  any departure from it, even if that departure was _not_ in the direction  \"towards Rome.\" That departure must, as they judged, necessarily be  equivalent to a denial of God's truth, as they believed that they had  found it in the Bible. Thus all were alike sensitive--all seemed to feel  that if they tolerated any error, _that_ error could not be trivial--it  was, as far as it extended, a denial of God's truth. Could they safely  assume the shame and guilt of such a sin? We may add, that we are here  speaking only of the _honest_ leaders of the Lutherans and the Reformed,  of whom each man judged and acted for himself, as one who was accountable  to God. No honest Reformed theologian would have screened a Reformed  heretic from condemnation; and no honest Lutheran would, for a moment,  have tolerated a nominal Lutheran, who rejected any part of the creed of  the church.    § 19. At the same time, all these men were fallible creatures, subject to  all the errors of judgment, and to all the passions and infirmities  incident to fallen man. They often supposed that their intentions were  pure, when selfish motives governed them, and their jealous guardianship  of God's truth was combined with a jealous love for their personal  opinions. It was under these circumstances, when each party watched with  extreme jealousy over the purity of the faith, as adopted by it, and when,  besides, many private interests--personal, political, and  pecuniary--exercised vast influence, that Arndt entered on his labors.--We  have introduced the above details, in order to explain his declarations in  the preface to Book I. § 8, that he rejects the Synergistic, Majoristic,  etc., errors, and entertains no other views except those which are set  forth in the Lutheran Symbolical Books.    § 20. When he commenced his labors in Brunswick, he was the youngest  member of the \"ministerium\" of the city, that is, of the college composed  of the pastors of the several city churches, all of which at that time  strictly adhered to the Lutheran creed. He had long lamented that, in  consequence of the infelicity of the times, which caused endless doctrinal  controversies, the parties of which were many, Papists, Mystics,  Unitarians, Reformed, Lutherans, etc., the attention of many persons was  diverted from the practical duties of a Christian life, and directed  exclusively to controversies on points of doctrine; the result was, that  the understanding was actively exercised, but the heart was not properly  affected. Such considerations induced him to write Book I. of his \"True  Christianity.\" It was his object to show that God demands a holy life,  proceeding from faith in Christ, and that no jealousy concerning the  purity of the creed will atone for the absence of the fruits of the  Spirit, as exhibited in the life and conduct of the individual. Hence he  insists with a warmth unusual in that excited and controversial age, on  repentance, on faith in Christ, and on a holy life. Possibly, the  apparently sweeping assertions which occasionally occur in his writings,  to the effect that the majority of his contemporaries lacked a heavenly  spirit, acquired their sombre hue in consequence of the publicity given to  human frailties, and the retirement and shade in which vast numbers of  holy men preferred to dwell. His Book I., which constitutes the principal  part of the work, was first published in Jena, in the year 1605; a second  and improved edition appeared in 1607.    § 21. It consisted principally of the matter which he had introduced in a  course of practical sermons previously delivered by him on week-days. It  attracted great attention, and was rapidly circulated throughout Germany.  The modest and retiring author, without expecting such a result, at once  became a celebrity. Nevertheless, new trials now commenced. An envious  feeling seems to have been engendered in the hearts of several of his  colleagues in the \"ministerium\" of the city, when they noticed the honor  which the author had undesignedly gained. Perhaps, too, the controversial  spirit of the times, and the jealousy of good men respecting the faith,  which was assailed on all sides--by Papists, Calvinists, Unitarians,  fanatics, etc.,--may have led them to scrutinize the book with too  suspicious eyes. All held firmly to the Gospel doctrine of Justification  by faith alone, without works. Now, when they found that Arndt insisted  with such earnestness on the evidences of faith, as furnished by a holy  life, they were morbidly affected, and apprehended that the doctrine of  justification by faith _alone_, which their bitter enemies, the Papists,  denounced, had not been guarded with sufficient care by Arndt. Other  expressions, again, which they did not interpret impartially, led them to  fear that he was introducing mysticism and other morbid religious systems  into the Church. The reproaches which he was compelled to hear, deterred  him for some time from fulfilling his promise of adding three other  \"Books\" to Book I. The complete work may be regarded as consisting of  _Four_ Books, as published in 1609. At a considerably later period a  fifth, and then a sixth book, were added. The former was designed as an  explanation and recapitulation of the Four Books, and the latter,  consisting in part of letters addressed to various eminent theologians,  besides having the same object in view, was intended also to defend the  doctrinal and ethical positions assumed in the Four Books. As they partake  of the nature of an appendix, and refer, to some extent, to  misunderstandings belonging to an earlier age, the Latin versions omit  them, and this example was followed by the English translator.    § 22. Arndt was freed from the unpleasant relations in which he stood to  his colleagues in Brunswick, in which city he had spent about ten years,  by a call which he received in 1608 to enter a new field of labor in  Eisleben. This city, which, as in the days of Luther (who was born and  baptized, and who also died there), still belonged to the territory of the  Counts of Mansfeld, is at present incorporated with the kingdom of Prussia  (Province of Saxony). It was here that Arndt ventured to publish the whole  of the Four Books of his \"True Christianity.\" In this new position, his  admirable character and spirit were justly appreciated alike by his  patrons, the Counts of Mansfeld, by his colleagues, and by the people. The  fidelity with which he remained at his post during the prevalence of an  epidemic that carried off many of the inhabitants, his self-sacrificing  spirit in the discharge of his pastoral duties, and his judicious course  as an assessor of the local consistory, demonstrated the true nobility of  his soul--the spirit of the divine Redeemer. However, even though his  relations with all who surrounded him were of the most friendly character,  he did not remain longer than about two years and a half in Eisleben. He  had been repeatedly invited to assume important charges, which he declined  to accept; for while he had often found opponents, his great personal  merit, his eminent services, both as a preacher of the Gospel and as an  author of devotional works, and his godly spirit, had secured for him the  respect, confidence, and love of the whole religious public. Duke George  of Brunswick-Lueneburg, who at that time resided in Celle (Zelle), invited  him, in the year 1611, to accept the two offices of court-preacher and of  General Superintendent of ecclesiastical affairs in the principalities of  Brunswick and Lueneburg. (Celle was subsequently attached to the kingdom of  Hanover, but has, in the most recent times, been absorbed, with the  contiguous territories, by Prussia.) The Count of Mansfeld very  reluctantly consented to Arndt's removal; the latter, however, believed  that it had become his duty to enter the wide and inviting field of labor  which Providence had opened to him.

Australia is the wonderland of the scientist and of the Nature-lover.  It is a great living \"museum,\" stocked with marvels of many kinds,  including so-called \"living fossils,\" the sole survivors of otherwise  extinct groups of animals.    Competent authorities have proposed to divide the world, biologically,  into two parts--Australia and the rest of the world, and they have  considered Australia the more important part.    This division was based mainly on the study of mammals--animals which  suckle their young--for Australia is the home of the two surviving  members of the lowest group of mammals--Monotremata, the egg-laying  Platypus (_Ornithorhynchus_), and the Spiny Ant-eater (_Echidna_).  Further, marsupials, except for two kinds found in America, are  confined to this long-isolated southern land.    Here, shut off from the severe competition experienced by the animals  of northern lands, marsupials were modified so that they were adapted  for life in almost every realm utilized by the higher mammals of other  countries. Thus there are herbivorous, carnivorous, and insectivorous  marsupials. Owing, probably, to the advent of Bats--true flying  mammals--at, possibly, a comparatively early time, the marsupial was  beaten in the air, and so a true flying form was not evolved, though  the so-called \"Flying Phalanger\" is some distance on the way.    As regards the other group of flying animals--birds--Australia is even  of greater interest, for here are found unique archaic forms of life,  such as the Emu, Cassowary, Mound-Builders, and Lyre-Birds, and  \"every widely-spread family of birds but two is represented; the only  widely-spread families of birds totally absent from Australia  are Woodpeckers and Vultures.\" Woodpeckers, however, have crossed  Wallace's line into Celebes and adjacent islands, and may yet reach  Australia naturally.    Further, many well-known birds, such as Pigeons, Parrots, and  Kingfishers, reach their highest development in the Australian region,  and, more important still, the whole bird world seems to reach its  culminating point in this wonderland. It is a factor adding to the  interest of Australia's fauna that three of the four families placed  at the head of the bird world in the natural system of classification  adopted by ornithologists, and used by Dr. Sharpe in his just recently  completed _Hand-List of Birds_, should be absolutely confined to the  Australian Continent and adjacent islands. Thus Australia can justly  claim to be the most highly developed of regions, so far as birds  are concerned, for Bower-Birds, Birds of Paradise, and Bell-Magpies  (_Streperas_) are peculiar, while the penultimate family--the Crow  family--is shared with the other regions of the world.    Thus, with regard to birds, the term \"fossil continent\" applied to  Australia is not appropriate, as it is but partly true.    Since the birds native to Australia are so interesting in themselves,  and are so varied in kind, Australians should know, love, and  jealously protect these beautiful creatures. Strict regulations should  be framed to prevent the exploitation of Nature's gifts by those who  destroy useful or precious and rare birds for the sake of gain. Even  collectors, who, under the guise of scientific work, collect eggs, and  kill birds to trade in their skins, should be supervized.    Let us now consider the different groups of birds. Living birds were  formerly divided into two sub-classes--(1) _Ratitae_ (Lat., _ratis_, a  raft), and (2) _Carinatae_ (Lat., _carina_, a keel). The first is  the small group of flightless, running birds, made up of five living  birds, all inhabiting southern lands. These are the Emu and Cassowary  of Australia, the Ostrich of South Africa, the Rhea or South American  Ostrich, and the Kiwi or Apteryx of New Zealand. Taken together with  other evidence, all pointing in the same way, these birds have led  scientists to think of a great southern land mass connecting the  southern lands, for the Emu did not fly here, nor did the Rhea fly  to South America, but they must have reached their present home by a  land-bridge not necessarily complete at any one time. As these birds  do not fly, they have no big wing-muscles, and so do not need the  ridge of bone down the breast. Thus they belong to the sub-class, the  members of which have a raft-like breast bone. The other living birds  were placed in the sub-class the members of which have a keel on the  breast bone for the attachment of the wing-muscles.    Recently, however, Pycraft, a leading ornithologist, has proposed to  base the division into sub-classes on the characters of the bones of  the palate instead of those of the breast-bone. Thus, he places the  sixth family of birds--the Tinamous, of South America--with the ratite  birds, to form his primitive group--_Palaeognathae_ (\"old jaw\"), while  the members of the old sub-class _Carinatae_, minus the Tinamous,  constitute his second division, the _Neognathae_ (\"new jaw\").    Mr. Gregory Mathews, the first part of whose projected great work  on Australian Birds has just come to hand, has followed Dr. Bowdler  Sharpe in accepting this classification, so we must follow too, as  Mathews' work will probably be our standard for years to come. The  large number of Australian birds belonging to this second sub-class is  now divided into 20 orders, which with the Emu order, make a total of  21 orders of birds represented in Australia.    Now, let us consider the birds in each order. The best-known member  of the first Australian order is the Emu, a bird well known to all,  though, unfortunately, becoming very rare, so that few persons in the  settled districts now enjoy the privilege of seeing an Emu in a wild  state.    ====      [Page 12]      [Illustration: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]]        CLASS.--AVES.--BIRDS.
