Throughout its life the veery seems to show a distrust of us  that, try as we may, few have ever overcome.    If you have thought that the thrush-like, cinnamon brown,  speckle-breasted bird, with a long twitching tail like a catbird's,  and a song as fine as a catbird's best, would be mentioned among the  robin's relations, you must guess again, for he is the brown thrasher,  not a thrush at all. You will find him in the Group of Lively Singers.    {16}    {17}    CHAPTER II    SOME NEIGHBOURLY ACROBATS        Chickadee    Tufted Titmouse    White-breasted Nuthatch    Red-breasted Nuthatch    Ruby-crowned Kinglet    Golden-crowned Kinglet    {18}    {19}    THE CHICKADEE    _Called also: Black-capped Titmouse_    Bitterly cold and dreary though the day may be, that \"little scrap of  valour,\" the chickadee, keeps his spirits high until ours cannot but  be cheered by the oft-repeated, clear, tinkling silvery notes that  spell his name. _Chicka-dee-dee: chicka-dee-dee:_ he introduces  himself. How easy it would be for every child to know the birds if all  would but sing out their names so clearly! Oh, don't you wish they  would?      \"Piped a tiny voice near by    Gay and polite--a cheerful cry--    _Chick-chickadeedee!_ Saucy note    Out of sound heart and merry throat.    As if it said, 'Good day, good Sir!    Fine afternoon, old passenger!    Happy to meet you in these places    Where January brings few faces.'\"    No bird, except the wren, is more cheerful than the chickadee, and his  cheerfulness, fortunately, is just as \"catching\" as measels. None will  respond more promptly to your whistle in imitation of his three very  high, clear call notes, and come nearer and nearer to make quite sure  you {20} are only a harmless mimic. He is very inquisitive. Although  not a bird may be in sight when you first whistle his call, nine  chances out of ten there will be a faint echo from some far distant  throat before very long; and by repeating the notes at short intervals  you will have, probably, not one but several echoes from as many  different chickadees whose curiosity to see you soon gets the better  of their appetites and brings them flying, by easy stages, to the tree  above your head. Where there is one chickadee there are apt to be more  in the neighbourhood; for these sociable, active, cheerful little  black-capped fellows in gray like to hunt for their living in loose  scattered flocks throughout the fall and winter. When they come near  enough, notice the pale rusty wash on the sides of their under parts  which are more truly dirty white than gray. Chickadees are wonderfully  tame: except the chipping sparrow, perhaps the tamest birds that we  have. Patient people, who know how to whistle up these friendly  sprites, can sometimes draw them close enough to touch, and an elect  few, who have the special gift of winning a wild bird's confidence,  can induce the chickadee to alight upon their hands.    Blessed with a thick coat of fat under his soft, fluffy gray feathers,  a hardy constitution and a sunny disposition, what terrors has the  winter for him? When the thermometer goes down, {21} his spirits seem  to go up the higher. Dangling like a circus acrobat on the cone of  some tall pine tree; standing on an outstretched twig, then turning  over and hanging with his black-capped head downward from the high  trapeze; carefully inspecting the rough bark on the twigs for a fat  grub or a nest of insect eggs, he is constantly hunting for food and  singing grace between bites. His _day, day, day_, sung softly over and  over again, seems to be his equivalent for \"Give us this day our daily  bread.\"    How delightfully he and his busy friends, who are always within call,  punctuate the snow-muffled, mid-winter silence with their ringing  calls of good cheer! The orchards where chickadees, titmice,  nuthatches, and kinglets have dined all winter, will contain few  worm-eaten apples next season. Here is a puzzle for your arithmetic  class: If one chickadee eats four hundred and forty-four eggs of the  apple tree moth on Monday, three hundred and thirty-three eggs of the  canker worm on Tuesday, and seven hundred and seventy-seven  miscellaneous grubs, larvae, and insect eggs on Wednesday and  Thursday, how long will it take a flock of twenty-two chickadees to  rid an orchard of every-unspeakable pest? One very wise and thrifty  fruit grower I know attracts to his trees all the winter birds from  far and near, by keeping on several shelves nailed up in his orchard,  {22} bits of suet, cheap raisins, raw peanuts chopped fine, cracked  hickory nuts and rinds of pork. The free lunch counters are freely  patronised. There is scarcely an hour in the day, no matter how cold,  when some hungry feathered neighbour may not be seen helping himself  to the heating, fattening food he needs to keep his blood warm.    At the approach of warm weather, chickadees retreat from public gaze  to become temporary recluses in damp, deep woods or woodland swamps  where insects are most plentiful. For a few months they give up their  friendly flocking ways and live in pairs. Long journeys they do not  undertake from the North when it is time to nest; but Southern birds  move northward in the spring. Happily the chickadee may find a  woodpecker's vacant hole in some hollow tree; worse luck if a new  excavation must be made in a decayed birch--the favourite nursery.  Wool from the sheep pasture, felt from fern fronds, bits of bark,  moss, hair, and the fur of \"little beasts of field and wood\"--anything  soft that may be picked up goes to line the hollow cradle in the  tree-trunk. How the crowded chickadee babies must swelter in their bed  of fur and feathers tucked inside a close, stuffy hole! Is it not  strange that such hardy parents should coddle their children so?      [Illustration]  The chickadee at her front door.      [Illustration]  Young nuthatches learning their first lesson in balancing on a  horizontal bar.    {23}    TUFTED TITMOUSE    _Called also: Peto Bird; Crested Tomtit; Crested Titmouse_      Don't expect to meet the tufted titmouse if you live very far north of  Washington. He is common only in the South and West.    This pert and lively cousin of the lovable little chickadee is not  quite so friendly and far more noisy. _Peto-peto-peto_ comes his loud,  clear whistle from the woods and clearings where he and his large  family are roving restlessly about all through the autumn and winter.  A famous musician became insane because he heard one note ringing  constantly in his overwrought brain. If you ever hear a troupe of  titmice whistling _Peto_ over and over again for hours at a time, you  will pity poor Schumann and fear a similar fate for the birds. But  they seem to delight in the two tiresome notes, uttered sometimes in  one key, sometimes in another. Another call--_day-day-day_--reminds  you of the chickadee's, only the tufted titmouse's voice is louder and  a little hoarse, as it well might be from such constant use.    Few birds that we see about our homes wear a top knot on their heads.  The big cardinal has a handsome red one, the larger blue jay's is  bluish gray, the cedar waxwing's is a Quaker {24} drab; but the little  titmouse, who is the size of an English sparrow, may be named at once  by the gray pointed crest that makes him look so pert and jaunty. When  he hangs head downward from the trapeze on the oak tree, this little  gray acrobat's peaked cap seems to be falling off; whereas the black  skull cap on the smaller chickadee fits close to his head no matter  how much he turns over the bar and dangles.    Neither one of these cousins is a carpenter like the woodpecker. The  titmouse has a short, stout bill without a chisel on it, which is why  it cannot chip out a hole for a nest in a tree trunk or old stump  unless the wood is much decayed. You see why these birds are so  pleased to find a deserted woodpecker's hole. Not alone are they saved  the trouble of making one, but a deep tunnel in a tree-trunk means  security for their babies against hawks, crows, jays, and other foes,  as well as against wind and rain.    When you find a flock of either chickadees or titmice, you may be sure  it is made up chiefly, if not entirely, of the birds of one or two  broods of the same parents. Their families are usually large and the  members devoted to one another. Titmice nest in April so that you  cannot tell the brothers and sisters from the father and mother when  the troupe of acrobats leave the woods in {25} early autumn and  whistle lustily about your home.      WHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH  _Called also: Tree Mouse; Devil Downhead._    When it comes to acrobatic performances in the trees, neither the  chickadee nor the titmouse can rival their relatives, the little  bluish gray nuthatches. Indeed, any circus might be glad to secure  their expert services. Hanging fearlessly from the topmost branches of  the tallest pine, running along the under side of horizontal limbs as  comfortably as along the top of them, or descending the trunk head  foremost, these wonderful little gymnasts keep their nerves as cool as  the thermometer in January. From the way they travel over any part of  the tree they wish, from top and tip to the bottom of it, no wonder  they are sometimes called Tree Mice. Only the fly that walks across  the ceiling, however, can compete with them in clinging to the under  side of boughs.    Why don't they fall off? If you ever have a chance, examine their  claws. These, you will see, are very much curved and have sharp little  hooks that catch in any crack or rough place in the bark and easily  support the bird's weight. As a general rule the chickadee keeps to  the {26} end of the twigs and the smaller branches; the tufted  titmouse rids the larger boughs of insects, eggs, and worms hidden in  the scaly bark; but the nuthatches can "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38253"],[0,"A Description of the Coasts of East Africa and Malabar in the Beginning of the (#4)"],[1,"dwells, and from there to the city of  Benamatapa there are six days journey, and the road goes from  Sofala, inland, towards the Cape of Good Hope. And in the said  Benamatapa, which is a very large town, the king is used to make his  longest residence; and it is thence that the merchants bring to  Sofala the gold which they sell to the Moors without weighing it,  for coloured stuffs and beads of Cambay, which are much used and  valued amongst them; and the people of this city of Benamatapa say  that this gold comes from still further off towards the Cape of Good  Hope, from another kingdom subject to this king of Benamatapa, who  is a great lord, and holds many other kings as his subjects, and  many other lands, which extend far inland, both towards the Cape of  Good Hope and towards Mozambich. And in this town he is each day  served with large presents, which the kings and lords, his subjects,  send to him; and when they bring them, they carry them bareheaded  through all the city, until they arrive at the palace, from whence  the king sees them come from a window, and he orders them to be  taken up from there, and the bearers do not see him, but only hear  his words; and afterwards, he bids them call the persons who have  brought these presents, and he dismisses them. This king constantly  takes with him into the field a captain, whom they call Sono, with a  great quantity of men-at-arms, and amongst them they bring six  thousand women, who also bear arms and fight. With these forces he  goes about subduing and pacifying whatever kings rise up or desire  to revolt. The said king of Benamatapa sends, each year, many  honourable persons throughout his kingdoms to all the towns and  lordships, to give them new regulations, so that all may do them  obeisance, which is in this manner: each one of the envoys comes to  a town, and bids the people extinguish all the fires that there are  in it; and after they have been put out, all the inhabitants go to  this man who has been sent as commissary, to get fresh fire from him  in sign of subjection and obedience; and, whoever should not do this  is held as a rebel, and the king immediately sends the number of  people that are necessary to destroy him, and these pass through all  the towns at their expense: their rations are meat, rice, and oil of  sesame.[10]      RIVER ZUAMA.    Leaving Sofala for Mozambich, at forty leagues from it, there is a  very large river, which is called the Zuama;[11] and it is said that  it goes towards Benamatapa,[12] and it extends more than 160  leagues. In the mouth of this river there is a town of the Moors,  which has a king, and it is called Mongalo.[13] Much gold comes from  Benamatapa to this town of the Moors, by this river, which makes  another branch which falls at Angos, where the Moors make use of  boats (almadias), which are boats hollowed out from a single trunk,  to bring the cloths and other merchandise from Angos, and to  transport much gold and ivory.      ANGOY.    After passing this river of Zuama, at xl leagues from it, there is a  town of the Moors on the sea coast, which is called Angoy,[14] and  has a king, and the Moors who live there are all merchants, and deal  in gold, ivory, silk, and cotton stuffs, and beads of Cambay, the  same as do those of Sofala. And the Moors bring these goods from  Quiloa, and Monbaza, and Melynde, in small vessels hidden from the  Portuguese ships; and they carry from there a great quantity of  ivory, and much gold. And in this town of Angos there are plenty of  provisions of millet, rice, and some kinds of meat. These men are  very brown and copper coloured; they go naked from the waist  upwards, and from thence downwards, they wrap themselves with cloths  of cotton and silk, and wear other cloths folded after the fashion  of cloaks, and some wear caps and others hoods, worked with stuffs  and silks; and they speak the language belonging to the country,  which is that of the Pagans, and some of them speak Arabic. These  people are sometimes in obedience to the king of Portugal, and at  times they throw it off, for they are a long way off from the  Portuguese forts.      MOZAMBIQUE ISLAND.    Having passed this town of Anguox, on the way to India, there are  very near to the land three islands, one of which is inhabited by  Moors, and is called Mozambique.[15] It has a very good port, and  all the Moors touch there who are sailing to Sofala, Zuama, or  Anguox. Amongst these Moors there is a sheriff, who governs them,  and does justice. These are of the language and customs of the Moors  of Anguox, in which island the King of Portugal now holds a fort,  and keeps the said Moors under his orders and government. At this  island the Portuguese ships provide themselves with water and wood,  fish and other kinds of provisions; and at this place they refit  those ships which stand in need of repair. And from this island  likewise the Portuguese fort in Sofala draws its supplies, both of  Portuguese goods and of the produce of India, on account of the road  being longer by the mainland.    Opposite this island there are many very large elephants and wild  animals. The country is inhabited by Gentiles, brutish people who go  naked and smeared all over with coloured clay, and their natural  parts wrapped in a strip of blue cotton stuff, without any other  covering; and they have their lips pierced with three holes in each  lip, and in these holes they wear bones stuck in, and claws, and  small stones, and other little things dangling from them.      ISLAND OF QUILOA.    After passing this place and going towards India, there is another  island close to the mainland, called Quiloa,[16] in which there is a  town of the Moors, built of handsome houses of stone and lime, and  very lofty, with their windows like those of the Christians; in the  same way it has streets, and these houses have got their terraces,  and the wood worked in with the masonry, with plenty of gardens, in  which there are many fruit trees and much water. This island has got  a king over it, and from hence there is trade with Sofala with  ships, which carry much gold, which is dispersed thence through all  Arabia Felix, for henceforward all this country is thus named on  account of the shore of the sea being peopled with many towns and  cities of the Moors; and when the King of Portugal discovered this  land, the Moors of Sofala, and Zuama, and Anguox, and Mozambique,  were all under obedience to the King of Quiloa, who was a great king  amongst them. And there is much gold in this town, because all the  ships which go to Sofala touch at this island, both in going and  coming back. These people are Moors, of a dusky colour, and some of  them are black and some white; they are very well dressed with rich  cloths of gold, and silk, and cotton, and the women also go very  well dressed out with much gold and silver in chains and bracelets  on their arms, and legs, and ears. The speech of these people is  Arabic, and they have got books of the Alcoran, and honour greatly  their prophet Muhamad. This King, for his great pride, and for not  being willing to obey the King of Portugal, had this town taken from  him by force, and in it they killed and captured many people, and  the King fled from the island, in which the King of Portugal ordered  a fortress to be built, and thus he holds under his command and  government those who continued to dwell there.      ISLAND OF MOMBAZA.    Passing Quiloa, and going along the coast of the said Arabia Felix  towards India, close to the mainland there is another island, in  which there is a city of the Moors, called Bombaza,[17] very large  and beautiful, and built of high and handsome houses of stone and  whitewash, and with very good streets, in the manner of those of  Quiloa. And it also had a king over it. The people are of dusky  white, and brown complexions, and likewise the women, who are much  adorned with silk and gold stuffs. It is a town of great trade in  goods, and has a good port, where there are always many ships, both  of those that sail for Sofala and those that come from Cambay and  Melinde, and others which sail to the islands of Zanzibar, Manfia,  and Penda, which will be spoken of further on. This Monbaza is a  country well supplied with plenty of provisions, very fine sheep,  which have round tails, and many cows, chickens, and very large  goats, much rice and millet, and plenty of oranges, sweet and  bitter, and lemons, cedrats, pomegranates, Indian figs, and all  sorts of vegetables, and very good water. The inhabitants at times  are at war with the people of the continent, and at other times at  peace, and trade with them, and obtain much honey and wax, and  ivory. This King, for his pride and unwillingness to obey the King  of Portugal, lost his city, and the Portuguese took it from him by  force, and the King fled, and they killed and made captives many of  his people, and the country was ravaged,[18] and much plunder was  carried off from it of gold and silver, copper, ivory, rich stuffs  of gold and silk, and much other valuable merchandize.      MELINDE.    After passing the city of Mombaza, at no great distance further on  along the coast, there is a very handsome town on the mainland on  the beach, called Melinde,[19] and it is a town of the Moors, which  has a king. And this town has fine houses of stone and whitewash, of  several stories, with their windows and terraces, and good streets.  The inhabitants are dusky and black, and go naked from the waist  upwards, and from that downwards they cover themselves with cloths  of cotton and silk, and others wear wraps like cloaks, and handsome  caps on their heads. The trade is great which they carry on in  cloth, gold, ivory, copper, quicksilver, and much other merchandise,  with both Moors and Gentiles of the kingdom of Cambay, who come to  their port with ships laden with cloth, which they buy in exchange  for"]]]
