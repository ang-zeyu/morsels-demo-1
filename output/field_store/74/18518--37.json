You'll have long  noses, too, after a year or so. There's an Auckland proverb, that a  new-chum never does any good until his nose has grown. You've got to  learn the truth of that pretty soon.\"    Following up these remarks, he proceeded to add--    \"It's like the proverbial cutting of the wisdom-teeth. After inhaling  this magnificent air of ours for a year or two, your nose will grow  bigger to receive it; and about the same time you will have spent the  money you brought with you, gone in for hard work, learnt common-sense,  and become 'colonized.'\"    The reader will understand that a new-chum is, throughout the colonies,  regarded as food for mirth. He is treated with good-humoured contempt  and kindly patronage. He is looked upon as a legitimate butt, and a sort  of grown-up and incapable infant. His doings are watched with interest,  to see what new eccentricities he will develop; and shouts of laughter  are raised at every fresh tale of some new-chum's inexperienced attempts  and failures. Half the stories that circulate in conversation have a  new-chum as the comic man of the piece; and if any unheard of  undertaking is noised about, \"Oh, he's a new-chum!\" is considered  sufficient explanation.    However, the new-chum is not supposed to be altogether a fool, since he  will sooner or later develop into the full-blown colonist, and since  sometimes it happens that one of his order will show colonists \"a thing  or two.\" He is one of the recognized characters of colonial society, and  as he affords much material that seems infinitely ludicrous to the older  colonist, so his faults and failings meet with lenient condonation.    Even the law seems to feel that the new-chum is scarcely a responsible  being. At the time I write of, drunkenness was severely legislated  against in New Zealand. A man who was merely drunk, without being  actually incapable or riotous, was liable, if any constable saw fit, to  be haled before the magistrate and fined one pound; and, on a subsequent  conviction, might be sent to the Stockade (prison), without the option  of a fine at all. The law stood something like that, and was impartially  administered by the Auckland Dogberry. However, if an individual were  pulled up, charged with even the most excessive tipsiness, including  riot, assault, incapability, or what not, and could show that he was a  new-chum, the sacred folly attributed to that state of being was held  sufficient to bear him blameless, and he was always discharged on his  promise not to do it again. I do not know whether this was intended as a  sort of indulgence to newly-arrived voyagers, or whether, in the eye of  the law, a new-chum was held to be an irresponsible being, who had not  yet arrived at the moral manhood of a New Zealander. Certain it is, it  was fact, and was largely taken advantage of, too.    In order to bear out one of the received theories regarding new-chums,  namely, their utter want of frugality, we, some half-a-dozen young  \"gentlemen,\" who have come out in the cabin, go to put up at one of the  leading hotels of the city. We have looked in at some of the minor  hotels and houses of accommodation, but are daunted by the rough, rude,  navvy-like men, who appear to chiefly frequent them; and we do not care  to go to any of the boarding-houses, where parsons, missionaries, and  people of that class mostly abound, and tincture the very air with a  savour of godliness and respectability that is, alas! repugnant to our  scapegrace youth.    We are young fellows with slender purses but boundless hopes, an immense  belief in ourselves and our golden prospects; but with the vaguest  possible idea of what manual labour, roughing it, and colonial work  really mean. Therefore, we have decided that there is no reason to  plunge at once into the middle of things, that we will look about a bit,  let ourselves down gently, and taste a little comfort before proceeding  further.    Our hotel is a solid, comfortable-looking edifice of stone, standing on  a wide street that traverses a high ridge, and commanding a fine view of  the harbour. It is well furnished throughout in English fashion,  resembling any first-class family and commercial hotel of the old  country. There is a long bar or saloon occupying the ground floor, with  a parlour behind it; there are also a spacious dining-room and  business-room. Upstairs there is a billiard-room, smoking-room, ladies'  drawing-room, and bedrooms capable of accommodating thirty or forty  guests. Behind the house is a large courtyard, round which are ranged  the bath-rooms, kitchens, offices, and stables; while further back is  the garden, principally used for strictly utilitarian purposes.    According to colonial custom there is little or no privacy, no private  sitting-rooms, and if a visitor have a bedroom to himself, it is not  quite such a sanctum as it would be in Britain. People stopping in the  house are free to permeate it from kitchen to attic, if so minded.    There are three common meals--breakfast, luncheon-dinner, and  dinner-supper--and any one who is not present at them, or who is hungry  between times, will have to go without in the interval, and wait till  the next regular meal-time comes round, unless he dare to invade the  kitchen and curry favour with the cook, or goes down to some restaurant  in the city.    Generally speaking, the table is furnished in a style most creditable as  to both quantity and quality of the viands. There may not be such a show  of plate and glass and ornament as there would be at a London hotel of  similar status, but there is a plenteous profusion of varied eatables,  fairly cooked and served up, to which profusion the home establishment  is an utter stranger. Fish, fowl, butcher's meat, vegetables, breads and  cakes, eggs, cream, and fruit, appear in such abundance that, when every  one is nearly gorged, we wonder what can possibly be done with the  overplus, especially since we are told that this is a city without  paupers, as yet.    Fresh from the crystallized decorum of English manners, we are  necessarily struck by the freedom of intercourse that prevails. Class  prejudices have certainly been imported here from Europe, and exist to a  small extent in Auckland society, but there is, withal, a nearer  approach to true liberty, equality, and fraternity, at any rate in the  manners and customs of colonists. The hotel servants show no symptoms of  servility, though in civility they are not lacking. Every one is  perfectly independent, and considers himself or herself on an equal  footing with every one else, no matter what differences may exist in  their present position--new-chums always excepted--while they ever bear  in mind that such differences are only temporary, and may disappear any  day in the chances and changes of life in a new country.    Our landlord and his wife preside at the meals, and, whoever may or  might be present, comport themselves as a host and hostess entertaining  a friendly party. In common with every one else, they take a lively  interest in our intentions and prospects, and we are bewildered with  conflicting advice and suggestions, some real and some jocular. They  make us feel at home in the house very speedily, and cause us to forget  that we are paying lodgers.    Not but what the bill will come up with due regularity, and will have to  be met as promptly. And the mention of it reminds me to state that the  tariff is eight shillings per day, inclusive of everything but liquors.  This would be moderate enough in all conscience, according to English  notions, but it is thought to be a luxurious price here. The minor  hotels and boarding-houses in Auckland charge from a pound to  thirty-five shillings per week. At present there is nothing higher than  the price we pay at our hotel.    Having hinted at the social relations that obtain here, there will seem  to be nothing outrageous in the following slight incident that  illustrates them. One morning, soon after our arrival, I get down to  breakfast rather late, after most of the guests have dispersed.  Something seems to have creased our landlady's temper, for she greets me  with--    \"Look here, young man! I can't have people walking in to breakfast at  all hours of the day. If you don't come down at the proper time, you'll  have to go without in future--mind that!\"    But at this juncture arrives the waiter, who is kind enough to favour me  with his friendship, bringing with him a dish he has been keeping hot,  and, as he slaps it down in front of me, he observes in a tone of mild  remonstrance--    \"Leave the man alone. I'll look after him. Now just you walk into that,  my boy, and see if it won't suit your complaint!\"    This is quite colonial style. But fancy an old-country landlady  venturing to remonstrate with her boarder in such terms; and imagine the  pitiable horror of a precise and formal Englishman, who might find  himself so addressed by a waiter, and in the presence of the latter's  mistress, too!    I am particular in styling Auckland a \"city,\" and not a \"town,\" for were  I to use the latter term I should expect to earn the undying hostility  of all true Aucklanders. It is a point they are excessively touchy upon,  and as the city and its suburbs contains a population of more than  twenty thousand--increasing annually at an almost alarming rate--it were  as well for me to be particular. We take a stroll or two about the city  in company with a colonial friend, who obligingly acts as our cicerone.    The wharf is naturally the first point of interest to new-comers. It  stretches continuously out into the river from the lower end of Queen  Street, and is over a quarter of a mile in length. It is built of wood,  and has several side-piers or \"tees,\" whereat ships discharge and take  in cargo. The scene is always a busy one;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29084"],[0,"The Cook and Housekeeper's Complete and Universal Dictionary; Including a System (#4)"],[1,"what is significantly termed 'the pride of life.'    The great point for comfort and respectability is, that all the  household economy should be uniform, not displaying a parade of show in  one thing, and a total want of comfort in another. Besides the  contemptible appearance that this must have to every person of good  sense, it is often productive of fatal consequences. How common it is,  in large towns especially, that for the vanity of having a showy  drawing-room to receive company, the family are confined to a close back  room, where they have scarcely air or light, the want of which is  essentially injurious to health. To keep rooms for show belongs to the  higher classes, where the house is sufficiently commodious for the  family, and to admit of this also: but in private dwellings, to shut up  perhaps the only room that is fit to live in, is to be guilty of a kind  of self-destruction; and yet how frequently this consideration escapes  persons who are disposed to render their family every comfort, but they  have a grate, a carpet, and chairs too fine for every day's use. What a  reflection, when nursing a sick child, to think that it may be the  victim of a bright grate, and a fine carpet! Or, what is equally  afflicting, to see all the children perhaps rickety and diseased from  the same cause! Keeping a spare bed for ornament, rather than for use,  is often attended with similar consequences. A stranger or a friend is  allowed to occupy it once in so many months, and he does it at the peril  of his health, and even of his life.    Another bad effect of keeping spare rooms is the seeing more company,  and in a more expensive manner, than is compatible with the general  convenience of the family, introducing with it an expense in dress, and  a dissipation of time, from which it suffers in various ways. Not the  least of these is the neglect of parental instruction, which it is  attempted to supply by sending the children at an improper age to  school; the girls where they had better never go, and the boys where  they get but little good, and perhaps are all the worse for mending.  Social intercourse is not improved by parade, but quite the contrary;  real friends, and the pleasantest kind of acquaintance, those who like  to be social, are repulsed by it. The failure therefore is general,  involving the loss of nearly all that is valuable in society, by an  abortive attempt to become fashionable.      _Setting out a Table._    The direction of a Table is no inconsiderable part of a lady's concern,  as it involves judgment in expenditure, respectability of appearance,  the comfort of her husband, and those who partake of their hospitality.  It is true that the mode of covering a table, and providing for the  guests, is merely a matter of taste, materially different in a variety  of instances; yet nothing can be more ruinous of real comfort than the  too common custom of making a profusion and a parade, unsuited not only  to the circumstances of the host, but to the number of the guests; or  more fatal to true hospitality than the multiplicity of dishes which  luxury has made fashionable at the tables of the great, the wealthy, and  the ostentatious, who are often neither great, nor wealthy, nor wise.  Such excessive preparation, instead of being a compliment to the party  invited, is nothing better than an indirect offence, conveying a tacit  insinuation that it is absolutely necessary to provide such delicacies  to bribe the depravity of their palates, when we desire the pleasure of  their company, and that society must be purchased on dishonourable terms  before it can be enjoyed. When twice as much cooking is undertaken as  there are servants, or conveniences in the kitchen to do it properly,  dishes must be dressed long before the dinner hour, and stand by  spoiling; and why prepare for eight or ten more than is sufficient for  twenty or thirty visitors? 'Enough is as good as a feast;' and a prudent  provider, avoiding what is extravagant and superfluous, may entertain  her friends three times as often, and ten times as well.    Perhaps there are few incidents in which the respectability of a man is  more immediately felt, than the style of dinner to which he may  accidentally bring home a visitor. And here, it is not the multiplicity  of articles, but the choice, the dressing, and the neat appearance of  the whole that is principally regarded. Every one is to live as he can  afford, and the meal of the tradesman ought not to emulate the  entertainments of the higher classes; but if two or three dishes are  well served, with the usual sauces, the table linen clean, the small  sideboard neatly laid, and all that is necessary be at hand, the  expectation of the husband and the friend will be gratified, because no  irregularity of domestic arrangement will disturb the social  intercourse. The same observation holds good on a larger scale. In all  situations of life the entertainment should be no less suited to the  station than to the fortune of the entertainer, and to the number and  rank of those invited.    The manner of Carving is not only a very necessary branch of  information, to enable a lady to do the honours of the table, but makes  a considerable difference in the consumption of a family; and though in  large parties she is so much assisted as to render this knowledge  apparently of less consequence, yet she must at times feel the  deficiency; and should not fail to acquaint herself with an attainment,  the advantage of which is evident every day. Some people haggle meat so  much, as not to be able to help half a dozen persons decently from a  large tongue, or a sirloin of beef; and the dish goes away with the  appearance of having been gnawed by dogs. Habit alone can make good  carvers; but some useful directions on this subject will be found in the  following pages, under the article Carving.    Half the trouble of waiting at table may be saved, by giving each guest  two plates, two knives and forks, two pieces of bread, a spoon, a wine  glass, and a tumbler; and by placing the wines and sauces in the centre  of the table, one visitor may help another. If the party is large, the  founders of the feast should sit about the middle of the table, instead  of at each end. They will then enjoy the pleasure of attending equally  to all their friends; and being in some degree relieved from the  occupation of carving, will have an opportunity of administering all  those little attentions which contribute so much to the comfort of their  guests. Dinner tables are seldom sufficiently lighted, or attended; an  active waiter will have enough to do to attend upon half a dozen  persons. There should be half as many candles as there are guests, and  their flame should not be more than eighteen inches above the table. The  modern candelabras answer no other purpose than that of giving an  appearance of pomp and magnificence, and seem intended to illuminate the  ceiling, rather than to shed light upon the plates.      _Quality of Provisions to be regarded._    The leading consideration about food ought always to be its  wholesomeness. Cookery may produce savoury and elegant looking dishes,  without their possessing any of the real qualities of food. It is at the  same time both a serious and a ludicrous reflection, that it should be  thought to do honour to our friends and to ourselves to set out a table  where indigestion with all its train of evils, such as fever,  rheumatism, gout, and the whole catalogue of human diseases, lie lurking  in almost every dish. Yet this is both done, and taken as a compliment.  The practice of flavouring custards, for example, with laurel leaves,  and adding fruit kernels to the poison of spirituous liquors, though far  too common, is attended with imminent danger: for let it be remembered,  that the flavour given by laurel essence is the most fatal kind of  poison. Children, and delicate grown-up persons, have often died  suddenly from this cause, even where the quantity of the deleterious  mixture was but small.    How infinitely preferable is a dinner of far less show, where nobody  need to be afraid of what they are eating; and such a one will always be  genteel and respectable. If a person can give his friend only a leg of  mutton, there is nothing of which to be ashamed, provided it is good and  well dressed. Nothing can be of greater importance to the mistress of a  family, than the preservation of its health; but there is no way of  securing this desirable object with any degree of certainty, except her  eye watches over every part of the culinary process. The subject of  cookery is too generally neglected by mistresses, as something beneath  their notice; or if engaged in, it is to contrive a variety of  mischievous compositions, both savoury and sweet, to recommend their own  ingenuity. Yet it is quite evident that every good housewife ought to be  well acquainted with this important branch of domestic management, and  to take upon herself at least its entire direction and controul. This is  a duty which her husband, children, and domestics, have a right to  expect at her hands; and which a solicitude for their health and comfort  will induce her to discharge with fidelity. If cookery has been worth  studying as a sensual gratification, it is much more so as the means of  securing the greatest of human blessings.    A house fitted up with clean good furniture, the kitchen provided with  clean wholesome-looking cooking utensils, good fires, in grates that  give no anxiety lest a good fire should spoil them, clean good  table-linen, the furniture of the table and sideboard good of the kind  without ostentation, and a well-dressed plain dinner, bespeak a sound  judgment and correct taste in a private family, that place it on a  footing of respectability with the first characters in the country. It  is only conforming to our sphere, not vainly attempting"]]]
