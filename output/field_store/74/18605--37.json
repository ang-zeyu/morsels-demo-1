In _G. olivacea_ in Kansas, time of  breeding is controlled by the distribution of heavy rainfall creating  favorable conditions. Onset of the breeding season may be hastened or  delayed, or an entire year may be missed because of summer drought. If  favorable heavy rains are well distributed throughout the summer, frogs  of age classes that are not yet sexually mature in the early part of  the breeding season, may comprise the bulk of the breeding population in  late summer.      DEVELOPMENT OF EGGS AND LARVAE    Eggs laid on June 5 by the pair kept in the laboratory were hatching on  June 7, on the average approximately 48 hours from the time of laying.  By June 8 all the eggs had hatched and the tadpoles were active. On  August 28 and 29 thousands of newly metamorphosed young were in evidence  on wet soil at the pond margin; in some the head still was tadpolelike  and they had a vestige of the tail stump. These young were remarkably  uniform in size, 15 to 16 mm. (the smallest one found was 14-1/2 mm.)  and almost all of them had originated from eggs laid after heavy  precipitation, totalling 3.22 inches, in the first 36 hours of August.  Allowing one day for adults to reach the pond and spawn, and two days  more for eggs to hatch, the tadpole stage must have lasted approximately  24 days in this crop of young.    Wright and Wright (1949: 582) stated that the tadpoles metamorphosed  after 30 to 50 days, and that the newly metamorphosed frogs are 10 to 12  mm. in length. Length of time required for larval development probably  varies a great deal depending on the interaction of several factors such  as temperature and food supply.      GROWTH    Little has been recorded concerning the growth rate of _Gastrophryne_ or  the time required for it to attain sexual maturity. Wright (1932) found  that _G. carolinensis_ in the Okefinokee Swamp region has a mean  metamorphosing-size of 10.8 mm. Young thought to be those recently  emerged from their first hibernation were those in the size group 15.0  to 20.0 mm., while the frogs in the 20 to 27 mm. size class and those in  the 27 to 36 mm. class were interpreted as representing two successively  older annual age classes. Anderson (1954: 41) thought he could recognize  four successive annual age classes in the same species in southern  Louisiana. He found that sexual maturity is attained at a length of 21  to 24 mm. in frogs which he believed to be late in the second year of  life.    Allowing for size differences between the two species, Wright's and  Anderson's conclusions regarding growth in _G. carolinensis_, on the  basis of size groups, are largely substantiated by my own data on the  growth of marked individuals of _G. olivacea_ living under natural  conditions in Kansas.    In 1954, an opportunity to investigate the early growth was afforded by  unusually favorable circumstances. The population of frogs that emerged  from hibernation in the late spring of 1954 included few, if any, that  were below adult size; drought had prevented successful breeding in 1952  and 1953. Heavy rains in the first week of June, 1954, and again in the  first week of August, resulted in the production of two successive crops  of young so widely spaced that they were easily distinguishable. Some  young may have been hatched after other minor rains, but certainly these  were relatively few. Young from the eggs laid in the first week of  August were metamorphosing during the last week of August. Growth in the  frogs of this group can be shown by the average size and the size range  of the successive samples collected.    TABLE 2. GROWTH IN FROGS METAMORPHOSED IN THE LAST WEEK OF AUGUST, 1954.      ===========================================================                        |Number in|   Mean size    |Size range     Time of sample     | sample  |     in mm.     |  in mm.    --------------------+---------+----------------+-----------    August 27 to 31     |   27    | 15.55 +/- .079 | 15 to 17    --------------------+---------+----------------+-----------    September 11        |  114    | 17.2  +/- .033 | 14 to 20    --------------------+---------+----------------+-----------    September 15 to 22  |   12    | 18.7  +/- .090 | 16 to 20    --------------------+---------+----------------+-----------    September 27 to 30  |   37    | 19.3  +/- .055 | 17 to 21.5    --------------------+---------+----------------+-----------    October 1 to 7      |   62    | 20.8  +/- .072 | 17 to 24    --------------------+---------+----------------+-----------    October 12 to 17    |   49    | 22.3  +/- .092 | 18 to 24    ===========================================================    By mid-October, six weeks after metamorphosis, these frogs had increased  in over-all length by approximately 50 percent. Having grown a little  more than 1 mm. per week on the average, they were approximately  intermediate in size between small adults and newly metamorphosed young.    The frogs hatched in June were present in relatively small numbers  compared with those hatched in August, and were not observed  metamorphosing. In late August a sample of 33 judged to belong to the  June brood averaged 26.2 (22-28) mm. long. A sample of 39 from the first  week of October averaged 28.1 (24.5-32) mm. Frogs of this group thus  were approaching small adult size late in their first growing season.  Such individuals possibly breed in the summer following their first  hibernation, when they are a year old or a little more. Because  recaptured frogs were not sacrificed to determine the state of their  gonads, the minimum time required to attain sexual maturity was not  definitely determined. The available evidence indicates that sexual  maturity is most often attained late in the second year of life, at an  age of approximately two years. The darkened and distensible throat  pouch of the adult male probably is the best available indicator of  sexual maturity.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Growth shown by successive samples of young  ant-eating frogs of two size groups in late summer and early fall of  1954. For each sample the mean, standard deviation, and range are shown.  Lower series are those metamorphosed in late August, and upper series  are those metamorphosed in late June.]    [Illustration: FIG. 4. Rapid growth of a young female caught in June,  July, and August, 1949. Presumably this individual metamorphosed late in  the summer of 1948, and at the age of approximately one year it was near  small adult size.]    Frogs that metamorphose in late summer have little time to grow before  hibernating, and still are small when they emerge in spring. The  smallest one found was 19 mm. long (May 19, 1951), and in each year  except 1954 many such young were found that were less than 25 mm. in  length in May or early June. None of the frogs marked at or near  metamorphosing size has been recaptured, but the trend of early growth  is well shown by Table 2 and Fig. 3. However, many juveniles that were  captured and marked within a few weeks of metamorphosis were recaptured  as adults. The selected individuals in Table 3 are considered typical of  growth from \"half-grown\" to small adult size. Growth in many other  individuals is shown in Figs. 6 and 7.    TABLE 3.

Ant-eating frogs, a little less than twice  natural size, adult and newly metamorphosed young, showing differences  in size and coloration. The young is darker and has a leaflike middorsal  mark which fades as growth proceeds.]    The trend of growth after attainment of minimum adult size is also well  shown by the records of marked individuals recaptured. Many of these  were marked while they were still small so that their approximate ages  are known. For those recaptured in their second year, after one  hibernation, length averaged 30.92 mm. Some of this group were young  metamorphosed late the preceding summer and still far short of adult  size (as small as 23 mm.) when recaptured. Others were relatively large,  up to 33 mm. A group of 22 recaptured frogs known to be in their third  year averaged 33.3 mm. (males 31.9, females 35.3, excluding four  individuals of undetermined sex). Fifteen other recaptured frogs were  known to be in their fourth year at least, and some probably were older,  as they were already large adults when first examined. These 15 averaged  36.6 mm. (males 34.7, females 37.9 mm.). Size was similar in a sample of  58 individuals intercepted en route to the breeding pond in heavy rains  of June and August, 1954. The 38 males in this sample ranged in size  from 30 mm. to 38 mm., averaging 34.5. The 20 females ranged from 34 mm.  to 40 mm., averaging 37.65.

From the day we leave here and hand over everything to the receiver  of the bank we shall be drawing on our little capital, and every pound  is of importance. I think, therefore, Alfred, that you and I should make  up our minds before we leave here as to what course we are going to  adopt. As I have said, I myself see no scheme by which we are likely to  be able to maintain ourselves in England, even in a very humble way. A  life in the colonies would, to me, be very much more pleasant than the  struggle to make ends meet here.    \"It would afford an opening for Wilfrid, and be vastly more advantageous  for him than anything we should hope to get for him here; and I think it  will be far better for Marion too. Of course, if we decided to emigrate,  we could, should you prefer it, go to Canada, Australia, or the United  States in preference to New Zealand. I only incline to New Zealand  because I have heard that there is a larger proportion of officers and  gentlemen there than in other colonies, and because I believe that the  climate is a particularly pleasant one. But, of course, this is merely a  suggestion at present, and it is for you to decide.\"    \"If we are to emigrate at all,\" Mr. Renshaw replied, \"I should certainly  prefer New Zealand myself. The Maoris are a most interesting people.  Their origin is a matter of doubt, their customs and religion are  peculiar, and I have no doubt that I should, after studying them, be  able to throw much new and valuable light upon the subject. Personally,  I am sure that I am in no way fitted for the life of a settler. I know  nothing of farming, and could neither drive a plough nor wield an axe;  but if I could make the native subject my own, I might probably be able  to do my share towards our expenses by my books, while Wilfrid could  look after the men. The offer of these two young fellows to go with us  has removed several of my objections to the plan, and I agree with you  that it would be more advantageous for Wilfrid and Marion than to be  living in wretched lodgings. Therefore, my dear, I have decided to fall  in with your plan, and only hope that it will turn out as well as you  seem to expect. It will be a great change and a great trial; but since  you seem to have set your heart upon it, I am willing to adopt your  plans instead of my own, and we will therefore consider it settled that  we will go to New Zealand.\"    Mrs. Renshaw was too wise a woman to point out that her husband had not,  so far as she was aware, any plans whatever of his own, and she  contented herself by saying quietly: \"I am glad you have decided so, my  dear. I do think it is the best thing for us all, and I am quite sure it  is the best for Wilfrid and Marion. If it had not been for them I should  have said let us take a tiny cottage near some town where I might add to  our income by giving lessons in music or other things, and you might  have the companionship of people of your own tastes; but, being as it  is, I think it far better to give them a start in a new country,  although I know that such a life as we shall lead there must entail, at  any rate at first, some hardships, and the loss of much to which we have  been accustomed.\"    Wilfrid and Marion were delighted when they heard from their mother that  the matter was settled. Both had had great hopes that Wilfrid's scheme  would be finally accepted, as there did not seem any other plan that was  possible. Still Wilfrid knew the difficulty that his father would have  in making up his mind, and feared there might be a long delay before he  could bring himself to accept the plan proposed to him. Mrs. Renshaw,  who was a good business woman, lost no time in arranging with Robert and  William Grimstone as to their accompanying them. Their passage-money was  to be paid, and they were to bind themselves to remain for three years  in Mr. Renshaw's service on wages similar to those they would have  obtained at home; after that, they were to be paid whatever might be the  colonial rate of wages.    The excitement that the prospect of emigration caused to the young  people lessened their pain at leaving the house where they had been born  and brought up, with all its pleasant associations and material  comforts. It was, however, very trying to them when they bade good-bye  for the last time to their surroundings and shook hands with their old  servants.    \"If ever we get rich in New Zealand, father,\" Wilfrid said, \"we will  come back and buy the house again.\"    Mr. Renshaw shook his head. Just at present he was disposed to regard  himself as a martyr, and considered that he had made an unprecedented  sacrifice of his own wishes and comforts for the sake of his children,  and that no good could be expected to arise from the plan to which he  had consented. A good many friends had gathered at the station to say  good-bye, and it was some time after the train had started on its way to  London before any of the party felt themselves inclined to speak.    On arriving in town they went at once to lodgings they had engaged in  Eastbourne Terrace, facing the station. Once settled there, no time was  lost in making preparations for their voyage. The files of the  advertisements had already been searched and the names of the vessels  sailing for New Zealand and the addresses of their owners noted, and  after paying a visit to several shipping offices the choice of vessels  remained at last between the _Flying Scud_ and the _Mayflower_. They  were vessels of about the same size, both bore a good reputation as  sailers, and they heard excellent accounts of the captains who commanded  them.    The _Mayflower_ was to sail direct to Wellington round the Cape. The  _Flying Scud_ was taking in cargo for Rio and Buenos-Ayres, and would  proceed thence via Cape Horn. Her rates of passage were somewhat lower  than those of the _Mayflower_, as the route via the Cape of Good Hope  was that more generally used, and the number of passengers who had  secured berths by her were very much smaller than those who intended to  travel by the _Mayflower_. It was this that principally decided them in  choosing the western route; Mr. Renshaw was in a depressed and nervous  state, and his wife considered that he would be far more comfortable  with a comparatively small number of fellow-passengers than in a crowded  ship.    Marion quite agreed with her mother; and Wilfrid was also in favour of  the _Flying Scud_, as he thought it would be pleasant to break the  passage by putting into the great South American ports and getting a  glimpse of their inhabitants. Mr. Renshaw himself was quite satisfied to  accept his wife's decision, whatever it might be. The _Flying Scud_ was  therefore selected, and passages for the party secured in her.          CHAPTER II.    THE EMBARKATION.      The _Flying Scud_ was to sail in ten days; and this was ample time for  their preparations, for Mrs. Renshaw wisely decided that it was better  to buy all that was requisite for starting their new life, in New  Zealand.    \"We have none of us the least idea what will be required,\" she said. \"It  will be far better to pay somewhat higher prices for what we really do  want out there than to cumber ourselves with all sorts of things that  may be useless to us. We have already a considerable amount of baggage.  There are our clothes, linen, and books, your father's two  double-barrelled guns, which, by the way, I do not think he has ever  used since we have been married. The only thing we had better get, as  far as I see, will be four rifles, which no doubt we can buy cheap  second-hand, and four revolvers.    \"I do not for a moment suppose we shall ever want to use them, but as we  may be often left in the house alone I think it would be pleasant to  know that we are not altogether defenceless. We had better lay in a good  stock of ammunition for all these weapons. Besides the clothes we have  we had better get serge dresses and suits for the voyage, and a few  strong servicable gowns and suits for rough work out there. Beyond this  I do not think that we need spend a penny. We can certainly get  everything we shall want for our new life at Wellington, which is a  large place.\"    On the morning of the day on which they were to embark the Grimstones  came up from Reading. All the heavy luggage had been sent on board ship  on the previous day, and at twelve o'clock two cabs drove up to the side  of the _Flying Scud_ in St. Catherine's Docks. The one contained Mr. and  Mrs. Renshaw, Marion, and a vast quantity of small packets inside.  Wilfrid was on the box with the driver, and the roof was piled high with  luggage. The other cab contained the two Grimstones and the rest of the  luggage. The Renshaws were already acquainted with the ship in which  they were to sail, having paid her a visit four days previously to see  their cabins. The parents had a comfortable cabin to themselves. Marion  was berthed in a cabin with two other ladies, who, she learned, were  sisters, the elder about her own age, and Wilfrid found he would have  but one fellow-passenger. The Grimstones were in the steerage forward.    The vessel was in a state of bustle, and what to the travellers seemed  confusion. Numbers of other passengers were arriving, and the deck was  littered with, their luggage until it could be sorted and sent down to  their cabins; late cargo was being swung on board and lowered into the  hold. On the deck aft were gathered the cabin passengers, with relatives  and friends who had come to see them off. An hour later the bell rang as  a signal for all visitors to go ashore. There were sad partings both  fore and aft as the bell clanged out its impatient signal.    \"I am very glad, mother, that we have no friends to say good-bye to us  here, and that we got that all over at Reading.\"    \"So am I, Wil. I think it much better myself that these partings should  be got through before"]]]
