If the crack proceeds very irregularly, and especially if it tends to  extend along the tube, the glass has been badly annealed, and should not  be employed for glass-blowing purposes. It is important that the point  of hot glass used shall be very small, however. Even good glass will  frequently give an irregular fracture if touched with a large mass of  molten glass.    Finally, glass tube which is thin and of small diameter should not  crack when suddenly brought into a flame. But larger and thicker tubes  will not often withstand this treatment. They should not crack, however,  when they are brought into a flame gradually, after having been held in  the warm air in front of it for a minute or so.    Good glass does not readily devitrify when held in the blow-pipe flame.  As devitrified glass very often may be restored to its vitreous  condition by fusion, devitrification most frequently shows itself round  the edges of the heated parts, and may be recognised by the production  of a certain degree of roughness there. It is believed to be due to the  separation of certain silicates in the crystallised form. Hard glass,  which contains much calcium, is more apt to devitrify than the more  fusible varieties.[3]    [3] The presence of silicates of calcium and aluminum are considered to  promote a tendency to devitrification in glass; and glasses of complex  composition are more apt to devitrify than the simpler varieties. See  _Glass-making_, by Powell, Chance, and Harris, Chap. IV.    Glass tubes are made of various sizes. When purchasing a supply, it is  necessary to be somewhat precise in indicating to the vendor the sizes  required. I have therefore placed at the end of the book, in an  appendix, a table of numbered diagrams. In ordering tubes it will  usually only be necessary to give the numbers of the sizes wished for,  and to specify the quantity of each size required. In ordering glass  tubes by weight, it must be remembered that a great many lengths of the  smaller sizes, but very few lengths of the larger sizes, go to the  pound. Larger-sized tubes than those on the diagram are also made. In  ordering them the external diameter and thickness of glass preferred  should be stated.      =Cleaning and Preparing a Tube.=--It is frequently much easier to clean  the tube from which a piece of apparatus is to be made than to clean  the finished apparatus. A simple method of cleaning a tube is to draw a  piece of wet rag which has been tied to a string through the tube once  or twice, or, with small tubes, to push a bit of wet paper or cotton  wool through them. If the dirt cannot be removed in this way, the  interior of the tube should be moistened with a little sulphuric acid in  which some bichromate of potassium has been dissolved. In any case, it  must finally be repeatedly rinsed with distilled water, and dried by  cautiously warming it, and sucking or blowing air through it. In order  to avoid heating delicate apparatus which has become damp and needs  drying, the water may be washed out with a few drops of spirit, which is  readily removed at a low temperature.    Before using a glass tube for an operation in which it will be necessary  to blow into it, one end of it must be contracted, unless it is already  of such a size that it can be held between the lips with perfect ease;  in any case, its edges must be rounded. For descriptions of these  operations, see page 35. The other end must be closed. This may be done  by means of a cork.      =Presenting Glass to the Flame.=--Glass tubes must never be brought  suddenly into the flame in which they are to be heated. All glass is  very likely to crack if so treated. It should in all cases be held for a  little while in front of the flame, rotated constantly in the hot air  and moved about, in order that it may be warmed over a considerable  area. When it has become pretty hot by this treatment, it may be  gradually brought nearer to the flame, and, finally, into contact with  it, still with constant rotation and movement, so as to warm a  considerable part of the tube. When the glass has been brought fairly  into contact with the flame, it will be safe to apply the heat at the  required part only. Care must be taken in these preliminary operations  to avoid heating the more fusible glasses sufficiently to soften them.      =Methods of working with Lead and soft Soda Glass respectively.=--When  lead glass is heated in the brush flame of the ordinary Herapath  blow-pipe, or within the point of the pointed flame, it becomes  blackened on its surface, in consequence of a portion of the lead  becoming reduced to the metallic state by the reducing gases in the  flame. The same thing will happen in bending a lead glass tube if it is  made too hot in a luminous flame. A practical acquaintance with this  phenomenon may be acquired by the following experiment:--    Take a piece of lead glass tube, bring it gradually from the point of a  pointed flame to a position well within the flame, and observe what  happens. When the glass reaches the point _A_ (Fig. 3), or thereabouts,  a dark red spot will develop on the glass, the area of the spot will  increase as the glass is brought further in the direction _A_ to _B_. If  the glass be then removed from the flame and examined, it will be found  that a dark metallic stain covers the area of the dark red spot  previously observed. Repeat the experiment, but at the first appearance  of the dark spot slowly move the glass in the direction _A_ to _C_. The  spot will disappear, and, if the operation be properly performed, in its  place there will be a characteristically greenish-yellow luminous spot  of highly heated glass. In this proceeding the reduced lead of the dark  spot has been re-oxidised on passing into the hot gases, rich in oxygen,  which abound at the point of the flame. If one end of the tube has been  previously closed by a piece of cork, and if air be forced into the tube  with the mouth from the open end before the luminous spot has become  cool, the glass will expand. If the experiment be repeated several  times, with pointed flames of various sizes, the operator will quickly  learn how to apply the pointed flame to lead glass so that it may be  heated without becoming stained with reduced lead.    If the spot of reduced metal produced in the first experiment be next  brought into the oxidising flame, it also may gradually be removed. On  occasion, therefore, apparatus which has become stained with lead during  its production, may be rendered presentable by suitable treatment in the  oxidising flame. The process of re-oxidising a considerable surface in  this way after it has cooled down is apt to be very tedious, however,  and, especially in the case of thin tubes or bulbs, often is not  practicable. In working with lead glass, therefore, any reduction that  occurs should be removed by transferring the glass to the oxidising  flame at once.    Small tubes, and small areas on larger tubes of English glass, may be  softened without reduction by means of the pointed oxidising flame; but  it is not easy to heat any considerable area of glass sufficiently with  a pointed flame. And though it is possible, with care, to employ the hot  space immediately in front of the visible end of an ordinary brush  flame, which is rich in air, yet, in practice, it will not be found  convenient to heat large masses of lead glass nor tubes of large size,  to a sufficiently high temperature to get the glass into good condition  for blowing, by presenting them to the common brush flame.    It may seem that as glass which has become stained with reduced lead can  be subsequently re-oxidised by heating it with the tip of the pointed  flame, the difficulty might be overcome by heating it for working in the  brush flame, and subsequently oxidising the reduced lead. It is,  however, difficult, as previously stated, to re-oxidise a large surface  of glass which has been seriously reduced by the action of the reducing  gases of the flame, after it has cooled. Moreover, there is this very  serious objection, that if, as may be necessary, the action of the  reducing flame be prolonged, the extensive reduction that takes place  diminishes the tendency of the glass to acquire the proper degree of  viscosity for working it, the glass becomes difficult to expand by  blowing, seriously roughened on its surface, and often assumes a very  brittle or rotten condition.    When it is only required to bend or draw out tubes of lead glass, they  may be softened sufficiently by a smoky flame, which, probably owing to  its having a comparatively low temperature, does not so readily reduce  the lead as flames of higher temperature. But for making joints,  collecting masses of glass for making bulbs, and in all cases where it  is required that the glass shall be thoroughly softened, the smoky flame  does not give good results.    In the glass-works, where large quantities of ornamental and other glass  goods are made of lead or flint glass, the pots in which the glass is  melted are so constructed that the gases of the furnace do not come into  contact with the glass;[4] and as the intensely-heated sides of the  melting-pot maintain a very high temperature within it by radiation, the  workman has a very convenient source of heat to his hand,--he has, in  fact, only to introduce the object, or that part of it which is to be  softened, into the mouth of the melting-pot, and it is quickly heated  sufficiently for his purpose, not only without contact of reducing  gases, but in air. He can therefore easily work upon very large masses  of glass. In a special case, such a source of heat might be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33965"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 4, July, 1851 (#4)"],[1," anxious expectation,       the villagers await the result. And now, as evening closes,       a shrill wild cry, pealing from afar, over the darkening       forest, proclaims the return of the victorious warriors. The       village is alive with sudden commotion; and snatching sticks       and stones, knives and hatchets, men, women, and children,       yelling like fiends let loose, swarm out of the narrow       portal, to visit upon the miserable captives a foretaste of       the deadlier torments in store for them. And now, the black       arches of the forest glow with the fires of death; and with       brandished torch and firebrand the frenzied multitude close       around their victim. The pen shrinks to write, the heart       sickens to conceive, the fierceness of his agony; yet still,       amid the din of his tormentors, rises his clear voice of       scorn and defiance. The work is done; the blackened trunk is       flung to the dogs, and, with clamorous shouts and hootings,       the murderers seek to drive away the spirit of their victim.         \"The Iroquois reckoned these barbarities among their most       exquisite enjoyments; and yet they had other sources of       pleasure, which made up in frequency and in innocence all       that they lacked in intensity. Each passing season had its       feasts and dances, often mingling religion with social       pastime. The young had their frolics and merry-makings; and       the old had their no less frequent councils, where       conversation and laughter alternated with grave       deliberations for the public weal. There were also stated       periods marked by the recurrence of momentous ceremonies, in       which the whole community took part--the mystic sacrifice of       the dogs, the wild orgies of the dream feast, and the       loathsome festival of the exhumation of the dead. Yet, in       the intervals of war and hunting, these multiform       occupations would often fail; and, while the women were       toiling in the cornfields, the lazy warriors vainly sought       relief from the scanty resources of their own minds, and       beguiled the hours with smoking or sleeping, with gambling       or gallantry.\"    A glimpse of Indian winter life:         \"But when winter descends upon the north, sealing up the       fountains, fettering the streams, and turning the       green-robed forests to shivering nakedness, then, bearing       their frail dwellings on their backs, the Ojibwa family       wander forth into the wilderness, cheered only, on their       dreary track, by the whistling of the north wind, and the       hungry howl of wolves. By the banks of some frozen stream,       women and children, men and dogs, lie crouched together       around the fire. They spread their benumbed fingers over the       embers, while the wind shrieks through the fir-trees like       the gale through the rigging of a frigate, and the narrow       concave of the wigwam sparkles with the frostwork of their       congealed breath. In vain they beat the magic drum, and call       upon their guardian manitoes;--the wary moose keeps aloof,       the bear lies close in his hollow tree, and famine stares       them in the face. And now the hunter can fight no more       against the nipping cold and blinding sleet. Stiff and       stark, with haggard cheek and shrivelled lip, he lies among       the snow drifts; till, with tooth and claw, the famished       wildcat strives in vain to pierce the frigid marble of his       limbs. Such grim schooling is thrown away on the       incorrigible mind of the northern Algonquin. He lives in       misery, as his fathers lived before him. Still, in the brief       hour of plenty he forgets the season of want; and still the       sleet and the snow descend upon his houseless head.\"    Here another leaf from Penn's laurels:         \"It required no great benevolence to urge the Quakers to       deal kindly with their savage neighbors. They were bound in       common sense to propitiate them; since, by incurring their       resentment, they would involve themselves in the dilemma of       submitting their necks to the tomahawk, or wielding the       carnal weapon, in glaring defiance of their pacific       principles. In paying the Indians for the lands which his       colonists occupied,--a piece of justice which has been       greeted with a general clamor of applause,--Penn, as he       himself confesses, acted on the prudent counsel of Compton,       Bishop of London. Nor is there any truth in the       representations of Raynal and other eulogists of the Quaker       legislator, who hold him up to the world as the only       European who ever acquired the Indian lands by purchase,       instead of seizing them by fraud or violence. The example of       purchase had been set fifty years before by the Puritans of       New England; and several of the other colonies had more       recently pursued the same just and prudent course.\"    The deaths of Wolfe and Montcalm:         \"In the heat of the action, as he advanced at the head of       the grenadiers of Louisburg, a bullet shattered his wrist;       but he wrapped his handkerchief about the wound, and showed       no sign of pain. A moment more, and a ball pierced his side.       Still he pressed forward, waving his sword, and cheering his       soldiers to the attack, when a third shot lodged deep within       his breast. He paused, reeled, and, staggering to one side,       fell to the earth. Brown, a lieutenant of the grenadiers,       Henderson, a volunteer, an officer of artillery, and a       private soldier raised him together in their arms, and,       bearing him to the rear, laid him softly on the grass. They       asked if he would have a surgeon; but he shook his head, and       answered that all was over with him. His eyes closed with       the torpor of approaching death, and those around sustained       his fainting form. Yet they could not withhold their gaze       from the wild turmoil before them, and the charging ranks of       their companions rushing through fire and smoke.\" \"See how       they run,\" one of the officers exclaimed, as the French fled       in confusion before the levelled bayonets. \"Who run?\"       demanded Wolfe, opening his eyes like a man aroused from       sleep. \"The enemy, sir,\" was the reply; \"they give way every       where.\" \"Then,\" said the dying general, \"tell Colonel Burton       to march Webb's regiment down to Charles River, to cut off       their retreat from the bridge. Now, God be praised, I will       die in peace,\" he murmured; and, turning on his side, he       calmly breathed his last!         \"Almost at the same moment fell his great adversary,       Montcalm, as he strove, with useless bravery, to rally his       shattered ranks. Struck down with a mortal wound, he was       placed upon a litter and borne to the General Hospital on       the banks of the St. Charles. The surgeons told him that he       could not recover. \"I am glad of it,\" was his calm reply. He       then asked how long he might survive, and was told that he       had not many hours remaining. \"So much the better,\" he said;       \"I am happy that I shall not live to see the surrender of       Quebec.\" Officers from the garrison came to his bedside to       ask his orders and instructions. \"I will give no more       orders,\" replied the defeated soldier; \"I have much business       that must be attended to, of greater moment than your ruined       garrison and this wretched country. My time is very short;       therefore, pray leave me.\" The officers withdrew, and none       remained in the chamber but his confessor and the Bishop of       Quebec. To the last, he expressed his contempt for his own       mutinous and half-famished troops, and his admiration for       the disciplined valor of his opponents. He died before       midnight, and was buried at his own desire in a cavity of       the earth formed by the bursting of a bombshell.\"    We conclude with a sketch of Pontiac:         \"Pontiac, as already mentioned, was principal chief of the       Ottawas. The Ottawas, Ojibwas, and Pottawattamies, had long       been united in a loose kind of confederacy, of which he was       the virtual head. Over those around him his authority was       almost despotic, and his power extended far beyond the       limits of the three united tribes. His influence was great       among all the nations of the Illinois country; while, from       the sources of the Ohio to those of the Mississippi, and,       indeed, to the farthest boundaries of the wide-spread       Algonquin race, his name was known and respected. The fact       that Pontiac was born the son of a chief would in no degree       account for the extent of his power; for, among Indians,       many a chief's son sinks back into insignificance, while the       offspring of a common warrior may succeed to his place.       Among all the wild tribes of the continent, personal merit       is indispensable to gaining or preserving dignity. Courage,       resolution, wisdom, address and eloquence, are sure       passports to distinction. With all these Pontiac was       preeminently endowed, and it was chiefly to them, urged to       their highest activity by a vehement ambition, that he owed       his greatness. His intellect was strong and capacious. He       possessed commanding energy and force of mind, and in       subtlety and craft could match the best of his wily race.       But, though capable of acts of lofty magnanimity, he was a       thorough savage, with a wider range of intellect than those       around him, but sharing all their passions and prejudices,       their fierceness and treachery.\"          DR.
