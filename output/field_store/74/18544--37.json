It was out of such a sound business life that  were produced in Revolutionary times such characters as Robert Morris  and after the Revolution men like Stephen Girard.    Pennsylvania in colonial times was ruled from Philadelphia somewhat as  France has always been ruled from Paris. And yet there was a difference:  Pennsylvania had free government. The Germans and the Scotch-Irish  outnumbered the Quakers and could have controlled the Legislature,  for in 1750 out of a population of 150,000 the Quakers were only about  50,000; and yet the Legislature down to the Revolution was always  confided to the competent hands of the Quakers. No higher tribute,  indeed, has ever been paid to any group of people as governors of a  commonwealth and architects of its finance and trade.    It is a curious commentary on the times and on human nature that these  Quaker folk, treated as outcasts and enemies of good order and religion  in England and gradually losing all their property in heavy fines and  confiscations, should so suddenly in the wilderness prove the capacity  of their \"Holy Experiment\" for achieving the best sort of good order and  material success. They immediately built a most charming little town  by the waterside, snug and pretty with its red brick houses in the best  architectural style. It was essentially a commercial town down to the  time of the Revolution and long afterwards. The principal residences  were on Water Street, the second street from the wharves. The town in  those days extended back only as far as Fourth Street, and the State  House, now Independence Hall, an admirable instance of the local brick  architecture, stood on the edge of the town. The Pennsylvania Hospital,  the first institution of its kind to be built in America, was situated  out in the fields.    Through the town ran a stream following the line of the present Dock  Street. Its mouth had been a natural landing place for the first  explorers and for the Indians from time immemorial. Here stood a neat  tavern, the Blue Anchor, with its dovecotes in old English style,  looking out for many a year over the river with its fleet of small  boats. Along the wharves lay the very solid, broad, somber, Quaker-like  brick warehouses, some of which have survived into modern times.  Everywhere were to be found ships and the good seafaring smell of tar  and hemp. Ships were built and fitted out alongside docks where other  ships were lading. A privateer would receive her equipment of guns,  pistols, and cutlasses on one side of a wharf, while on the other side  a ship was peacefully loading wheat or salted provisions for the West  Indies.    Everybody's attention in those days was centered on the water instead of  inland on railroads as it is today. Commerce was the source of wealth of  the town as agriculture was the wealth of the interior of the province.  Every one lived close to the river and had an interest in the rise and  fall of the tide. The little town extended for a mile along the water  but scarcely half a mile back from it. All communication with other  places, all news from the world of Europe came from the ships, whose  captains brought the letters and the few newspapers which reached  the colonists. An important ship on her arrival often fired a gun and  dropped anchor with some ceremony. Immediately the shore boats swarmed  to her side; the captain was besieged for news and usually brought the  letters ashore to be distributed at the coffeehouse. This institution  took the place of the modern stock exchange, clearing house, newspaper,  university, club, and theater all under one roof, with plenty to eat and  drink besides. Within its rooms vessels and cargoes were sold; before  its door negro slaves were auctioned off; and around it as a  common center were brought together all sorts of business, valuable  information, gossip, and scandal. It must have been a brilliant scene  in the evening, with the candles lighting embroidered red and yellow  waistcoats, blue and scarlet Coats, green and black velvet, with the  rich drab and mouse color of the prosperous Quakers contrasting with the  uniforms of British officers come to fight the French and Indian wars.  Sound, as well as color, had its place in this busy and happy colonial  life. Christ Church, a brick building which still stands the perfection  of colonial architecture had been established by the Church of England  people defiantly in the midst of heretical Quakerdom. It soon possessed  a chime of bells sent out from England. Captain Budden, who brought them  in his ship Myrtilla, would charge no freight for so charitable a deed,  and in consequence of his generosity every time he and his ship appeared  in the harbor the bells were rung in his honor. They were rung on market  days to please the farmers who came into town with their wagons loaded  with poultry and vegetables. They were rung muffled in times of public  disaster and were kept busy in that way in the French and Indian wars.  They were also rung muffled for Franklin when it was learned that while  in London he had favored the Stamp Act--a means of expressing popular  opinion which the newspapers subsequently put out of date.    The severe Quaker code of conduct and peaceful contemplation contains no  prohibition against good eating and drinking. Quakers have been known to  have the gout. The opportunities in Philadelphia to enjoy the pleasures  of the table were soon unlimited. Farm, garden, and dairy products,  vegetables, poultry, beef, and mutton were soon produced in immense  quantity and variety and of excellent quality. John Adams, coming from  the \"plain living and high thinking\" of Boston to attend the first  meeting of the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, was invited to dine  with Stephen Collins, a typical Quaker, and was amazed at the feast set  before him. From that time his diary records one after another of these  \"sinful feasts,\" as he calls them. But the sin at which he thus looks  askance never seems to have withheld him from a generous indulgence.  \"Drank Madeira at a great rate,\" he says on one occasion, \"and took no  harm from it.\" Madeira obtained in the trade with Spain was the popular  drink even at the taverns. Various forms of punch and rum were common,  but the modern light wines and champagne were not then in vogue.    Food in great quantity and variety seems to have been placed on the  table at the same time, with little regard to formal courses. Beef,  poultry, and mutton would all be served at one dinner. Fruit and nuts  were placed on the table in profusion, as well as puddings and desserts  numerous and deadly. Dinners were served usually in the afternoon. The  splendid banquet which Adams describes as given to some members of the  Continental Congress by Chief Justice Chew at his country seat was held  at four in the afternoon. The dinner hour was still in the afternoon  long after the Revolution and down to the times of the Civil War. Other  relics of this old love of good living lasted into modern times. It  was not so very long ago that an occasional householder of wealth and  distinction in Philadelphia could still be found who insisted on doing  his own marketing in the old way, going himself the first thing in the  morning on certain days to the excellent markets and purchasing all the  family supplies. Philadelphia poultry is still famous the country over;  and to be a good judge of poultry was in the old days as much a point of  merit as to be a good judge of Madeira. A typical Philadelphian, envious  New Yorkers say, will still keep a line of depositors waiting at a bank  while he discourses to the receiving teller on what a splendid purchase  of poultry he had made that morning. Early in the last century a wealthy  leader of the bar is said to have continued the old practice of going  to market followed by a negro with a wheelbarrow to bring back the  supplies. Not content with feasting in their own homes, the colonial  Philadelphians were continually banqueting at the numerous taverns, from  the Coach and Horses, opposite the State House, down to the Penny  Pot Inn close by the river. At the Coach and Horses, where the city  elections were usually held, the discarded oyster shells around it had  been trampled into a hard white and smooth floor over which surged the  excited election crowds. In those taverns the old fashion prevailed of  roasting great joints of meat on a turnspit before an open fire; and to  keep the spit turning before the heat little dogs were trained to work  in a sort of treadmill cage.    In nothing is this colonial prosperity better revealed than in the  quality of the country seats. They were usually built of stone and  sometimes of brick and stone, substantial, beautifully proportioned,  admirable in taste, with a certain simplicity, yet indicating a people  of wealth, leisure, and refinement, who believed in themselves and  took pleasure in adorning their lives. Not a few of these homes on  the outskirts of the city have come down to us unharmed, and Cliveden,  Stenton, and Belmont are precious relics of such solid structure  that with ordinary care they will still last for centuries. Many were  destroyed during the Revolution; others, such as Landsdowne, the seat  of one of the Penn family, built in the Italian style, have disappeared;  others were wiped out by the city's growth. All of them, even the small  ones, were most interesting and typical of the life of the times. The  colonists began to build them very early. A family would have a solid,  brick town house and, only a mile or so away, a country house which  was equally substantial. Sometimes they built at a greater distance.  Governor Keith, for example, had a country seat, still standing though  built in the middle of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],[0,"Notes of a War Correspondent (#4)"],[1,"field-glasses.    Toward mid-day you would see a man leave the trench with a comrade's arm  around him, and start on the long walk to the town where the hospital  corps were waiting for him.  These men did not wear their wounds with  either pride or braggadocio, but regarded the wet sleeves and shapeless  arms in a sort of wondering surprise.  There was much more of surprise  than of pain in their faces, and they seemed to be puzzling as to what  they had done in the past to deserve such a punishment.                [Picture: Firing from the trenches at Velestinos]    Other men were carried out of the trench and laid on their backs on the  high grass, staring up drunkenly at the glaring sun, and with their limbs  fallen into unfamiliar poses.  They lay so still, and they were so  utterly oblivious of the roar and rattle and the anxious energy around  them that one grew rather afraid of them and of their superiority to  their surroundings.  The sun beat on them, and the insects in the grass  waving above them buzzed and hummed, or burrowed in the warm moist earth  upon which they lay; over their heads the invisible carriers of death  jarred the air with shrill crescendoes, and near them a comrade sat  hacking with his bayonet at a lump of hard bread.  He sprawled  contentedly in the hot sun, with humped shoulders and legs far apart, and  with his cap tipped far over his eyes.  Every now and again he would  pause, with a piece of cheese balanced on the end of his knife-blade, and  look at the twisted figures by him on the grass, or he would dodge  involuntarily as a shell swung low above his head, and smile nervously at  the still forms on either side of him that had not moved.  Then he  brushed the crumbs from his jacket and took a drink out of his hot  canteen, and looking again at the sleeping figures pressing down the long  grass beside him, crawled back on his hands and knees to the trench and  picked up his waiting rifle.    The dead gave dignity to what the other men were doing, and made it  noble, and, from another point of view, quite senseless.  For their dying  had proved nothing.  Men who could have been much better spared than  they, were still alive in the trenches, and for no reason but through  mere dumb chance.  There was no selection of the unfittest; it seemed to  be ruled by unreasoning luck.  A certain number of shells and bullets  passed through a certain area of space, and men of different bulks  blocked that space in different places.  If a man happened to be standing  in the line of a bullet he was killed and passed into eternity, leaving a  wife and children, perhaps, to mourn him.  \"Father died,\" these children  will say, \"doing his duty.\"  As a matter of fact, father died because he  happened to stand up at the wrong moment, or because he turned to ask the  man on his right for a match, instead of leaning toward the left, and he  projected his bulk of two hundred pounds where a bullet, fired by a man  who did not know him and who had not aimed at him, happened to want the  right of way.  One of the two had to give it, and as the bullet would  not, the soldier had his heart torn out.  The man who sat next to me  happened to stoop to fill his cartridge-box just as the bullet that  wanted the space he had occupied passed over his bent shoulder; and so he  was not killed, but will live for sixty years, perhaps, and will do much  good or much evil.  Another man in the same trench sat up to clean his  rifle, and had his arm in the air driving the cleaning rod down the  barrel, when a bullet passed through his lungs, and the gun fell across  his face, with the rod sticking in it, and he pitched forward on his  shoulder quite dead.  If he had not cleaned his gun at that moment he  would probably be alive in Athens now, sitting in front of a cafe and  fighting the war over again.  Viewed from that point, and leaving out the  fact that God ordered it all, the fortunes of the game of war seemed as  capricious as matching pennies, and as impersonal as the wheel at Monte  Carlo.  In it the brave man did not win because he was brave, but because  he was lucky.  A fool and a philosopher are equal at a game of dice.  And  these men who threw dice with death were interesting to watch, because,  though they gambled for so great a stake, they did so unconcernedly and  without flinching, and without apparently appreciating the seriousness of  the game.    There was a red-headed, freckled peasant boy, in dirty petticoats, who  guided Bass and myself to the trenches.  He was one of the few peasants  who had not run away, and as he had driven sheep over every foot of the  hills, he was able to guide the soldiers through those places where they  were best protected from the bullets of the enemy.  He did this all day,  and was always, whether coming or going, under a heavy fire; but he  enjoyed that fact, and he seemed to regard the battle only as a  delightful change in the quiet routine of his life, as one of our own  country boys at home would regard the coming of the spring circus or the  burning of a neighbor's barn.  He ran dancing ahead of us, pointing to  where a ledge of rock offered a natural shelter, or showing us a steep  gully where the bullets could not fall.  When they came very near him he  would jump high in the air, not because he was startled, but out of pure  animal joy in the excitement of it, and he would frown importantly and  shake his red curls at us, as though to say: \"I told you to be careful.  Now, you see.  Don't let that happen again.\"  We met him many times  during the two days, escorting different companies of soldiers from one  point to another, as though they were visitors to his estate.  When a  shell broke, he would pick up a piece and present it to the officer in  charge, as though it were a flower he had plucked from his own garden,  and which he wanted his guest to carry away with him as a souvenir of his  visit.  Some one asked the boy if his father and mother knew where he  was, and he replied, with amusement, that they had run away and deserted  him, and that he had remained because he wished to see what a Turkish  army looked like.  He was a much more plucky boy than the overrated  Casabianca, who may have stood on the burning deck whence all but him had  fled because he could not swim, and because it was with him a choice of  being either burned or drowned.  This boy stuck to the burning deck when  it was possible for him at any time to have walked away and left it  burning.  But he stayed on because he was amused, and because he was able  to help the soldiers from the city in safety across his native heath.  He  was much the best part of the show, and one of the bravest Greeks on the  field.  He will grow up to be something fine, no doubt, and his spirit  will rebel against having to spend his life watching his father's sheep.  He may even win the race from Marathon.    Another Greek who was a most interesting figure to us was a Lieutenant  Ambroise Frantzis.  He was in command of the mountain battery on the  flat, round top of the high hill.  On account of its height the place  seemed much nearer to the sun than any other part of the world, and the  heat there was three times as fierce as in the trenches below.  When you  had climbed to the top of this hill it was like standing on a  roof-garden, or as though you were watching a naval battle from a  fighting top of one of the battleships.  The top of the hill was not  unlike an immense circus ring in appearance.  The piled-up earth around  its circular edge gave that impression, and the glaring yellow wheat that  was tramped into glaring yellow soil, and the blue ammunition-boxes  scattered about, helped out the illusion.  It was an exceedingly busy  place, and the smoke drifted across it continually, hiding us from one  another in a curtain of flying yellow dust, while over our heads the  Turkish shells raced after each other so rapidly that they beat out the  air like the branches of a tree in a storm.  On account of its height,  and the glaring heat, and the shells passing, and the Greek guns going  off and then turning somersaults, it was not a place suited for  meditation; but Ambroise Frantzis meditated there as though he were in  his own study.  He was a very young man and very shy, and he was too busy  to consider his own safety, or to take time, as the others did, to show  that he was not considering it.  Some of the other officers stood up on  the breastworks and called the attention of the men to what they were  doing; but as they did not wish the men to follow their example in this,  it was difficult to see what they expected to gain by their braggadocio.  Frantzis was as unconcerned as an artist painting a big picture in his  studio.  The battle plain below him was his canvas, and his nine mountain  guns were his paint brushes.  And he painted out Turks and Turkish cannon  with the same concentrated, serious expression of countenance that you  see on the face of an artist when he bites one brush between his lips and  with another wipes out a false line or a touch of the wrong color.  You  have seen an artist cock his head on one side, and shut one eye and frown  at his canvas, and then select several brushes and mix different colors  and hit the canvas a bold stroke, and then lean back to note the effect.  Frantzis acted in just that way.  He would stand with his legs apart and  his head on one side, pulling meditatively at his pointed beard, and then  taking a closer look through his field-glasses, would select the three  guns he had decided would give him the effect he wanted to produce, and  he would produce that effect.  When the shot struck plump in the Turkish  lines, and we could see the earth leap up into the air like geysers of  muddy water, and each gunner would wave his cap and cheer, Frantzis would  only smile uncertainly, and begin again, with the aid of his  field-glasses, to"]]]
