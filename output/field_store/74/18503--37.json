But  Spiritualists, Pantheists, Atheists, and Deists inform us that an  external revelation is useless. Their common exposition of the sentiment  is too well known to need comment. We hear them saying, \"You need say  nothing about the Bible to me; I know my duty well enough without it;  and as for miracles, they will never prove anything to me. Can thunder,  repeated daily through centuries, make God's laws and his wisdom and  goodness more God-like? No! I am grown, perchance, to manhood, and do  not need the thunder and terror. I am not to be scared. It is not  _fear_, but _reverence_, that shall lead me! _Revelation!_ Inspiration!  And thy own God-like spirit; is not that a revelation?\" See Carlyle's  \"Past and Present,\" page 307.    Now, if Mr. Carlyle was in no need of the fear of God, somebody else  may be in a different mental and moral condition. There is nothing in  which men differ more. If one man is above the weakness of fearing God  (?) all men are not. Say what we may of fear, it is nevertheless true  that we are greatly influenced by fear. We are greatly indebted to the  fear of sickness for health, to the fear of poverty for wealth, and to  the fear of death for life. Fear is to caution what knowledge is to a  wise choice. Where there is no fear there is no caution. The love of  life and bliss is natural, therefore we fear sickness, poverty and  death. Why say with your lips, \"I am above fear,\" while away down in  your heart you know it to be a lie?    Love and fear, like the Siamese twins, live and perish together. Do we  not _need_ \"revelation?\" Where is the shadow, and where is the sunshine?  May we not contrast them? The very wisest of heathen legislators  approved of vice in some of its most heinous forms. The Carthaginian law  required human sacrifices. When Agathoclas besieged Carthage two hundred  children of the most noted families were put to death by command of the  Senate, and three hundred citizens sacrificed themselves to Saturn. See  Diodorus Siculus, b. 20, ch. 14. The laws of Sparta required theft and  the death of unhealthy children. The laws of Rome allowed parents to  kill their child, if they pleased to do it. At the headquarters of  heathen literature it was recommended that maimed infants should be  killed or exposed to death. Aristotle's Political Library, 7, chapter  17. In Plato's Republic we discover an advance of society, but a  community of wives continues, and what was termed woman's rights was  maintained upon the condition that the women were trained to war. In war  times the children were led out to look upon the struggle, and become  accustomed and hardened to blood. The teachings of the best minds were  immoral. \"He may lie,\" says Plato, \"who knows how to do it.\" Profane  swearing was enjoined by the example of their best writers. Oaths are of  common occurrence in the writings of Seneca and Plato. Aristippus  taught that adultery and theft were commendable in a wise man, and  Cicero plead for the last dreadful tragedy--_suicide_. Such immoralities  are eulogised in the writings of Virgil, Horace and Ovid. When Rome was  in her glory and greatness, Trajan had ten thousand men to hew each  other to pieces to amuse the Romans. In the face of all these facts,  modern Spiritualists advance along with Deists, Atheists and Pantheists,  and gravely inform us that we have no need of any external  revelation--that men are wise enough without it.    They argue, that as we have physical senses to take hold of earth's  material blessings and appropriate them; so we have intellectual  faculties to take hold of all else that is necessary to supply our  mental and moral wants. It is most certainly true that we have physical  senses and intellectual faculties. I can not tell how it is with all the  infidels of our country, but I do know persons having physical senses  who are in great need of some of the substantials of life. I have also  known persons who have destroyed their physical senses to such an extent  as to be miserable objects of pity and compassion, needing some external  help as well an internal. Now, if, in spite of physical senses, men and  women do starve in this world on account of want, it is certainly  allowable that persons may fail of the enjoyment of needed mental and  moral culture in spite of intellectual faculties. And if it is a matter  of charity for men to put forth their hands and assist their fellow men  when they are in want of material blessings, surely it is a matter of  love, the love of God, to present to weary, burthened souls mental and  spiritual blessings which correlate with man's spiritual wants. Do you  deny the existence of such wants?    Tyndal said there is a place in man's soul-nature for religion. This  fact is acknowledged by all leading writers in unbelief. He who calls it  in question experiences the fact. Why say it is not true against the  testimony of your own conscience?    \"Tell me,\" said a rich Hindoo who had given all his wealth to the  Brahmans surrounding his dying bed that they might obtain pardon for his  sins, \"tell me what will become of my soul when I die?\" \"Your soul will  go into the body of a holy cow.\" \"And after that?\" \"It will pass into  the body of a divine peacock.\" \"And after that?\" \"It will pass into a  flower.\" \"Tell me, oh! tell me,\" cried the dying man, \"where will it go  last of all?\" \"Where will it go last of all? Aye, that is the question  reason can not answer,\" said the poor Brahmans.    Where there is no vision the people perish. \"Life and immortality was  brought to light through the Gospel.\" Without a revelation from God, men  know neither how to live or die. Our ancestors trusted to the powers of  magic, to incantations, for health, for success in tilling the ground,  for finding lost articles, for preventing accidents, etc. They  superstitiously regarded certain days of the week. If an infant was born  upon a certain day it would live; if upon another it would live, but be  sickly.    Do you unceremoniously reject the Gospel of the Christ? \"Yes,\" you say,  \"if it depends on Jesus it is not eternally true, and therefore is not  true at all.\" But, I ask in all candor, is eternally true and  sufficiently revealed _one_ and the _same_? Are we under no obligations  to the man who first informed us of vaccination as a preventive of  small-pox, simply because it would always have prevented it? Are we  under no obligations to men on account of scientific discoveries, just  because the truths discovered are eternal truths? _Nonsense!_ You know  it is nonsense. Then we may be under lasting obligations to the Christ  for the revelation of the Gospel, with its sublime precepts and  principles, consolations and promises, which fill up the human spirit  with undying love and the hope of eternal glory.    Let parents look well to this question. Let infidels set themselves to  work and get up some law of man capable of regenerating the hearts of  those men who, at their bidding, renounce the law of God and his  authority, and also with it all human authority. Will they do it? Can  they do it? Oh! There are no means outside of the sanctions of religion  by which the heart may be reached and purified from the love and  practice of sin.    What right, says the Pantheist, the Atheist, the Deist, and  Spiritualist, have you to command me?    The rejectors of the Bible made an experiment, an attempt, in trying to  govern France without religion. Shall the scenes of Paris and Lyons be  repeated, re-enacted in our own beloved America? No, we don't want it,  and we do not think we shall experience it, for the framers of our  Declaration of Independence laid the rights of God in the bed-rock of  our republic, believing that the rights of God are the basis of human  rights. \"All men are born free and equal, and are endowed by their  CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS, AMONG WHICH IS LIFE, LIBERTY  AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, ETC.\"    Nations destitute of the Bible ever were, and are, ignorant and wicked.  There are peoples in the world decently clad, well fed, and living in  comfortable mansions, with well tilled lands, who make powerful streams  turn powerful wheels and run great machinery; who yoke the iron horse to  the market train and drive their floating palaces against the floods;  who erect churches in every village, and make their children more  learned than the priests of Egypt, or the philosophers of Greece; even  many of their criminals are more decent and upright than were the sages,  philosophers and heroes of lands destitute of the Bible. These peoples  have that wonderful book; and they claim that it contains a revelation  from God to man; and that it teaches us how to live, and how to die.    \"EVERY TREE IS KNOWN BY ITS OWN FRUITS.\"          *      *      *      *      *    \"The fool hath said in his heart there is no God.\" He claims, however,  that something without life or intelligence produced organic nature.  That BLIND, DEAD, SOMETHING IS THE FOOL'S GOD.          THE WAY INFIDELS TREAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE BIBLE.      The unreasonableness and unfairness of infidels, or otherwise their  ignorance, is manifested in their unwillingness to interpret the  literature of religion as they do the language of the sciences. In  scientific literature we speak of the earth as a sphere, and infidels  never think of objecting that it is \"pitted with hollows deep as ocean's  bottom,\" and \"crusted with protuberances high as the Himalaya,\" in every  imaginable form. \"There is not an acre of absolutely level ground\" known  on the face of the earth, and yet when we speak of land, saying it is  level, no infidel demurs. The waters pile themselves in waves and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28669"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. 8, (#4)"],[1," was the  sole end in view, and when their laws were virtuous, it was a noble, a  praiseworthy end. But the religion of Christ is related to the same  object, brings it about; and, also, has a nobler end in view, and that  is to prepare us here for a more noble society among the citizens of  the kingdom of God in the great hereafter.    In all the older religions the good of the present was the direct, and  the first object, but in the religion of Christ it is the second. The  first great object of the gospel of Christ is to prepare us for the  realities of eternity.    There is a great contrast between adhering to morality from the motive  of present profit, in expectation of future reward, and living such a  life as to qualify us for the realization of future happiness.    The character of those who are governed by these different principles is  not the same. On the first principle, present utility, we may have mere  moralists, men practicing simple justice, temperance and sobriety. On  the second, we must add to those graces of moral nature faith in God,  resignation to his will, and habitual piety. The first will make us very  good citizens in a civil government, but will never be sufficient to  make us Christians. So the religion of Christ insists upon purity of  heart and benevolence, or charity, because these are essential to the  end proposed.    \"That the present existence is one of trial with reference to another  state of being, is confirmed by all that we know in what is termed the  course of nature. Probation is the only key that unfolds to us the  designs of God in the history of human affairs, the only clue that  guides us through the pathless wilderness, and the only plan upon which  this world could possibly have been formed, or upon which its history  can be explained.\"    This world was not formed upon a plan of unconditioned happiness,  because it is overspread with miseries. Neither was it formed upon a  plan of unconditioned misery, for there are many joys interspersed  throughout the whole. It was not formed for the unconditional existence  of both vice and virtue, for that is no plan at all, the two elements  being, as we know, destructive of each other. By the way, in this very  fact we find the grand necessity for the remedial scheme.    The mixture of vice and virtue, of happiness and misery, is a necessary  result of a state of probation, trials and sufferings consequent upon  offending or violating the will of heaven.    The doctrine of the religion of Christ, with its ultimate object and its  ideas of God and man, of the present and the future life, and of the  relations which these all bear to each other, was and is wholly unheard  of until you come to the teachings of Christ. No other religion ever  drew such pictures of the worthlessness of earthly-mindedness and of  living merely for this present world. And no other ever set out such  beautiful, lively and glorious pictures of heavenly-mindedness, along  with the joys of a future world, nor such pictures of victory over death  and the grave, nor of the last judgment, nor of the triumphs of the  redeemed in that tremendous day. The personal character of the great  author, Christ, is as new and peculiar to this religion as anything else  that we can possibly name--\"He spake as never man spake.\"    He is the only founder of a religion which is \"unconnected with all  human policy and government,\" and, as such, should not be prostituted to  any mere worldly purposes whatever. Numa, Mohammed, and even Moses,  blended their religious institutions with their civil, and by such means  controlled their adherents. Christ neither exercised nor accepted such  power. He rejected every motive which controlled other leaders, and  chose those which others avoided. Power, honor, riches and pleasure were  alike disregarded. He seemed to court poverty, sufferings and death.    Many impostors and enthusiasts have tried to impose upon the world with  pretended communications from the world of spirits--some of them have  died rather than recant; but no history is found to show one who made  his own sufferings and death a necessary part of his plan and essential  elements in his mission. This distinguishes the Savior of the world from  all mere enthusiasts and imposters. He declared his death in all its  minutia; with a prophet's vision he saw it, declared it was necessary,  and voluntarily endured it; and he was neither a madman nor idiot. Look  at his lessons, his precepts and his wonderful conduct, and then  imagine him insane if you can. Still, if he was not what he pretended to  be, he can be viewed in no other light; and yet under the character of a  madman he deserves much attention on account of such sublime and  _rational insanity_. There is no other person known in the world's  history so _rationally_ and _sublimely_ mad.    In what madman's career can you find such a beautiful lesson as his  instructions given upon the mount. What other leader enforced his  precepts and lessons upon men's credulity with such assurances of reward  as, \"Come, ye blessed of my father! Inherit the kingdom prepared for you  from the foundation of the world; for I was an hungered, and ye gave me  meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took  me in; I was naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I  was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him,  saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee; or thirsty,  and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in; or  naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick and in prison, and  came unto thee? Then shall he answer and say unto them, Verily, I say  unto you, inasmuch as you have done it to the least of these, my  brethren, ye have done it unto me.\"    Before the appearance of Christ there existed nothing like the faith of  Christ and Christianity upon the face of the earth. The Jews alone had a  few of its types and shadows, but the great mystery of Christ had been  kept hid since the world began. All the Gentile nations were wrapped up  in the very worst idolatry, having little or no connection whatever with  morality, except to corrupt it with the infamous examples of their gods.  \"They all worshiped a multitude of gods and demons, whose favor they  sought by obscene and ridiculous ceremonies, and whose anger they tried  to appease with the most abominable cruelties.\" With them, heaven was  open only to legislators and conquerors, the civilizers and destroyers  of mankind. This was the summit of their religion, and even this was  limited to a few prodigies of genius and learning, which was but little  regarded and understood by the great masses. One common cloud of  ignorance and superstition involved them. At this time Christ came as a  teacher; his appearance was like a rising sun, dispelling the darkness  and blessing the earth with light and heat.    If any man can believe that the son of a carpenter, together with twelve  of the meanest and most illiterate mechanics, unassisted by any  superhuman wisdom and power, should be able to invent and promulgate a  system of theology and ethics the most sublime and perfect, which all  such men as Plato, Aristotle and Cicero had overlooked, and that they,  by their own wisdom, repudiated every false virtue, though universally  admired, and that they admitted every true virtue, though despised and  ridiculed by all the rest of the world--if any man can believe that they  were _impostors_ for no other purpose than the promulgation of truth,  _villains_ for no purpose but to teach honesty, and _martyrs_ with no  prospect of honor or advantage; or that they, as false witnesses, should  have been able, in the course of a few years, to have spread this  religion over the most of the known world, in opposition to the  interests, ambition and prejudices of mankind; that they triumphed over  the power of princes, the intrigues of states, the forces of custom, the  blindness of zeal, the influence of priests, the arguments of orators,  and the philosophy of the world, without any assistance from God, he  must be in possession of more faith than is necessary to make him a  Christian and continues an unbeliever from mere credulity. If the  credulous infidel, whose convictions are without evidence and against  evidence, should, after all, be in the right, and Christianity prove to  be a fable, what harm could ensue from being a Christian? Are Christian  rulers more tyrannical and their Christian subjects more ungovernable?  Are the rich more insolent _when Christianized_? Are poor Christians  most insolent and disorderly? Does Christianity make worse parents and  worse children? Does it make husbands and wives, friends and neighbors  less trustworthy? Does it not make men and women more virtuous and happy  in every situation in life? If Christianity is a fable, it is one the  belief of which retains men and women in a regular and uniform life of  virtue, piety and devotion to truth. It gives support in the hour of  distress, of sickness and death.    \"If there were a few more Christians in the world it would be very  beneficial to themselves and by no means detrimental to the public.\"          THE RESURRECTION OF THE CHRIST.      \"He, who gave life to man at first,    Can restore it when it is lost.\"      Our Savior claimed to be the Son of God, and put the validity of his  claim on this, that he should die openly by crucifixion, be buried, and  rise from the dead upon the third day. Among all the impostors known in  earth's history there is not one instance of a _plot_ like this fact. A  mere plot of this nature would be hard to manage. That the first part of  this prophesy was fulfilled even our enemies admit. It has not been  alleged by infidels of any note that the crucifixion was a fraud, and  did not take place, and that Jesus, as a consequence, did not die.    The chief"]]]
