CHAPTER I.    THE ANTE-BELLUM LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.        Birth--Ancestry--School-Boy Days--Appointment as Cadet at the United      States Military Academy--Graduates of Historic Classes--Assignment as      Brevet Lieutenant--Gay Life of Garrison at Jefferson      Barracks--Lieutenant Grant's Courtship--Annexation of Texas--Army of      Observation--Army of Occupation--Camp Life in Texas--March to the Rio      Grande--Mexican War.      I was born in Edgefield District, South Carolina, on the 8th of January,  1821. On the paternal side the family was from New Jersey; on my mother's  side, from Maryland. My earliest recollections were of the Georgia side of  Savannah River, and my school-days were passed there, but the appointment  to West Point Academy was from North Alabama. My father, James Longstreet,  the oldest child of William Longstreet and Hannah Fitzrandolph, was born  in New Jersey. Other children of the marriage, Rebecca, Gilbert, Augustus  B., and William, were born in Augusta, Georgia, the adopted home. Richard  Longstreet, who came to America in 1657 and settled in Monmouth County,  New Jersey, was the progenitor of the name on this continent. It is  difficult to determine whether the name sprang from France, Germany, or  Holland. On the maternal side, Grandfather Marshall Dent was first cousin  of John Marshall, of the Supreme Court. That branch claimed to trace their  line back to the Conqueror. Marshall Dent married a Magruder, when they "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38428"],[0,"Through a Microscope (#4)"],[1,"filaments of the small plants belonging to the _confervae_ and the  _oscillatoriae_; sometimes you will find small round opaque forms of  brown or green color, which are probably spores of plants of a larger  growth; sometimes you will see the pollen of pine-trees which has fallen  into the water and looks like three small balls fastened together;  sometimes, though rarely, you may find one of those curious little  creatures called water bears, or _tardigrada_; and you may be fortunate  enough to catch a water spider.      [Illustration: CLOSTERIUM MONILIFERUM.]    But you will often see the _spiculae_ of the sponge, called _Spongilla  fluviatilis_. They look like pins of glass, blunt at one end and  pointed at the other, and are sometimes very abundant. You may have  heard that this sponge has been considered the source of the  occasionally bad taste and smell of Cochituate water. When it is alive,  it is not disagreeable, but when it decays it imparts to the water a  very unpleasant taste and odor. It certainly is one cause of the bad  quality of the water, but whether it is entitled to the sole credit is  still open to question.    You can see what it looks like in _fig. 6_. When alive, it is of a  light-green color, but when decayed it becomes brown. It is full of the  _spiculae_ above described, which serve to stiffen it, but it easily  crumbles and scatters them through the water.    Though the microscope shows us many beautiful and interesting objects,  yet in the present state of our knowledge we cannot ascertain by its use  whether the water we examine is harmless or injurious.      VII.--THE BRICKMAKER.    The microscope reveals so many strange odd-looking water creatures and  plants that we can easily imagine ourselves transported to some new  world. Look at this field of view as seen through the microscope. In the  centre stands a brickmaker. He is a queer little animal, and so small  that he looks like a mere speck to the naked eye, but through the  microscope we see how wonderfully curious and strange a creature he is.  He is no idle, lazy fellow. He is instead a most busy mechanic.    Just now he is building a house out of tiny bricks, and he manufactures  the bricks himself, making them one at a time, and when one is finished  he lays it down carefully by the side of the last, and fastens it firmly  in its place with a kind of cement. The bricks are laid in regular tiers  one above the other.    We find these brickmakers in still water where various water-plants  grow, especially the water-milfoil and bladderwort. They seem to be  social beings. They live in large communities, attaching their houses to  the stems and leaves of the plants so thickly sometimes that they almost  touch one another. They look, to the naked eye, like lines about one  eighth of an inch in length. Sometimes they are very thick on the plants  in New Jersey ponds.    If you take some of the plants and water, and put them in a bottle, you  can carry a large number of the brickmakers home, where you can watch  them at your leisure. Take a glass slide which has a little cup-shaped  hollow to hold a few drops of water, and put a tiny piece of the plant  with the house attached into this hollow and fill it with some of the  water from the bottle. Now cover it with a very thin piece of glass and  lay it over the stage of the microscope, and it is ready to be looked at  and studied. You will look with both eyes, for your microscope is a  binocular--one that has two tubes to look through. The size of the  objects will depend upon the magnifying power you have chosen.    The first thing you see is a dark, brick-colored, cylinder-shaped house  which looks to be about the size of a cigar. The little builder who  lives in this house has been disturbed by the means we have taken to  make his acquaintance; he has stopped work and gone within. But he is so  industrious a fellow that he will not remain within very long. As soon  as it is quite still he will probably come to the door of his house, and  you will see him thrust out two horns. He will move these horns to the  right and left, cautiously feeling all around him. He seems very  cautious indeed. But at last he is satisfied that no enemy is near. Now  he ventures out. He unfolds his wheels.    These wheels are surrounded with a band of _cilia_, or flexible hairs,  which he can put in rapid motion, making the wheels have the appearance  of revolving very fast. This rapid motion of the cilia forms a swift  current in the water; and this current brings tiny particles of various  things to the little mechanic. Some of these particles he uses for food;  of others, he makes brick. They are carried into an opening between the  wheels where you can see them revolving very fast until they are  gathered into a little round, dark-colored pellet. The particles are  probably held together by a sticky secretion made by the builder.    It takes him about three minutes to make a brick. As soon as it is  finished, he bends his head over, takes it from its mould between the  wheels, and lays it down carefully by the side of the last. Then he  raises his head and begins to make another. The tube thus constructed is  quite firm and strong. Sometimes when I have found a long tube, I have  cut off a portion from the top. This can be done, with care, for the  brickmaker drops to the bottom when disturbed. It is very amusing to  watch him repair damages and rebuild. Sometimes I have forced one out of  his tube, but it always soon died. But though industrious, he is so  cautious, or timid, that he is easily frightened, and therefore he is  often interrupted in his work. For instance, like some people that we  know, he is very afraid of snakes. If a harmless little tiny snake comes  wriggling along through the water anywhere near him, he folds his wheels  and drops down into his house as quick as a flash. One day a little boy  was delighted with the fast-revolving wheels. Suddenly, by and by, he  turned toward me with great disgust plainly showing in his face: \"He's  gone in, 'fraid of a little snake!\" he exclaimed.      [Illustration: FIGURE 1, BRICKMAKER; 2, CURRENT IN WATER; 3, 4, 5, 6,    DIATOMS; 7, 8, DESMIDS; 9, ALGAE; 10, 11, TRICHODA LYNCEUS; 12,    SNAKE-LIKE LARVA; 13, PART OF PLANT TO WHICH BRICKMAKER IS ATTACHED;    14, BATRACHOSPERMUM MONILIFORM.]    He is always a great favorite with those who have watched him through  the microscope. I do not know how long they live, but I have kept the  same individuals three months or more. I think no one knows the entire  life-history of any of these little creatures, so here is a grand chance  for any young microscopist to investigate and become famous.    On the left of the brickmaker in our field of view is a delicate,  beautiful plant. Only a small part of it is seen in the engraving. It  has a long, floating stem, thickly set with rosettes of a pearly green  color. To the naked eye it looks like green slime, and is called \"frog's  spawn;\" but the microscope shows us that it is a lovely plant, and some  wise man has given us a long fine name to call it by if we  choose--_Batrachospermum moniliform_. Let us see if this long name has  any meaning: _Batrachia_, a frog, _spermum_, spawn; ah, after all, only  another name for frog spawn! The other name, _moniliform_, means a  bead-like necklace; and this was given it because the threads that make  the rosettes look like strings of small pearly-green beads.    All of the strange-looking plants and animals that we see in the  microscope are known as well by sight and by name by those who make them  a study, as are the larger animals and plants that we see around us  every day.    A bright little girl once asked me why such long hard names are given to  everything in nature. We told her if there was but one language spoken  in the world there would be no need of using Latin names. But as there  are many languages, it was found necessary to agree upon some system, so  that all peoples of different nations might have the same name for an  animal or plant, and a long time ago all the civilized world agreed to  use Latin names. Thus our little brickmaker is known all over the world  as _Melicerta ringens_.    \"A field of view\" depends for its interest and variety upon what kind of  water we put under the microscope. In the one here represented, I first  took a tiny spray of plant with a brickmaker's house attached, and laid  it on the hollow glass slide and then used the dipping-tube and brought  up some of the sediment from the bottom of the bottle; this proved to  contain several singular-looking plants and animals shown here.    _Figures_ 3, 4, 5 and 6, are diatoms, and _figures_ 7 and 8 are  desmids. Naturalists formerly placed both diatoms and desmids in the  animal kingdom, but now all agree that the desmids are plants, while  some few still maintain that the diatoms are animals. But the weight of  evidence is on the plant side of the question.    The desmids are wonderfully beautiful plants; the markings and colors  are exquisite. A number of species are found in the sediment of every  swamp and pond.    The diatoms often grow in long ribbon-like masses (_fig. 3_), and then  partially separate, remaining joined together at the angles so as to  form a zigzag chain as seen at _figure 4_. They have the power of moving  through the water, changing their places like animals.    A great variety of forms are found, both diatoms and desmids, many still  undescribed, inviting the young microscopist to study and name them.    _Figures_ 10 and 11 are different forms of a little animal, _Trichoda  lynceus_. It undergoes a great many changes. In some of its stages, it  looks so different from the figures here represented that you would  never dream of its being the same creature.
