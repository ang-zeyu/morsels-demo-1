Now Spot cocked his ear in the direction of the pond and listened. Sure  enough! he could hear Johnnie Green's whistle.    \"I'll see you again,\" he told Frisky Squirrel.    \"Not if I see you first!\" Frisky muttered as old Spot started through  the woods for the mill pond.    \"Come here!\" Johnnie Green greeted him sternly when, a few minutes  later, he appeared on the bank. \"Where are those clothes that you  took?\"    Spot wagged his tail. He acted very, very friendly. Nobody would have  supposed, from his looks, that he had stolen anyone's clothes.    \"This is no joke,\" Johnnie Green declared. \"I haven't anything to wear.  Get those clothes and bring them back here!\"    \"I don't know what's the matter with Johnnie,\" Spot thought. \"I didn't  touch his things. I don't see why he's so angry.\"    \"Good old Spot!\" Johnnie coaxed. \"Find the clothes! There's a good  fellow!\"    He waded toward the bank and snapped his fingers at Spot.    The old dog edged away. Johnnie _talked_ pleasantly enough. But he had  a queer look in his eye. Spot thought it safer to keep out of his  clutches.    Just then the miller came driving up the hill on a load of corn. When he  saw the boys in the pond he stopped his horses.    \"Anybody here lost any clothes?\" he asked, holding a bundle up in his  hand. \"I found these by the side of the road. I noticed them hanging on  a blackberry bush.\"    \"I'll take 'em!\" Johnnie Green cried. \"They belong to Red. But you can  leave them with me.\"    The miller tossed the bundle to him.    The boy Red, wearing Johnnie's clothes, was watching everything that  went on, from behind a tree. He waited until Johnnie had untied the  hard, wet knots in the clothes. Then he stepped out from his hiding  place.    \"Let's swap!\" he said. And while they were swapping, old dog Spot took a  swim in the mill pond. Somehow he felt that all was well again.          X    DROPPING HINTS      On the table in the kitchen of the farmhouse was a leg of mutton. Farmer  Green had left it there and gone away. And Mrs. Green had stepped out of  the kitchen--nobody knew for how long.    At least old dog Spot and Miss Kitty Cat didn't know. They were left  there in the kitchen alone--alone with the leg of mutton.    \"Ahem!\" said Miss Kitty Cat to old dog Spot. \"Don't you think you'd  better go and see what's become of Farmer Green?\"    She was unusually pleasant, for her. As a rule she had little to say to  Spot, except to scold at him.    \"I'm comfortable here, thank you,\" Spot answered. \"Farmer Green must be  out of sight by this time. So I won't bother to chase after him.\"    \"You could smell out his track, couldn't you?\" Miss Kitty Cat suggested.    \"Perhaps!\" said Spot. \"Perhaps! But as I said, I'm comfortable here. I'm  going to stay right here in the kitchen.\" Out of the corner of his eye  he looked at Miss Kitty Cat. He could see that she was somewhat  displeased by something or other. Her tail was beginning to swell  slightly. And that was a sure sign that she was losing her temper. But  when she spoke again her voice was as sweet as honey.    \"What a beautiful day to go hunting!\" she remarked as she sprang into a  chair beside the window and looked out. \"The woods must be full of  birds.\"    \"No doubt!\" said Spot dryly. \"I went hunting early this morning; and  there was plenty of game then.\"    \"Ha!\" Miss Kitty exclaimed suddenly. \"Do I hear the cows in the  cornfield?\"    Now, Spot loved to drive the cows out of the corn. But for a wonder, he  never even moved an ear.    \"I hope the sheep haven't scrambled over the stone wall,\" Miss Kitty Cat  mewed. \"If they have, Farmer Green would want you to get them back into  the pasture for him.\"    \"Yes!\" said Spot with a yawn. \"I'm sure he would. And if he needs me he  knows where he can find me.\"    Miss Kitty Cat's tail was growing bigger every moment. And the fur on  her back was beginning to stand on end. Still she managed to speak in  her very softest voice.    \"Did you know--\" she inquired--\"did you know that Johnnie Green had gone  swimming in the mill pond?\"    \"No!\" said Spot. \"Has he? I hope he'll have a good time. I had a fine  swim yesterday in Black Creek. And I almost caught a muskrat there.\"    As he spoke he rose and walked across the big, square kitchen and  stretched himself out on the floor right in front of the table where the  leg of mutton lay.    At that Miss Kitty Cat gave a terrible cry of rage.    \"I know why you won't leave the kitchen!\" she yowled. \"You think I'm  going to eat some of that mutton. And that's why you've lain down  alongside it.\"          XI    MRS. GREEN'S MISTAKE      Old dog Spot never moved from the place where he was lying in front of  the kitchen table. Although Miss Kitty Cat had told him angrily that he  thought she was going to enjoy a luncheon on the leg of mutton that was  on the kitchen table, he didn't lose his temper.    \"Pardon me!\" he said. \"You are mistaken. I don't think you're going to  have even a taste of this mutton--not while I'm in the kitchen!\"    Miss Kitty Cat was furious. She had done her best to make Spot go away.  She had dropped a number of hints to get him out of doors. But Spot  hadn't taken a single one of them.    \"You're a meddlesome old dog,\" she scolded. \"I've a good mind to drag my  claws across your nose.\"    Spot grinned at her.    \"If you do,\" he warned her, \"I shall yelp. Then Mrs. Green will hurry  back here to see what's going on. And you certainly won't get any mutton  while she's in the kitchen. I happen to know that the family's going to  have that leg of mutton for dinner to-morrow.\"    \"There ought to be enough of it for everybody,\" Miss Kitty Cat grumbled.  \"If I ate a bit of it nobody would ever miss it. And after I've finished  my meal there would be nothing to prevent your helping yourself. I  certainly shouldn't stand in your way--nor lie in it, either.\"    Old dog Spot couldn't help sniffing.    \"I never snatch any food when Mrs. Green's back is turned,\" he told Miss  Kitty Cat severely. \"She feeds me all she thinks I ought to eat. And if  I want more, I hunt for it in the woods and fields.\"    \"Don't I hunt?\" Miss Kitty Cat hissed. \"I keep the house free of rats  and mice. Mrs. Green could well spare me a bit of that mutton in return  for all I do for her.... I'll thank you, sir, to move away from that  table!\"    Old Spot began to look somewhat anxious. He had once felt Miss Kitty's  sharp claws on his nose. And he didn't care to be scratched by her  again. But there was the leg of mutton! He had to guard that for Mrs.  Green.    \"I wish Mrs. Green would come back,\" he said to himself. \"I don't want a  row with this Cat person.\"    Miss Kitty suddenly spat at him.    Spot knew that that was a danger sign. And he gave a few short, sharp  barks.    \"There!\" he muttered. \"That ought to fetch Mrs. Green. If she's in the  house she can't help hearing me.\"    Spot was right. In about a minute Farmer Green's wife came hurrying into  the kitchen.    Old dog Spot jumped up and wagged his tail and gave a low-pitched bark  as if to say, \"I've saved your leg of mutton for you, Mrs. Green.\"    But she didn't understand him.    \"You rascal!\" Mrs. Green exclaimed. \"You've been teasing the cat again.  I can tell by the way she acts. Out you go!\" And she opened the door.    Spot went.          XII    RIGHTING A WRONG      Poor Spot! He felt so mournful that he lifted up his muzzle and howled.  Farmer Green's wife had just ordered him out of the kitchen. She thought  he had been teasing Miss Kitty Cat. And instead he had kept Miss Kitty  from tasting the leg of mutton that lay on the kitchen table.    \"It's a sad, sad world!\" he howled. \"I thought Mrs. Green would praise  me. But she didn't. She scolded me!\"    \"Sakes alive!\" cried Henrietta Hen as she rushed up to him in the  farmyard. \"What's the matter with you? Are you trying to bay the moon in  the daytime?\"    Turkey Proudfoot gobbled at Spot and bade him be still. Turkey Proudfoot  was very pompous, for he had an idea that he ruled the farmyard.    Old dog Spot felt so meek, after the scolding that Mrs. Green gave him,  that he couldn't find a word to say to anybody that spoke to him.    \"I've expected this for some time,\" the Rooster told Henrietta Hen.  \"Mrs. Green has put old Spot out of the farmhouse. And Farmer Green  intends to put him off the farm. Everyone agrees that he's a nuisance.  It's a wonder the folks in the Green family have kept him all these  years.\"    Well, old dog Spot couldn't help hearing what the Rooster said. And he  hadn't even heart enough to answer that impertinent boaster.    \"Maybe he knows what he's talking about,\" Spot groaned. \"I wish Johnnie  Green would come home. _He'd_ stand up for me, if nobody else will.\"    Then something happened all at once that helped Spot's spirits  amazingly. The woodshed door flew open and Miss Kitty Cat all but flew  out of it. Farmer Green's wife appeared in the doorway with a broom in  her hand. And with it she helped Miss Kitty into the yard. She helped  her so much that Miss Kitty never touched the broad stone doorstep at  all.    \"Scat!\" cried Mrs. Green. \"I don't want any thieves in my kitchen.\"    It was quite plain that something had displeased Mrs. Green--something  in which Miss Kitty Cat had had a part. And old dog Spot thought he knew  what that something was.    \"Ha!\" he barked at Miss Kitty. \"So Mrs. Green found you out!\" And he  ran at Miss Kitty and chased her into a tree. She sat herself down upon  a limb and glared at him.    \"Wow!\" he yelped. \"You must have sampled that leg of mutton when you  thought Mrs."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30677"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#4)"],[1,"                  WILD TURKEY.

What would  Thanksgiving be without a Turkey, I'd like to know.    The editor says that I am a bird of ex-tra-or-di-na-ry size and beauty.  That word is as big as I am, but by spelling it, I guess you will  understand.    I look as proud as a peacock, don't I? Well, I am just as proud. You  ought to see me strut, and hear me talk when the hen-turkeys are around.  Why, sometimes when there is a large troop of us in the woods you can  hear us _gobble, gobble, gobble_, for many miles. We are so fond of  talking to each other.    That is when we are about to set up housekeeping, you think.    Yes, in March and April. After the nests are made, and the little  turkeys hatched out, we big, handsome fellows go off by ourselves. The  hen-turkeys, with their young broods, do the same.    Sometimes there are as many as a hundred in our troop and seventy or  eighty in theirs. We travel on foot, picking up food as we go, till we  meet a man with a gun, or come to a wide river.    Then we have to fly.    In a flock? Oh, yes. We choose some high place from which to get a good  start. There we all stay, sometimes a day or two, strutting about and  talking big. It is _gobble, gobble gobble_, from morning till night.  Just like one of your conventions, you know. After awhile our leader  gives the signal and off we all fly to the opposite shore.    Did you ever see one of our nests? No? Well, they are not easily seen,  though they are made on the ground. You see, we are cunning and build  them among tall, thick weeds and tangled briars.    I hope, if you ever come across one, you will not touch it, because my  mate would never return to it again, if you did.    What do we eat?    Berries, fruit and grasses, beetles, tadpoles, frogs and lizards. In  fact anything we consider good.          THE YELLOW-BILLED TROPIC BIRD.      In appearance this bird resembles a large Tern (see Vol. I, page 103),  and its habits are similar to those of the Terns. Inter-tropical, it  is of a wandering disposition, breeding on the islands of mid-ocean  thousands of miles apart. It is noted for its elegant, airy, and  long-protracted flight. Davie says that on Bourbon, Mauritius and other  islands east and south of Madagascar it breeds in the crevices of the  rocks of inaccessible cliffs, and in hollow trees. In the Bermuda  Islands it nests about the first of May in holes in high rocky places  along the shores. Here its favorite resorts are the small islands of  Great Sound, Castle Harbor, and Harrington Sound. The Phaeton, as it is  felicitously called, nests in the Bahamas in holes in the perpendicular  faces of cliffs and on the flat surfaces of rocks. A single egg is laid,  which has a ground-color of purplish brownish white, covered in some  specimens almost over the entire surface with fine reddish  chocolate-colored spots.    These species compose the small but distinct family of tropic birds and  are found throughout the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world.  Long journeys are made by them across the open sea, their flight when  emigrating being strong, rapid, and direct, and immense distances are  covered by them as they course undismayed by wind or storm. In feeding,  Chapman says, they course over the water, beating back and forth at a  height of about forty feet, and their long willowy tail-feathers add  greatly to the grace and beauty of their appearance when on the wing.  They are of rare and probably accidental occurrence on our coasts.          The Songs of Nature never cease,      Her players sue not for release      In nearer fields, on hills afar,      Attendant her musicians are:      From water brook or forest tree,      For aye comes gentle melody,      The very air is music blent--      An universal instrument.                  --JOHN VANCE CHENEY.           [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  YELLOW-BILLED TROPIC BIRD.                  Copyrighted by                  Nature Study Pub. Co., 1897, Chicago.]    THE YELLOW-BILLED TROPIC BIRD.      The people who make a study of birds say that I look like a large Tern,  and that my habits are like his.    I don't know whether that is so, I am sure, for I have no acquaintance  with that bird, but you little folks can turn to your March number of  BIRDS and see for yourselves if it is true.    For my part, I think I am the prettier of the two on account of my long,  willowy tail-feathers. They add greatly, it is said, to the grace and  beauty of my appearance when on the wing. Then, the color of my coat is  much more beautiful than his, I think, don't you think so, too?    We are not so common as the Terns, either, for they are very numerous.  There are only three species of our family, so we consider ourselves  quite distinct.    What are we noted for?    Well, principally for our long distance flights across the sea, elegant  and airy, as the writers say of us. Maybe that is the reason they call  us the Phaeton sometimes.    Do we go north in the summer as so many other birds do?    Ugh! You make me shudder. No, indeed! We never go farther north than  Florida. Our home, or where we build our nests, is in the tropical and  sub-tropical regions, where the weather is very warm, you know.    We are great wanderers and build our nests on islands, way out in the  ocean many thousands of miles apart.    In trees?    Oh, no, but in any hole we see in the face of a great rock or cliff, and  sometimes right on the top of a rock.    How many eggs?    Only one. That is the reason, you see, that our family remains small.    Sing?    Oh, my, no! We are not singing birds. We have a call-note, though harsh  and guttural, which sounds like _tip, tip, tip_.          THE EUROPEAN KINGFISHER.      Rarely indeed is this charming bird now found in England, where formerly  it could be seen darting hither and thither in most frequented places.  Of late years, according to Dixon, he has been persecuted so greatly,  partly by the collector, who never fails to secure the brilliant  creature for his cabinet at every opportunity, and partly by those who  have an inherent love for destroying every living object around them.  Gamekeepers, too, are up in arms against him, because of his inordinate  love of preying on the finny tribe. Where the Kingfisher now is seen is  in the most secluded places, the author adds, where the trout streams  murmur through the silent woods, but seldom trod by the foot of man; or  in the wooded gullies down which the stream from the mountains far above  rushes and tumbles over the huge rocks, or lies in pools smooth as the  finest mirror.    The Kingfisher is comparatively a silent bird, though he sometimes  utters a few harsh notes as he flies swift as a meteor through the  wooded glades. You not unfrequently flush the Kingfisher from the holes  in the banks, and amongst the brambles skirting the stream. He roosts at  night in holes, usually the nesting cavity. Sometimes he will alight on  stumps and branches projecting from the water, and sit quiet and  motionless, but on your approach he darts quickly away, often uttering  a feeble _seep, seep_, as he goes.    The habits of the English Kingfisher are identical with those of the  American, though the former is the more brilliant bird in plumage. (See  BIRDS, Vol. I, p. 61.) The ancients had a very absurd idea as to its  nesting habits. They believed that the bird built a floating nest, and  whenever the old bird and her charge were drifted by the winds, as they  floated over the briny deep, the sea remained calm. He was, therefore,  to the ancient mariner, a bird held sacred in the extreme. Even now  these absurd superstitions have not wholly disappeared. For instance,  the nest is said to be made of the fish bones ejected by the bird, while  the real facts are, that they not only nest but roost in holes, and it  must follow that vast quantities of rejected fish bones accumulate, and  on these the eggs are of necessity laid.    These eggs are very beautiful objects, being of a deep pinkish hue,  usually six in number.    The food of the Kingfisher is not composed entirely of fish, the remains  of fresh-water shrimps being found in their stomachs, and doubtless  other animals inhabiting the waters are from time to time devoured.    The English Kingfisher, says Dixon, remains throughout the year, but  numbers perish when the native streams are frozen. There is, perhaps,  not a bird in all the ranks of the feathered gems of equatorial regions,  be it ever so fair, the Humming-bird excepted, that can boast a garb so  lovely as this little creature of the northland. Naturalists assert that  the sun has something to do with the brilliant colors of the birds and  insects of the tropics, but certainly, the Kingfisher is an exception of  the highest kind. Alas, that he has no song to inspire the muse of some  English bard!           [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences.                  EUROPEAN KINGFISHER.

Little Folks:    I shouldn't have liked it one bit if my picture had been left out of  this beautiful book. My cousin, the American Kingfisher, had his in the  February number, and I find he had a good deal to say about himself in  his letter, too.    Fine feathers make fine birds, they say. Well, if that is true, I must  be a very fine bird, for surely my feathers are gay enough to please  anybody--_I_ think.    To see me in all my beauty, you must seek me in my native wood.
