Along both the upper and lower outcrops, elm and hackberry  are especially prominent. Chestnut oak is abundant along the outcrops  and on the rocky slope between them in some situations. Ash grows  abundantly on some upper slopes but there are few growing on the upper  outcrop. On the terrace, elm, ash, hackberry, honey locust,  coffee-tree and black oak are abundant. On the lower slopes grow most  of the blackjack oaks, post oaks, red oaks and mulberries.    Even greater differences in the local aspect of woodland on the  hillsides are caused by slope exposure. On south facing slopes,  especially, the woodland is noticeably different from that in other  situations, and of more xeric aspect. The climax species, _Quercus  Muehlenbergii_, _Q. rubra_, _Q. velutina_ and _Carya ovata_ are almost  totally absent. Such trees as are present are of small to medium size.  They are mostly red elm, American elm, walnut, honey locust,  hackberry, and osage orange, with dogwood (_Cornus Drummondii_) and  plum (_Prunus americanus_) forming dense thickets. Occasional patches  of prairie grasses remain in more exposed situations where they have  not been shaded out. These, together with the small size of most of  the trees, indicate that the south slopes have become wooded rather  recently, and originally were prairie. Nevertheless, the small  remaining groves of blackjack oak and post oak are on slopes that face  south, southeast, or southwest, and probably under original conditions  they occupied these situations, separate from the forests of other  hardwoods. Slopes facing east, west, and north, are more similar in  relative abundance of various kinds of trees, and they do not differ  much from hilltop edges that are wooded. Chestnut oak and hickory are  most abundant on north slopes, and ash occurs mainly on north slopes.

Elm is  almost always the dominant tree, making up from one-fourth to one-half  of the total stand. The other species dominate relatively small areas.  Chestnut oak usually makes up a substantial part of the stand on  hilltops and slopes of north, east, or west exposure. Black oak, red  oak, and walnut may be prominent on the east and west slopes. Walnut  and locust are prominent on south slopes.    Hickory usually has a trunk diameter of less than one foot, and,  therefore, it is not prominent anywhere among the larger trees. Table  2, showing ratios of medium-small trees (more than 6 inches and less  than one foot in trunk diameter) demonstrates that hickory is one of  the more prominent trees on hilltops and on slopes other than those of  south exposure.          Invasion of Fields      In 1948 when the extensive open parts of the Reservation were grazed  and cultivated, small trees were inconspicuous and few. Mature trees,  with trunk diameters of 9 inches to more than two feet, were  distributed over the pastured areas, however, with groves of American  elm, honey locust, and walnut near the edges of the woods, and  occasional scattered trees of these species and of osage orange,  coffee-tree, red haw, hackberry, and ash.

Each year thereafter  the numbers were augmented by new crops of seedlings, but conditions  rapidly became less favorable for their establishment, as the ground  cover of herbaceous vegetation became thicker. The numbers and kinds  of young trees that became established differed markedly in different  situations. The seedlings present in large numbers were those of elm,  honey locust, boxelder, dogwood, walnut, osage orange and crab-apple.  There was none of the climax species--oaks or hickories--in the  sample.

It is not conspicuous unless it  is quite dark. In black fowls it is often so abundant that a part  remains in the skin when the feathers are removed. After the pigment is  deposited in the web of the feather the color is fast. Water does not  affect it, but it fades a little with age and exposure. New plumage  usually contains a great deal of oil, a condition which is most  conspicuous in white birds, to whose plumage the oil gives a creamy  tint. In colored birds the presence of a large amount of oil in feathers  is desirable because it gives greater brilliance to the plumage.    [Illustration: Fig. 2. White Leghorn chicks (ten days old)]    =Growth and molting of feathers.= The first covering of a young bird is  down. The young of birds which nest on the ground have the down covering  when hatched; others acquire it in a few days. In small land birds which  feather quickly, as Leghorn and Hamburg chicks, the largest wing  feathers may have started to grow before the chick leaves the egg. In  most kinds of poultry, however, the young show no signs of feathers for  some days. The down is gradually replaced by small feathers, and these  by larger feathers as the bird grows. As feathers in all stages of  growth are found on the young bird at the same time, it is not known  whether all feathers are molted the same number of times. In cases where  some feathers were marked and watched, or where the colors changed with  the changing feathers, it appeared that after the down three sets of  feathers were grown in succession, the third and last making the adult  plumage of the bird. This coat remains until the following summer or  fall, when it is molted and replaced by a new one.    =Flight.= The habit of flying is objectionable in domestic birds because  it makes them more difficult to control. It has no direct use except in  pigeons kept for flying. There is, however, a very important connection  between development for flying and the value of birds for the table. The  muscles of the wings furnish the greater part of the edible meat of most  birds. The most desirable birds for food purposes are those which have  the wing muscles well developed, yet not quite strong enough to enable  them to fly easily. In such birds the breast meat remains comparatively  soft through life, while in birds that fly well it becomes hard in a  very short time. That is why the breast meat of the pigeon is relatively  tougher in an old bird than the breast meat of a fowl or turkey.    The balance between capacity for flight and neglect to use it, which is  desired in birds grown for the table, is secured by giving them  opportunity to exercise their wings moderately but not for progressive  practice in flying, which would soon enable them to fly easily over the  fences used to confine them. To regulate such exercise the perches for  birds that roost are made low, or in an ascending series in which each  perch after the first is reached from the one below it, while fences are  made so much higher than the distance the bird is accustomed to fly that  the failures of its first efforts to go over them discourage it. Ducks  and geese, which do not roost, flap their wings a great deal, and if  they have room often exercise them by half running and half flying along  the ground.    =Mechanism of the wing.= In its structure and in the muscular power that  moves it, the wing of a bird is a wonderful piece of mechanism. A bird  in flying strikes the air with its wings so rapidly that the movements  cannot be accurately counted. The heron, which is a slow-flying bird,  makes from one hundred twenty to one hundred fifty downward strokes of  its wings a minute. As each downward stroke must be preceded by an  upward stroke, this means that the wings make from two hundred forty to  three hundred separate movements a minute. In such swift-flying birds as  the pigeon the movements of the wings can be distinguished but cannot be  counted. The fastest movements of the wings are not made by the swiftest  fliers. In order to fly at all some land birds with comparatively small  wings have to move them so fast that the movements make a blur and a  whirring noise. The partridge is an illustration of a bird of this  class.    If the supporting surface of the wing of a bird were made of skin, like  the web of the foot of a swimming bird, it would be necessary to fold  the wing for each upward stroke. It is here that the structure of  feathers adapts itself to the rapid action required for movement in the  air. The wing is not one surface but a series of narrow surfaces lapping  in such a manner that they unite to form one broad surface when the  downward stroke is made, and with the upward stroke are separated so  that the air passes between them. Greater power in the downward stroke  and less resistance in the upward stroke are also secured by the  curvature of the wing. The under side is concave, the upper side convex.  Thus in the downward stroke the wing gathers the air under it and so  increases the pressure, while in the upward stroke it scatters the air  and reduces the pressure.    If the wing were equally rigid throughout, the movement of the bird  would be mostly upward. The bird in flying moves forward because the  front of the wing is rigid and the tips of the feathers, which are  directed backward, are flexible. So the air compressed by the wing in  the downward stroke escapes backward, and in doing so propels the bird  forward. The principle is the same that is applied in the screw  propeller of a boat or an airship, except that the wing vibrates while  the propeller revolves.    The most important function of the tail in flight is to balance the  bird. It is of some assistance in steering, but a bird steers its course  mostly by manipulation of the wings.    =Scratching.= With the exception of the aquatic birds and the ostrich,  all the species of poultry belong to the group called by naturalists  _Rasores_ or _Scratchers_. Birds of this class have legs of moderate  length and very strong, with toes terminating in a stout claw. Normally  they have three toes upon which the foot rests when they are standing on  a flat surface, and a fourth toe, like a thumb, which assists the other  toes to grasp a perch. Some individual birds and some races of birds  have the fourth or hind toe double. The leg of a bird is so constructed  that when it is bent as the bird sits on a narrow support the toes  contract and grasp the support and hold it without any effort on the  part of the bird. Thus the bird is as secure in its position on a limb  when asleep as if wide awake and looking out for itself.    In proportion to their ability to scratch, birds are able to find seeds  and insects concealed among dead or living vegetation on the surface of  the ground, and also to dig below the surface. Scratching capacity is  most highly developed in the fowl. Compared to it the other land birds  are very feeble scratchers, and do little damage by scratching if free  to roam about. For ages the scratching propensity of fowls was regarded  as a vice in them, but since people began to give special attention to  poultry they have learned that fowls are much more contented and thrifty  in confinement if their food is given them in a litter of leaves, straw,  or shavings, in which they must scratch for it, and have also found that  to some extent fowls may be used to cultivate crops while destroying  insects and weeds among them.    =Swimming.= Capacity for swimming has an economic value in domestic  birds because it adapts those possessing it to places which land birds  rarely frequent. It will be shown when the different kinds of aquatic  birds are described that each has its special place and use in  domestication.    The swimming faculty in these birds is of further interest because of  its relation to the development of the body plumage. If a land bird is  placed in the water, the feathers are quickly saturated, the water  penetrating to the skin. A duck or other swimming bird will remain in  the water for hours without the water penetrating the feathers. This is  commonly supposed to be due to the presence of a large amount of oil in  the feathers, but the difference in the oiliness of the feathers of  fowls and of ducks is not great enough to account for the difference in  resistance to the penetration of water. The peculiar quality of the  plumage of swimming birds is its density. If you take up a fowl and  examine the plumage you will find that it is easy to part the feathers  so that the skin can be seen. It may be done with the fingers, or even  by blowing gently among the feathers with the mouth. Now try to separate  the feathers of a duck so that the skin will be visible. You find it  much harder, because the feathers are so thick and soft and at the same  time so elastic. The familiar phrase \"like water from a duck's back\" is  not especially appropriate. The feathers on the back of most birds are a  very effective protection against rain. The feathers all over a duck are  such poor conductors of water that it is hard to remove them by  scalding. The structure of the plumage of swimming birds adds to their  buoyancy in the water. They do not have to exert themselves to remain on  the surface, but float like cork.    =Foods and mode of digestion.= All kinds of poultry and most of our  common wild birds are omnivorous eaters, but the proportion of different  foods usually taken is not the same in different kinds of birds. Some  eat mostly grains, some mostly animal foods. Some can subsist entirely  on grass if they can get it in a tender state; others eat very little  grass. The scratching birds like a diet of about equal parts of grain,  leaves, and insects. Pigeons and canaries live almost entirely on grains  and seeds, but like a little green stuff occasionally.    Domestic birds which produce many eggs require special supplies of"]]]
