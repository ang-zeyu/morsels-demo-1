She's a  cr-r-eature,\" said Phyllis emphatically.    This was a blow to me. I had always looked on Pamela as a well-drawn  character, and a very attractive, kittenish little thing at that. That  scene between her and the curate in the conservatory ... And when she  talks to Arthur at the meet of the Blankshires ... I was sorry she did  not like Pamela. Somehow it lowered Pamela in my estimation.    \"But I like Arthur,\" said the girl.    This was better. A good chap, Arthur,--a very complete and thoughtful  study of myself. If she liked Arthur, why, then it followed ... but  what was the use? I should never get a chance of speaking to her. We  were divided by a great gulf of Aunties and Alberts and meat sandwiches.    The train was beginning to slow down. Signs of returning animation  began to be noticeable among the sleepers. Aunty's eyes opened, stared  vacantly round, closed, and reopened. The niece woke, and started  instantly to attack a sausage roll. Albert and Ukridge slumbered on.    A whistle from the engine, and the train drew up at a station. Looking  out, I saw that it was Yeovil. There was a general exodus. Aunty became  instantly a thing of dash and electricity, collected parcels, shook  Albert, replied to his thrusts with repartee, and finally heading a  stampede out of the door.    The Irishman and his daughter also rose, and got out. I watched them  leave stoically. It would have been too much to expect that they should  be going any further.    \"Where are we?\" said Ukridge sleepily. \"Yeovil? Not far now. I tell you  what it is, old horse, I could do with a drink.\"    With that remark he closed his eyes again, and returned to his  slumbers. And, as he did so, my eye, roving discontentedly over the  carriage, was caught by something lying in the far corner. It was \"The  Manoeuvres of Arthur.\" The girl had left it behind.    I suppose what follows shows the vanity that obsesses young authors. It  did not even present itself to me as a tenable theory that the book  might have been left behind on purpose, as being of no further use to  the owner. It only occurred to me that, if I did not act swiftly, the  poor girl would suffer a loss beside which the loss of a purse or  vanity-case were trivial.    Five seconds later I was on the platform.    \"Excuse me,\" I said, \"I think...?\"    \"Oh, thank you so much,\" said the girl.    I made my way back to the carriage, and lit my pipe in a glow of  emotion.    \"They are blue,\" I said to my immortal soul. \"A wonderful, deep, soft,  heavenly blue, like the sea at noonday.\"        CHAPTER IV    THE ARRIVAL    From Axminster to Combe Regis the line runs through country as  attractive as any that can be found in the island, and the train, as if  in appreciation of this fact, does not hurry over the journey. It was  late afternoon by the time we reached our destination.    The arrangements for the carrying of luggage at Combe Regis border on  the primitive. Boxes are left on the platform, and later, when he  thinks of it, a carrier looks in and conveys them into the valley and  up the hill on the opposite side to the address written on the labels.  The owner walks. Combe Regis is not a place for the halt and maimed.    Ukridge led us in the direction of the farm, which lay across the  valley, looking through woods to the sea. The place was visible from  the station, from which, indeed, standing as it did on the top of a  hill, the view was extensive.    Half-way up the slope on the other side of the valley we left the road  and made our way across a spongy field, Ukridge explaining that this  was a short cut. We climbed through a hedge, crossed a stream and  another field, and after negotiating a difficult bank, topped with  barbed wire, found ourselves in a garden.    Ukridge mopped his forehead, and restored his pince-nez to their  original position from which the passage of the barbed wire had  dislodged them.    \"This is the place,\" he said. \"We've come in by the back way. Saves  time. Tired, Millie?\"    \"A little, dear. I should like some tea.\"    \"Same here,\" I agreed.    \"That'll be all right,\" said Ukridge. \"A most competent man of the name  of Beale and his wife are in charge at present. I wrote to them telling  them that we were coming to-day. They will be ready for us. That's the  way to do things, Garny old horse. Quiet efficiency. Perfect  organisation.\"    We were at the front door by this time. Ukridge rang the bell. The  noise echoed through the house, but there was no answering footsteps.  He rang again. There is no mistaking the note of a bell in an empty  house. It was plain that the competent man and his wife were out.    \"Now what?\" I said.    Mrs. Ukridge looked at her husband with calm confidence.    \"This,\" said Ukridge, leaning against the door and endeavouring to  button his collar at the back, \"reminds me of an afternoon in the  Argentine. Two other cheery sportsmen and myself tried for  three-quarters of an hour to get into an empty house where there looked  as if there might be something to drink, and we'd just got the door  open when the owner turned up from behind a tree with a shot-gun. It  was a little difficult to explain. As a matter of fact, we never did  what you might call really thresh the matter out thoroughly in all its  aspects, and you'd be surprised what a devil of a time it takes to pick  buck-shot out of a fellow. There was a dog, too.\"    He broke off, musing dreamily on the happy past, and at this moment  history partially repeated itself. From the other side of the door came  a dissatisfied whine, followed by a short bark.    \"Hullo,\" said Ukridge, \"Beale has a dog.\" He frowned, annoyed. \"What  right,\" he added in an aggrieved tone, \"has a beastly mongrel,  belonging to a man I employ, to keep me out of my own house? It's a  little hard. Here am I, slaving day and night to support Beale, and  when I try to get into my own house his infernal dog barks at me. Upon  my Sam it's hard!\" He brooded for a moment on the injustice of things.  \"Here, let me get to the keyhole. I'll reason with the brute.\"    He put his mouth to the keyhole and roared \"Goo' dog!\" through it.  Instantly the door shook as some heavy object hurled itself against it.  The barking rang through the house.    \"Come round to the back,\" said Ukridge, giving up the idea of  conciliation, \"we'll get in through the kitchen window.\"    The kitchen window proved to be insecurely latched. Ukridge threw it  open and we climbed in. The dog, hearing the noise, raced back along  the passage and flung himself at the door, scratching at the panels.  Ukridge listened with growing indignation.    \"Millie, you know how to light a fire. Garnet and I will be collecting  cups and things. When that scoundrel Beale arrives I shall tear him  limb from limb. Deserting us like this! The man must be a thorough  fraud. He told me he was an old soldier. If that's the sort of  discipline they used to keep in his regiment, thank God, we've got a  Navy! Damn, I've broken a plate. How's the fire getting on, Millie?  I'll chop Beale into little bits. What's that you've got there, Garny  old horse? Tea? Good. Where's the bread? There goes another plate.  Where's Mrs. Beale, too? By Jove, that woman wants killing as much as  her blackguard of a husband. Whoever heard of a cook deliberately  leaving her post on the day when her master and mistress were expected  back? The abandoned woman. Look here, I'll give that dog three minutes,  and if it doesn't stop scratching that door by then, I'll take a  rolling pin and go out and have a heart-to-heart talk with it. It's a  little hard. My own house, and the first thing I find when I arrive is  somebody else's beastly dog scratching holes in the doors and ruining  the expensive paint. Stop it, you brute!\"    The dog's reply was to continue his operations with immense vigour.    Ukridge's eyes gleamed behind their glasses.    \"Give me a good large jug, laddie,\" he said with ominous calm.    He took the largest of the jugs from the dresser and strode with it  into the scullery, whence came a sound of running water. He returned  carrying the jug with both hands, his mien that of a general who sees  his way to a masterstroke of strategy.    \"Garny, old horse,\" he said, \"freeze onto the handle of the door, and,  when I give the word, fling wide the gates. Then watch that animal get  the surprise of a lifetime.\"    I attached myself to the handle as directed. Ukridge gave the word. We  had a momentary vision of an excited dog of the mongrel class framed in  the open doorway, all eyes and teeth; then the passage was occupied by  a spreading pool, and indignant barks from the distance told that the  enemy was thinking the thing over in some safe retreat.    \"Settled _his_ hash,\" said Ukridge complacently. \"Nothing like  resource, Garny my boy. Some men would have gone on letting a good door  be ruined.\"    \"And spoiled the dog for a ha'porth of water,\" I said.    At this moment Mrs. Ukridge announced that the kettle was boiling. Over  a cup of tea Ukridge became the man of business.    \"I wonder when those fowls are going to arrive. They should have been  here to-day. It's a little hard. Here am I, all eagerness and anxiety,  waiting to start an up-to-date chicken farm, and no fowls! I can't run  a chicken farm without fowls. If they don't come to-morrow, I shall get  after those people with a hatchet. There must be no slackness. They  must bustle about. After tea I'll show you the garden, and we'll choose  a place for a fowl-run. To-morrow we must buckle to. Serious work will  begin immediately after breakfast.\"    \"Suppose,\" I said, \"the fowls arrive before we're ready for them?\"    \"Why, then they must wait.\"    \"But you can't keep fowls cooped up indefinitely in a crate.\"    \"Oh, that'll be all right. There's a basement to this house.

I have no evidence to dispute  this suggestion except that _B. musculus_ has more prominent cingular  ridges (or at least vestiges of this lophid condition) than either _B.  kolbi_ or _B. rexroadi_. _B. musculus_ (see page 610) is less of an open  grassland inhabitant than is _B. taylori_. Therefore, both _B. kolbi_  and _B. rexroadi_, because of their poorly developed cingular ridges,  might be expected to have lived in a relatively open grassland habitat.    The relationship of _B. rexroadi_ to fossil species other than _B.  kolbi_ is not clear. Superficially, the former resembles _B. taylori_,  but, owing to the specialized development of the molars of _rexroadi_,  it could hardly have been ancestral to either of the living species. The  resemblance of _B. rexroadi_ to _B. taylori_ may result from each having  occupied the same ecological niche in different periods. The incisors of  _B. rexroadi_, however, are much shorter than those of _B. taylori_ and  suggest somewhat different food habits.    _B. minimus_ seemingly is more closely related to _B. sawrockensis_ and  _B. musculus_ than to the other described species. The development of  the cingular ridges leads one to suspect that _B. minimus_ was the  ancestor of _B. musculus_. _B. minimus_ may have been derived from a  _sawrockensis_-like stock and probably gave rise to _B. musculus_.    Hershkovitz (1955:643-644) suggests that \"... primitive brachydont,  buno-mesolophodont cricetines have survived ... in forested parts of the  range,\" whereas \"... the progressive branch of cricetines with mesoloph  absent or vestigal, has become increasingly specialized for life in open  country and a diet of grasses.\" Species of the genus _Baiomys_ can be  divided into two morphological groups. One group, composed of _B.  sawrockensis_, _B. minimus_, and _B. musculus_, includes those species,  the teeth of which were relatively brachydont and had prominently  developed cingular ridges (ectolophids or mesolophids) or, at least,  showed some development of these ridges. _B. sawrockensis_ probably  lived in semi-wooded to shrubby habitats. According to Hibbard  (1953:409), \"The Saw Rock Canyon fauna lived in that area at a time when  conditions were comparable to the conditions at the time the Rexroad  fauna lived.\" The conditions in which the Rexroad fauna lived are  discussed by Hibbard (1941:95). Presumably, there were at least some  well-wooded situations, and the climate was warm. _B. sawrockensis_  probably inhabited denser vegetation than did _B. minimus_ or than does  _B. musculus_. The teeth of the second group (_B. kolbi_, _B. rexroadi_,  _B. brachygnathus_, and _B. taylori_) lack cingular ridges or have them  much reduced and have more hypsodont molars. The three fossil species  probably inhabited relatively open grassland. This assumption is based  largely on the known habitat of _B. taylori_ (see page 632).    The suggested grouping, based on supposed similarities in niches  inhabited by the extinct species, does not necessarily indicate degree  of relationship. _B. taylori_ probably was not derived from an ancestor  like _B. rexroadi_ or _B. kolbi_, although, in certain characters, the  three species resemble one another. _B. kolbi_ and _B. rexroadi_ were  already specialized in Blancan times, probably for living on grassland.  _B. taylori_ shows only a slight advance in specialization of molar  structures compared to either of the aforementioned species but is  slightly smaller and does have longer and more recurved incisors. If  only morphological criteria of lower jaws were considered, without  recourse to other data derived from the study of many samples of  populations of the living species, time alone might account for the  differences among _B. taylori_, _B. rexroadi_, and _B. kolbi_. The  available evidence (see page 658) suggests, however, that _B. taylori_  was derived from the _B. sawrockensis_-_B. minimus_-_B. musculus_ line.        [Illustration: FIG. 3. Diagram indicating probable relationships         of living and extinct species of pygmy mice.]    _Baiomys_ seems to have undergone little basic evolutionary and  morphological change since Late Pliocene time. According to Simpson  (1945:207), hesperomine rodents as a group have undergone little basic  evolution, and \"The rapid evolution of new genera was more a matter of  segregation of characters in a group with a great variation than of the  origin of significantly new characters.\" Perhaps, the living southern  pygmy mouse retains many basic characteristics of one of the early North  American cricetine-like stocks that emigrated to South America near the  end of the Pliocene epoch. There is much to suggest close relationship  of the pygmy mice to certain species of South American hesperomine  rodents of the genus _Calomys_.          NON-GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION      Non-geographic variation in pygmy mice (variation in a single population  resulting from age, individual, seasonal, and secondary sexual  differences) has been but little studied in the past. Mearns (1907:381)  figured progressive stages of wear on the teeth of _B. taylori_; Osgood  (1909:252) and Blair (1941:380) referred to changes in dentition,  weights, and pelages.    The largest samples available for this study were 47 _B. taylori_ from  the vicinity of Altamira (6 mi. N, 6 mi. W; 5 mi. N, 5 mi. W; 1 mi. S),  Tamaulipas, and 44 _B. musculus_ from El Salvador (1 mi. S Los Planes,  and 1 mi. NW San Salvador--two localities 3 miles apart).      VARIATION WITH AGE    Specimens of both species were segregated into five categories:  Juveniles, young, subadults, adults, and old adults. Juvenal and young  pygmy mice are readily separable from the other three categories;  subadults are less easily distinguished from adults. In order to obtain  an accurate understanding of geographic variation in these mice, only  adults should be used in making taxonomic comparisons.    _Juveniles._--Nestling mice yet unweaned; sutures in cranium  incompletely closed; bony parts of skull fragile; M3 and m3 not erupted  or only partly erupted and not protruding above margins of alveoli.    At birth, juveniles are pink, without pelage except for the mystacial  vibrissae and a few hairs about the eye. Blair (_op. cit._:381) recorded  changes with age in color of the skin of new-born and suckling pygmy  mice. Data obtained by me from three litters born in captivity agree  with his findings. Pygmy mice are weaned when 17 to 24 days old. At that  time, the mice possess a fine, but not dense, dusky-gray fur.    _Young._--Weaned mice; cranium fragile; sutures between frontals and  parietals, interparietal and parietals, basioccipital and basisphenoid,  basisphenoid and presphenoid, premaxillaries and maxillaries widely  open; M3 and m3 erupted beyond margins of their alveoli (molars erupt  from anterior to posterior; M3 and m3, therefore, are last to erupt); in  some specimens, molars slightly worn; pelage still dusky and relatively  fine and sparse.    _Subadults._--Sutures between bones of skull less widely open than in  young; epiphyses of long bones incompletely coalesced to shaft; relative  to length of skull, braincase higher and rostrum shorter than in adults;  all cusps worn, but dentine not occlusally confluent; primary first and  second folds of third upper molars present; primary first fold and major  fold of lower molars visible; pelage a subtle mixture of colors of young  and adult, but resembling most that of adult; molts into postjuvenal  pelage between 46 and 50 days.    _Adults._--Sutures of skull, and those between epiphyses and shaft of  long bones obliterated except that, in some mice, sutures of skull  persist between frontoparietal, and interparietal; cusps of molars so  worn that dentine occlusally confluent; small island of enamel in third  upper and lower molars of some specimens; relative to length of skull,  cranium lower, rostrum longer, and interorbital region narrower than in  subadult; cranium appears to be more flattened dorsoventrally; between  subadult and adult stages, principal growth occurs in basioccipital,  basisphenoid, frontals, and parietals; nasals grow less.    Although all bones of the skull grow in the subadult and early adult  stages (see table 1), the above-named bones grow faster than others and  thus cause the general flattening of the skull, typical of adults  (similar to that reported by Hoffmeister, 1951:7). The body continues to  lengthen, accounting for the increase in total length of the adult (see  table 1). Hind foot, tail and ear, reach their maximum lengths by  subadult stage. Adult pelage has been acquired, and the color is  brighter than in either subadults or old adults.    _Old Adults._--Characterized principally by well-worn molars; only thin  peripheral band of enamel along with slight evidence of any primary or  secondary folds on any teeth remain; all bones of skull coalesced;  epiphyses and shafts of long bones ankylosed; small bony protuberances  on many skulls; pelage usually ragged, tips of the hairs being worn  away; white flecking and spotting not common, but occurs in some adults.
