No help comes,  however, and all you know is that thousands of people are kicking you,  and you are being smothered.    Somebody else seems in trouble, too.  You can hear his faint cries coming  from underneath your bed.  Determining, at all events, to sell your life  dearly, you struggle frantically, hitting out right and left with arms  and legs, and yelling lustily the while, and at last something gives way,  and you find your head in the fresh air.  Two feet off, you dimly observe  a half-dressed ruffian, waiting to kill you, and you are preparing for a  life-and-death struggle with him, when it begins to dawn upon you that  it's Jim.    \"Oh, it's you, is it?\" he says, recognising you at the same moment.    \"Yes,\" you answer, rubbing your eyes; \"what's happened?\"    \"Bally tent's blown down, I think,\" he says.  \"Where's Bill?\"    Then you both raise up your voices and shout for \"Bill!\" and the ground  beneath you heaves and rocks, and the muffled voice that you heard before  replies from out the ruin:    \"Get off my head, can't you?\"    And Bill struggles out, a muddy, trampled wreck, and in an unnecessarily  aggressive mood--he being under the evident belief that the whole thing  has been done on purpose.    In the morning you are all three speechless, owing to having caught  severe colds in the night; you also feel very quarrelsome, and you swear  at each other in hoarse whispers during the whole of breakfast time.    We therefore decided that we would sleep out on fine nights; and hotel  it, and inn it, and pub. it, like respectable folks, when it was wet, or  when we felt inclined for a change.    Montmorency hailed this compromise with much approval.  He does not revel  in romantic solitude.  Give him something noisy; and if a trifle low, so  much the jollier.  To look at Montmorency you would imagine that he was  an angel sent upon the earth, for some reason withheld from mankind, in  the shape of a small fox-terrier.  There is a sort of  Oh-what-a-wicked-world-this-is-and-how-I-wish-I-could-do-something-to-  make-it-better-and-nobler expression about Montmorency that has been  known to bring the tears into the eyes of pious old ladies and gentlemen.    When first he came to live at my expense, I never thought I should be  able to get him to stop long.  I used to sit down and look at him, as he  sat on the rug and looked up at me, and think: \"Oh, that dog will never  live.  He will be snatched up to the bright skies in a chariot, that is  what will happen to him.\"    But, when I had paid for about a dozen chickens that he had killed; and  had dragged him, growling and kicking, by the scruff of his neck, out of  a hundred and fourteen street fights; and had had a dead cat brought  round for my inspection by an irate female, who called me a murderer; and  had been summoned by the man next door but one for having a ferocious dog  at large, that had kept him pinned up in his own tool-shed, afraid to  venture his nose outside the door for over two hours on a cold night; and  had learned that the gardener, unknown to myself, had won thirty  shillings by backing him to kill rats against time, then I began to think  that maybe they'd let him remain on earth for a bit longer, after all.    To hang about a stable, and collect a gang of the most disreputable dogs  to be found in the town, and lead them out to march round the slums to  fight other disreputable dogs, is Montmorency's idea of \"life;\" and so,  as I before observed, he gave to the suggestion of inns, and pubs., and  hotels his most emphatic approbation.    Having thus settled the sleeping arrangements to the satisfaction of all  four of us, the only thing left to discuss was what we should take with  us; and this we had begun to argue, when Harris said he'd had enough  oratory for one night, and proposed that we should go out and have a  smile, saying that he had found a place, round by the square, where you  could really get a drop of Irish worth drinking.    [Picture: Whisky glass] George said he felt thirsty (I never knew George  when he didn't); and, as I had a presentiment that a little whisky, warm,  with a slice of lemon, would do my complaint good, the debate was, by  common assent, adjourned to the following night; and the assembly put on  its hats and went out.          CHAPTER III.      Arrangements settled.--Harris's method of doing work.--How the elderly,  family-man puts up a picture.--George makes a sensible, remark.--Delights  of early morning bathing.--Provisions for getting upset.    So, on the following evening, we again assembled, to discuss and arrange  our plans.  Harris said:    \"Now, the first thing to settle is what to take with us.  Now, you get a  bit of paper and write down, J., and you get the grocery catalogue,  George, and somebody give me a bit of pencil, and then I'll make out a  list.\"    That's Harris all over--so ready to take the burden of everything  himself, and put it on the backs of other people.    He always reminds me of my poor Uncle Podger.  You never saw such a  commotion up and down a house, in all your life, as when my Uncle Podger  undertook to do a job.  A picture would have come home from the  frame-maker's, and be standing in the dining-room, waiting to be put up;  and Aunt Podger would ask what was to be done with it, and Uncle Podger  would say:    \"Oh, you leave that to _me_.  Don't you, any of you, worry yourselves  about that.  _I'll_ do all that.\"    And then he would take off his coat, and begin.  He would send the girl  out for sixpen'orth of nails, and then one of the boys after her to tell  her what size to get; and, from that, he would gradually work down, and  start the whole house.    [Picture: Candle] \"Now you go and get me my hammer, Will,\" he would  shout; \"and you bring me the rule, Tom; and I shall want the step-ladder,  and I had better have a kitchen-chair, too; and, Jim! you run round to  Mr. Goggles, and tell him, 'Pa's kind regards, and hopes his leg's  better; and will he lend him his spirit-level?'  And don't you go, Maria,  because I shall want somebody to hold me the light; and when the girl  comes back, she must go out again for a bit of picture-cord; and  Tom!--where's Tom?--Tom, you come here; I shall want you to hand me up  the picture.\"    And then he would lift up the picture, and drop it, and it would come out  of the frame, and he would try to save the glass, and cut himself; and  then he would spring round the room, looking for his handkerchief.  He  could not find his handkerchief, because it was in the pocket of the coat  he had taken off, and he did not know where he had put the coat, and all  the house had to leave off looking for his tools, and start looking for  his coat; while he would dance round and hinder them.    [Picture: Nails etc.] \"Doesn't anybody in the whole house know where my  coat is?  I never came across such a set in all my life--upon my word I  didn't.  Six of you!--and you can't find a coat that I put down not five  minutes ago!  Well, of all the--\"    Then he'd get up, and find that he had been sitting on it, and would call  out:    \"Oh, you can give it up!  I've found it myself now.  Might just as well  ask the cat to find anything as expect you people to find it.\"    And, when half an hour had been spent in tying up his finger, and a new  glass had been got, and the tools, and the ladder, and the chair, and the  candle had been brought, he would have another go, the whole family,  including the girl and the charwoman, standing round in a semi-circle,  ready to help.  Two people would have to hold the chair, and a third  would help him up on it, and hold him there, and a fourth would hand him  a nail, and a fifth would pass him up the hammer, and he would take hold  of the nail, and drop it.    \"There!\" he would say, in an injured tone, \"now the nail's gone.\"    And we would all have to go down on our knees and grovel for it, while he  would stand on the chair, and grunt, and want to know if he was to be  kept there all the evening.    The nail would be found at last, but by that time he would have lost the  hammer.    \"Where's the hammer?  What did I do with the hammer?  Great heavens!  Seven of you, gaping round there, and you don't know what I did with the  hammer!\"    We would find the hammer for him, and then he would have lost sight of  the mark he had made on the wall, where the nail was to go in, and each  of us had to get up on the chair, beside him, and see if we could find  it; and we would each discover it in a different place, and he would call  us all fools, one after another, and tell us to get down.  And he would  take the rule, and re-measure, and find that he wanted half thirty-one  and three-eighths inches from the corner, and would try to do it in his  head, and go mad.    And we would all try to do it in our heads, and all arrive at different  results, and sneer at one another.  And in the general row, the original  number would be forgotten, and Uncle Podger would have to measure it  again.    He would use a bit of string this time, and at the critical moment, when  the old fool was leaning over the chair at an angle of forty-five, and  trying to reach a point three inches beyond what was possible for him to  reach, the string would slip, and down he would slide on to the piano, a  really fine musical effect being produced by the suddenness with which  his head and body struck all the notes at the same time.    And Aunt Maria would say that she would not allow the children to stand  round and hear such language.    At last, Uncle Podger would get the spot fixed again, and put the point  of the nail on it with his left hand, and take the hammer in his right  hand.  And, with the first blow, he would smash his thumb, and drop the  hammer, with a yell, on somebody's toes.    Aunt Maria would mildly observe that, next time Uncle Podger was going to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30802"],[0,"Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book the First (#4)"],[1,"under in proportion to their rank and fortune,  have also abundant reason, considered merely as clergymen, to be  acquainted with many branches of the law, which are almost peculiar  and appropriated to themselves alone. Such are the laws relating to  advowsons, institutions, and inductions; to simony, and simoniacal  contracts; to uniformity, residence, and pluralities; to tithes and  other ecclesiastical dues; to marriages (more especially of late) and  to a variety of other subjects, which are consigned to the care of  their order by the provisions of particular statutes. To understand  these aright, to discern what is warranted or enjoined, and what is  forbidden by law, demands a sort of legal apprehension; which is no  otherwise to be acquired than by use and a familiar acquaintance with  legal writers.    FOR the gentlemen of the faculty of physic, I must frankly own that I  see no special reason, why they in particular should apply themselves  to the study of the law; unless in common with other gentlemen, and to  complete the character of general and extensive knowlege; a character  which their profession, beyond others, has remarkably deserved. They  will give me leave however to suggest, and that not ludicrously, that  it might frequently be of use to families upon sudden emergencies, if  the physician were acquainted with the doctrine of last wills and  testaments, at least so far as relates to the formal part of their  execution.    BUT those gentlemen who intend to profess the civil and ecclesiastical  laws in the spiritual and maritime courts of this kingdom, are of all  men (next to common lawyers) the most indispensably obliged to apply  themselves seriously to the study of our municipal laws. For the civil  and canon laws, considered with respect to any intrinsic obligation,  have no force or authority in this kingdom; they are no more binding  in England than our laws are binding at Rome. But as far as these  foreign laws, on account of some peculiar propriety, have in some  particular cases, and in some particular courts, been introduced and  allowed by our laws, so far they oblige, and no farther; their  authority being wholly founded upon that permission and adoption. In  which we are not singular in our notions; for even in Holland, where  the imperial law is much cultivated and it's decisions pretty  generally followed, we are informed by Van Leeuwen[i], that, \"it  receives it's force from custom and the consent of the people, either  tacitly or expressly given: for otherwise, he adds, we should no more  be bound by this law, than by that of the Almains, the Franks, the  Saxons, the Goths, the Vandals, and other of the antient nations.\"  Wherefore, in all points in which the different systems depart from  each other, the law of the land takes place of the law of Rome,  whether antient or modern, imperial or pontificial. And in those of  our English courts wherein a reception has been allowed to the civil  and canon laws, if either they exceed the bounds of that reception, by  extending themselves to other matters, than are permitted to them; or  if such courts proceed according to the decisions of those laws, in  cases wherein it is controlled by the law of the land, the common law  in either instance both may, and frequently does, prohibit and annul  their proceedings[k]: and it will not be a sufficient excuse for them  to tell the king's courts at Westminster, that their practice is  warranted by the laws of Justinian or Gregory, or is conformable to  the decrees of the Rota or imperial chamber. For which reason it  becomes highly necessary for every civilian and canonist that would  act with safety as a judge, or with prudence and reputation as an  advocate, to know in what cases and how far the English laws have  given sanction to the Roman; in what points the latter are rejected;  and where they are both so intermixed and blended together, as to form  certain supplemental parts of the common law of England, distinguished  by the titles of the king's maritime, the king's military, and the  king's ecclesiastical law. The propriety of which enquiry the  university of Oxford has for more than a century so thoroughly seen,  that in her statutes[l] she appoints, that one of the three questions  to be annually discussed at the act by the jurist-inceptors shall  relate to the common law; subjoining this reason, \"_quia juris civilis  studiosos decet haud imperitos esse juris municipalis, & differentias  exteri patriique juris notas habere_.\" And the statutes[m] of the  university of Cambridge speak expressly to the same effect.    [Footnote i: _Dedicatio corporis juris civilis._ _Edit._ 1663.]    [Footnote k: Hale. Hist. C.L. c. 2. Selden _in Fletam_. 5 Rep.  Caudrey's Case. 2 Inst. 599.]    [Footnote l: _Tit. VII. Sect._ 2. Sec. 2.]    [Footnote m: _Doctor legum mox a doctoratu dabit operam legibus  Angliae, ut non sit imperitus earum legum quas habet sua patria, et  differentias exteri patriique juris noscat._ _Stat._ Eliz. _R._ _c._  14. Cowel. _Institut. in proemio._]    FROM the general use and necessity of some acquaintance with the  common law, the inference were extremely easy, with regard to the  propriety of the present institution, in a place to which gentlemen of  all ranks and degrees resort, as the fountain of all useful knowlege.  But how it has come to pass that a design of this sort has never  before taken place in the university, and the reason why the study of  our laws has in general fallen into disuse, I shall previously proceed  to enquire.    SIR John Fortescue, in his panegyric on the laws of England, (which  was written in the reign of Henry the sixth) puts[n] a very obvious  question in the mouth of the young prince, whom he is exhorting to  apply himself to that branch of learning; \"why the laws of England,  being so good, so fruitful, and so commodious, are not taught in the  universities, as the civil and canon laws are?\" In answer to which he  gives[o] what seems, with due deference be it spoken, a very jejune  and unsatisfactory reason; being in short, that \"as the proceedings at  common law were in his time carried on in three different tongues, the  English, the Latin, and the French, that science must be necessarily  taught in those three several languages; but that in the universities  all sciences were taught in the Latin tongue only; and therefore he  concludes, that they could not be conveniently taught or studied in  our universities.\" But without attempting to examine seriously the  validity of this reason, (the very shadow of which by the wisdom of  your late constitutions is entirely taken away) we perhaps may find  out a better, or at least a more plausible account, why the study of  the municipal laws has been banished from these seats of science, than  what the learned chancellor thought it prudent to give to his royal  pupil.    [Footnote n: _c._ 47.]    [Footnote o: _c._ 48.]    THAT antient collection of unwritten maxims and customs, which is  called the common law, however compounded or from whatever fountains  derived, had subsisted immemorially in this kingdom; and, though  somewhat altered and impaired by the violence of the times, had in  great measure weathered the rude shock of the Norman conquest. This  had endeared it to the people in general, as well because it's  decisions were universally known, as because it was found to be  excellently adapted to the genius of the English nation. In the  knowlege of this law consisted great part of the learning of those  dark ages; it was then taught, says Mr Selden[p], in the monasteries,  _in the universities_, and in the families of the principal nobility.  The clergy in particular, as they then engrossed almost every other  branch of learning, so (like their predecessors the British druids[q])  they were peculiarly remarkable for their proficiency in the study of  the law. _Nullus clericus nisi causidicus_, is the character given of  them soon after the conquest by William of Malmsbury[r]. The judges  therefore were usually created out of the sacred order[s], as was  likewise the case among the Normans[t]; and all the inferior offices  were supplied by the lower clergy, which has occasioned their  successors to be denominated _clerks_ to this day.    [Footnote p: _in Fletam._ 7. 7.]    [Footnote q: Caesar _de bello Gal._ 6. 12.]    [Footnote r: _de gest. reg._ _l._ 4.]    [Footnote s: Dugdale _Orig. jurid._ _c._ 8.]    [Footnote t: _Les juges sont sages personnes & autentiques,--sicome  les archevesques, evesques, les chanoines les eglises cathedraulx, &  les autres personnes qui ont dignitez in saincte eglise; les abbez,  les prieurs conventaulx, & les gouverneurs des eglises, &c._ _Grand  Coustumier_, _ch._ 9.]    BUT the common law of England, being not committed to writing, but  only handed down by tradition, use, and experience, was not so  heartily relished by the foreign clergy; who came over hither in  shoals during the reign of the conqueror and his two sons, and were  utter strangers to our constitution as well as our language. And an  accident, which soon after happened, had nearly completed it's ruin. A  copy of Justinian's pandects, being newly[u] discovered at Amalfi,  soon brought the civil law into vogue all over the west of Europe,  where before it was quite laid aside[w] and in a manner forgotten;  though some traces of it's authority remained in Italy[x] and the  eastern provinces of the empire[y]. This now became in a particular  manner the favourite of the popish clergy, who borrowed the method and  many of the maxims of their canon law from this original. The study of  it was introduced into several universities abroad, particularly that  of Bologna; where exercises were performed, lectures read, and degrees  conferred in this faculty, as in other branches of science: and many  nations on the continent, just then beginning to recover from the  convulsions consequent"]]]
