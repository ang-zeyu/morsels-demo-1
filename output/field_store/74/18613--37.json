Meanwhile his enemy repeats  her thrusts till some thirty or forty eggs, germs of the destroyers, are  safely lodged in his body, and his doom is certain beyond hope. The eggs  quickly hatch into grubs, who begin to gnaw away at the unhappy creature's  flesh, thus reducing him gradually, but by a profound instinct keeping  clear of all the vital organs, as if knowing full well that the creature  must keep on feeding and digesting too, or their own supply would speedily  fail; as usurers, while draining a client, keep up his credit with the  world as long as they can.    Weaker grows the caterpillar as the gnawing worms within grow stronger and  nearer maturity. Sometimes he dies a caterpillar, sometimes he has strength  left to take the chrysalis shape, but out of this he _never_ comes a  butterfly--the consuming grubs now finish vitals and all, turn to pupae in  his empty skin, and come out soon, black flies like their parent.    But, supposing that it has escaped this great danger, we now see the  creature in its completest form, as the    IMAGO, OR PERFECT BUTTERFLY.    The first term, _Imago_, is a Latin one, merely signifying an image, or  distinct unveiled form; as distinguished from the previous _larva_, or  masked state, and the _pupa_, or swathed and enveloped state. The word  _imago_ then, in works on entomology, always means the {20} perfect and  last stage of insect life, and is applied to all insects with wings--for it  must be borne in mind that no insect is ever winged till it reaches the  last stage of its existence.    If the progressive development of these lovely beings is so marvellous, no  less so is their structure when perfected, and of this some general  description must now be attempted.    In contemplating a butterfly, one feels that the mind is first engaged by  that ample spread, and exquisite painting of the wings that form the  creature's glory; let therefore these remarkable organs have our first  attention.    Wherein do these wings chiefly differ from all other insect wings?  Certainly in being covered thickly with a variously coloured powdery  material, easily removed by handling. This apparent dust is composed, in  reality, of a vast number of regularly and beautifully formed  _scales_--feathers they are sometimes called, but they are more comparable  to fish scales than to any other kind of natural covering. The general term  _Lepidoptera_, applied to _all_ butterflies and moths, is derived from  these _scaly-wings_; _Lepis_[2] being the Greek for a _scale_, and _ptera_  meaning _wings_ in the same language.    The use of a tolerably powerful pocket lens will afford _some_ insight into  the exquisite mode of painting    {21} employed in these matchless pieces of decoration; but the possessor of  a regular microscope may, by applying it to some of our commonest  butterflies, open for himself a world of beauty, and feast his eyes on a  combination of refined sculpture with splendour of colouring; now melting  in softest harmony, then relieved by boldest contrast--a spectacle, the  first sight of which seldom fails to call forth expressions of wonderment  and warm delight; and, truly, little to be envied is the mind untouched by  such utter beauty as here displayed.    As an example of the method by which this admirable effect is produced, let  us take a small portion of the wing of the Peacock, a very beautiful,  though an abundant species, and one admirably adapted for microscopic  examination, and to illustrate the subject, from the great variety of rich  tints brought together in a small space, the part selected being the  eye-like spot at the outer corner of each upper wing. Even to the naked eye  this appears as a very splendidly coloured object, yet but little of its  exquisite mechanism can be discovered by the unassisted organ. Something  more is brought out by a moderately strong lens: we then see the colours  disposed in rows, reminding us of the surface of Brussels carpet, or of  certain kinds of tapestry work.    Now let us place the wing on the stage of a good microscope, with the root  of the wing pointing towards the light (that is the best position for it);  we shall then first perceive that the whole surface is covered, or, so to  {22} speak, tiled over with distinct, sharply cut _scales_, arranged as in  fig. 16, Plate II., with the outer or free edges of one row overlapping the  roots of the next. These roots being all planted towards the base of the  wing, if we place that end next the light (as above directed), the free  edges of the scales throw a strong shadow on the next row, which brings out  the imbricated effect most strikingly.    Beginning our observations at the outer edge of the wing, we first notice a  delicate fringe of scales or plumes, more elongated and pointed than the  surface scales, and of a quiet brown colour. This tint is continued inwards  for a short space, gradually lightening, when (as we shift the field of  view towards the centre of the wing) the colour of the scales suddenly  changes to an intense black; then a little further, and the black ground is  all spangled with glittering sapphires, then strewed deep with amethyst  round a heap of whitest pearls. Golden topaz--(jewels only will furnish apt  terms of comparison for these insect gems)--golden topaz ends the bright  many-coloured crescent, and in the centre is enclosed a spot of profoundest  black, gradating into a rich unnameable red, whose velvet depth and  softness contrast deliciously with the adjacent flashing lustre; then comes  another field of velvet black, then more gold, and so on till the gorgeous  picture is complete.    Subject a piece of finest human painting to the scrutiny of a strong  magnifying glass, and where is the beauty thereof? Far from being  magnified, it will have wholly vanished: its cleverest touches turned to  coarse, repulsive daubs and stains.    [Illustration: IV.]    {23}    Now, bring the microscope's most searching powers to bear upon the painting  of an insect's wing, and we find only pictures within pictures as the  powers increase; the very pigments used turn out to be jewels, not rough  uncut stones, but cut and graven gems, bedded in softest velvet.    If by gentle rubbing with the finger-tip the scales be removed from both  sides of the wing (for each side is scale-covered, though generally with a  very different pattern), there remains a transparent membrane like that of  a bee's or fly's wing, tight stretched between stiff branching veins, but  bearing no vestige of its late gay painting, thus showing that the whole of  the colouring resides in the scales, the places occupied by the roots of  the latter being marked by rows of dots.    Hitherto we have been looking at these scales as the component parts of a  picture, like the _tesserae_ of mosaic work; but they are no less  interesting as individual objects, when viewed microscopically. To do this,  delicately rub off a little of the dust or scales with the finger; then  take a slip of glass, and pressing the finger with the adhering dust upon  it, the latter will come off and remain on the glass, which is then to be  placed under the microscope. These scales may be treated either as opaque  or transparent objects, and in both conditions display exceeding beauty,  some of these single atoms showing, by aid of the microscope, as {24} much  complexity of structure as the whole wing does to the unassisted vision.    A few of the highly varied forms they present are shown on Plate II. Figs.  23 to 38 are selected from among the commoner forms, as seen by a  comparatively low power. The small stalk-like appendage is the part by  which the scale is affixed to the wing: it may be called the root. Figs.  17, 18, 19, 20, 21, show some very remarkable forms, which are, so far as  has been ascertained, peculiar to butterflies of the _male_ sex, though the  use or reason of this masculine badge, only visible to highly magnifying  optics, is neither known nor probably to be known at present; but  singularly beautiful and curious they are to look at. The little balls at  the end of threads are the root portion, and fit into cup-like sockets,  placed here and there among the ordinary scales. The surface of these  scales is beautifully ribbed and cross-ribbed, and at the upper end is a  plume-like tuft of delicate filaments. The curious scale aptly called, from  its shape, the Battledore scale, and shown at fig. 22, also belongs to the  male of various butterflies, especially those pretty little ones known as  the \"Blues.\" Its surface is most curiously ornamented with rows of  bead-like prominences.    Probably one would imagine that in such wee specks as are these scales, one  single layer of substance would suffice for their whole thickness (if we  can talk of _thick_ness, with objects almost immeasurable in their  _thin_ness). But such is not the case, for when scales have {25} been  injured by rubbing we now and then find a part with the sculptured surfaces  torn off on each side, showing a plain central layer, so that at least  three layers--two ornamented and one plain--go to form a filmy body, only a  small fraction of the thickness of paper.    But there are other portions of a butterfly to claim our interest besides  its wondrous wings.    On the creature's head are grouped together some most beautiful and  important organs. The most peculiar of these is the long spiral \"sucker,\"  which extracts the honied food from the blossoms to which its wings so  gracefully waft it. This organ is shown, slightly magnified, at fig. 8,  Plate II., and a most delicate piece of animal mechanism it is. Any human  workman would, to a certainty, be not only puzzled, but thoroughly beaten,  in an attempt to construct a tube little thicker than a horse-hair, yet  composed throughout its length of two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33874"],[0,"Wild Bees, Wasps and Ants and Other Stinging Insects (#4)"],[1,"of force. One, a  very rare kind in this country, sets its affection especially on the honey  bee as a prey; the two insects are about equal in size, but the hive bee  must be a dangerous foe to attack, and one would have thought as likely to  sting its captor as its captor would be to sting it; also one would imagine  that a hive bee, unless thoroughly paralyzed, would be a dangerous subject  for a juvenile larva to commence making a meal upon! but whether the  venture ever turns out unsatisfactorily there are no data to show, so far  as I am aware. The larvae must vary very much in their tastes; one can  imagine that a nice juicy caterpillar, or even a good fat grasshopper, may  be appetizing and easily assimilated, but one can equally fancy that the  larvae, who wake up to find their food consisting of small hard beetles,  may feel more or less resentment against their parents' ideas of dainties  for the young! Still they seem to thrive on it, and come out eventually as  exact likenesses of their parents. A large number of the fossors inhabit  dry sandy wastes, such as the dunes along the sea coast at Deal, Lowestoft,  {21} etc.; many of these, when they leave their burrows, throw up some sand  over the hole so as completely to cover it; how these insects find the spot  again after a lengthy chase after spiders or other prey is a marvel; and  yet those who have observed carefully say that they come home from long  distances with unerring precision. No sense of which we have any knowledge,  however accentuated, seems to explain this. To be able to arrive back at a  home in an extensive arid sandy plain, where no outward sign indicates its  whereabouts, must surely require perception of a different nature from any  of those with which we are endowed. Some fossors are subject to the  depredations of cuckoos, just as the solitary bees are, but their cuckoos  are rarely of aculeate origin. The only ones which I have had any  opportunity of studying are the species which nest in bramble stems. The  cuckoos which associate with them are some of the smaller jewel flies and  _Ichneumons_: the habits of both these differ from those of the aculeate  cuckoos, the jewel flies devouring the larva of the aculeate and the  _Ichneumon_ laying its eggs in it. The fossors {22} [Illustration: FIG. 2.]  vary exceedingly in size, shape and colour. Our largest species are about  an inch long and our smallest about the eighth of an inch, nearly all  having the body where it joins the thorax constricted into a very narrow  waist; this is sometimes of considerable length. In one genus known to  entomologists by the name _Ammophila_ (fig. 2) or \"lover of the sand\", the  waist is practically the longest part of the body, so that looking at one  sideways as it flies along, one could almost be deceived into thinking that  there were two insects, one following the other (cf. pl. A, fig. 7). In  colour, there seem to be three dominant schemes: Black (cf. pl. B, fig.  17); black with a red band across the body (cf. pl. A, fig. 7); and black  banded with yellow, like a wasp (cf. pl. A, figs. 6 and 8, etc.) In some  the yellow bands may not be complete, and appear only as spots on each side  of the body segments, or the red band may be almost obliterated, or the  black species may {23} [Illustration: FIG. 3.] [Illustration: FIG. 4.] be  more or less variegated with yellow spots on the head and thorax, but as a  general rule all our species fall into one or other of these colour  schemes. The females of some of our sand frequenting species have beautiful  combs on their front feet, each joint of the tarsi having one or more long  spines on its external side (figs. 3 and 4). These are of importance to  them in their burrowing, as they enable them to move with one kick of their  front leg a considerable amount of the dry sand in which they make their  nests. Although sandy commons, etc., are the resort of many fossors, others  may be found burrowing in wood or in hard pathways or banks; in fact, like  most other insects, some of their members may be found almost anywhere.           *       *       *       *       *    {24}    THE SOLITARY WASPS    The ordinary wasps are acquaintances of every one, but the solitary or  keyhole wasps are not so well known, although they are far from uncommon.  They are little narrow black insects striped across the body with yellow,  belonging to the genus _Odynerus_ (pl. A, 9), and might hardly be  recognized as belonging to the same family as the true or social wasps.  Still they have considerable powers of stinging, and fold their wings  lengthwise when at rest like their larger relatives. I dare say some people  may have noticed that a wasp's wing sometimes assumes a narrow straight  form, quite unlike what it is when expanded. This is due to the wasp being  able to fold its wing lengthwise like a fan. The wasp tribe are, so far as  I know, the only stinging Hymenoptera which have this power.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    They make their nests of mud, etc., in crevices of walls, in banks, in  plant stems, and often {25} in most inconvenient places, such as keyholes,  etc. Some of the solitary wasps have a very curious habit of making a  tubular entrance to their hole. These may sometimes be seen projecting from  sandy banks. The tube is composed of a series of little pellets of mud,  which the wasp by degrees, with the help of its mouth secretions, sticks  together till a sort of openwork curved tube of sometimes an inch long is  formed (fig. 5). This curve is directed downwards, so that the wasp has to  creep up it before reaching the actual orifice of the nest. It looks as if  the first shower of rain would wash the whole structure away, and I have  very little doubt that it often does so. The object of these tubes is  difficult to appreciate. There is a bee on the continent which makes  straight chimneys above its holes, so as to raise the entrance above the  surrounding herbage; possibly these solitary wasps once required {26} their  tubes also for some such purpose, and have continued on truly conservative  lines to build them long after all usefulness has passed away from the  habit; anyhow they are very interesting and beautiful structures. I have  found the tubes of one of our rarer species projecting perpendicularly out  of the level sand, but even then the tubes were curved over at the end, so  that the wasp had to go up and down again before entering its actual hole.  The Rev. F. D. Morice in 1906 found the tubes of the same species in  numbers projecting from the walls of an old stuccoed cottage situated close  to the locality where I found mine, so it is evident that more than one  situation suits its requirements. The solitary wasps provision their cells  with caterpillars, stinging them in the same way as the fossors do. One  very peculiar genus, of one species only in this country, has its body much  narrowed at the waist by reason of the constricted form of the basal  segment; it makes a little round nest of clay which it suspends from a twig  of heather or other plant. This species is rarely met with except on the  heathery commons of Surrey, Hants, Dorset, etc. The {27} solitary wasps are  subject to the attacks of cuckoos belonging to the jewel fly or _Chrysis_  tribe; these behave differently from those belonging to the aculeate  groups, as their larvae do not eat the food laid up for the wasp, but wait  till the wasp larva has finished feeding up, and then devour it. Unlike as  these cuckoos are to their hosts in their brilliant metallic coloration,  etc., they have structural characters curiously like theirs, so that even  here a common parentage in bygone generations may be reasonably suspected.  At present, however, they are placed, except by a few systematists, in  quite distinct families of the Hymenoptera.    In general form these solitary wasps resemble the fossors more than the  bees; they have mostly short tongues (I think all our British ones have),  and their hairs are simple or more or less spirally twisted.           *       *       *       *       *    {28}    THE SOCIAL GROUPS    The social bees are certainly the most highly specialized of the  _Anthophila_, and the social wasps of the _Diploptera_ or insects with  folded wings. The ants occupy a less definite position: they would seem to  be the outcome of specialization among the fossors, only they feed their  young with vegetable juices and not with animal as the latter do. They are  always kept as a separate tribe under the name _Heterogyna_, but for our  purposes the better known word \"ant\" will suffice.    The hive bee and the social wasps are the only British Hymenoptera which  adopt the hexagonal cell-formation in their nests, the bee fashioning its  cells in wax, the wasps and hornet in masticated wood or paper. The  formation of ants' nests is far less regular, being composed of irregular  passages, called galleries, and open spaces, no doubt built on a plan, but  probably {29} in respect of plan no two nests are exactly alike. The humble  bees again differ from either in their nesting habits: the female in the  spring seeks out a mouse's nest or other suitable foundation of moss, etc.,  in or on the surface of the ground, according to the species. This she  lines with wax, deposits a heap of pollen, and lays her eggs in it. She  also makes waxen cells for honey, but these are not hexagonal and  symmetrical as are those of the hive bee, but are more like little pots,  and are known as \"honey pots\".    It must be borne in mind that the economic arrangements of the wasps and  humble bees only last for a single season, whereas those of the ant and  hive bee exist for many years. In consequence of this the swarming habits  belong exclusively to the ants and hive bee. That of the hive bee is well  known to all, and most people must have observed the swarms of male and  female ants which fill the air on some"]]]
