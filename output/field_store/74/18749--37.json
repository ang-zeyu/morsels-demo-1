CHAPTER III    I MAKE ACQUAINTANCE OF MY UNCLE    Presently there came a great rattling of chains and bolts, and the  door was cautiously opened and shut to again behind me as soon as I had  passed.    \"Go into the kitchen and touch naething,\" said the voice; and while the  person of the house set himself to replacing the defences of the door, I  groped my way forward and entered the kitchen.    The fire had burned up fairly bright, and showed me the barest room I  think I ever put my eyes on. Half-a-dozen dishes stood upon the shelves;  the table was laid for supper with a bowl of porridge, a horn spoon, and  a cup of small beer. Besides what I have named, there was not another  thing in that great, stone-vaulted, empty chamber but lockfast chests  arranged along the wall and a corner cupboard with a padlock.    As soon as the last chain was up, the man rejoined me. He was a mean,  stooping, narrow-shouldered, clay-faced creature; and his age might have  been anything between fifty and seventy. His nightcap was of flannel,  and so was the nightgown that he wore, instead of coat and waistcoat,  over his ragged shirt. He was long unshaved; but what most distressed  and even daunted me, he would neither take his eyes away from me nor  look me fairly in the face. What he was, whether by trade or birth, was  more than I could fathom; but he seemed most like an old, unprofitable  serving-man, who should have been left in charge of that big house upon  board wages.    \"Are ye sharp-set?\" he asked, glancing at about the level of my knee.  \"Ye can eat that drop parritch?\"    I said I feared it was his own supper.    \"O,\" said he, \"I can do fine wanting it. I'll take the ale, though, for  it slockens (moistens) my cough.\" He drank the cup about half out, still  keeping an eye upon me as he drank; and then suddenly held out his hand.  \"Let's see the letter,\" said he.    I told him the letter was for Mr. Balfour; not for him.    \"And who do ye think I am?\" says he. \"Give me Alexander's letter.\"    \"You know my father's name?\"    \"It would be strange if I didnae,\" he returned, \"for he was my born  brother; and little as ye seem to like either me or my house, or my good  parritch, I'm your born uncle, Davie, my man, and you my born nephew. So  give us the letter, and sit down and fill your kyte.\"    If I had been some years younger, what with shame, weariness, and  disappointment, I believe I had burst into tears. As it was, I could  find no words, neither black nor white, but handed him the letter, and  sat down to the porridge with as little appetite for meat as ever a  young man had.    Meanwhile, my uncle, stooping over the fire, turned the letter over and  over in his hands.    \"Do ye ken what's in it?\" he asked, suddenly.    \"You see for yourself, sir,\" said I, \"that the seal has not been  broken.\"    \"Ay,\" said he, \"but what brought you here?\"    \"To give the letter,\" said I.    \"No,\" says he, cunningly, \"but ye'll have had some hopes, nae doubt?\"    \"I confess, sir,\" said I, \"when I was told that I had kinsfolk  well-to-do, I did indeed indulge the hope that they might help me in  my life. But I am no beggar; I look for no favours at your hands, and  I want none that are not freely given. For as poor as I appear, I have  friends of my own that will be blithe to help me.\"    \"Hoot-toot!\" said Uncle Ebenezer, \"dinnae fly up in the snuff at me.  We'll agree fine yet. And, Davie, my man, if you're done with that bit  parritch, I could just take a sup of it myself. Ay,\" he continued,  as soon as he had ousted me from the stool and spoon, \"they're fine,  halesome food--they're grand food, parritch.\" He murmured a little grace  to himself and fell to. \"Your father was very fond of his meat, I mind;  he was a hearty, if not a great eater; but as for me, I could never  do mair than pyke at food.\" He took a pull at the small beer, which  probably reminded him of hospitable duties, for his next speech ran  thus: \"If ye're dry ye'll find water behind the door.\"    To this I returned no answer, standing stiffly on my two feet, and  looking down upon my uncle with a mighty angry heart. He, on his part,  continued to eat like a man under some pressure of time, and to throw  out little darting glances now at my shoes and now at my home-spun  stockings. Once only, when he had ventured to look a little higher, our  eyes met; and no thief taken with a hand in a man's pocket could have  shown more lively signals of distress. This set me in a muse, whether  his timidity arose from too long a disuse of any human company; and  whether perhaps, upon a little trial, it might pass off, and my uncle  change into an altogether different man. From this I was awakened by his  sharp voice.    \"Your father's been long dead?\" he asked.    \"Three weeks, sir,\" said I.    \"He was a secret man, Alexander--a secret, silent man,\" he continued.  \"He never said muckle when he was young. He'll never have spoken muckle  of me?\"    \"I never knew, sir, till you told it me yourself, that he had any  brother.\"    \"Dear me, dear me!\" said Ebenezer. \"Nor yet of Shaws, I dare say?\"    \"Not so much as the name, sir,\" said I.    \"To think o' that!\" said he. \"A strange nature of a man!\" For all that,  he seemed singularly satisfied, but whether with himself, or me, or  with this conduct of my father's, was more than I could read. Certainly,  however, he seemed to be outgrowing that distaste, or ill-will, that he  had conceived at first against my person; for presently he jumped up,  came across the room behind me, and hit me a smack upon the shoulder.  \"We'll agree fine yet!\" he cried. \"I'm just as glad I let you in. And  now come awa' to your bed.\"    To my surprise, he lit no lamp or candle, but set forth into the dark  passage, groped his way, breathing deeply, up a flight of steps, and  paused before a door, which he unlocked. I was close upon his heels,  having stumbled after him as best I might; and then he bade me go in,  for that was my chamber. I did as he bid, but paused after a few steps,  and begged a light to go to bed with.    \"Hoot-toot!\" said Uncle Ebenezer, \"there's a fine moon.\"    \"Neither moon nor star, sir, and pit-mirk,\"* said I. \"I cannae see the  bed.\"         * Dark as the pit.    \"Hoot-toot, hoot-toot!\" said he. \"Lights in a house is a thing I dinnae  agree with. I'm unco feared of fires. Good-night to ye, Davie, my man.\"  And before I had time to add a further protest, he pulled the door to,  and I heard him lock me in from the outside.    I did not know whether to laugh or cry. The room was as cold as a well,  and the bed, when I had found my way to it, as damp as a peat-hag; but  by good fortune I had caught up my bundle and my plaid, and rolling  myself in the latter, I lay down upon the floor under lee of the big  bedstead, and fell speedily asleep.    With the first peep of day I opened my eyes, to find myself in a great  chamber, hung with stamped leather, furnished with fine embroidered  furniture, and lit by three fair windows. Ten years ago, or perhaps  twenty, it must have been as pleasant a room to lie down or to awake in  as a man could wish; but damp, dirt, disuse, and the mice and spiders  had done their worst since then. Many of the window-panes, besides, were  broken; and indeed this was so common a feature in that house, that I  believe my uncle must at some time have stood a siege from his indignant  neighbours--perhaps with Jennet Clouston at their head.    Meanwhile the sun was shining outside; and being very cold in that  miserable room, I knocked and shouted till my gaoler came and let me  out. He carried me to the back of the house, where was a draw-well, and  told me to \"wash my face there, if I wanted;\" and when that was done,  I made the best of my own way back to the kitchen, where he had lit the  fire and was making the porridge. The table was laid with two bowls and  two horn spoons, but the same single measure of small beer. Perhaps my  eye rested on this particular with some surprise, and perhaps my uncle  observed it; for he spoke up as if in answer to my thought, asking me if  I would like to drink ale--for so he called it.    I told him such was my habit, but not to put himself about.    \"Na, na,\" said he; \"I'll deny you nothing in reason.\"    He fetched another cup from the shelf; and then, to my great surprise,  instead of drawing more beer, he poured an accurate half from one cup  to the other. There was a kind of nobleness in this that took my breath  away; if my uncle was certainly a miser, he was one of that thorough  breed that goes near to make the vice respectable.    When we had made an end of our meal, my uncle Ebenezer unlocked a  drawer, and drew out of it a clay pipe and a lump of tobacco, from which  he cut one fill before he locked it up again. Then he sat down in the  sun at one of the windows and silently smoked. From time to time his  eyes came coasting round to me, and he shot out one of his questions.  Once it was, \"And your mother?\" and when I had told him that she, too,  was dead, \"Ay, she was a bonnie lassie!\" Then, after another long pause,  \"Whae were these friends o' yours?\"    I told him they were different gentlemen of the name of Campbell;  though, indeed, there was only one, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4210"],[0,"Our War with Spain for Cuba's Freedom (#4)"],[1,"and her child's  throne, whatever sacrifice might be entailed. It was on that same  day that President McKinley presented the ultimatum of the United  States to Spain, in language diplomatic in form, but carrying with  it a definite notice to yield Cuba's freedom and relinquish her  pretense of authority in that island without delay. A copy of the  ultimatum was forwarded to the Spanish ambassador at Washington,  Senor Polo y Bernabe, who responded by asking for his passports  and safe conduct out of the country.    Having reached the point where diplomacy no longer availed, the  Spanish government for the first time made an aggressive move  against the United States. Instead of waiting for the transmission  of the ultimatum by American Minister Stewart L. Woodford, the  ministry forestalled him and dismissed him from Madrid without  affording him an opportunity to present that important document.  It had been transmitted to Madrid by cable from the Spanish  Minister in Washington, and the government felt no need to wait  for formal messages from the enemy's representative in Spain.  Minister Woodford left Madrid without delay, and finally reached  the French frontier, after being subjected to many insults and  attacks upon his train during the journey from the Spanish  capital.    MARTIAL SPIRIT SPREADING.    A wave of national patriotic enthusiasm swept over the United  States. North and South, East and West, there was hardly a  discordant note in the great chorus of fervent applause which rose  when it was understood that at last the forces of the nation were  to be united in the cause of liberty and humanity.    But sentiment could not fight battles, unless backed by material  equipment. The nation was preparing for war. From all parts of the  United States the troops of the regular army were hurried by  special trains southeastward to camps at Chickamauga and Tampa. In  every navy yard work was hurried night and day upon all incomplete  battleships and cruisers. Already the fleets of the American navy  had been concentrated at points of vantage so that little was left  to be done on that score. Congress lost no time in providing the  sinews of war by generous appropriations for the regular channels  of supply, in addition to one passed by unanimous vote of both  houses granting $50,000,000 as a special fund to be at the  disposal of the President. The war appropriation bill and the  naval appropriation bill carried with them emergency clauses.  Preparations were made for the reorganization of the regular army  to more than double its normal size, and the President was  authorized to call for a volunteer army of 125,000 men. Looking to  the future, and the possibility of a long and expensive conflict,  financial measures were prepared which would raise war revenues  through the regular channels of taxation and the issue of bonds.  Americans were ready to put their hands in their pockets and pay  for the privilege of teaching a worthy lesson to the world.    American sense of humor never fails, and even in this period of  stress the people took time to smile over the story of the Spanish  Minister's journey from Washington to Canada. In Toronto, Senor  Polo sought to discredit the assaults that had been made on  Minister Woodford's train in Spain, and related that he himself  had been the victim of assaults at two or three important cities  on his journey through New York, which threatened great danger to  himself and the train on which he was riding.    Upon inquiry it was revealed that the assaults which had aroused  his fear were not quite as hostile as he believed. At the division  stations on the line, the railway employees, according to custom,  passed along the cars, tapping the tires of the wheels with steel  hammers to test them for a possible flaw or break in the wheel,  and it was this that made the Spanish Minister believe that he was  the victim of an American outrage.    FIRST GUNS ARE FIRED.    The United States cruiser Nashville of the North Atlantic  squadron, with headquarters at Key West, had the honor of firing  the first shot in our war with Spain.    Early on the morning of Friday, April 22, the American fleet  sailed from Key West, and, steaming southward across the straits  of Florida, came in sight of Havana and the frowning  fortifications of Morro Castle before six o'clock the same  afternoon.    The sailing of the fleet, as dawn was creeping over the Florida  keys, was a beautiful sight and a significant one, for from the  time the first signals were hoisted until many days after, there  was hardly an hour of inactivity. It was at three o'clock in the  morning that the signal lights began to flash from the New York,  Admiral Sampson's flagship. Answering signals appeared on the  warships all along the line, and in a few moments black smoke  began to belch from the funnels of all the ships and the crews  woke from quietness to activity.    As soon as day began to break, the cruisers and gunboats inside  the harbor hoisted anchors and moved out to join the big  battleships which were already lined outside the bar. At five  o'clock, when all the fleet were gathered around the battleships,  Captain Sampson signaled from the New York to go ahead. The  formation of the line had been agreed upon some time before and  each vessel was in position for line of battle, the New York in  the center and the Iowa and Indiana on either beam. The ships  presented a most beautiful appearance as they swept out on the  ocean without a vestige of anything not absolutely necessary on  the decks. They were stripped of all useless superstructure,  awnings, gun-covers and everything that goes to adorn a ship.  Officers paced the bridge, marines were drawn up on deck and every  man was at his post. They appeared as they were, grim fighting  machines, not naval vessels out on cruise nor a squadron of  evolution and maneuver, but warships out for business.    FIRST SPANISH SHIP CAPTURED.    The fleet had proceeded twelve miles from Sand Key Light, which  lies seven miles southeast of Key West, when the Nashville  signaled the flagship that a vessel flying the Spanish colors had  been sighted. Admiral Sampson signaled from the New York for the  Nashville to go and take it. The Nashville bore down on the  Spanish ship and fired a blank shot from the port guns aft. This  did not stop the Spaniard, and, to give a more definite hint, a  solid shot was fired close over its bows. The Spanish ship  immediately hove to and waited to know its fate.    The vessel proved to be the Buena Ventura, with a crew of about  thirty men, bound from Pascagonla to Rotterdam with a cargo of  lumber, cattle and miscellaneous freight. As soon as possible a  boat was lowered from the Nashville and an officer was sent aboard  the Buena Ventura. When the Spanish captain was informed that his  ship could not proceed, he took his capture gracefully, shrugged  his shoulders, and said he supposed it was only the fortune of  war. It was suggested to him that the capture of a ship bearing  that name, which, translated, means \"good fortune,\" as the first  prize of the American fleet in the war, seemed to be a striking  coincidence. A prize crew of marines under Ensign T. P. Magruder  was placed aboard, and, with the Nashville in the lead, both ships  set out for Key West.    Inasmuch as the Buena Ventura was the first capture by the  American navy in the war, it had a more definite interest than a  success of the same sort would have a few months later. The first  shot was fired by Gunner Michael Mallia of the Nashville, who  therefore has the distinction of firing the first shot in the war.  The prize was a rich one, estimated to be worth, including vessel  and cargo, nearly $500,000, and the prize money resulting became a  tempting amount. Captain Washburne Maynard, commander of the  Nashville, who gained the distinction of making the first capture,  is a native of Knoxville, Tenn. He is a son of former United  States Senator Horace Maynard, and at the time of the capture was  about fifty years old. He entered the Annapolis Naval Academy at  the age of seventeen and graduated at the head of his class. He  was for a number of years stationed in Alaska, and at the time of  gaining his present distinction had been in command of the  Nashville for four years.    BLOCKADE OF HAVANA BEGUN.    After the Nashville left the fleet to return to Key West with its  prize, the remaining vessels of the squadron steamed onward toward  the Cuban coast. Coming within fifteen miles of Morro Castle, the  fleet scattered in a more open line of battle, some of the vessels  turning to the east and others to the west, and making the  blockade of the port complete. No ship could enter or leave the  harbor, and every day brought new prizes to the vessels of the  blockading squadron.    The blockade of the Cuban metropolis was well in progress by the  time the formal notification of it was issued. The President  issued warning to the nations of the world that the Cuban ports  were sealed by the authority of the United States, in the  following formal proclamation:    BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A PROCLAMATION.    Whereas, By a joint resolution passed by the Congress and approved  April 20, 1898, and communicated to the government of Spain, it was  demanded that said government at once relinquish its authority and  government in the island of Cuba, and withdraw its land and naval  forces from Cuba and Cuban waters; and the President of the United  States was directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval  forces of the United States and to call into the actual service of  the United States the militia of the several States to such extent  as might be necessary to carry said resolution into effect; and    Whereas, In carrying into effect this resolution the President of  the United States deems it necessary to set on foot and maintain a  blockade "]]]
