[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38189"],[0,"A Treatise on Sheep: (#4)"],[1,"of the most common domesticated breeds of sheep and goats, tends to  confirm the broad distinctions drawn between them, yet these  differences almost entirely disappear, when we attempt to define the  characteristics of those races, which still exist in a wild state in  various parts of both Continents, where it is so far impossible to  determine the precise division to which they belong, that Cuvier holds  them unworthy of a generic separation. Sheep and goats, in fact, agree  in so many points as regards structure, form, stature, and habit, that  were it not that sheep, according to that naturalist, have \"their  horns directed backwards, returning more or less forwards in a spiral  manner, with a generally convex line of profile, and no beard,\" while  the goats have \"their horns directed upwards and backwards, their  chins generally decorated with a long beard, and their line of profile  almost always concave,\" there would hardly exist a difference worth  the noting. Some writers place great reliance on the differences  indicated by the different coverings of the animals, ascribing wool to  the sheep, and hair to the goat, forgetting that most of the wild  sheep, and some of the domesticated races, are covered with hair,  while some goats, as those of Thibet and Angora, are remarkable for  the fineness of their wool. Even supposing these distinctions to hold  good, we have still to combat the fact, that _sheep and goats produce  mongrels capable of reproduction_, a consideration sufficient of  itself to prove, that the sheep and goat can never be made to form the  types of separate genera.[2]            [2] For further information on this subject, see that          excellent paper on the Natural History of the Sheep and Goat,          by James Wilson, Esq. in No. IX. of the Quarterly Journal of          Agriculture.    (19.) _Horns of Sheep._--As the Chevrotains or Musks are distinguished,  with the Camels, from other animals of this order by the absence of  horns, so are sheep, oxen, goats, and antelopes, distinguished from  the rest of the horned genera of the order, by the persistence of  their frontal prolongations. The horn is an elastic sheath of  _agglutinated hairs_, which appears within the first twelve months,  though sometimes present at birth, and increases by layers, one being  added every year, so that the age of a ram may be known by the number  of rings. The ewes have commonly no horns, but only a protuberance in  place of them. The horn is supported by, and serves to cover, a highly  vascular prolongation of the frontal bone, and it is at its root,  where large vessels, and nervous filaments are entering, that blows  occasion so great agony to the animal, apart from the damage which the  other bones sustain by the infliction of violence on so powerful a  level.    (20.) _Structure of the Stomach._--The term ruminating, indicates the  power possessed by this animal, in common with many others, of  masticating its food a second time, by returning it to the mouth after  a short maceration. This they are enabled to do, from the structure of  the stomachs, or, more correctly speaking, stomach; as anatomists have  now concluded, from all animals being constructed on one common  principle, that ruminating animals are not possessed of four stomachs,  as formerly supposed, but only of one, which they view as being  divided into four compartments. In drawing precise conclusions, we are  bound only to admit the existence of two compartments, the other two  belonging properly to the gullet; and being equivalent to the cheek  pouches of monkeys, or the crop and membranous stomach of birds, may  be viewed as an apparatus designed to serve a nearly similar purpose  (that of moistening and macerating the food); while the real stomach  will cease to excite wonder, or puzzle the ignorant, on being  contrasted with that of other animals, in many of which a division  exists, and from which even the human stomach, though generally a  single sac, is not always exempt,--Dr Knox, of Edinburgh, being in  possession of one that resembles a pair of small globes joined by a  narrow tube, and which, when taken from the body of a person who was  advanced in life, bore every mark of soundness in texture, and must,  therefore, have been congenital.    (21.) _Digestion._[3]--The food descends by the gullet after being  partially crushed, into what is called the first stomach, or paunch,  in Latin, _rumen_, or _ingluvies_, in which cavity are found those  morbid concretions so much, and so superstitiously, prized in the  Eastern world, under the name of Bezoar stones; from this it passes  into the second, termed bonnet, king's hood, or honey-comb, in Latin  _reticulum_, which is much smaller than the other, and receives its  name from the inner coat being arranged into cells; here it is  moistened, made into pellets, and, while the animal is at rest,  impelled by the antiperistaltic motion of the tube to the mouth, and  after undergoing a complete mastication, is returned through the  gullet to the third stomach, or smallest compartment, which goes under  the name of _omasum_, or many-plies, from its resembling a rolled up  hedgehog, and sometimes from the longitudinal _laminae_ of its mucous  membrane that of leaflet. The food remains but a short time in the  omasum, proceeding into the fourth division, or obomasum, which in its  structure, especially in that of the mucous, or inner membrane, is  nearly allied to the same organ in the human being, and is, by the  French, from its power of coagulating milk, called _caillette_. The  last compartment is the largest of the four, so long as the animal  continues to live on milk; but the paunch speedily surpasses it in  magnitude when grass becomes the sole provision. The milk always  passes at once into the fourth stomach, there being no reason why it  should be returned.            [3] See Figs. 2 and 3, Plate I. with their references.    The intestinal canal is long, commencing at the pylorus or lower  opening of the stomach, and averaging from ninety to one hundred feet.  There are but few enlargements in the great intestines. The fat, like  that of all ruminating animals, becomes, on cooling, hard and brittle.    (22.) _Period of Conception._--In this climate, ewes fed on good  pastures admit the ram in August; but September or October is the time  when such would occur if left to nature. They go with young five  months, and in warm climates bring forth thrice a-year; but in  Britain, France, and most of Europe, they do so only once. They give  milk for seven or eight months; live ten or twelve years; and if well  managed, are capable of bringing forth during life, though generally  useless for that process after the seventh or eighth year. The ram  lives from twelve to fourteen years, though instances are recorded of  their enduring till twenty, and becomes unfit for propagating at  eight.    (23.) _Names applied to Sheep._--The age of sheep is never dated from  the time that they are dropped, as that would be attended with many  inconveniences, but from the time that they are first subjected to the  shears, by which means the first year includes a period of at least  fifteen or sixteen months.    The following is a condensed arrangement of the names by which sheep  are designated at different periods of their existence, in various  parts of England and Scotland:--                          _From Birth till Weaning._                   MALE.                           FEMALE.      Tup, Ram lamb, Heeder, Pur.     |  Ewe or Gimmer lamb, Chilver.                         _From Weaning till first Clip._      Hog, Hogget, Hoggerel, Teg.     |  Gimmer hog, Ewe hog, Teg,      Lamb hog, Tup hog, Gridling,  |    Sheeder ewe, Thrave.      and, if castrated, a Wether   |      hog.                          |                         _From first to second Clip._      Shearling, Shear hog, Heeder,   |  Shearing ewe or gimmer,      Diamond or Dinmont ram, or    |    Double-toothed ewe or      tup, and, when castrated, a   |    Teg, Yill gimmer.      Shearing wether.              |                         _From second till third Clip._      Two shear ram, young wedder.    |  Two shear ewe, Counter.                         _From third till fourth Clip._      Three shear ram, old wedder.    |  Three shear ewe, Fronter.    And so on, the name always taking its date from the time of shearing.  Broken-mouthed ewes are called _crones_ in Suffolk and Norfolk;  _kroks_, or _crocks_, in Scotland; and _drapes_ in Lincolnshire. In  Scotland, ewes which are neither with lamb, nor giving milk, are said  to be _eild_, or _yield_.          CHAPTER II.    WOOL.      (24.) _Wool-Bearing Animals._--In most dictionaries wool is defined as  the fleece of sheep, as if, in fact they were the only animals which  yield it, than which nothing can be more erroneous; since we are  assured by the ablest naturalists, that almost every animal, from the  butterfly up to man, possesses more or less of this covering, and that  some indeed rival the sheep in the quantity they bear.    Though wool is possessed in considerable quantity by carnivorous  animals, especially bears, yet the herbivorous quadrupeds, never to  mention the sheep, are principally noticed for its growth, and for  affording a commodity which becomes an article of profit in the hands  of some tribes. Heriot, in his travels through Canada, remarks, that  \"the savage women manufacture thread of the wool of the buffalo, and  weave it into cloth. Most parts of the body are invested with a dusky  wool, which is of a quality extremely fine--is much valued--and can  with great facility be used in manufactures. The quantity usually  contained on one skin is about eight pounds.\"    So far from the sheep being invariably a wool-bearing creature, it  would appear as liable to be entirely destitute of it as some other  animals; for in Tartary, the eastern parts "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#4)"],[1,"of a totem stock are merely  those who gave the first sign of life in the womb at one or other of  certain definite spots. This form of totemism, which may be called  conceptional or local to distinguish it from hereditary totemism, may  with great probability be regarded as the most primitive known to exist  at the present day, since it seems to date from a time when blood  relationship was not yet recognised, and when even the idea of  paternity had not yet presented itself to the savage mind. Moreover, it  is hardly possible that this peculiar form of local totemism, with its  implied ignorance of such a thing as paternity at all, could be derived  from hereditary totemism, whereas it is easy to understand how  hereditary totemism, either in the paternal or in the maternal line,  could be derived from it. Indeed, among the Umbaia and Gnanji tribes we  can see at the present day how the change from local to hereditary  totemism has been effected. These tribes, like the Arunta and Kaitish,  believe that conception is caused by the entrance into a woman of a  spirit who has lived in its disembodied state, along with other spirits  of the same totem, at any one of a number of totem centres scattered  over the country; but, unlike the Arunta and Kaitish, they almost  always assign the father's totem to the child, even though the infant  may have given the first sign of life at a place haunted by spirits of  a different totem. For example, the wife of a snake man may first feel  her womb quickened at a tree haunted by spirits of goshawk people; yet  the child will not be a goshawk but a snake, like its father. The  theory by which the Umbaia and Gnanji reconcile these apparently  inconsistent beliefs is that a spirit of the husband's totem follows  the wife and enters into her wherever an opportunity offers, whereas  spirits of other totems would not think of doing so. In the example  supposed, a snake spirit is thought to have followed up the wife of the  snake man and entered into her at the tree haunted by goshawk spirits,  while the goshawk spirits would refuse to trespass, so to say, on a  snake preserve by quartering themselves in the wife of a snake man.  This theory clearly marks a transition from local to hereditary  totemism in the paternal line. And precisely the same theory could,  MUTATIS MUTANDIS, be employed to effect a change from local to  hereditary totemism in the maternal line; it would only be necessary to  suppose that a pregnant woman is always followed by a spirit of her own  totem, which sooner or later effects a lodgement in her body. For  example, a pregnant woman of the bee totem would always be followed by  a bee spirit, which would enter into her wherever and whenever she felt  her womb quickened, and so the child would be born of her own bee  totem. Thus the local form of totemism, which obtains among the Arunta  and Kaitish tribes, is older than the hereditary form, which is the  ordinary type of totemism in Australia and elsewhere, first, because it  rests on far more archaic conceptions of society and of life; and,  secondly, because both the hereditary kinds of totemism, the paternal  and the maternal, can be derived from it, whereas it can hardly be  derived from either of them.'    This argument appears to take for granted that the conception of primal  ancestral spirits, perpetually reincarnated, is primitive. But, in  fact, we seem to know it, among Australian tribes, only in these which  have advanced to the possession of eight classes, and have made 'the  great step in progress' (if it is a great step), of descent of the  totem in the paternal line. The Urabunna, with female descent of the  totem, have, it is true, the belief in reincarnation. But they  intermarry with the Arunta, borrow their sacred stones, and practise  the same advanced rites and ceremonies. The idea may thus have been  borrowed. On the other hand, the more pristine tribes of the  south-east, with two or four exogamous divisions, and with female  descent of the totem, have no known trace of the doctrine of  reincarnation (except as displayed by the Euahlayi), and have no doubt  that the father is the cause of procreation, save in the case of the  Euahlayi, who believe that the Moon and the Crow 'make' the new  children.    It would thus appear that the central and northern belief in perpetual  reincarnation of primal spirits is not primitive, yet the Arunta method  of acquiring totems does not exist save by grace of this belief, PLUS  the isolated belief in primal sacred stones.    I am obliged to differ from Mr. Frazer when he says that 'it is easy to  see how hereditary totemism, either in the paternal or in the maternal  line, would be derived from' the Arunta belief and practice, whereas  'it is hardly possible that this peculiar form of local totemism  [Arunta], with its implied ignorance of such a thing as paternity at  all, could be derived from hereditary totemism.'    I do not know whether the other northern tribes share the Arunta  nescience of procreation, or not. Whether they do or do not, it was as  easy for them to e plain all difficulties by a reconciling myth--a  spirit of the husband's totem follows his wife--as for a white savant to  frame an hypothesis. The Urabunna, with female descent of the totem,  have quite another myth--to reconcile everything.    Nothing can be more easy. Supposing the Arunta to have begun, as in my  theory, with hereditary totemism, the rise of their isolated belief in  spirit-haunted sacred stones, encroached on and destroyed the  hereditary character of their totemism. The belief in CHURINGA NANJA is  an isolated freak, but it has done its work, while leaving traces of an  earlier state of things, as we have shown, both among the Kaitish and  Arunta.    If I am right in differing from such a master of many legions as the  learned author of THE GOLDEN BOUGH, the irreligion of the Arunta and  northern tribes (if these be really without religion) is the result of  their form of speculation, wholly occupied by the idea of  reincarnation, while the Arunta form of totemism is the consequence of  an isolated fantasy about their peculiar sacred stones. Meanwhile the  Euahlayi, as Mrs. Parker proves, entertain, in a limited way, not  elsewhere recorded in Australia, the belief in the reincarnation of the  souls of uninitiated young people. They also, like the Arunta,  recognise haunted trees and rocks, but the haunting spirits do not  desire reincarnation, and are not ancestral. Spirits of the dead go to  one or other abode of souls, to Baiame, or far from his presence to a  place of pain. So limited is human fancy, that here, as in Beckford's  picture of hell in VATHEK, each spirit eternally presses his hand  against his side. Were this a Christian doctrine, the Euahlayi would be  said to have borrowed it, but few will accuse them of plagiarising from  Beckford. These myths, like all myths, are not consistent. Baiame may  change a soul into a bird.    We may ask whether, with their limited belief in reincarnation, and  with their haunted Minggah trees and rocks, the Euahlayi have set up a  creed which might possibly develop into the northern faith, or whether  they once held the northern faith, and have almost emerged from it.  Without further information about intermediate tribes and their ideas  on these matters, the question cannot be answered. We are also without  data as to whether the nearly extinct southern coastal tribes evolved  the All Father belief, and transmitted it to the Euahlayi, to some  Queensland tribe, with their Mulkari, and even to the Kaitish, or  whether the faith has been independently developed among the tribes  with no matrimonial classes and the others. Conjecture is at present  useless.    In one respect a discovery of Mrs. Parker's is unfavourable to my  theories. In THE SECRET OF THE TOTEM have shown that, when the names of  the phratry divisions of the tribes can be interpreted, they prove to  be names of animals, and I have shown how this may have come to be the  case. But among the Euahlayi the phratry names mean 'light blood' and  'dark blood.' This, PRIMA FACIE, seems to favour the theory of the Rev.  Mr. Mathews, in his EAGLE HAWK AND CROW, that two peoples, lighter and  darker, after an age of war, made CONNUBIUM and marriage treaty, whence  came the phratries. The same author might urge, if he pleased, that  Eagle Hawk (about the colour of the peregrine) was chosen to represent  'light,' and Crow to represent 'dark'; while the phratry animals, White  and Black Cockatoo, were selected, elsewhere, to represent the same  contrast. But we need more information as to the meanings of other  phratry names which have defied translation.    In many other things, as in the account of the YUNBEAI of the Euahlayi,  their mode of removing the tabu on the totem in food, their magic,  their 'multiplex totems,' their methods of hunting, their initiatory  ceremonies, their highly moral lullabies, and the whole of their kindly  life, Mrs. Parker's book appears to deserve a welcome from the few who  care to study the ways of early men, 'the pit whence we were dug.' The  Euahlayi are a sympathetic people, and have found a sympathetic  chronicler.    A. LANG.

The area of my observation is mainly limited to the region occupied by  the Euahlayi tribe of north-western New South Wales, who for twenty  years were my neighbours on the Narran River. I have been acquainted  since childhood with the natives, first in southern South Australia;  next on my father's station on the Darling River, where I was saved by  a native girl, when my sisters were drowned while bathing.
