[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38516"],[0,"The Children's Life of the Bee (#4)"],[1," a great many hours every day at their meals, of  which they take a great number. They appear to be held in high honor by  all who come near them; and have numbers of men and women to wait on  them, to feed them and look after them. It can only be assumed that  these persons must be of the greatest use and service to the country,  but I have so far not been able to discover what this service may be.  There are others who do nothing but work, and work very hard indeed, in  great sheds full of wheels that are always turning round and round, or  in dark and dirty hovels, or on small plots of earth that from sunrise  to sunset they are always digging and delving. It is certain that this  labor must be an offense, and one which is punished. For the persons who  are guilty of it are lodged in wretched little houses, in which there is  absolutely no comfort at all, and very often no light and no air. They  are clothed in some colorless sort of hide. They are so madly fond of  the foolish things they are doing that they scarcely allow themselves  time to eat or to sleep. In numbers they are to the others as a thousand  to one. The curious thing is that, apart from this extraordinary craving  for their work--which would seem to be very tiring--they appear to be  quite gentle and harmless, and satisfied with the leavings of those who  are evidently the guardians, if not the saviors, of the race.\"    Whatever we may think about the intelligence of the bee, we must at  least admire the way in which it sacrifices itself to the one thing it  seems to care for or value--and that is, the future. It is the future of  the race, and that only, which directs the bee's actions, its virtues,  and even its cruelties. That is its ideal, the one thing it lives for;  and where shall we find one that is more sublime, where shall we look  for a self-denial that is braver or more complete?      It is such a logical little republic, this one of the bees; they reason  so clearly, they are so careful and wise; and yet they allow this dream  of theirs, this dream that is so uncertain and full of doubt, to master  them completely. Who shall tell us, oh little people, who are so deeply  in earnest, who have fed on the warmth and the light and on all that is  purest in nature, on the very soul of the flowers, who shall tell us why  you seem to have found the answer to questions that to us are  unanswerable still? Oh little city, so full of faith, and mystery, and  hope, why do your thousands of workers sacrifice themselves so  cheerfully? Another spring, another summer, would be theirs if only they  would not waste their strength so recklessly, if only they would take a  little more care of themselves and not work so dreadfully hard; but at  the wonderful moment when the flowers are calling to them, the bees  forget everything but their work, give themselves up to it  whole-heartedly, passionately; with the result that in less than five  weeks they are worn out, their wings are broken, their bodies shriveled  and covered with wounds.    Why, we ask ourselves, why do they give up their sleep, the delights of  honey, the leisure that their winged brother, the butterfly, enjoys so  gaily? It is not because they are hungry. Two or three flowers will  provide each bee with the nourishment that she requires, and in one hour  she will visit two or three hundred, to gather a treasure whose  sweetness she never will taste. Oh bees, we wonder, why all this toil  and suffering? And the answer is that they aim at one thing only, to  live, as long as the world itself, in those that come after them.      But we are forgetting the hive, where the swarming bees have begun to  lose patience; the hive whose black and trembling waves are bubbling and  overflowing, like melting copper beneath a hot sun. It is noon, and the  heat so great that the trees around appear almost to hold back their  leaves, as we hold our breath when something very solemn and wonderful  is about to happen. The bees give their honey and sweet-smelling wax to  the man who keeps them, but more precious gift still is their summoning  him to the gladness of June, to the joy of the beautiful months; for  events in which bees take part happen only when skies are pure, at the  joyous hours of the year when flowers are brightest. The bees are the  soul of the summer, the clock whose hands are marking the moments of  plenty; they are the untiring wing on which delicate scents are  floating; they are the guide of the quivering sunbeams, the song of the  tranquil, gentle air. To see them in their flight recalls to us the many  simple joys of the quiet hours of summer; as we look at them, we seem to  hear the whisper of the good, kindly heat. To him who has known them and  loved them, a summer where there are no bees becomes as sad and as empty  as one without flowers or birds.      It will startle you just a little, the first time you see the great  swarm of a bee-hive. You will be almost afraid to go near it. You will  wonder, can these be the same friendly, hard-working bees that you have  so often watched in the past? A few minutes ago, perhaps, you may have  seen them flocking in from all parts of the country, as busy as little  housewives, with no thought beyond household cares. You will have  watched them stream into the hive, all out of breath, tired, flurried;  you will have seen the young guards at the gate salute them as they  passed by. They will have rushed through, to the inner court, and have  quickly handed over their harvest of honey to the workers on duty there,  exchanging with these the three or four necessary words; or perhaps they  will have hastened to the great vats near the brood-cells, and will have  emptied the two heavy baskets of honey that hung from their thighs, then  going out again without giving a thought to what might be happening in  the royal palace, the work-rooms, or the nurseries, where the young  bees lie asleep; without for one instant heeding the babble in the  public place in front of the gate, the place where the cleaners, when  the heat is very great, are accustomed to gather and gossip.      But to-day everything is changed. A certain number of workers, it is  true, will quietly go off to the fields, as though nothing were  happening, and will come back, clean the hive, attend to the  brood-cells, and take no part whatever in the general rejoicing. These  bees are the ones who are not going away with the queen. They will  remain to guard the old home, to look after the nine or ten thousand  eggs, the eighteen thousand young bees, and the seven or eight royal  princesses who to-day will be forsaken. The order has been given, and is  faithfully obeyed; and hardly ever will one of these resigned  Cinderellas be found in the giddy throng of the swarm.      And yet, the temptation must seem very great. It is the festival of  honey, the triumph of the race; the one day of joy, of forgetfulness and  light-heartedness, the only Sunday the bees ever know. It seems, too, to  be the one day on which all eat their fill, and revel, to heart's  content, in the treasure which they have amassed. They might be  prisoners freed at last, suddenly led into a land overflowing with  plenty. They cannot contain the joy that is in them. They come and go  without aim or purpose; they depart and return, sally forth again to see  if the queen is ready; they tease and play about with their sisters, and  do anything to pass the time. They fly much higher than usual, and the  leaves of the mighty trees round about are all quivering in reply. The  bees have left all trouble behind, and all care. They no longer are  fierce, suspicious, angry. On this day man can go near them and handle  them, can divide the glittering curtain they form as they fly round and  round in songful circles. He can take them up in his hand, he can gather  them as he would a bunch of grapes; for to-day, in their gladness,  possessing nothing, but full of faith in the future, they will submit to  everything and injure no one, so long as they be not separated from  their queen, on whom that future depends.      But the signal has not yet been given. In the hive there is the  strangest confusion, a disorder which we are unable to understand. At  ordinary times, each bee, as soon as she has returned to the hive,  appears to forget her wings; she will do her work, scarcely making a  movement, on that particular spot in the hive where her special duties  lie. But to-day every bee seems bewitched; they fly in dense circles  round and round the smooth walls, like a living jelly stirred by an  unseen hand. There are times even when the air inside the hive will  become so hot that the wax of which the buildings are made will soften,  and twist out of shape.    The queen, who till now never has stirred from the center of the comb,  is rushing wildly to and fro, in breathless excitement, clambering over  the crowd that keeps on turning and turning. Is she hastening their  departure, or trying to prevent it? Is she commanding or imploring? Is  she the cause of all this emotion, or merely its victim?    There would seem reason to believe that the swarming always takes place  against the wish of the queen. The workers, her daughters, are  extraordinarily good to her, but it is just possible that they have not  much faith in her intelligence. They treat her rather like a mother who  has seen her best days. Their respect for her, their tenderness, is  remarkable, and there is nothing they would not do for her. The purest  honey is kept for her use. She has guardians who watch over her by day  and by night, and get the cells ready in which the eggs are to be laid.  She has loving attendants who pet and fondle her, who feed her and clean  her. Should she meet with the slightest accident, the news will spread  quickly from group to group, and the whole people will rush to and fro  with loud expressions of sorrow.
