Thunder-storms are frequent  and severe, but wind-storms are not commonly of any great violence.    The abundant rainfall maintains a copious flow of water down the many  rivers at all times of the year; but the rivers are liable to rise  rapidly many feet above their normal level during days of exceptionally  heavy rain. In their lower reaches, where they traverse the alluvial  plains and swamps, the rivers wind slowly to the sea with many great  bends, and all the larger ones are navigable by small steamers for  many miles above their mouths: thus a large steam launch can ascend the  Rejang for 160 miles, the Baram for 120, and some of the rivers on the  Dutch side for still greater distances. The limit of such navigation  is set by beds of rock over which the rivers run shallow, and which  mark the beginnings of the middle reaches. In these middle reaches,  where the rivers wind between the feet of the hills, long stretches of  deep smooth water alternate with others in which the water runs with  greater violence between confining walls of rock, or spreads out in  wide rapids over stony bottoms. The upper reaches of the rivers, where  they descend rapidly from the slopes of the mountains, are composed  of long series of shallow rapids and low waterfalls, alternating at  short intervals with still pools and calm shallows, bounded by rock  walls and great beds of waterworn stones, which during the frequent  freshets are submerged by a boiling flood. The whole river in these  upper reaches is for the most part roofed in by the overarching forest.    Practically the whole of Borneo, from the seacoast to the summits of  the highest mountains, is covered with a dense forest. On the summits  this consists of comparatively stunted trees, of which every part is  thickly coated with moss. In all other parts the forest consists of  great trees rising to a height of 150 feet, and even 200 feet, and of a  dense undergrowth of younger and smaller trees, and of a great variety  of creepers, palms, and ferns. Trees of many species (nearly 500)  yield excellent timber, ranging from the hardest ironwood or BILIAN,  and other hard woods (many of them so close-grained that they will not  float in water), to soft, easily worked kinds. A considerable number  bear edible fruits, notably the mango (from which the island derives  its Malay name, PULU KLEMANTAN), the durian, mangosteen, rambutan,  jack fruit, trap, lansat, banana of many varieties, both wild and  cultivated, and numerous sour less nutritious kinds. Wild sago is  abundant in some localities. Various palms supply in their unfolding  leaves a cabbage-like edible. Among edible roots the caladium  is the chief. Rubber is obtained as the sap of a wild creeper;  gutta-percha from trees of several varieties; camphor from pockets  in the stem of the camphor tree (DRYOBALANOPS AROMATICA). But of all  the jungle plants those which play the most important parts in the  life of the people are the many species of the rattan and the bamboo;  without them more than half the crafts and most of the more important  material possessions of the natives would be impossible, and their  lives would perhaps nearly conform to the conventional notion of  savage existence as something 'nasty, dull, and brutish.' The jungle  of Borneo is, of course, famous for its wealth of orchids, and can  claim the distinction of producing the largest flower of the world  (RAFFLESIA), and many beautiful varieties of the pitcher plant.    The forests of Borneo harbour more than 450 species of birds, many  of them being of gorgeous colouring or strange and beautiful forms;  especially noteworthy are many hawks, owls, and eagles, fly-catchers,  spider-hunters, sun-birds, broad-bills, nightjars, orioles, miners,  pigeons, kingfishers, hornbills, trojans, magpies, jays, crows,  partridges, pheasants, herons, bitterns, snipes, plovers, Curlews,  and sandpipers. Amongst these are many species peculiar to Borneo;  while on the mountains above the 4000-feet level are found several  species which outside Borneo are known only in the Himalayas.    Besides the mammals mentioned above, Borneo claims several species  of mammal peculiar to itself, notably the long-nosed monkey (NASALIS  LARVATUS); two species of ape (SEMNOPITHECUS HOSEI and S. CRUCIGER);  many shrews and squirrels, including several flying species; a  civet-cat (HEMIGALE HOSEI); a deer (CERVUS BROOKII); the bearded pig  (SUS HARBATUS); the curious feather-tailed shrew (PTYLOCERCUS LOWII).    Reptiles are well represented by the crocodile, which abounds in all  the rivers, a long-snouted gavial, numerous tortoises and lizards  with several flying species, and more than seventy species of snakes,  of which some are poisonous, while the biggest, the python, attains  a length of thirty feet. The rivers abound in edible fish of many  species; insects are of course numerous and varied, and, aided by the  multitude of frogs, they fill the island each evening at sunset with  one vast chorus of sound.        CHAPTER 2    History of Borneo    The Pagan tribes of Borneo have no written records of their history  and only very vague traditions concerning events in the lives of their  ancestors of more than five or six generations ago. But the written  records of more cultured peoples of the Far East contain references to  Borneo which throw some small rays of light upon the past history and  present condition of its population. It has seemed to us worth while  to bring together in these pages these few historical notes. The later  history of Borneo, which is in the main the story of its occupation  by and division between the Dutch and English, and especially the  romantic history of the acquisition of the raj of Sarawak by its  first English rajah, Sir James Brooke, has often been told,[3] and  for this reason may be dismissed by us in a very few words.    The coasts of Borneo have long been occupied by a Mohammedan population  of Malay culture; this population is partly descended from Malay  and Arab immigrants, and partly from indigenous individuals and  communities that have adopted the Malay faith and culture in recent  centuries. When Europeans first visited the island, this population,  dwelling for the most part, as it still does, in villages and small  towns upon the coast and in or near the mouths of the rivers, owed  allegiance to several Malay sultans and a number of subordinate rulers,  the local rajahs and pangirans. The principal sultans had as their  capitals, from which they took their titles, Bruni on the north-west,  Sambas in the west, Pontianak at the mouth of the Kapuas river,  Banjermasin in the south at the mouth of the river of the same name,  Pasir at the south-east corner, Kotei and Balungan on the east at the  mouths of the rivers of those names; while the Sultan of Jolo, the  capital of the Sulu islands, which lie off the north coast, claimed  sovereignty over the northern end of Borneo. But these Malay sultans  were not the first representatives in the island of culture and of  civilised or semi-civilised rule; for history preserves some faint  records of still earlier times, of which some slight confirmation is  afforded by surviving traces of the culture then introduced.    In spite of all the work done on the history of the East Indies,  most of what occurred before and much that followed the arrival of  Europeans remains obscure. There are several Asiatic nations whose  records might be expected to contain valuable information, but all  are disappointing. The Klings, still the principal Hindu traders  in the Far East, visited the Malay Archipelago in the first or at  any rate the second century after Christ,[4] and introduced their  writing[5] and chronology. But their early histories are meagre  and unsatisfactory in the extreme. The Arab culture of the Malays,  which took root in Sumatra in the twelfth century, is of course of  no assistance in regard to events of earlier date, and does not give  trustworthy and detailed accounts until the fifteenth century. The  Chinese, on the other hand, always a literary people, carefully  preserved in their archives all that could be gathered with regard  to the \"southern seas.\" But China was far away, and many local events  would possess no interest for her subjects. Under the circumstances,  the official historians deserve our gratitude for their geographical  descriptions and for the particulars of tribute-bearing missions to  the Son of Heaven, though they have little else to tell.    The first account we have been able to find referring to Borneo is  a description of the kingdom of Poli from the Chinese annals of the  sixth century. Poli was said to be on an island in the sea south-east  of Camboja, and two months south-east of Canton. The journey thither  was made by way of the Malay Peninsula, a devious route still followed  by Chinese junks. Envoys were sent to the Imperial court in A.D. 518,  523, and 616. \"The people of this country,\" our authority says,  \"are skilled in throwing a discus-knife, and the edge is like a saw;  when they throw it at a man, they never fail to hit him. Their other  arms are about the same as in China. Their customs resemble those  of Camboja, and the productions of the country are the same as of  Siam. When one commits a murder or theft they cut off his hands,[6]  and when adultery has been committed, the culprit has his legs chained  for the period of a year. For their sacrifice they choose the time when  there is no moon; they fill a bowl with wine and eatables and let it  float away on the surface of the water; in the eleventh month they have  a great sacrifice. They get corals from the sea, and they have a bird  called s'ari, which can talk.\" A later reference to the same place  says: \"They carry the teeth of wild beasts in their ears, and wrap  a piece of cotton round"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3310"],[0,"A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A Contribution to the History of India (#4)"],[1,"of Delhi.\"[18]  He also held Gujarat firmly. If, therefore, we venture to correct  Nuniz in this respect, and say that \"Togao Mamede\" made war on the  \"Dakhan\" instead of on \"Gujarat,\" and then advanced against Anegundi  (wrongly called \"Vijayanagar,\" which place was not as yet founded)  we shall probably be not far from the truth. The history of \"Togao  Mamede\" so far is the history of Muhammad Taghlaq.    Then as to the extraordinary stories told of him. True or not, they  apply to that sovereign. Muhammad is described by contemporary writers  as having been one of the wonders of the age. He was very liberal,  especially to those learned in the arts. He established hospitals  for the sick and alm-houses for widows and orphans. He was the most  eloquent and accomplished prince of his time. He was skilled in many  sciences, such as physic, logic, astronomy, and mathematics. He  studied the philosophies and metaphysics of Greece, and was very  strict in religious observances.    \"But,\" continues Firishtah, from whom the above summary is taken,  \"with all these admirable qualities he was wholly devoid of mercy  or consideration for his people. The punishments he inflicted were  not only rigid and cruel, but frequently unjust. So little did he  hesitate to spill the blood of God's creatures that when anything  occurred which excited him to proceed to that horrid extremity, one  might have supposed his object was to exterminate the human species  altogether. No single week passed without his having put to death  one or more of the learned and holy men who surrounded him, or some  of the secretaries who attended him.\"    The slightest opposition to his will drove him into almost insane  fury, and in these fits he allowed his natural ferocity full play. His  whole life was spent in visionary schemes pursued by means equally  irrational. He began by distributing enormous sums of money amongst  his nobles, spending, so it is said, in one day as much as [pound  sterling]500,000. He bought off the invading Moghuls by immense  payments instead of repelling them by force of arms. Shortly after  this he raised a huge army for the conquest of Persia, his cavalry,  according to Firishtah, numbering 370,000 men. But nothing came  of it except that the troops, not receiving their pay, dispersed  and pillaged the country. Then he decided to try and conquer China  and sent 100,000 men into the Himalayas, where almost all of them  miserably perished; and when the survivors returned in despair the king  put them all to death. He tried to introduce a depreciated currency  into his territories as a means to wealth, issuing copper tokens for  gold, which resulted in entire loss of credit and a standstill of  trade. This failing to fill the treasury he next destroyed agriculture  by intolerable exactions; the husbandmen abandoned their fields and  took to robbery as a trade, and whole tracts became depopulated,  the survivors living in the utmost starvation and misery and being  despoiled of all that they possessed. Muhammad exterminated whole  tribes as if they had been vermin. Incensed at the refusal of  the inhabitants of a certain harassed tract to pay the inordinate  demands of his subordinates, he ordered out his army as if for a hunt,  surrounded an extensive tract of country, closed the circle towards  the centre, and slaughtered every living soul found therein. This  amusement was repeated more than once, and on a subsequent occasion  he ordered a general massacre of all the inhabitants of the old  Hindu city of Kanauj.[19] These horrors led of course to famine,  and the miseries of the Hindus exceeded all power of description. On  his return from Devagiri on one occasion he caused a tooth which he  had lost to be interred in a magnificent stone mausoleum, which is  still in existence at Bhir.    But perhaps the best known of his inhuman eccentricities was his  treatment of the inhabitants of the great city of Delhi. Muhammad  determined to transfer his capital thence to Devagiri, whose name he  changed to Doulatabad. The two places are six hundred miles apart. The  king gave a general order to every inhabitant of Delhi to proceed  forthwith to Devagiri, and prior to the issue of this order he had  the entire road lined with full-grown trees, transplanted for the  purpose. The unfortunate people were compelled to obey, and thousands  -- including women, children, and aged persons -- died by the way. Ibn  Batuta, who was an eye-witness of the scenes of horror to which this  gave rise, has left us the following description: --    \"The Sultan ordered all the inhabitants to quit the place (Delhi),  and upon some delay being evinced he made a proclamation stating that  what person soever, being an inhabitant of that city, should be found  in any of its houses or streets should receive condign punishment. Upon  this they all went out; but his servants finding a blind man in one  of the houses and a bedridden one in the other, the Emperor commanded  the bedridden man to be projected from a balista, and the blind one to  be dragged by his feet to Daulatabad, which is at the distance of ten  days, and he was so dragged; but his limbs dropping off by the way,  only one of his legs was brought to the place intended, and was then  thrown into it; for the order had been that they should go to this  place. When I entered Delhi it was almost a desert.\"[20]    It is characteristic of Muhammad's whimsical despotism that shortly  afterwards he ordered the inhabitants of different districts to  go and repeople Delhi, which they attempted to do, but with little  success. Batuta relates that during the interval of desolation the  king mounted on the roof of his palace, and seeing the city empty  and without fire or smoke said, \"Now my heart is satisfied and my  feelings are appeased.\"    Ibn Batuta was a member of this king's court, and had every opportunity  of forming a just conclusion. He sums up his qualities thus: --    \"Muhammad more than all men loves to bestow gifts and to shed  blood. At his gate one sees always some fakir who has become rich, or  some living being who is put to death. His traits of generosity and  valour, and his examples of cruelty and violence towards criminals,  have obtained celebrity among the people. But apart from this he is  the most humble of men and the one who displays the most equity;  the ceremonies of religion are observed at his court; he is very  severe in all that concerns prayer and the punishment that follows  omission of it ... his dominating quality is generosity.... It rarely  happened that the corpse of some one who had been killed was not to  be seen at the gate of his palace. I have often seen men killed and  their bodies left there. One day I went to his palace and my horse  shied. I looked before me and I saw a white heap on the ground, and  when I asked what it was one of my companions said it was the trunk  of a man cut into three pieces.... Every day hundreds of individuals  were brought chained into his hall of audience, their hands tied  to their necks and their feet bound together. Some were killed,  and others were tortured or well beaten.\"[21]    A man of these seemingly opposite qualities, charity, generosity, and  religious fervour linked to unbridled lust for blood and an apparently  overmastering desire to take life, possesses a character so bizarre,  so totally opposed to Hindu ideals, that he would almost of necessity  be accounted as something superhuman, monstrous, a saint with the heart  of a devil, or a fiend with the soul of a saint. Hence Muhammad in the  course of years gathered round his memory, centuries after his death,  all the quaint tales and curious legends which an Oriental imagination  could devise; and whenever his name is mentioned by the old chroniclers  it is always with some extraordinary story attached to it.    Nuniz, therefore, though accurate in the main, was a century too  early in his opening sentence. His \"Togao Mamede\" can be none other  than Muhammad Taghlaq.    Henceforward this will be assumed.[22]        CHAPTER 2    Origin of the Empire (A.D. 1316)    Muhammad's capture of Kampli and Anegundi -- Death of his nephew  Baha-ud-din -- Malik Naib made governor of Anegundi -- Disturbances  -- Harihara Deva Raya raised to be king of Anegundi -- Madhavacharya  Vidyaranya -- The city of Vijayanagar founded -- Legends as to the  origin of the new kingdom.    The city of Vijayanagar is, as already stated, generally supposed to  have been founded in the year 1336, and that that date is not far from  the truth may be gathered from two facts. Firstly, there is extant  an inscription of the earliest real king, Harihara I. or Hariyappa,  the \"Haraib\" of Ibn Batuta,[23] dated in A.D. 1340. Secondly, the  account given by that writer of a raid southwards by Muhammad Taghlaq  tallies at almost all points with the story given at the beginning  of the Chronicle of Nuniz, and this raid took place in 1334.[24]    For if a comparison is made between the narrative of Batuta and the  traditional account given by Nuniz as to the events that preceded and  led to the foundation of Vijayanagar, little doubt will remain in the  mind that both relate to the same event. According to Ibn Batuta,[25]  Sultan Muhammad marched southwards against his rebel nephew,  Baha-ud-din Gushtasp, who had fled to the protection of the \"Rai of  Kambila,\" or \"Kampila\" as Firishtah calls the place, in his stronghold  amongst the mountains. The title \"Rai\" unmistakably points to the  Kanarese country, where the form \"Raya\" is used for \"Rajah;\" while in  \"Kambila\" or \"Kampila\" we recognise the old town of Kampli, a fortified  place about eight miles east of Anegundi, which was the citadel of the  predecessors of the kings of Vijayanagar. Though not itself actually  \"amongst the mountains,\" Kampli is backed by the mass of rocky hills  in the centre of which the great city was afterwards"]]]
