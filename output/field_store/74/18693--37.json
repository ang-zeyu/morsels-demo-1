The average ratio in samples from the  Pacific lowlands varies from 44.9 in Sinaloa and El Salvador to 47.8 in  Guerrero; on the Gulf lowlands of Mexico the average ratio varies from  45.6 in Veracruz to 47.6 on Isla del Carmen, Campeche. Specimens from  the Yucatan Peninsula and the Caribbean lowlands have relatively longer  legs; the variation in average ratios ranges from 49.1 in British  Honduras to 51.2 in Costa Rica and 51.5 in Honduras.    Specimens from southern Sinaloa are outstanding in the large size of  the tympanum; the tympanum/eye ratio varies from 84.2 to 94.4 (average  87.8). In most other samples the variation in average ratios ranges from  72.2 to 79.3, but specimens from Veracruz have an average ratio of 70.0;  Campeche, 65.7; Honduras, 67.0; and Limon, Costa Rica, 68.5.    No noticeable geographic trends in size and proportions are evident.  Specimens from southern Sinaloa are extreme in their large size,  relatively short tibia, and large tympani, but in size and relative  length of the tibia the Sinaloan frogs are approached by specimens from  such far-removed localities as San Salvador, El Salvador, and Chinaja,  Guatemala. Frogs from the Caribbean lowlands of Honduras and Costa Rica  are relatively large and have relatively long tibiae and small tympani.    The inner metatarsal tubercle is large and high and its shape varies.  The tubercle is most pronounced in specimens from northwestern Mexico,  Tamaulipas, and the Pacific lowlands of Central America. Possibly the  large tubercle is associated with drier habitats, where perhaps the  frogs use the tubercles for digging.    The ground color of _Smilisca baudini_ is pale green to brown dorsally  and white to creamy yellow ventrally. The dorsum is variously marked  with dark brown or dark olive-green spots or blotches (Pl. 6A). In most  specimens a dark interorbital bar extends across the head to the lateral  edges of the eyelid; usually this bar is connected medially to a large  dorsal blotch. There is no tendency for the markings on the dorsum to  form transverse bands or longitudinal bars. In specimens from the  southern part of the range the dorsal dark markings are often fragmented  into small spots, especially posteriorly. The limbs are marked by dark  transverse bands, usually three on the forearm, three on the thigh, and  three or four on the shank. Transverse bands also are present on the  tarsi and proximal segments of the fingers and toes. The webbing on the  hands and feet is pale grayish brown. The loreal region and upper lip  are pale green or tan; the lip usually is boldly marked with broad  vertical dark brown bars, especially evident is the bar beneath the eye.  A dark brown or black mark extends from the tympanum to a point above  the insertion of the forearm; in some specimens this black mark is  narrow or indistinct, but in most individuals it is quite evident. The  flanks are pale gray to creamy white with brown or black mottling, which  sometimes forms reticulations enclosing white spots. The anterior  surfaces of the thighs usually are creamy white with brown mottling,  whereas the posterior surfaces of the thighs usually are brown with  small cream-colored flecks. A distinct creamy white anal stripe usually  is present. Usually, there are no white stripes on the outer edges of  the tarsi and forearms. In breeding males the throat is gray.    Most variation in coloration does not seem to be correlated with  geography. The lips are strongly barred in specimens from throughout the  range of the species, except that in some specimens from southern  Nicaragua and Costa Rica the lips are pale and in some specimens the  vertical bars are indistinct. Six specimens from 7.3 kilometers  southwest of Matatan, Sinaloa, are distinctively marked. The dorsum is  uniformly grayish green with the only dorsal marks being on the tarsi;  canthal and post-tympanic dark marks absent. A broad white labial stripe  is present and interrupted by a single vertical dark mark below the eye.  A white stripe is present on the outer edge of the foot. The flanks and  posterior surfaces of the thighs are creamy white, boldly marked with  black. Two specimens from Alta Verapaz, Guatemala (CNHM 21006 from  Coban and UMMZ 90908 from Finca Canihor), are distinctive in having many  narrow transverse bands on the limbs and fine reticulations on the  flanks. Two specimens from Limon Province, Costa Rica (KU 34927 from  Batan and 36789 from Suretka), lack a dorsal pattern; instead these  specimens are nearly uniform brown above and have only a few small dark  brown spots on the back and lack transverse bands on the limbs. The  post-tympanic dark marks and dark mottling on the flanks are absent.  Specimens lacking the usual dorsal markings are known from scattered  localities on the Caribbean lowlands from Guatemala to Costa Rica.    The coloration in life is highly variable; much of the apparent  variation is due to metachrosis, for individuals of _Smilisca baudini_  are capable of undergoing drastic and rapid change in coloration. When  active at night the frogs usually are pale bright green with olive-green  markings, olive-green with brown markings, or pale brown with dark brown  markings. The dark markings on the back and dorsal surfaces of the limbs  are narrowly outlined by black. The pale area below the eye and just  posterior to the broad suborbital dark bar is creamy white, pale green,  or ashy gray in life. The presence of this mark is an excellent  character by which to identify juveniles of the species. The flanks are  creamy yellow, or yellow with brown or black mottling. In most  individuals the belly is white, but in specimens from southern El Peten  and northern Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, the belly is yellow, especially  posteriorly. The iris varies from golden bronze to dull bronze with  black reticulations, somewhat darker ventrally.    _Natural History._--Throughout most of its range _Smilisca baudini_  occurs in sub-humid habitats; consequently the activity is controlled by  the seasonal nature of the rainfall and usually extends from May or June  through September. Throughout Mexico and Central America the species is  known to call and breed in June, July, and August. Several records  indicate that the breeding season in Central America is more lengthy.  Gaige, Hartweg, and Stuart (1937:4) noted gravid females collected at El  Recreo, Nicaragua, in August and September. Schmidt (1941:486) reported  calling males in February in British Honduras. Stuart (1958:17) stated  that tadpoles were found in mid-February, juveniles in February and  March and half-grown individuals from mid-March to mid-May at Tikal, El  Peten, Guatemala. Stuart (1961:74) reported juveniles from Tikal in  July, and that individuals were active at night when there had been  light rain in the dry season in February and March in El Peten,  Guatemala. _Smilisca baudini_ seeks daytime retreats in bromeliads,  elephant-ear plants (_Xanthosoma_), and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37839"],[0,"My Experiences in Manipur and the Naga Hills (#4)"],[1,"two  bearers, Seewa and Keptie, wild Bhooyas from the Cuttack Tributary  Mehals, whom I had trained, and who had been with me for years in  all my wanderings, in that wild territory. Thanks to the kindness of  my friends the Bernards (now Sir C. and Lady Bernard), we spent only  a day at an hotel, and remained under their hospitable roof till we  left Calcutta.    My old appointment in Keonjhur had been abolished, and I had to wait  till another was open to me. I had several interviews on the subject  with the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, Sir G. Campbell. Finally it  was decided that I should go to Assam (then about to be made into a  Chief Commissionership) and act as Political Agent of the Naga Hills,  while the permanent official--Captain Butler--was away in the Interior,  and subsequently on leave. I knew a large part of the district well,  as one of the most malarious in India, and when asked if I would take  the appointment, said, \"Yes, I have no objection, but just hint to  the Lieutenant-Governor that unless he wants to kill me off, it may  be better policy to send me elsewhere, as the Medical Board in London  said, I must not go to a malarious district, after the experience  I have had of it in Keonjhur.\" The Secretary conveyed my hint, and  when I next saw him, said, \"The Lieutenant-Governor says, that is  all stuff and nonsense.\" Later on Sir G. Campbell asked if my wife  would go with me. I quietly replied that she would go anywhere with me.    Finally, on December 30th, we left Calcutta, and after a night in the  train, embarked in one of the I. G. S. N. Co.'s steamers at Goalundo,  for Nigriting on the Burrhampooter, where we had to land for the Naga  Hills. The steamers of those days, were not like the well-appointed  mail boats now in use. The voyage was long, the steamers uncomfortable,  and the company on board anything but desirable. All the same, the  days passed pleasantly, while we slowly wended our way up the mighty  river, amid lovely and interesting scenery all new to my wife, to  whom I pointed out the different historic spots as they came in view.    We halted at Gowhatty for the night, and early in the morning I swam  across the river for the second time in my life, a distance of about  three miles, as the current carried me in a slanting direction.    At last we reached Nigriting, and were landed on a dry sandbank five  or six miles from the celebrated tea gardens of that name, and the  nearest habitations. Fortunately, I had brought a tent and all things  needful for a march; and my servants, well accustomed to camp life,  soon pitched it and made us comfortable, and my wife was charmed with  her first experience. We had a message of welcome from Mr. Boyle,  of Nigriting Factory, and the next day went to his house in canoes,  whence we set out for Golaghat.    It was to Nigriting that I was carried for change of air nearly  twelve years before, when, in April, 1862, I was desperately wounded  in an encounter with a large panther near Golaghat, where I had been  stationed. I then lived for a week or so in a grass hut on a high  bank, and the fresh air made my obstinate wounds begin to heal. Thus it  happened that all the people knew me well, and I was long remembered by  the name of \"Baghe Khooah\" literally the \"tiger eaten,\" a name which I  found was still familiar to every one. Loading our things on elephants,  and having a pony for my wife, and a dandy (hill litter) in case she  grew tired, we set off for Golaghat, and had a picnic luncheon on the  way. How delightful are our first experiences of marching in India,  even when we have, as in this case, to put up with some discomfort;  the cool, crisp air in the morning; the good appetite that a ten-mile  walk or ride gives; the feeling that breakfast has been earned, and  finally breakfast itself; and such a good one. Where indeed but in  India could we have a first-rate meal of three or four courses, and  every dish hot, with no better appliances in the shape of a fireplace,  than two or three clods of earth? Often have I had a dinner fit for  a king, when heavy rain had been falling for hours, and there was no  shelter for my men, but a tree with a sheet thrown over a branch.    We breakfasted at a place called \"Char Allee\" and the march being  long (nearly twenty miles), the sun was low long before reaching  Golaghat. As we passed some road coolies, I began a conversation with  the old Tekla (overseer) in charge, and asked him if he could get me  a few oranges. He said, \"Oh no, they are all over.\" He then asked me  how I came to speak Assamese so well. I said, \"I have been in Assam  before.\" He said, \"Oh yes, there have been many sahibs in my time,\"  and he named several; \"and then long ago there was a 'Baghe Khooah'  sahib, I wonder where he is now?\" I looked at him and said, \"Ami Baghe  Khooah\" (I am the Baghe Khooah). The old man gazed equally hard at  me for a moment and then ran in front of me and made a most profound  obeisance. Having done this, he smilingly said, \"I think I can find  you some oranges after all,\" and at once ran off, and brought me some  for which he refused to take anything. The good old man walked about a  mile farther before he wished me good-bye; and my wife and I went on,  greatly pleased to find that I was so well remembered.    We did not get to Golaghat till long after dark, and pitched our tent  on the site of the lines of my old detachment, which I had commanded  twelve years before. What a change! Trees that I had remembered as  small, had grown large, and some that were planted since I left,  already a fair size.    In the morning we received a perfect ovation. People who had known me  before, crowded to see me and pay their respects, many of them bringing  their children born since I had left. All this was pleasant enough and  greatly delighted my wife, but we had to proceed on our way, and it  is always difficult to get one's followers to move from a civilised  place, where there is a bazaar, into the jungle, and henceforth our  road lay through jungle, the Nambor forest beginning about five miles  from Golaghat. At last coolies to carry my wife arrived, and I sent  her on in her \"dandy\" with her ayah, charging the bearers to wait  for me at a village I well knew, called \"Sipahee Hoikeeah.\" The men  replied, \"Hoi Deota\" (Yes, deity [4]) and started. The elephants  were a great difficulty, and it was some hours before I could get  off, and even then some had not arrived. However, off I started,  and hurried on to \"Sipahee Hoikeeah\" so as not to keep my wife  waiting, but when I reached the spot, I found to my amazement that  the village had ceased to exist, having, as I subsequently learned,  been abandoned for fear of the Nagas. I hurried on in much anxiety,  as my wife did not speak Hindoostani, and neither ayah nor bearers  spoke English. At last I caught them up at the Nambor hot springs,  called by natives the \"Noonpoong\" where we were to halt.        ------  FIGURE    Camping Out.    [Page 6.  ------        The Noonpoong is situated in a lovely spot amidst fine forest. The  hot water springs out of the ground, at a temperature of 112 degrees  and fills a small pool. It is similar in taste to the waters  of Aix-la-Chapelle, and is highly efficacious in skin diseases,  being resorted to even for the cure of severe leech bites, which  are easily obtained from the land leech infesting all the forests  of Assam. Fortunately some of our cooking things, with chairs and a  table arrived, also a mattress, but no bed and no tent. We waited  till 9 P.M., and finding that no more elephants came up, I made  up a bed for my wife on the ground under a table, to shelter her  from the dew, but while sitting by the camp fire for a last warm,  we heard the noise of an elephant, and saw one emerging from the  forest. Fortunately he carried the tent which was quickly pitched,  and we passed a comfortable night.    The hot springs are not the only attraction of the neighbourhood, as  about two miles off in the forest, there is a very pretty waterfall,  not high, but the volume of water is considerable, and it comes down  with a thundering sound heard for some distance. The natives call it  the \"phutta hil,\" literally \"rent rock.\" The Nambor forest is noted  for its Nahor or Nagessur trees (Mesua Ferma) a handsome tree, the  heart of which is a fine red wood, very hard and very heavy, and quite  impervious to the attacks of white ants. Europeans call it the iron  wood of Assam. It is very plentiful in parts of the forest between  the Noonpoong and Golaghat, and also grows in the lowlands of Manipur.    The next morning we set out for Borpathar, a village with a fine sheet  of cultivation on the banks of the Dunseree, and took up our quarters  in the old blockhouse, which had been converted into a comfortable rest  house. Here again we received a perfect ovation, the people, headed by  my old friend Hova Ram, now promoted to a Mouzadar, coming in a body,  with fruit and eggs, etc., to pay their respects. The population had  sadly diminished since my early days, the people having in many cases  fled the country for fear of Naga raids.    The march having been a short one, all our baggage had time to come  up. In the evening the girls of the village entertained us with one  of their national dances, a very pretty and interesting sight. After  a good night's rest we again started, our march lying through the  noble forest, where buttressed trees formed an arch over the road,  showing plainly that Gothic architecture was an adaptation from  nature. I had never marched along the road since it was cleared; but  I was there in 1862, in pursuit of some Naga raiders, when it would  have been impassable, but for elephant and rhinoceros tracks. Even  then I was struck by its great beauty, and now it was a fairly good  cold weather track.    We halted at Deo Panee, then at Hurreo Jan, and Nowkatta, and on"]]]
