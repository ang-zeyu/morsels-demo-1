Codfishing is to him a \"sport\"; \"and what  sport doth yeald a more pleasing content, and lesse hurt or charge then  angling with a hooke, and crossing the sweete ayre from Isle to Isle,  over the silent streams of a calme Sea?\" But the gallant Captain is also  capable of very plain speech, Cromwellian in its simplicity, as when he  writes back to the London stockholders of the Virginia Company: \"When  you send again, I entreat you rather send but thirty carpenters,  husbandmen, gardeners, fishermen, blacksmiths, masons, and diggers up of  trees' roots, well provided, than a thousand of such as we have.\"    America was but an episode in the wide wanderings of Captain Smith,  but he owes his place in human memory today to the physical and mental  energy with which he met the demands of a new situation, and to the  vividness with which he dashed down in words whatever his eyes had seen.  Whether, in that agreeable passage about Pocahontas, he was guilty of  romancing a little, no one really knows, but the Captain, as the first  teller of this peculiarly American type of story, will continue to have  an indulgent audience.    But other exiles in Virginia were skillful with the pen. William  Strachey's \"True Reportory of the Wrack of Sir Thomas Gates, Kt., vpon  and from the islands of the Bermudas\" may or may not have given a hint  to Shakespeare for the storm-scene in \"The Tempest.\" In either case it  is admirable writing, flexible, sensitive, shrewdly observant. Whitaker,  the apostle of Virginia, mingles, like many a missionary of the present  day, the style of an exhorter with a keen discernment of the traits of  the savage mind. George Percy, fresh from Northumberland, tells in a  language as simple as Defoe's the piteous tale of five months of illness  and starvation, watched by \"those wild and cruel Pagans.\" John Pory,  of \"the strong potations,\" who thinks that \"good company is the soul  of this life,\" nevertheless comforts himself in his solitude among the  \"crystal rivers and odoriferous woods\" by reflecting that he is escaping  envy and expense. George Sandys, scholar and poet, finds his solace  during a Virginia exile in continuing his translation of Ovid's  \"Metamorphoses.\" Colonel Norwood, an adventurer who belongs to a  somewhat later day, since he speaks of having \"read Mr. Smith's  travels,\" draws the long bow of narrative quite as powerfully as the  redoubtable Smith, and far more smoothly, as witness his accounts of  starvation on shipboard and cannibalism on shore. This Colonel is an  artist who would have delighted Stevenson.    All of these early tellers of Virginia tales were Englishmen, and most  of them returned to England, where their books were printed and their  remaining lives were passed. But far to the north east of Virginia  there were two colonies of men who earned the right to say, in William  Bradford's quiet words, \"It is not with us as with other men, whom small  things can discourage, or small discontentments cause to wish themselves  at home again.\" One was the colony of Pilgrims at Plymouth, headed by  Bradford himself. The other was the Puritan colony of Massachusetts Bay,  with John Winthrop as governor.    Bradford and Winthrop have left journals which are more than chronicles  of adventure. They record the growth and government of a commonwealth.  Both Bradford and Winthrop were natural leaders of men, grave,  dignified, solid, endowed with a spirit that bred confidence. Each was  learned. Winthrop, a lawyer and man of property, had a higher social  standing than Bradford, who was one of the Separatists of Robinson's  flock at Leyden. But the Pilgrim of the Mayflower and the well-to-do  Puritan of the Bay Colony both wrote their annals like gentlemen and  scholars. Bradford's \"History of Plymouth Plantation\" runs from 1620  to 1647. Winthrop's diary, now printed as the \"History of New England,\"  begins with his voyage in 1630 and closes in the year of his death,  1649. As records of an Anglo-Saxon experiment in self-government under  pioneer conditions these books are priceless; as human documents, they  illuminate the Puritan character; as for \"literary\" value in the narrow  sense of that word, neither Bradford nor Winthrop seems to have thought  of literary effect. Yet the leader of the Pilgrims has passages of grave  sweetness and charm, and his sketch of his associate, Elder Brewster,  will bear comparison with the best English biographical writing of that  century. Winthrop is perhaps more varied in tone, as he is in matter,  but he writes throughout as a ruler of men should write, with \"decent  plainness and manly freedom.\" His best known pages, justly praised  by Tyler and other historians of American thought, contain his speech  before the General Court in 1645 on the nature of true liberty. No  paragraphs written in America previous to the Revolution would have  given more pleasure to Abraham Lincoln, but it is to be feared that  Lincoln never saw Governor Winthrop's book, though his own ancestor,  Samuel Lincoln of Hingham, lived under Winthrop's jurisdiction.    The theory of government held by the dominant party of the first two  generations of New England pioneers has often been called a \"theocracy,\"  that is to say, a government according to the Word of God as expounded  and enforced by the clergy. The experiment was doomed to ultimate  failure, for it ran counter to some of the noblest instincts of human  nature. But its administration was in the hands of able men. The power  of the clergy was well-nigh absolute. The political organization of the  township depended upon the ecclesiastical organization as long as the  right to vote was confined to church members. How sacrosanct and awful  was the position of the clergyman may be perceived from Hawthorne's \"The  Minister's Black Veil\" and \"The Scarlet Letter.\"    Yet it must be said that men like Hooker and Cotton, Shepard and  Norton, had every instinct and capacity for leadership. With the notable  exception of Hooker, such men were aristocrats, holding John Winthrop's  opinion that \"Democracy is, among most civil nations, accounted the  meanest and worst form of government.\" They were fiercely intolerant.  The precise reason for the Hooker migration from Cambridge to Hartford  in 1636--the very year of the founding of Harvard--was prudently  withheld, but it is now thought to be the instinct of escape from the  clerical architects of the Cambridge Platform. Yet no one would today  call Thomas Hooker a liberal in religion, pioneer in political liberty  though he proved to be. His extant sermons have the steady stroke of a  great hammer; smiting at the mind and heart. \"Others because they have  felt the heavy hand of God... upon these grounds they build their hopes:  'I have had my hell in this life, and I hope to have heaven in the world  to come; I hope the worst is over.'\" Not so, thunders the preacher in  reply: \"Sodom and Gomorrah they burnt in brimstone and they shall burn  in hell.\" One of Hooker's successors has called him \"a son of thunder  and a son of consolation by turns.\" The same may be said of Thomas  Shepard, another graduate of Emmanuel College in the old Cambridge,  who became the \"soul-melting preacher\" of the newer Cambridge by  the Charles. Pure, ravishing notes of spiritual devotion still sing  themselves in his pages. He is wholly Calvinist. He thinks \"the truth  is a poor mean thing in itself\" and that the human reason cannot be \"the  last resolution of all doubts,\" which must be sought only in the written  Word of God. He holds it \"a tough work, a wonderful hard matter to be  saved.\" \"Jesus Christ is not got with a wet finger.\" Yet, like so many  mystics, he yearns to be \"covered with God, as with a cloud,\" to be  \"drowned, plunged, and swallowed up with God.\" One hundred years later  we shall find this same rhapsodic ecstasy in the meditations of Jonathan  Edwards.    John Cotton, the third of the mighty men in the early Colonial pulpit,  owes his fame more to his social and political influence than to his  literary power. Yet even that was thought commanding. Trained, like  Hooker and Shepard, at Emmanuel College, and fresh from the rectorship  of St. Botolph's in the Lincolnshire Boston, John Cotton dominated  that new Boston which was named in his honor. He became the Pope of  the theocracy; a clever Pope and not an unkindly one. He seems to have  shared some of the opinions of Anne Hutchinson, though he \"pronounced  the sentence of admonition\" against her, says Winthrop, with much zeal  and detestation of her errors. Hawthorne, in one of his ironic moods,  might have done justice to this scene. Cotton was at heart too liberal  for his role of Primate, and fate led him to persecute a man whose very  name has become a symbol of victorious tolerance, Roger Williams.    Williams, known today as a friend of Cromwell, Milton, and Sir Harry  Vane, had been exiled from Massachusetts for maintaining that the civil  power had no jurisdiction over conscience. This doctrine was fatal to  the existence of a theocratic state dominated by the church. John Cotton  was perfectly logical in \"enlarging\" Roger Williams into the wilderness,  but he showed less than his usual discretion in attacking the  quick-tempered Welshman in pamphlets. It was like asking Hotspur if  he would kindly consent to fight. Back and forth the books fly, for  Williams loves this game. His \"Bloody Tenet of Persecution for Cause of  Conscience\" calls forth Mr. Cotton's \"Bloody Tenet washed and made white  in the Blood of the Lamb;\" and this in turn provokes the torrential  flood of Williams's masterpiece, \"The Bloody Tenet yet more Bloody, by  Mr. Cotton's endeavor to wash it white in the Blood of the Lamb.\" There  is glorious writing here, and its effect cannot be suggested by quoting  sentences. But there is one sentence in a letter written by Williams in  his old age to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34101"],[0,"A Bilateral Division of the Parietal Bone in a Chimpanzee; with a Special (#4)"],[1," in growth of the two original, regular  segments of each of the bones.    The disproportion of growth of the two original segments of the  parietal bone will, I believe, be found more common as attention is  directed to this subject. It can be well explained, though there may  at times be other factors present, by a difference in the blood-supply  to the two centres. This of course may occur not only in different  skulls, but also on the two sides of the same cranium.
