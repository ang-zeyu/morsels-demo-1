If any city reader wishes an illustration of this fact, let  him observe how the iron verandah upon the Collamore House redeems the  otherwise bald, dead weight of that building. Then let him cast his eye  up Broadway to the long front of Niblo's Hotel--unrelieved and  blank--and consider the cheerful effect of a continuous gallery along  each story, or separate balconies at every window, as on the beautiful  _Chiaja_ at Naples. On the other hand let him ask his Metropolitan pride  how it would like a street of such edifices as the City Assembly Rooms  on the site of Tattersalls? So, also, in dwelling-houses, the balcony  which is now confined to the parlor floor might occasionally be carried  up through the other stories, and this, in narrow streets, with a  peculiarly happy effect, as is seen in such streets of foreign cities,  where the style, if elaborated in lattices and bay-windows, becomes  romantic and poetic.    \"Greater variety in the mouldings of doors and windows, and in the  designs of porticoes, might easily be obtained, with an infinite gain of  grace to the city. The Broadway Theatre illustrates this, for it is  certainly one of the most impressive buildings upon that street. The  question, it must be remembered, is not one of art, so much as of  picturesqueness and effect. The galleries and balconies, &c., are only a  subterfuge. If an edifice is intrinsically beautiful and  well-proportioned, it claims no such accessories, as Stewart's building,  which, although a simple square mass, yet from the admirable proportion,  rather than the material, is as stately and imposing as many a foreign  palace. But where there is no regard--as is the usual case--to the  dignity or propriety of form, there we must take advantage of an  alleviation, and obtain lightness, gayety, and variety as we best can.    \"There is, however, one point peculiar to American, or more properly to  New-York building, which calls for the determined and constant censure  of every man who values human life. We mean the flimsy style of building  arising from the frenzied haste with which we do every thing. This has  long been our reproach. Scarcely a year passes that we do not record  some disaster of this kind, often involving a melancholy waste of life.  '_Is it strong?_' is a question constantly asked of a new building, and  a question which, in any civilized community, it should be as  unnecessary to ask, as whether the public wells are poisoned.    \"We know many who will not pass under buildings now going up or recently  erected. A friend walked down Broadway one morning, while a building  was in course of erection on the site of the present Waverly House, and  returning in the afternoon found that it had all tumbled down. Our  readers have not forgotten the frightful fall of a block in Twenty-first  street last spring. One is curious to know if nothing is ever to be  done--if the city means to take no security for the lives of the  citizens in this matter. It would be very easy to prevent this flimsy  building, and even were it very difficult it should be effectually done.  This, too, is a matter in which every citizen is interested.    \"Stores and Warehouses have their own proprieties. Warehouses properly  avoid even the _appearance_ of lightness. They are devoted to heavy  storage. No life, save of bales and boxes,--and not of the contents of  bales and boxes--is associated with them. Security is the first and only  thing we demand of them, provided the structures are not painfully  disproportioned. So with Prisons. In fact, in architecture, the ornament  must depend upon the use, must be developed from the use. For the same  reason that balconies become a dwelling-house they disfigure a  warehouse. Stores again should partake, in their appearance, of the  intrinsic character and associations of shops. When shop-keeping becomes  royal, it should be royally housed, as in Stewart's building.    \"The theme unravels itself endlessly. It is one of those common  interests of constantly recurring importance which it is always worth  while to talk about. Because there is no American architecture, there is  no occasion for making our buildings mere piles of brick and mortar,  punctured here and there for light--and because we are a commonsense,  go-ahead people, there is no need that our houses should offend the eye;  but--for that reason--great need that they should please it.    \"Lorenzo of Florence was the magnificent, not because he was rich, but  because he knew the use of riches.\"    Despite all drawbacks, our city is growing wonderfully in splendor as  well as in size; and perhaps no previous season has promised so many  improvements in Broadway, uptown, or by the different parks, as the  present. Surpassing already any metropolis in the world in the number  and magnificence of our hotels, we are to have in occupancy within a few  weeks the splendid St. Nicholas and the gigantic Metropolitan, besides  half a dozen of inferior pretensions, which will yet surpass the best in  other cities; and new churches, and galleries, and public halls, are  talked of, in number and capacity, as in beauty, sufficient for all the  possible contingencies of a great capital, increasing in wealth, and  power, and beauty, with such unexampled rapidity. The power and  magnificence of New-York have been built up by her merchants, whose  private enterprise, public spirit, and intelligence and taste, are  especially conspicuous in the new edifices devoted to trade, of which we  have given descriptions.    [Illustration: INTERIOR OF BOWEN & M'cNAMEE'S SILK HOUSE.]          HERMAN HOOKER, D.D.    [Illustration]      Herman Hooker is one of the most able and peculiar writers in religion  and religious philosophy now living in America. Indeed, we are inclined  to doubt whether the Episcopal Church in the United States embraces  another author whose name will be as long or as respectfully remembered  in the Christian world. If he is not mentioned in \"every day's report,\"  it is because he adds to genius an unobtrusive modesty, as rare as are  the admirable qualities with which in his case it is associated.    Dr. Hooker is a native of Poultney, Rutland county, Vermont. He was  graduated at Middlebury College in 1825, and soon after entered upon the  study of divinity at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Princeton.  He subsequently took orders in the Episcopal Church, and acquired  considerable reputation as a preacher; but at the end of a few years ill  health compelled him to abandon the pulpit, and he has since resided in  Philadelphia. The distinction of Doctor in Divinity was conferred upon  him three or four years ago by Union College.    Dr. Hooker published in 1835 _The Portion of the Soul, or Thoughts on  its Attributes and Tendencies as Indications of its Destiny_; in the  same year _Popular Infidelity_, which in later editions is entitled,  _The Philosophy of Unbelief, in Morals and Religion, as discernible in  the Faith and Character of Men_; in 1846, _The Uses of Adversity and the  Provisions of Consolation_; in 1848, _The Christian Life a Fight of  Faith_; and soon after, _Thoughts and Maxims_, a book worthy of  Rochefoucauld for point, of Herbert for piety, and Bacon for wisdom.    Upon meeting with qualities like Dr. Hooker's in one not known among the  popular authors of the country, we are prompted to say with Wordsworth,  \"Strongest minds are often those of whom the world hears least,\" or in  the bolder words of Henry Taylor, \"The world knows nothing of its  greatest men.\" It is surprising that a voice like his should have  awakened no echoes. He deserves a place among the first religious  writers of the age: for he has been faithful to the great mission laid  upon the priesthood, which is, not to labor upon \"forms, modes, shows,\"  of devotion, nor to dispute of systems, schools, and theories of faith,  but to be witnesses of a law above the world, and prophets of a  consolation that is not of mortality. When we take up one of his books,  we could imagine that we had fallen upon one of those great masters in  divinity, who in the seventeenth century illustrated the field of moral  relations and affections with a power and splendor peculiar to that age.  These great writers possessed an apprehension of spiritual subjects,  sensitive, yet profoundly rational; a vision on which the rays of a  higher consciousness streamed in lustre so transcending that the light  of earth seemed like a shadow thrown across its course; which differed  from inspiration in degree rather than in kind. The resemblance of Dr.  Hooker to these great authors is obviously not an affectation. It is not  confined to style, but reaches to the constitution and tone of the mind.  His productions indicate the same temper of deep thoughtfulness upon  man's estate and destiny; the same union of a personal sympathy with a  judicial superiority, which suffers in all the human weaknesses which it  detects and condemns; the same earnest sense of their subjects as  realities, clear, present and palpable; the same quick feeling, toned  into dignity by pervading, essential wisdom; and that direct cognizance  of the substances of religion, which does not deduce its great moral  truths as consequences of an assumed theory, but seizes them as primary  elements that verify themselves and draw the theories after them by a  natural connection. Fretted and wearied with metaphysical theologies;  vexed by the self-illustration, the want of candor, the fierceness, the  ungenial and unsatisfying hollowness of popular religionism, we turn  with a grateful relief to this soothing and impressive system which  speculates not, wrangles not, reviles not, but, while it every where  testifies of the degradation we are under, touches our spirits to power  and purity by the constant exhortation of \"sursem corda!\"    The style of Dr. Hooker abounds in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3535"],[0,"A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany-Bay (#4)"],[1,": in consequence  of which, many privileges were extended to us, very unusual to be  granted to strangers. We were allowed the liberty of making short  excursions into the country, and on these occasions, as well as when  walking in the city, the mortifying custom of having an officer of the  garrison attending us was dispensed with on our leaving our names  and ranks, at the time of landing, with the adjutant of orders at the  palace. It happened, however, sometimes, that the presence of a  military man was necessary to prevent imposition in the shopkeepers, who  frequently made a practice of asking more for their goods than the worth  of them. In which case an officer, when applied to, always told us the  usual price of the commodity with the greatest readiness, and adjusted  the terms of the purchase.    On the morning of the fourth of September we left Rio de Janeiro,  amply furnished with the good things which its happy soil and clime so  abundantly produce. The future voyager may with security depend on  this place for laying in many parts of his stock. Among these may be  enumerated sugar, coffee, rum, port wine, rice, tapioca, and tobacco,  besides very beautiful wood for the purposes of household furniture.  Poultry is not remarkably cheap, but may be procured in any quantity;  as may hops at a low rate. The markets are well supplied with butcher's  meat, and vegetables of every sort are to be procured at a price next to  nothing; the yams are particularly excellent. Oranges abound so much,  as to be sold for sixpence a hundred; and limes are to be had on terms  equally moderate. Bananas, cocoa nuts, and guavas, are common; but the  few pineapples brought to market are not remarkable either for  flavour, or cheapness. Besides the inducements to lay out money already  mentioned, the naturalist may add to his collection by an almost endless  variety of beautiful birds and curious insects, which are to be bought  at a reasonable price, well preserved, and neatly assorted.    I shall close my account of this place by informing strangers, who may  come here, that the Portuguese reckon their money in rees, an imaginary  coin, twenty of which make a small copper piece called a 'vintin', and  sixteen of these last a 'petack'. Every piece is marked with the number  of rees it is worth, so that a mistake can hardly happen. English silver  coin has lost its reputation here, and dollars will be found preferable  to any other money.          CHAPTER VI.        The Passage from the Brazils to the Cape of Good Hope; with an Account  of the Transactions of the Fleet there.      Our passage from Rio de Janeiro to the Cape of Good Hope was equally  prosperous with that which had preceded it. We steered away to the  south-east, and lost sight of the American coast the day after our  departure. From this time until the 13th of October, when we made the  Cape, nothing remarkable occurred, except the loss of a convict in the  ship I was on board, who unfortunately fell into the sea, and perished  in spite of our efforts to save him, by cutting adrift a life buoy and  hoisting out a boat. During the passage, a slight dysentery prevailed  in some of the ships, but was in no instance mortal. We were at first  inclined to impute it to the water we took on board at the Brazils, but  as the effect was very partial, some other cause was more probably the  occasion of it.    At seven o'clock in the evening of the 13th of October, we cast anchor  in Table Bay, and found many ships of different nations in the harbour.    Little can be added to the many accounts already published of the Cape  of Good Hope, though, if an opinion on the subject might be risqued, the  descriptions they contain are too flattering. When contrasted with Rio  de Janeiro, it certainly suffers in the comparison. Indeed we arrived at  a time equally unfavourable for judging of the produce of the soil and  the temper of its cultivators, who had suffered considerably from a  dearth that had happened the preceding season, and created a general  scarcity. Nor was the chagrin of these deprivations lessened by the news  daily arriving of the convulsions that shook the republic, which could  not fail to make an impression even on Batavian phlegm.    As a considerable quantity of flour, and the principal part of the live  stock, which was to store our intended settlement, were meant to be  procured here, Governor Phillip lost no time in waiting on Mynheer Van  Graaffe, the Dutch Governor, to request permission (according to the  custom of the place) to purchase all that we stood in need of. How far  the demand extended, I know not, nor Mynheer Van Graaffe's reasons for  complying with it in part only. To this gentleman's political sentiments  I confess myself a stranger; though I should do his politeness and  liberality at his own table an injustice, were I not to take this public  opportunity of acknowledging them; nor can I resist the opportunity  which presents itself, to inform my readers, in honor of M. Van  Graaffe's humanity, that he has made repeated efforts to recover the  unfortunate remains of the crew of the Grosvenor Indiaman, which was  wrecked about five years ago on the coast of Caffraria. This information  was given me by Colonel Gordon, commandant of the Dutch troops at the  Cape, whose knowledge of the interior parts of this country surpasses  that of any other man. And I am sorry to say that the Colonel added,  these unhappy people were irrecoverably lost to the world and their  friends, by being detained among the Caffres, the most savage set of  brutes on earth.    His Excellency resides at the Government house, in the East India  Company's garden. This last is of considerable extent, and is planted  chiefly with vegetables for the Dutch Indiamen which may happen to touch  at the port. Some of the walks are extremely pleasant from the shade  they afford, and the whole garden is very neatly kept. The regular lines  intersecting each other at right angles, in which it is laid out, will,  nevertheless, afford but little gratification to an Englishman, who  has been used to contemplate the natural style which distinguishes the  pleasure grounds of his own country. At the head of the centre walks  stands a menagerie, on which, as well as the garden, many pompous  eulogiums have been passed, though in my own judgment, considering the  local advantages possessed by the Company, it is poorly furnished  both with animals and birds; a tyger, a zebra, some fine ostriches, a  cassowary, and the lovely crown-fowl, are among the most remarkable.    The table land, which stands at the back of the town, is a black dreary  looking mountain, apparently flat at top, and of more than eleven  hundred yards in height. The gusts of wind which blow from it are  violent to an excess, and have a very unpleasant effect, by raising  the dust in such clouds, as to render stirring out of doors next to  impossible. Nor can any precaution prevent the inhabitants from being  annoyed by it, as much within doors as without.    At length the wished-for day, on which the next effort for reaching the  place of our destination was to be made, appeared. The morning was calm,  but the land wind getting up about noon, on the 12th of November we  weighed anchor, and soon left far behind every scene of civilization and  humanized manners, to explore a remote and barbarous land; and plant in  it those happy arts, which alone constitute the pre-eminence and dignity  of other countries.    The live animals we took on board on the public account from the Cape,  for stocking our projected colony, were, two bulls, three cows, three  horses, forty-four sheep, and thirty-two hogs, besides goats, and a very  large quantity of poultry of every kind. A considerable addition to this  was made by the private stocks of the officers, who were, however, under  a necessity of circumscribing their original intentions on this head  very much, from the excessive dearness of many of the articles. It will  readily be believed, that few of the military found it convenient to  purchase sheep, when hay to feed them costs sixteen shillings a hundred  weight.    The boarding-houses on shore, to which strangers have recourse, are more  reasonable than might be expected. For a dollar and a half per day  we were well lodged, and partook of a table tolerably supplied in the  French style. Should a traveller's stock of tea run short, it is a  thousand chances to one that he will be able to replenish it here at a  cheaper rate than in England. He may procure plenty of arrack and white  wine; also raisins, and dried fruits of other sorts. If he dislikes to  live at a boarding-house, he will find the markets well stored, and the  price of butcher's meat and vegetables far from excessive.    Just before the signal for weighing was made, a ship, under American  colours, entered the road, bound from Boston, from whence she had sailed  one hundred and forty days, on a trading voyage to the East Indies. In  her route, she had been lucky enough to pick up several of the inferior  officers and crew of the Harcourt East-Indiaman, which ship had been  wrecked on one of the Cape de Verd Islands. The master, who appeared  to be a man of some information, on being told the destination of our  fleet, gave it as his opinion, that if a reception could be secured,  emigrations would take place to New South Wales, not only from the old  continent, but the new one, where the spirit of adventure and thirst for  novelty were excessive.          CHAPTER VII.        The Passage from the Cape of Good Hope to Botany Bay.      We had hardly cleared the land when a south-east wind set in, and,  except at short intervals, continued to blow until the 19th of the  month; when we were in the latitude of 37 deg 40 min south, and by the  time-keeper, in longitude 11 deg 30 min east, so that our distance from  Botany Bay had increased nearly an hundred"]]]
