Labrum (fig. 3) very broad  and extensive, flattened, pale in color, the anterior margin with about  two sense-organs. Mentum (fig. 4) deeply split behind but not  completely divided, the anterior margin with three primary teeth that  are subequal in size or the middle one a little smaller; a much reduced  lateral tooth on either side. Praementum smaller than the hypopharynx,  in outline roughly oval or semicircular with the two labial palpi  surrounded by hairs at the base. Hypopharynx (fig. 5) consisting of two  chitinized arms that are contiguous but not fused medially, the  concavity between them filled with a rounded cushion that is covered  with tubercles arranged in more or less distinct oblique parallel rows.  Antennae (fig. 6) two-segmented, the basal segment cylindrical with an  auditory plate on the face at beyond midlength; apical segment long and  slender, in length but slightly less than the basal segment, tapering  gradually to the bluntly rounded apex. Mandibles (fig. 7) simple with  the teeth blunt; apical point longer than the lateral teeth; dorsal  tooth single, broad, very flattened and obtusely pointed; ventral teeth  two, a little smaller than the dorsal tooth. Maxillae (fig. 2) of a  generalized structure, the cardines distinct and feebly chitinized;  distal lobes of the organ consisting of a subequal inner and outer  lobe; the outer lobe with an abundance of long, delicate hairs and  bearing a few sensory papillae including one larger palpiform organ.    _Pupa._--Length, 9.1-12.8 mm.  Width, d.-s., 1.6-1.8 mm.  Depth, d.-v., 1.6-1.9 mm.    Thoracic dorsum shiny light brown; in very old pupae the color is much  darker, but still retains a much brighter color than the leg and  wing-sheaths; abdomen pale becoming darker in age, especially on the  pleura.    Cephalic crest (fig. 13) low and depressed, inconspicuous, lying  between the antennal bases which extend beyond it; there are four small  setigerous lobes, the larger pair of which are posterior in position.  Front between the eyes broad, subparallel. Two blunt tubercles on  either side of the forehead. Eyes large, with coarse ommatidia. Labrum  semicircular in outline, tumid. Labial lobes large, oval, contiguous  with one another, at the tip of the labrum. Maxillary palpi moderately  long and slender, nearly straight, gradually narrowed to the tip which  ends opposite the knee-joint of the fore legs. Antennae with the basal  segments separated only by the cephalic crest, the sheaths ending about  opposite or a little before the lateral angle of the thorax.    Pronotal breathing-horns (fig. 14) very small, almost microscopic; when  viewed from the dorsal aspect appearing as tiny triangular tubercles.  Mesonotum moderately convex, unarmed, the V-shaped suture distinct; a  few setae on the mesonotum, including one near the end of each scutal  lobe. Wing-sheaths rather short, but narrow, ending about opposite  midlength of the third abdominal segment. Leg-sheaths ending opposite  the base of the fifth abdominal segment, the tips of the tarsi ending  about on a common level or those of the fore legs a trifle longer.    Abdominal segments (fig. 11) subdivided into four annuli that bear  transverse bands of microscopic setae; these bands increase in width  from the basal to the apical. Spiracles on the pleural region of  segments two to seven, lying opposite the third annulus and close to  the ventral margin of the pleura. No spiracles are discernible on the  dorsum of the eighth segment.

[Illustration]    [Illustration]          The Central Nervous System of Nucula and Malletia    WILLIAM A. HILTON      These bivalve forms are grouped among the simplest of the molloscs. It  is especially from the condition in _Nucula_ as described by Pelseneer  '91, that the conception of the most anterior ganglion being composed  of four ganglia, has its chief support. Drew '01, who has also studied  _Nucula_, believes that the lobes of the ganglion in _Nucula_ are  superficial and that the four connectives coming from the ganglion may  be interpreted in another way. That is, that one pair of nerves may  represent an otocystic branch partly fused with the connective. This  view seemed reasonable to him as Stempel '99 in _Solenyma_ found the  otocystic nerves arose directly from the cerebral ganglion.    The two species of this group used for study were collected at Laguna  Beach. _Nucula castrensis_ Hinds, occurs abundantly at low tide under  rocks. It is rather small for dissection, but very good complete series  were obtained and stained in hematoxylin. _Malletia faba_ Dall, was  much less abundant. Specimens were obtained from holdfasts or from  dredging. Although this was a larger species, gross dissection was not  very easily carried out on any of the specimens, but good series were  made.    The ganglia of _Nucula_ are easily studied in section. The cerebral  mass seems composed of one main mass, partly divided into four  subdivisions, the two central most completely fused, and the lateral  quite distinct in places. The central portion might represent the  cerebral ganglia and the lateral, the pleural if we take that  interpretation. The pedal ganglion is made of right and left parts  quite completely fused except at the margins. The pedal mass is the  smallest of the three chief ganglionic areas. The visceral ganglia are  quite widely separated and a little larger than the pedal mass.    The ganglia of _Malletia_ are in general plan similar to those of  _Nucula_, the greatest differences being in the cerebral mass. The  cerebro-pleural mass seems almost one. In most sections it is very  compact and a little more complicated in structure than the ganglion of  _Nucula_. However there are two small ventral ganglionic branches or  small ganglia attached to the ventral side of the cerebral mass. These  small ganglia may represent the visceral. Farther back in a cross  section series as the cerebral mass disappears two other small branches  take origin and run parallel to the nerves from the ganglionic cords.  These two branches on each side seem to run together before the pedal  ganglia are reached. Neither of these pairs of nerves seems connected  with an otocyst.    At the cephalic end of the cerebro-pleural ganglion the large  ganglionic cords are in evidence. A little distance from the cephalic  end on the dorsal side there are quite large groups of cells down from  the surface and surrounded by nerve fibers. The course of the fibers  here is quite complex. On the ventral lateral sides of the ganglia are  paired light areas of fibers which may be traced into the fibers of the  ganglionic cords.    The pedal ganglion is small and much as in _Nucula_. The visceral  ganglia are larger and widely separated.    In both _Nucula_ and _Malletia_ young specimens were used for study. In  _Nucula_ there was more the appearance of four ganglia in the  cerebro-pleural mass, and the ganglia seem less complex than in  _Malletia_. This last species has more separate pleural ganglia, if the  ganglionic cords can be so regarded.    In neither of the species studied were all parts of the connectives  easy to follow, so it was impossible to test the suggestions of Drew,  but in both species there is some indication of two lateral lobes of  the cerebral mass, and in _Nucula_ there is good evidence of two  central ganglia as well as the smaller lateral ones. The lateral  ganglia of the cerebral mass are most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37742"],[0,"Fishes of the Big Blue River Basin, Kansas (#4)"],[1,"12, T. 2S, R. 3E, June     19, 1958.     48-M: Washington Co., Mill Creek, Sec. 28, T. 2S, R. 2E, June 19, 1958.     49-M: Republic Co., Mill Creek, Sec. 8 and 17, T. 2S, R. 1W, July 23,     1958.     50-S: Washington Co., Little Blue River, Sec. 5, T. 1S, R. 4E, Aug. 9,     1958.     51-M: Republic Co., Rose Creek, Sec. 20, T. 1S, R. 2W, July 23, 1958.     52-S: Marshall Co., Big Blue River, Sec. 6, T. 4S, R. 7E, Aug. 6, 1958.     53-S: Marshall Co., Big Blue River, Sec. 18, T. 3S, R. 7E, July 29 and     30, 1957; May 28, and Aug. 6, 1958.     54-G: Marshall Co., Hop Creek, Sec. 13 and 18, T. 3S, R. 7E, May 28,     1958.     55-M: Marshall Co., Spring Creek, Sec. 29, T. 2S, R. 8E, July 9, 1958.     56-S: Marshall Co., Big Blue River at Marysville Dam, Sec. 20, T. 2S,     R. 7E, June 16, 1958.     57-M: Marshall Co., Horseshoe Creek, Sec. 6, T. 2S, R. 7E, July 1,     1958.     58-G: Marshall Co., unnamed creek, Sec. 2, T. 1S, R. 7E, July 1, 1958.     59-G: Marshall Co., Mission Creek, Sec. 3, T. 1S, R. 8E, Nov. 30, 1957.          ANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES      Forty-eight species were obtained in this survey and five others  have been recorded in literature or are deposited in museums: KSC =  Kansas State College Museum; and UMMZ = University of Michigan  Museum of Zoology. Specimens, unless designated otherwise, are in  the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History (KU).    In this list, the scientific name of each species is followed by the  common name, citations of previous records, and the stations where  the species was obtained. I follow Bailey (1956:328-329) in treating  _Lepisosteus osseus_ (Linnaeus), _Catostomus commersonnii_  (Lacepede), _Semotilus atromaculatus_ (Mitchill), _Notropis  lutrensis_ (Baird and Girard), _Pimephales promelas_ Rafinesque,  _Ictalurus melas_ (Rafinesque), _Ictalurus punctatus_ (Rafinesque),  and _Lepomis macrochirus_ Rafinesque, in binomial form only.    =Scaphirhynchus platorynchus= (Rafinesque), shovelnose sturgeon:  Jennings (1942:364) as _Scaphirhynchus platorhynchus_ (Rafinesque);  Bailey and Cross (1954:191). Stations 3-S and 4-S.    Shovelnose sturgeon were found only in the lower portion of the Big  Blue River. On April 20, 1957, many were seen in fishermen's creels  at Stations 3-S and 4-S. One male and two females that I examined on  that date were ripe or nearly so; eggs seemed well developed and  milt flowed freely from the male. After April, 1957, none was  collected or observed until April 26, 1958, when one specimen was  obtained while shocking. Forbes and Richardson (1920:27) reported  that shovelnose sturgeon spawn in Illinois between April and June,  and Eddy and Surber (1947:80) reported spawning in May and early  June in Wisconsin and Minnesota.    =Lepisosteus platostomus= Rafinesque, shortnose gar: Jennings  (1942:364). Stations 3-S and 4-S.    I saw shortnose gar at various times in 1956 and 1957 at Rocky Ford  Dam on the Big Blue River (Station 4-S). One was seen while shocking  at Station 3-S on December 26, 1957.    =Lepisosteus osseus= (Linnaeus), longnose gar: Jennings (1942:364)  as _Lepisosteus osseus oxyurus_ Rafinesque. Stations 1-S, 2-S, 3-S,  4-S, 6-S, 8-S, 9-G, 15-S, 18-G, 25-S, 41-S, 44-S, 52-S, and 53-S.    Longnose gar were abundant in the mainstream of the Big Blue River  but usually evaded capture. This species, and the shortnose gar,  resided in the larger rivers, with _L. osseus_ being taken in only  two creeks near their mouths. In periods of high water, gar moved  into the flooded creeks, but returned to the river as stream-levels  subsided.    Young-of-the-year _L. osseus_, averaging 21.5 mm. in total length  (range 13 to 30 mm.), were taken on June 14, 1957, and larger young  (estimated 60 to 70 mm. total length) were taken on June 27, 1958.    =Dorosoma cepedianum= (LeSueur), gizzard shad: Jennings (1942:364).  Stations 1-S, 3-S, 4-S, 6-S, 8-S, 44-S, 45-M, and 53-S.    Most gizzard shad were young-of-the-year, taken on July 16 and 17,  1957, at Stations 3-S and 4-S. Twenty specimens from Station 6-S  that were in their second summer of life were from 3.8 to 5.9 inches  total length at the last annulus (average 4.3). This species was  usually found in quiet water and was most abundant near the mouth of  the Big Blue River.    =Hiodon alosoides= (Rafinesque), goldeye. Stations 3-S, 4-S, and  53-S.    I caught five specimens of _H. alosoides_ from the Big Blue River,  and another specimen, obtained by Dr. R. B. Moorman in 1954, is at  Kansas State College (KSC 4984).    One goldeye that I caught on April 20, 1956, prior to the beginning  of my study, was a ripe female measuring 15.5 inches total  length. The fish was beginning its seventh summer of life.    =Cycleptus elongatus= LeSueur, blue sucker. The blue sucker is  included on the basis of a single specimen (KSC 2917) collected  by I. D. Graham and labeled \"Blue River.\" No other data are with  the specimen; however, most fishes deposited at Kansas State College  by Graham are dated \"1885\" or \"1886\" and were caught near  \"Manhattan\" (Riley County).    =Ictiobus cyprinella= (Valenciennes), bigmouth buffalo. Stations  3-S, 6-S, and 30-M.    Bigmouth buffalo were rare, and were taken only in quiet parts of  larger streams, and in the borrow-pit at Station 6-S.    =Ictiobus niger= (Rafinesque), black buffalo. Stations 3-S, 41-S,  and 53-S.    Only four individuals of _I. niger_ were taken. All were large  adults (more than 20 inches in total length), and all were shocked  in the deeper, swifter areas, where the channel narrowed.    =Ictiobus bubalus= (Rafinesque), smallmouth buffalo. Stations 1-S,  3-S, 6-S, 7-G, 18-G, 38-S, 41-S, 43-S, 46-M, and 53-S.    This species was found in relatively quiet waters in the main  channel, in cut-off areas, and in creek-mouths. The ages and total  lengths of 30 individuals obtained at Station 6-S were (average  followed by number of fish in parentheses): I, 2.4 (11); II, 4.4  (14); and III, 6.6 (5).    Canfield and Wiebe (1931:6-7, 10) recorded \"buffalo-fish\" and  \"buffalo\" from the Big Blue Basin in Nebraska; however, no specific  designation was given.    =Carpiodes forbesi= Hubbs, plains carpsucker. Station 3-S.    This represents the first record known to me of the plains  carpsucker from Kansas. The specimen (KU 4180), 430 mm. in standard  length, has the following characters: lower lip without a median,  nipple-like projection; dorsal fin-rays, 25; lateral-line scales,  38; diameter of orbit into distance from anterior nostril to tip of  snout, 1.1; body-depth into standard length, 3.3; and head-length  into standard length, 3.9. The specimen was taken while shocking a  wide, shallow channel, over sand bottom.    =Carpiodes carpio carpio= (Rafinesque), river carpsucker: Jennings  (1942:364). Stations 1-S, 2-S, 3-S, 4-S, 5-G, 6-S, 7-G, 8-S, 9-G,  11-G, 14-S, 15-S, 18-G, 19-G, 23-G, 25-S, 27-G, 28-G, 30-M, 38-S,  39-S, 41-S, 42-S, 43-S, 44-S, 45-M, 50-S, 52-S, and 53-S.    The river carpsucker occurred at most stations on the larger  streams, and in many of the smaller tributaries. In smaller streams  _C. c. carpio_ frequented the largest pools, in or near the  floodplains of larger streams. A marked preference for still water,  soft, silty bottoms, and areas with drift or other cover was  apparent; however, the species also occurred in open waters with  moderate to swift currents.    The sizes attained by the river carpsucker at different ages were  (averages followed by number of fish in parentheses): I, 1.9 (10);  II, 3.9 (5); III, 5.3 (8); IV, 7.7 (5); V, 11.9 (2); VI, 11.6 (7);  VII, 12.8 (6); VIII, 13.1 (1); IX, 14.9 (2); X, 15.8 (8); and XI,  17.6 (1). These averages are significantly less than those reported  by Buchholz (1957:594) for the river carpsucker in the Des Moines  River, Iowa.    Examination of the gonads of river carpsucker in summer, 1957,  indicated that spawning occurred in late July. Young-of-the-year,  averaging 21 mm. in total length, first appeared in my collections  on July 30, 1957.    =Carpiodes velifer= (Rafinesque), highfin carpsucker: Meek  (1895:135); Evermann and Cox (1896:389).    The highfin carpsucker was not taken in my survey. Meek (1895:135)  reported \"this small sucker [_C. velifer_] ... common in Blue River  at Crete,\" characterizing the specimens as having \"Dorsal rays, 24  to 30; scales in the lateral-line, 36 to 41; head 31/2 to 4; and  depth 21/2 to 3.\" The ranges in the number of dorsal rays and the  number of scales in the lateral-line are higher than usual in _C.  velifer_, or in _C. c. carpio_, which is now common in the Big Blue  River Basin. Both species normally have 33 to 37 lateral-line scales  and 27 or fewer dorsal rays (Bailey, 1956:352-353; Moore, 1957:79;  and Trautman, 1957:81-82). The other characters listed by Meek would  fit the young and some adults of either species, or possibly a  composite including _C. forbesi_.    Graham (1885:72) and Cragin (1885:107) reported _Ictiobus velifer_  (= _Carpiodes velifer_) from \"Eureka Lake,\" Riley County, Kansas.  This lake, which no longer exists, was in the Kansas River Valley,  about ten miles upstream from the mouth of the Big Blue River.  Other, more recent records from the Kansas River Basin, in the  vicinity of the Big Blue River, are: Maple Leaf Lake, Riley Co.,  Oct. 4, 1925; Deep Creek, Riley Co., no date; Wildcat Creek, Riley  Co., Sept. 7, 1923; and Wildcat Creek, Riley Co., Sept. 29, 1925  (UMMZ 122187-90). Most of the collections were made by Minna E.  Jewell (Nelson, personal communication).    =Moxostoma aureolum= (LeSueur), northern redhorse: Cragin (1885:108)  as _Moxostoma macrolepidotum_ LeSueur; Meek (1895:136) as _Moxostoma  macrolepidotum duquesnei_ (LeSueur); Evermann and Cox (1896:394-395);  and Jennings (1942:364) as _Moxostoma erythrurum_ (Rafinesque).  Stations 41-S, 43-S, 44-S, and 53-S.    I collected three northern redhorse from the Big Blue River Basin, and  another specimen was seined in the"]]]
