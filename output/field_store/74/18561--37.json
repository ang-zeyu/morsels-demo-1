It closed more firmly than ever the land-route to the  south, but the libraries of this great city, in which was preserved  nearly all that remained of ancient learning, were scattered by the  captors, and their contents carried far and wide. New Testament  manuscripts awakened fresh study in the western world, and led to a  cleansing and quickening of religion; narratives of old Greek explorers  made men impatient of the barrier which blocked them from the lands  which the ancients had known, and thus drove them to seek new routes by  sea.    Marvellous was the energy which now awoke. By 1492 Columbus had crossed  the Atlantic, and Vasco da Gama, having rounded the African continent,  had reached India by an ocean road which had nothing to fear from the  Mussulman power.    Two routes, in fact, had now been opened, for not only did the  Portuguese follow up da Gama's discoveries in the Indian Ocean, but the  Spaniards from the American side soon entered the Pacific. But neither  of these nations quite reached our distant islands. Their ships were  swept from the sea in the seventeenth century by the Dutch, whose  eastern capital was Batavia. From this port there started in 1642 a  small expedition of two ships under the command of Abel Tasman. Heading  his journal with the words, \"May the Almighty God give His blessing to  this voyage,\" the courageous Hollander went forth, and, sailing round  the Australian continent, struck boldly across the sea which now bears  his name. On December 16th the mountainous coast of our South Island  rose before him, and what we may now call New Zealand was seen by  European eyes. The ferocity of the inhabitants prevented the explorer  from landing on its shores, but his expedition spent some weeks along  the coast. His austere Calvinism prevented Tasman from observing in any  special manner the festival of Christmas, but as a Rhinelander he could  not forget the \"Three Kings of Cologne,\" whom legend had associated with  the Magi of the Gospels. On Twelfth Night his ships were abreast of the  small island which lies at the extreme north of the country, and \"this  island,\" wrote Tasman, \"we named Drie Koningen Eyland (i.e., Three Kings  Island), on account of this being the day of Epiphany.\"    Here then, at last, was a spot of New Zealand soil to which a name was  attached which told of something Christian. The name stood alone as yet,  but it contained a promise of the time when the Gentile tribes should  come to Christ's light, and their kings to the brightness of His rising.    For nearly a century and a half the startled Maoris treasured the memory  of the white-winged ships of the Hollander, before they saw any others  like them. At length, in 1769, there appeared the expedition of Captain  Cook. England had now wrested from the Dutch the sovereignty of the  seas, and Cook was looking for the \"New Zealand\" which appeared on the  Dutch maps, but which no living European had ever seen. More tactful and  more fortunate than his forerunner, Cook was able to open a  communication with the islanders and to conciliate their good-will.    Not yet, however, was England prepared to follow up the lead thus given.  Not until her defeat by the American colonists, which closed the \"New  World\" against her convicts, did Britain's statesmen bethink them of the  still newer world which had been made known by the explorer. In 1787 an  expedition went forth from England--not indeed to New Zealand, but--to  South-east Australia, where a penal colony was established at Port  Jackson. A strange and repulsive spectacle the enterprise presented, yet  these convict ships were the instruments for carrying on the message  which had been sent out from Jerusalem by apostolic bearers. \"Did God  send an army of pious Christians to prepare His way in the wilderness?\"  asked Samuel Marsden, the second chaplain of this colony. \"Did He  establish a colony in New South Wales for the advancement of His glory  and the salvation of the heathen nations in those distant parts of the  globe by men of character and principle? On the contrary, He takes men  from the dregs of society, the sweepings of gaols, hulks, and prisons.  Men who had forfeited their lives to the laws of their country, He gives  them their lives for a prey, and sends them forth to make a way for His  chosen, for them that should bring glad tidings of good things. How  unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!\"    Advance and retreat; check and recovery; failure of methods which seemed  direct and divine; compensating success through agencies that looked  hostile; the winds of the Spirit blowing where they list--none able to  tell beforehand whence they are coming or whither they will go: such are  the outstanding features of the long journey of the Christian faith  across the globe; such will be found to mark its history when  established in this land.          First Period.          CHAPTER I.    THE PREPARATION.    (1805-1813).      Every noble work is at first \"impossible.\" In very truth: for every    noble work the possibilities will lie diffused through immensity,    inarticulate, undiscoverable except to faith.      --_Carlyle._      For the seed-plot of Christianity and of civilisation in New Zealand we  must look away from the present centres of population to the beautiful  harbours which cluster round the extreme north of the country. Chief  among these stands the Bay of Islands. This noble sheet of water, with  its hundred islands, its far-reaching inlets, its wooded coves and  sheltered beaches, was for more than a quarter of a century the focus of  whatever intellectual or spiritual light New Zealand enjoyed. Here the  Gospel of Christ was first proclaimed, and the first Mission stations  were established. Here were founded the first schools, the first  printing press, the first theological college, the first library. Here  the first bishop fixed his headquarters, and here he convened the first  synod. Here was signed the Treaty of Waitangi, by which the islands  passed under British rule, and here was the temporary capital of the  first governor. Here, too, was the theatre of the first war between  Maoris and white men; here stood the flagstaff which Heke cut down; from  these hills on the west the missionaries beheld the burning of  Kororareka, whose smoke went up \"like the smoke of a furnace.\"    At the opening of the nineteenth century this important locality was  occupied by the warlike and enterprising tribe of the Ngapuhi. The soil  was generally infertile, but the waters teemed with fish, while the  high clay cliffs and the narrow promontories lent themselves readily to  the Maori system of fortification. The safe anchorage which the Bay  afforded early drew to it the whaling ships of Europe, especially as the  harbour was accessible from the ocean in all weathers. The Ngapuhi  eagerly welcomed these new comers, and prepared to take full advantage  of whatever benefits the outside world might offer.    Among the various _hapus_ of this tribe stands out pre-eminent that  which owed allegiance to the chief Te Pahi. This warrior had fortified  an island close to Te Puna on the north side of the bay. In readiness to  receive new ideas, and in the power to assimilate them, he and his  kinsmen, Ruatara and Hongi, were striking examples of the height to  which the Maori race could attain. Hardly had the century dawned which  was to bring New Zealand within the circle of the Christian world, when  word came to Te Pahi of the wonders to be seen at Norfolk Island, and of  the friendly nature of its governor, Captain King. To test for himself  the truth of these tidings, the chief, with his four sons, set forth  (about 1803) across the sea to the great convict station. The friendly  governor had left the island, but Te Pahi followed him on to New South  Wales, little thinking of the mighty consequences which would result  from his journey. Everyone at Port Jackson was struck with the handsome  presence and dignified manners of the New Zealander. He was received by  the governor into his house at Parramatta; he went regularly to church,  where he behaved \"with great decorum;\" and loved nothing so much as to  talk to the chaplain about the white man's God. His enquiries met with  ready sympathy, for the chaplain was no other than the Reverend Samuel  Marsden.    This remarkable man had hitherto found little to encourage him in his  labours, but his light shone all the more brightly from its contrast  with the surrounding darkness. Selected while still a student at  Cambridge, by no less a person than the philanthropist Wilberforce, for  this difficult position, Marsden had brought to his work a heart full of  evangelical fervour, a strong Yorkshire brain, and \"the clearest head in  Australia.\" During the eleven years which had passed since his arrival,  he had been fighting a courageous fight against vice in high places and  in low, but nothing had daunted his spirit nor soured his temper. His  large heart had a place for all classes and for all races. When he met  Te Pahi his sympathies were at once excited. Like Gregory in the  marketplace at Rome, he had found a people who must be brought into the  fold of Christ. Years were indeed to pass before active steps could be  taken, but the new-born project never died within him. Amidst all the  difficulties of his lot the thought of the New Zealanders was ever in  his mind, and their evangelisation the constant subject of his prayers.  Many years afterwards, on one of his journeys through their country,  Marsden remarked to those about him, \"Te Pahi just planted the acorn,  but died before the sturdy oak appeared above the surface of the  ground.\"    What this Maori pioneer had done may seem little enough, but that little  cost him his life. The presents which he carried home, and the house  built for him by Governor King"]]]
