On a clear January morning, when the air was keen, but no ice had yet  skinned over the surface of the water, a visit to some small ponds in an  open field not far from Kentish Town provided entertainment for several  days. The ponds were selected from their open airy situation, the  general clearness of their water, and the abundance of vegetation with  which they were adorned. Near the margin confervae abounded, their  tangled masses of hair-like filaments often matted together, almost with  the closeness of a felted texture. At intervals, minute bubbles of air,  with occasionally a few of greater size, indicated that the complex  processes of vegetable life were actively going on, that the tiny plants  were decomposing carbonic acid, dexterously combining the carbon--which  we are most familiar with in the black opaque form of charcoal--to form  the substance of their delicate translucent tissues, and sending forth  the oxygen as their contribution to the purification of the adjacent  water, and the renovation of our atmospheric air. This was a good sign,  for healthy vegetation is favorable to many of the most interesting  forms of infusorial life. Accordingly the end of a walking-stick was  inserted among the green threads, and a skein of them drawn up, dank,  dripping, and clinging together in a pasty-looking mass. To hold up a  morsel of this mass, and tell some one not in the secrets of pond-lore  that its dripping threads were objects of beauty, surpassing human  productions, in brilliant colour and elegant form, would provoke  laughter, and suggest the notion that you were poking fun at them, when  you poked out your stick with the slimy treasure at its end. But let us  put the green stuff into a bottle, with some water from its native  haunt, cork it up tight, and carry it away for quiet examination under  the microscope at home.    Here we are with the apparatus ready. We have transferred a few threads  of the conferva from the bottle to the _live box_, spreading out the  fine fibres with a needle, and adding a drop of water. The cover is then  gently pressed down, and the whole placed on the stage of the  microscope, to be examined with a power of about sixty. A light is  thrown somewhat obliquely by the mirror through the object, the focus  adjusted, and a beautiful sight rewards the pains. Our mass of conferva  turns out to contain one of the most elegant species. Fine hair-like  tubes of an organic material, as transparent as glass, are divided by  partitions of the same substance into cylindrical cells, through which a  slender ribbon of emerald green, spangled at intervals with small round  expansions, is spirally wound. We shall call it the Spiral Conferva, its  scientific name being _Spirogyra quinina_. Some other species, though  less elegantly adorned, make a pleasing variety in the microscopic  scene; and appended to some of the threads is a group of small crystal  bells, which jerk up and down upon spirally twisted stalks. These are  the \"Bell Flower Animalcules\" of old observers, the _Vorticellae_, or  Little Vortex-makers of the present day. Other small creatures flit  about with lively motions, and among them we observe a number of green  spindles that continually change their shape, while an odd-looking thing  crawls about, after the manner of certain caterpillars, by bringing his  head and tail together, shoving himself on a step, and then repeating  the process, and making another move. He has a kind of snout, behind  which are two little red eyes, and something like a pig-tail sticks out  behind. This is the Common Wheel-bearer, _Rotifer vulgaris_, a  favourite object with microscopists, old and young, and capable, as we  shall see, of doing something more interesting than taking the crawl we  have described.    A higher power, say one or two hundred, may be conveniently applied to  bring out the details of the inhabitants of our live box more  completely; but if the glasses are good, a linear magnification of sixty  will show a great deal, with the advantage of a large field, and less  trouble in following the moving objects of our search.    Having commenced our microscopic proceedings by obtaining some Euglenae,  Vorticellae, and a Rotifer, we are in a position to consider the chief  characteristics of three great divisions of infusoria, which will often  engage our attention.    It is well known that animalcules and other small forms of being may be  found in _infusions_ of hay or other vegetable matter, and hence all  such and similar objects were called _Infusoria_ by early observers.  Many groups have been separated from the general mass comprehended under  this term, and it is now used in various senses. The authors of the  'Micrographic Dictionary' employ it to designate \"a class of microscopic  _animals_ not furnished with either vessels or nerves, but exhibiting  internal spherical cavities, motion effected by means of cilia, or  variable processes formed of the substance of the body, true legs being  absent.\" The objection to this definition is, that it to some extent  represents theories which may not be true. That nerves are absent _all  through the class_ is an assumption founded merely upon the negative  evidence of their not having been discovered, and the complete absence  of \"vessels\" cannot be affirmed.    In the last edition of 'Pritchard's Infusoria,' to which some of our  ablest naturalists have contributed, after separating two groups, the  Desmids, and the Diatoms, as belonging to the vegetable world, the  remainder of the original family of infusoria are classified as  _Phytozoa_, _Protozoa_, _Rotifera_, and _Tardigrada_. We shall explain  these hard names immediately, first remarking that the Desmids and the  Diatoms, concerning whom we do not intend to speak in these pages, are  the names of two groups, one distinctly vegetable, while the other,  although now generally considered so, were formerly held by many  authorities to be in reality animal. The Desmids occur very commonly in  fresh water. We have some among our Confervae. They are most brilliant  green, and often take forms of a more angular and crystalline character  than are exhibited by higher plants. The Diatoms are still more common,  and we see before us in our water-drop some of their simplest  representatives in the form of minute boats made of silica (flint) and  moved by means still in dispute.    Leaving out the Desmids and Diatoms, we have said that in Pritchard's  arrangement the views of those writers are adopted who divide the rest  of the infusoria into four groups, distinguished with foreign  long-tailed names, which we will translate and expound. First come the  _Phytozoa_, under which we recognise our old acquaintance _zoophyte_  turned upside down. _Zoophytes_ mean animal-plants, _Phytozoa_ mean  plant-animals. We shall have by-and-bye to speak of some of the members  of this artificial and unsatisfactory group, and postpone to that time a  learned disquisition on the difference between animals and plants, a  difference observable enough if we compare a hippopotamus with a  cabbage, but which \"grows small by degrees, and beautifully less,\" as we  contemplate lower forms.    After the _Phytozoa_ come the _Protozoa_, or first forms in which  animality is distinctly recognised. Under this term are assembled  creatures of very various organization, from the extreme simplicity of  the _Proteus_ or _Amoeba_, a little lump of jelly, that moves by  thrusting out portions of its body, so as to make a sort of extempore  legs, and in which no organs can be discerned,[2] up to others that are  highly developed, like our _Vorticellae_. This group is evidently  provisional, and jumbles together objects that may be widely separated  when their true structure and real affinities are discerned.    [2] In some kinds and in some stages of growth this is not strictly  true.    Following the _Protozoa_, come the _Rotifera_, or Wheel-bearers, of  which we have obtained an example from our pond, and whose  characteristics we shall endeavour to delineate when our specimen is  under view; and last in the list we have the _Tardigrada_,  \"Slow-steppers,\" or Water Bears, queer little creatures, something like  new-born puppies, with a double allowance of imperfect feet. These,  though somewhat connected with the rotifers, are considered to belong to  a low division of the arachnida (spiders, &c.).    [Illustration: --_a_, motile; and _b_, resting condition of Euglenae.]    Feeling that we must be merciful with the long-tailed words and  explanations of classification, we reserve further matter of this kind  for the opportunities that must arise, and direct our attention to  living forms by watching the _Euglenae_ which our water-drop contains. We  have before us a number of elegant spindle-shaped bodies, somewhat  thicker in front than behind, and in what may be called the head there  glitters a brilliant red speck, commonly called an _eye-spot_, although,  like the eyes of potatoes, it cannot see. Round this eye-spot the  tissues are clear, like glass; but the body of the creature is of a rich  vegetable green, which shines and glistens as it catches the light. Some  swim rapidly with a rollicking motion, while others twist themselves  into all manner of shapes. Now the once delicate spindle is oddly  contorted, now it swells out in the middle, like a top, and now it rolls  itself into a ball. The drawings will afford some idea of these protean  changes, but they must be seen before their harlequin character can be  thoroughly appreciated. Some of the specimens exhibit delicate lines  running lengthwise, and taking a spiral twist as the creature moves  about; but in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36922"],[0,"Antarctic Penguins: A Study of Their Social Habits (#4)"],[1,"and on the  snow of the frozen lakes. There was no sign of love-making or any  activity whatever. All were in fine plumage and condition.    During the night of October 16 the number of penguins increased greatly,  and on the morning of the 17th there was a thin sprinkling scattered  over the rookery. (Fig. 11.) A few were in pairs or threes, but more in  groups of a dozen or more, and all the birds were very phlegmatic, many  of them lying on their breasts, with beaks outstretched, apparently  asleep, and nearly all, as yesterday, in the hollows, though there was  no wind, and away from the nesting sites. They were very quiet. Probably  they were fatigued after their journey; perhaps also they were waiting  the stimulation of a greater crowd before starting their breeding  operations. As the guano-covered ridges, on which the old nests are,  were fairly soft and the pebbles loose, they were not waiting for higher  temperatures in order to get to work.    During October 17 the arrivals became gradually more frequent. They were  dribbling up from the sea-ice at the north-end of the beach, and soon  made a well-worn track up the ice-foot, whilst a long line of birds  approaching in single file, with some gaps, extended to the horizon in a  northerly direction.    During the day I noticed some penguins taking possession of old nests on  the ridges. These mostly squatted in the nests without any attempt at  repairing them or rearrangement of any sort. Afterwards I found that  they were unmated hens waiting for mates to come to them, and that this  was a very common custom among them. (Fig. 10.) If two occupied nests  within reach of one another they would stretch out their necks and peck  at each other. Their endeavour seemed to be to peck each other's tongue,  and this they frequently did, but generally struck the soft parts round  the margin of the bills, which often became a good deal swollen in  consequence. Often also their beaks would become interlocked. They would  keep up this peck-pecking hour after hour in a most relentless fashion.  (Fig. 12.) On one occasion I saw a hen succeed in driving another off  one of the old nests which she occupied. The vanquished one squatted on  the ground a few yards away, with rumpled feathers and \"huffy\"  appearance, whilst the other walked on to the nest and assumed the  \"ecstatic\" attitude (page 46). Nothing but animosity could have induced  this act, as thousands of old unoccupied nests lay all around.    About 9 P.M. a light snowstorm came on, and those few birds who had  taken possession of nests, left them, and all now lay in the hollows,  nestling into the fine drift which soon covered the ground to the extent  of a few inches. A group of about a dozen penguins which arrived near  the ice-foot in the morning, halted on the sea-ice without ascending the  little slope leading to the rookery, and stayed there all day.    With the few exceptions I have noted above, all the birds that had  arrived so far either were much fatigued, or else they realized that  they had come a little too soon and were waiting for some psychological  moment to arrive, for they were all strangely quiet and inactive.      [Illustration: Fig. 10. IN THE FOREGROUND A MATED PAIR HAVE BEGUN TO    BUILD. BEHIND AND TO THE RIGHT TWO UNMATED HENS LIE IN THEIR SCOOPS    (Page 19)]    On October 18 the weather cleared and a fair number of penguins started  to build their nests. The great majority however, apparently resting,  still sat about. Those that built took their stones from old nests, as  at present so many of these lay unoccupied. They made quite large nests,  some inches high at the sides, with a comfortable hollow in the middle  to sit in. The stone carrying (Fig. 20) was done by the male birds, the  hens keeping continual guard over the nest, as otherwise the pair would  have been robbed of the fruits of their labours as fast as they were  acquired.    As I strolled through the rookery, most of the birds took little or no  notice of me. Some, however, swore at me very savagely, and one  infuriated penguin rushed at me from a distance of some ten yards,  seizing the leg of my wind-proof trousers. In the morning quite a large  number lay down on the sea-ice, a few yards short of the rookery,  content apparently to have got so far. They lay there all day,  motionless on their breasts, with their chins outstretched on the snow.    By the evening of October 18 most of the penguins had gathered in little  groups on the nest-covered eminences, but there was at that time ample  room for all, there being only about three or four thousand arrived.  Although there were several open water holes against bergs frozen into  the sea-ice some half mile or so away, not a single bird attempted to  get food.    At 6 P.M. the whole rookery appeared to sleep, and the ceaseless  chattering of the past hours gave place to a dead and impressive  silence, though here and there an industrious little bird might be seen  busily fetching stone after stone to his nest.    At that date it was deeply dusk at midnight, though the sun was very  quickly rising in altitude, and continuous daylight would soon overtake  us.      [Illustration: Fig. 11. THE ROOKERY BEGINNING TO FILL UP (Page 18)]    By the morning of October 19 there had been a good many more arrivals,  but the rookery was not yet more than one-twentieth part full. All the  birds were fasting absolutely. Nest building was now in full swing, and  the whole place waking up to activity. Most of the pebbles for the new  nests were being taken from old nests, but a great deal of robbery went  on nevertheless. Depredators when caught were driven furiously away, and  occasionally chased for some distance, and it was curious to see the  difference in the appearance between the fleeing thief and his pursuer.  As the former raced and ducked about among the nests, doubling on his  tracks, and trying by every means to get lost in the crowd and so rid  himself of his pursuer, his feathers lay close back on his skin, giving  him a sleek look which made him appear half the size of the irate  nest-holder who sought to catch him, with feathers ruffled in  indignation. This at first led me to think that the hens were larger  than the cocks, as it was generally the hen who was at home, and the  cock who was after the stones, but later I found that sex makes  absolutely no difference in the size of the birds, or indeed in their  appearance at all, as seen by the human eye. After mating, their  behaviour as well as various outward signs serve to distinguish male  from female. Besides this certain differences in their habits, which I  will describe in another place, are to be noted.    The consciousness of guilt, however, always makes a penguin smooth his  feathers and look small, whilst indignation has the opposite effect.  Often when observing a knoll crowded with nesting penguins, I have seen  an apparently under-sized individual slipping quietly along among the  nests, and always by his subsequent proceedings he has turned out to be  a robber on the hunt for his neighbours' stones. The others, too, seemed  to know it, and would have a peck at him as he passed them.    At last he would find a hen seated unwarily on her nest, slide up behind  her, deftly and silently grab a stone, and run off triumphantly with it  to his mate who was busily arranging her own home. Time after time he  would return to the same spot, the poor depredated nest-holder being  quite oblivious of the fact that the side of her nest which lay behind  her was slowly but surely vanishing stone by stone.    Here could be seen how much individual character makes for success or  failure in the efforts of the penguins to produce and rear their  offspring. There are vigilant birds, always alert, who seem never to get  robbed or molested in any way: these have big high nests, made with  piles of stones. Others are unwary and get huffed as a result. There are  a few even who, from weakness of character, actually allow stronger  natured and more aggressive neighbours to rob them under their very  eyes.      [Illustration: Fig. 12. \"The Hens would keep up this Peck-pecking hour    after Hour\"]      [Illustration: Fig. 13. An Affectionate Couple (Page 26)]    In speaking of the robbery which is such a feature of the rookery during  nest building, special note must be made of the fact that violence is  never under any circumstances resorted to by the thieves. When detected,  these invariably beat a retreat, and offer not the least resistance to  the drastic punishment they receive if they are caught by their  indignant pursuers. The only disputes that ever take place over the  question of property are on the rare occasions when a _bona-fide_  misunderstanding arises over the possession of a nest. These must be  very rare indeed, as only on one occasion have I seen such a quarrel  take place. The original nesting sites being, as I will show, chosen by  the hens, it is the lady, in every case, who is the cause of the battle,  and when she is won her scoop goes with her to the victor.    As I grew to know these birds from continued observation, it was  surprising and interesting to note how much they differed in character,  though the weaker-minded who would actually allow themselves to be  robbed, were few and far between, as might be expected. Few, if any, of  these ever could succeed in hatching their young and winning them  through to the feathered stage.    When starting to make her nest, the usual procedure is for the hen to  squat on the ground for some time, probably to thaw it, then working  with her claws to scratch away at the material beneath her, shooting out  the rubble behind her. As she does this she shifts her position in a  circular direction until she has scraped out a round hollow. Then the  cock brings stones, performing journey after journey, returning each  time with one pebble in his beak"]]]
