D.           *       *       *       *       *    The present insect is selected to illustrate a very elegant family of  Butterflies, whose predominant tints are composed of orange, yellow, and  white, variously blended and disposed in a greater or less degree  throughout all the species. The generic characters above given will  distinguish them as peculiar to the tropics, and principally those of South  America; one or two species only being found in Africa, and five or six  inhabiting India.    I have no doubt this is the _Pap. Statira_ of Cramer; it is found only in  Brazil, and has been erroneously considered by Godart and Latreille as a  variety of _C. Jugurthina_, an Indian insect, and which in fact is not in  itself a species, being no other than the female of _C. Alcmeone_, as an  attentive examination of a vast number of both, collected in Java by Dr.  Horsfield, enabled me to ascertain.    The extraordinary prolongation of the last joint of the palpi, and the  white borderless spots beneath, which are never silvered, will distinguish  this species through all the variations; in the ground colour of its wings,  which in no two specimens are exactly alike, and one before me is nearly  white; the lesser snowy dot is sometimes very obscure, and often wanting;  but the prolongation of the palpi is even expressed in Cramer's figure  above quoted.    I have examined about a dozen specimens, mostly captured by myself, and all  have been females; and I strongly suspect future and more decided  observations will prove _C. Evadne_ to be the other sex: it has the palpi  lengthened, though in a less degree; and the articulations of the antennae  in both insects will be found somewhat thickened at their termination when  viewed under a magnifier, a peculiarity I have seen in no other species;  and although I have examined near thirty specimens of _C. Evadne_, they  have invariably proved to be males.    The palpi in this insect will be found at variance with the generic  character now given; a striking proof that in a natural system no single  part can be taken as an unerring criterion for generic distinction, without  making it eventually an artificial one. The _Colias Drya_ of Fabricius has  the same formation of palpi, but is a totally different insect.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 6    [Illustration]    COLIAS Leachiana.    _Leachian Colias._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 5.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _C. alis subrotundatis, integris, virescenti-albidis, anticis supra      fulvis, margine punctoque medio nigris, singulis subtus macula centrali      ferruginea._ Encycl.

Method._ vol. ix. p. 91.           *       *       *       *       *    In size this insect is the largest of the genus yet discovered; it was  first noticed by Godart, who has given it the name of my learned and valued  friend, Dr. W. E. Leach, of the British Museum, whose talents are too well  known to need any eulogium in this place.    It appears to inhabit both the northern and southern extremities of Brazil;  for I have seen it in a box sent from Para, and my specimens were captured  in Minas Geraes by my friend Dr. Langsdorff. It is, however, a rare  species; for I have only seen seven or eight specimens, and they were all  males: the female, when found, will probably differ as remarkably as in  most of this genus.    The opaque spot on the inferior wings above is very large; but the tuft of  hair corresponding beneath the superior wings, is entirely wanting. It  should be likewise observed, that although this insect in every outward  respect resembles a genuine _Colias_ (the type of which may be _C. Ebule_),  it differs very materially in the terminal appendages of the abdomen; the  last joint being the shortest, and scarcely pointed; and the hook, instead  of being concealed beneath this segment, is exserted beyond it, and met by  two others, one at the base of each lateral valve: these valves are also  much shorter, ovate, and not attenuated, although ending in an incurved  hook. In the present ignorance in which a true knowledge of the Lepidoptera  is involved, it is impossible to say how far these dissimilarities may  point out natural groups; it is therefore of the highest importance to the  science such facts should be noticed.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 7    [Illustration]    CARDUELIS cucullata.    _Hooded Seed-eater._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum breve, validum, conicum, rectissimum; mandibulis      subaequalibus; apice immarginato, recto, acuto; mandibula superiore      culmine convexa; inferiore basi marginis angulata, utrinque subtusque      convexa._    Typus Genericus _Fringilla Canaria_.

The only one I have yet seen is in the  possession of E. Falkner, Esq. of Fairfield near Liverpool, who received it  with a few other rare birds from the Spanish Main.    Total length four inches. Bill blackish and very sharp. The whole head and  forepart of the neck is black. The plumage of the body is a fine  reddish-orange, duller on the back and brightest beneath: wing-covers the  same; the greater ones at their base black, which forms a bar: the quills  are also black, the greater ones having at their base an oblique bar of  orange, and some of the lesser ones slightly margined externally with  white. Tail divaricated and black; some of the lateral feathers faintly  margined with orange. Spurious wings black. Legs and claws brown.    The _Bouvreuil de Bourbon_, and the _B. du Cap de Bonne Esperance_ of  Buffon (_Pl. Enl. pl._ 204. _fig._ 1, 2.) appear to have been described as  the different sexes of one bird (the Orange Grossbeak of Latham) on mere  conjecture. I think them quite distinct, inhabiting different countries,  and having all the appearance (in the figures) of being two male birds; for  the females in this family seldom possess the rich colours of the male; and  the figure of the last of these birds, has not the slightest habit of a  female.    The present genus was formed by Cuvier, (though but very slightly defined,)  and includes the common Goldfinch and Canary-bird.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 8    [Illustration]    MEROPS urica.    _Javanese Bee-eater._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum productum, laeve, subcurvatum, compressum; apice acuto, basi      trigono; culmine carinato.

They are found in both  temperate and tropical seas; but the definitions hitherto given by  conchologists are so imperfect, that they have left our knowledge of these  shells nearly the same now, as in the time of Linnaeus. Seventeen species  only are enumerated in Mr. Dillwyn's work; although thirty-four have fallen  within my own observation the last few months.    The difference between this and the common black Californian Ear, consists  in its being a much deeper and smoother shell, always narrowest at the  base, the outer lip not having (as in that) a prominent curve or gibbosity  where it joins the spire; but principally in the perforations, which in  this are always half as large, and doubly numerous; it is also generally a  much smaller, and less common species: the spire is always deeply tinged  with pink. The genus _Padollus_, of Montford, resting entirely in the  unevenness of the outer lip, without any knowledge of the animal, appears  to me an unnecessary distinction, for such is the character of all young  shells, and also of mature ones, whose outer surface is rugged or uneven.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 81    [Illustration]    SPHINX Ello.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Antennae prismaticae, in utroque sexu ad medium leviter crassescentes,      externe breviter piloso baciliatae, mucrone arcuato, producto, sensim      terminantes.

The two insects figured were received from Jamaica by my friend Dr. Leach,  and there can be no doubt they are the sexes of one species. The upper is a  male, and agrees with Drury's figure and description; the lower insect is a  female, of which no representation has been published: as for Cramer's  figure, if intended for the former, it is really so bad that it can hardly  be quoted as an authority, and it appears to have misled Fabricius, in  thinking that the female insect had a brown stripe on the anterior wings,  whereas that character is more applicable to the male.    The insects I propose retaining under this genus are such as have the body  lengthened, pointed, and not bearded at the tip; the antennae but slightly  thickened in the middle, and the terminating hook gradual, arched, and not  very acute: these comprehend the first section of Latreille's genus,  _Sphinx_, and are by him again divided into two groups, the one having the  wings entire, the other angulated.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 82    [Illustration]    TROCHILUS niger,    _Black Humming Bird._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum elongatum, rectum vel arcuatum, flexile, gracillimum, ad basin      depressum, mandibula superiore inferiorem amplectente et tantum non      obtegente.
