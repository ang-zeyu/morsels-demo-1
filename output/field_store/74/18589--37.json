And see that  he does not die.\"    He strode away, and Otar began to laugh.    From a vast distance, Stark heard that shrill, wild laughter. His mouth  was full of blood, and he was mad with a cold fury.    A cunning that was purely animal guided his movements then. His head  fell forward, and his body hung inert against the thongs. He might  almost have been dead.    A knot of men came toward him. He listened to them. They were hesitant  and afraid. Then, as he did not move, they plucked up courage and came  closer, and one prodded him gently with the point of his spear.    \"Prick him well,\" said another. \"Let us be sure!\"    The sharp point bit a little deeper. A few drops of blood welled out and  joined the small red streams that ran from the weals of the lash. Stark  did not stir.    The spearman grunted. \"He is safe enough now.\"    Stark felt the knife blades working at the thongs. He waited. The  rawhide snapped, and he was free.    He did not fall. He would not have fallen then if he had taken a death  wound. He gathered his legs under him and sprang.    He picked up the spearman in that first rush and flung him into the  fire. Then he began to run toward the place where the scaly mounts were  herded, leaving a trail of blood behind him on the snow.    A man loomed up in front of him. He saw the shadow of a spear and  swerved, and caught the haft in his two hands. He wrenched it free and  struck down with the butt of it, and went on. Behind him he heard voices  shouting and the beginning of turmoil.    The Lord Ciaran turned and came back, striding fast.    There were men before Stark now, many men, the circle of watchers  breaking up because there had been nothing more to watch. He gripped the  long spear. It was a good weapon, better than the flint-tipped stick  with which the boy N'Chaka had hunted the giant lizard of the rocks.    His body curved into a half crouch. He voiced one cry, the challenging  scream of a predatory killer, and went in among the men.    He did slaughter with that spear. They were not expecting attack. They  were not expecting anything. Stark had sprung to life too quickly. And  they were afraid of him. He could smell the fear on them. Fear not of a  man like themselves, but of a creature less and more than man.    He killed, and was happy.    They fell away from him, the wild riders of Mekh. They were sure now  that he was a demon. He raged among them with the bright spear, and they  heard again that sound that should not have come from a human throat,  and their superstitious terror rose and sent them scrambling out of his  path, trampling on each other in childish panic.    He broke through, and now there was nothing between him and escape but  two mounted men who guarded the herd.    Being mounted, they had more courage. They felt that even a warlock  could not stand against their charge. They came at him as he ran, the  padded feet of their beasts making a muffled drumming in the snow.    Without breaking stride, Stark hurled his spear.           *       *       *       *       *    It drove through one man's body and tumbled him off, so that he fell  under his comrade's mount and fouled its legs. It staggered and reared  up, hissing, and Stark fled on.    Once he glanced over his shoulder. Through the milling, shouting crowd  of men he glimpsed a dark, mailed figure with a winged mask, going  through the ruck with a loping stride and bearing a sable axe raised  high for the throwing.    Stark was close to the herd now. And they caught his scent.    The Norland brutes had never liked the smell of him, and now the reek of  blood upon him was enough in itself to set them wild. They began to hiss  and snarl uneasily, rubbing their reptilian flanks together as they  wheeled around, staring at him with lambent eyes.    He rushed them, before they should quite decide to break. He was quick  enough to catch one by the fleshy comb that served it for a forelock,  held it with savage indifference to its squealing, and leaped to its  back. Then he let it bolt, and as he rode it he yelled, a shrill brute  cry that urged the creatures on to panic.    The herd broke, stampeding outward from its center like a bursting  shell.    Stark was in the forefront. Clinging low to the scaly neck, he saw the  men of Mekh scattered and churned and tramped into the snow by the  flying pads. In and out of the shelters, kicking the brush walls down,  lifting up their harsh reptilian voices, they went racketing through the  camp, leaving behind them wreckage as of a storm. And Stark went with  them.    He snatched a cloak from off the shoulders of some petty chieftain as he  went by, and then, twisting cruelly on the fleshy comb, beating with his  fist at the creature's head, he got his mount turned in the way he  wanted it to go, down the valley.    He caught one last glimpse of the Lord Ciaran, fighting to hold one of  the creatures long enough to mount, and then a dozen striving bodies  surged around him, and Stark was gone.    The beast did not slacken pace. It was as though it thought it could  outrun the alien, bloody thing that clung to its back. The last fringes  of the camp shot by and vanished in the gloom, and the clean snow of the  lower valley lay open before it. The creature laid its belly to the  ground and went, the white spray spurting from its heels.    Stark hung on. His strength was gone now, run out suddenly with the  battle-madness. He became conscious now that he was sick and bleeding,  that his body was one cruel pain. In that moment, more than in the hours  that had gone before, he hated the black leader of the clans of Mekh.    That flight down the valley became a sort of ugly dream. Stark was aware  of rock walls reeling past, and then they seemed to widen away and the  wind came out of nowhere like the stroke of a great hammer, and he was  on the open moors again.    The beast began to falter and slow down. Presently it stopped.    Stark scooped up snow to rub on his wounds. He came near to fainting,  but the bleeding stopped and after that the pain was numbed to a dull  ache. He wrapped the cloak around him and urged the beast to go on,  gently this time, patiently, and after it had breathed it obeyed him,  settling into the shuffling pace it could keep up for hours.    He was three days on the moors. Part of the time he rode in a sort of  stupor, and part of the time he was feverishly alert, watching the  skyline. Frequently he took the shapes of thrusting rocks for riders,  and found what cover he could until he was sure they did not move. He  was afraid to dismount, for the beast had no bridle. When it halted to  rest he remained upon its back, shaking, his brow beaded with sweat.    The wind scoured his tracks clean as soon as he made them. Twice, in the  distance, he did see riders, and one of those times he burrowed into a  tall drift and stayed there for several hours.    The ruined towers marched with him across the bitter land, lonely giants  fifty miles apart. He did not go near them.    He knew that he wandered a good bit, but he could not help it, and it  was probably his salvation. In those tortured badlands, riven by ages of  frost and flood, one might follow a man on a straight track between two  points. But to find a single rider lost in that wilderness was a matter  of sheer luck, and the odds were with Stark.    One evening at sunset he came out upon a plain that sloped upward to a  black and towering scarp, notched with a single pass.    The light was level and blood-red, glittering on the frosty rock so that  it seemed the throat of the pass was aflame with evil fires. To Stark's  mind, essentially primitive and stripped now of all its acquired reason,  that narrow cleft appeared as the doorway to the dwelling place of  demons as horrible as the fabled creatures that roam the Darkside of his  native world.    He looked long at the Gates of Death, and a dark memory crept into his  brain. Memory of that nightmare experience when the talisman had made  him seem to walk into that frightful pass, not as Stark, but as Ban  Cruach.    He remembered Otar's words--_I have seen Ban Cruach the mighty_. Was he  still there beyond those darkling gates, fighting his unimagined war,  alone?    Again, in memory, Stark heard the evil piping of the wind. Again, the  shadow of a dim and terrible shape loomed up before him....    He forced remembrance of that vision from his mind, by a great effort.  He could not turn back now. There was no place to go.    His weary beast plodded on, and now Stark saw as in a dream that a great  walled city stood guard before that awful Gate. He watched the city  glide toward him through a crimson haze, and fancied he could see the  ages clustered like birds around the towers.    He had reached Kushat, with the talisman of Ban Cruach still strapped in  the blood-stained belt around his waist.          IV      He stood in a large square, lined about with huckster's stalls and the  booths of wine-sellers. Beyond were buildings, streets, a city. Stark  got a blurred impression of a grand and brooding darkness, bulking huge  against the mountains, as bleak and proud as they, and quite as ancient,  with many ruins and deserted quarters.    He was not sure how he had come there, but he was standing on his own  feet, and someone was pouring sour wine into his mouth. He drank it  greedily. There were people around him, jostling, chattering, demanding  answers to their questions. A girl's voice said sharply, \"Let him be!  Can't you see he's hurt?\"    Stark looked down. She was slim and ragged, with black hair and large  eyes yellow as a cat's. She held a leather bottle in her hands. She  smiled at him and said, \"I'm Thanis. Will you drink more wine?\"    \"I will,\" said Stark, and did, and then said, \"Thank you, Thanis.\" He  put his hand on her shoulder, to steady himself. It was a supple  shoulder,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32677"],[0,"The Invention of the Sewing Machine (#4)"],[1,". The Honorable Charles  Mason, Patent Commissioner, reported:         When the first inventor allows his discovery to slumber for       eighteen years, with no probability of its ever being brought into       useful activity, and when it is only resurrected to supplant and       strangle an invention which has been given to the public, and which       has been made practically useful, all reasonable presumption should       be in favor of the inventor who has been the means of conferring       the real benefit upon the world.[26]    Hunt's machine was an invention of the 1830s, but only because of the  patent litigation was it ever heard of again.    During the time that a potentially successful sewing machine was being  invented and forgotten in America, Josef Madersperger of Austria made a  second attempt to solve the mechanical stitching problem. In 1839 he  received a second patent on a machine entirely different from his 1814  effort. It was similar to Hunt's in that it used an eye-pointed needle  and passed a thread through the loop of the needle-thread--the thread  carried by the needle--to lock the stitch. Madersperger's machine was a  multiple-needle quilting machine. The threaded needles penetrated the  fabric from below and were retracted, leaving the loops on the surface.  A thread was drawn through the loops to produce what the inventor termed  a chain. The first two stitches were twisted before insertion into the  next two, producing a type of twisted lockstitch. The mechanism for  feeding the cloth was faulty, however, and the inventor himself stated  in the specifications that much remained to perfect and simplify it  before its general application. (This machine was illustrated [fig. 10]  in the _Sewing Machine Times_, October 25, 1907, and mistakenly referred  to as the 1814 model.) Madersperger realized no financial gain from  either venture and died in a poorhouse in 1850.    The first efforts of the 1840s reflected the work of the earlier years.  In England, Edward Newton and Thomas Archbold invented and patented a  machine on May 4, 1841, for tambouring or ornamenting the backs of  gloves. Their machine used a hook on the upper surface to catch the loop  of thread, but an eye-pointed needle from underneath was used to carry  the thread up through the fabric. The machine was designed to use three  needles for three rows of chainstitching, if required. Although the  machine was capable of stitching two fabrics together, it was never  contemplated as a sewing machine in the present use of the term. Their  British patent 8,948 stated it was for \"improvements in producing  ornamental or tambour work in the manufacture of gloves.\"    The earliest American patent specifically recorded as a sewing machine  was U.S. patent 2,466, issued to John J. Greenough on February 21, 1842.  His machine was a short-thread model that made both the running stitch  and the backstitch. It used the two-pointed needle, with eye at  mid-length, which was passed back and forth through the material by  means of a pair of pincers on each side of the seam. The pincers opened  and closed automatically. The material to be sewn was held in clamps  which moved it forward between the pincers to form a running stitch or  moved it alternately backward and forward to produce a backstitch. The  clamps were attached to a rack that automatically fed the material at a  predetermined rate according to the length of stitch required. Since the  machine was designed for leather or other hard material, the needle was  preceded by an awl, which pierced a hole. The machine had a weight to  draw out the thread and a stop-motion to stop the machinery when a  thread broke or became too short. The needle was threaded with a short  length of thread and required frequent refilling. Only straight seams  could be stitched. The feed was continuous to the length of the rack  bar; then it had to be reset. The motions were all obtained from the  revolution of a crank. It is not believed that any machines, other than  the patent model (fig. 11), were ever made. Little is known of Greenough  other than his name.    [Illustration: Figure 11.--GREENOUGH'S PATENT MODEL, 1842. (Smithsonian  photo 45525-G.)]    In the succeeding year, on March 4, 1843, Benjamin W. Bean received the  second American sewing-machine patent, U.S. patent 2,982. Like  Greenough's, this machine made a running stitch, but by a different  method. In Bean's machine the fabric was fed between the teeth of a  series of gears. Held in a groove in the gears was a peculiarly shaped  needle bent in two places to permit it to be held in place by the gears  and with a point at one end and the eye at the opposite end, as in a  common hand needle. The action of the gears caused the fabric to be  forced onto and through the threaded needle. Indefinite straight seams  could be stitched as the fabric was continuously forced off the needle  by the turning gears (fig. 12). A screw clamp held the machine to a  table or other work surface. Machines of this and similar types  reportedly had some limited usage in the dyeing and bleaching mills,[27]  where lengths of fabric were stitched together before processing.  Improved versions of Bean's machine were to be patented in subsequent  years in England and America. The same principle was also used in home  machines two decades later.    The third sewing-machine patent on record in the United States Patent  Office is patent 3,389 issued on December 27, 1843, to George H.  Corliss, better remembered as the inventor and manufacturer of the  Corliss steam engine. It was his interest in the sewing machine,  however, that eventually directed his attention to the steam engine.    Corliss had a general store at Greenwich, New York. A customer's  complaint that the boots he had purchased split at the seams made  Corliss wonder why someone had not invented a machine to sew stronger  seams than hand-sewn ones. He considered the problem of sewing leather,  analyzing the steps required to make the saddler's stitch, one popularly  used in boots and shoes. He concluded that a sewing machine to do this  type of work must first perforate the leather, then draw the threads  through the holes, and finally secure the stitches by pulling the  threads tight. The machine Corliss invented (fig. 13) was of the same  general type as Greenough's, except that two two-pointed needles were  required to make the saddler's stitch. This stitch was composed of two  running stitches made simultaneously, one from each side.[28] The  machine used two awls to pierce the holes through which the needles  passed; finger levers approached from opposite sides, seized the  needles, pulled the threads firmly, and passed the needles through to  repeat the operation. The working model that Corliss completed could  unite two pieces of heavy leather at the rate of 20 stitches per minute.    Corliss, lacking capital, went to Providence, Rhode Island, in 1844 to  secure backers. After months without success, he was forced to abandon  the sewing machine and accept employment as a draftsman and designer.  Though he considered himself a failure, this change of employment placed  him on the threshold of his more rewarding life work, improvement of the  steam engine.[29]    On July 22, 1844, James Rodgers was granted U.S. patent 3,672, the  fourth American sewing-machine patent. The patent model is not known to  be in existence, but this machine was of minor importance for it offered  only a negligible change in the Bean running-stitch machine. The same  corrugated gears were used but were placed in different positions so  that one bend in the needle was eliminated. When Bean secured a reissue  of his patent in 1849, he had adapted it to use a straight needle.  Rodgers' machine is not known to have had any commercial success,  although this type of machine experienced a brief period of popularity.  By the early 1900s, however, the running-stitch machine was so little  known that when one was illustrated in the _Sewing Machine Times_ in  1907[30] it excited more curiosity than any of the other early types.    [Illustration: Figure 12.--BEAN'S PATENT MODEL, 1843. (Smithsonian photo  42490-C.)]    [Illustration: Figure 13.--CORLISS' PATENT MODEL, 1843. The piece of  wood in the foreground is an enlarged model of the needle. (Smithsonian  photo 42490.)]    On December 7, 1844, the same year that Rodgers secured his American  patent, John Fisher and James Gibbons were granted British patent 10,424  for \"certain improvements in the manufacture of figured or ornamental  lace, or net, or other fabrics.\" From this superficial description of  its work, the device might seem to be just another tambouring machine.  It was not. Designed specifically for ornamental stitching, the machine  made a two-thread stitch using an eye-pointed needle and a shuttle.[31]  Several sets of needles and shuttles worked simultaneously. The needles  were secured to a needlebar placed beneath the fabric. The shuttles were  pointed at both ends to pass through each succeeding new loop formed by  the needles. Each shuttle was activated by two vibrating arms worked by  cams. Each needle was curved in the form of a bow, and in addition to  the eye at the point each also had a second eye at the bottom of the  curve. The shape of the needle together with the position of the eyes  permitted the pointed shuttle, carrying the second thread, to pass  freely through the loop in the ascending needle thread. The fabric was  carried by a pair of cloth rollers, capable of sliding in a horizontal  plane in both a lateral and a lengthwise direction. These combined  movements were sufficient to enable the operator to produce almost every  embroidered design. The ornamenting, which might be a yarn, cord, or  gimp, was carried by the shuttle thread. There was no tension on the  shuttle thread, which was held in place by the thread from the needle.  The"]]]
