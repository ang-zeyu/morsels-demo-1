Are you too learned now?    I could to tell some word's that I know by heart.    Not apprehend you, the french language is not difficult.    I know it, and she have great deal of agreeableness. Who I would      be. If I was know it! It must to study for to learn it. How long      there is it what you learn it? It is not yet a month. How is      called your master?    It is called N***    I know him it is long; he has teached a many of my friends. Don't      he tell you that it must to speak french?        _For to see the town._      Anthony, go to accompany they gentilsmen, do they see the town.    We won't to see all that is it remarquable here.    Admire this master piece gothic architecture's.    The chasing of all they figures is astonishing indeed.    The streets are very layed out by line and too paved.    There is it also hospitals here?    It not fail them. What are then the edifices the worthest to      have seen?    It is the arsnehal, the spectacle's hall, the cusiom-house and      the Purse.    We are going too see the others monuments such that the public      pawnbroker's office, the plants garden's the money office's,      the library.        _To inform oneself of a person._      How is that gentilman who you did speak by and by.    Is a German.    Tongh he is German, he speak so much well italyan, french, Spanish,    and english, that among the Italyans, they believe him Italyan,    he speak the frenche as the Frenches himselves. The Spanishesmen    belie ve him Spanishing, and the Englishes, Englisman.    It is difficult to enjoy well so much several langages.        _For to ride a horse._      Here is a horse who have a bad looks. Give me another; I will      not that. He not sail know to march, he is pursy, he is foundered.      Don't you are ashamed to give me a jade as like? he is undshoed,      he is with nails up; it want to lead to the farrier.    Your pistols are its loads?    No; I forgot to buy gun-powder and balls. Let us prick. Go us more      fast never I was seen a so much bad beast; she will not nor to      bring forward neither put back.      Strek him the bridle, hold him the reins sharters. Pique      stron gly, make to marsh him.    I have pricked him enough. But I can't to make march him.    Go down, I shall make march.    Take care that he not give you a foot kick's.    Then he kicks for that I look? Sook here if I knew to tame hix.        _With a watch maker._      I bring you a watch that want to be ordered.    I had the misfortune to leave fall down the instant where I did      mounted, it must to put again a glass.      I want not a pendulum? I have them here some very good.      Don't you live me her proof againts? I shall not accept that        this condition.        _For to visit a sick._      How have you passed the night?    Very bad. I have not sleeped; I have had the fever during all      night. I fell some pain every where body.    Live me see your tongue. Have you pain to the heart?    Are you altered?    Yes, I have thursty often.    Your stat have nothing from lrouble some.    What I may to eat?    You can take a broth.    Can I to get up my self?    Yes, during a hour or two.    Let me have another thing to do?    Take care to hold you warme ly, and in two or three days you shall      be cured.        _For to travel._      Where you go so?    I am going to Cadiz.    Have you already arrested a coach?    Yes, sir, and very cheap.    There is it some danger on the highway?    It is not spoken that.    They speak not that may have some robbers on the woods?    It have nothing to fear, or in day neither the night.    Don't we does pass for a***?    No, sir, they leave it to left.    Let us take patience, still some o'clock, and we shall be in the      end of our voyage.        _With a inn keeper._      What you give us for to take supper.    Gentlemen, what you will have.    Give us a pigeon couple, a piece of ham and a salad.    What have us expended?    Theaccout mount in little the supper, the bed and the breakfast,      shall get up at thirty franks.        _From the house-keeping._      I don't know more what I won't with they servants.    I tell the same, it is not more some good servants. Any one take      care to sweep neither to make fire at what I may be up.    How the times are changed! Anciently I had some servants who were      divine my thought. The duty was done at the instant, all things      were cleanly hold one may look on the furnitures now as you do      see. It is too different, whole is covered from dust; the      pierglasses side-boards, the pantries, the chests of drawers, the      walls selves, are changed of colours. I do like-it too much.    Believe me, send again whole the people; I take upon my self to      find you some good servants for to succeed them.    Ah! what I shall be oblige to you of it!        _For the comedy._      Were you go to the theatre yesterday?    Yes, sir; I won't to see the new play in which did owed to play      and actress which has not appeared on any theatre.    How you think her?    She has very much grace in the deeds great deal of exactness on      the declamation, a constitution very agreable, and a delightful      voice.    What you say of the comedy? Have her succeded? It was a drama;      it was whistted to the third scene of the last act.    Because that?    It whant the vehicle, and the intrigue it was bad conducted.    So that they won't waited even the upshot?    No, it was divined.    In the mean time them did diliver justice to the players which      generaly have play very well.    At the exception by a one's self, who had land very much hir's      part.    It want to have not any indulgence towards the bat buffoons.    Have you seen already the new tragedy? They      praise her very much.    It is multitude already.    Never I had seen the parlour so full.    This actor he make very well her part.    That piece is full of interest.    It have wondered the spectadors.    The curtains let down.    Go out us.        _The hunting._      There is it some game in this wood?    Another time there was plenty some black beasts and thin game, but      the poachers have killed almost all.    Look a hare who run! let do him to pursue for the hounds! it go      one's self in the ploughed land.    Here that it rouse. Let aim it! let make fire him!    I have put down killed.    Me, I have failed it; my gun have miss fixe.    I see a hind.    Let leave to pass away, don't disturte it.    I have heard that it is plenty pardridges this year.    Have you killed also some thrushes.    Here certainly a very good hunting.        _The fishing._      That pond it seems me many multiplied of fishes. Let us amuse      rather to the fishing.    Here, there is a wand and some hooks.    Silence! there is a superb perch! Give me quick the rod. Ah!      there is, it is a lamprey. You mistake you, it is a frog! dip      again it in the water.        _With a furniture tradesman._      It seems no me new.    Pardon me, it comes workman's hands.    Which hightness want you its?    I want almost four feet six thumbs wide's, over seven of long.        _For embarking one's self._      Don't you fear the privateers!    I jest of them; my vessel is armed in man of war, I have a      vigilant and courageous equipage, and the ammunitions don't want      me its.    Never have you not done wreck?    That it is arrived me twice.        _With a gardener._      Shall I eat some plums soon?    It is not the season yet; but here is some peaches what does ripen      at the eye sight.    It delay me to eat some wal nuts-kernels; take care not leave to      pass the season.    Be tranquil, I shall throw you any nuts during the shell is green      yet.    The artichoks grow its?    I have a particular care of its, because I know you like the      bottoms.    It must to cup the trees.    It should pull the bad grasses up.        _The books and of the reading._      Do you like the reading good deal too many which seem me?    That is to me a amusement.          _The field._      All the fields that you see thither were been neglected; it must I      shall grub up and to plough its.    The ground seems me a little scour with sand and yet it may one      make it bring up; I want be fumed time by time.        _The writing._      Your pens have any notches, and its spit.    How do you like its? will you its are fine or broad?    I won't me also a wafer or some sealing wax and a seal.    In this drawer, there is all that, falding stick, rule, scraper,      saud, etc.    There is the postman I go to put it him again.        _With a bookseller._      What is there in new's litterature?    Little or almost nothing, it not appears any thing of note.    And yet one imprint many deal.    But why, you and another book seller, you does not to imprint some      good wooks?    There is a reason for that, it is that you cannot to sell its. The      actual-liking of the public is depraved they does not read who      for to amuse one's self ant but to instruct one's.    But the letter's men who cultivate the arts and the sciences they      can't to pass without the books.    A little learneds are happies enough for to may to satisfy their      fancies on the literature.    Have you found the Buff on who I had call for?    I have only been able to procure the octodecimo edition, which is      embellished with plates beautifully coloured.        _With a dentist._      I have the teetht-ache.    Is it a fluxion, or have you a bad tooth?    I think that is a bad tooth; please you to examine my mouth?    You have a bad tooth; will you pull out this tooth?    I can't to decide me it, that make me many great deal pain.    Your tooth is absolutely roted; if you leave it; shall spoil the      others.    In such case draw it.    I shall you neat also your mouth, and you could care entertain it      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30427"],[0,"The Lost Kafoozalum (#4)"],[1,"after four minutes Peter Yeng Sen's  head appears at the top of a stairway and he says the crew is lifting  the deck plates, will we for Time's sake go along to the Conference  Room which is soundproof.           *       *       *       *       *    The Conference Room is on the next deck and like our cabins shows  signs of hasty construction; the soundproofing is there but the  acoustics are kind of muffled and the generator is not boxed in but  has cables trailing all over, and the fastenings have a strong but  temporary look.    Otherwise there is a big table and a lot of chairs and a small  projection box in front of each with a note-taker beside.    It is maybe this very functional setup or maybe the dead flatness of  our voices in the damped room, but we do not have so much to talk  about any more. We automatically take places at the table, all at one  end, leaving seven vacant chairs near the door.    Looking round, I wonder what principle we were selected on.    Of my special friends Eru Te Whangoa and Kirsty Lammergaw are present  but Lily Chen and Likofo Komom'baratse and Jean LeBrun are not; we  have Cray Patterson who is one of my special enemies but not Blazer  Weigh or the Astral Cad; the rest are P. Zapotec, Nick Howard, Aro  Mestah, Dillie Dixie, Pavel Christianovitch, Lennie DiMaggio and  Shootright Crow.    Eru is at the end of the table, opposite the door, and maybe feels  this position puts it up to him to start the discussion; he opens by  remarking \"So nobody took the opportunity to withdraw.\"    Cray Patterson lifts his eyebrows ceilingwards and drawls out that the  decision was supposed to be a private one.    B says \"Maybe but it did not work out that way, everyone who learned  Morse knows who was on the ship, anyway they are all still here so  what does it matter? And M'Clare would not have picked people who were  going to funk it, after all.\"    My chair gets a kick on the ankle which I suppose was meant for B; Eru  is six foot five but even his legs do not quite reach; he is the only  one of us facing the door.    M'Clare has somehow shed his weariness; he looks stern but fresh as a  daisy. There are four with him; Ram and Peter looking serious, one  stranger in Evercleans looking determined to enjoy the party and  another in uniform looking as though nothing would make him.    M'Clare introduces the strangers as Colonel Delano-Smith and Mr.  Yardo. They all sit down at the other end of the table; then he frowns  at us and begins like this:    \"Miss Laydon is mistaken. You were not selected on any such grounds as  she suggests. I may say that I was astonished at the readiness with  which you all engaged yourselves to take part in such a desperate  gamble; and, seeing that for the last four years I have been trying to  persuade you that it is worth while, before making a decision of any  importance, to spend a certain amount of thought on it, I was  discouraged as well.\"    Oh.    \"The criterion upon which you were selected was a very simple one. As  I told you, you were picked not by me but by a computer; the one in  the College Office which registers such information as your home  addresses and present whereabouts. You are simply that section of the  class which could be picked up without attracting attention, because  you all happened to be on holiday by yourselves or with other members  of the class; and because your nearest relatives are not on Earth at  present.\"    Oh, well.    All of us can see M'Clare is doing a job of deflation on us for  reasons of his own, but it works for all that.    He now seems to feel the job is complete and relaxes a bit.    \"I was interested to see that you all, without exception, hit on  variations of the same idea. It is of course the obvious way to deal  with the problem.\" He smiles at us suddenly and I get mad at myself  because I know he is following the rules for introducing a desired  state of mind, but I am responding as meant. \"I'll read you the most  succinct expression of it; you may be able to guess the author.\"    Business with bits of paper.    \"Here it is. I quote: 'Drag in some outsider looks like he is going  for both sides; they will gang up on him.'\"    Yells of laughter and shouts of \"Lizzie Lee!\" even the two strangers  produce sympathetic grins; I do not find it so funny as all that  myself.    \"Ideas as to the form the 'outsider' should take were more varied.  This is a matter I propose to leave you to work out together, with the  assistance of Colonel Delano-Smith and Mr. Yardo. Te Whangoa, you  take the chair.\"    Exit M'Clare.           *       *       *       *       *    This leaves the two halves of the table eying one another. Ram and  Peter have been through this kind of session in their time; now they  are leaning back preparing to watch us work. It is plain we are  supposed to impress the abilities of Russett near-graduates on the two  strangers, and for some moments we are all occupied taking them in.  Colonel Delano-Smith is a small, neat guy with a face that has all the  muscular machinery for producing an expression; he just doesn't care  to use it. Mr. Yardo is taller than any of us except Eru and flesh is  spread very thin on his bones, including his face which splits now and  then in a grin like an affable skeleton. Where the colonel fits is  guessable enough, Mr. Yardo is presumably Expert at something but no  data on _what_.    Eru rests his hands on the table and says we had better start; will  somebody kindly outline an idea for making the Incognitans \"gang up\"?  The simpler the better and it does not matter whether it is workable  or not; pulling it to pieces will give us a start.    We all wait to see who will rush in; then I catch Eru's eye and see I  am elected Clown again. I say \"Send them a letter postmarked Outer  Space signed BEM saying we lost our own planet in a nova and will take  over theirs two weeks from Tuesday.\"    Mr. Yardo utters a sharp \"Ha! Ha!\" but it is not seconded; the  colonel having been expressionless all along becomes more so; Eru  says, \"Thank you, Lizzie.\" He looks across at Cray who is opposite me;  Cray says there are many points on which he might comment; to take  only one, two weeks from Tuesday leaves little time for 'ganging up',  and what happens when the BEMs fail to come?    We are suddenly back in the atmosphere of a seminar; Eru's glance  moves to P. Zapotec sitting next to Cray, and he says, \"These BEMs who  lost their home planet in a nova, how many ships have they? Without a  base they cannot be very dangerous unless their fleet is very large.\"    It goes round the table.    Pavel: \"How would BEMs learn to write?\"    Nick: \"How are they supposed to know that Incognita is inhabited? How  do they address the letter?\"    The Crow: \"Huh. Why write letters? Invaders just invade.\"    Kirsty: \"We don't want to inflame these people against alien races. We  might find one some day. It seems to me this idea might have all sorts  of undesirable by-products. Suppose each side regards it as a ruse on  the part of the other. We might touch off a war instead of preventing  it. Suppose they turn over to preparations for repelling the invaders,  to an extent that cripples their economy? Suppose a panic starts?\"    Dilly: \"Say, Mr. Chairman, is there any of this idea left at all? How  about an interim summary?\"    Eru coughs to get a moment for thought, then says:    \"In brief, the problem is to provide a menace against which the two  groups will be forced to unite. It must have certain characteristics.    \"It must be sufficiently far off in time for the threat to last  several years, long enough to force them into a real combination.    \"It must obviously be a plausible danger and they must get to know of  it in a plausible manner. Invasion from outside is the only threat so  far suggested.    \"It must be a limited threat. That is, it must appear to come from one  well-defined group. The rest of the Universe should appear benevolent  or neutral.\"    He just stops, rather as though there is something else to come; while  the rest of us are waiting B sticks her oar in to the following  effect.    \"Yes, but look, suppose this goes wrong; it's all very well to make  plans but suppose we get some of Kirsty's side-effects just the same,  well what I mean is suppose it makes the mess worse instead of better  we want some way we can sort of switch it off again.    \"Look this is just an illustration, but suppose the Menace was  pirates, if it went wrong we could have an Earth ship make official  contact and they could just happen to say By the way have you seen  anything of some pirates, Earth fleet wiped them up in this sector  about six months ago.    \"That would mean the whole crew conniving, so it won't do, but you  see what I mean.\"    There is a bit of silence, then Aro says, \"I think we should start  fresh. We have had criticisms of Lizzie's suggestion, which was not  perhaps wholly serious, and as Dilly says there is little of it left,  except the idea of a threat of invasion. The idea of an alien  intelligent race has objections and would be very difficult to fake.  The invaders must be men from another planet. Another unknown one. But  how do the people of Incognita come to know that they exist?\"    More silence, then I hear my own voice speaking although it was my  intention to keep quiet for once: it sounds kind of creaky and it  says: \"A ship. A crashed ship from Outside.\"    Whereupon another voice says, \"Really! Am I expected to swallow this?\"           *       *       *       *       *    We had just about forgotten the colonel, not to mention Mr. Yardo who  contributes another \"Ha! Ha!\" so this reminder comes as a slight  shock, nor do we see what he is talking about but this he proceeds to  explain.    \"I don't know why M'Clare thought it necessary to stage this  discussion. I am already acquainted with his plan and have had orders  to co-operate. I have expressed"]]]
