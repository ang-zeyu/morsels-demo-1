And Amis answered again, So truly as an angel  hath spoken to me this night, so may God deliver me from my  infirmity!    \"Then Amile began to weep in secret, and thought within  himself: If this man was ready to die before the king for me, shall  I not for him slay my children?  Shall I not keep faith with him  who was faithful to me even unto death?  And Amile tarried no  longer, but departed to the chamber of his wife, and bade her go  hear the Sacred Office.  And he took a sword, and went to the bed  where the children were lying, and found them asleep.  And he  lay down over them and began to weep bitterly and said, Hath  any man yet heard of a father who of his own will slew his  children?  Alas, my children!  I am no longer your father, but  your cruel murderer.    \"And the children awoke at the tears of their father, which fell  upon them; and they looked up into his face and began to laugh.  And as they were of the age of about three years, he said, Your  laughing will be turned into tears, for your innocent blood must  now be shed, [14] and therewith he cut off their heads.  Then he  laid them back in the bed, and put the heads upon the bodies, and  covered them as though they slept: and with the blood which he  had taken he washed his comrade, and said, Lord Jesus Christ!  who hast commanded men to keep faith on earth, and didst heal  the leper by Thy word!  cleanse now my comrade, for whose love  I have shed the blood of my children.    \"Then Amis was cleansed of his leprosy.  And Amile clothed his  companion in his best robes; and as they went to the church to  give thanks, the bells, by the will of God, rang of their own  accord.  And when the people of the city heard that, they ran  together to see the marvel.  And the wife of Amile, when she saw  Amis and Amile coming, asked which of the twain was her  husband, and said, I know well the vesture of them both, but I  know not which of them is Amile.  And Amile said to her, I am  Amile, and my companion is Amis, who is healed of his sickness.  And she was full of wonder, and desired to know in what manner  he was healed.  Give thanks to our Lord, answered Amile, but  trouble not thyself as to the manner of the healing.    \"Now neither the father nor the mother had yet entered where the  children were; but the father sighed heavily, because they were  dead, and the mother asked for them, that they might rejoice  together; but Amile said, Dame!  let [15] the children sleep.  And  it was already the hour of Tierce.  And going in alone to the  children to weep over them, he found them at play in the bed;  only, in the place of the sword-cuts about their throats was as it  were a thread of crimson.  And he took them in his arms and  carried them to his wife and said, Rejoice greatly, for thy children  whom I had slain by the commandment of the angel are alive,  and by their blood is Amis healed.\"    There, as I said, is the strength of the old French story.  For the  Renaissance has not only the sweetness which it derives from the  classical world, but also that curious strength of which there are  great resources in the true middle age.  And as I have illustrated  the early strength of the Renaissance by the story of Amis and  Amile, a story which comes from the North, in which a certain  racy Teutonic flavour is perceptible, so I shall illustrate that other  element, its early sweetness, a languid excess of sweetness even,  by another story printed in the same volume of the Bibliothèque  Elzevirienne, and of about the same date, a story which comes,  characteristically, from the South, and connects itself with the  literature of Provence.    The central love-poetry of Provence, the poetry of the Tenson and  the Aubade, of Bernard de Ventadour and Pierre Vidal, is poetry  for the few, for the elect and peculiar people of the [16] kingdom  of sentiment.  But below this intenser poetry there was probably a  wide range of literature, less serious and elevated, reaching, by  lightness of form and comparative homeliness of interest, an  audience which the concentrated passion of those higher lyrics  left untouched.  This literature has long since perished, or lives  only in later French or Italian versions.  One such version, the  only representative of its species, M. Fauriel thought he detected  in the story of Aucassin and Nicolette, written in the French of  the latter half of the thirteenth century, and preserved in a unique  manuscript, in the national library of Paris; and there were  reasons which made him divine for it a still more ancient  ancestry, traces in it of an Arabian origin, as in a leaf lost out of  some early Arabian Nights.*  The little book loses none of its  interest through the criticism which finds in it only a traditional  subject, handed on by one people to another; for after passing  thus from hand to hand, its outline is still clear, its surface  untarnished; and, like many other stories, books, literary and  artistic conceptions of the middle age, it has come to [17] have in  this way a sort of personal history, almost as full of risk and  adventure as that of its own heroes.  The writer himself calls the  piece a cantefable, a tale told in prose, but with its incidents and  sentiment helped forward by songs, inserted at irregular intervals.  In the junctions of the story itself there are signs of roughness and  want of skill, which make one suspect that the prose was only put  together to connect a series of songs--a series of songs so moving  and attractive that people wished to heighten and dignify their  effect by a regular framework or setting.  Yet the songs  themselves are of the simplest kind, not rhymed even, but only  imperfectly assonant, stanzas of twenty or thirty lines apiece, all  ending with a similar vowel sound.  And here, as elsewhere in  that early poetry, much of the interest lies in the spectacle of the  formation of a new artistic sense.  A novel art is arising, the  music of rhymed poetry, and in the songs of Aucassin and  Nicolette, which seem always on the point of passing into true  rhyme, but which halt somehow, and can never quite take flight,  you see people just growing aware of the elements of a new  music in their possession, and anticipating how pleasant such  music might become.    The piece was probably intended to be recited by a company of  trained performers, many of whom, at least for the lesser parts,  were probably children.  The songs are introduced by the rubric,  [18] Or se cante (ici on chante); and each division of prose by  the rubric, Or dient et content et fabloient (ici on conte).  The  musical notes of a portion of the songs have been preserved; and  some of the details are so descriptive that they suggested to M.  Fauriel the notion that the words had been accompanied  throughout by dramatic action.  That mixture of simplicity and  refinement which he was surprised to find in a composition of the  thirteenth century, is shown sometimes in the turn given to some  passing expression or remark; thus, \"the Count de Garins was old  and frail, his time was over\"--Li quens Garins de Beaucaire  estoit vix et frales; si avoit son tans trespassè.  And then, all is so  realised!  One sees the ancient forest, with its disused roads  grown deep with grass, and the place where seven roads meet--u  a forkeut set cemin qui s'en vont par le païs; we hear the light-  hearted country people calling each other by their rustic names,  and putting forward, as their spokesman, one among them who is  more eloquent and ready than the rest--li un qui plus fu enparlés  des autres; for the little book has its burlesque element also, so  that one hears the faint, far-off laughter still.  Rough as it is, the  piece certainly possesses this high quality of poetry, that it aims  at a purely artistic effect.  Its subject is a great sorrow, yet it  claims to be a thing of joy and refreshment, to be entertained not  for its matter only, but chiefly for its manner, it is cortois, it tells  us, et bien assis.    [19] For the student of manners, and of the old French language  and literature, it has much interest of a purely antiquarian order.  To say of an ancient literary composition that it has an  antiquarian interest, often means that it has no distinct aesthetic  interest for the reader of to-day.  Antiquarianism, by a purely  historical effort, by putting its object in perspective, and setting  the reader in a certain point of view, from which what gave  pleasure to the past is pleasurable for him also, may often add  greatly to the charm we receive from ancient literature.  But the  first condition of such aid must be a real, direct, aesthetic charm  in the thing itself.  Unless it has that charm, unless some purely  artistic quality went to its original making, no merely antiquarian  effort can ever give it an aesthetic value, or make it a proper  subject of aesthetic criticism.  This quality, wherever it exists, it  is always pleasant to define, and discriminate from the sort of  borrowed interest which an old play, or an old story, may very  likely acquire through a true antiquarianism.  The story of  Aucassin and Nicolette has something of this quality.  Aucassin,  the only son of Count Garins of Beaucaire, is passionately in love  with Nicolette, a beautiful girl of unknown parentage, bought of  the Saracens, whom his father will not permit him to marry.  The  story turns on the adventures of these two lovers, until at the end  of the piece their mutual fidelity is rewarded.  These [20]  adventures are of the simplest sort, adventures which seem to be  chosen for the happy occasion they afford of keeping the eye of  the fancy, perhaps the outward eye, fixed on pleasant objects, a  garden, a ruined tower, the little hut of flowers which Nicolette  constructs in the forest whither she escapes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4065"],[0,"Side-Lights on Astronomy and Kindred Fields of Popular Science (#4)"],[1,"was  supposed to be caused by the attraction of an unknown planet between  Mercury and the sun, and some were so sure of the existence of this  planet that they gave it a name, calling it Vulcan. But of late years  it has become reasonably certain that no planet large enough to produce  the effect observed can be there. So thoroughly has every possible  explanation been sifted out and found wanting, that some astronomers  are now inquiring whether the law of gravitation itself may not be a  little different from what has always been supposed. A very slight  deviation, indeed, would account for the facts, but cautious  astronomers want other proofs before regarding the deviation of  gravitation as an established fact.    Intelligent men have sometimes inquired how, after devoting so much  work to the study of the heavens, anything can remain for astronomers  to find out. It is a curious fact that, although they were never  learning so fast as at the present day, yet there seems to be more to  learn now than there ever was before. Great and numerous as are the  unsolved problems of our science, knowledge is now advancing into  regions which, a few years ago, seemed inaccessible. Where it will stop  none can say.          II    THE NEW PROBLEMS OF THE UNIVERSE      The achievements of the nineteenth century are still a theme of  congratulation on the part of all who compare the present state of the  world with that of one hundred years ago. And yet, if we should fancy  the most sagacious prophet, endowed with a brilliant imagination, to  have set forth in the year 1806 the problems that the century might  solve and the things which it might do, we should be surprised to see  how few of his predictions had come to pass. He might have fancied  aerial navigation and a number of other triumphs of the same class, but  he would hardly have had either steam navigation or the telegraph in  his picture. In 1856 an article appeared in Harper's Magazine depicting  some anticipated features of life in A.D. 3000. We have since made  great advances, but they bear little resemblance to what the writer  imagined. He did not dream of the telephone, but did describe much that  has not yet come to pass and probably never will.    The fact is that, much as the nineteenth century has done, its last  work was to amuse itself by setting forth more problems for this  century to solve than it has ever itself succeeded in mastering. We  should not be far wrong in saying that to-day there are more riddles in  the universe than there were before men knew that it contained anything  more than the objects they could see.    So far as mere material progress is concerned, it may be doubtful  whether anything so epoch-making as the steam-engine or the telegraph  is held in store for us by the future. But in the field of purely  scientific discovery we are finding a crowd of things of which our  philosophy did not dream even ten years ago.    The greatest riddles which the nineteenth century has bequeathed to us  relate to subjects so widely separated as the structure of the universe  and the structure of atoms of matter. We see more and more of these  structures, and we see more and more of unity everywhere, and yet new  facts difficult of explanation are being added more rapidly than old  facts are being explained.    We all know that the nineteenth century was marked by a separation of  the sciences into a vast number of specialties, to the subdivisions of  which one could see no end. But the great work of the twentieth century  will be to combine many of these specialties. The physical philosopher  of the present time is directing his thought to the demonstration of  the unity of creation. Astronomical and physical researches are now  being united in a way which is bringing the infinitely great and the  infinitely small into one field of knowledge. Ten years ago the atoms  of matter, of which it takes millions of millions to make a drop of  water, were the minutest objects with which science could imagine  itself to be concerned, Now a body of experimentalists, prominent among  whom stand Professors J. J. Thompson, Becquerel, and Roentgen, have  demonstrated the existence of objects so minute that they find their  way among and between the atoms of matter as rain-drops do among the  buildings of a city. More wonderful yet, it seems likely, although it  has not been demonstrated, that these little things, called  \"corpuscles,\" play an important part in what is going on among the  stars. Whether this be true or not, it is certain that there do exist  in the universe emanations of some sort, producing visible effects, the  investigation of which the nineteenth century has had to bequeath to  the twentieth.    For the purpose of the navigator, the direction of the magnetic needle  is invariable in any one place, for months and even years; but when  exact scientific observations on it are made, it is found subject to  numerous slight changes. The most regular of these consists in a daily  change of its direction. It moves one way from morning until noon, and  then, late in the afternoon and during the night, turns back again to  its original pointing. The laws of this change have been carefully  studied from observations, which show that it is least at the equator  and larger as we go north into middle latitudes; but no explanation of  it resting on an indisputable basis has ever been offered.    Besides these regular changes, there are others of a very irregular  character. Every now and then the changes in the direction of the  magnet are wider and more rapid than those which occur regularly every  day. The needle may move back and forth in a way so fitful as to show  the action of some unusual exciting cause. Such movements of the needle  are commonly seen when there is a brilliant aurora. This connection  shows that a magnetic storm and an aurora must be due to the same or  some connected causes.    Those of us who are acquainted with astronomical matters know that the  number of spots on the sun goes through a regular cycle of change,  having a period of eleven years and one or two months. Now, the curious  fact is, when the number and violence of magnetic storms are recorded  and compared, it is found that they correspond to the spots on the sun,  and go through the same period of eleven years. The conclusion seems  almost inevitable: magnetic storms are due to some emanation sent out  by the sun, which arises from the same cause that produces the spots.  This emanation does not go on incessantly, but only in an occasional  way, as storms follow each other on the earth. What is it? Every  attempt to detect it has been in vain. Professor Hale, at the Yerkes  Observatory, has had in operation from time to time, for several years,  his ingenious spectroheliograph, which photographs the sun by a single  ray of the spectrum. This instrument shows that violent actions are  going on in the sun, which ordinary observation would never lead us to  suspect. But it has failed to show with certainty any peculiar  emanation at the time of a magnetic storm or anything connected with  such a storm.    A mystery which seems yet more impenetrable is associated with the  so-called new stars which blaze forth from time to time. These offer to  our sight the most astounding phenomena ever presented to the physical  philosopher. One hundred years ago such objects offered no mystery.  There was no reason to suppose that the Creator of the universe had  ceased His functions; and, continuing them, it was perfectly natural  that He should be making continual additions to the universe of stars.  But the idea that these objects are really new creations, made out of  nothing, is contrary to all our modern ideas and not in accord with the  observed facts. Granting the possibility of a really new star--if such  an object were created, it would be destined to take its place among  the other stars as a permanent member of the universe. Instead of this,  such objects invariably fade away after a few months, and are changed  into something very like an ordinary nebula. A question of transcendent  interest is that of the cause of these outbursts. It cannot be said  that science has, up to the present time, been able to offer any  suggestion not open to question. The most definite one is the collision  theory, according to which the outburst is due to the clashing together  of two stars, one or both of which might previously have been dark,  like a planet. The stars which may be actually photographed probably  exceed one hundred millions in number, and those which give too little  light to affect the photographic plate may be vastly more numerous than  those which do. Dark stars revolve around bright ones in an infinite  variety of ways, and complex systems of bodies, the members of which  powerfully attract each other, are the rule throughout the universe.  Moreover, we can set no limit to the possible number of dark or  invisible stars that may be flying through the celestial spaces. While,  therefore, we cannot regard the theory of collision as established, it  seems to be the only one yet put forth which can lay any claim to a  scientific basis. What gives most color to it is the extreme suddenness  with which the new stars, so far as has yet been observed, invariably  blaze forth. In almost every case it has been only two or three days  from the time that the existence of such an object became known until  it had attained nearly its full brightness. In fact, it would seem that  in the case of the star in Perseus, as in most other cases, the greater  part of the outburst took place within the space of twenty-four hours.  This suddenness and rapidity is exactly what would be the result of a  collision.    The most inexplicable feature of all is the rapid formation of a nebula  around this star. In the first photographs of the latter, the  appearance presented is simply"]]]
