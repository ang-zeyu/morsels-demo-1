[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35006"],[0,"An Experimental Translocation of the Eastern Timber Wolf (#4)"],[1,"or agonistic social interactions of consequence  were observed among the wolves while penned in Michigan, from March 5 to  12. Animals 11, 12 and 13 would lie down and feed together in various  combinations. No. 10 was less active than the others and often stayed  inside a shelter box within the enclosure, but would come out and mix  with the other wolves for brief periods when humans were not in  evidence. Her actions were indicative of a low ranking, immature,  distressed, or alien animal.    Male No. 12 was the only wolf that would stare directly at a person  approaching the pen. He was bolder and more direct in his actions than  any of the other animals. This is the wolf that mated with adult female  No. 11 while penned in Minnesota, and thus can be considered the \"alpha  male,\" or pack leader.    When approached by humans, all the wolves would urinate and defecate;  No. 11 and 12 would pace, No. 10 (when out of the shelter box) and No.  13 would lie in the far corner of the pen and remain motionless (Fig.  14). No. 11 limped on her right front foot throughout the penned period,  but this limp did not appear to have a significant effect on her  activities or movements.    Blood samples taken on March 5, 1974 were analyzed and interpreted by  Dr. U. S. Seal of the Veterans Administration Hospital in Minneapolis.  The assays performed included hematology, 16 blood chemistries,  thryoxine, and cortisol (Seal et al., 1975), plus estrogen and  progesterone. According to Seal (personal communication), all blood  values for wolves No. 10, 12, and 13 were similar and indicative of good  health and minimal stress, as indicated by very low levels of the  enzymes LDH, CPK, and SGOT. Such levels are typical of animals in a  state of good nutrition that have been in captivity for several weeks  and have accepted their captive circumstances. The MCV's were normal,  indicating no vitamin deficiency, and the MCHC showed full hemoglobin  content in the red cells, indicating no lack of iron. The white blood  cell counts were much lower than usually seen in newly trapped wolves.  All the remaining chemistry values from these three wolves were in the  normal range for the season.    [Illustration: _Fig. 14.--The Minnesota wolves in their Michigan pen  (Photo by Tom Weise)_]    Wolf No. 11, however, differed in that she had a much higher hemoglobin  level, higher blood glucose and white cell count, and higher levels of  LDH, CPK, and SGOT, indicating that she was significantly stressed. This  is corroborated by a low thyroxine level of 0.6 micrograms percent,  which is hypothyroid for wolves.    The fibrinogen levels of all four animals were normal, indicating that  there was no acute or chronic inflammation in progress.    The wolves ate well in captivity but still lost from 11% to 20% of their  capture weight (Table 2). Himes estimated that they consumed an average  of 8 lb. (3.6 kg) of food per wolf per day, while penned in Minnesota.  In Michigan the wolves consumed about a deer and a half, or an estimated  5.5 lb. (2.5 kg) per wolf per day. These estimates fall within the range  of food consumption figures estimated for wolves in the wild (Mech and  Frenzel 1971). After the wolves began feeding on the first carcass, they  completely consumed it before starting a second one, even though four  carcasses were available; they ate nothing from the other two carcasses.    We released the wolves at dusk on March 12, 1974. Having just restrained  Wolf No. 10 without drugs, to replace her collar, we untied her and let  her free; she bounded off northwestward. We then opened the pen, and No.  12, whom we had judged to be the alpha male, left in less than 5 minutes  and trotted off steadily toward the west-southwest. The remaining two  animals paced around the pen for about 5 minutes and then lay down.  Because we felt that they might become too widely separated from the  others, three of us approached the pen opposite the door to encourage  the wolves to find the open gate. Five minutes later No. 13 left the pen  running southwestward, and No. 11 left less than 5 minutes later. Upon  exiting, No. 11 appeared to smell the track of No. 12 and slowly trotted  in his direction.                                  Aerial Tracking    Our success in locating the translocated wolves by aerial radio-tracking  was 95% (Table 3), similar to that of Mech and Frenzel (1971) working  with wolves in their native range in Minnesota.    During the part of the study in which extensive snow cover was present  (March 13 to April 20) wolves No. 11, 12, and 13 were observed 14 times  from the aircraft. The first time they were seen, near Laws Lake, they  appeared alarmed and moved into heavy cover. The next day, however, and  on all subsequent observations, the aircraft appeared to have little  effect on their behavior, although they sometimes looked up at it. No.  10 was seen only once by a passenger in the tracking aircraft, and she  immediately hid from view. It seems likely that she avoided the  aircraft. After the snow melted and leaves appeared, we no longer saw  the wolves.    The activities of the three wolves during the 14 aerial observations  were as follows: traveling 4 (Fig. 15), feeding and scavenging 5 (Fig.  16), resting 4, and sleeping 1.    _Table 3.

Smith)_]                        Movements of the Translocated Wolves    Wolf No. 10 never joined any of the other radioed wolves after their  release, whereas the others generally remained as a pack. Thus the  movements of the pack will be described separately from those of lone  wolf No. 10.    Four phases were seen in the movements of the pack: (1) Post-Release  Phase, March 12 to 14; (2) Directional Movement Phase, March 15 to 24;  (3) Exploratory Phase, March 25 to May 7, and (4) Settled Phase, May 7  to July 6.      Post-Release Phase    This first phase of the wolves' movements, including the first 2 days  after release, seemed to be characterized by confusion and indecision.  On March 13, the morning after the release, the three wolves were  separated, but all remained within 2.0 miles (3.2 km) south to west of  the release site, the general direction in which they had headed upon  release (Fig. 17). No. 11 and 13 were about a half-mile (0.8 km) apart  in the morning, and by late afternoon, No. 13 apparently had joined No.  11. No. 12 remained about 2 miles away from the others all day, although  he did move about a half-mile during the day. By the 14th, No. 11 and 13  had moved 2 miles southwestward, but were separated by a half-mile; No.  12 had moved only a half-mile west.      Directional Movement Phase    During this phase, all three wolves left the immediate vicinity of the  release point and headed southwestward. Early in this phase, wolves No.  11 and 13 rejoined (by March 15) and traveled 9 miles (14.5 km)  west-southwest of their previous day's location, while No. 12 took a  more northerly route. Nevertheless, by March 19, No. 12 had joined the  other two wolves near Skanee, some 14 miles (22.5 km) west-southwest of  the release point (Fig. 17). For the next several weeks these wolves all  remained together and travelled a straight-line distance of about 40  miles (64.1 km) to a point just north of Prickett Dam about 11 miles  (17.6 km) west-southwest of L'Anse, arriving there on March 24 (Fig.  17).      Exploratory Phase    In the Exploratory Phase of their movements, from March 25 to May 7,  wolves No. 11, 12, and 13 covered a 1,631-square-mile (4,224 km^2) area  from the town of Atlantic Mine on the Keweenaw Peninsula to the north to  a point about 64 miles (103.0 km) south, near Gibbs City (Fig. 18). In  the opposite dimension, they ranged from Keweenaw Bay on the east to 9  miles (14.5 km) south of Ontonagon, 42 miles (67.6 km) west of there.  This phase was characterized by long movements, considerable  zigzagging, and revisiting of certain general regions such as the base  of the Keweenaw Peninsula and areas east and north of Kenton (Fig. 18).    An interesting social change also occurred during this phase: No. 13  split from the pack sometime after April 26 when the pack had reached  its westernmost location, south of Ontonagon. Whereas No. 11 and 12  returned east-northeastward toward Otter Lake, where they had been in  late March, No. 13 headed west-northwestward to the Porcupine Mountains,  18 miles (30.0 km) west of where the pack had last been located together  (Fig. 18). Thus on May 2, Wolf No. 13 was 51 miles (82.0 km) west of No.  11 and No. 12. Nevertheless, 5 days later all the wolves were found near  Gibbs City, 62 miles (99.8 km) southwest of the Porcupine Mountains, and  45 miles (72.4 km) south of Otter Lake; No. 13 was only 6 miles (9.7 km)  from his packmates. The next time an attempt could be made to locate the  wolves, on May 16, they had reunited.      Settled Phase    This last phase of the wolves' movements includes the period when the  animals had settled into an area similar to the size of home ranges  reported for other wolves in the Great Lakes Region (Mech 1970).

V    HOW A FLICKER FEEDS HER YOUNG[1]      [Footnote 1: Based upon the observations of Mr. William Brewster.]    As the house of the woodpecker has no windows and the old bird very  nearly fills the doorway when she comes home, it is hard to find out  just how she feeds her little ones. But one of our best naturalists has  had the opportunity to observe it, and has told what he saw.    A flicker had built a nest in the trunk of a rather small dead tree  which, after the eggs were hatched, was accidentally broken off just at  the entrance hole. This left the whole cavity exposed to the weather;  but it was too late to desert the nest, and impossible to remove the  young birds to another nest.    When first visited, the five little birds were blind, naked, and  helpless. They were motherless, too. Some one must have killed their  pretty mother; for she never came to feed them, and the father was  taking all the care of his little family. When disturbed the little  birds hissed like snakes, as is the habit of the callow young of  woodpeckers, chickadees, and other birds nesting habitually in holes in  trees. When they were older and their eyes were open, they made a  clatter much like the noise of a mowing-machine, and loud enough to be  heard thirty yards away.    The father came at intervals of from twenty to sixty minutes to feed the  little ones. He was very shy, and came so quietly that he would be first  seen when he alighted close by with a low little laugh or a subdued but  anxious call to the young. \"Here I am again!\" he laughed; or \"Are you  all right, children?\" he called to them. \"All right!\" they would answer,  clattering in concert like a two-horse mower.    As soon as they heard him scratching on the tree-trunk, up they would  all clamber to the edge of the nest and hold out their gaping mouths to  be fed. Each one was anxious to be fed first, because there never was  enough to go round. There was always one that, like the little pig of  the nursery tale, \"got none.\" When he came to the nest, the father would  look around a moment, trying to choose the one he wanted to feed first.  Did he always pick out the poor little one that had none the time  before, I wonder?    After the old bird had made his choice, he would bend over the little  bird and drive his long bill down the youngster's throat as if to run  it through him. Then the little bird would catch hold as tightly as he  could and hang on while his father jerked him up and down for a second  or a second and a half with great rapidity. What was he doing? He was  pumping food from his own stomach into the little one's. Many birds feed  their young in this way. They do not hold the food in their own mouths,  but swallow and perhaps partially digest it, so that it shall be fit for  the tender little stomachs.    While the woodpecker was pumping in this manner his motions were much  the same as when he drummed, but his tail twitched as rapidly as his  head and his wings quivered. The motion seemed to shake his whole body.    In two weeks from the time when the little birds were blind, naked,  helpless nestlings they became fully feathered and full grown, able to  climb up to the top of the nest, from which they looked out with  curiosity and interest. At any noise they would slip silently back. A  day or two later they left the old nest and began their journeys.    No naturalist has been able to tell us whether other woodpeckers than  the golden-winged flicker feed their young in this way; and little is  known of the number of kinds of birds that use this method, but it is  suspected that it is far more common than has ever been determined. If  an old bird is seen to put her bill down a young one's throat and keep  it there even so short a time as a second, it is probable that she is  feeding the little one by regurgitation, that is, by pumping up food  from her own stomach. Any bird seen doing this should be carefully  watched. It has long been known that the domestic pigeon does this, and  the same has been observed a number of times of the ruby-throated  hummingbird. A California lady has taken some remarkable photographs of  the Anna's hummingbird in the act, showing just how it is done.          VI    FRIEND DOWNY      No better little bird comes to our orchards than our friend the downy  woodpecker. He is the smallest and one of the most sociable of our  woodpeckers,--a little, spotted, black-and-white fellow, precisely like  his larger cousin the hairy, except in having the outer tail-feathers  barred instead of plain. Nearly everything that can be said of one is  equally true of the other on a smaller scale. They look alike, they act  alike, and their nests and eggs are alike in everything but size.    Downy is the most industrious of birds. He is seldom idle and never in  mischief. As he does not fear men, but likes to live in orchards and in  the neighborhood of fields, he is a good friend to us. On the farm he  installs himself as Inspector of Apple-trees. It is an old and an  honorable profession among birds. The pay is small, consisting only of  what can be picked up, but, as cultivated trees are so infested with  insects that food is always plentiful, and as they have usually a  dead branch suitable to nest in, Downy asks no more. Summer and winter  he works on our orchards. At sunrise he begins, and he patrols the  branches till sunset. He taps on the trunks to see whether he can hear  any rascally borers inside. He inspects every tree carefully in a  thorough and systematic way, beginning low down and following up with a  peek into every crevice and a tap upon every spot that looks suspicious.  If he sees anything which ought not to be there, he removes it at once.    [Illustration]    A moth had laid her eggs in a crack in the bark, expecting to hatch out  a fine brood of caterpillars: but Downy ate them all, thus saving a  whole branch from being overrun with caterpillars and left fruitless,  leafless, and dying. A beetle had just deposited her eggs here. Downy  saw her, and took not only the eggs but the beetle herself. Those eggs  would have hatched into boring larvae, which would have girdled and  killed some of the branches, or have burrowed under the bark, causing it  to fall off, or have bored into the wood and, perhaps, have killed the  tree. Nor is the full-grown borer exempt. Downy hears him, pecks a few  strokes, and harpoons him with unerring aim. When Downy has made an  arrest in this way, the prisoner does not escape from the police. Here  is a colony of ants, running up the tree in one line and down in  another, touching each other with their feelers as they pass. A feast  for our friend! He takes both columns, and leaves none to tell the tale.  This is a good deed, too, since ants are of no benefit to fruit-trees  and are very fond of the dead-ripe fruit.    And Downy is never too busy to listen for borers. They are fine plump  morsels much to his taste, not so sour as ants, nor so hard-shelled as  beetles, nor so insipid as insects' eggs. A good borer is his preferred  dainty. The work he does in catching borers is of incalculable benefit,  for no other bird can take his place. The warblers, the vireos, and some  other birds in summer, the chickadees and nuthatches all the year round,  are helping to eat up the eggs and insects that lie near the surface,  but the only birds equipped for digging deep under the bark and dragging  forth the refractory grubs are the woodpeckers.    So Downy works at his self-appointed task in our orchards summer and  winter, as regular as a policeman on his beat. But he is much more than  a policeman, for he acts as judge, jury, jailer, and jail. All the  evidence he asks against any insect is to find him loafing about the  premises. \"I swallow him first and find out afterwards whether he was  guilty,\" says Downy with a wink and a nod.    Most birds do not stay all the year, in the North, at least, and most,  in return for their labors in the spring, demand some portion of the  fruit or grain of midsummer and autumn. Not so Downy. His services are  entirely gratuitous; he works twice as long as most others. He spends  the year with us, no winter ever too severe for him, no summer too hot;  and he never taxes the orchard, nor takes tribute from the berry patch.  Only a quarter of his food is vegetable, the rest being made up of  injurious insects; and the vegetable portion consists entirely of wild  fruits and weed-seeds, nothing that man eats or uses. Downy feeds on the  wild dogwood berries, a few pokeberries, the fruit of the woodbine, and  the seeds of the poison-ivy,--whatever scanty and rather inferior fare  is to be had at Nature's fall and winter table. If in the cold winter  weather we will take pains to hang out a bone with some meat on it, raw  or cooked, or a piece of suet, taking care that it is not salted,--for  few wild birds except the crossbills can eat salted food,--we may see  how he appreciates our thoughtfulness. Shall we grudge him a bone from  our own abundance, or neglect to fasten it firmly out of reach of the  cat and dog? If his cousin the hairy and his neighbor the chickadee  come and eat with him, bid them a hearty welcome. The feast is spread  for all the birds that help men, and friend Downy shall be their host.          VII    PERSONA NON GRATA      We shall not attempt to deny that Downy has an unprincipled relative.  While it is no discredit, it is a great misfortune to Downy, who is  often murdered merely because he looks a little, a very little, like  this disreputable cousin of his. The real offender is the sapsucker,  that musical genius of whom we have already spoken.    The popular belief is that every woodpecker is a sapsucker, and that  every hole he digs in a tree is an injury to the tree. We have seen that  every"]]]
