Two of these, _Notemigonus crysoleucas_ and _Chaenobryttus  gulosus_, may have been introduced by man. The remaining three,  _Hybopsis biguttata_, _Noturus exilis_ and _Percina caprodes_, have not  been taken farther west than Mill Creek, Wabaunsee County. In general  the faunas of the two systems are similar; forty species are common to  both.    Comparison of the faunal list reported from the Cottonwood River  drainage (Arkansas River System) by Cross (1954) with that here  reported reveals 26 species in common, 19 found only in the Wakarusa  and 15 species found only in the Cottonwood.      _Acknowledgments_        We thank Dr. Frank Cross, Mr. Bernard Nelson and Mr. Wendell      Minckley for their suggestions and data, and Mrs. James E.

God bless the man! What else have the poor girls to do?  Sappho has a taste for dainty clothes and a love for the theatre; she  fills her empty existence with these things as far as she can; Juno has  nothing in the wide world to do all day long, but she loves the open  air, and so concentrates her magnificent energies on a game with a stick  and ball, because any active part in the great game of life is denied  her. Marry her--if she will have you--and see what a grand comrade she  will make, and what splendid children she will bear you. Or marry  Sappho, and you will find she will never want any but simple pleasures  within your means, as long as you are kind to her and adore her as she  requires to be adored. She will cheerfully make her own clothes, and  find her greatest joy in planning out your income and adorning your  home.    Everyone can recall having known frivolous and pleasure-loving girls  settle down into admirable wives whose nurseries are models and whose  households are beyond reproach. Doubtless their friends all predicted  disaster when these butterflies were led to the altar. I honestly  believe women only want extravagant pleasures when they are miserable.  It is generally the wretched wives, the unhappy, restless spinsters who  run up bills and fling away money. They feel that life is cheating them  and they must have some compensations.    But to return to my fifteen bachelors. There only remains Florizel,  whose attitude towards wedlock is a blend of that of Bayard and  Claudian. He is genuinely eager to marry, ardent, affectionate, anxious  to do right, but lacking in moral courage and egotistical to the point  of disease. I would much like to see him happily wedded, as he then  would doubtless quickly lose that intense self-centredness, but I  question if any attractive woman exists who would be unselfish enough to  cope with him in his present state of egomania. His mind is always  inflamed with some woman or other, and he hovers about on the edge of  desperate _amours_, anxious to fall head over ears into the sea of love  and cast out an anchor of matrimony to hold him fast where he can swerve  no more. Unfortunately he cannot forget himself enough to take the fatal  plunge. With all his faults there is something very lovable about  Florizel, and I should like to see him knocked into shape, though it  would be a brave and patient woman who would take the task in hand.    When all the fifteen bachelors had ceased to talk about themselves and  settled down to bridge with the rest of the company, an old lady who,  like myself, preferred to be a looker-on, came and sat beside me. 'How  they _do_ talk,' she said! 'But I can tell you why they don't marry, in  six words, my dear: because they don't fall in love! And why don't they  fall in love? Because the girls are too eager; because the girls meet  them all the way--that's why! I've seven sons, all unmarried, and _I_  know!'       *   *   *    NOTE.--It is interesting to note that Westermarck in his _History of  Human Marriage_ quotes a number of authorities to prove that among many  ancient nations marriage was a religious duty incumbent upon all. Among  Mohammedan people generally it is still considered a duty. Hebrew  celibacy was unheard of, and they have a proverb, 'He who has no wife is  no man.' In Egypt it is improper and even disreputable for a man to  abstain from marriage when there is no just impediment. For an adult to  die unmarried is regarded as a deplorable misfortune by the Chinese,  and among the Hindus of the present day a man who remains single is  considered to be almost a useless member of society, and is looked upon  as beyond the pale of nature.            III      WHY WOMEN DON'T MARRY      'It's a woman's business to get married as soon as possible and a    man's to remain unmarried as long as he can.' --G. BERNARD SHAW.      'Marriage is of so much use to a woman, opens out to her so much    of life, and puts her in the way of so much more freedom and    usefulness, that whether she marry ill or well, she can hardly    miss some benefit.' --R. L. STEVENSON.      'Why women don't marry? But they do--whenever they can!' the intelligent  reader will naturally exclaim. Not 'whenever they get the chance,' mark  you; no _intelligent_ reader would make this mistake, though it is a  common enough error among the non-comprehending. Most spinsters over  thirty must have winced at one time or another at the would-be genial  rallying of some elderly man relative: 'What! you not married yet? Well,  well, I wonder what all the young men are thinking of.' I write _some  man_ advisedly, for no woman, however cattishly inclined, however  desirous of planting arrows in a rival's breast, would utter this  peculiarly deadly form of insult, which, strangely enough, is always  intended as a high compliment by the masculine blunderer. The fact that  the unfortunate spinster thus assailed may have had a dozen offers, and  yet, for reasons of her own, prefer to remain single, seems entirely  beyond their range of comprehension.    But the main reason why women don't marry is obviously because men don't  ask them. Most women will accept when a sufficiently pleasing man offers  them a sufficiently congenial life. If the offers they receive fall  below a certain standard, then they prefer to remain single, wistfully  hoping, no doubt, that the right man may come along before it is too  late. The preservation of the imaginative faculty in women, to which I  have previously alluded, doubtless accounts for many spinsters. It must  also be remembered that the more educated women become, the less likely  they are to marry for marrying's sake as their grandmothers did.    Then there are a few women, quite a small section, who, unless they can  realise their ideal in its entirety, will not be content with second  best. By an irony of fate, it happens that these are often the noblest  of their sex. Yet another small section remain single from an honest  dislike of marriage and its duties. It is perhaps not too severe to say  that a woman who has absolutely no vocation for wifehood and motherhood  must be a degenerate, and so lacking in the best feminine instincts as  to deserve the reproach of being 'sexless.' This type is apparently  increasing! I shall deal with it further in Part IV.    Then there are those--I should not like to make a guess at their  number--who will marry _any_ man, however undesirable and uncongenial,  rather than be left 'withering on the stalk.' It is an acutely  humiliating fact that there exists no man too ugly, too foolish, too  brutal, too conceited and too vile to find a wife. _Any_ man can find  _some_ woman to wed him. In this connection, one recalls the famous  cook, who, when condoled with on the defection of a lover, replied:  'It don't matter; thank God I can love any man!'    One cannot help being amused by the serious articles on this subject in  feminine journals. We are gravely told that women don't marry nowadays  because they price their liberty too high, because those who have money  prefer to be independent and enjoy life, and those who have none prefer  bravely wringing a living from the world to being a man's slave, a mere  drudge, entirely engrossed in housekeeping, etc., etc.; and so on--pages  of it! All this may possibly be true of a very small portion of the  community, but the uncontrovertible fact remains that the principal  reason for woman's spinsterhood is man's indifference.    I have every sympathy with the women who wish to postpone taking up the  heavy responsibilities of matrimony till they have had what in the  opposite sex is termed 'a fling,' that is until they have enjoyed a  period of freedom wherein to study, to travel, to enjoy their youth  fully, to meet many men, to look life in the eyes and learn something of  its meaning. But there comes a period in the life of almost every  woman--except the aforesaid degenerate--when she feels it is time to  'put away childish things,' and into her heart there steals a longing  for the real things of life--the things that matter, the things that  last--wedded love and little children, and that priceless possession,  a home of one's own.    It is the fashion nowadays to discredit the home, and it has been  jestingly alluded to by Mr Bernard Shaw as 'the girl's prison and the  woman's workhouse;' but what a wonderful sanctuary it really is!--and  exactly how much it means to a woman, only those who have felt the need  of it can tell. In our youth, home is the place where hampers come from,  where string and stamps and magazines grow on the premises, a place  generally where love is, but nevertheless essentially a place we take  for granted and for which we never dream of being grateful. Later on it  is sometimes associated with irksome duties; to some it even becomes a  place to get away from; but when we have lost it, how we long for it!  How reverently we think of each room and the things that happened there;  how we yearn in thought over the old garden and dream about the beloved  trees. No matter how mean a home it may have been, every bit of it is  sacred and dear--from the box-room, where on wet days we played at  robbers, to the toolshed, where on fine days we played at everything  under the sun. To this day if I chance on a badly-cooked potato it  almost brings tears to my eyes, not because of its badness, but because  it recalls the potatoes that three small children used to cook with  gladness and eat with silent awe, in the ashes of a bonfire, in an old  garden, long, long ago--whilst the smell of a bonfire itself makes me  feel seven years old again!    But whether she has a home with her parents or not, every normal woman  longs for a home of her own, and a girl who resents even arranging the "]]]
