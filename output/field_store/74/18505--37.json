As for myself, I heartily believe and fully accept the statement of the  inspired bard of Israel concerning the problem of force and life: \"With  thee is the fountain of life.\" God the author of life and the source of  all the force in the universe. I do not for one moment believe the  teaching of my learned skeptical professor of physiology, Sanford E.  Chaillei, that life is the result of organization; that digestion is a  chemical process; and that animal heat and force result from this  process. His favorite illustration was the steam engine. The fuel in the  fire-box generated the heat which made the water in the boiler boil, and  thus the _steam force_ was produced that moved the boat on the river.  But, unfortunately for this illustration the Professor always left out  of the consideration the fireman. No amount of fuel and water would ever  generate force sufficient to turn a wheel without a fireman to light the  fuel. So no amount of bread and meat in a man's stomach would ever  generate enough force to produce a single blood corpuscle without the  vital force to set in motion and keep up the process of digestion and  assimilation. Without a God to endow the body with this vital force,  there would be none, and consequently no digestion and no animal heat or  physical force. If animal life and force result from organization and  chemical digestion, a chemist could make a dead body live, where the  organs are not destroyed, by putting food into the stomach and giving it  time to chemically digest, which it would do in a short time, but it  will neither produce animal heat nor support life. If digestion is a  chemical process, the chemist ought to be able to take bread and meat  and make a red blood corpuscle, which he can not do. Digestion and  assimilation are _vital_ processes. The vital force always eludes the  test of the chemist; but that force is always present in the living  animal economy. The chemist can purchase every ingredient that enters  into the composition of bone except the vital force, without which he  can not make an inch of bone. The making of bone is a vital process  which takes place only in the living animal economy. No physician can  possibly have a correct physiological theory of the cure of disease who  ignores the presence and power and office of the vital force in the  human system.    The body of man was formed of the dust of the ground according to Moses,  and no mistake; Mr. Ingersoll to the contrary notwithstanding. Moses  further says that the Lord God \"breathed into his nostrils the breath of  life, and man became a living soul.\" According to this author, life did  not result from organization. What the Almighty breathed into his  nostrils was not atmospheric air; for the air was in his nostrils before  Jehovah breathed the breath of life into them, and yet it did not make  this body live. Using the term breath in the sense of air that we  breathe, the old adage that \"men die for the want of breath\" is not  true; for the body dead is surrounded with the same air as when it was  living. When the Creator breathed the breath of life into the  newly-formed body, and man became a living soul, he imparted more to it  than simply air; and when the body dies, something more than simply air  or breath has departed from it. Solomon was wiser than the average wise  acre or the conceited materialistic doctor when he said concerning  death: \"Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the  spirit shall return unto God who gave it.\" \"The body without the spirit  is dead,\" says Inspiration. It is the presence of this spirit in the  human body, imparted to it by the Almighty, which vitalizes the body,  which produces the vital force, by which force the body is builded and  its operations carried on.    As the Creator formed the body of the first man of the dust of the  ground, and vitalized it by breathing into it the breath of life, and  endowed it with a living germ and vital force by which, under proper  circumstances, it reproduces itself; so God said: \"Let the earth bring  forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit  after his kind, _whose seed is in itself_, upon the earth.\" The seed has  in it a germ of life and a hidden vital force which heat, moisture and  the soil have the capacity of developing, so that it reproduces itself.  Every vital manifestation of this seed is the result of vital force with  which the Creator has endowed every perfect seed. This force in the  animal and vegetable kingdoms produces vital manifestations.    Chemical and other physical forces never produce vital manifestations.  \"Gravity is that species of force by which all bodies or particles of  matter in the universe tend toward each other.\" The reason why bodies  are drawn towards each other in this manner is because God has endowed  them with a force which compels them to act in this way. To call it the  force of gravity is no explanation of either the origin or nature of  this force. To say that gravity makes the apple fall down instead of up  is a polite way of expressing one's ignorance of such questions. To say  that nature makes a seed grow, that nature heals a wound, is only to  make a show of learning. God made the worlds and upholds them by the  power of his word. God energizes nature. All the physical and vital  forces of the universe are but the manifestation of his power. God has  endowed all things that grow with the germ of life. Atheistical  philosophy starts without God and ends without him. It seeks for  spontaneous generation, but never finds it. It would have a stream  without a fountain, and an effect without a cause, and a world without a  Creator. I have no use for any theory of life, or of medicine, which  denies the existence of God, whom I regard as the source of all the  forces in the universe. Nature is only the manifestation of his power  and wisdom. There is nothing supernatural in the universe unless it be  God himself. All the wonderful phenomena of the human body are the  result of a living force with which he has endowed it, and are to be  explained, if explained at all, by a better knowledge of the intentions  and workings of this force. This knowledge will be obtained by a more  careful study of nature, by a more intimate acquaintance with him and  his works. Anatomically, physiologically, and intellectually, \"man is  fearfully and wonderfully made\"; and every wonderful thing connected  with him is worthy of our careful consideration.    _Kokomo, Ind._          \"ALLEGED CONTRADICTIONS.\"    ANSWERED, PERHAPS THE THOUSANDTH TIME, BY REQUEST FROM LOGANSPORT.      \"Michal, the daughter of Saul, had no child unto the day of her  death.\"--Second Samuel, vi, 23. \"But the king took the five sons of  Michal, _whom she brought up for Adriel_, the son of Barzillai, the  Meholathite.\"--Second Samuel, xxi, 8. Dear friend, if you will notice  the last quotation closely you will find that the words which I have  italicised clearly indicate the true solution of the difficulty, which  has no real historic existence. Those sons _were not the natural sons_  of Michal, but adopted sons, which she brought up for Adriel, whose wife  was _Moreb_, the natural mother of those children. But, somehow, it  comes to pass that you refer me in both cases to the first book of  Samuel instead of the second. How is this?    _Second case._ \"And it came to pass after these things that God did  tempt Abraham.\" The contrary does not happen to be a contradiction. Here  it is, \"Let no man say when he is _tempted_ I _am tempted_ of God; for  God can not be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man with  evil.\"--James i, 13. Any grammarian can see at once that there is no  contradiction here. God did (try) tempt Abraham. When was this and what  was it for? Well, it was thousands of years before James's _present  tense_ language was written. Suppose I give a parallel. Here it is: Let  no Jew say when he offers a lamb he offers it to obey the Lord, for the  Lord accepteth not lambs, neither does he require them of any man. The  contradiction is found in the fact that some thousands of years in the  past, the Lord did, for wise and benevolent purposes, require Jews to  offer lambs. Now, can any man fail to see that there is no  contradiction here. God did tempt Abraham. What was it for? Answer. He  simply designed to teach Abraham, in a way that would impress the lesson  upon the mind for all time to come, that the human beings were not to be  offered in burnt sacrifices as the heathen were wont to do. His angel  said to Abraham, \"Stay thy hand.\" See! there is an offering fast by the  horns in the bushes. _Don't kill your son!_ Yes, God did try or tempt  Abraham. It was a grand trial of his loyalty to God. And it was God's  most effectual way of teaching Abraham and his posterity that they must  not offer their sons and daughters in the fire as the heathen did. There  is not only no contradiction here, but a grand lesson also, which  represents God in just the reverse of the infidel interpretation of the  case.    _Third case._ \"And the man which journeyed with him stood speechless,  _hearing a voice_, but seeing _no man_.\"--Acts iv, 7. This voice heard  by those persons was in the _Hebrew tongue_, and as such was _not  understood_ by those who were with Saul. So we have it upon record in  the 22d chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, that \"they saw _the light_  and were afraid, but they heard not,\" that is, _understood not_, the  voice. That the voice was in the Hebrew is asserted in the twenty-sixth  chapter and the fourteenth verse. We often hear a man's voice, and fail  at the same time--say we did not hear because we did not understand the  words uttered. Such is the latitude of the original term translated by  the word _hear_. So there is no contradiction here. The term _hear_ in  one passage is used with reference simply to the noise; in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28678"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#4)"],[1," the most powerful.  The Lord himself \"strove with the ancient Jews by his Spirit in his  prophets, and they would not hear but resisted the Spirit.\" Stephen,  after he had made one grand effort to instruct his hearers, said, \"Ye  stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist  the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did so do ye.\" Acts vii, 51. Was the  condition of those fellows unavoidable? If it was, they were not to  blame. But there was nothing in their condition that was not in their  power. If there was, why should we find these words in their law,  \"circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.\"  Deut. x, 16. The Lord has made the salvation of all men possible,  otherwise those remaining in an unconverted state, and dying in their  sins, are unavoidably lost. And who is to blame? The Father \"so loved  the world that he gave his only begotten son to die for every man. He  sent him to be the Savior of the world. The Gospel is the ministration  of the Spirit. The Apostles preached it with the Holy Spirit sent down  from heaven. They received grace and Apostleship, for the obedience of  faith among all nations, for Christ's name.\" Rom. i, 5. A great and  grand law governed them. In obeying it they did all that they ever did  for the world or for the church. There were just three duties prescribed  in that law. The first is in the word \"teach,\" or, the _better  rendering_, disciple. The second is in the word \"baptizing;\" and the  third is in the phrase \"teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I  have commanded you.\" The whole is beautifully rendered thus, \"Going  therefore, disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the  Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\" And the whole is rested  upon a declaration of kingly authority, viz: \"All power in heaven and  upon earth is given into my hands,\" going _therefore_,--you see the  connection.    Go to the Acts of the Apostles and read for yourselves and see how they  turned men to God. Paul says, \"That he showed first to them of Damascus,  and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then to  the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn, convert, to God, and do  works meet for repentance.\" Some disobeyed under the preaching and  teaching of the Apostles. Some under the teachings of Christ. And many  \"rejected the council of God against themselves in not being baptized of  John's baptism.\" Jesus said, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the  gospel to every creature; he that believeth and is baptized shall be  saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned.\" Paul was preaching at  Corinth; many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptized,  and Jesus appeared unto him in a vision by night, and said, \"Speak  boldly and hold not thy peace, and I will let no man set on thee to hurt  thee.\"    Christ gave the commission and Paul was carrying it out. The Savior's  visit to Corinth, in vision, was to encourage Paul to go on. Would all  the preachers in this country encourage such a work by speaking well of  it? Would they say, Go on? If I was preaching in a great city under the  same circumstances that surrounded Paul in Corinth, and the days of  miracles were not past, I might rationally conclude that Jesus would  encourage me in the same manner. Be that as it may, one thing is  doubtless true, viz., the same work is the Lord's work yet, and his  visit to Corinth to encourage Paul is a great source of encouragement to  us. The primitive Christians were all baptized believers; all converted  to the service of God; none of them on probation, but all in the  fellowship. All were \"sanctified unto obedience,\" all had \"purified  their souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit.\" Many reverse the  order thus: \"Get your souls purified and then obey the truth.\" But  Christ has become the \"Author of eternal salvation unto all those who  obey him.\" Heb. v, 9. Jesus said, \"Except a man be born of water and of  the Spirit, he can not enter into the kingdom of God.\" Whatever this  language may mean _it_ is accomplished when the sinner is begotten in  Christ Jesus through the gospel and baptized into Christ.    Paul said of the Corinthians: \"In Christ Jesus have I begotten you  through the Gospel.\" And they, \"Hearing, believed and were baptized.\"  And James said: \"Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth.\"  Consequently, the entire meaning is in the power of all sinners who have  access to the Gospel of Christ. Otherwise, the sinner is unavoidably  lost for his unavoidable unbelief. But we are told in John's Record, i,  12, \"That as many as received him to them gave he power to become the  sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.\" So the power of the  sinner to become a son of God depends upon his belief on the name of the  Son of God, and if he can not believe it is no fault of his. _Poor  fellow!_ Is he thus doomed? If he can believe on the name of Christ he  is able to reach the relation of a son. For the divine law grants the  privilege, liberty or power to as many as believe on the name of Christ.  The primitive Christians were the \"children of God by faith in Jesus  Christ, for as many as were baptized into Christ put on Christ.\" Gal.  iii, 26, 27. John said: \"Little children, let no man deceive you: he  that doth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.\" 1 John  iii, 7. \"If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that  doth righteousness is born of him.\" 1 John ii, 29. The great appeal to  man as a moral agent is in these words: \"Know ye not that to whom ye  _yield yourselves_ servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye  obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness.\"  Rom. vi, 16. Do you not know this? Do you not know that you will  receive, in the great day, according to that which you have done,  whether it be good or bad? Then why not obey the Gospel and enjoy its  promises?          OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO REVELATION--No. VI.    BY P.T. RUSSELL.      THE NATURE OF MAN NECESSITATED REVELATION.    The above proposition rests upon and is in harmony with all the  relations existing between natural wants and supplies, being itself a  supply. Does the power of vision make light a necessity? Yes; without it  the eye would be useless. Could man create his own light? It has taken  ages upon ages to invent the limited artificial light which we now have.  Man is endowed with the powers of locomotion. Could he create an earth  to move upon? Could he create the air for breathing? Were these and all  such matters necessities? And was man entirely unable to provide for his  own natural wants? The faculties with which man is endowed call for  these supplies, and they are necessities on account of the existence of  these faculties. Think of a being, if you can, with the powers of vision  in the entire absence of light, with no air to breathe nor earth to move  upon. Do you say such would be a grand failure? So it would. But the  Creator has not given powers to man for which he has no use, having  nothing to meet their demands. The existence of a faculty or power leads  logically to the conclusion which all candid, intelligent people have  reached, viz: that the Creator has made a supply for the use of every  faculty, or power which was designed and provided. Do you ask, what of  all this? I answer, man has the power to become religious, but he had no  more power to invent a supply for this faculty than he had to create  light for the eye or air to breathe. So the necessity for this must be  met with a supply from the Creator as well as all other natural demands  or powers.    Now, as we have a desire for the knowledge that we are approved of God,  and as religion consists in this knowledge, and in the knowledge of our  relations, dependence and obligations to God; and, as we have but one  means of obtaining this knowledge, and that is the means of his will  concerning us, then by knowing through that will that our actions are  such as he desires and approves, the one question remains to be  answered, How can man obtain the knowledge of the will of another  concerning himself? Ans.--Only by a revelation of the will of the one to  the other. I know not the will of the reader of this essay concerning  myself. My style of writing may not please him, but if he would tell me  just how he wishes me to write, then, by following his directions, I  should obtain the knowledge of his approbation as a necessary result  experienced in my own mental nature. This is plain, but no more plain  than God's revelation to man and its results experienced in conscious  knowledge.      AN IMPORTANT THOUGHT.    In order to man's highest happiness, all his powers must be so called  into activity by education that each faculty may act with energy, but at  the same time in exact harmony with all of its kindred powers. There  must be no clash, no jar nor friction. No one power must be highly  exercised and cultivated at the expense of the rest, but each must be  brought out by its own appropriate food. Material food is for the  body--it can not feed upon thought, nor mind upon bread. \"Man should not  live upon bread alone.\" This is an axiomatic truth endorsed by man's  two-fold nature. If you feed and exercise the body only you may acquire  the strength of an Ajax, but your countenance will be as stolid and your  eye as dull as the Hottentot's. Such a fellow would be of almost no use  whatever. Add to the education of the body the cultivation of the  intellect only; now the prospect is fearful, for the intellect always  works for its master, and in this case, the man being without moral and  religious training, the master Will be his animal desires. Can you  imagine the depth of infamy and pollution that is possible in this case?  The entire motive power that moves his intellect is carnal, sensual and  devilish. He now needs the sanction of a higher "]]]
