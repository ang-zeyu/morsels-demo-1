Except under the influence of desire, no one would  admit for a moment so crude a generalisation from such a tiny selection  of facts. What does result, not specially from biology, but from all the  sciences which deal with what exists, is that we cannot understand the  world unless we can understand change and continuity. This is even more  evident in physics than it is in biology. But the analysis of change and  continuity is not a problem upon which either physics or biology throws  any light: it is a problem of a new kind, belonging to a different kind  of study. The question whether evolutionism offers a true or a false  answer to this problem is not, therefore, a question to be solved by  appeals to particular facts, such as biology and physics reveal. In  assuming dogmatically a certain answer to this question, evolutionism  ceases to be scientific, yet it is only in touching on this question  that evolutionism reaches the subject-matter of philosophy. Evolutionism  thus consists of two parts: one not philosophical, but only a hasty  generalisation of the kind which the special sciences might hereafter  confirm or confute; the other not scientific, but a mere unsupported  dogma, belonging to philosophy by its subject-matter, but in no way  deducible from the facts upon which evolution relies.    (2) The predominant interest of evolutionism is in the question of human  destiny, or at least of the destiny of Life. It is more interested in  morality and happiness than in knowledge for its own sake. It must be  admitted that the same may be said of many other philosophies, and that  a desire for the kind of knowledge which philosophy really can give is  very rare. But if philosophy is to become scientific--and it is our  object to discover how this can be achieved--it is necessary first and  foremost that philosophers should acquire the disinterested intellectual  curiosity which characterises the genuine man of science. Knowledge  concerning the future--which is the kind of knowledge that must be  sought if we are to know about human destiny--is possible within certain  narrow limits. It is impossible to say how much the limits may be  enlarged with the progress of science. But what is evident is that any  proposition about the future belongs by its subject-matter to some  particular science, and is to be ascertained, if at all, by the methods  of that science. Philosophy is not a short cut to the same kind of  results as those of the other sciences: if it is to be a genuine study,  it must have a province of its own, and aim at results which the other  sciences can neither prove nor disprove.    The consideration that philosophy, if there is such a study, must  consist of propositions which could not occur in the other sciences, is  one which has very far-reaching consequences. All the questions which  have what is called a human interest--such, for example, as the question  of a future life--belong, at least in theory, to special sciences, and  are capable, at least in theory, of being decided by empirical evidence.  Philosophers have too often, in the past, permitted themselves to  pronounce on empirical questions, and found themselves, as a result, in  disastrous conflict with well-attested facts. We must, therefore,  renounce the hope that philosophy can promise satisfaction to our  mundane desires. What it can do, when it is purified from all practical  taint, is to help us to understand the general aspects of the world and  the logical analysis of familiar but complex things. Through this  achievement, by the suggestion of fruitful hypotheses, it may be  indirectly useful in other sciences, notably mathematics, physics, and  psychology. But a genuinely scientific philosophy cannot hope to appeal  to any except those who have the wish to understand, to escape from  intellectual bewilderment. It offers, in its own domain, the kind of  satisfaction which the other sciences offer. But it does not offer, or  attempt to offer, a solution of the problem of human destiny, or of the  destiny of the universe.    Evolutionism, if what has been said is true, is to be regarded as a  hasty generalisation from certain rather special facts, accompanied by a  dogmatic rejection of all attempts at analysis, and inspired by  interests which are practical rather than theoretical. In spite,  therefore, of its appeal to detailed results in various sciences, it  cannot be regarded as any more genuinely scientific than the classical  tradition which it has replaced. How philosophy is to be rendered  scientific, and what is the true subject-matter of philosophy, I shall  try to show first by examples of certain achieved results, and then more  generally. We will begin with the problem of the physical conceptions of  space and time and matter, which, as we have seen, are challenged by the  contentions of the evolutionists. That these conceptions stand in need  of reconstruction will be admitted, and is indeed increasingly urged by  physicists themselves. It will also be admitted that the reconstruction  must take more account of change and the universal flux than is done in  the older mechanics with its fundamental conception of an indestructible  matter. But I do not think the reconstruction required is on Bergsonian  lines, nor do I think that his rejection of logic can be anything but  harmful. I shall not, however, adopt the method of explicit controversy,  but rather the method of independent inquiry, starting from what, in a  pre-philosophic stage, appear to be facts, and keeping always as close  to these initial data as the requirements of consistency will permit.    Although explicit controversy is almost always fruitless in philosophy,  owing to the fact that no two philosophers ever understand one another,  yet it seems necessary to say something at the outset in justification  of the scientific as against the mystical attitude. Metaphysics, from  the first, has been developed by the union or the conflict of these two  attitudes. Among the earliest Greek philosophers, the Ionians were more  scientific and the Sicilians more mystical.[6] But among the latter,  Pythagoras, for example, was in himself a curious mixture of the two  tendencies: the scientific attitude led him to his proposition on  right-angled triangles, while his mystic insight showed him that it is  wicked to eat beans. Naturally enough, his followers divided into two  sects, the lovers of right-angled triangles and the abhorrers of beans;  but the former sect died out, leaving, however, a haunting flavour of  mysticism over much Greek mathematical speculation, and in particular  over Plato's views on mathematics. Plato, of course, embodies both the  scientific and the mystical attitudes in a higher form than his  predecessors, but the mystical attitude is distinctly the stronger of  the two, and secures ultimate victory whenever the conflict is sharp.  Plato, moreover, adopted from the Eleatics the device of using logic to  defeat common sense, and thus to leave the field clear for mysticism--a  device still employed in our own day by the adherents of the classical  tradition.      [6] _Cf._ Burnet, _Early Greek Philosophy_, pp. 85 ff.    The logic used in defence of mysticism seems to me faulty as logic, and  in a later lecture I shall criticise it on this ground. But the more  thorough-going mystics do not employ logic, which they despise: they  appeal instead directly to the immediate deliverance of their insight.  Now, although fully developed mysticism is rare in the West, some  tincture of it colours the thoughts of many people, particularly as  regards matters on which they have strong convictions not based on  evidence. In all who seek passionately for the fugitive and difficult  goods, the conviction is almost irresistible that there is in the world  something deeper, more significant, than the multiplicity of little  facts chronicled and classified by science. Behind the veil of these  mundane things, they feel, something quite different obscurely shimmers,  shining forth clearly in the great moments of illumination, which alone  give anything worthy to be called real knowledge of truth. To seek such  moments, therefore, is to them the way of wisdom, rather than, like the  man of science, to observe coolly, to analyse without emotion, and to  accept without question the equal reality of the trivial and the  important.    Of the reality or unreality of the mystic's world I know nothing. I have  no wish to deny it, nor even to declare that the insight which reveals  it is not a genuine insight. What I do wish to maintain--and it is here  that the scientific attitude becomes imperative--is that insight,  untested and unsupported, is an insufficient guarantee of truth, in  spite of the fact that much of the most important truth is first  suggested by its means. It is common to speak of an opposition between  instinct and reason; in the eighteenth century, the opposition was drawn  in favour of reason, but under the influence of Rousseau and the  romantic movement instinct was given the preference, first by those who  rebelled against artificial forms of government and thought, and then,  as the purely rationalistic defence of traditional theology became  increasingly difficult, by all who felt in science a menace to creeds  which they associated with a spiritual outlook on life and the world.  Bergson, under the name of \"intuition,\" has raised instinct to the  position of sole arbiter of metaphysical truth. But in fact the  opposition of instinct and reason is mainly illusory. Instinct,  intuition, or insight is what first leads to the beliefs which  subsequent reason confirms or confutes; but the confirmation, where it  is possible, consists, in the last analysis, of agreement with other  beliefs no less instinctive.

Such natural changes include spatial and temporal trends  or cycles in the physical (temperature, tides, currents, turbidity,  etc.), chemical (salinity, dissolved gases, inorganic/organic  substances--nutrients, etc.) or biological (primary productivity,  zooplankton, nekton, benthic species, predators, etc.) properties or  characteristics of the waters within and outside the Bay. Temporal  and/or spatial differences in relative abundance of three different  prey species within and outside the Bay may have occurred and been  responsible, at least in part, for the movement of humpbacks from  Glacier Bay. At this time, data are inadequate to relate the movement  of humpback whales from Glacier Bay in 1978 and 1979 to physical,  chemical, or biological factors. Meeting participants felt that  physical and chemical factors were unlikely to have changed  sufficiently between 1976 and 1978 to affect humpback whales, while  biological factors, perhaps as a result of physio-chemical changes,  could have changed sufficiently to have caused or contributed to the  movement.    Human activity may have caused changes in the physical, chemical, or  biological environment, effecting humpbacks directly or indirectly.  Human and vessel activities may have occurred such that the space  (vertical and/or horizontal) available to whales for normal activities  was less than that necessary (below some threshold level or value).  \"Too many\" vessels may have transited an area and/or approached whales  \"too closely\" for \"too long\" a period of time, producing visual,  acoustic, tactile, chemical, or other as yet unknown stimuli at levels  or values (magnitude, intensity, duration, frequency, interval, etc.)  greater than the whales would tolerate. The physical-acoustic  environment may have changed as a result of sounds produced by  vessels. Vessel sounds may be modified, amplified, intensified, etc.,  as a result of the geological/topographical features of Glacier Bay  (and perhaps Lynn Canal as well). Direct interference with the whales'  own sounds may have occurred or \"environmental\" sound levels may have  exceeded certain thresholds. Basic data on the acoustic properties and  characteristics of Glacier Bay with and in the absence of vessels are  lacking.    Changes in water quality may have occurred through pollution. Data are  insufficient to document the past or present levels of pollution, but  they were thought by meeting participants to be relatively low.    Changes in the biological environment induced by human activity may be  contributory to the movement of whales. Movement from Lynn Canal may  have resulted from direct competition for the same resource at the  same time, by depletion of the resource below levels sufficient to  support humpbacks or as a result of noise or the presence of fishing  vessels. Fishing activity or overharvesting (depletion of resource) of  other species at other trophic levels may indirectly impact humpbacks  through the food web/chains. There are insufficient data to prove or  disprove such hypotheses at this time.    In summary, a best interpretation of the available data is that  uncontrolled increase of vessel traffic, particularly of erratic  charter/pleasure craft, may have adversely altered the behavior of  humpback whales in Glacier Bay and thus may be implicated in their  departure from the Bay the past two years. The causal mechanism of  this adverse reaction to increased vessel traffic remains unknown. The  effects of increasing vessel traffic apparently are exacerbated by the  narrow physical confines of Glacier Bay. This analysis is not  clear-cut, however, and may be confounded, at least in 1979, by  possible shifts in the occurrence and availability of preferred prey  species of humpback whales.        [Footnote 5: This summary is based on information presented at        the meeting and resulting discussions.]          ADEQUACY OF EXISTING DATA      In the Background and Possible Cause and Effect sections it  was stated that insufficient data exist to indicate cause and effect  relationships. Data are not sufficient in many areas, e.g.:        1) environmental baseline data (biological, chemical, and         physical) are inadequate;        2) data available (i.e., Juraszs') have not been analyzed fully;        3) changes in human use of areas are not adequately quantified         (e.g., for fishing, cruising, touring, pleasure boating); and        4) data on the acoustic characteristics of Glacier Bay or the         vessels occurring in the Bay are not available.
