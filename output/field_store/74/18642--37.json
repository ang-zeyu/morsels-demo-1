[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34853"],[0,"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (#4)"],[1,"there are fiercer kinds of fairies and terrible  water-kelpies, and in the Western Hebrides there is the much-dreaded  'spirit-host' moving through the air at night.    The Naturalistic Theory shows accurately enough that natural phenomena  and environment have given direction to the anthropomorphosing of gods,  spirits, or fairies, but after explaining this external aspect of the  Fairy-Faith it cannot logically go any further. Or if illogically it  does attempt to explain the belief in gods, spirits, or fairies as due  entirely to material causes, it becomes, in our opinion, like the  psychology of fifty years ago, obsolete; for now the new psychology or  psychical research has been forced to admit--if only as a working  hypothesis--the possibility of invisible intelligences or entities able  to influence man and nature. We seem even to be approaching a scientific  proof of the doctrines of such ancient philosophical scientists as  Pythagoras and Plato,--that all external nature, animated throughout and  controlled in its phenomena by daemons acting by the will of gods, is to  men nothing more than the visible effects of an unseen world of causes.    In the internal aspects of the Fairy-Faith the fundamental fact seems  clearly to be that there must have been in the minds of prehistoric men,  as there is now in the minds of modern men, a germ idea of a fairy for  environment to act upon and shape. Without an object to act upon,  environment can accomplish nothing. This is evident. The Naturalistic  Theory examines only the environment and its effects, and forgets  altogether the germ idea of a fairy to be acted upon; but the  Psychological Theory remembers and attempts to explain the germ idea of  a fairy and the effect of nature upon it.    The second theory may be called the Pygmy Theory, which Mr. David  MacRitchie, who is definitely committed to it, has so clearly set forth  in his well-known work, entitled _The Testimony of Tradition_. This  theory is that the whole fairy-belief has grown up out of a folk-memory  of an actual Pygmy race. This race is supposed to have been a very  early, prehistoric, probably Mongolian race, which inhabited the British  Islands and many parts of Continental Europe. When the Celtic nations  appeared, these pygmies were driven into mountain fastnesses and into  the most inaccessible places, where a few of them may have survived  until comparatively historical times.    Over against the champions of the Pygmy Theory may be set two of its  opponents, Dr. Bertram C. A. Windle and Mr. Andrew Lang.[3] Dr. Windle,  in his Introduction to Tyson's _Philological Essay concerning the  Pygmies of the Ancients_, makes these six most destructive criticisms or  points against the theory: (1) So far as our present knowledge teaches  us, there never was a really Pygmy race inhabiting the northern parts of  Scotland; (2) the mounds with which the tales of little people are  associated have not, in many cases, been habitations, but were natural  or sepulchral in their nature; (3) little people are not by any means  associated entirely with mounds; (4) the association of giants and  dwarfs in traditions confuses the theory; (5) there are fairies where no  pygmies ever were, as, for example, in North America; (6) even Eskimos  and Lapps have fairy beliefs, and could not have been the original  fairies of more modern fairy-lore. Altogether, as we think our study  will show, the evidence of the Fairy-Faith itself gives only a slender  and superficial support to the Pygmy Theory. We maintain that the  theory, so far as it is provable, and this is evidently not very far, is  only one strand, contributed by ethnology and social psychology, in the  complex fabric of the Fairy-Faith, and is, as such, woven round a  psychical central pattern--the fundamental pattern of the Fairy-Faith.  Therefore, from our point of view, the Pygmy Theory is altogether  inadequate, because it overlooks or misinterprets the most essential and  prominent elements in the belief which the Celtic peoples hold  concerning fairies and Fairyland.    The Druid Theory to account for fairies is less widespread. It is that  the folk-memory of the Druids and their magical practices is alone  responsible for the Fairy-Faith. The first suggestion of this theory  seems to have been made by the Rev. Dr. Cririe, in his _Scottish  Scenery_, published in 1803.[4] Three years later, the Rev. Dr. Graham  published an identical hypothesis in his _Sketches Descriptive of  Picturesque Scenery on the Southern Confines of Perthshire_. Mr.  MacRitchie suggests, with all reason, that the two writers probably had  discussed together the theory, and hence both put it forth. Alfred  Maury, in _Les Fees du Moyen-Age_, published in 1843 at Paris, appears  to have made liberal use of Patrick Graham's suggestions in propounding  his theory that the _fees_ or fairy women of the Middle Ages are due to  a folk-memory of Druidesses. Maury seems to have forgotten that  throughout pagan Britain and Ireland, both much more important for the  study of fairies than Celtic Europe during the Middle Ages, Druids  rather than Druidesses had the chief influence on the people, and that  yet, despite this fact, Irish and Welsh mythology is full of stories  about fairy women coming from the Otherworld; nor is there any proof, or  even good ground for argument, that the Irish fairy women are a  folk-memory of Druidesses, for if there ever were Druidesses in Ireland  they played a subordinate and very insignificant role. As in the case of  the Pygmy Theory, we maintain that the Druid Theory, also, is  inadequate. It discovers a real anthropomorphic influence at work on the  outward aspects of the Fairy-Faith, and illogically takes that to be the  origin of the Fairy-Faith.    The fourth theory, the Mythological Theory, is of very great importance.  It is that fairies are the diminished figures of the old pagan  divinities of the early Celts; and many modern authorities on Celtic  mythology and folk-lore hold it. To us the theory is acceptable so far  as it goes. But it is not adequate in itself nor is it the root theory,  because a belief in gods and goddesses must in turn be explained; and in  making this explanation we arrive at the Psychological Theory, which  this study--perhaps the first one of its kind--attempts to set forth.      VII. THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING THE FAIRY-FAITH    I have made a very careful personal investigation of the surviving  Celtic Fairy-Faith by living for many months with and among the people  who preserve it; I have compared fairy phenomena and the phenomena said  to be caused by gods, genii, daemons, or spirits of different kinds and  recorded in the writings of ancient, mediaeval, and modern metaphysical  philosophers, Christian and pagan saints, mystics, and seers, and now  more or less clearly substantiated by from thirty to forty years of  experimentation in psychical sciences by eminent scientists of our own  times, such as Sir William Crookes and Sir Oliver Lodge in England, and  M. Camille Flammarion in France. As a result, I am convinced of the very  great value of a serious study of the Fairy-Faith. The Fairy-Faith as  the folk-religion of the Celts ought, like all religions, to be studied  sympathetically as well as scientifically. To those who take a  materialistic view of life, and consequently deny the existence of  spirits or invisible intelligences such as fairies are said to be, we  should say as my honoured American teacher in psychology, the late Dr.  William James, of Harvard, used to say in his lectures at Stanford  University, 'Materialism considered as a system of philosophy never tries  to explain the _Why_ of things.' But in our study of the Fairy-Faith we  shall attempt to deal with this _Why_ of things; and, then, perhaps the  value of studying fairies and Fairyland will be more apparent, even to  materialists.    The great majority of men in cities are apt to pride themselves on their  own exemption from 'superstition', and to smile pityingly at the poor  countrymen and countrywomen who believe in fairies. But when they do so  they forget that, with all their own admirable progress in material  invention, with all the far-reaching data of their acquired science,  with all the vast extent of their commercial and economic conquests,  they themselves have ceased to be natural. Wherever under modern  conditions great multitudes of men and women are herded together there  is bound to be an unhealthy psychical atmosphere never found in the  country--an atmosphere which inevitably tends to develop in the average  man who is not psychically strong enough to resist it, lower at the  expense of higher forces or qualities, and thus to inhibit any normal  attempts of the Subliminal Self (a well-accredited psychological entity)  to manifest itself in consciousness. In this connexion it is highly  significant to note that, as far as can be determined, almost all  professed materialists of the uncritical type, and even most of those  who are thinking and philosophizing sceptics about the existence of a  supersensuous realm or state of conscious being, are or have been  city-dwellers--usually so by birth and breeding. And even where we find  materialists of either type dwelling in the country, we generally find  them so completely under the hypnotic sway of city influences and mould  of thought in matters of education and culture, and in matters touching  religion, that they have lost all sympathetic and responsive contact  with Nature, because unconsciously they have thus permitted  conventionality and unnaturalness to insulate them from it. The Celtic  peasant, who may be their tenant or neighbour, is--if still uncorrupted  by them--in direct contrast unconventional and natural. He is normally  always responsive to psychical influences--as much so as an Australian  Arunta or an American Red Man, who also, like him, are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34856"],[0,"My Own Story (#4)"],[1,".) Neither of these organisations have woman suffrage  for their object. They came into existence to uphold party ideas and to  work for the election of party candidates.    I am told that women in America have recently allied themselves with  political parties, believing, just as we did, that such action would  break down opposition to suffrage by showing the men that women possess  political ability, and that politics is work for women as well as men.  Let them not be deceived. I can assure the American women that our long  alliance with the great parties, our devotion to party programmes, our  faithful work at elections, never advanced the suffrage cause one step.  The men accepted the services of the women, but they never offered any  kind of payment.    As far as I am concerned, I did not delude myself with any false hopes  in the matter. I was present when the Women's Liberal Federation came  into existence. Mrs. Gladstone presided, offering the meeting many  consolatory words for the absence of \"our great leader,\" Mr. Gladstone,  who of course had no time to waste on a gathering of women. At Mrs.  Jacob Bright's request I joined the Federation. At this stage of my  development I was a member of the Fabian Society, and I had considerable  faith in the permeating powers of its mild socialism. But I was already  fairly convinced of the futility of trusting to political parties. Even  as a child I had begun to wonder at the _naive_ faith of party members  in the promises of their leaders. I well remember my father returning  home from political meetings, his face aglow with enthusiasm. \"What  happened, father?\" I would ask, and he would reply triumphantly, \"Ah! We  passed the resolution.\"    \"Then you'll get your measure through the next session,\" I predicted.    \"I won't say that,\" was the usual reply. \"Things don't always move as  quickly as that. But we passed the resolution.\"    Well, the suffragists, when they were admitted into the Women's Liberal  Federation must have felt that they had passed their resolution. They  settled down to work for the party and to prove that they were as  capable of voting as the recently enfranchised farm labourers. Of course  a few women remained loyal to suffrage. They began again on the old  educational lines to work for the cause. Not one woman took counsel with  herself as to how and why the agricultural labourers had won their  franchise. They had won it, as a matter of fact, by burning hay-ricks,  rioting, and otherwise demonstrating their strength in the only way that  English politicians can understand. The threat to march a hundred  thousand men to the House of Commons unless the bill was passed played  its part also in securing the agricultural labourer his political  freedom. But no woman suffragist noticed that. As for myself, I was too  young politically to learn the lesson then. I had to go through years of  public work before I acquired the experience and the wisdom to know how  to wring concessions from the English Government. I had to hold public  office. I had to go behind the scenes in the government schools, in the  workhouses and other charitable institutions; I had to get a close-hand  view of the misery and unhappiness of a man-made world, before I reached  the point where I could successfully revolt against it. It was almost  immediately after the collapse of the woman suffrage movement in 1884  that I entered upon this new phase of my career.          CHAPTER II      In 1885, a year after the failure of the third women's suffrage bill, my  husband, Dr. Pankhurst, stood as the Liberal candidate for Parliament in  Rotherline, a riverside constituency of London. I went through the  campaign with him, speaking and canvassing to the best of my ability.  Dr. Pankhurst was a popular candidate, and unquestionably would have  been returned but for the opposition of the Home-Rulers. Parnell was in  command, and his settled policy was opposition to all Government  candidates. So, in spite of the fact that Dr. Pankhurst was a staunch  upholder of home rule, the Parnell forces were solidly opposed to him,  and he was defeated. I remember expressing considerable indignation, but  my husband pointed out to me that Parnell's policy was absolutely right.  With his small party he could never hope to win home rule from a hostile  majority, but by constant obstruction he could in time wear out the  Government, and force it to surrender. That was a valuable political  lesson, one that years later I was destined to put into practice.    The following year found us living in London, and, as usual, interesting  ourselves with labour matters and other social movements. This year was  memorable for a great strike of women working in the Bryant and May  match factories. I threw myself into this strike with enthusiasm,  working with the girls and with some women of prominence, among these  the celebrated Mrs. Annie Besant. The strike was a successful one, the  girls winning substantial improvements in their working conditions.    It was a time of tremendous unrest, of labour agitations, of strikes and  lockouts. It was a time also when a most stupid reactionary spirit  seemed to take possession of the Government and the authorities. The  Salvation Army, the Socialists, the trade-unionists--in fact, all bodies  holding outdoor meetings--were made special objects of attack. As a  protest against this policy a Law and Liberty League was formed in  London, and an immense Free Speech meeting was held in Trafalgar Square,  John Burns and Cunningham Graham being the principal speakers. I was  present at this meeting, which resulted in a bloody riot between the  police and the populace. The Trafalgar Square Riot is historic, and to  it Mr. John Burns owes, in large part, his subsequent rise to political  eminence. Both John Burns and Cunningham Graham served prison sentences  for the part they played in the riot, but they gained fame, and they did  much to establish the right of free speech for English men. English  women are still contending for that right.    In 1890 my last child was born in London. I now had a family of five  young children, and for a time I was less active in public work. On the  retirement of Mrs. Annie Besant from the London School Board I had been  asked to stand as candidate for the vacancy, but although I should have  enjoyed the work, I decided not to accept this invitation. The next  year, however, a new suffrage association, the Women's Franchise League,  was formed, and I felt it my duty to become affiliated with it The  League was preparing a new suffrage bill, the provisions of which I  could not possibly approve, and I joined with old friends, among whom  were Mrs. Jacob Bright, Mrs. Wolstentholm-Elmy, who was a member of the  London School Board, and Mrs. Stanton Blatch, then resident in England,  in an effort to substitute the original bill drafted by Dr. Pankhurst.  As a matter of fact, neither of the bills was introduced into Parliament  that year. Mr. (now Lord) Haldane, who had the measure in charge,  introduced one of his own drafting. It was a truly startling bill,  royally inclusive in its terms. It not only enfranchised all women,  married and unmarried, of the householding classes, but it made them  eligible to all offices under the Crown. The bill was never taken  seriously by the Government, and indeed it was never intended that it  should be, as we were later made to understand. I remember going with  Mrs. Stanton Blatch to the law courts to see Mr. Haldane, and to protest  against the introduction of a measure that had not the remotest chance  of passing.    \"All, that bill,\" said Haldane, \"is for the future.\"    All their woman suffrage bills are intended for the future, a future so  remote as to be imperceptible. We were beginning to understand this even  in 1891. However, as long as there was a bill, we determined to support  it. Accordingly, we canvassed the members, distributed a great deal of  literature, and organised and addressed meetings. We not only made  speeches ourselves, but we induced friendly members of Parliament to go  on our platforms. One of these meetings, held in an East End Radical  club, was addressed by Mr. Haldane and a young man who accompanied him.  This young man, Sir Edward Grey, then in the beginning of his career,  made an eloquent plea for woman's suffrage. That Sir Edward Grey should,  later in life, become a bitter foe of woman's suffrage need astonish no  one. I have known many young Englishmen who began their political life  as suffrage speakers and who later became anti-suffragists or traitorous  \"friends\" of the cause. These young and aspiring statesmen have to  attract attention in some fashion, and the espousal of advanced causes,  such as labour or women's suffrage, seems an easy way to accomplish that  end.    Well, our speeches and our agitation did nothing at all to assist Mr.  Haldane's impossible bill. It never advanced beyond the first reading.    Our London residence came to an end in 1893. In that year we returned to  our Manchester home, and I again took up the work of the Suffrage  Society. At my suggestion the members began to organise their first  out-of-door meetings, and we continued these until we succeeded in  working up a great meeting that filled Free Trade Hall, and overflowed  into and crowded a smaller hall near at hand. This marked the beginning  of a campaign of propaganda among working people, an object which I had  long desired to bring about.    And now began a new and, as I look back on it, an absorbingly  interesting stage of my career. I have told how our leaders in the  Liberal Party had advised the women to prove their fitness for the  Parliamentary franchise by serving in municipal offices, especially the  unsalaried offices. A large number of women had availed themselves of  this advice, and were serving on Boards of Guardians, on school boards,  and in"]]]
