Two additional distinguishing characters, which we found difficult to  evaluate, are the nearly straight, dorsolateral folds, and lack of vocal  sacs or ostia in males of _R. a. coreana_ (Shannon, 1956:38). Some of  the differences between the two species were illustrated by Okada,  1931:107, fig. 48, _R. temporaria temporaria_ [=_R. t. dybowskii_] and  123, fig. 54, _R. temporaria coreana_ [=_R. amurensis coreana_].      =Rana temporaria dybowskii= G[:u]nther        _Rana Dybowskii_ G[:u]nther, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 4, 17:387, May,        1876 (type locality, Abrek Bay, near Vladivostok, Siberia).        _Rana temporaria dybowski_, Shannon, Herpetologica, 12:38, March 6,        1956.        _Specimens examined_ (20).--Central National Forest, near      Pup'yong-ni, 7 (KU); Chip'o-ri, 2 (KU); 1 mi. SW Inje, 6 (KU); 8 mi.      SW Kangnung, 1 (KU); Taegwang-ni, 1 (KU); 1 mi. SW Tangjonggok, 3      (KU).    _Remarks._--On October 9 in the Central National Forest, five  individuals were found in a concrete-walled pit in old ruins on a wooded  hillside; no specimens of _Rana amurensis coreana_ were taken there. _R.  t. dybowskii_ was most often taken on high, moist slopes, and seemed to  be especially common in forests. The specimen from 8 mi. SW Kangnung was  obtained in a wooded area along a mountain stream. The earliest date of  collection of a specimen of _dybowskii_ was March 7 at Taegwang-ni. See  also the remarks under the preceding account of _Rana amurensis  coreana_.    The largest male among our specimens measured 65 in snout-vent length  and the largest female, 79. Five gravid females had snout-vent lengths  of 64, 68, 69, 69 and 70.      =Trionyx sinensis= Wiegmann        _Trionyx (Aspidonectes) sinensis_ Wiegmann, Nova Acta Acad.        Leopold.-Carol., 17:189, 1835 (type locality, near Macao, China).        _Specimen examined._--Han River, 5 mi. ESE Seoul, 1 (KU).    _Remarks._--Our only specimen was purchased from a man who had captured  it by hand in the Han River; it was the only turtle seen during our stay  in Korea. Koreans eat turtles, and the elaborate (and relatively  permanent) fish-traps that they construct across streams and small  rivers probably reduce the size of populations of _T. sinensis_ and  other species.      =Eremias argus= Peters        _Eremias argus_ Peters, Monatsber. preuss. Akad. Wiss., Berlin, p.        61, fig. 3 (for 1869), 1870 (type locality, Chefoo, China).        _Specimens examined_ (23).--Chip'o-ri, 1 (KU); 5 mi. E Seoul, 3      (KU), 3 (UMMZ); 5 mi. ESE Seoul, 4 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 10 (UMMZ); 7      mi. ESE Seoul, 2 (KU).    _Remarks._--Individuals of _E. argus_ were most often seen on dry  hillsides having a relatively sparse cover of vegetation. The first  lizard of this species was taken on April 2. In 1954 the last part of  March and early part of April were generally warm, with temperatures  above 70deg. F. on several occasions; probably some _E. argus_ were active  in late March. KU 38773 (snout-vent length, 51) laid three eggs between  June 4 and 14; KU 38768 (snout-vent length, 58) obtained on May 8 was  gravid, containing four eggs. Testes of lizards in the breeding season  measure approximately 4.0 x 2.5 (KU 38772, obtained on June 16).    The snout-vent length of our largest female is 61, that of the largest  male, 57. The snout-vent length of 11 specimens averaged 77 (67-96) per  cent of length of tail.      =Tachydromus amurensis= Peters        _Tachydromus amurensis_ Peters, Sitzungsber. Gesell. naturf. Freunde        Berlin, p. 71, 1881 (type locality, Kossakewitcha, Amurland).        _Specimens examined_ (3).--Central National Forest, near      Pup'yong-ni, 1 (KU), 1 (UMMZ); Majon-ni, 1 (KU).    _Remarks._--One of our specimens was found among grasses along a small  stream in the Central National Forest. The other two were obtained by  other persons and we lack knowledge of conditions of their capture.    A juvenile (KU 39416, snout-vent length, 25) that was obtained on  September 9 is tentatively referred to this species. There seem to be  three femoral pores on the left leg but the number is indistinct on the  right. The specimen is dark and lacks a pattern. Its condition precludes  counts of ventral scales (not keeled), but scalation is otherwise the  same as a male (KU 40120, snout-vent length approximately 47, length of  tail, 124). The third specimen, a male (UMMZ 113442, snout-vent length,  51, length of tail, 115), agrees with KU 40120, except in having 32  instead of 29 dorsal scales at midbody, 4-4 instead of 3-3 femoral  pores, and in lacking a pale stripe from eye through ear to shoulder.      =Tachydromus wolteri= Fischer        _Tachydromus Wolteri_ Fischer, Jahrb. Wiss. Anst. Hamburg, 2:82 (for        1884), 1885 (type locality, Chemulp'o, Korea).        _Specimens examined_ (2).--Yongp'yong, 2 (KU).    _Remarks._--On April 14, two females (57 and 45 in snout-vent length,  the tail of the latter measuring 103) were easily captured by hand on a  burned-over rice field.      =Lygosoma reevesii= (Gray)        _Tiliqua Reevesii_ Gray, Ann. [Mag.] Nat. Hist., ser. 1, 2:292,        December, 1838 (type locality, China).        [_Lygosoma (Liolepisma) laterale_] var. _reevesi_, Boettger, Katalog        der Batrachier-Sammlung ..., p. 104, 1893.        _Specimens examined_ (6).--Central National Forest, near      Pup'yong-ni, 3 (KU); 4 mi. NNE Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 1 (KU); 7 mi. NNE      Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 1 (UMMZ); 16 mi. NE Mosulp'o, Cheju Do, 1      (UMMZ).    _Remarks._--On October 23 an individual was captured while sunning on a  stump on a wooded hillside in the Central National Forest; two others at  this locality were collected on damp ground-cover on the same hillside.  A juvenile from Cheju Do was found among moss-covered rocks in a stream  bed; the other specimens from Cheju Do were found among moss-covered  rocks on the western slope of Halla San.    Each ovary of a female obtained on October 23 contained five enlarged  follicles, about 1 mm. in diameter. The left testis of a male obtained  on August 10 seemed enlarged, indicating possible sexual activity, and  measured approximately 6 x 2 mm. The snout-vent length of our largest  male is 41, that of our largest female, 48. The prefrontals are in  contact in all of our specimens save one (UMMZ 113446).    There is disagreement among herpetologists concerning the generic name  of the small lygosome skink in the United States and its ecological  equivalent in China and Korea. We tentatively use _Lygosoma_ (Conant,  1951:207-208), although Mittleman (1950) pointed out reasons for using  _Scincella_. Shannon (1956:41) discussed the debated issue whether or  not the lygosome skinks of the New and Old worlds are conspecific.      =Rhabdophis tigrina lateralis= (Berthold)        _Tropidonotus lateralis_ Berthold, Nachrichten Gesell. Wiss.        G[:o]ttingen, p. 180, 1859 (type locality, China).        _Specimens examined_ (26).--Central National Forest, near      Pup'yong-ni, 1 (KU); 2 mi. N Chip'o-ri, 2 (KU); 3 mi. NW Chip'o-ri,      4 (KU); 4 mi. N Ch'onan, 1 (KU); 3 mi. S Kumhwa, 1 (KU); 1 mi. SW      Naegong-ni, 1 (KU); 4 mi. E Seoul, 1 (KU); 5 mi. E Seoul, 2 (UMMZ);      5 mi. ESE Seoul, 4 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 1 (KU), 4 (UMMZ); 7 mi. ESE      Seoul, 1 (KU); 6 mi. NNE Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 2 (KU); 5 mi. NE      Taejon, 1 (KU).    _Remarks._--This common, vagrant species was found on brushy hillsides,  near buildings on hills above rice fields, in tall grasses near streams,  in rice fields, and along drainage and irrigation ditches. The earliest  and latest dates of collection were April 5 and November 7. On the first  date mentioned an individual was found in hibernation with five _Elaphe  rufodorsata_ and one _Agkistrodon halys_ in an earthen Korean burial  mound. The specimen was uncovered by a bulldozer at a depth of about one  foot below the surface. We were told that 18 snakes of this species were  found in the same place (7 mi. ESE Seoul) the previous winter.    The stomach of each of four individuals contained one _Rana  nigromaculata_. The stomach of another individual contained a _R.  nigromaculata_ and remains of a carabid beetle, whereas another  contained three small, partially-digested frogs that appeared to be  _Hyla arborea_. P. M. Youngman reported to us that he found a snake of  this species that was attempting to swallow a toad, _Bufo bufo  gargarizans_. One of the small individuals from Cheju Do was being eaten  by a _Zamenis spinalis_ when found. One specimen was parasitized by  three nematodes, _Kalicephalus natricis_ (see Olsen, 1957:208).    Two females of this oviparous species (lengths of body, 680 and 700)  collected on May 14 contained nine eggs (18 mm. long), and 13 eggs (15  mm.) respectively; a third (length of body, 610) obtained on June 26  contained 10 eggs that were approximately 18 mm. long. A female (UMMZ  113458, length of body, 710), which was captured on July 10 and kept  alive in captivity, laid 11 eggs on August 12 between 9 and 10 in the  morning. The weight of nine of these eggs averaged 3.32 (3.0-3.6) grams;  the last two eggs deposited were small and weighed only 1.3 and 1.4  grams. The eggs were incubated unsuccessfully. One that was opened on  September 14 and another opened on September 26 contained young easily  recognized as of this species. In captivity the parent snake underwent  ecdysis on about July 20 and again on August 26.    Our largest female and largest male have respective total lengths of  1013 (840 + 173) and 740 (575 + 165).

PLANT LICE AND SCALE BUGS      Plant Lice (Aphids)          _Materials._    Plant lice on various kinds of plants, such as house plants, golden  glow, and other plants from the garden or field. Garden asters with  root lice (the asters should be transplanted into pots).          _Observations._    1. Describe the size, appearance, and colors of the plant lice in  your collection and their relation to the host plant.    2. Are the lice active or sluggish? (Compare with a house fly, for  instance.) What proportion of them have wings? What is the usual  method of locomotion?    3. Examining a single winged specimen, how many wings do you find?  How do they fold? What is the character of the wings?    4. What is the food of the plant lice? How is the food obtained?  (With a hand lens identify the piercing organ.) On what parts of the  plants are they found? Does the plant show any indication of being  harmed by the lice? If so, how?    5. Make a count of the plant lice upon a portion of a plant and  estimate the whole number upon a plant. Why are plant lice a very  serious pest?    6. If any plant lice have ants associated with them, study the  behavior of the ants in this curious relationship. What advantages  result from this relationship of ant and aphis to either or both  insects?      Scale Bugs          _Materials._    Twigs of trees, leaves, fruit, ferns, etc., infested with these bugs.  If possible, have samples of San Jose scales, maple scales, and  oyster scales.          _Observations._    1. What is the general size and appearance of the various scale bugs  in your collection? How do they differ in form and size and color?    2. Remove a scale and study it carefully with a lens. What is under  the scale? Of what is the scale composed? What do you discover about  these bugs to indicate that they are really insects?    3. What can be said about the number of scale bugs? Why are they  difficult to exterminate? How can they be distributed from one place  to another, as from orchard to orchard, since only the males have  wings?          _Drawings suggested._    a. A single aphis as seen with hand lens.    b. Various scale bugs as seen with a hand lens.    c. Twigs showing the distribution and numbers of scale bugs.      WATER BUGS AND BEETLES      Water Bugs          _Materials._    Water bugs and beetles of several species in small aquaria covered  with a wire net.          _Observations._    1. With what legs does the bug swim? Describe their appearance and  tell how used and how fitted for this use. Which legs are not used in  swimming?    2. Remove the bug from the water for a moment to test other methods  of locomotion, as jumping, crawling, flying. What do you discover?    3. Watch the bug as it gets a fresh supply of air, and describe the  process. Where is the air stored for use when under water? Does the  bug sink or rise when it stops swimming? Why?    4. Identify the bug's mouth parts. What is their appearance and  probable manner of use? How are the forelegs fitted for grasping  food?    5. What is the shape of the body? What is the position of the wings?  Do the two cover (fore) wings meet in a straight line or do they  cross at their tips? Are they smooth throughout and sheath-like, or  are they thick at the base and thin at the tips?          _Summary._    Summarize your study of the bug by enumerating the various ways the  bug is adapted for life in the water.      Water Beetles      Use the same questions for the study of water beetles as for water  bugs. In addition answer the following:--    1. Identify the eyes of the whirligig beetle and note their peculiar  construction. How can you explain this peculiar form of the eyes on  the basis of use? Why are the antennae of both water bugs and beetles  so small?          _Suggested drawings._    a. The dorsal view of both bug and beetle.    b. Ventral view of the bug's head to show the beak and first pair of  legs.      GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE LIBRARY          _Directions._    The books in a zoological library may be roughly divided into three  groups:--      1. Reference books.      a. Advanced textbooks.      b. Elementary textbooks.      c. Natural histories.      d. Books for classifying or naming animals.    2. Descriptive books.      e.

CHAPTER II    STUDIES OF INSECTS    _The effect of great numbers upon the structure and habits of  animals. The use of keys in finding the names of animals._      1. FIELD STUDIES          _Materials._    1. _Boxes_ for carrying insects. 2. A _net_. This may be homemade,  using mosquito netting or fish net and a stout wire. If it is to be  used for a dragnet for water insects, the wire must be stout and the  netting strong. Make the net twice as long as wide. 3. A _cyanide  jar_ for killing insects. 4. A few _paper triangles_ for carrying  butterflies. 5. A _notebook_.      _Note._--Your instructor will give directions for obtaining the    material called for in 3, 4, and 5.          _Directions._    Look carefully and quietly in the various situations noted below. Do  not be in a hurry. Weedy meadows or vacant lots and neglected  roadsides are good places for your first trips. Note concerning each  insect found: (a) its name or something by which to identify it, (b)  where you found it, (c) what it was doing, (d) its probable food.  Record these observations in your notebook. Make a special study of  such insects as your instructor may designate.      Where to look for Various Insects      _Grasshoppers, locusts, katydids._ Look along roadsides, waste  places, gardens, especially weedy ones, weedy lots, and grassy  meadows and pastures.    _Crickets._ Under old boards, along the edges of board or stone  walks, along fences.    _Beetles._ Same locations as for crickets, and also on flowering  plants, under loose bark of trees and stumps, in rotten logs, etc.  For _water beetles_ drag edges of ponds and streams.    _Dragon flies._ Along water-courses, ponds, and swamps. Drag ponds  and ditches for larvae.    _Bees._ On flowering plants, especially on large patches of wild  asters, golden-rods, and thistles.    _Wasps._ Sandy stretches,--especially along the water,--among  flowering plants, under the eaves and roofs of outbuildings. Nests  may be found in these latter places.    _Butterflies and moths._ In fields where there are many flowering  plants; look carefully on the leaves of plants for caterpillars, and  for eggs. Also look very carefully on the under side of leaves, on  twigs, and on the bark of trees for chrysalids of butterflies and  cocoons of moths.    _Bugs._ In same locations as for bees and grasshoppers and water  beetles. Also on fruit.    _Aphids._ On the fresh growing tops of plants.    _Tree hoppers._ On trees and shrubs. Hold your net on the under side  of branches and shake the branch vigorously.    _Flies._ Around decaying substances, as garbage, fruit, etc.; on  flowering plants.    _Ants._ Sandy waste places, decayed logs, along walks, often in  kitchens.      _Note._--At night many kinds of insects fly around electric    lights or into open windows, attracted by the light and may    easily be collected.      Form for Field Trip Report      The notes taken on a field trip may be conveniently tabulated for  permanent record in the form indicated below:--                        FIELD TRIP REPORT      Date________ Time________ Locality________ Pupil's Name________    ----------------------------------------------------------------    Name of Insect | Where Found | What it was Doing | Probable Food    ---------------+-------------+-------------------+--------------                   |             |                   |                   |             |                   |    In case the name of the insect is not known to you, use a number and  some designation as to color or other mark by which it may be known  until you have leisure to look up its name by means of keys or books  on insects.      Special Field Studies      The questions below may be used for a more careful field study of any  insect.    1. Just where was the insect found?    2. Note carefully what the insects are doing before they are  disturbed by your presence. What did the insects do when you  disturbed them? If you think this related to securing safety, explain  what leads you to think so.    3. What senses do you conclude are well developed? Reason for your  conclusion.    4. Has the insect a home? If so, what is its character?    5. What is the color? What is the relation between the color of the  insect and its surroundings?    6. Is the insect solitary in its habits or associated with others of  the same species? If in association with others, note the numbers,"]]]
