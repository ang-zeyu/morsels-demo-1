By degrees, this  new demand for elective and temporary rulers became the prominent object  of the exertions of the popular party, wherever any such party existed;  and superseded, to a considerable extent, the previous efforts to limit  the power of rulers. As the struggle proceeded for making the ruling  power emanate from the periodical choice of the ruled, some persons  began to think that too much importance had been attached to the  limitation of the power itself. _That_ (it might seem) was a resource  against rulers whose interests were habitually opposed to those of the  people. What was now wanted was, that the rulers should be identified  with the people; that their interest and will should be the interest and  will of the nation. The nation did not need to be protected against its  own will. There was no fear of its tyrannising over itself. Let the  rulers be effectually responsible to it, promptly removable by it, and  it could afford to trust them with power of which it could itself  dictate the use to be made. Their power was but the nation's own power,  concentrated, and in a form convenient for exercise. This mode of  thought, or rather perhaps of feeling, was common among the last  generation of European liberalism, in the Continental section of which  it still apparently predominates. Those who admit any limit to what a  government may do, except in the case of such governments as they think  ought not to exist, stand out as brilliant exceptions among the  political thinkers of the Continent. A similar tone of sentiment might  by this time have been prevalent in our own country, if the  circumstances which for a time encouraged it, had continued unaltered.    But, in political and philosophical theories, as well as in persons,  success discloses faults and infirmities which failure might have  concealed from observation. The notion, that the people have no need to  limit their power over themselves, might seem axiomatic, when popular  government was a thing only dreamed about, or read of as having existed  at some distant period of the past. Neither was that notion necessarily  disturbed by such temporary aberrations as those of the French  Revolution, the worst of which were the work of a usurping few, and  which, in any case, belonged, not to the permanent working of popular  institutions, but to a sudden and convulsive outbreak against  monarchical and aristocratic despotism. In time, however, a democratic  republic came to occupy a large portion of the earth's surface, and made  itself felt as one of the most powerful members of the community of  nations; and elective and responsible government became subject to the  observations and criticisms which wait upon a great existing fact. It  was now perceived that such phrases as \"self-government,\" and \"the power  of the people over themselves,\" do not express the true state of the  case. The \"people\" who exercise the power are not always the same people  with those over whom it is exercised; and the \"self-government\" spoken  of is not the government of each by himself, but of each by all the  rest. The will of the people, moreover, practically means, the will of  the most numerous or the most active _part_ of the people; the majority,  or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority: the  people, consequently, _may_ desire to oppress a part of their number;  and precautions are as much needed against this, as against any other  abuse of power. The limitation, therefore, of the power of government  over individuals, loses none of its importance when the holders of power  are regularly accountable to the community, that is, to the strongest  party therein. This view of things, recommending itself equally to the  intelligence of thinkers and to the inclination of those important  classes in European society to whose real or supposed interests  democracy is adverse, has had no difficulty in establishing itself; and  in political speculations \"the tyranny of the majority\" is now generally  included among the evils against which society requires to be on its  guard.    Like other tyrannies, the tyranny of the majority was at first, and is  still vulgarly, held in dread, chiefly as operating through the acts of  the public authorities. But reflecting persons perceived that when  society is itself the tyrant--society collectively, over the separate  individuals who compose it--its means of tyrannising are not restricted  to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries.  Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong  mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which  it ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable  than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually  upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape,  penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the  soul itself. Protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the  magistrate is not enough: there needs protection also against the  tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling; against the tendency of  society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas  and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them; to  fetter the development, and, if possible, prevent the formation, of any  individuality not in harmony with its ways, and compel all characters to  fashion themselves upon the model of its own. There is a limit to the  legitimate interference of collective opinion with individual  independence: and to find that limit, and maintain it against  encroachment, is as indispensable to a good condition of human affairs,  as protection against political despotism.    But though this proposition is not likely to be contested in general  terms, the practical question, where to place the limit--how to make the  fitting adjustment between individual independence and social  control--is a subject on which nearly everything remains to be done. All  that makes existence valuable to any one, depends on the enforcement of  restraints upon the actions of other people. Some rules of conduct,  therefore, must be imposed, by law in the first place, and by opinion on  many things which are not fit subjects for the operation of law. What  these rules should be, is the principal question in human affairs; but  if we except a few of the most obvious cases, it is one of those which  least progress has been made in resolving. No two ages, and scarcely any  two countries, have decided it alike; and the decision of one age or  country is a wonder to another. Yet the people of any given age and  country no more suspect any difficulty in it, than if it were a subject  on which mankind had always been agreed. The rules which obtain among  themselves appear to them self-evident and self-justifying. This all but  universal illusion is one of the examples of the magical influence of  custom, which is not only, as the proverb says, a second nature, but is  continually mistaken for the first. The effect of custom, in preventing  any misgiving respecting the rules of conduct which mankind impose on  one another, is all the more complete because the subject is one on  which it is not generally considered necessary that reasons should be  given, either by one person to others, or by each to himself. People are  accustomed to believe, and have been encouraged in the belief by some  who aspire to the character of philosophers, that their feelings, on  subjects of this nature, are better than reasons, and render reasons  unnecessary. The practical principle which guides them to their opinions  on the regulation of human conduct, is the feeling in each person's mind  that everybody should be required to act as he, and those with whom he  sympathises, would like them to act. No one, indeed, acknowledges to  himself that his standard of judgment is his own liking; but an opinion  on a point of conduct, not supported by reasons, can only count as one  person's preference; and if the reasons, when given, are a mere appeal  to a similar preference felt by other people, it is still only many  people's liking instead of one. To an ordinary man, however, his own  preference, thus supported, is not only a perfectly satisfactory  reason, but the only one he generally has for any of his notions of  morality, taste, or propriety, which are not expressly written in his  religious creed; and his chief guide in the interpretation even of that.  Men's opinions, accordingly, on what is laudable or blamable, are  affected by all the multifarious causes which influence their wishes in  regard to the conduct of others, and which are as numerous as those  which determine their wishes on any other subject. Sometimes their  reason--at other times their prejudices or superstitions: often their  social affections, not seldom their anti-social ones, their envy or  jealousy, their arrogance or contemptuousness: but most commonly, their  desires or fears for themselves--their legitimate or illegitimate  self-interest. Wherever there is an ascendant class, a large portion of  the morality of the country emanates from its class interests, and its  feelings of class superiority. The morality between Spartans and Helots,  between planters and negroes, between princes and subjects, between  nobles and roturiers, between men and women, has been for the most part  the creation of these class interests and feelings: and the sentiments  thus generated, react in turn upon the moral feelings of the members of  the ascendant class, in their relations among themselves. Where, on the  other hand, a class, formerly ascendant, has lost its ascendancy, or  where its ascendancy is unpopular, the prevailing moral sentiments  frequently bear the impress of an impatient dislike of superiority.

The head-dress consisted of a cap of fur or wool, probably decorated  with a feather, over loose and most likely very unkempt hair falling to  the shoulders. The Gauls cut their locks from the back of the head,  often tying up the remainder in a tuft on the top; no doubt the hair was  sometimes plaited or pinned up with wood, bone, or bronze ornaments.  Bone pins, teeth, and boar tusks were carried in the ears, as well as  studs of bone or stone in the underlip, and even the cheek may have been  so decorated, as it was amongst the Esquimaux. The face and body were  painted with red and white ochre and a blue stain. The neck was adorned  with strings of teeth, stones, amber, jet, bronze, and probably beads of  glass or baked clay coloured. Amulets and tokens, armlets and bracelets  were all in use. Also the torque, a twisted rod of gold flattened or  curled together at the ends, was a mark of dignity. A wristlet of wood,  bone, or leather was worn when the bow and arrows were used. The arms  were a spear of flint or bronze and a dagger of the same, a hatchet or  heavy club, a mace studded with flint or bronze spikes, and the sling,  which would have necessitated a leather wallet to carry the stones; fish  spears and snags. Also the bolas for felling cattle seems to have been  known; in fact nearly all the usual implements appertaining to savage  life were in use.    [Illustration: Plate II.--        (_a_) Elizabethan Robe in Plush. 1585-1605.      (_b_) Elizabethan Robe in Silk Brocade. 1565-85.      (_c_) Elizabethan Male Robe in Velvet Brocade. 1580-1615.

One skin lapped the other, and hardly  needed sewing together at the sides, while thus it was easier to throw  off; it may also have been tied up between the legs. The fur was worn  both inside and out, according to the weather; this large skin wrap  would also be worn cross-ways with the right shoulder free, and the  simple cloak of various lengths with a hole for the head to pass through  was no doubt one of the first discoveries in costume.    A loin cloth or skin may have been worn alone, caught up through the  legs and fastened at the back of the waist with a heavy belt and set  well down the hips. This would hold a number of personal necessities, in  the shape of a wallet and dagger. The legs would be wrapped with skins,  tied up or crossed by leather or sinew thongs, or with hemp or grass  rope. Skins were probably also used on the feet, gathered and tied above  the instep and round the ankle.    The enumeration of these items will give a pretty definite idea of how  the early race would appear in their more or less attired form. In  fighting, they cleared for action (as it were) and discarded all  clothing, their only protection being a shield of wicker or wood covered  with leather; it may have been studded with bronze plates or painted  with grotesque characters, as were their own bodies, in true savage  style, to strike fear into their enemies; it is even possible feather  decorations formed part of their \"get up.\"          CHAPTER II      THE DEVELOPMENT OF COSTUME TO THE TENTH CENTURY. FEMALE.    The female head-dress consisted chiefly of flowing hair banded with a  circlet of various shapes, but a development of braiding plaits is found  very early, and the hair was probably arranged so before the Roman era.  These plaits were generally brought over the shoulder to the front, the  hair being parted in the centre, thus making an oval forehead. Various  caps began to show originality, and jewels were set in the centre of the  forehead on the little crown-like hat, which must have been most  becoming. Squares of coloured stuffs were draped over the head and  shoulders, sometimes upon white linen squares, and many ladies began to  bind the face and head, shutting out the hair, in the 8th century. The  kerchief draping is very important to study, because it was the general  mode amongst the people.    Heavy collars of ornament and strings of beads, hanging even to the  waist, are noticeable features of these centuries, also large ear-rings.    A full cloak, with a large clasp or brooch, opened in front, or was  turned to free one shoulder; there was also a long \"drape\" thrown round  over the opposite shoulder or brought picturesquely over the head.    The ecclesiastical form of cloak as described in the male attire was  also formed about the 6th century; its graceful line was frequently  bordered completely with a band of ornament, and it was clasped just  across the breasts.    The complete circular cloak, with a hole for the head, is seen very  early, decorated with a pinked edge, which may also be noted on some of  the short dresses of the middle classes. Aprons are no doubt of the  earliest origin. A loose tunic falling to the hips was girded rather  high up the body, as in the classic dress, and bands passing both  outside or crossing between the breasts and going over the shoulder came  from the same source; these were with, or without, short sleeves to the  elbow. A long loose robe was the chief attire to the 6th century,  belted rather high in the waist, and caught up with a girdle at the  hips; these girdles gave a great interest to the early centuries, with  the art of arranging the fullness of skirt into its hold.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    From the 6th century the dress became closer fitting, and a short bodice  is seen; the neck was cut very low, either square or round in shape, and  this style had short tight sleeves or tight sleeves to the wrist. The  later tunic of the 9th century marked the beginning of the slit-open  upper sleeve, and a greater length of the neck opening, which came to be  fastened down the front to the waist.    The early skirts (to the 6th century) were hung from the hips, and were  often attached to a heavy girdle band, the fullness was gathered mostly  at the back and front; other skirts hung from a higher belt and were  again caught up in the girdle. A =V=-shaped neck setting was worn by the  Franks, from which probably came the shaped front piece that will  interest us in the 13th century. The shoes were similar to the male  shapes described later, and the same mode of binding the stockings was  sometimes imitated.      THE DEVELOPMENT OF COSTUME TO THE TENTH CENTURY. MALE.    In taking the long period from the Roman occupation to the 10th century,  we can discover a real development of style in costume, as with the  system of vassalage a distinction of class arose. No doubt the Romans  introduced a finer tuition of weaving, needlecraft, decoration, and  dyeing; and later the various peoples coming from the Continent, when  settled under Alfred in the 9th century, produced a solid style of  barbaric splendour.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    The male hair dressing, from the rugged mass of hair, soon became well  combed and trimmed square across the neck: ear-rings may still have been  in use by some nobles till the 11th century, and chaplets were worn upon  the hair. The Saxon beard was divided into two points. Small round tight  caps of wool, fur, or velvet, and rush or straw hats of a definite shape  were in use to the 10th century. Tight caps, with lappets tied under the  chin, and hoods appear on the short capes about the 8th century, or  probably earlier. The garment was of the simplest form, cut like a  plain square loose shirt to the middle of the thigh, and this was put on  over the head. The opening to pass the head through was the first part  to receive a band of decoration. The sides were sometimes opened to the  hips and the front caught between the legs and held at the waist. A  garment opened down the front, and another wrapped across to either  shoulder is also seen. A belt girt the waist, and the tunic was pulled  loosely over it. This also carried the essential requirements in the  shape of a pouch, dagger, knife, comb, sword, &c. The neck was  ornamented with chains of bronze, gold, beads, and charms, and up to the  8th century a bronze ornamental armlet was worn, besides a wristlet.    The men of the ruling class from the 8th century were clothed in a long  garment of simple shape, falling to the ankle, richly bordered at the  hem and neck. This generally had long tight sleeves, and often over this  a shorter tunic, reaching just below the knee, sometimes sleeveless, or  with rather full sleeves tightening to the wrist.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    A plain square chasuble shape was in fashion from the 8th century,  reaching to the bottom of the calf of the leg, and richer materials  began to be used; no belt was passed round this, as it was allowed to  fall straight.    Loose breeches were worn from very early times, and a loose trouser to  the ankle, being tied there or bound crosswise from the boot sometimes  right up the thigh. The same binding was done even with the bare legs  and later hose: close-fitting short breeches and cloth hose became a  feature in the 10th century, and with the latter an ornamental  knee-piece or garter below the knee sometimes finished the strappings.    The cloak was the \"grand garment,\" heavily banded with ornament and  fastened with a large clasp on one shoulder, or at the centre of the  breast. Long circular cloaks of varying lengths, put on over the head,  were much favoured, and when caught up at the sides on either shoulder  gave a fine draped effect.
