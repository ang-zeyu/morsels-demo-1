And, when he did publish them, he used the happy device  of dedicating his great book to the Pope, and a cardinal bore the  expense of printing it. Thus did the Roman Church stand sponsor to a  system of truth against which it was destined in the next century to  hurl its anathemas, and to inflict on its conspicuous adherents torture,  imprisonment, and death.    To realize the change of thought, the utterly new view of the universe,  which the Copernican theory introduced, we must go back to preceding  ages, and try to recall the views which had been held as probable  concerning the form of the earth and the motion of the heavenly bodies.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Homeric Cosmogony.]    The earliest recorded notion of the earth is the very natural one that  it is a flat area floating in an illimitable ocean. The sun was a god  who drove his chariot across the heavens once a day; and Anaxagoras was  threatened with death and punished with banishment for teaching that the  sun was only a ball of fire, and that it might perhaps be as big as the  country of Greece. The obvious difficulty as to how the sun got back to  the east again every morning was got over--not by the conjecture that he  went back in the dark, nor by the idea that there was a fresh sun every  day; though, indeed, it was once believed that the moon was created once  a month, and periodically cut up into stars--but by the doctrine that in  the northern part of the earth was a high range of mountains, and that  the sun travelled round on the surface of the sea behind these.  Sometimes, indeed, you find a representation of the sun being rowed  round in a boat. Later on it was perceived to be necessary that the sun  should be able to travel beneath the earth, and so the earth was  supposed to be supported on pillars or on roots, or to be a dome-shaped  body floating in air--much like Dean Swift's island of Laputa. The  elephant and tortoise of the Hindu earth are, no doubt, emblematic or  typical, not literal.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Egyptian Symbol of the Universe.    The earth a figure with leaves, the heaven a figure with stars, the  principle of equilibrium and support, the boats of the rising and  setting sun.]    Aristotle, however, taught that the earth must be a sphere, and used all  the orthodox arguments of the present children's geography-books about  the way you see ships at sea, and about lunar eclipses.    To imagine a possible antipodes must, however, have been a tremendous  difficulty in the way of this conception of a sphere, and I scarcely  suppose that any one can at that time have contemplated the possibility  of such upside-down regions being inhabited. I find that intelligent  children invariably feel the greatest difficulty in realizing the  existence of inhabitants on the opposite side of the earth. Stupid  children, like stupid persons in general, will of course believe  anything they are told, and much good may the belief do them; but the  kind of difficulties felt by intelligent and thoughtful children are  most instructive, since it is quite certain that the early philosophers  must have encountered and overcome those very same difficulties by their  own genius.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Hindoo Earth.]    However, somehow or other the conception of a spherical earth was  gradually grasped, and the heavenly bodies were perceived all to revolve  round it: some moving regularly, as the stars, all fixed together into  one spherical shell or firmament; some moving irregularly and apparently  anomalously--these irregular bodies were therefore called planets [or  wanderers]. Seven of them were known, viz. Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun,  Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and there is little doubt that this number seven,  so suggested, is the origin of the seven days of the week.         The above order of the ancient planets is that of their supposed       distance from the earth. Not always, however, are they thus quoted       by the ancients: sometimes the sun is supposed nearer than Mercury       or Venus. It has always been known that the moon was the nearest of       the heavenly bodies; and some rough notion of its distance was       current. Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were placed in that order       because that is the order of their apparent motions, and it was       natural to suppose that the slowest moving bodies were the furthest       off.         The order of the days of the week shows what astrologers considered       to be the order of the planets; on their system of each successive       hour of the day being ruled over by the successive planets taken in       order. The diagram (fig. 7) shows that if the Sun rule the first       hour of a certain day (thereby giving its name to the day) Venus       will rule the second hour, Mercury the third, and so on; the Sun       will thus be found to rule the eighth, fifteenth, and twenty-second       hour of that day, Venus the twenty-third, and Mercury the       twenty-fourth hour; so the Moon will rule the first hour of the       next day, which will therefore be Monday. On the same principle       (numbering round the hours successively, with the arrows) the first       hour of the next day will be found to be ruled by Mars, or by the       Saxon deity corresponding thereto; the first hour of the day after,       by Mercury (_Mercredi_), and so on (following the straight lines of       the pattern).         The order of the planets round the circle counter-clockwise, _i.e._       the direction of their proper motions, is that quoted above in the       text.    To explain the motion of the planets and reduce them to any sort of law  was a work of tremendous difficulty. The greatest astronomer of ancient  times was Hipparchus, and to him the system known as the Ptolemaic  system is no doubt largely due. But it was delivered to the world mainly  by Ptolemy, and goes by his name. This was a fine piece of work, and a  great advance on anything that had gone before; for although it is of  course saturated with error, still it is based on a large substratum of  truth. Its superiority to all the previously mentioned systems is  obvious. And it really did in its more developed form describe the  observed motions of the planets.    Each planet was, in the early stages of this system, as taught, say, by  Eudoxus, supposed to be set in a crystal sphere, which revolved so as to  carry the planet with it. The sphere had to be of crystal to account for  the visibility of other planets and the stars through it. Outside the  seven planetary spheres, arranged one inside the other, was a still  larger one in which were set the stars. This was believed to turn all  the others, and was called the _primum mobile_. The whole system was  supposed to produce, in its revolution, for the few privileged to hear  the music of the spheres, a sound as of some magnificent harmony.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Order of ancient planets corresponding to the  days of the week.]    The enthusiastic disciples of Pythagoras believed that their master was  privileged to hear this noble chant; and far be it from us to doubt  that the rapt and absorbing pleasure of contemplating the harmony of  nature, to a man so eminently great as Pythagoras, must be truly and  adequately represented by some such poetic conception.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Ptolemaic system.]    The precise kind of motion supposed to be communicated from the _primum  mobile_ to the other spheres so as to produce the observed motions of  the planets was modified and improved by various philosophers until it  developed into the epicyclic train of Hipparchus and of Ptolemy.    It is very instructive to observe a planet (say Mars or Jupiter) night  after night and plot down its place with reference to the fixed stars  on a celestial globe or star-map. Or, instead of direct observation by  alignment with known stars, it is easier to look out its right ascension  and declination in _Whitaker's Almanac_, and plot those down. If this be  done for a year or two, it will be found that the motion of the planet  is by no means regular, but that though on the whole it advances it  sometimes is stationary and sometimes goes back.[1]    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Specimens of Apparent paths of Venus and of Mars  among the stars.]    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Apparent epicyclic orbits of Jupiter and  Saturn; the Earth being supposed fixed at the centre, with the Sun  revolving in a small circle. A loop is made by each planet every year.]    These \"stations\" and \"retrogressions\" of the planets were well known to  the ancients. It was not to be supposed for a moment that the crystal  spheres were subject to any irregularity, neither was uniform circular  motion to be readily abandoned; so it was surmised that the main sphere  carried, not the planet itself, but the centre or axis of a subordinate  sphere, and that the planet was carried by this. The minor sphere could  be allowed to revolve at a different uniform pace from the main sphere,  and so a curve of some complexity could be obtained.    A curve described in space by a point of a circle or sphere, which  itself is carried along at the same time, is some kind of cycloid; if  the centre of the tracing circle travels along a straight line, we get  the ordinary cycloid, the curve traced in air by a nail on a  coach-wheel; but if the centre of the tracing circle be carried round  another circle the curve described is called an epicycloid. By such  curves the planetary stations and retrogressions could be explained. A  large sphere would have to revolve once for a \"year\" of the particular  planet, carrying with it a subsidiary sphere in which the planet was  fixed; this latter sphere revolving once for a \"year\" of the earth.

He  turned on his side and slipped to the floor with the agility of a  youngster. The dog snarled anew, but kept steadfastly to his position.           *       *       *       *       *    There was a small mirror over the wash stand at the far end of the room  and Old Crompton made haste to obtain the first view of his reflected  image. His step was firm and springy, his bearing confident, and he  found that his long-stooped shoulders straightened naturally and easily.  He felt that he had taken on at least two inches in stature, which was  indeed the case. When he reached the mirror he peered anxiously into its  dingy surface and what he saw there so startled him that he stepped  backward in amazement. This was not Larry Crompton, but an entirely new  man. The straggly white hair had given way to soft, healthy waves of  chestnut hue. Gone were the seams from the leathery countenance and the  eyes looked out clearly and steadily from under brows as thick and dark  as they had been in his youth. The reflected features were those of an  entire stranger. They were not even reminiscent of the Larry Crompton of  fifty years ago, but were the features of a far more vigorous and  prepossessing individual than he had ever seemed, even in the best years  of his life. The jaw was firm, the once sunken cheeks so well filled out  that his high cheek bones were no longer in evidence. It was the face of  a man of not more than thirty-eight years of age, reflecting exceptional  intelligence and strength of character.    \"What a disguise!\" he exclaimed in delight. And his voice, echoing in  the stillness that followed the switching off of the apparatus, was  deep-throated and mellow--the voice of a new man.    Now, serenely confident that discovery was impossible, he picked up his  small but heavy bag and started for the door. Dawn was breaking and he  wished to put as many miles between himself and Tom's laboratory as  could be covered in the next few hours. But at the door he hesitated.  Then, despite the furious yapping of Spot, he returned to the table of  the rays and, with deliberate thoroughness smashed the costly tubes  which had brought about his rehabilitation. With a pinch bar from a  nearby tool rack, he wrecked the controls and generating mechanisms  beyond recognition. Now he was absolutely secure! No meddling experts  could possibly discover the secret of Tom's invention. All evidence  would show that the young experimenter had met his death at the hands of  Old Crompton, the despised hermit of West Laketon. But none would dream  that the handsome man of means who was henceforth to be known as George  Voight was that same despised hermit.    He recovered his satchel and left the scene. With long, rapid strides he  proceeded down the old dirt road toward the main highway where, instead  of turning east into the village, he would turn west and walk to  Kernsburg, the neighboring town. There, in not more than two hours time,  his new life would really begin!           *       *       *       *       *    Had you, a visitor, departed from Laketon when Old Crompton did and  returned twelve years later, you would have noticed very little  difference in the appearance of the village. The old town hall and the  little park were the same, the dingy brick building among the trees  being just a little dingier and its wooden steps more worn and sagged.  The main street showed evidence of recent repaving, and, in consequence  of the resulting increase in through automobile traffic; there were two  new gasoline filling stations in the heart of the town. Down the road  about a half mile there was a new building, which, upon inquiring from  one of the natives, would be proudly designated as the new high school  building. Otherwise there were no changes to be observed.    In his dilapidated chair in the untidy office he had occupied for nearly  thirty years, sat Asa Culkin, popularly known as \"Judge\" Culkin. Justice  of the peace, sheriff, attorney-at-law, and three times Mayor of  Laketon, he was still a controlling factor in local politics and  government. And many a knotty legal problem was settled in that gloomy  little office. Many a dispute in the town council was dependent for  arbitration upon the keen mind and understanding wit of the old judge.    The four o'clock train had just puffed its labored way from the station  when a stranger entered his office, a stranger of uncommonly prosperous  air. The keen blue eyes of the old attorney appraised him instantly and  classified him as a successful man of business, not yet forty years of  age, and with a weighty problem on his mind.    \"What can I do for you, sir?\" he asked, removing his feet from the  battered desk top.    \"You may be able to help me a great deal, Judge,\" was the unexpected  reply. \"I came to Laketon to give myself up.\"    \"Give yourself up?\" Culkin rose to his feet in surprise and  unconsciously straightened his shoulders in the effort to seem less  dwarfed before the tall stranger. \"Why, what do you mean?\" he inquired.           *       *       *       *       *    \"I wish to give myself up for murder,\" answered the amazing visitor,  slowly and with decision, \"for a murder committed twelve years ago. I  should like you to listen to my story first, though. It has been kept  too long.\"    \"But I still do not understand.\" There was puzzlement in the honest old  face of the attorney. He shook his gray locks in uncertainty. \"Why  should you come here? Why come to me? What possible interest can I have  in the matter?\"    \"Just this, Judge. You do not recognize me now, and you will probably  consider my story incredible when you hear it. But, when I have given  you all the evidence, you will know who I am and will be compelled to  believe. The murder was committed in Laketon. That is why I came to  you.\"    \"A murder in Laketon? Twelve years ago?\" Again the aged attorney shook  his head. \"But--proceed.\"    \"Yes. I killed Thomas Forsythe.\"    The stranger looked for an expression of horror in the features of his  listener, but there was none. Instead the benign countenance took on a  look of deepening amazement, but the smile wrinkles had somehow vanished  and the old face was grave in its surprised interest.    \"You seem astonished,\" continued the stranger. \"Undoubtedly you were  convinced that the murderer was Larry Crompton--Old Crompton, the  hermit. He disappeared the night of the crime and has never been heard  from since. Am I correct?\"    \"Yes. He disappeared all right. But continue.\"    Not by a lift of his eyebrow did Culkin betray his disbelief, but the  stranger sensed that his story was somehow not as startling as it should  have been.    \"You will think me crazy, I presume. But I am Old Crompton. It was my  hand that felled the unfortunate young man in his laboratory out there  in West Laketon twelve years ago to-night. It was his marvelous  invention that transformed the old hermit into the apparently young man  you see before you. But I swear that I am none other than Larry Crompton  and that I killed young Forsythe. I am ready to pay the penalty. I can  bear the flagellation of my own conscience no longer.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The visitor's voice had risen to the point of hysteria. But his listener  remained calm and unmoved.    \"Now just let me get this straight,\" he said quietly. \"Do I understand  that you claim to be Old Crompton, rejuvenated in some mysterious  manner, and that you killed Tom Forsythe on that night twelve years ago?  Do I understand that you wish now to go to trial for that crime and to  pay the penalty?\"    \"Yes! Yes! And the sooner the better. I can stand it no longer. I am the  most miserable man in the world!\"    \"Hm-m--hm-m,\" muttered the judge, \"this is strange.\" He spoke soothingly  to his visitor. \"Do not upset yourself, I beg of you. I will take care  of this thing for you, never fear. Just take a seat, Mister--er--\"    \"You may call me Voight for the present,\" said the stranger, in a more  composed tone of voice, \"George Voight. That is the name I have been  using since the mur--since that fatal night.\"    \"Very well, Mr. Voight,\" replied the counsellor with an air of the  greatest solicitude, \"please have a seat now, while I make a telephone  call.\"    And George Voight slipped into a stiff-backed chair with a sigh of  relief. For he knew the judge from the old days and he was now certain  that his case would be disposed of very quickly.    With the telephone receiver pressed to his ear, Culkin repeated a  number. The stranger listened intently during the ensuing silence. Then  there came a muffled \"hello\" sounding in impatient response to the call.    \"Hello, Alton,\" spoke the attorney, \"this is Asa speaking. A stranger  has just stepped into my office and he claims to be Old Crompton.  Remember the hermit across the road from your son's old laboratory?  Well, this man, who bears no resemblance whatever to the old man he  claims to be and who seems to be less than half the age of Tom's old  neighbor, says that he killed Tom on that night we remember so well.\"           *       *       *       *       *    There were some surprised remarks from the other end of the wire, but  Voight was unable to catch them. He was in a cold perspiration at the  thought of meeting his victim's father.    \"Why, yes, Alton,\" continued Culkin, \"I think there is something in this  story, although I cannot believe it all. But I wish you would accompany  us and visit the laboratory. Will you?\"    \"Lord, man, not that!\" interrupted the judge's visitor. \"I can hardly  bear to visit the scene of my crime--and in the company of Alton  Forsythe. Please, not that!\"    \"Now you just let me take care of this, young man,\" replied the judge,  testily. Then, once more speaking into the mouthpiece of the telephone,  \"All right, Alton. We'll pick you up at your office in"]]]
