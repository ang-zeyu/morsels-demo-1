The empress was so pleased with the change that  she personally complimented Michael, and made him a present of 24  ducats.    Dismissed from St Stephen's    One thing leads to another. Reutter, it is obvious, did not like Haydn,  and any opportunity of playing toady to the empress was too good to  be lost. Unfortunately Haydn himself provided the opportunity. Having  become possessed of a new pair of scissors, he was itching to try their  quality. The pig-tail of the chorister sitting before him offered an  irresistible attraction; one snip and lo! the plaited hair lay at his  feet. Discipline must be maintained; and Reutter sentenced the culprit  to be caned on the hand. This was too great an indignity for poor  Joseph, by this time a youth of seventeen--old enough, one would have  thought, to have forsworn such boyish mischief. He declared that  he would rather leave the cathedral service than submit. \"You shall  certainly leave,\" retorted the Capellmeister, \"but you must be caned  first.\" And so, having received his caning, Haydn was sent adrift on  the streets of Vienna, a broken-voiced chorister, without a coin in  his pocket, and with only poverty staring him in the face. This was in  November 1749.        CHAPTER II.

Vienna    The Vienna into which Haydn was thus cast, a friendless and forlorn  youth of seventeen, was not materially different from the Vienna of  to-day. While the composer was still living, one who had made his  acquaintance wrote of the city: \"Represent to yourself an assemblage of  palaces and very neat houses, inhabited by the most opulent families of  one of the greatest monarchies in Europe--by the only noblemen to  whom that title may still be with justice applied. The women here are  attractive; a brilliant complexion adorns an elegant form; the natural  but sometimes languishing and tiresome air of the ladies of the north of  Germany is mingled with a little coquetry and address, the effect of the  presence of a numerous Court...In a word, pleasure has taken possession  of every heart.\" This was written when Haydn was old and famous; it  might have been written when his name was yet unknown.    Vienna was essentially a city of pleasure--a city inhabited by \"a proud  and wealthy nobility, a prosperous middle class, and a silent, if not  contented, lower class.\" In 1768, Leopold Mozart, the father of the  composer, declared that the Viennese public had no love of anything  serious or sensible; \"they cannot even understand it, and their theatres  furnish abundant proof that nothing but utter trash, such as dances,  burlesques, harlequinades, ghost tricks, and devils' antics will go down  with them.\" There is, no doubt, a touch of exaggeration in all this,  but it is sufficiently near the truth to let us understand the kind of  attention which the disgraced chorister of St Stephen's was likely to  receive from the musical world of Vienna. It was Vienna, we may recall,  which dumped Mozart into a pauper's grave, and omitted even to mark the  spot.    The Forlorn Ex-Chorister    Young Haydn, then, was wandering, weary and perplexed, through its  streets, with threadbare clothes on his back and nothing in his purse.  There was absolutely no one to whom he could think of turning. He might,  indeed, have taken the road to Rohrau and been sure of a warm welcome  from his humble parents there. But there were good reasons why he should  not make himself a burden on them; and, moreover, he probably feared  that at home he would run some risk of being tempted to abandon his  cherished profession. Frau Haydn had not yet given up the hope of seeing  her boy made a priest, and though we have no definite information that  Haydn himself felt a decided aversion to taking orders, it is evident  that he was disinclined to hazard the danger of domestic pressure. He  had now finally made up his mind that he would be a composer; but he saw  clearly enough that, for the present, he must work, and work, too, not  for fame, but for bread.    A Good Samaritan    Musing on these things while still parading the streets, tired and  hungry, he met one Spangler, a tenor singer of his acquaintance, who  earned a pittance at the Church of St Michael. Spangler was a poor  man--but it is ever the poor who are most helpful to each other--and,  taking pity on the dejected outcast, he invited Haydn to share his  garret rooms along with his wife and child. It is regrettable that  nothing more is known of this good Samaritan--one of those obscure  benefactors who go through the world doing little acts of kindness,  never perhaps even suspecting how far-reaching will be the results. He  must have died before Haydn, otherwise his name would certainly have  appeared in his will.    Haydn Enskied    Haydn remained with Spangler in that \"ghastly garret\" all through the  winter of 1749-1750. He has been commiserated on the garret--needlessly,  to be sure. Garrets are famous, in literary annals at any rate; and is  it not Leigh Hunt who reminds us that the top story is healthier than  the basement? The poor poet in Pope, who lay high in Drury Lane, \"lull'd  by soft zephyrs through the broken pane,\" found profit, doubtless,  in his \"neighbourhood with the stars.\" However that may be, there, in  Spangler's attic, was Haydn enskied, eager for work--work of any kind,  so long as it had fellowship with music and brought him the bare means  of subsistence.         \"Scanning his whole horizon       In quest of what he could clap eyes on,\"    he sought any and every means of making money. He tried to get teaching,  with what success has not been recorded. He sang in choirs, played at  balls and weddings and baptisms, made \"arrangements\" for anybody who  would employ him, and in short drudged very much as Wagner did at the  outset of his tempestuous career.    Street Serenades    He even took part in street serenades by playing the violin. This last  was not a very dignified occupation; but it is important to remember  that serenading in Vienna was not the lover's business of Italy and  Spain, where the singer is accompanied by guitar or mandoline. It was a  much more serious entertainment. It dated from the seventeenth century,  if we are to trust Praetorius, and consisted of solos and concerted  vocal music in various forms, accompanied sometimes by full orchestra  and sometimes by wind instruments alone. Great composers occasionally  honoured their patrons and friends with the serenade; and composers who  hoped to be great found it advantageous as a means of gaining a hearing  for their works. It proved of some real service to Haydn later on, but  in the meantime it does not appear to have swelled his lean purse. With  all his industry he fell into the direst straits now and again, and was  more than once driven into wild projects by sheer stress of hunger.    Joins a Pilgrim Party    One curious story is told of a journey to Mariazell, in Styria.  This picturesquely-situated village has been for many years the most  frequented shrine in Austria. To-day it is said to be visited by  something like 100,000 pilgrims every year. The object of adoration  is the miraculous image of the Madonna and Child, twenty inches high,  carved in lime-wood, which was presented to the Mother Church of  Mariazell in 1157 by a Benedictine priest. Haydn was a devout Catholic,  and not improbably knew all about Mariazell and its Madonna. At any  rate, he joined a company of pilgrims, and on arrival presented himself  to the local choirmaster for admission, showing the official some of his  compositions, and telling of his eight years' training at St Stephen's.  The choirmaster was not impressed. \"I have had enough of lazy rascals  from Vienna,\" said he. \"Be off!\" But Haydn, after coming so far, was not  to be dismissed so unceremoniously. He smuggled himself into the choir,  pleaded with the solo singer of the day to be allowed to act as his  deputy, and, when this was refused, snatched the music from the singer's  hand, and took up the solo at the right moment with such success that  \"all the choir held their breath to listen.\" At the close of the service  the choirmaster sent for him, and, apologizing for his previous rude  behaviour, invited him to his house for the day. The invitation extended  to a week, and Haydn returned to Vienna with money enough--the result of  a subscription among the choir--to serve his immediate needs.    An Unconditional Loan    But it would have been strange if, in a musical city like Vienna, a  youth of Haydn's gifts had been allowed to starve. Slowly but surely he  made his way, and people who could help began to hear of him. The most  notable of his benefactors at this time was a worthy tradesman named  Buchholz, who made him an unconditional loan of 150 florins. An echo of  this unexpected favour is heard long years after in the composer's will,  where we read: \"To Fraulein Anna Buchholz, 100 florins, inasmuch as in  my youth her grandfather lent me 150 florins when I greatly needed them,  which, however, I repaid fifty years ago.\"    \"Attic\" Studies    One hundred and fifty florins was no great sum assuredly, but at this  time it was a small fortune to Haydn. He was able to do a good many  things with it. First of all, he took a lodging for himself--another  attic! Spangler had been very kind, but he could not give the young  musician the privacy needed for study. It chanced that there was a room"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37901"],[0,"Profitable Squab Breeding (#4)"],[1," by the birds. Nests made in this way are very easily cleaned,  as the shelves may be drawn out and cleaned without trouble.      NAPPIES    Nappies are dishes or bowls of a peculiar shape which are made for  pigeon nests. These nappies are used by a great many pigeon-breeders,  but we have not found them necessary as the birds are perfectly able to  build their own nests and will do so if the nest boxes are provided.    Where only a few pairs of birds are kept, we have seen boxes used for  nests. Boxes about the size of orange crates are used, these being  divided into two compartments and fastened to the wall by nails driven  through the bottom. We recommend that regular nests be provided as they  give a nearer appearance to the lofts and are more easily cleaned.      NESTING MATERIAL      A good supply of nesting material should be provided for the pigeons.  This may be short straw, or coarse hay in short lengths, but the best  material is tobacco stems which may be bought at about one cent a pound  from the stores that keep pigeon and poultry supplies. These tobacco  stems prevent insects from being harbored in the nests and save a great  deal of trouble in this way. The ideal nest is one made of tobacco stems  for a foundation and then finished with soft straw.      [Illustration: Fig. 4. Showing a Cheap and Convenient Arrangement    for Nests. Many Breeders Prefer to Use This Style of Nest Box    Without the Nappies, Tacking a Strip Across the Front to Hold the    Nesting Material.]      WATER FOUNTAINS    Pigeons are great drinkers and should be watered at least twice a day as  they need a plentiful supply of fresh water. The best way to supply this  is by using the regular watering fountains which are made for this  purpose. These may be bought through almost any breeder who sells  pigeons. If the one of whom the pigeons are bought does not keep them  for sale, he will give the name of a firm which handles them. These  fountains cost only a small sum and they keep the water clean, whereas  if open water vessels are used, the water becomes foul with dirt and  dust.      BATHING    Pigeons must be provided with facilities for bathing, as they will not  keep in good health if they cannot have a bath regularly. They delight  in getting into water and bathing themselves all over. An ordinary big  dishpan makes a good bath-tub for pigeons, or a barrel so cut off as to  be four inches deep makes a good tub for bathing purposes. Empty the  bath-tub as soon as the pigeons have finished their baths to prevent  them from drinking the foul water.      SANITATION    A pigeon loft must be kept free from insects and disease germs by  carefully attending to sanitary conditions. The free use of  lice-killers, cleaning the nests out as soon as the squabs are taken  from them and whitewashing the whole interior of the loft at least twice  a year will keep the enemies of the birds from gaining a foothold, as  well as destroy stray disease germs which may be floating in the air.      DRYNESS    Pigeons must have a dry loft or they will fall victims to disease. To  keep the houses dry they should have the floor at least a foot from the  ground and the location should be such that water does not stand around  the house or under it. Make the floor double, so that it will be  air-tight and let the air circulate under the house freely. Two objects  are accomplished by having the floor off the ground; the rooms are kept  dry and rats will not burrow under the house.      FLOOR COVERING    The floor of the pigeon houses should be kept covered with about an inch  of sand, if this can be procured handily. Otherwise keep it covered with  chaff, which should frequently be renewed.      [Illustration: Fig. 5. Showing Construction of Crate for Nesting    Material.      The cover is removable and protects the material from the droppings    and filth. Tobacco stems, straw or hay cut into lengths of six or    eight inches, should be kept before the birds at all times and this    crate is the handiest and best way to furnish this material.]      CLEANLINESS    It is necessary to keep the pigeon lofts clean. Some breeders advocate  cleaning them every week, we think a good cleaning once a month will do.  Every time the lofts are cleaned, the birds must be disturbed more or  less, and this results in some little loss, so the matter of cleanliness  should not be carried to extreme. If the house is dry and light, the  droppings will quickly dry up and will not become offensive for several  weeks.      [Illustration: Fig. 6. Showing Ground Plan of House No. 1.]      [Illustration: Fig. 7. Showing Ground Plan of House No. 2.]          CHAPTER IV    FEEDS AND FEEDING--BREEDING HABITS      Pigeons are exclusive grain eaters. They do not require animal food of  any kind, nor is green food necessary for them. Occasionally a nice  tender head of lettuce may be given to each loft and they will eat it  with relish, but such green foods as grass, lawn clippings, or cut  clover should never be given them. The lettuce is not necessary but may  be given by way of variety, but not more than one head to fifty pairs of  birds.    The principal feeds are red wheat, sifted cracked corn, Canada peas,  kaffir corn, hemp seed and German millet seed. Besides these, buckwheat,  barley, and canary seed may sometimes be given; but the first-named  constitute a good variety and should be used as a constant feed. All of  them are necessary and they should be properly rotated.      SOUND GRAIN NECESSARY    We want to emphasize the fact that all grain used for feeding pigeons  must be sound and wholesome. It is the very poorest kind of economy to  feed shrunken, musty, or damaged grain of any kind.      WHEAT    The wheat used should be sound red wheat which has been thoroughly  dried. New wheat should never be used. Good No. 2 red wheat, at least  six months out of the straw, should be selected.      PEANUTS    In many localities Canada Peas are so high in price that breeders can  hardly afford to feed them but the cheapest raw peanuts may be obtained  at a low price and these will take the place of the Canada Peas and give  just the same results. I have found them very satisfactory as a feed and  hundreds of my customers have reported excellent results with them.      CRACKED CORN    Sound, well dried, No. 2 sifted cracked corn should be used for pigeons.  By well dried, we mean that the corn should be of the crop of the  previous year. It should be cracked so that the pieces will be about the  size of wheat grains. It should be sifted to separate the fine meal, as  the pigeons will not eat the meal and if it is left in the food troughs  it will sour and produce bowel trouble in the birds, old and young.      CANADA PEAS    Canada peas should be well dried out, selecting those of the previous  year as they are thoroughly dry and sound. This is the highest priced  feed the pigeon-keeper will need to buy but it is not fed largely, being  used sparingly on account of the great nutritive qualities, which cause  squabs to grow rapidly and make heavy breast meat.      KAFFIR CORN    Kaffir corn has become a regular article of sale and can be bought  almost anywhere. It is between wheat and corn in value and makes a very  good pigeon feed. Buy seed of the previous year when buying for pigeons.      HEMP SEED    But a small quantity of hemp seed is used. If too much were given the  birds they would become very fat and get lazy. A good plan is to throw a  handful of hemp seed on the floor once a week on a stated day, say  Wednesday. Never put hemp seed in a feed trough, as the first birds to  get to the trough would \"hog\" all the seed.      MILLET SEED    The seed of the German millet makes an excellent pigeon feed. It also is  quite fattening and must be used sparingly. It is usually quite cheap,  compared with its food value, and should be kept on hand at all times.      BUCKWHEAT    Buckwheat is very fattening and should be fed sparingly. The  pigeon-breeder need not take any special pains to get it for his birds,  but in some localities buckwheat is raised extensively and in these  places the grain may be used by way of variety. Buckwheat is very  heating and therefore is best used in severe cold weather.      CANARY SEED    Canary seed is too costly to use as a regular feed, but birds relish a  small feed once in a while. In some parts of this country canary seed  might be grown very easily and it would find a large sale if enough of  it were produced to meet the demand which would soon grow up.      [Illustration: Fig. 8. Showing End View of House No. 2.]      OTHER FOOD REQUISITES    Pigeons require, besides the grain they eat, salt, grit, and charcoal.  These should be kept in the lofts constantly, so that the birds can get  at them at any time.      GRIT    Pigeons must have grit and plenty of it at all times. Moreover this grit  should contain some tonic mixture and other essentials to keep the birds  in the best of working order. Many breeders fail to supply their birds  with grit of the right sort and for that reason do not get the best  results from their birds.    There are many so-called \"Health Grits\" on the market and many of them  with more or less merit but grits are heavy and freight and express  charges are high so it is usually best for the breeder to secure clean  sharp sand and mix the grit at home. There is great saving in this and  at the same time better results are obtained.      SALT    Salt is absolutely necessary to the health of the pigeons. It should  never be given them in the form of table salt, because they will eat too  much of it. If rock salt can be secured, it is the best form in which to  give salt to the pigeons. If this is not procurable, buy a five-pound  bag of table salt and wet it. Then put it in the oven and dry it, when  it will become almost as hard as the original rock salt. Put a bag in  each loft and let the pigeons pick out "]]]
