And  between the two Places where these Images appeared distinct there was  the distance of an Inch and a half; the distance of the white Paper from  the Lens, when the Image of the red half of the coloured Paper appeared  most distinct, being greater by an Inch and an half than the distance of  the same white Paper from the Lens, when the Image of the blue half  appeared most distinct. In like Incidences therefore of the blue and red  upon the Lens, the blue was refracted more by the Lens than the red, so  as to converge sooner by an Inch and a half, and therefore is more  refrangible.    _Illustration._ In the twelfth Figure (p. 27), DE signifies the coloured  Paper, DG the blue half, FE the red half, MN the Lens, HJ the white  Paper in that Place where the red half with its black Lines appeared  distinct, and _hi_ the same Paper in that Place where the blue half  appeared distinct. The Place _hi_ was nearer to the Lens MN than the  Place HJ by an Inch and an half.    _Scholium._ The same Things succeed, notwithstanding that some of the  Circumstances be varied; as in the first Experiment when the Prism and  Paper are any ways inclined to the Horizon, and in both when coloured  Lines are drawn upon very black Paper. But in the Description of these  Experiments, I have set down such Circumstances, by which either the  Phaenomenon might be render'd more conspicuous, or a Novice might more  easily try them, or by which I did try them only. The same Thing, I have  often done in the following Experiments: Concerning all which, this one  Admonition may suffice. Now from these Experiments it follows not, that  all the Light of the blue is more refrangible than all the Light of the  red: For both Lights are mixed of Rays differently refrangible, so that  in the red there are some Rays not less refrangible than those of the  blue, and in the blue there are some Rays not more refrangible than  those of the red: But these Rays, in proportion to the whole Light, are  but few, and serve to diminish the Event of the Experiment, but are not  able to destroy it. For, if the red and blue Colours were more dilute  and weak, the distance of the Images would be less than an Inch and a  half; and if they were more intense and full, that distance would be  greater, as will appear hereafter. These Experiments may suffice for the  Colours of Natural Bodies. For in the Colours made by the Refraction of  Prisms, this Proposition will appear by the Experiments which are now to  follow in the next Proposition.      _PROP._ II. THEOR. II.    _The Light of the Sun consists of Rays differently Refrangible._    The PROOF by Experiments.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    _Exper._ 3.    In a very dark Chamber, at a round Hole, about one third Part of an Inch  broad, made in the Shut of a Window, I placed a Glass Prism, whereby the  Beam of the Sun's Light, which came in at that Hole, might be refracted  upwards toward the opposite Wall of the Chamber, and there form a  colour'd Image of the Sun. The Axis of the Prism (that is, the Line  passing through the middle of the Prism from one end of it to the other  end parallel to the edge of the Refracting Angle) was in this and the  following Experiments perpendicular to the incident Rays. About this  Axis I turned the Prism slowly, and saw the refracted Light on the Wall,  or coloured Image of the Sun, first to descend, and then to ascend.  Between the Descent and Ascent, when the Image seemed Stationary, I  stopp'd the Prism, and fix'd it in that Posture, that it should be moved  no more. For in that Posture the Refractions of the Light at the two  Sides of the refracting Angle, that is, at the Entrance of the Rays into  the Prism, and at their going out of it, were equal to one another.[C]  So also in other Experiments, as often as I would have the Refractions  on both sides the Prism to be equal to one another, I noted the Place  where the Image of the Sun formed by the refracted Light stood still  between its two contrary Motions, in the common Period of its Progress  and Regress; and when the Image fell upon that Place, I made fast the  Prism. And in this Posture, as the most convenient, it is to be  understood that all the Prisms are placed in the following Experiments,  unless where some other Posture is described. The Prism therefore being  placed in this Posture, I let the refracted Light fall perpendicularly  upon a Sheet of white Paper at the opposite Wall of the Chamber, and  observed the Figure and Dimensions of the Solar Image formed on the  Paper by that Light. This Image was Oblong and not Oval, but terminated  with two Rectilinear and Parallel Sides, and two Semicircular Ends. On  its Sides it was bounded pretty distinctly, but on its Ends very  confusedly and indistinctly, the Light there decaying and vanishing by  degrees. The Breadth of this Image answered to the Sun's Diameter, and  was about two Inches and the eighth Part of an Inch, including the  Penumbra. For the Image was eighteen Feet and an half distant from the  Prism, and at this distance that Breadth, if diminished by the Diameter  of the Hole in the Window-shut, that is by a quarter of an Inch,  subtended an Angle at the Prism of about half a Degree, which is the  Sun's apparent Diameter. But the Length of the Image was about ten  Inches and a quarter, and the Length of the Rectilinear Sides about  eight Inches; and the refracting Angle of the Prism, whereby so great a  Length was made, was 64 degrees. With a less Angle the Length of the  Image was less, the Breadth remaining the same. If the Prism was turned  about its Axis that way which made the Rays emerge more obliquely out of  the second refracting Surface of the Prism, the Image soon became an  Inch or two longer, or more; and if the Prism was turned about the  contrary way, so as to make the Rays fall more obliquely on the first  refracting Surface, the Image soon became an Inch or two shorter. And  therefore in trying this Experiment, I was as curious as I could be in  placing the Prism by the above-mention'd Rule exactly in such a Posture,  that the Refractions of the Rays at their Emergence out of the Prism  might be equal to that at their Incidence on it. This Prism had some  Veins running along within the Glass from one end to the other, which  scattered some of the Sun's Light irregularly, but had no sensible  Effect in increasing the Length of the coloured Spectrum. For I tried  the same Experiment with other Prisms with the same Success. And  particularly with a Prism which seemed free from such Veins, and whose  refracting Angle was 62-1/2 Degrees, I found the Length of the Image  9-3/4 or 10 Inches at the distance of 18-1/2 Feet from the Prism, the  Breadth of the Hole in the Window-shut being 1/4 of an Inch, as before.  And because it is easy to commit a Mistake in placing the Prism in its  due Posture, I repeated the Experiment four or five Times, and always  found the Length of the Image that which is set down above. With another  Prism of clearer Glass and better Polish, which seemed free from Veins,  and whose refracting Angle was 63-1/2 Degrees, the Length of this Image  at the same distance of 18-1/2 Feet was also about 10 Inches, or 10-1/8.  Beyond these Measures for about a 1/4 or 1/3 of an Inch at either end of  the Spectrum the Light of the Clouds seemed to be a little tinged with  red and violet, but so very faintly, that I suspected that Tincture  might either wholly, or in great Measure arise from some Rays of the  Spectrum scattered irregularly by some Inequalities in the Substance and  Polish of the Glass, and therefore I did not include it in these  Measures. Now the different Magnitude of the hole in the Window-shut,  and different thickness of the Prism where the Rays passed through it,  and different inclinations of the Prism to the Horizon, made no sensible  changes in the length of the Image. Neither did the different matter of  the Prisms make any: for in a Vessel made of polished Plates of Glass  cemented together in the shape of a Prism and filled with Water, there  is the like Success of the Experiment according to the quantity of the  Refraction. It is farther to be observed, that the Rays went on in right  Lines from the Prism to the Image, and therefore at their very going out  of the Prism had all that Inclination to one another from which the  length of the Image proceeded, that is, the Inclination of more than two  degrees and an half. And yet according to the Laws of Opticks vulgarly  received, they could not possibly be so much inclined to one another.[D]  For let EG [_Fig._ 13. (p. 27)] represent the Window-shut, F the hole  made therein through which a beam of the Sun's Light was transmitted  into the darkened Chamber, and ABC a Triangular Imaginary Plane whereby  the Prism is feigned to be cut transversely through the middle of the  Light. Or if you please, let ABC represent the Prism it self, looking  directly towards the Spectator's Eye with its nearer end: And let XY be  the Sun, MN the Paper upon which the Solar Image or Spectrum is cast,  and PT the Image it self whose sides towards _v_ and _w_ are Rectilinear  and Parallel, and ends towards P and T Semicircular.

There you will find a more complete discussion of the animal's range,  size, and distinctive characteristics. In addition, you will find a  brief discussion distinguishing it from animals with which it is likely  to be confused in the field.           *       *       *       *       *    This guide will probably work best if, in advance of attempting to use  the key in the field, the reader will familiarize himself with the  general outline, with characters or behaviors to note, and with the  locations of the various species accounts. It will also help if he  schools himself to ask a series of questions about the animal(s) he sees  at the time of the encounter rather than depending on his recall at a  later time (see p. 160). As we have emphasized several times in this  guide, positive identification of cetaceans at sea can only occasionally  be made on the basis of a single characteristic. Therefore, the greater  the amount of pertinent evidence an observer obtains, the greater the  likelihood he can make a reliable identification.      To Identify Stranded Animals    Stranded animals can best be identified by referring to Appendix C and  its associated tables, making a preliminary determination and then  consulting the species accounts in the main body of the book for  verification of the identification. As noted in that appendix, if the  animal is recently stranded, identification can be made using any of the  externally visible characteristics described for the living species at  sea. But even if the animal is in an advanced stage of decomposition, it  can usually be identified by referring to the key and to the numbers and  descriptions of baleen plates, for all baleen whales, and the numbers  and relative lengths of ventral grooves, for all balaenopterine whales  (Table 1), or to the tables on the numbers and descriptions of teeth,  for toothed whales (Table 2).      To Record and Report Information    As discussed in the preface, though learning to identify the whales,  dolphins, and porpoises one sees may be exciting in itself, many persons  may want to participate in the accumulation of data on these interesting  animals by routinely reporting their observations to scientists who are  actively studying them and who can make immediate use of the  information. The following may help these persons:      Suggestions for making and recording observations of cetaceans at sea  and sample data forms are included in Appendix C. Similar suggestions  for taking and recording data on stranded cetaceans are included in  Appendix D. For both types of data, blank data forms located after the  appendices may be photocopied in bulk for use in the field.    Completed data forms and all associated information for sightings at sea  should be forwarded to the Platforms of Opportunity Program, National  Marine Fisheries Service, Tiburon, CA 94920, or to one of the authors of  this guide. From there, they will be made available to scientists  actively studying the cetaceans of a given species or geographical area.    Completed data forms and all associated information for observations of  stranded cetaceans should be forwarded to the Division of Mammals, U.S.  National Museum, Washington, DC 20560, to one of the authors of this  guide, or to one of the regional laboratories listed in Appendix E.  These persons have, in turn, been encouraged to keep a free flow of  information among them.    Table 1.
