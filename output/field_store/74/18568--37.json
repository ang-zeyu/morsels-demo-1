Another gloats over the number of Connecticut warblers--a rare  bird--he killed in one season in Massachusetts. Another tells how a  mocking-bird appeared in southern New England and was hunted down by  himself and friend, its eggs \"clutched,\" and the bird killed. Who knows  how much the bird lovers of New England lost by that foul deed? The  progeny of the birds would probably have returned to Connecticut to  breed, and their progeny, or a part of them, the same, till in time the  famous songster would have become a regular visitant to New England.  In the same journal still another collector describes minutely how he  outwitted three humming birds and captured their nests and eggs,--a  clutch he was very proud of. A Massachusetts bird harrier boasts of his  clutch of the egg's of that dainty little warbler, the blue yellow-back.  One season he took two sets, the next five sets, the next four sets,  besides some single eggs, and the next season four sets, and says he  might have found more had he had more time. One season he took, in  about twenty days, three from one tree. I have heard of a collector who  boasted of having taken one hundred sets of the eggs of the marsh wren,  in a single day; of another, who took in the same time, thirty nests  of the yellow-breasted chat; and of still another, who claimed to have  taken one thousand sets of eggs of different birds in one season. A  large business has grown up under the influence of this collecting  craze. One dealer in eggs has those of over five hundred species. He  says that his business in 1883 was twice that of 1882; in 1884 it was  twice that of 1883, and so on. Collectors vie with each other in the  extent and variety of their cabinets. They not only obtain eggs in sets,  but aim to have a number of sets of the same bird so as to show all  possible variations. I hear of a private collection that contains twelve  sets of kingbirds' eggs, eight sets of house-wrens' eggs, four sets  mocking-birds' eggs, etc.; sets of eggs taken in low trees, high trees,  medium trees; spotted sets, dark sets, plain sets, and light sets of the  same species of bird. Many collections are made on this latter plan.    Thus are our birds hunted and cut off and all in the name of science; as  if science had not long ago finished with these birds. She has weighed  and measured, and dissected, and described them, and their nests, and  eggs, and placed them in her cabinet; and the interest of science and  of humanity now demands that this wholesale nest-robbing cease. These  incidents I have given above, it is true, are but drops in the bucket,  but the bucket would be more than full if we could get all the facts.  Where one man publishes his notes, hundreds, perhaps thousands, say  nothing, but go as silently about their nest-robbing as weasels.    It is true that the student of ornithology often feels compelled to take  bird-life. It is not an easy matter to \"name all the birds without a  gun,\" though an opera-glass will often render identification entirely  certain, and leave the songster unharmed; but once having mastered the  birds, the true ornithologist leaves his gun at home. This view of the  case may not be agreeable to that desiccated mortal called the \"closet  naturalist,\" but for my own part the closet naturalist is a person with  whom I have very little sympathy. He is about the most wearisome and  profitless creature in existence. With his piles of skins, his cases of  eggs, his laborious feather-splitting, and his outlandish nomenclature,  he is not only the enemy of the birds but the enemy of all those who  would know them rightly.    Not the collectors alone are to blame for the diminishing numbers of our  wild birds, but a large share of the responsibility rests upon quite a  different class of persons, namely, the milliners. False taste in dress  is as destructive to our feathered friends as are false aims in science.  It is said that the traffic in the skins of our brighter plumaged  birds, arising from their use by the milliners, reaches to hundreds of  thousands annually. I am told of one middleman who collected from the  shooters in one district, in four months, seventy thousand skins. It  is a barbarous taste that craves this kind of ornamentation. Think of a  woman or girl of real refinement appearing upon the street with her head  gear adorned with the scalps of our songsters!    It is probably true that the number of our birds destroyed by man is but  a small percentage of the number cut off by their natural enemies; but  it is to be remembered that those he destroys are in addition to those  thus cut off, and that it is this extra or artificial destruction that  disturbs the balance of nature. The operation of natural causes keeps  the birds in check, but the greed of the collectors and milliners tends  to their extinction.    I can pardon a man who wishes to make a collection of eggs and birds  for his own private use, if he will content himself with one or two  specimens of a kind, though he will find any collection much less  satisfactory and less valuable than he imagines, but the professional  nest-robber and skin collector should be put down, either by legislation  or with dogs and shotguns.    I have remarked above that there is probably very little truth in  the popular notion that snakes can \"charm\" birds. But two of my  correspondents have each furnished me with an incident from his own  experience, which seems to confirm the popular belief. One of them  writes from Georgia as follows:--    \"Some twenty-eight years ago I was in Calaveras County, California,  engaged in cutting lumber. One day in coming out of the camp or cabin,  my attention was attracted to the curious action of a quail in the air,  which, instead of flying low and straight ahead as usual, was some fifty  feet high, flying in a circle, and uttering cries of distress. I watched  the bird and saw it gradually descend, and following with my eye in a  line from the bird to the ground saw a large snake with head erect and  some ten or twelve inches above the ground, and mouth wide open, and  as far as I could see, gazing intently on the quail (I was about thirty  feet from the snake). The quail gradually descended, its circles growing  smaller and smaller and all the time uttering cries of distress, until  its feet were within two or three inches of the mouth of the snake; when  I threw a stone, and though not hitting the snake, yet struck the ground  so near as to frighten him, and he gradually started off. The quail,  however, fell to the ground, apparently lifeless. I went forward and  picked it up and found it was thoroughly overcome with fright, its  little heart beating as if it would burst through the skin. After  holding it in my hand a few moments it flew away. I then tried to find  the snake, but could not. I am unable to say whether the snake was  venomous or belonged to the constricting family, like the black snake.  I can well recollect it was large and moved off rather slow. As I had  never seen anything of the kind before, it made a great impression on  my mind, and after the lapse of so long a time, the incident appears as  vivid to me as though it had occurred yesterday.\"    It is not probable that the snake had its mouth open; its darting tongue  may have given that impression.    The other incident comes to me from Vermont. \"While returning from  church in 1876,\" says the writer, \"as I was crossing a bridge... I  noticed a striped snake in the act of charming a song-sparrow. They were  both upon the sand beneath the bridge. The snake kept his head swaying  slowly from side to side, and darted his tongue out continually. The  bird, not over a foot away, was facing the snake, hopping from one foot  to the other, and uttering a dissatisfied little chirp. I watched them  till the snake seized the bird, having gradually drawn nearer. As he  seized it, I leaped over the side of the bridge; the snake glided away  and I took up the bird, which he had dropped. It was too frightened to  try to fly and I carried it nearly a mile before it flew from my open  hand.\"    If these observers are quite sure of what they saw, then undoubtedly  snakes have the power to draw birds within their grasp. I remember that  my mother told me that while gathering wild strawberries she had on one  occasion come upon a bird fluttering about the head of a snake as if  held there by a spell. On her appearance, the snake lowered its head and  made off, and the panting bird flew away. A neighbor of mine killed  a black snake which had swallowed a full-grown red squirrel, probably  captured by the same power of fascination.          THE TRAGEDIES OF THE NESTS      The life of the birds, especially of our migratory song-birds, is a  series of adventures and of hair-breadth escapes by flood and field.  Very few of them probably die a natural death, or even live out half  their appointed days. The home instinct is strong in birds as it is in  most creatures; and I am convinced that every spring a large number  of those which have survived the Southern campaign return to their old  haunts to breed. A Connecticut farmer took me out under his porch, one  April day, and showed me a phoebe bird's nest six stories high. The same  bird had no doubt returned year after year; and as there was room for  only one nest upon her favorite shelf, she had each season reared a new  superstructure upon the old as a foundation. I have heard of a white  robin--an albino--that nested several years in succession in the suburbs  of a Maryland city. A sparrow with a very marked peculiarity of song I  have heard several seasons in my own locality. But the birds do not all  live to return to their old haunts: the bobolinks and starlings run a  gauntlet of fire from the Hudson to the Savannah, and the robins and  meadow-larks and other song-birds are shot by boys and pot-hunters in  great numbers,--to say nothing of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31630"],[0,"Hand-Loom Weaving: A Manual for School and Home (#4)"],[1,"are brighter, and seem better able to grasp an idea. The slow  children are also stimulated, and in doing the simple work well are  preparing for that which is more difficult. Impression and expression  should go hand in hand. We know nothing of \"the bad boy,\" now that we  have found something for his restless fingers to do. \"The habit of  methodical work is the basis of all ethics.\" In teaching children to do  their best, we are training citizens. Some one has facetiously remarked  that, \"In the making of a good citizen it is necessary to catch your  citizen early.\" We cannot get hold of the anarchists, but we can get  hold of their children, and in the training of them to work lies their  salvation. Formation is better than reformation.    [Sidenote: _Formation, not reformation_]    [Sidenote: _New applications for old teachings_]    Verily, there is nothing new under the sun. We hie ourselves to the  summer schools, and return laden with new ideas--when lo! it dawns upon  us that all we have done during the hot days has been to make a new  application of what Froebel taught the world before we were born. So in  this introduction, an old story has been retold, but I hope that it will  come with a new meaning to my fellow teachers.          Chapter Three    FIRST STEPS IN WEAVING      [Sidenote: _Felt mats and slats_]    [Sidenote: _Demonstration cards and diagrams_]    The principles of weaving are very easily learned with felt mats and  slats. One-half a yard of felt two yards wide will make thirty-six mats  six inches square. These are very durable, and can be used year after  year, if protected from moth during the summer. Some prefer leather or  oil-cloth mats, backed with heavy unbleached muslin, but they are more  expensive, and not so pleasant to work with as the soft wool. The slats,  which should be at least one-half an inch wide, can be obtained at any  kindergarten supply store. Buy the uncolored slats and dye them  yourself. Dark green mats, woven with deep red slats, are pretty. The  slats are easier to handle if they are soaked and cut the required  length before dyeing. When the six-inch mats are cut, allow a  three-quarter-inch margin on all sides. Measure the mat for  one-half-inch strips, of which there will be nine, and mark by snapping  a chalked string upon the mat. Double it with chalked lines outside and  commence to cut from the center; then open and finish cutting to the  margin. It would be better for very little children if the strips and  slats could be one inch wide. In this case the mats would, of course, be  larger, and it might be necessary to have the slats made to order. The  slats should be kept in little bundles containing the required number,  and secured by rubber bands. If one could have plenty of time and  material it would be a good plan to have several sets of mats of  different sizes, so that the children would not always be confined to  one number and its combinations in a certain set of patterns--in this  case, nine--but have the pleasure which comes from variety.  Demonstration cards and diagrams for weaving can be obtained at the  kindergarten and school-supply stores. An illustration of an excellent  demonstration frame can be seen in the \"Kindergarten Guide,\" by Lois  Bates. Sample mats can be woven by the older children from the designs  in any of the \"Guides,\" and given to the smaller children to copy.    [Sidenote: _Purpose of practice mats_]    [Sidenote: _Do not deceive the child_]    When the purpose of these practice mats is understood there can be no  objection to them on the ground that the work is destroyed by pulling  out the slats each time. It is not an unusual thing to see in schools,  and even in kindergartens, faithful and conscientious teachers remaining  after hours to pull out the slats, on the principle, perhaps, that what  the children do not see will not affect their development, and the  innocent little bundles are given out again on the morrow, only to  undergo the same experience at night. One wonders sometimes if this is  possibly within the definition of deception. \"We mount to the summit,  round by round,\" and when the children understand that in doing the work  with the slats well, they are only learning _how_, and that each  successful attempt brings the delightful day nearer when they may have a  loom to work upon, they are perfectly satisfied.    [Sidenote: _Long slat weaving_]    When the children have learned to weave the small mats, further practice  can be had by weaving long slats into a warp of cord on the loom. It is  better to conquer the mystery of \"over and under\" in this way than to  undo the work and wear out the material after making a mistake.    [Sidenote: _Paper mats_]    Many teachers prefer to make the practice mats of paper because they are  cheaper. Heavy paper, in desirable colors, can be obtained at the  wholesale paper houses, and for a small sum can be cut in squares of any  required size. Mats can be made more durable by pasting them on heavy  muslin before cutting. In many schools children in grades above the  entering room prepare their own mats by measuring with tablets or rulers  and then drawing and cutting on the lines. When they have learned to do  them well, let each child make one for the entering room. Nothing  strengthens the community feeling so much in a school as to encourage  the older pupils to help the younger.    [Sidenote: _Mat weaving in the kindergarten_]    The mat-weaving, as it is done in the kindergarten, is very beautiful  and fascinating work. The mats can be obtained in any size and any width  of strips at the supply stores. The weaving is done with a long steel  needle which has a spring at one end to hold the strip. After  preliminary work with the felt mats and slats the children find  themselves able to weave quite independently, particularly if  demonstration cards or sample mats are placed before the class. An  infinite variety of patterns, which later will be useful in  wool-weaving, can be found in the \"Kindergarten Guides.\" In weaving  patterns having a center, it is better to weave two strips at once,  pushing one to the top and one to the bottom of the mat. The old numbers  of the Godey and Peterson magazines have patterns for Berlin wool and  bead work which can be used for the paper mats with good effect. Mrs.  Kate Douglas Wiggin (Mrs. Riggs) has some good suggestions for invention  in weaving, in her \"Republic of Childhood\" (Occupations). The value of  weaving in number work is also admirably set forth in this book.    [Sidenote: _Gifts_]    At Christmas time many charming little gifts can be made of these mats.  Sachet cases made of a six or eight inch square, with four corners  folded to the center, are attractive. Inclose a square of wadding, in  which a pinch of heliotrope or white rose perfume powder has been  hidden, and fasten the corners together with a scrap picture of old  Santa Claus.    Slat work is useful in learning the fundamental principles of weaving,  although this work is more closely related to basket than to rug  weaving. It is an excellent preparation for the free-paper weaving, and  is also a step toward basket work.    [Sidenote: _Interlacing slats_]    In interlacing slats the mystery of \"over and under\" is solved and the  dependence of one slat upon another in making a perfect whole is shown  in a forcible way, particularly when the form falls to pieces in the  attempt to lift it from the table. Edward Wiebe says in his \"Paradise  of Childhood\": \"It was the _one_ slat which, owing to its dereliction in  performing its duty, destroyed the figure and prevented all the other  slats from performing theirs.\" One experience of this kind will teach  more than a thousand precepts. The geometrical forms learned in the  sense-training lessons can be reproduced with the slats and will thus be  impressed upon the mind during the period of busy work at the desk. A  series of beautiful designs is published by E. Steiger, New York. Many  designs may be grouped for decoration, and single symmetrical figures  can be mounted upon heavy paper.    [Sidenote: _Free-paper weaving_]    [Sidenote: _Sequence_]    Free-paper weaving requires quite a little skill of hand and a great  deal of patience before the child can achieve a successful result.  Perhaps a few words regarding it, and information about a simple  sequence of paper patterns, will not be out of place, since so many are  to-day taking it up. Strips of manilla paper forty inches long and one  inch wide are used. These are cut into strips eight inches, sixteen  inches, twenty inches, and twenty-four inches in length. For the first  pattern of the sequence take four strips eight inches long and double  each one. Hold two of them side by side in the left hand, so that the  open ends of the outer strip are at the top while those of the other are  at the bottom. With the right hand inclose the first strip in the left  hand with one of the remaining double strips and pass the ends of the  latter between the two ends of the second strip. Then hold the work in  the right hand and proceed in the same way with the left hand. When both  strips are in, draw them tight and they will be firmly woven. The ends  can be cut in any way desired. These little forms can be used for  bookmarks. They are very attractive when made in two tones of one color.    [Illustration: _Sequence in paper weaving_]    [Sidenote: _Sequence weaving_]    The second pattern of the sequence is made with sixteen-inch strips.  The first part is woven like the bookmark. Four double strips now  project from the square. Begin at the bottom and fold back the _upper_  one of each of these double strips. As you do this you will find that  you are weaving another square on top of the first one. To secure the  last strip pass it under the square next to it and pull it through. You  will now have eight single strips, two on each side. To form"]]]
