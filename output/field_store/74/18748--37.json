Come!\"    He turned and walked down the street, and after a moment's hesitation  Dorothy caught Eureka in her arms and climbed into the buggy.  The boy  took his seat beside her and said: \"Gid-dap Jim.\"    As the horse ambled along, drawing the buggy, the people of the glass  city made way for them and formed a procession in their rear.  Slowly  they moved down one street and up another, turning first this way and  then that, until they came to an open square in the center of which was  a big glass palace having a central dome and four tall spires on each  corner.          3.  The Arrival Of The Wizard      The doorway of the glass palace was quite big enough for the horse and  buggy to enter, so Zeb drove straight through it and the children found  themselves in a lofty hall that was very beautiful.  The people at once  followed and formed a circle around the sides of the spacious room,  leaving the horse and buggy and the man with the star to occupy the  center of the hall.    \"Come to us, oh, Gwig!\" called the man, in a loud voice.    Instantly a cloud of smoke appeared and rolled over the floor; then it  slowly spread and ascended into the dome, disclosing a strange  personage seated upon a glass throne just before Jim's nose.  He was  formed just as were the other inhabitants of this land and his clothing  only differed from theirs in being bright yellow.  But he had no hair  at all, and all over his bald head and face and upon the backs of his  hands grew sharp thorns like those found on the branches of  rose-bushes.  There was even a thorn upon the tip of his nose and he  looked so funny that Dorothy laughed when she saw him.    The Sorcerer, hearing the laugh, looked toward the little girl with  cold, cruel eyes, and his glance made her grow sober in an instant.    \"Why have you dared to intrude your unwelcome persons into the secluded  Land of the Mangaboos?\" he asked, sternly.    \"'Cause we couldn't help it,\" said Dorothy.    \"Why did you wickedly and viciously send the Rain of Stones to crack  and break our houses?\" he continued.    \"We didn't,\" declared the girl.    \"Prove it!\" cried the Sorcerer.    \"We don't have to prove it,\" answered Dorothy, indignantly.  \"If you  had any sense at all you'd known it was the earthquake.\"    \"We only know that yesterday came a Rain of Stones upon us, which did  much damage and injured some of our people.  Today came another Rain of  Stones, and soon after it you appeared among us.\"    \"By the way,\" said the man with the star, looking steadily at the  Sorcerer, \"you told us yesterday that there would not be a second Rain  of Stones.  Yet one has just occurred that was even worse than the  first.  What is your sorcery good for if it cannot tell us the truth?\"    \"My sorcery does tell the truth!\" declared the thorn-covered man.  \"I  said there would be but one Rain of Stones.  This second one was a Rain  of People-and-Horse-and-Buggy.  And some stones came with them.\"    \"Will there be any more Rains?\" asked the man with the star.    \"No, my Prince.\"    \"Neither stones nor people?\"    \"No, my Prince.\"    \"Are you sure?\"    \"Quite sure, my Prince.  My sorcery tells me so.\"    Just then a man came running into the hall and addressed the Prince  after making a low bow.    \"More wonders in the air, my Lord,\" said he.    Immediately the Prince and all of his people flocked out of the hall  into the street, that they might see what was about to happen.  Dorothy  and Zeb jumped out of the buggy and ran after them, but the Sorcerer  remained calmly in his throne.    Far up in the air was an object that looked like a balloon.  It was not  so high as the glowing star of the six colored suns, but was descending  slowly through the air--so slowly that at first it scarcely seemed to  move.    The throng stood still and waited.  It was all they could do, for to go  away and leave that strange sight was impossible; nor could they hurry  its fall in any way.  The earth children were not noticed, being so  near the average size of the Mangaboos, and the horse had remained in  the House of the Sorcerer, with Eureka curled up asleep on the seat of  the buggy.    Gradually the balloon grew bigger, which was proof that it was settling  down upon the Land of the Mangaboos.  Dorothy was surprised to find how  patient the people were, for her own little heart was beating rapidly  with excitement.  A balloon meant to her some other arrival from the  surface of the earth, and she hoped it would be some one able to assist  her and Zeb out of their difficulties.    In an hour the balloon had come near enough for her to see a basket  suspended below it; in two hours she could see a head looking over the  side of the basket; in three hours the big balloon settled slowly into  the great square in which they stood and came to rest on the glass  pavement.    Then a little man jumped out of the basket, took off his tall hat, and  bowed very gracefully to the crowd of Mangaboos around him.  He was  quite an old little man and his head was long and entirely bald.    \"Why,\" cried Dorothy, in amazement, \"it's Oz!\"    The little man looked toward her and seemed as much surprised as she  was.  But he smiled and bowed as he answered:    \"Yes, my dear; I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.  Eh?  And you are  little Dorothy, from Kansas.  I remember you very well.\"    \"Who did you say it was?\" whispered Zeb to the girl.    \"It's the wonderful Wizard of Oz.  Haven't you heard of him?\"    Just then the man with the star came and stood before the Wizard.    \"Sir,\" said he, \"why are you here, in the Land of the Mangaboos?\"    \"Didn't know what land it was, my son,\" returned the other, with a  pleasant smile; \"and, to be honest, I didn't mean to visit you when I  started out.  I live on top of the earth, your honor, which is far  better than living inside it; but yesterday I went up in a balloon, and  when I came down I fell into a big crack in the earth, caused by an  earthquake.  I had let so much gas out of my balloon that I could not  rise again, and in a few minutes the earth closed over my head.  So I  continued to descend until I reached this place, and if you will show  me a way to get out of it, I'll go with pleasure.  Sorry to have  troubled you; but it couldn't be helped.\"    The Prince had listened with attention.  Said he:    \"This child, who is from the crust of the earth, like yourself, called  you a Wizard.  Is not a Wizard something like a Sorcerer?\"    \"It's better,\" replied Oz, promptly.  \"One Wizard is worth three  Sorcerers.\"    \"Ah, you shall prove that,\" said the Prince.  \"We Mangaboos have, at  the present time, one of the most wonderful Sorcerers that ever was  picked from a bush; but he sometimes makes mistakes.  Do you ever make  mistakes?\"    \"Never!\" declared the Wizard, boldly.    \"Oh, Oz!\" said Dorothy; \"you made a lot of mistakes when you were in  the marvelous Land of Oz.\"    \"Nonsense!\" said the little man, turning red--although just then a ray  of violet sunlight was on his round face.    \"Come with me,\" said the Prince to him.  \"I wish to meet our Sorcerer.\"    The Wizard did not like this invitation, but he could not refuse to  accept it.  So he followed the Prince into the great domed hall, and  Dorothy and Zeb came after them, while the throng of people trooped in  also.    There sat the thorny Sorcerer in his chair of state, and when the  Wizard saw him he began to laugh, uttering comical little chuckles.    \"What an absurd creature!\" he exclaimed.    \"He may look absurd,\" said the Prince, in his quiet voice; \"but he is  an excellent Sorcerer.  The only fault I find with him is that he is so  often wrong.\"    \"I am never wrong,\" answered the Sorcerer.    \"Only a short time ago you told me there would be no more Rain of  Stones or of People,\" said the Prince.    \"Well, what then?\"    \"Here is another person descended from the air to prove you were wrong.\"    \"One person cannot be called 'people,'\" said the Sorcerer.  \"If two  should come out of the sky you might with justice say I was wrong; but  unless more than this one appears I will hold that I was right.\"    \"Very clever,\" said the Wizard, nodding his head as if pleased.  \"I am  delighted to find humbugs inside the earth, just the same as on top of  it.  Were you ever with a circus, brother?\"    \"No,\" said the Sorcerer.    \"You ought to join one,\" declared the little man seriously.  \"I belong  to Bailum & Barney's Great Consolidated Shows--three rings in one tent  and a menagerie on the side.  It's a fine aggregation, I assure you.\"    \"What do you do?\" asked the Sorcerer.    \"I go up in a balloon, usually, to draw the crowds to the circus.  But  I've just had the bad luck to come out of the sky, skip the solid  earth, and land lower down than I intended.  But never mind.  It isn't  everybody who gets a chance to see your Land of the Gabazoos.\"    \"Mangaboos,\" said the Sorcerer, correcting him.  \"If you are a Wizard  you ought to be able to call people by their right names.\"    \"Oh, I'm a Wizard; you may be sure of that.  Just as good a Wizard as  you are a Sorcerer.\"    \"That remains to be seen,\" said the other.    \"If you are able to prove that you are better,\" said the Prince to the  little man, \"I will make you the Chief Wizard of this domain.  Otherwise--\"    \"What will happen otherwise?\" asked the Wizard.    \"I will stop you from living and forbid you to be planted,\" returned  the Prince.    \"That does not sound especially pleasant,\" said the little man, looking  at the one with the star uneasily.  \"But never mind.  I'll beat Old  Prickly, all right.\"    \"My name is Gwig,\" said the Sorcerer, turning his heartless, cruel eyes  upon his rival.  \"Let me see you equal the sorcery I am about to  perform.\"    He waved a thorny hand and at once the tinkling of bells was heard,  playing sweet music.  Yet, look where she would, Dorothy could"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4204"],[0,"The Elements of Geology (#4)"],[1,"and tear loose from them, so that finally the rock disintegrates  into sand.    The conditions for the destructive action of heat and cold are  most fully met in arid regions when vegetation is wanting for lack  of sufficient rain. The soil not being held together by the roots  of plants is blown away over large areas, leaving the rocks bare  to the blazing sun in a cloudless sky. The air is dry, and the  heat received by the earth by day is therefore rapidly radiated at  night into space. There is a sharp and sudden fall of temperature  after sunset, and the rocks, strongly heated by day, are now  chilled perhaps even to the freezing point.    In the Sahara the thermometer has been known to fall 131 degrees  F. within a few hours. In the light air of the Pamir plateau in  central Asia a rise of 90 degrees F. has been recorded from seven  o'clock in the morning to one o'clock in the afternoon. On the  mountains of southwestern Texas there are frequently heard  crackling noises as the rocks of that arid region throw off scales  from a fraction of an inch to four inches in thickness, and loud  reports are made as huge bowlders split apart. Desert pebbles  weakened by long exposure to heat and cold have been shivered to  fine sharp-pointed fragments on being placed in sand heated to 180  degrees F. Beds half a foot thick, forming the floor of limestone  quarries in Wisconsin, have been known to buckle and arch and  break to fragments under the heat of the summer sun.    FROST. By this term is meant the freezing and thawing of water  contained in the pores and crevices of rocks. All rocks are more  or less porous and all contain more or less water in their pores.  Workers in stone call this \"quarry water,\" and speak of a stone as  \"green\" before the quarry water has dried out. Water also seeps  along joints and bedding planes and gathers in all seams and  crevices. Water expands in freezing, ten cubic inches of water  freezing to about eleven cubic inches of ice. As water freezes in  the rifts and pores of rocks it expands with the irresistible  force illustrated in the freezing and breaking of water pipes in  winter. The first rift in the rock, perhaps too narrow to be seen,  is widened little by little by the wedges of successive frosts,  and finally the rock is broken into detached blocks, and these  into angular chip-stone by the same process.    It is on mountain tops and in high latitudes that the effects of  frost are most plainly seen. \"Every summit\" says Whymper, \"amongst  the rock summits upon which I have stood has been nothing but a  piled-up heap of fragments\" (Fig. 7). In Iceland, in Spitsbergen,  in Kamchatka, and in other frigid lands large areas are thickly  strewn with sharp-edged fragments into which the rock has been  shattered by frost.    ORGANIC AGENTS    We must reckon the roots of plants and trees among the agents  which break rocks into pieces. The tiny rootlet in its search for  food and moisture inserts itself into some minute rift, and as it  grows slowly wedges the rock apart. Moreover, the acids of the  root corrode the rocks with which they are in contact. One may  sometimes find in the soil a block of limestone wrapped in a mesh  of roots, each of which lies in a little furrow where it has eaten  into the stone.    Rootless plants called lichens often cover and corrode rocks as  yet bare of soil; but where lichens are destroying the rock less  rapidly than does the weather, they serve in a way as a  protection.    CONDITIONS FAVORING DISINTEGRATION AND DECAY. The  disintegration of rocks under frost and temperature changes  goes on most rapidly in cold and arid climates, and where  vegetation is scant or absent. On the contrary, the decay of rocks  under the chemical action of water is favored by a warm, moist  climate and abundant vegetation. Frost and heat and cold can only  act within the few feet from the surface to which the necessary  temperature changes are limited, while water penetrates and alters  the rocks to great depths.    The pupil may explain.    In what ways the presence of joints and bedding planes assists in  the breaking up and decay of rocks under the action of the  weather.    Why it is a good rule of stone masons never to lay stones on edge,  but always on their natural bedding planes.    Why stones fresh from the quarry sometimes go to pieces in early  winter, when stones which have been quarried for some months  remain uninjured.    Why quarrymen in the northern states often keep their quarry  floors flooded during winter.    Why laminated limestone should not be used for curbstone.    Why rocks composed of layers differing in fineness of grain and in  ratios of expansion do not make good building stone.    Fine-grained rocks with pores so small that capillary attraction  keeps the water which they contain from readily draining away are  more apt to hold their pores ten elevenths full of water than are  rocks whose pores are larger. Which, therefore, are more likely to  be injured by frost?    Which is subject to greater temperature changes, a dark rock or  one of a light color? the north side or the south side of a  valley?    THE MANTLE OF ROCK WASTE    We have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away. They  are broken in pieces by frost, by tree roots, and by heat and  cold. They dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of  water and the various corrosive substances which it contains,  leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon  the surface. As a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of  rock waste which covers the land. It is well to imagine how the  country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation  all scraped away or had it never been formed. The surface of the  land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry  floor.    THE THICKNESS OF THE MANTLE. In any locality the thickness of the  mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is  constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming. On  the face of cliffs it is absent, for here waste is removed as fast  as it is made. Where waste is carried away more slowly than it is  produced, it accumulates in time to great depth.    The granite of Pikes Peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty  feet. In the city of Washington granite rock is so softened to a  depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel.  About Atlanta, Georgia, the rocks are completely rotted for one  hundred feet from the surface, while the beginnings of decay may  be noticed at thrice that depth. In places in southern Brazil the  rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet.    In southwestern Wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average  depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands, where it has been removed  to the least extent. The country rock on which it rests is a  limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities. At  least how thick, then, was that portion of the limestone which has  rotted down to the clay?    DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS OF RESIDUAL WASTE. We must learn to  distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather  from the products of other geological agencies. Residual waste is  unstratified. It contains no substances which have not been  derived from the weathering of the parent rock. There is a gradual  transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath.  Waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not  formed in place.    In certain regions of southern Missouri the land is covered with a  layer of broken flints and red clay, while the country rock is  limestone. The limestone contains nodules of flint, and we may  infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of  limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left  upon the surface. Flint is a form of quartz, dull-lustered,  usually gray or blackish in color, and opaque except on thinnest  edges, where it is translucent.    Over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified  stony clay called the drift. It often rests on sound rocks. It  contains grains of sand, pebbles, and bowlders composed of many  different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish.  Hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock  of the region. A shale or limestone, for example, cannot waste to  a clay containing granite pebbles. The origin of the drift will be  explained in subsequent chapters.    The differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to  their insoluble constituents. The latter are few in number and are  much the same in rocks of widely different nature, being chiefly  quartz, silicate of alumina, and iron oxide. By the removal of  their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down  to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red  or yellow with iron oxide.    In a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are  an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at  the earth's surface,--an environment different from that in which  they were formed under sea or under ground. In open air, where  they are attacked by various destructive agents, few of the rock-  making minerals are stable compounds except quartz, the iron  oxides, and the silicate of alumina; and so it is to one or more  of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are  reduced by long decay.    Which produces a mantle of finer waste, frost or chemical decay?  which a thicker mantle? In what respects would you expect that the  mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like India, in  frozen countries like Alaska, and in deserts such as the Sahara?    THE SOIL. The same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are  continually at work upon it, breaking it up into finer and finer  particles and causing its more complete decay.
