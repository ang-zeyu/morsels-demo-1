The crest diverges around the foramen, reunites  immediately behind it, and continues posteriorly to its junction with  the supraoccipital crest (Estes, 1961).    In _Didelphis_ the sagittal crest is high and dorsally convex in  lateral aspect, arising posterior to and medial to the orbits, reaching  its greatest height near the midpoint, and sloping down to its  termination at the supraoccipital crest. Two low ridges extend  posteriorly from the postorbital process to the anterior end of the  sagittal crest and correspond to ridges in similar position in  _Thrinaxodon_.    The supraoccipital crest flares upward to a considerable extent in  _Thrinaxodon_ and slopes posteriorly from the skull-roof proper. The  crest extends on either side downward to its confluence with the  zygomatic bar. The area of the crest that is associated with the  temporal musculature is similarly shaped in _Didelphis_.    The zygomatic bar in each genus is stout, laterally compressed, and  dorsally convex on both upper and lower margins. At the back of the  orbit of _Thrinaxodon_, the postorbital process of the jugal extends  posterodorsally. At this position in _Didelphis_, there is but a minor  upward curvature of the margin of the bar.    In _Thrinaxodon_ the dorsal and ventral postorbital processes, arising  from the postorbital and jugal bones respectively, nearly meet but  remain separate. The orbit is not completely walled off from the  adductor chamber. The corresponding processes in _Didelphis_ are  rudimentary so that the confluence of the orbit and the adductor  chamber is complete.    The adductor chamber dorsally occupies slightly less than half of the  total length of the skull of _Thrinaxodon_; in _Didelphis_ the dorsal  length of the chamber is approximately half of the total length of the  skull.    [Illustration: FIG. 7. _Thrinaxodon._ Showing masseter and temporal  muscles. Skull after Romer (1956). Approx. x 7/10.]    The coronoid process in _Thrinaxodon_ sweeps upward posterodorsally at  an angle oblique to the long axis of the ramus. Angular, surangular and  articular bones extend backward beneath and medial to the process. The  process extends above the most dorsal point of the zygomatic bar, as in  _Didelphis_. The mandibular ramus is ventrally convex in both genera.    The relationships described above suggest that _Thrinaxodon_ and the  therapsids having similar morphology in the posterior region of the  skull possessed a temporal adductor mass that was split into major  medial and lateral components (Fig. 7). The more lateral of these, the  masseter, arose from the inner surface and lower margin of the  zygomatic bar and inserted on the lateral surface of the coronoid  process.    The medial division or temporal arose from the sagittal crest and  supraoccipital crest and the intervening dermal roof. The muscle  inserted on the inner and outer surfaces of the coronoid process and  possibly on the bones beneath.    _Thrinaxodon_ represents an advance beyond _Dimetrodon_ in several  respects. The zygomatic bar in _Thrinaxodon_ extends relatively far  forward, is bowed outward and dorsally arched. Consequently, the  masseter was able to extend from an anterodorsal origin to a posterior  and ventral insertion. The curvature of the jaw transforms the  anterodorsal pull of the muscle into a dorsally directed adductive  movement regardless of the initial angle of the jaw. This is the  generalized mammalian condition.    With the development of the secondary palate the area previously  available for the origin of large anterior pterygoid muscles was  reduced. The development of the masseter extending posteroventrally  from an anterior origin presumably paralleled the reduction of the  anterior pterygoids. The therapsid masseter, as an external muscle  unhindered by the crowding of surrounding organs, was readily available  for the many modifications that have been achieved among the mammals.    In the course of synapsid evolution leading to mammals, the temporal  presumably became the main muscle mass acting in adduction of the lower  jaw. Its primacy is reflected in the phyletic expansion of the temporal  openings to permit greater freedom of the muscles during contraction.  In the synapsids that lead to mammals, there is no similar change in  the region of the palate that can be ascribed to the effect of the  pterygoid musculature, even though these adductors, like the temporal,  primitively were subjected to severe limitations of space.      Didelphis    Dissections reveal the following relationships of the external  adductors of the jaw in _Didelphis marsupialis_ (Fig. 8).         1. MASSETER         Origin: ventral surface of zygomatic arch.         Insertion: posteroventral and lateroventral surface of       mandible.         2. EXTERNAL TEMPORALIS Origin: sagittal crest; anteriorly       with internal temporalis from frontal bone; posteriorly with       internal temporalis from interparietal bone.         Insertion: lateral surface of coronoid process of mandible.         3. INTERNAL TEMPORALIS         Origin: sagittal crest and skull roof, including posterior       two-thirds of frontal bone, whole of parietal, and       dorsalmost portions of squamosal and alisphenoid.         Insertion: medial surface of coronoid process; dorsal edge       of coronoid process.    [Illustration: FIG. 8. _Didelphis marsupialis._ Showing masseter and  temporal muscles. Skull KU 3780, 1 mi. N Lawrence, Douglas Co., Kansas.  x 3/5.]      Temporal Openings    In discussions of the morphology and functions of the adductor  mechanism of the lower jaw, the problem of accounting for the  appearance of temporal openings in the skull is often encountered. Two  patterns of explanation have evolved. The first has been the attempt to  ascribe to the constant action of the same selective force the openings  from their inception in primitive members of a phyletic line to their  fullest expression in terminal members. According to this theory, for  example, the synapsid opening appeared _originally_ to allow freer  expansion of the adductor muscles of the jaw during contraction, and  continued selection for that character caused the openings to expand  until the ultimately derived therapsid or mammalian condition was  achieved.    The second course has been the attempt to explain the appearance of  temporal openings in whatever line in which they occurred by the action  of the same constant selective force. According to the reasoning of  this theory, temporal fenestration in all groups was due to the need  to decrease the total weight of the skull, and selection in all those  groups where temporal fenestration occurs was to further that end.    Both of these routes of inquiry are inadequate. If modern views of  selection are applied to the problem of explaining the appearance of  temporal fenestrae, the possibility cannot be ignored that:         1. Selective pressures causing the inception of temporal       fenestrae differed from those causing the continued       expansion of the fenestrae.         2. The selective pressures both for the inception and       continued expansion of the fenestrae differed from group to       group.         3. Selection perhaps involved multiple pressures operating       concurrently.         4. Because of different genotypes the potential of the       temporal region to respond to selective demands varied from       group to group.    [Illustration: FIG. 9. _Captorhinus._ Diagram, showing some  hypothetical lines of stress. Approx. x 1.]    [Illustration: FIG. 10. _Captorhinus._ Diagram, showing areas of  internal thickening. Approx. x 1.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11. _Captorhinus._ Diagram, showing orientation of  sculpture. Approx. x 1.]    Secondly, the vectors of mechanical force associated with the temporal  region are complex (Fig. 9). Presumably it was toward a more efficient  mechanism to withstand these that selection on the cheek region was  operating. The simpler and more readily analyzed of these forces are:         1. The force exerted by the weight of the skull anterior to       the cheek and the distribution of that weight depending       upon, for example, the length of the snout in relation to       its width, and the density of the bone.         2. The weight of the jaw pulling down on the suspensorium       when the jaw is at rest and the compression against the       suspensorium when the jaw is adducted; the distribution of       these stresses depending upon the length and breadth of the       snout, the rigidity of the anterior symphysis, and the       extent of the quadrate-articular joint.         3. The magnitude and extent of the vectors of force       transmitted through the occiput from the articulation with       the vertebral column and from the pull of the axial       musculature.         4. The downward pull on the skull-roof by the adductor       muscles of the mandible.         5. The lateral push exerted against the cheek by the       expansion of the mandibular adductors during contraction.         6. The necessity to compensate for the weakness in the skull       caused by the orbits, particularly in those kinds of       primitive tetrapods in which the orbits are large.    The distribution of these stresses is further complicated and modified  by such factors as:         1. The completeness or incompleteness of the occiput and the       location and extent of its attachment to the dermal roof.         2. The size and rigidity of the braincase and palate, and       the extent and rigidity of their contact with the skull.    The stresses applied to the cheek fall into two groups. The first  includes all of those stresses that ran through and parallel to the  plane of the cheek initially. The weight of the jaw and snout, the pull  of the axial musculature, and the necessity to provide firm anchorage  for the teeth created stresses that acted in this manner. The second  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3034"],[0,"The Anti-Slavery Crusade: A Chronicle of the Gathering Storm (#4)"],[1,"of the negro leaders with the highest qualities of statesmanship and  self-sacrificing generosity; and Wendell Phillips, in an impassioned  address which he delivered in 1861, placed on the honor roll above the  chief worthies of history--including Cromwell and Washington--Toussaint  L'Ouverture, the liberator of Hayti, whom France had betrayed and  murdered.    Abolitionists found support for their position in the contention that  other communities had abolished slavery without such accompanying  horrors as occurred in Hayti and without serious race conflict. Slavery  had run its course in Spanish America, and emancipation accompanied or  followed the formation of independent republics. In 1833 all slaves  in the British Empire were liberated, including those in the important  island of Jamaica. So it happened that, just at the time when Southern  leaders were making up their minds to defend their peculiar institution  at all hazards, they were beset on every side by the spirit of  emancipation. Abolitionists, on the other hand, were fully convinced  that the attainment of some form of emancipation in the United States  was certain, and that, either peaceably or through violence, the slaves  would ultimately be liberated.        CHAPTER III. EARLY CRUSADERS    At the time when the new cotton industry was enhancing the value of  slave labor, there arose from the ranks of the people those who freely  consecrated their all to the freeing of the slave. Among these, Benjamin  Lundy, a New Jersey Quaker, holds a significant place.    Though the Society of Friends fills a large place in the anti-slavery  movement, its contribution to the growth of the conception of equality  is even more significant. This impetus to the idea arises from a  fundamental Quaker doctrine, announced at the middle of the seventeenth  century, to the erect that God reveals Himself to mankind, not through  any priesthood or specially chosen agents; not through any ordinance,  form, or ceremony; not through any church or institution; not through  any book or written record of any sort; but directly, through His  Spirit, to each person. This direct enlightening agency they deemed  coextensive with humanity; no race and no individual is left without the  ever-present illuminating Spirit. If men of old spoke as they were moved  by the Holy Spirit, what they spoke or wrote can furnish no reliable  guidance to the men of a later generation, except as their minds also  are enlightened by the same Spirit in the same way. \"The letter killeth;  it is the Spirit that giveth life.\"    This doctrine in its purity and simplicity places all men and all races  on an equality; all are alike ignorant and imperfect; all are alike in  their need of the more perfect revelation yet to be made. Master and  slave are equal before God; there can be no such relation, therefore,  except by doing violence to a personality, to a spiritual being. In  harmony with this fundamental principle, the Society of Friends early  rid itself of all connection with slavery. The Friends' Meeting became  a refuge for those who were moved by the Spirit to testify against  slavery.    Born in 1789 in a State which was then undergoing the process of  emancipating its slaves, Benjamin Lundy moved at the age of nineteen  to Wheeling, West Virginia, which had already become the center of an  active domestic slave-trade. The pious young Quaker, now apprenticed to  a saddler, was brought into personal contact with this traffic in human  flesh. He felt keenly the national disgrace of the iniquity. So deep did  the iron enter into his soul that never again did he find peace of mind  except in efforts to relieve the oppressed. Like hundreds and thousands  of others, Lundy was led on to active opposition to the trade by an  actual knowledge of the inhumanity of the business as prosecuted before  his eyes and by his sympathy for human suffering.    His apprenticeship ended, Lundy was soon established in a prosperous  business in an Ohio village not far from Wheeling. Though he now lived  in a free State, the call of the oppressed was ever in his ears and he  could not rest. He drew together a few of his neighbors, and together  they organized the Union Humane Society, whose object was the relief  of those held in bondage. In a few months the society numbered several  hundred members, and Lundy issued an address to the philanthropists  of the whole country, urging them to unite in like manner with uniform  constitutions, and suggesting that societies so formed adopt a policy of  correspondence and cooperation. At about the same time, Lundy began to  publish anti-slavery articles in the Mount Pleasant Philanthropist and  other papers.    In 1819 he went on a business errand to St. Louis, Missouri, where he  found himself in the midst of an agitation over the question of the  extension of slavery in the States. With great zest he threw himself  into the discussion, making use of the newspapers in Missouri and  Illinois. Having lost his property, he returned poverty-stricken  to Ohio, where he founded in January, 1821, the Genius of Universal  Emancipation. A few months later he transferred his paper to the more  congenial atmosphere of Jonesborough, Tennessee, but in 1824 he went to  Baltimore, Maryland. In the meantime, Lundy had become much occupied in  traveling, lecturing, and organizing societies for the promotion of the  cause of abolition. He states that during the ten years previous to 1830  he had traveled upwards of twenty-five thousand miles, five thousand  of which were on foot. He now became interested in plans for colonizing  negroes in other countries as an aid to emancipation, though he  himself had no confidence in the colonization society and its scheme of  deportation to Africa. After leading a few negroes to Hayti in 1829, he  visited Canada, Texas, and Mexico with a similar plan in view.    During a trip through the Middle States and New England in 1828, Lundy  met William Lloyd Garrison, and the following year he walked all the  way from Baltimore to Bennington, Vermont, for the express purpose of  securing the assistance of the youthful reformer as coeditor of his  paper. Garrison had previously favored colonization, but within the few  weeks which elapsed before he joined Lundy, he repudiated all forms of  colonization and advocated immediate and unconditional emancipation. He  at once told Lundy of his change of views. \"Well,\" said Lundy, \"thee may  put thy initials to thy articles, and I will put my witness to mine,  and each will bear his own burden.\" The two editors were, however,  in complete accord in their opposition to the slave-trade. Lundy had  suffered a dangerous assault at the hands of a Baltimore slave-trader  before he was joined by Garrison. During the year 1830, Garrison was  convicted of libel and thrown into prison on account of his scathing  denunciation of Francis Todd of Massachusetts, the owner of a vessel  engaged in the slave-trade.    These events brought to a crisis the publication of the Genius of  Universal Emancipation. The editors now parted company. Again Lundy  moved the office of the paper, this time to Washington, D.C., but it  soon became a peripatetic monthly, printed wherever the editor chanced  to be. In 1836 Lundy began the issue of an anti-slavery paper in  Philadelphia, called the National Inquirer, and with this was merged the  Genius of Universal Emancipation. He was preparing to resume the issue  of his original paper under the old title, in La Salle County, Illinois,  when he was overtaken by death on August 22, 1839.    Here was a man without education, without wealth, of a slight frame, not  at all robust, who had undertaken, singlehanded and without the shadow  of a doubt of his ultimate success, to abolish American slavery.  He began the organization of societies which were to displace the  anti-slavery societies of the previous century. He established the first  paper devoted exclusively to the cause of emancipation. He foresaw that  the question of emancipation must be carried into politics and that it  must become an object of concern to the general Government as well as to  the separate States. In the early part of his career he found the most  congenial association and the larger measure of effective support south  of Mason and Dixon's Line, and in this section were the greater number  of the abolition societies which he organized. During the later years  of his life, as it was becoming increasingly difficult in the South  to maintain a public anti-slavery propaganda, he transferred his chief  activities to the North. Lundy serves as a connecting link between the  earlier and the later anti-slavery movements. Eleven years of his early  life belong to the century of the Revolution. Garrison recorded his  indebtedness to Lundy in the words: \"If I have in any way, however  humble, done anything towards calling attention to slavery, or bringing  out the glorious prospect of a complete jubilee in our country at no  distant day, I feel that I owe everything in this matter, instrumentally  under God, to Benjamin Lundy.\"    Different in type, yet even more significant on account of its peculiar  relations to the cause of abolition, was the life of James Gillespie  Birney, who was born in a wealthy slaveholding family at Dansville,  Kentucky, in the year 1792. The Birneys were anti-slavery planters of  the type of Washington and Jefferson. The father had labored to make  Kentucky a free State at the time of its admission to the Union. His son  was educated first at Princeton, where he graduated in 1810, and then  in the office of a distinguished lawyer in Philadelphia. He began the  practice of law at his home at the age of twenty-two. His home training  and his residence in States which were then in the process of gradual  emancipation served to confirm him in the traditional conviction of his  family. While Benjamin Lundy,"]]]
