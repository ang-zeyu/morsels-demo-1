In summer when the sheep are driven up into the  mountains, the coyotes migrate to those sections and kill sheep  whenever the opportunity is presented. In the fall when the sheep are  brought down into the foothills, the coyotes are also to be found in  great numbers in those parts. In all probability there is a greater  loss occasioned by the depredations of coyotes in the two states  mentioned than is caused by wolves and mountain lions combined.  Farther south, however, it is the wolf that does the most mischief.  Where timber wolves are plentiful and very little stock is raised, as  in the northern parts of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, sheep are  not safe from the attacks of wolves, and for that reason few sheep  are raised in those parts. It is probably the fact that the western  range is very open and the sheep always carefully guarded by herders  that they suffer so little from timber wolves in the Western States.    In the swamps of the Southern States, and especially in the lowlands  of Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas, hogs are sometimes killed by  wolves. In New Mexico, Texas, Colorado and Mexico where large numbers  of goats are raised, these animals are frequently killed.    That an immense amount of game is killed in the wilder and less  thickly settled portions of the United States and Canada goes without  saying. In the West the wild game does not suffer as much as does the  domestic animals, but in the heavily timbered portions of the country  where little stock is raised as in the states bordering on Lake  Superior and in the greater part of Canada large numbers of deer and  other game animals fall victims to these fierce creatures. Regarding  the killing of game on the western cattle range, Mr. Bailey has the  following to say:    \"At Big Piney, Wyoming, I examined wolf dung in probably fifty places  around dens and along wolf trails. In about nine-tenths of the cases  it was composed mainly or entirely of cattle or horse hair; in all  other cases but one, of rabbit fur and bones, and in this one case  mainly of antelope hair. A herd of 20 or 30 antelope wintered about 5  or 6 miles from this den, and the old wolves frequently visited the  herd, but I could find no other evidence that they destroyed  antelope, though I followed wolf tracks for many miles among the  antelope tracks on the snow. Jack rabbits were killed and eaten along  the trails or brought to the den and eaten near it almost every  night, and a half eaten cottontail was found in the den with the  little pups. While wolves are usually found around antelope herds,  they are probably able to kill only the sick, crippled and young. The  following note from Wyoming appeared in the _Pinedale Roundup_ of  July 4, 1906:    While riding on the outside circle with the late round-up, Nelse  Jorgensen chanced to see a wolf making away with a fawn antelope. He  gave chase to the animal, but it succeeded in getting away, never  letting loose on its catch.    About a den near Cora, the numerous deposits of wolf dung on the  crest of the ridge not far away were found to be composed of horse  and cattle hair, though fresh elk tracks were abundant over the side  hills on all sides of the den, while cattle and horses were then to  be found only in the valley, 8 miles distant. Several jack rabbits  had been brought in and eaten and the old wolf on her way to the den  had laid down her load, evidently a jack rabbit, gone aside some 20  feet and caught a ruffed grouse eaten it on the spot, and then  resumed her load and her journey to the waiting pups. One small  carpal bone in this den may have been from a deer or small elk, but  no other trace of game was found.    Talking with hunters and trappers who spend much time in the  mountains when the snow is on the ground brought little positive  information on the destruction of elk or deer by wolves. Mr. George  Glover, a forest ranger long familiar with the Wind River Mountains  in both winter and summer, said that he had found a large blacktail  buck which the wolves had eaten, but he suspected that it had been  previously shot by hunters. In many winters of trapping where elk  were abundant, Mr. Glover has never found any evidence that elk had  been killed by wolves. Coyotes constantly follow the elk herds,  especially in spring when the calves are being born, and probably  destroy many of the young, but wolves apparently do not share this  habit. It seems probably, however, that in summer the young of both  elk and deer suffer to some extent while the wolves are among them in  the mountains.\"    In the Northern Peninsula of Michigan, wolves are very plentiful and  large numbers of deer are killed during the winter months, the  remains being found later by hunters, trappers, and lumbermen. The  same conditions exist in Northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, also in  parts of Ontario, Canada. In the Rainy River District, wolves have  always been abundant and much game has been killed by them. Farther  east, they are just making their appearance of late years having  followed the deer which are coming into the country from some other  section. Farther east, in the eastern portions of New Ontario and in  some parts of Quebec wolves are also numerous. One of our friends  from Northern Wisconsin writes as follows:      [Illustration: Remains of Deer Killed by Wolves.]    \"I have trapped and caught five old female wolves since I came to  Iron County, Wisconsin, six years ago. Two of them I got in Michigan,  Gogebic County, as I live almost on the line. There are times when  you can see six or eight wolf tracks all going down the river or  coming up at the same time. You can go again for a week and never see  a track. I have followed them for a week, in deep snow on snow shoes,  and never left their track, and in one week I set traps at 50  different deer that wolves had killed. I might have gotten a few more  wolves but the fox, mink, cats, skunk, owls and \"porkys\" (porcupines)  were bound to butt in. At one set I got a wolf, 3 foxes, 1 skunk, 1  mink and 10 porkys till June.    Two wolves caught a buck that would weigh 150 pounds, within 10 rods  of my camp one night. The next morning there was not one pound of  meat left on the bones.    I had a tent and one shanty in Gogebic County last winter, and I know  the wolves killed 500 deer on the snow. How many fawns and does did  they kill in summer time when you cannot see their tracks? The wild  cats are not so bad, a fawn, rabbit or partridge makes a meal for  them.\"    In the far north where the barren ground caribou is the principal  game animal, and where wolves are plentiful, there can be no doubt  that they kill large numbers of those animals. Musk oxen are also  killed, and farther south the moose is killed by wolves, but it is  our belief that the number is comparatively small. The moose is such  a large and powerful animal that even a band of half starved wolves  will, as a rule, pass it by, but there can be no doubt of the fact  that they do kill them on rare occasions.    The elk is a great enemy of the wolf and it appears that they are  seldom molested. Beyond all doubt the deer is the principal prey of  the timber wolf.        CHAPTER IV.    BOUNTIES.    For many years the state governments of the wolf infested country  have been paying bounties on wolves and coyotes, to encourage the  hunting and trapping of these animals. It is doubtful, however,  whether the bounties offered are sufficient to encourage any, other  than the regular trappers, to hunt wolves, and if they are, it has  certainly had no definite results, for the wolves and coyotes, taken  over the whole country, are practically as plentiful as ever.    Realizing that the state bounties were not a sufficient inducement to  trappers, certain of the counties of those states where wolves are  most abundant, offer additional bounty. This has the effect of  thinning the wolves out of that county alone, but they immediately  become more plentiful in the adjoining portions of the country.    In some of the Western States, the stockmen pay a bounty, in addition  to that offered by the state. Some of them even offer special  inducements, in addition to the bounties paid on the captured  animals, and among them may be mentioned, board and lodging for the  trapper, bait for the traps and the use of saddle and pack horses.    Such special offers to trappers have the effect of stimulating the  hunting and trapping of noxious animals in that immediate vicinity  and the result is, a thinning out of the animals for the time being.  Usually the trappers drift into those sections where the animals are  most plentiful and the bounty is highest.    One of the Government bulletins has the following to say regarding  the bounty question:    \"Bounties, even when excessively high, have proved ineffective in  keeping down the wolves, and the more intelligent ranchmen are  questioning whether the bounty system pays. In the past ten years  Wyoming has paid out in State bounties over $65,000 on wolves alone,  and $160,156 on wolves, coyotes and mountain lions together, and to  this must be added still larger sums in local and county bounties on  the same animals.\"    \"In many cases three bounties are paid on each wolf. In the upper  Green River Valley the local stockmen's association pays a bounty of  $10 on each wolf pup, $20 on each grown dog wolf, and $40 on each  bitch with pup. Fremont County adds $3 to each of these, and the  State of Wyoming $3 more. Many of the large ranchers pay a private  bounty of $10 to $20 in addition to the county and state bounty. Gov.  Bryant B. Brooks, of Wyoming, paid six years ago, on his ranch in  Natrona County, $10 each on 50 wolves in one year, and considered it  a good investment, since it practically cleared his range of wolves  for the time. It invariably happens, however, that when cleared out  of one section"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34523"],[0,"Fishes of Chautauqua, Cowley and Elk Counties, Kansas (#4)"],[1,"from refineries has also affected the  streams studied. The only refinery within the area is at Arkansas City.  In Butler County there are four refineries on the Walnut watershed  upstream from the area surveyed. Metzler (1952) noted that \"fish-kills\"  occurred from the mid-1940's until 1952 in connection with wastes  periodically discharged from these refineries. However, the largest  kill, in 1944, was attributed to excessive brine pollution.    In Arkansas City a meat-packing plant, a large railroad workshop, two  flour mills, two milk plants, and several small manufacturing plants  contribute wastes which may figure in industrial pollution. There are  milk plants and small poultry processing plants at Winfield. In  Chautauqua and Elk Counties there is little industrial activity.          CONSERVATION      In recent years several measures have been implemented or proposed to  conserve the water and land resources of the Arkansas River Basin.  Droughts and floods have focused public attention on such conservation.  Less spectacular, but nevertheless important, problems confronting  conservationists include streambank erosion, channel deterioration,  silting, recreational demands for water, and irrigation needs.    Congress has authorized the U. S. Corps of Engineers (by the Flood  Control Act of 1941) to construct six dam and reservoir projects in the  Verdigris watershed. Two of these--Hulah Reservoir in Osage County,  Oklahoma, on Big Caney River, and Fall River Reservoir in Greenwood  County, Kansas--have been completed. Other reservoirs authorized in the  Verdigris watershed include Toronto, Neodesha, and Elk City (Table  Mound) in Kansas and Oologah in Oklahoma. Construction is underway on  the Toronto Reservoir and some planning has been accomplished on the  Neodesha and Elk City projects.    The possibilities of irrigation projects in the Verdigris and Walnut  River basins are under investigation by the United States Bureau of  Reclamation (Foley, _et al._, 1955:F18).    An area of 11 square miles in Chautauqua and Montgomery Counties is  included in the Aiken Creek \"Pilot Watershed Project,\" a co-operative  effort by federal, state, and local agencies to obtain information as to  the effects of an integrated watershed protection program (Foley, _et  al._, 1955:131).          PREVIOUS ICHTHYOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS      Few accounts of fishes in the area here reported on have been published.  Evermann and Fordice (1886:184) made a collection from Timber Creek at  Winfield in 1884.    The State Biological Survey collected actively from 1910 to 1912, but  localities visited in the Arkansas River System were limited to the  Neosho and Verdigris River basins (Breukelman, 1940:377). The only  collection made in the area considered here was on the Elk River in Elk  County on July 11, 1912. The total species list of this collection is  not known.    In the years 1924-1929 Minna E. Jewell collected at various places in  central Kansas. On June 30, 1925, Jewell and Frank Jobes made  collections on Timber Creek and Silver Creek in Cowley County.    Hoyle (1936:285) mentions collections made by himself and Dr. Charles E.  Burt, who was then Professor of Biology at Southwestern College,  Winfield, Kansas. Records in the Department of Biology, Kansas State  Teachers College at Emporia, indicate that Dr. Burt and others made  collections in the area which have not been published on.

Cross for his interest in my  investigation, for his counsel, and for his penetrating criticism of  this paper. This study would have been impossible without the assistance  of several persons who helped in the field. Mr. Artie C. Metcalf and Mr.  Delbert Metcalf deserve special thanks for their enthusiastic and  untiring co-operation in collecting and preserving of specimens. Mrs.  Artie C. Metcalf, Miss Patricia Metcalf, Mr. Chester Metcalf, and Mr.  Forrest W. Metcalf gave help which is much appreciated. I am indebted to  the following persons for numerous valuable suggestions: Dr. John  Breukelman, Kansas State Teachers College, Emporia, Kansas; Dr. George  Moore, Oklahoma A&M College, and Mr. W. L. Minckley, Lawrence, Kansas.          MATERIALS AND METHODS      Collections were made by means of: (1) a four-foot net of nylon screen;  (2) a 10x4-foot \"common-sense\" woven seine with 1/4-inch mesh; (3) a  15x4-foot knotted mesh seine; (4) a 20x5-foot 1/4-inch mesh seine; (5)  pole and line (natural and artificial baits). At most stations the  four-foot, ten-foot, and twenty-foot seines were used; however, the  equipment that was used varied according to the size of pool, number of  obstructions, nature of bottom, amount of flow, and type of streambank.  Usually several hours were spent at each station and several stations  were revisited from time to time. Percentages noted in the List of  Species represent the relative number taken in the first five  seine-hauls at each station.          COLLECTING STATIONS      Collecting was done at stations listed below and shown in Fig. 2. Each  station was assigned a letter, designating the stream system on which  the station was located, and a number which indicates the position of  the station on the stream. This number increases progressively upstream  from mouth to source. Code letters used are as follows: A--Arkansas  River; W--Walnut River System; B--Beaver Creek System; C--Big Caney  River System; G--Grouse Creek System; M--Middle Caney Creek System;  E--Elk River System. All dates are in the year 1956.        [Illustration: FIG. 2.        Map of Cowley, Chautauqua and Elk counties, Kansas,        showing stations at which collecting was done.]    A-1. Arkansas River.
