It is well to  protest at all times against attempts to push science to the verge  of absurdity; and such must be the verdict upon endeavours to  determine positively such incomplete organisms as floating cells,  or hyaline threads which may belong to any one of fifty species of  moulds, or after all to an alga. This leads us to remark, in  passing, that there are forms and conditions under which fungi may  be found when, fructification being absent--that is, the vegetative  system alone developed--they approximate so closely to algae that it  is almost impossible to say to which group the organisms belong.    Finally, it is a great characteristic of fungi in general that they  are very rapid in growth, and rapid in decay. In a night a puffball  will grow prodigiously, and in the same short period a mass of paste  may be covered with mould. In a few hours a gelatinous mass of  _Reticularia_ will pass into a bladder of dust, or a _Coprinus_ will  be dripping into decay. Remembering this, mycophagists will take note  that a fleshy fungus which may be good eating at noon may undergo such  changes in a few hours as to be anything but good eating at night.  Many instances have been recorded of the rapidity of growth in fungi;  it may also be accepted as an axiom that they are, in many instances,  equally as rapid in decay.    The affinity between lichens and fungi has long been recognized to its  full and legitimate extent by lichenologists and mycologists.[I] In  the \"Introduction to Cryptogamic Botany,\" it was proposed to unite  them in one alliance, under the name of _Mycetales_, in the same  manner as the late Dr. Lindley had united allied orders under  alliances in his \"Vegetable Kingdom;\" but, beyond this, there was no  predisposition towards the theory since propounded, and which, like  all new theories, has collected a small but zealous circle of  adherents. It will be necessary briefly to summarize this theory and  the arguments by which it is supported and opposed, inasmuch as it is  intimately connected with our subject.    As recently as 1868, Professor Schwendener first propounded his  views,[J] and then briefly and vaguely, that all and every individual  lichen was but an algal, which had collected about it a parasitic  fungal growth, and that those peculiar bodies which, under the name of  _gonidia_, were considered as special organs of lichens, were only  imprisoned algae. In language which the Rev. J. M. Crombie[K] describes  as \"pictorial,\" this author gave the general conclusion at which he  had arrived, as follows:--\"As the result of my researches, all these  growths are not simple plants, not individuals in the usual sense of  the term; they are rather colonies, which consist of hundreds and  thousands of individuals, of which, however, only one acts as master,  while the others, in perpetual captivity, provide nourishment for  themselves and their master. This master is a fungus of the order  _Ascomycetes_, a parasite which is accustomed to live upon the work of  others; its slaves are green algae, which it has sought out, or indeed  caught hold of, and forced into its service. It surrounds them, as a  spider does its prey, with a fibrous net of narrow meshes, which is  gradually converted into an impenetrable covering. While, however, the  spider sucks its prey and leaves it lying dead, the fungus incites the  algae taken in its net to more rapid activity; nay, to more vigorous  increase.\" This hypothesis, ushered upon the world with all the  prestige of the Professor's name, was not long in meeting with  adherents, and the cardinal points insisted upon were--1st. That the  generic relationship of the coloured \"gonidia\" to the colourless  filaments which compose the lichen thallus, had only been assumed, and  not proved; 2nd. That the membrane of the gonidia was chemically  different from the membrane of the other tissues, inasmuch as the  first had a reaction corresponding to that of algae, whilst the second  had that of fungi; 3rd. That the different forms and varieties of  gonidia corresponded with parallel types of algae; 4th. That as the  germination of the spore had not been followed further than the  development of a hypothallus, it might be accounted for by the absence  of the essential algal on which the new organism should become  parasitic; 5th. That there is a striking correspondence between the  development of the fruit in lichens and in some of the sporidiiferous  fungi (_Pyrenomycetes_).    These five points have been combated incessantly by lichenologists,  who would really be supposed by ordinary minds to be the most  practically acquainted with the structure and development of these  plants, in opposition to the theorists. It is a fact which should have  some weight, that no lichenologist of repute has as yet accepted the  theory. In 1873 Dr. E. Bornet[L] came to the aid of Schwendener, and  almost exhausted the subject, but failed to convince either the  practised lichenologist or mycologist. The two great points sought to  be established are these, that what we call lichens are compound  organisms, not simple, independent vegetable entities; and that this  compound organism consists of unicellular algae, with a fungus  parasitic upon them. The coloured gonidia which are found in the  substance, or thallus of lichens, are the supposed algae; and the  cellular structure which surrounds, encloses, and imprisons the  gonidia is the parasitic fungus, which is parasitic on something  infinitely smaller than itself, and which it entirely and absolutely  isolates from all external influences.    Dr. Bornet believed himself to have established that every gonidium of  a lichen may be referred to a species of algae, and that the connection  between the hypha and gonidia is of such a nature as to exclude all  possibility of the one organ being produced by the other. This he  thinks is the only way in which it can be accounted for that the  gonidia of diverse lichens should be almost identical.    Dr. Nylander, in referring to this hypothesis of an imprisoned  algal,[M] writes: \"The absurdity of such an hypothesis is evident from  the very consideration that it cannot be the case that an organ  (gonidia) should at the same time be a parasite on the body of which  it exercises vital functions; for with equal propriety it might be  contended that the liver or the spleen constitutes parasites of the  mammiferae. Parasite existence is autonomous, living upon a foreign  body, of which nature prohibits it from being at the same time an  organ. This is an elementary axiom of general physiology. But  observation directly made teaches that the green matter originally  arises within the primary chlorophyll- or phycochrom-bearing cellule,  and consequently is not intruded from any external quarter, nor arises  in any way from any parasitism of any kind. The cellule at first is  observed to be empty, and then, by the aid of secretion, green matter  is gradually produced in the cavity and assumes a definite form. It  can, therefore, be very easily and evidently demonstrated that the  origin of green matter in lichens is entirely the same as in other  plants.\" On another occasion, and in another place, the same eminent  lichenologist remarks,[N] as to the supposed algoid nature of  gonidia--\"that such an unnatural existence as they would thus pass,  enclosed in a prison and deprived of all autonomous liberty, is not  at all consonant with the manner of existence of the other algae, and  that it has no parallel in nature, for nothing physiologically  analogous occurs anywhere else. Krempelhuber has argued that there are  no conclusive reasons against the assumption that the lichen-gonidia  may be self-developed organs of the lichen proper rather than algae,  and that these gonidia can continue to vegetate separately, and so be  mistaken for unicellular algae.\" In this Th. Fries seems substantially  to concur. But there is one strong argument, or rather a repetition of  an argument already cited, placed in a much stronger light, which is  employed by Nylander in the following words:--\"So far are what are  called algae, according to the turbid hypothesis of Schwendener, from  constituting true algae, that on the contrary it may be affirmed that  they have a lichenose nature, whence it follows that these pseudo-algae  are in a systematic arrangement to be referred rather to the lichens,  and that the class of algae hitherto so vaguely limited should be  circumscribed by new and truer limits.\"    As to another phase in this question, there are, as Krempelhuber  remarks, species of lichens which in many countries do not fructify,  and whose propagation can only be carried on by means of the soredia,  and the hyphae of such could in themselves alone no more serve for  propagation than the hyphae from the pileus or stalk of an Agaric,  while it is highly improbable that they could acquire this faculty by  interposition of a foreign algal. On the other hand he argues: \"It is  much more conformable to nature that the gonidia, as self-developed  organs of the lichens, should, like the spores, enable the hyphae  proceeding from them to propagate the individual.\"[O]    A case in point has been adduced[P] in which gonidia were produced by  the hypha, and the genus _Emericella_,[Q] which is allied to _Husseia_  in the _Trichogastres_, shows a structure in the stem exactly  resembling _Palmella botryoides_ of Greville, and to what occurs in  _Synalyssa_. _Emericella_, with one or two other genera, must,  however, be considered as connecting _Trichogastres_ with lichens, and  the question cannot be considered as satisfactorily decided till a  series of experiments has been made on the germination of lichen  spores and their relation to free algae considered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30221"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#4)"],[1,"skins for  exportation, had removed all traces of legs, so that it was popularly  supposed they possessed none, and on account of their want of feet and  their great beauty, were called the Birds of Paradise, retaining, it was  thought, the forms they had borne in the Garden of Eden, living upon dew  or ether, through which it was imagined they perpetually floated by the  aid of their long cloud-like plumage.    Of one in confinement Dr. Bennett says: \"I observed the bird, before  eating a grasshopper, place the insect upon the perch, keep it firmly  fixed by the claws, and, divesting it of the legs, wings, etc., devour  it with the head always first. It rarely alights upon the ground, and so  proud is the creature of its elegant dress that it never permits a soil  to remain upon it, frequently spreading out its wings and feathers,  regarding its splendid self in every direction.\"    The sounds uttered by this bird are very peculiar, resembling somewhat  the cawing of the Raven, but change gradually to a varied scale in  musical gradations, like _he, hi, ho, how_! He frequently raises his  voice, sending forth notes of such power as to be heard at a long  distance. These notes are _whack_, _whack_, uttered in a barking tone,  the last being a low note in conclusion.    While creeping amongst the branches in search of insects, he utters a  soft clucking note. During the entire day he flies incessantly from one  tree to another, perching but a few moments, and concealing himself  among the foliage at the least suspicion of danger.    In Bennett's \"Wanderings\" is an entertaining description of Mr. Beale's  bird at Maceo. \"This elegant bird,\" he says, \"has a light, playful, and  graceful manner, with an arch and impudent look, dances about when a  visitor approaches the cage, and seems delighted at being made an object  of admiration. It bathes twice daily, and after performing its ablutions  throws its delicate feathers up nearly over its head, the quills of  which have a peculiar structure, enabling the bird to effect this  object. To watch this bird make its toilet is one of the most  interesting sights of nature; the vanity which inspires its every  movement, the rapturous delight with which it views its enchanting  self, its arch look when demanding the spectator's admiration, are all  pardonable in a delicate creature so richly embellished, so neat and  cleanly, so fastidious in its tastes, so scrupulously exact in its  observances, and so winning in all its ways.\"    Says a traveler in New Guinea: \"As we were drawing near a small grove of  teak-trees, our eyes were dazzled with a sight more beautiful than any I  had yet beheld. It was that of a Bird of Paradise moving through the  bright light of the morning sun. I now saw that the birds must be seen  alive in their native forests, in order to fully comprehend the poetic  beauty of the words Birds of Paradise. They seem the inhabitants of a  fairer world than ours, things that have wandered in some way from their  home, and found the earth to show us something of the beauty of worlds  beyond.\"          THE YELLOW THROATED TOUCAN.      I am a Toucan and I live in a very warm country.    See my handsome black coat and my yellow vest.    My toes are like a parrot's, two in front and two behind.    They help me to hold to the limbs.    Look at my large beak. It looks heavy but it is not, as it is filled  with air cells. These make it very light. Do you like my blue eyes?    My nest is very hard to find. If I tell you where it is, you will not  take the eggs, will you? It is in a hollow limb of a very high tree.    I am very fond of fruit, and for this reason the people on the  plantations do not like me very well.    I can fly very fast, but I cannot get along so well on the ground. I  keep my feet far apart and hop.    I like to sit in the top of the tallest trees. Then I am not afraid.  Nothing can reach me there but a rifle ball.    I do not like the owl, he is so ugly. When we find an owl we get in a  circle around him and snap our great beaks, and jerk our tails up and  down and scream. He is very much afraid of us.    The people where I live like our yellow breasts. They wear them on their  heads, and also put them on the ends of their bows.    We sometimes sit together in a tree and snap our beaks and shout. This  is why we have been called \"Preacher Birds.\"    We can scream so loud that we may be heard a mile away. Our song is  \"Tucano! Tucano!\"    I think it is a pretty song, but the people do not like it very much.    [Illustration: YELLOW THROATED TOUCAN.]          THE YELLOW THROATED TOUCAN.      The Toucans are a numerous race of South American birds, at once  recognizable by the prodigious size of their beaks and by the richness  of their plumage. \"These birds are very common,\" says Prince Von Wied,  \"in all parts of the extensive forests of the Brazils and are killed  for the table in large numbers during the cool seasons. Their eggs are  deposited in the hollow limbs and holes of the colossal trees, so common  in the tropical forests, but their nests are very difficult to find. The  egg is said to be white. They are very fond of fruit, oranges, guavas  and plantains, and when these fruits are ripe make sad havoc among the  neighboring plantations. In return for these depredations the planter  eats their flesh, which is very delicate.\"    The flight of these birds is easy and graceful, sweeping with facility  over the loftiest trees of their native forests, their strangely  developed bills being no encumbrance to them, replete as they are with a  tissue of air-filled cells rendering them very light and even buoyant.    On the ground they get along with a rather awkward hopping movement,  their legs being kept widely apart. In ascending a tree they do not  climb but mount from one branch to another with a series of jumps,  ascending to the tops of the very loftiest trees, safe from every  missile except a rifle ball. They have a habit of sitting on the  branches in flocks, lifting their bills, clattering them together, and  shouting hoarsely all the while, from which custom the natives call them  Preacher-birds. Sometimes the whole party, including the sentinel, set  up a simultaneous yell so deafeningly loud that it can be heard a mile.  They are very loquacious birds and are often discovered through their  perpetual chattering. Their cry resembles the word \"Tucano,\" which has  given origin to the peculiar name.    When settling itself to sleep, the Toucan packs itself up in a very  systematic manner, supporting its huge beak by resting it on its back,  and tucking it completely among the feathers, while it doubles its tail  across its back just as if it moved on hinges. So completely is the  large bill hidden among the feathers, that hardly a trace of it is  visible in spite of its great size and bright color, so that the bird  when sleeping looks like a great ball of loose feathers.    Sir R. Owen concludes that the large beak is of service in masticating  food compensating for the absence of any grinding structures in the  intestinal tract.    Says a naturalist: \"We turned into a gloomy forest and for some time saw  nothing but a huge brown moth, which looked almost like a bat on the  wing. Suddenly we heard high upon the trees a short shrieking sort of  noise ending in a hiss, and our guide became excited and said, \"Toucan!\"  The birds were very wary and made off. They are much in quest and often  shot at. At last we caught sight of a pair, but they were at the top of  such a high tree that they were out of range. Presently, when I had  about lost hope, I heard loud calls, and three birds came and settled in  a low bush in the middle of the path. I shot one and it proved to be a  very large toucan. The bird was not quite dead when I picked it up, and  it bit me severely with its huge bill.\"          THE RED-RUMPED TANAGER.      I have just been singing my morning song, and I wish you could have  heard it. I think you would have liked it.    I always sing very early in the morning. I sing because I am happy, and  the people like to hear me.    My home is near a small stream, where there are low woods and underbrush  along its banks.    There is an old dead tree there, and just before the sun is up I fly to  this tree.    I sit on one of the branches and sing for about half an hour. Then I fly  away to get my breakfast.    I am very fond of fruit. Bananas grow where I live, and I like them best  of all.    I eat insects, and sometimes I fly to the rice fields and swing on the  stalks and eat rice.    The people say I do much harm to the rice, but I do not see why it is  wrong for me to eat it, for I think there is enough for all.    I must go now and get my breakfast. If you ever come to see me I will  sing to you.    I will show you my wife, too. She looks just like me. Be sure to get up  very early. If you do not, you will be too late for my song.           *       *       *        \"Birds, Birds! ye are beautiful things,       With your earth-treading feet and your cloud-cleaving wings.
