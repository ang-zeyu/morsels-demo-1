Behind a ragged curtain a second room was partly visible.  Hendricks saw the corner of a cot, some blankets, clothes hung on a  hook.    \"We were here,\" the soldier beside him said. He took off his helmet,  pushing his blond hair back. \"I'm Corporal Rudi Maxer. Polish.  Impressed in the Soviet Army two years ago.\" He held out his hand.    Hendricks hesitated and then shook. \"Major Joseph Hendricks.\"    \"Klaus Epstein.\" The other soldier shook with him, a small dark man  with thinning hair. Epstein plucked nervously at his ear. \"Austrian.  Impressed God knows when. I don't remember. The three of us were here,  Rudi and I, with Tasso.\" He indicated the woman. \"That's how we  escaped. All the rest were down in the bunker.\"    \"And--and _they_ got in?\"    Epstein lit a cigarette. \"First just one of them. The kind that tagged  you. Then it let others in.\"    Hendricks became alert. \"The _kind_? Are there more than one kind?\"    \"The little boy. David. David holding his teddy bear. That's Variety  Three. The most effective.\"    \"What are the other types?\"    Epstein reached into his coat. \"Here.\" He tossed a packet of  photographs onto the table, tied with a string. \"Look for yourself.\"    Hendricks untied the string.    \"You see,\" Rudi Maxer said, \"that was why we wanted to talk terms. The  Russians, I mean. We found out about a week ago. Found out that your  claws were beginning to make up new designs on their own. New types of  their own. Better types. Down in your underground factories behind our  lines. You let them stamp themselves, repair themselves. Made them  more and more intricate. It's your fault this happened.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hendricks examined the photos. They had been snapped hurriedly; they  were blurred and indistinct. The first few showed--David. David  walking along a road, by himself. David and another David. Three  Davids. All exactly alike. Each with a ragged teddy bear.    All pathetic.    \"Look at the others,\" Tasso said.    The next pictures, taken at a great distance, showed a towering  wounded soldier sitting by the side of a path, his arm in a sling, the  stump of one leg extended, a crude crutch on his lap. Then two wounded  soldiers, both the same, standing side by side.    \"That's Variety One. The Wounded Soldier.\" Klaus reached out and took  the pictures. \"You see, the claws were designed to get to human  beings. To find them. Each kind was better than the last. They got  farther, closer, past most of our defenses, into our lines. But as  long as they were merely _machines_, metal spheres with claws and  horns, feelers, they could be picked off like any other object. They  could be detected as lethal robots as soon as they were seen. Once we  caught sight of them--\"    \"Variety One subverted our whole north wing,\" Rudi said. \"It was a  long time before anyone caught on. Then it was too late. They came in,  wounded soldiers, knocking and begging to be let in. So we let them  in. And as soon as they were in they took over. We were watching out  for machines....\"    \"At that time it was thought there was only the one type,\" Klaus  Epstein said. \"No one suspected there were other types. The pictures  were flashed to us. When the runner was sent to you, we knew of just  one type. Variety One. The big Wounded Soldier. We thought that was  all.\"    \"Your line fell to--\"    \"To Variety Three. David and his bear. That worked even better.\" Klaus  smiled bitterly. \"Soldiers are suckers for children. We brought them  in and tried to feed them. We found out the hard way what they were  after. At least, those who were in the bunker.\"    \"The three of us were lucky,\" Rudi said. \"Klaus and I were--were  visiting Tasso when it happened. This is her place.\" He waved a big  hand around. \"This little cellar. We finished and climbed the ladder  to start back. From the ridge we saw. There they were, all around the  bunker. Fighting was still going on. David and his bear. Hundreds of  them. Klaus took the pictures.\"    Klaus tied up the photographs again.           *       *       *       *       *    \"And it's going on all along your line?\" Hendricks said.    \"Yes.\"    \"How about _our_ lines?\" Without thinking, he touched the tab on his  arm. \"Can they--\"    \"They're not bothered by your radiation tabs. It makes no difference  to them, Russian, American, Pole, German. It's all the same. They're  doing what they were designed to do. Carrying out the original idea.  They track down life, wherever they find it.\"    \"They go by warmth,\" Klaus said. \"That was the way you constructed  them from the very start. Of course, those you designed were kept back  by the radiation tabs you wear. Now they've got around that. These new  varieties are lead-lined.\"    \"What's the other variety?\" Hendricks asked. \"The David type, the  Wounded Soldier--what's the other?\"    \"We don't know.\" Klaus pointed up at the wall. On the wall were two  metal plates, ragged at the edges. Hendricks got up and studied them.  They were bent and dented.    \"The one on the left came off a Wounded Soldier,\" Rudi said. \"We got  one of them. It was going along toward our old bunker. We got it from  the ridge, the same way we got the David tagging you.\"    The plate was stamped: I-V. Hendricks touched the other plate. \"And  this came from the David type?\"    \"Yes.\" The plate was stamped: III-V.    Klaus took a look at them, leaning over Hendricks' broad shoulder.  \"You can see what we're up against. There's another type. Maybe it was  abandoned. Maybe it didn't work. But there must be a Second Variety.  There's One and Three.\"    \"You were lucky,\" Rudi said. \"The David tagged you all the way here  and never touched you. Probably thought you'd get it into a bunker,  somewhere.\"    \"One gets in and it's all over,\" Klaus said. \"They move fast. One lets  all the rest inside. They're inflexible. Machines with one purpose.  They were built for only one thing.\" He rubbed sweat from his lip. \"We  saw.\"    They were silent.    \"Let me have another cigarette, Yank,\" Tasso said. \"They are good. I  almost forgot how they were.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It was night. The sky was black. No stars were visible through the  rolling clouds of ash. Klaus lifted the lid cautiously so that  Hendricks could look out.    Rudi pointed into the darkness. \"Over that way are the bunkers. Where  we used to be. Not over half a mile from us. It was just chance Klaus  and I were not there when it happened. Weakness. Saved by our lusts.\"    \"All the rest must be dead,\" Klaus said in a low voice. \"It came  quickly. This morning the Politburo reached their decision. They  notified us--forward command. Our runner was sent out at once. We saw  him start toward the direction of your lines. We covered him until he  was out of sight.\"    \"Alex Radrivsky. We both knew him. He disappeared about six o'clock.  The sun had just come up. About noon Klaus and I had an hour relief.  We crept off, away from the bunkers. No one was watching. We came  here. There used to be a town here, a few houses, a street. This  cellar was part of a big farmhouse. We knew Tasso would be here,  hiding down in her little place. We had come here before. Others from  the bunkers came here. Today happened to be our turn.\"    \"So we were saved,\" Klaus said. \"Chance. It might have been others.  We--we finished, and then we came up to the surface and started back  along the ridge. That was when we saw them, the Davids. We understood  right away. We had seen the photos of the First Variety, the Wounded  Soldier. Our Commissar distributed them to us with an explanation. If  we had gone another step they would have seen us. As it was we had to  blast two Davids before we got back. There were hundreds of them, all  around. Like ants. We took pictures and slipped back here, bolting the  lid tight.\"    \"They're not so much when you catch them alone. We moved faster than  they did. But they're inexorable. Not like living things. They came  right at us. And we blasted them.\"    Major Hendricks rested against the edge of the lid, adjusting his eyes  to the darkness. \"Is it safe to have the lid up at all?\"    \"If we're careful. How else can you operate your transmitter?\"    Hendricks lifted the small belt transmitter slowly. He pressed it  against his ear. The metal was cold and damp. He blew against the  mike, raising up the short antenna. A faint hum sounded in his ear.  \"That's true, I suppose.\"    But he still hesitated.    \"We'll pull you under if anything happens,\" Klaus said.    \"Thanks.\" Hendricks waited a moment, resting the transmitter against  his shoulder. \"Interesting, isn't it?\"    \"What?\"    \"This, the new types. The new varieties of claws. We're completely at  their mercy, aren't we? By now they've probably gotten into the UN  lines, too. It makes me wonder if we're not seeing the beginning of a  new species. _The_ new species. Evolution. The race to come after  man.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Rudi grunted. \"There is no race after man.\"    \"No? Why not? Maybe we're seeing it now, the end of human beings, the  beginning of the new society.\"    \"They're not a race. They're mechanical killers. You made them to  destroy. That's all they can do. They're machines with a job.\"    \"So it seems now. But how about later on? After the war is over.  Maybe, when there aren't any humans to destroy, their real  potentialities will begin to show.\"    \"You talk as if they were alive!\"    \"Aren't they?\"    There was silence. \"They're machines,\" Rudi said. \"They look like  people, but they're machines.\"    \"Use your transmitter, Major,\" Klaus said. \"We can't stay up here  forever.\"    Holding the transmitter tightly Hendricks called the code of the  command bunker. He waited, listening. No response. Only silence. He  checked the leads carefully. Everything was in place.    \"Scott!\" he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32069"],[0,"Letters from a Cat (#4)"],[1,"myself, I found your  dear mother holding me, and wiping my face with her own nice  handkerchief wet in cold water. My right fore-paw was badly bruised, and  that troubles me very much about washing my face, and about writing. But  the worst of all is the condition of my nose. Everybody laughs who sees  me, and I do not blame them; it is twice as large as it used to be, and  I begin to be seriously afraid it will never return to its old shape.  This will be a dreadful affliction: for who does not know that the nose  is the chief beauty of a cat's face? I have got very tired of hearing  the story of my fall told to all the people who come in. They laugh as  if they would kill themselves at it, especially when I do not manage to  get under the table before they look to see how my nose is.    Except for this I should have written to you before, and would write  more now, but my paw aches badly, and one of my eyes is nearly closed  from the swelling of my nose: so I must say good-by.         Your affectionate Pussy.    P. S. I told you about Caesar, did I not, in my last letter? Of course I  do not venture out of the house in my present plight, so I have not seen  him except from the window.         [Illustration: \"Can you imagine how ashamed I felt? I ran under the       table and did not come out again until after Mrs. Hitchcock had       gone.\"--Page 54.]         [Illustration: \"I knew that there was no time to be lost if I meant       to catch that robin, so I ran with all my might and tried to jump       through.\"--Page 55.]          V.      My Dear Helen:    I am sure you must have wondered why I have not written to you for the  last two weeks, but when you hear what I have been through, you will  only wonder that I am alive to write to you at all. I was very glad to  hear your mother say, yesterday, that she had not written to you about  what had happened to me, because it would make you so unhappy. But now  that it is all over, and I am in a fair way to be soon as well as ever,  I think you will like to hear the whole story.    In my last letter I told you about the new black cat, Caesar, who had  come to live in the Nelson house, and how anxious I was to know him. As  soon as my nose was fit to be seen, Judge Dickinson's cat, who is a  good, hospitable old soul, in spite of her stupidity, invited me to tea,  and asked him too. All the other cats were asked to come later in the  evening, and we had a grand frolic, hunting rats in the Judge's great  barn. Caesar is certainly the handsomest and most gentlemanly cat I  ever saw. He paid me great attention: in fact, so much, that one of  those miserable half-starved cats from Mill Valley grew so jealous that  she flew at me and bit my ear till it bled, which broke up the party.  But Caesar went home with me, so I did not care; then we sat and talked a  long time under the nursery window. I was so much occupied in what he  was saying, that I did not hear Mary open the window overhead, and was  therefore terribly frightened when there suddenly came down on us a  whole pailful of water. I was so startled that I lost all presence of  mind; and without bidding him good-night, I jumped directly into the  cellar window by which we were sitting. Oh, my dear Helen, I can never  give you any idea of what followed. Instead of coming down as I expected  to on the cabbages, which were just under that window the last time I  was in the cellar, I found myself sinking, sinking, into some horrible  soft, slimy, sticky substance, which in an instant more would have  closed over my head, and suffocated me; but, fortunately, as I sank, I  felt something hard at one side, and making a great effort, I caught on  it with my claws. It proved to be the side of a barrel, and I succeeded  in getting one paw over the edge of it. There I hung, growing weaker and  weaker every minute, with this frightful stuff running into my eyes and  ears, and choking me with its bad smell. I mewed as loud as I could,  which was not very loud, for whenever I opened my mouth the stuff  trickled into it off my whiskers; but I called to Caesar, who stood in  great distress at the window, and explained to him, as well as I could,  what had happened to me, and begged him to call as loudly as possible;  for if somebody did not come very soon, and take me out, I should  certainly die. He insisted, at first, on jumping down to help me  himself; but I told him that would be the most foolish thing he could  do; if he did, we should certainly both be drowned. So he began to mew  at the top of his voice, and between his mewing and mine, there was  noise enough for a few minutes; then windows began to open, and I heard  your grandfather swearing and throwing out a stick of wood at Caesar;  fortunately he was so near the house that it did not hit him. At last  your grandfather came downstairs, and opened the back door; and Caesar  was so frightened that he ran away, for which I have never thought so  well of him since, though we are still very good friends. When I heard  him running off, and calling back to me, from a distance, that he was so  sorry he could not help me, my courage began to fail, and in a moment  more, I should have let go of the edge of the barrel, and sunk to the  bottom; but luckily your grandfather noticed that there was something  very strange about my mewing, and opened the door at the head of the  cellar stairs, saying, \"I do believe the cat is in some trouble down  here.\" Then I made a great effort and mewed still more piteously. How I  wished I could call out and say, \"Yes, indeed, I am; drowning to death,  in I'm sure I don't know what, but something a great deal worse than  water!\" However, he understood me as it was, and came down with a lamp.  As soon as he saw me, he set the lamp down on the cellar bottom, and  laughed so that he could hardly move. I thought this was the most cruel  thing I ever heard of. If I had not been, as it were, at death's door, I  should have laughed at him, too, for even with my eyes full of that  dreadful stuff, I could see that he looked very funny in his red  night-cap, and without his teeth. He called out to Mary, and your  mother, who stood at the head of the stairs, \"Come down, come down;  here's the cat in the soft-soap barrel!\" and then he laughed again, and  they both came down the stairs laughing, even your dear kind mother, who  I never could have believed would laugh at any one in such trouble. They  did not seem to know what to do at first; nobody wanted to touch me; and  I began to be afraid I should drown while they stood looking at me, for  I knew much better than they could how weak I was from holding on to the  edge of the barrel so long. At last your grandfather swore that oath of  his,--you know the one I mean, the one he always swears when he is very  sorry for anybody,--and lifted me out by the nape of my neck, holding me  as far off from him as he could, for the soft soap ran off my legs and  tail in streams. He carried me up into the kitchen, and put me down in  the middle of the floor, and then they all stood round me, and laughed  again, so loud that they waked up the cook, who came running out of  her bedroom with her tin candlestick and a chair in her hand, thinking  that robbers were breaking in. At last your dear mother said, \"Poor  pussy, it is too bad to laugh at you, when you are in such pain\" (I had  been thinking so for some time). \"Mary, bring the small washtub. The  only thing we can do is to wash her.\"    When I heard this, I almost wished they had left me to drown in the soft  soap; for if there is any thing of which I have a mortal dread, it is  water. However, I was too weak to resist; and they plunged me in all  over, into the tub full of ice-cold water, and Mary began to rub me  with her great rough hands, which, I assure you, are very different from  yours and your mother's. Then they all laughed again to see the white  lather it made; in two minutes the whole tub was as white as the water  under the mill-wheel that you and I have so often been together to see.  You can imagine how my eyes smarted. I burnt my paws once in getting a  piece of beefsteak out of the coals where it had fallen off the  gridiron, but the pain of that was nothing to this. You will hardly  believe me when I tell you that they had to empty the tub and fill it  again ten times before the soap was all washed out of my fur. By that  time I was so cold and exhausted, that I could not move, and they began  to think I should die. But your mother rolled me up in one of your old  flannel petticoats, and made a nice bed for me behind the stove. By this  time even Mary began to seem sorry for me, though she was very cross at  first, and hurt me much more than she need to in washing me; now she  said, \"You're nothing but a poor beast of a cat, to be sure; but it's  mesilf that would be sorry to have the little mistress come back, and  find ye kilt.\" So you see your love for me did me service, even when  you were so far away. I doubt very much whether they would have ever  taken the trouble to nurse me through this sickness, except for your  sake. But I must leave the rest for my next letter. I am not strong  enough yet to write more than two hours at a time.         Your affectionate Pussy.

My Dear Helen:    I will begin where I left off in my last letter.    As you may imagine, I did not get any sleep that night, not even so much  as a cat's nap, as people say, though how cat's naps differ from men's  and women's naps, I don't know. I"]]]
