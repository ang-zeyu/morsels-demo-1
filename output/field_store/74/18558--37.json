A heavy rain on August 9 made  accurate count of occupied burrows possible. In Prater Canyon the  occupied area extended 200 feet south of the area occupied in 1943. In  Morfield Canyon no change had occurred. North of the fence in Morfield  Canyon 130 occupied burrows were counted. More than one hole, if judged  to be part of the same burrow system, were counted as one. The  vegetation within the colony had continued to improve in spite of the  large population of prairie dogs.    On August 8 and 14, 1945, although a careful search was made, the only  prairie dogs found in Prater Canyon were living in one burrow fifty  yards from the Maintenance Camp. In Morfield Canyon the colony had  decreased. Occupied burrows were found on the west side of the canyon  near the fence and above the well (17 burrows), and below the well on  the west side (estimated 30 burrows). The total population in both  canyons was estimated to be 100, compared with 800 in the preceding  year. The ground-water table was thought to be rising, and vegetation  was increasing.    On August 12, 1946, two prairie dogs were observed in Prater Canyon, one  near the Maintenance Camp, and the other a mile to the south. In  Morfield Canyon 18 occupied burrows were found north of the fence and 36  below the well, in the same two areas occupied in 1945.    On August 12, 1947, two animals were seen at one of the localities  occupied a year earlier in Prater Canyon, and three burrows were  occupied. In Morfield Canyon 119 occupied burrows were counted. At least  12 dens occupied by badgers were present in 1946, and four in 1947.    On August 9, 1948, no evidence of living prairie dogs was found in  Prater Canyon. In Morfield Canyon 45 burrows were counted north of the  fence. The grass had been increasing in abundance for several years.    On August 18, 1949, no evidence of living prairie dogs was found in  either canyon. In 1951 five prairie dogs were said to have been seen in  Prater Canyon in June and July. No other observations have been  recorded.    On June 22, 1956, 13 pups and 7 adult prairie dogs were released in an  enclosure in Morfield Canyon. Periodic inspections in the summer  revealed that the colony was surviving and healthy. By the following  spring no prairie dogs remained. Another reintroduction is planned this  year (1960).    Both the history of the prairie dogs and the history of the viewpoint of  people toward them are interesting. Individual views have ranged from a  desire to exterminate all the prairie dogs to a desire to leave them  undisturbed by man.    In review: The early history of prairie dogs on the Mesa Verde is not  well documented but reports are available of the absence of prairie dogs  before settlement by white men, and of introductions of prairie dogs.  Other reports indicate that prairie dogs have been observed far from  established colonies; therefore natural invasion may account for the  establishment of prairie dogs on the Mesa. Grazing of moderate to heavy  intensity by livestock continued in Morfield Canyon until 1941.  Cessation of grazing and above average precipitation were accompanied by  increased growth of vegetation in the colonies of prairie dogs. Mr. Wade  has suggested that flooding of burrows by ground water drove prairie  dogs from some lower parts of the floors of the canyons, and that  increased vegetation favored predators, primarily badgers and coyotes,  which further reduced the population. The abruptness of the decline,  especially in Prater Canyon, is consistent with the theory that some  epidemic disease occurred. This possibility was considered at the time  of the decline, and a Mobile Laboratory of the United States Public  Health Service spent from June 5 to June 25, 1947, in the Park  collecting rodents and their fleas for study. The primary concern was  plague, which had been detected in neighboring states. No evidence of  plague or of tularemia was reported after study of 494 small rodents  obtained from 13 localities in the Park. Only six prairie dogs (all from  Morfield Canyon) were studied. The negative report does not prove that  tularemia or some other disease was not a factor in the decimation of  the colony in Prater Canyon the year before.    If prairie dogs were able to survive primarily because of over-grazing  by domestic animals, future introductions may fail. If disease was the  major factor in their disappearance, reintroductions may succeed.

In 1956, I observed _S. lateralis_ 1/2 mi. W of Park Point, 3/4 mi. WSW  Park Point, in the public campground at Park Headquarters, at the lower  well in Prater Canyon, and at two other places on the North Rim. Other  observations on file were made at Prater Grade, Park Point, \"D\" cut (on  North Rim 1 mi. WSW Park Point), and Morfield Canyon. A juvenile was  noted at Park Point on June 28, 1952, by Jean Pinkley, and five young  were seen together at \"D\" cut on July 3, 1935. The earliest observation,  also recorded by Jean Pinkley, was on February 1, 1947. All of the  localities with the exception of Park Headquarters are above 7500 feet,  and most of the localities are in vegetation that is predominantly  oak-brush.

NE of Cliff       Palace, MV 7893/507; and Spruce Tree House, 4334 in Denver Museum.    Specimen number 7893/507 had 360 Purshia seeds in its cheek-pouches  according to a note on the label. On July 18, 1960, I found a young male  rock squirrel dead on the road a mile north of headquarters that had 234  pinyon seeds in its cheek-pouches. Young, recorded as \"half-grown,\" have  been observed in May and July. The first appearance may be as early as  January. In 1950, D. Watson thought that they did not hibernate, except  for a few days when the weather was stormy. I observed a rock squirrel  in August in the public campground at Park Headquarters sitting on its  haunches on a branch of a juniper some twelve feet from the ground and  eating an object held in its forefeet. The rock squirrel ranges  throughout the Park in all habitats.

N Rock Springs, 8200 ft., 69276-69277.    Five of the fourteen specimens of known sex are females, all of which  were taken in August and September, and none of which is recorded as  having contained embryos. The skulls of the eight August-taken specimens  also suggest that young are born in late spring or early summer: the  largest skull had well-worn teeth that might indicate an age of more  than one year; four others had complete adult dentitions that were  barely worn; and three had not yet acquired complete adult dentitions.    The records of _E. minimus_, like those of _Spermophilus lateralis_,  indicate greatest abundance in the higher parts of the Mesa Verde and in  areas of predominantly brushy vegetation.

Although both species occur in some of the same areas, _E. q. hopiensis_  is more abundant than is _E. minimus_ in stands of pinyon and juniper,  along cliffs, and at low elevations. (A specimen of _hopiensis_, MV  7849/507, from 3 mi. S of the Park boundary where the 6000 foot contour  line cross the Mancos River is indicative of the occurrence at low  elevations.)

Left  forelimb, showing characters of both a crossopterygian fin and an  amphibian foot. KU 10295, x 4.]    The proximal end of the humerus is more rounded anteriorly than  posteriorly, and has a thin articular border that bore a cartilaginous  cap as the primary surface for articulation with the scapulocoracoid.  Although the unfinished surface of the head extends down the anterior  margin about a third the length of the humerus, the shaft has been  broken and so twisted that the distal part is not in the same plane as  the proximal. Immediately posterior to the cartilaginous cap is a  round, deep notch bordered posteriorly by the dorsal process of the  head.    The shaft is longer and narrower than would be anticipated in a  primitive amphibian limb (cf. Romer, 1947). The distal end bears two  surfaces for articulation with the radius and ulna. The full extent of  the former surface was not determined because the more anterior part of  the expanded end is represented only by an impression. The surface  nearest the ulna was partially rounded for articulation with that  element, the remaining posterior edge being broadly concave. The most  striking feature of the humerus is a slender hooklike process on the  posterior edge near the distal end, probably homologous with (1) the  posterior flange on the \"humerus\" in Rhipidistia, and (2) the  entepicondyle of the humerus in _Archeria_ (Romer, 1957) and other  tetrapods.    The radius is about the same width proximally as distally. The  curvature of the shaft is approximately alike on both sides. Distally  the surface is rounded for articulation with the radiale and perhaps  the intermedium.    The proximal end of the ulna is similar to that of the radius but is  slightly larger. Posteriorly, there is a short, broad expansion  resembling the entepicondyle of the humerus, and even more nearly like  the postaxial flanges in a crossopterygian fin.    The ends of the radiale are expanded and rounded, the entire bone being  approximately twice as long as wide. The three sides of the intermedium  are similarly convex. The surface of this bone is unfinished, showing  that it must have been embedded in cartilage. The ulnare is  conspicuously similar to the ulna in bearing a posterior hooklike  expansion, and is larger than the radiale.    The four metacarpals are slightly expanded proximally and distally.  Although measurements of length and width are tabulated below (Table  2), we are not certain of the sequence of these bones in the row.    The dimensions of the two proximal phalanges are alike. The shape of  these elements is similar to that of the metacarpals. The two terminal  phalanges are somewhat triangular in shape, the lateral edges being  concave and the proximal convex.

Although we are unable to separate, by sutures, the vomers from the  palatines, the palatal surface of these bones and of the pterygoids is  studded by numerous small teeth, as in Rhipidistia (Jarvik, 1954) and  some of the early Amphibia (Romer, 1947). The stapes apparently reaches  the quadrate, and could therefore serve in hyostylic suspension of the  upper jaw.    The pectoral limb has an axial series of bones carrying hooklike  flanges on their posterior edges. The other bones of the limb show  little modification of form beyond the nearly flat, aquatic type seen  in Rhipidistia. No distinct elbow or wrist joints are developed.    Characters of _Hesperoherpeton_ common to most primitive Amphibia, in  contrast with Crossopterygii, are: Nares separated from edge of jaw;  stapes having external process that may have met a tympanic membrane,  thus giving the bone a sound-transmitting function. Apparently none of  the opercular series was present.    There are two large palatal teeth, slightly labyrinthine in character,  adjacent to each internal naris. The scapulocoracoid, as shown by  Peabody (1958), is Anthracosaurian in structure, as are the  long-stemmed clavicles. The limbs have digits rather than fin-lobes,  although the digital number apparently is four and the number of bones  in the manus is less than would be expected in a primitive amphibian.  The vertebrae are similar to those of Ichthyostegids, as described by  Jarvik (1952), except that the pleurocentra are much larger.    In addition to this remarkable combination of crossopterygian and  amphibian characters, _Hesperoherpeton_ is specialized in certain  features of the skull. The orbits are much enlarged, probably in  correlation with the diminutive size of the animal, and this has been  accompanied by loss of several bones. The frontal and squamosal nearly  meet each other, and both form part of the rim of the orbit. The bones  of the posterior part of the dermal roof are greatly reduced, and there  is none behind the squamosal except the projecting tabular; there is no  indication of quadratojugal, jugal, intertemporal or postparietal. The  foramen magnum is enormous. The external surfaces of the bones of the  skull are nearly smooth.    Is it possible that the \"primitive\" and \"specialized\" features of this  animal are actually larval? Are they not just the kind of characters  that would be expected in an immature, aquatic embolomere of  Pennsylvanian time? For several reasons we do not think this is the  case. Except for the anterior part of the braincase, there is no  indication that the skeleton was not well ossified. The postaxial  processes on the humerus, ulna and ulnare could scarcely have been  larval features only, since they are so clearly homologous with those  in adult Rhipidistia; a larval limb should indeed be simple, but its  simplicity is unlikely to involve paleotelic adult characters. The  scapulocoracoid of our specimen is of practically the same shape and  size as that in the only other known individual, the type; this would  be probable if both were adults, but somewhat less likely if they were  larvae of a much larger animal. The form of the stapes, tabular and  otic notch suggest a functional tympanic membrane, which could not have  occurred in a gill-breathing larva. On the other hand, an adult animal  of pigmy size might be expected to have large orbits, large otic  capsules and a large foramen magnum.    We conclude that _Hesperoherpeton_ lived and sought food in the weedy  shallows at the margin of a pond or lagoon, and that for much of the  time its head was partly out of water (Fig. 12). The animal could  either steady itself or crawl around by means of the paddlelike limbs,  but these probably could not be used in effective locomotion on land.  Like the Ichthyostegids, it probably swam by means of a fishlike tail.    [Illustration: FIG. 12. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Probable  appearance in life. x 0.5.]      TAXONOMY    Evidently _Hesperoherpeton_ is a small, lagoon-dwelling survivor of  the Devonian forms that initiated the change from Crossopterygii to  Amphibia (Jarvik, 1955). It shows, however, that this transition did  not affect all structures at the same time, for some, as the braincase  with its notochordal canal, the mandibular bones and axial limb bones,  are unchanged from the condition normal for the Rhipidistia, but most  other characters are of amphibian grade. To express these facts  taxonomically requires that _Hesperoherpeton_ be removed from the  family Cricotidae, suborder Embolomeri, order Anthracosauria, and  placed in a new order and family of labyrinthodont Amphibia.
