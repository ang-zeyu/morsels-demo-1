Despite the fact that he was an advanced political thinker, he taught  his students to respect the law. He was the poetical evangelist of the  humble, of the unfortunate, and of the physically venturesome. He sang  of the cravings of the soul, of the problems of existence, of Christian  acceptation, of the glory of Italy and the accomplishments of her sons.    Posterity, however, is whispering that the name most worthy to be  bracketed with Carducci is Gabriele D'Annunzio. I shall consider him in  another chapter.    There is a name in the literary annals of this period that is steadily  gaining claim to immortality. It is Giovanni Verga, the chief exponent  of the Veristic school, who was born at Catania in 1840 and is still  living. Although it is the opinion of those who are competent to judge  that his fame as a novelist is greater than that of Fogazzaro, it may  truthfully be said that he is scarcely known beyond the confines of  Italy, and even there his romances have not had the reception that they  deserve. A few years ago when I asked for a copy of \"Mastro-don  Gesualdo\" in the leading bookshop of Palermo and was not successful in  obtaining it, the young man with whom I talked assured me that Zuccoli  would prove to be a satisfactory substitute for Verga. If he is known at  all in this country, it is as the author of the play entitled  \"Cavalleria Rusticana,\" upon which was composed the popular opera. He  has not been a very prolific writer--eight romances, half a dozen  volumes of short stories, and a few plays. He got the material for many  of his short stories in central and northern Italy, but most of his  romances are of his native Sicily, and the pictures of life in the  little villages and towns in the houses of the passionate peasants, in  the huts of the poverty-stricken shepherds, in the hovels of the  adventurous fishermen, and the crumbling palaces of the decayed nobles  are so realistic, so true to life, so almost photographically depicted,  that the reader feels that they are mediated by his own senses. Verga  has the supreme faculty of creating men and women that the reader has  met or would like to meet.    If realism consists in depicting people as they are and particularly  people who are battling with the stern realities of life--poverty,  illness, passions--then Verga is a great realist. The best of his  romances, though not the most popular, are \"I Malavoglia\" and  \"Mastro-don Gesualdo.\" \"Tigre Reale\" had the greatest popularity, and  the \"Storia di una Capinera\" (\"The Story of a Black-hood Novice\"), the  most ardently romantic of all romantic stories, and \"Il Marito di Elena\"  (\"The Husband of Helen\") were widely read.    \"I Malavoglia\" and \"Mastro-don Gesualdo\" were to have been succeeded by  a third volume which would complete the story of the characters unfolded  in them, but it never appeared. When we recall that only eight thousand  copies of the former have been sold in forty years, we readily  understand the artist's discouragement. Posterity is likely to link  Verga's name with Leopardi and Manzoni.    The great romance-writer of Italy during the days of her resurrection  was Manzoni. During the first and second generations of Italy's unity  the mantle of his greatness was worn gracefully and becomingly by  Antonio Fogazzaro (1842-1911). Born at Vicenza, he had the bringing-up  and education of a gentleman. His best-known books are \"Daniele Cortis,\"  \"Piccolo Moderno Mondo\" (\"The Little Modern World\"), \"Piccolo Mondo  Antico\" (\"The Little Antique World\"), and \"Il Santo\" (\"The Saint\").  \"Daniele Cortis\" is generally believed to reveal Fogazzaro's moral,  religious, and political convictions. It is a series of interesting  pictures of intimate life in the upper circles and reveals the mental  development of a man of high principles, the skeleton in whose closet is  a mother who, having side-stepped the paths of morality in her youth,  and who was lost to her son for several years, thrusts herself upon him  the very day when he has his feet securely set on the ladder whose apex  is a brilliant political career. His struggles between duty to his  mother and obligations to his country, his desire not to offend  convention or outrage morality, his love for his cousin Eleana, tame for  him but consuming to her, unhappily married to a Sicilian roue brute and  baron, are narrated in a way that seduces even the casual reader. Indeed  it is wonderfully done, and attention is sustained to the end, virtue  being finally rewarded.    \"The Saint\" is a psychological study of abnormal religious development.  It presented forcibly the necessity for reform of the Vatican and  ecclesiastical customs and beliefs. When it was put on the Index it  caused its illustrious author, a fervent believer and an exemplary  communicant, much pain and remorse. \"Leila\" continued the history of the  leading character of \"The Saint.\" It is said that the author hoped it  would make amends for the offense that the latter had given, but it was  also put on the Index.    He wrote a volume of poetry, and many of his verses are redolent of  music and charm, such as \"Ultima Rosa\" (\"The Last Rose\") and \"Amorum.\"  He has been more widely read in this country than any Italian writer of  fiction save D'Annunzio. He raised one slab to his memory which will  resist more than granite--\"Piccolo Mondo Antico.\" It will be preserved  by time, and cherished for the same reason that one keeps and lauds a  marvellous picture of wife or mother, brother or sweetheart, because it  is a bit of perfection and because the owner loves it.    An extraordinary figure in Italian literature of yesterday and of the  period under discussion, was Olindo Guerrini (1845-1916), for many years  director of the University Library at Bologna. In 1878 he published a  volume entitled \"Postuma\" which purported to be the work of one Lorenzo  Stecchetti which caused prudish Italy to shiver, prurient Italy to  shake, and literary Italy to be enormously diverted. The \"Postuma\" went  through thirty-two editions in forty years, but one should not inquire  too closely the reason for this. When critics discovered that the author  was alive they assailed his immodest verses, and his responses \"Nova  Polemica\" added to his literary reputation. But it was not until he  published his prose writings that he displayed his real literary  stature.    \"Postuma\" is still read, that the reader may find something recent to  compare with the conduct of Messalina rather than for its literary  qualities. \"Rime,\" which has no panoplied display of the author's libido  but many charming idyls, reminiscences, and vignettes is much read  to-day. Such poems as \"Il Guado\" (\"The Ford\") and \"Nell' Aria\" are as  redolent of sentiment and ingenuous experiences that lead to thrills as  a rose is redolent of perfume. Every schoolgirl can quote the last two  lines of the latter:        \"Ed io che intesi quel che non dicevi      M'innamorai di te perche tacevi.\"    Other poems such as \"Congedo\" (\"Leave-taking\") and \"Wienerblut,\" after  the waltz of Johann Strauss, had great popularity at the time and were  praised by his contemporaries, but to-day it is difficult to find great  merit in them. Were one called upon to make specific comment upon his  poetry, he would have to point out the very obvious influence of Byron,  De Musset, and Heine, and to say that Guerrini in no way is comparable  with any of them. Much has been written about him as the index of the  revolt against the corrupt romanticism of the third romantic period in  Italy. He was the uncompromising foe of cant and hypocrisy in literature  and the stanch defender of realism.    Giuseppe Lipparini, an eminently fair critic, gives him a higher rating  as a writer of prose than of poetry. These include \"Vita di Giulio  Cesare Croce\" (\"Life of Julius Caesar Croce\"), a monograph on Francesco  Patuzio, and \"Bibliografia per ridere\" (\"The Laugher's Library\").    Although there were countless poets of this period, two or three should  be mentioned, more because of the effect they had upon the public taste,  perhaps one might say public education, than for the intrinsic merit of  their writings; and of these may be mentioned Vittorio Betteloni  (1840-1910), the son of a romantic poet. His writings may be said to  have popularized the public protest against the romanticism of the third  romantic period. He also made known to many of his countrymen the poetry  of Byron and of Goethe in faithful poetic translations.    Brief mention is here made of two literary men of affairs in Italy, the  purpose being more to call attention to a type of individual who is more  often found in Italy than in any other country--the versatile,  many-sided, cultivated man of affairs who has also distinctive literary  talent.    Enrico Panzacchi (1841-1904) published a volume of lyrics, fluid,  harmonious, transparent, treating of homely, every-day subjects which  appealed very much to the public. He first became known as a writer of  seductive romances, then as an accomplished musician, afterward as a  lyric poet, then as a critic of literature, aesthetics, and philosophy.  He taught the philosophy and history of art; he was the secretary of the  Academy of Belle Arti at Bologna, for many years a deputy in Parliament,  and at one time undersecretary of state and an orator of great renown.  His reputation as a poet depends largely upon \"Cor Sincerum,\" published  in 1902. In his versatility he reminds of Remy de Gourmont, although his  literary productions were incomparably less numerous, but in temper of  mind, literary equipment, aesthetic appetite, and general virtuosity"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41958"],[0,"The Microscope (#4)"],[1,"every description of light, direct and oblique, as  a transparent object and as an opaque object, with strong and with  faint light, with large angular pencils and with small angular pencils  thrown in all possible directions. Every change will probably develop  some new fact in reference to the structure of the object, which  should itself be varied in the mode of mounting in every possible way.  It should be seen both wet and dry, and immersed in fluids of various  qualities and densities, such as water, alcohol, oil, and Canada  balsam, for instance, which last has a refractive power nearly equal  to that of glass. If the object be delicate vegetable tissue, it will  be in some respects rendered more visible by gentle heating or  scorching by a clear fire placed between two plates of glass. In this  way the spiral vessels of asparagus and other similar vegetables may  be beautifully displayed. Dyeing the objects in tincture of iodine  will in some cases answer this purpose better.    But the principal question in regard to illumination is the magnitude  of the illuminating pencil, particularly in reference to transparent  objects. Generally speaking the illuminating pencil should be as large  as can be received by the lens, and no larger. Any light beyond this  produces indistinctness and glare. The superfluous light from the  mirror may be cut off by a screen having various-sized apertures  placed below the stage; but the best mode of illumination is that  proposed by Dr. Wollaston, and called the Wollaston condenser. A tube  is placed below the stage of the instrument containing a lens A B  (Fig. 11), which can be elevated or depressed within certain limits at  pleasure; and at the lower end is a stop with a limited aperture C D.  A plane mirror E F receives the rays of light L L from the sky or a  white cloud, which last is the best source of light, and reflects them  upwards through the aperture in C D, so that they are refracted, and  form an image of the aperture at G, which is supposed to be nearly  the place of the object. The object is sometimes best seen when the  image of the aperture is also best seen; and sometimes it is best to  elevate the summit G of the cone A B G above the object, and at others  to depress it below: all which is done at pleasure by the power of  moving the lens A B. If artifical light (as a lamp or candle) be  employed, the flame must be placed in the principal focus of a large  detached lens on a stand, so that the rays L L may fall in parallel  lines on the mirror, or as they would fall from the cloud. This will  be found an advantage, not only when the Wollaston condenser is  employed, but also when the mirror and diaphragm are used. A good mode  of imitating artificially the light of a white cloud opposite the sun  has been proposed by Mr. Varley; he covers the surface of the mirror  under the stage with carbonate of soda or any similar material, and  then concentrates the sun's light upon its surface by a large  condensing lens. The intense white light diffused from the surface of  the soda forms an excellent substitute for the white cloud, which,  when opposite the sun, and of considerable size, is the best daylight,  as the pure sky opposite to the sun is the worst.    [Illustration: Fig. 11.]    _The Compound Microscope_ may, as before stated, consist of only two  lenses, while a simple microscope has been shown to contain sometimes  three. In the triplet for the simple microscope, however, it was  explained that the effect of the two first lenses was to do what might  have been accomplished, though not so well, by one; and the third  merely effected certain modifications in the light before it entered  the eye. But in the compound microscope the two lenses have totally  different functions; the first receives the rays from the object, and,  bringing them to new foci, forms an image, which the second lens  treats as an original object, and magnifies it just as the single  microscope magnified the object itself.    [Illustration: Fig. 12.]    The annexed figure (12) shows the course of the rays through a  compound microscope of two lenses. The rays proceeding from the object  A B are so acted upon by the lens C D, near it, and thence called the  object glass, that they are converged to foci in A' B', where they  form an enlarged image of the object, as would be evident if a piece  of oiled paper or ground glass were placed there to receive them. They  are not so intercepted, and therefore the image is not rendered  visible at that place; but their further progress is similar to what  it would have been had they really proceeded from an object at A' B'.  They are at length received by the eye-lens L M, which acts upon them  as the simple microscope has been described to act on the light  proceeding from its objects. They are bent so that they may enter the  eye at E in parallel lines, or as nearly so as is requisite for  distinct vision. When we say that the rays enter the eye in nearly  parallel lines, we mean only those which proceed from one point of the  original object. Thus the two parallel rays M E have proceeded from  and are part of the cone of rays C A D, emanating from the point A of  the arrow; but they do not form two pictures in the eye, because any  number of parallel rays which the pupil can receive will be converged  to a point by the eye, and will convey the impression of one point to  the mind. In like manner the rays L E are part of the cone of rays  emanating from B, and the angle L E M is that under which the eye will  see the magnified image of the arrow, which is evidently many times  greater than the arrow could be made to occupy in the naked eye at any  distance within the limits of distinct vision. The magnifying power  depends on two circumstances: first, on the ratio between the anterior  distance A C or B D and the posterior focal length C B' or D A'; and  secondly, on the power of the eye-lens L M. The first ratio is the  same as that between the object A B and the image A' B'; this and the  focal length or power of the eye lens are both easily obtained, and  their product is the power of the compound instrument.    Since the power depends on the ratio between the anterior and  posterior foci of the object-glass, it is evident that by increasing  that ratio any power may be obtained, the same eye-glass being used;  or having determined the first, any further power may be obtained by  increasing that of the eye-glass; and thus, by a pre-arrangement of  the relative proportions in which the magnifying power shall be  divided between the object-glass and the eye-glass, almost any given  distance (within certain limits) between the first and its object may  be secured. This is one valuable peculiarity of the compound  instrument; and another is the large field, or large angle of view,  which may be obtained, every part of which will be nearly equally  good; whereas with the best simple microscopes the field is small, and  is good only in the centre. The field of the compound instrument is  further increased by using two glasses at the eye-end; the first being  called, from its purpose, the field-glass, and the two constituting  what is called the eye-piece. This will be more particularly explained  in the figure of the achromatic compound microscope presently given.    For upwards of a century the compound microscope, notwithstanding the  advantages above mentioned, was a comparatively feeble and inefficient  instrument, owing to the distance which the light had to traverse, and  the consequent increase of the chromatic and spherical aberrations. To  explain this we have drawn in Fig. 12 a second image near A' B', the  fact being that the object-glass would not form one image, as has been  supposed, but an infinite number of variously-colored and  various-sized images, occupying the space between the two dotted  arrows. Those nearest the object-glass would be red, and those nearest  the eye-glass would be blue. The effect of this is to produce so much  confusion, that the instrument was reduced to a mere toy, although  these errors were diminished to the utmost possible extent by limiting  the aperture of the object-glass, and thus restricting the angle of  the pencil of light from each point of the object. But this involved  the defects, already explained, of making the picture obscure, so that  on the whole the best compound instruments were inferior to the simple  microscopes of a single lens, with which, indeed, all the important  observations of the last century were made.    Even after the improvement of the simple microscope by the use of  doublets and triplets, the long course of the rays, and the large  angular pencil required in the compound instrument, deterred the most  sanguine from anticipating the period when they should be conducted  through such a path free both from spherical and chromatic errors.  Within twenty years of the present period, philosophers of no less  eminence than M. Blot and Dr. Wollaston predicted that the compound  would never rival the simple microscope, and that the idea of  achromatizing its object-glass was hopeless. Nor can these opinions be  wondered at when we consider how many years the achromatic telescope  had existed without an attempt to apply its principles to the compound  microscope. When we consider the smallness of the pencil required by  the telescope, and the enormous increase of difficulty attending every  enlargement of the pencil--when we consider further that these  difficulties had to be contended with and removed by operations on  portions of glass so small that they are themselves almost microscopic  objects, we shall not be surprised that even a cautious philosopher  and most able manipulator like Dr. Wollaston should prescribe limits  to improvement.    Fortunately for science, and especially for the departments of animal  and vegetable physiology, these predictions have"]]]
