The travellers, on arriving at Croyland, were warmly welcomed.    \"I heard, brother,\" the abbot said, \"that you had bravely fought  against the Danes near Thetford, and have been sorely anxious since the  news came of the dispersal of your force.\"    \"I have been in hiding,\" Eldred said, \"hoping that a general effort  would be made against the invaders. My own power was broken, since all  my lands are in their hands. The people of East Anglia foolishly seem  to suppose that, so long as the Danes remain quiet, the time has not  come for action. They will repent their lethargy some day, for, as the  Danes gather in strength, they will burst out over the surrounding  country as a dammed-up river breaks its banks. No, brother, I regard  East Anglia as lost so far as depends upon itself; its only hope is in  the men of Kent and Wessex, whom we must now look upon as our  champions, and who may yet stem the tide of invasion and drive back the  Danes. This abbey of yours stands in a perilous position, being not far  removed from the Humber, where so many of the Danes find entrance to  England.\"    \"It is not without danger, Eldred, but the men of the fens are  numerous, hardy and brave, and will offer a tough resistance to any who  may venture to march hitherward, and if, as I hope, you will stay with  us, and will undertake their command, we may yet for a long time keep  the Danes from our doors.\"    For some weeks the time passed quietly. Edmund spent most of his time  in hunting, being generally accompanied by Egbert. The Saxon was an  exceedingly tall and powerful man, slow and scanty of speech, who had  earned for himself the title of Egbert the Silent. He was devoted to  his kinsmen and regarded himself as special guardian of Edmund. He had  instructed him in the use of arms, and always accompanied him when he  went out to hunt the boar, standing ever by his side to aid him to  receive the rush of the wounded and furious beasts; and more than once,  when Edmund had been borne down by their onslaughts, and would have  been severely wounded, if not killed, a sweeping blow of Egbert's sword  had rid him of his assailant.    Sometimes Edmund made excursions in the fens, where with nets and  snares he caught the fish which swarmed in the sluggish waters; or,  having covered his boat with a leafy bower until it resembled a  floating bush, drifted close to the flocks of wild-fowl, and with his  bow and arrows obtained many a plump wild duck. Smaller birds were  caught in snares or traps, or with bird-lime smeared on twigs. Eldred  seldom joined his son in his hunting excursions, as he was busied with  his brother the abbot in concerting the measures of defence and in  organizing a band of messengers, who, on the first warning of danger,  could be despatched throughout the fens to call in the fisher  population to the defence of the abbey.    It was on the 18th of September, 870, that a messenger arrived at the  abbey and craved instant speech with the prior. The latter, who was  closeted with his brother, ordered the man to be admitted.    \"I come,\" he said, \"from Algar the ealdorman. He bids me tell you that  a great Danish host has landed from the Humber at Lindsay. The rich  monastery of Bardenay has been pillaged and burned. Algar is assembling  all the inhabitants of the marsh lands to give them battle, and he  prays you to send what help you can spare, for assuredly they will  march hither should he be defeated.\"    \"Return to the ealdorman,\" the abbot said; \"tell him that every lay  brother and monk who can bear arms shall march hence to join him under  the command of lay brother Toley, whose deeds of arms against the Danes  in Mercia are well known to him. My brother here, Eldred, will head all  the inhabitants of the marshes of this neighbourhood. With these and  the brothers of the abbey, in all, as I reckon, nigh four hundred men,  he will to-morrow march to join Algar.\"    Messengers were at once sent off through the surrounding country  bidding every man assemble on the morrow morning at Croyland, and soon  after daybreak they began to arrive. Some were armed with swords, some  with long sickles, used in cutting rushes, tied to poles, some had  fastened long pieces of iron to oars to serve as pikes. They were a  rough and somewhat ragged throng, but Eldred saw with satisfaction that  they were a hard and sturdy set of men, accustomed to fatigue and  likely to stand firm in the hour of battle.    Most of them carried shields made of platted osiers covered with skin.  The armoury of the abbey was well supplied, and swords and axes were  distributed among the worst armed of the fenmen. Then, with but little  order or regularity, but with firm and cheerful countenances, as men  determined to win or die, the band moved off under Eldred's command,  followed by the contingent of the abbey, eighty strong, under lay  brother Toley.    A sturdy band were these monks, well fed and vigorous. They knew that  they had no mercy to expect from the Danes, and, regarding them as  pagans and enemies of their religion as well as of their country, could  be trusted to do their utmost. Late that evening they joined Algar at  the place they had appointed, and found that a large number of the  people of the marshes had gathered round his banner.    The Danes had not moved as yet from Bardenay, and Algar determined to  wait for another day or two before advancing, in order to give time to  others farther from the scene of action to arrive.    The next day came the contingents from several other priories and  abbeys, and the sight of the considerable force gathered together gave  heart and confidence to all. Algar, Eldred, and the other leaders,  Morcar, Osgot, and Harding, moved about among the host, encouraging  them with cheering words, warning them to be in no way intimidated by  the fierce appearance of the Danes, but to hold steadfast and firm in  the ranks, and to yield no foot of ground to the onslaught of the  enemy. Many priests had accompanied the contingents from the religious  houses, and these added their exhortations to those of the leaders,  telling the men that God would assuredly fight on their side against  the heathen, and bidding each man remember that defeat meant the  destruction of their churches and altars, the overthrow of their whole  religion, and the restored worship of the pagan gods.    Edmund went about among the gathering taking great interest in the wild  scene, for these marsh men differed much in their appearance from the  settled inhabitants of his father's lands. The scenes in the camp were  indeed varied in their character. Here and there were harpers with  groups of listeners gathered round, as they sung the exploits of their  fathers, and animated their hearers to fresh fire and energy by  relating legends of the cruelty of the merciless Danes. Other groups  there were surrounding the priests, who were appealing to their  religious feelings as well as to their patriotism.    Men sat about sharpening their weapons, fixing on more firmly the  handles of their shields, adjusting arrows to bowstrings, and preparing  in other ways for the coming fight. From some of the fires, round which  the marsh men were sitting, came snatches of boisterous song, while  here and there, apart from the crowd, priests were hearing confessions,  and shriving penitents.    The next morning early, one of the scouts, who had been sent to observe  the movements of the Danes, reported that these were issuing from their  camp, and advancing into the country.    Algar marshalled his host, each part under its leaders, and moved to  meet them. Near Kesteven the armies came in sight of each other, and  after advancing until but a short distance apart both halted to marshal  their ranks anew. Eldred, with the men of the marshes near Croyland and  the contingent from the abbey, had their post in the central division,  which was commanded by Algar himself, Edmund took post by his father,  and Egbert stood beside him.    Edmund had never before seen the Danes, and he could not but admit that  their appearance was enough to shake the stoutest heart. All carried  great shields covering them from head to foot. These were composed of  wood, bark, or leather painted or embossed, and in the cases of the  chiefs plated with gold and silver. So large were these that in naval  encounters, if the fear of falling into the enemy's hands forced them  to throw themselves into the sea, they could float on their shields;  and after death in battle a soldier was carried to his grave on his  buckler. As they stood facing the Saxons they locked their shields  together so as to form a barrier well-nigh impregnable against the  arrows.    All wore helmets, the common men of leather, the leaders of iron or  copper, while many in addition wore coats of mail. Each carried a  sword, a battle-axe, and a bow and arrows. Some of the swords were  short and curled like a scimitar; others were long and straight, and  were wielded with both hands. They wore their hair long and hanging  down their shoulders, and for the most part shaved their cheeks and  chins, but wore their moustaches very long.    They were, for the most, tall, lithe, and sinewy men, but physically in  no way superior to the Saxons, from whom they differed very widely in  complexion, the Saxons being fair while the Danes were very dark, as  much so as modern gypsies; indeed, the Saxon historians speak of them  as the black pagans. Upon the other hand many of the Northmen, being  Scandinavians, were as fair as the Saxons themselves.    The Danes began the battle, those in front shouting fiercely, and  striking their swords on their shields with a clashing noise, while the  ranks behind shot a shower of arrows among the Saxons. These at once  replied."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36764"],[0,"In the Track of the Bookworm (#4)"],[1,"seems to  be an unwonted occupation for negro slaves.

It is a serious question whether the art of printing has been improved  except in facility. Is not the first printed book still the finest ever  printed? But in one point I am certain that the moderns have fallen away,  at least in the production of cheap books, and that is in the quality and  finish of the paper. Not to speak of injurious devices to make the book  heavy, the custom of calendering the paper, or making it smooth and shiny,  practised by some important publishers, is bad for the eyes, and the  result is not pleasant to look at. It is like the glare of the glass over  the framed print. It is said to be necessary to the production of the  modern \"process\" pictures. Even here however there is a just mean, for  some of the modern paper is absurdly rough, and very difficult for a good  impression of the types. Modern paper however has one advantage: Mr.  Blades, in his pleasant \"Enemies of Books,\" tells us \"that the worm will  not touch it,\" it is so adulterated. One hint I would give the  publishers--allow us a few more fly leaves, so that we may paste in  newspaper cuttings, and make memoranda and suggestions.    It is predicted by some that our nineteenth century books--at least those  of the last third--will not last; that the paper and ink are far inferior  to those of preceding centuries, and that the destroying tooth of time  will work havoc with them. No doubt the modern paper and the modern ink  are inferior to those of the earlier ages of printing, when making a book  was a fine art and a work of conscience, but whether the modern  productions of the press will ultimately fade and crumble is a question to  be determined only by a considerable lapse of time, which probably no one  living will be qualified to pronounce upon. Take for what they are worth  my sentiments respecting      THE FAILING BOOKS.      They say our books will disappear,      That ink will fade and paper rot--    I sha'n't be here,      So I don't care a jot.      The best of them I know by heart,      As for the rest they make me tired;    The viler part      May well be fired.      Oh, what a hypocritic show      Will be the bibliomaniac's hoard!    Cheat as hollow      As a backgammon board.      Just think of Lamb without his stuffing,      And the iconoclastic Howells,    Who spite of puffing      Is destitute of bowels.      'Twould make me laugh to see the stare      Of mousing bibliomaniac fond    At pages bare      As Overreach's bond.      Those empty titles will displease      The earnest student seeking knowledge,--    Barren degrees,      Like these of Western College.      That common stuff, \"Excelsior,\"      In poetry so lacking,    I care not for--      'Tis only fit for packing.    It has occurred to me that publishers might appeal to bibliomaniacal  tastes by paying a little more attention to their paper, and I have thrown  a few suggestions on this point into rhyme, so that they may be readily  committed to memory:      SUITING PAPER TO SUBJECT.      Printers the paper should adapt      Unto the subject of the book,    Thus making buyers wonder-rapt      Before they at the contents look.      Thus Beerbohm's learned book on Eggs      On a laid paper he should print,    But Motley's \"Dutch Republic\" begs      Rice paper should its matter hint.      That curious problem of what Man      Inhabited the Iron Mask    Than Whatman paper never can      A more suggestive medium ask.      The \"Book of Dates,\" by Mr. Haydon,      Should be on paper calendered;    That Swift on Servants be arrayed on      A hand-made paper is inferred.      Though angling-books have never been      Accustomed widely to appear    On fly-paper, 'twould be no sin      To have them wormed from front to rear.      The good that authors thus may reap      I'll not pursue to tedium,    But hint, for books on raising sheep      Buckram is just the medium.          VII.    WOMEN AS COLLECTORS.      Women collect all sorts of things except books. To them the book-sense  seems to be denied, and it is difficult for them to appreciate its  existence in men. To be sure, there have been a few celebrated  book-collectors among the fair sex, but they have usually been rather  reprehensible ladies, like Diane de Poictiers and Madame Pompadour.  Probably Aspasia was a collector of MSS. Lady Jane Grey seems to have been  a virtuous exception, and she was cruelly \"cropped.\" I am told that there  are a few women now-a-days who collect books, and only a few weeks ago a  lady read, before a woman's club in Chicago, a paper on the Collection and  Adornment of Books, for which occasion a fair member of the club solicited  me to write her something appropriate to read, which of course I was glad  to do. But this was in Chicago, where the women go in for culture. In  thirty years' haunting of the book-shops and print-shops of New York, I  have never seen a woman catching a cold in her head by turning over the  large prints, nor soiling her dainty gloves by handling the dirty old  books. Women have been depicted in literature in many different  occupations, situations and pleasures, but in all the literature that I  have read I can recall only one instance in which she is imagined a  book-buyer. This is in \"The Sentimental Journey,\" and in celebrating the  unique instance let me rise to a nobler strain and sing a song of      THE SENTIMENTAL CHAMBERMAID.      When you're in Paris, do not fail      To seek the Quai de Conti,    Where in the roguish Parson's tale,      Upon the river front he    Bespoke the pretty chambermaid    Too innocent to be afraid.      On this book-seller's mouldy stall,      Crammed full of volumes musty,    I made a bibliophilic call      And saw, in garments rusty,    The ancient vender, queer to view,    In breeches, buckles, and a queue.      And while to find that famous book,      \"Les Egaremens du Coeur,\"    I dilligently undertook,      I suddenly met her;    She held a small green satin purse,    And spite of Time looked none the worse.      I told her she was known to Fame      Through ministerial Mentor,    And though I had not heard her name,      That this should not prevent her    From listening to the homage due    To one to Sentiment so true.      She blushed; I bowed in courtly fashion;      In pockets of my trousers    Then sought a crown to vouch my passion,      Without intent to rouse hers;    But I had left my purse 'twould seem--    And then I woke--'twas but a dream!      The heart will wander, never doubt,      Though waking faith it keep;    That is exceptionally stout      Which strays but in its sleep;    And hearts must always turn to her      Who loved, \"Les Egaremens du Coeur.\"    M. Uzanne, in \"The Book-Hunter in Paris,\" avers that \"the woman of fashion  never goes book-hunting,\" and he puts the aphorism in italics. He also  says that the occasional woman at the book-stalls, \"if by chance she wants  a book, tries to bargain for it as if it were a lobster or a fowl.\" Also  that the book-stall keepers are always watchful of the woman with an  ulster, a water-proof, or a muff. These garments are not always impervious  to books, it seems.    The imitative efforts of women at \"extra-illustrating\" are usually limited  to buying a set of photographs at Rome and sticking them into the cracks  of \"The Marble Faun,\" and giving it away to a friend as a marked favor.  Poor Hawthorne! he would wriggle in his grave if he could see his fair  admirers doing this. Mr. Blades certainly ought to have included women  among the enemies of books. They generally regard the husband's or  father's expenditure on books as so much spoil of their gowns and jewels.  We book-men are up to all the tricks of getting the books into the house  without their knowing it. What joy and glee when we successfully smuggle  in a parcel from the express, right under our wife's nose, while she is  busy talking scandal to another woman in the drawing-room! The good  creatures make us positively dishonest and endanger our eternal welfare.  How we \"hustle around\" in their absence, when the embargo is temporarily  raised; and when the new purchases are detected, how we pretend that they  are old, and wonder that they have not seen them before, and rattle away  in a fevered, embarrassed manner about the scarcity and value of the  surreptitious purchases, and how meanly conscious we are all the time that  the pretense is unavailing and the fair despots see right through us.  God has given them an instinct that is more than a match for our  acknowledged superior intellect. And the good wife smiles quietly but  satirically, and says, in the form in that case made and provided, \"My  dear, you'll certainly ruin yourself buying books!\" with a sigh that  agitates a very costly diamond necklace reposing on her shapely bosom; or  she archly shakes at us a warning finger all aglow with ruby and sapphire,  which she has bought on installments out of the house allowance. Fortunate  for us if the library is not condemned to be cleaned twice a year. These  beloved objects ought to deny themselves a ring, or a horse, or a gown, or  a ball now and then, to atone for their mankind's debauchery in books; but  do they? They ought to encourage the Bibliomania, for it keeps their  husbands out of mischief, away from \"that horrid club,\" and safe at home  of evenings. The Book-Worm is always a blameless being. He never has to  hie to Canada as a refuge. He is \"absolutely pure,\" like all the baking  powders.    The gentle Addison, in \"The Spectator,\" thus described a woman's library:  \"The very sound of a lady's library gave me a great curiosity to see it;  and as it was some time before the lady came to me, I had an opportunity  of turning over a great many of her books, which were ranged together in "]]]
