The various permutations of the X-shaped scapular mark  and dark sacral marks differ proportionately in different samples.  The variation in color pattern in 12 samples is summarized in  Table 2. In samples from the southern part of the range (southern  Nicaragua and Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica) more (40-93%)  individuals have the lateral stripes extending to the groin than  in northern samples (0-42%) from southern Mexico and Guatemala.  Likewise, the percentage of specimens lacking bars on the shanks and  a dark interorbital bar is higher in the Costa Rican samples than  elsewhere in the range. The X- or )(-shaped scapular markings and  /\\- or / \\-shaped sacral markings are most prevalent in northern  samples, whereas to the south the dorsal markings are more commonly  arranged in a pattern of paired lines, which usually are discontinuous  and usually extend posteriorly only to the sacral region. Thus, the  color pattern in _H. m. underwoodi_ in the southern part of its range  shows trends towards the pattern characteristic of _H. m.  microcephala_. Intergrades between these two subspecies have  been discussed in the account of the nominate subspecies.

But, as you have varied  three-eighths of the circle, set your compass and travel by it to the  southeast, until, in your judgment, you have about made up the  deviation; then go straight south, and you will not be far wrong. Carry  the compass in your hand and look at it every few minutes; for the  tendency to swerve from a straight course when a man is once lost--and  nearly always to the right--is a thing past understanding.    [Sidenote: Insect Pests]    As regards poisonous insects, it may be said that, to the man with  clean, bleached, tender skin, they are, at the start, an unendurable  torment. No one can enjoy life with a smarting, burning, swollen face,  while the attacks on every exposed inch of skin are persistent and  constant. I have seen a young man after two days' exposure to these  pests come out of the woods with one eye entirely closed and the brow  hanging over it like a clam shell, while face and hands were almost  hideous from inflammation and puffiness. The St. Regis and St. Francis  Indians, although born and reared in the woods, by no means make light  of the black fly.    It took the man who could shoot Phantom Falls to find out, \"Its bite is  not severe, nor is it ordinarily poisonous. There may be an occasional  exception to this rule; but beside the bite of the mosquito, it is  comparatively mild and harmless.\" And again: \"Gnats ... in my way of  thinking, are much worse than the black fly or mosquito.\" So says  Murray. Our observations differ. A thousand mosquitoes and as many gnats  can bite me without leaving a mark, or having any effect save the pain  of the bite while they are at work. But each bite of the black fly makes  a separate and distinct boil, that will not heal and be well in two  months.    While fishing for brook trout in July last, I ran into a swarm of them  on Moose River, and got badly bitten. I had carelessly left my medicine  behind. On the first of October the bites had not ceased to be painful,  and it was three months before they disappeared entirely. Frank Forester  says, in his _Fish and Fishing_, page 371, that he has never fished for  the red-fleshed trout of Hamilton county, \"being deterred therefrom by  dread of that curse of the summer angler, the black fly, which is to me  especially venomous.\"    \"Adirondack Murray\" gives extended directions for beating these little  pests by the use of buckskin gloves with chamois gauntlets, Swiss mull,  fine muslin, etc. Then he advises a mixture of sweet oil and tar, which  is to be applied to face and hands; and he adds that it is easily washed  off, leaving the skin soft and smooth as an infant's; all of which is  true. But, more than forty years' experience in the woods has taught me  that the following recipe is infallible anywhere that _sancudos_,  _moquims_, or our own poisonous insects do most abound.    It was published in _Forest and Stream_ in the summer of 1880, and again  in '83. It has been pretty widely quoted and adopted, and I have never  known it to fail: Three ounces pine tar, two ounces castor oil, one  ounce pennyroyal oil. Simmer all together over a slow fire, and bottle  for use. You will hardly need more than a two-ounce vial full in a  season. One ounce has lasted me six weeks in the woods. Rub it in  thoroughly and liberally at first, and after you have established a good  glaze, a little replenishing from day to day will be sufficient. And  don't fool with soap and towels where insects are plenty. A good safe  coat of this varnish grows better the longer it is kept on--and it is  cleanly and wholesome. If you get your face and hands crocky or smutty  about the camp-fire, wet the corner of your handkerchief and rub it off,  not forgetting to apply the varnish at once, wherever you have cleaned  it off. Last summer I carried a cake of soap and a towel in my knapsack  through the North Woods for a seven weeks' tour, and never used either a  single time. When I had established a good glaze on the skin, it was too  valuable to be sacrificed for any weak whim connected with soap and  water. When I struck a woodland hotel, I found soap and towels plenty  enough. I found the mixture gave one's face the ruddy tanned look  supposed to be indicative of health and hard muscle. A thorough ablution  in the public wash basin reduced the color, but left the skin very soft  and smooth; in fact, as a lotion for the skin it is excellent. It is a  soothing and healing application for poisonous bites already received.    I have given some space to the insect question, but no more than it  deserves or requires. The venomous little wretches are quite important  enough to spoil many a well planned trip to the woods, and it is best to  beat them from the start. You will find that immunity from insects and a  comfortable camp are the two first and most indispensable requisites of  an outing in the woods. And just here I will briefly tell how a young  friend of mine went to the woods, some twenty-five years ago. He was a  bank clerk, and a good fellow withal, with a leaning toward camp-life.    For months, whenever we met, he would introduce his favorite topics,  fishing, camping out, etc. At last in the hottest of the hot months, the  time came. He put in an appearance with a fighting cut on his hair, a  little stiff straw hat, and a soft skin, bleached by long confinement in  a close office. I thought he looked a little tender; but he was  sanguine. He could rough it, could sleep on the bare ground with the  root of a tree for a pillow; as for mosquitoes and punkies, he never  minded them.    [Sidenote: _Beware the Black Fly_]    We went in a party of five--two old hunters and three youngsters, the  latter all enthusiasm and pluck--at first. Toward the last end of a  heavy eight-mile tramp, they grew silent, and slapped and scratched  nervously. Arriving at the camping spot, they worked fairly well, but  were evidently weakening a little. By the time we were ready to turn in  they were reduced pretty well to silence and suffering--especially the  bank clerk, Jean L. The punkies were eager for his tender skin, and they  were rank poison to him. He muffled his head in a blanket and tried to  sleep, but it was only a partial success. When, by suffocating himself,  he obtained a little relief from insect bites, there were stubs and  knotty roots continually poking themselves among his ribs, or digging  into his backbone.    I have often had occasion to observe that stubs, roots and small stones,  etc., have a perverse tendency to abrade the anatomy of people unused to  the woods. Mr. C. D. Warner has noticed the same thing, I believe.    On the whole, Jean and the other youngsters behaved very well. Although  they turned out in the morning with red, swollen faces and half closed  eyes, they all went trouting and caught about 150 small trout between  them. They did their level bravest to make a jolly thing of it; but  Jean's attempt to watch a deerlick, resulted in a wetting through the  sudden advent of a shower; and the shower drove about all the punkies  and mosquitoes in the neighborhood under our roof for shelter. I never  saw them more plentiful or worse. Jean gave in and varnished his pelt  thoroughly with my \"punkie dope,\" as he called it; but, too late; the  mischief was done. And the second trial was worse to those youngsters  than the first. More insects. More stubs and knots. Owing to these  little annoyances, they arrived at home several days before their  friends expected them--leaving enough rations in camp to last Old Sile  and the writer a full week. And the moral of it is, if they had fitted  themselves for the the woods before going there, the trip would have  been a pleasure instead of a misery.    One other little annoyance I will mention, as a common occurrence among  those who camp out; this is the lack of a pillow. I suppose I have  camped fifty times with people, who, on turning in, were squirming  around for a long time, trying to get a rest for the head. Boots are the  most common resort. But, when you place a boot-leg--or two of  them--under your head, they collapse, and make a head-rest less than  half an inch thick. Just why it never occurs to people that a stuffing  of moss, leaves, or hemlock browse, would fill out the bed-leg and make  a passable pillow, is another conundrum I cannot answer. But there is  another and better way of making a pillow for camp use, which I will  describe further on.    And now I wish to devote some space to one of the most important  adjuncts of woodcraft, i.e., camps; how to make them, and how to make  them comfortable. There are camps, and camps. There are camps in the  North Woods that are really fine villas, costing thousands of dollars,  and there are log-houses, and shanties, and bark camps, and A tents, and  walled tents, shelter tents and shanty tents. But, I assume that the  camp best fitted to the wants of the average outer is the one that  combines the essentials of dryness, lightness, portability, cheapness,  and is easily and quickly put up. Another essential is, that it must  admit of a bright fire in front by night or day. I will give short  descriptions of the forest shelters (camps) I have found handiest and  most useful.    Firstly, I will mention a sort of camp that was described in a  sportsman's paper, and has since been largely quoted and used. It is  made by fastening a horizontal pole to a couple of contiguous trees, and  then putting on a heavy covering of hemlock boughs, shingling them with  the tips downward, of course. A fire is to be made at the roots of one  of the trees. This, with plenty of boughs, may be made to stand a pretty  stiff rain; but it is only a damp arbor, and no camp, properly speaking.  A forest camp should always admit of a bright fire in front, with a  lean-to or shed roof overhead, to reflect the fire heat"]]]
