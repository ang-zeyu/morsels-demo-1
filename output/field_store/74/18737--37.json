Thus, while the busy dame  bustled about the house, or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the  piazza, honest Balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other,  watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a  sword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle  of the barn. In the mean time, Ichabod would carry on his suit with the  daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm, or sauntering  along in the twilight, that hour so favorable to the lover's eloquence.    I profess not to know how women's hearts are wooed and won. To me they  have always been matters of riddle and admiration. Some seem to have but  one vulnerable point, or door of access; while others have a thousand  avenues, and may be captured in a thousand different ways. It is a  great triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still greater proof of  generalship to maintain possession of the latter, for man must battle  for his fortress at every door and window. He who wins a thousand common  hearts is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed  sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero. Certain it is, this  was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones; and from the moment  Ichabod Crane made his advances, the interests of the former evidently  declined: his horse was no longer seen tied to the palings on Sunday  nights, and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the preceptor  of Sleepy Hollow.    Brom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature, would fain have  carried matters to open warfare and have settled their pretensions  to the lady, according to the mode of those most concise and simple  reasoners, the knights-errant of yore,--by single combat; but Ichabod  was too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the  lists against him; he had overheard a boast of Bones, that he would  \"double the schoolmaster up, and lay him on a shelf of his own  schoolhouse;\" and he was too wary to give him an opportunity. There was  something extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system; it  left Brom no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in  his disposition, and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival.  Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and his gang  of rough riders. They harried his hitherto peaceful domains; smoked  out his singing school by stopping up the chimney; broke into the  schoolhouse at night, in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe  and window stakes, and turned everything topsy-turvy, so that the poor  schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held  their meetings there. But what was still more annoying, Brom took all  opportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress,  and had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous  manner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod's, to instruct her in  psalmody.    In this way matters went on for some time, without producing any  material effect on the relative situations of the contending powers. On  a fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood, sat enthroned on  the lofty stool from whence he usually watched all the concerns of his  little literary realm. In his hand he swayed a ferule, that sceptre of  despotic power; the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the  throne, a constant terror to evil doers, while on the desk before  him might be seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons,  detected upon the persons of idle urchins, such as half-munched apples,  popguns, whirligigs, fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little  paper gamecocks. Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice  recently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their  books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the  master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the  schoolroom. It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in  tow-cloth jacket and trowsers, a round-crowned fragment of a hat,  like the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back of a ragged, wild,  half-broken colt, which he managed with a rope by way of halter. He came  clattering up to the school door with an invitation to Ichabod to attend  a merry-making or \"quilting frolic,\" to be held that evening at  Mynheer Van Tassel's; and having delivered his message with that air of  importance, and effort at fine language, which a negro is apt to display  on petty embassies of the kind, he dashed over the brook, and was seen  scampering away up the hollow, full of the importance and hurry of his  mission.    All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet schoolroom. The scholars  were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles; those  who were nimble skipped over half with impunity, and those who were  tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear, to quicken their  speed or help them over a tall word. Books were flung aside without  being put away on the shelves, inkstands were overturned, benches thrown  down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual  time, bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing  about the green in joy at their early emancipation.    The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his toilet,  brushing and furbishing up his best, and indeed only suit of rusty  black, and arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that  hung up in the schoolhouse. That he might make his appearance before his  mistress in the true style of a cavalier, he borrowed a horse from the  farmer with whom he was domiciliated, a choleric old Dutchman of the  name of Hans Van Ripper, and, thus gallantly mounted, issued forth like  a knight-errant in quest of adventures. But it is meet I should, in  the true spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks  and equipments of my hero and his steed. The animal he bestrode was  a broken-down plow-horse, that had outlived almost everything but its  viciousness. He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck, and a head like  a hammer; his rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burs;  one eye had lost its pupil, and was glaring and spectral, but the other  had the gleam of a genuine devil in it. Still he must have had fire and  mettle in his day, if we may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder.  He had, in fact, been a favorite steed of his master's, the choleric Van  Ripper, who was a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of  his own spirit into the animal; for, old and broken-down as he looked,  there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in  the country.    Ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed. He rode with short  stirrups, which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle;  his sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers'; he carried his whip  perpendicularly in his hand, like a sceptre, and as his horse jogged on,  the motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings. A  small wool hat rested on the top of his nose, for so his scanty strip of  forehead might be called, and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out  almost to the horses tail. Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his  steed as they shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was  altogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad  daylight.    It was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day; the sky was clear and  serene, and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always  associate with the idea of abundance. The forests had put on their sober  brown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped  by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet.  Streaming files of wild ducks began to make their appearance high in the  air; the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech  and hickory-nuts, and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from  the neighboring stubble field.    The small birds were taking their farewell banquets. In the fullness  of their revelry, they fluttered, chirping and frolicking from bush to  bush, and tree to tree, capricious from the very profusion and variety  around them. There was the honest cock robin, the favorite game of  stripling sportsmen, with its loud querulous note; and the twittering  blackbirds flying in sable clouds; and the golden-winged woodpecker with  his crimson crest, his broad black gorget, and splendid plumage; and the  cedar bird, with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail and its little  monteiro cap of feathers; and the blue jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his  gay light blue coat and white underclothes, screaming and chattering,  nodding and bobbing and bowing, and pretending to be on good terms with  every songster of the grove.    As Ichabod jogged slowly on his way, his eye, ever open to every symptom  of culinary abundance, ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly  autumn. On all sides he beheld vast store of apples; some hanging in  oppressive opulence on the trees; some gathered into baskets and barrels  for the market; others heaped up in rich piles for the cider-press.  Farther on he beheld great fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears  peeping from their leafy coverts, and holding out the promise of cakes  and hasty-pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning  up their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects of  the most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed the fragrant buckwheat  fields breathing the odor of the beehive, and as he beheld them, soft  anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slapjacks, well buttered,  and garnished with honey or treacle, by the delicate little dimpled hand  of Katrina Van Tassel.    Thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and \"sugared  suppositions,\" he journeyed along the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41017"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 5 (of 8) (#4)"],[1," proud of them! and the Boers, too, were       astonished at their courage and endurance. Fired at from three       sides, they never betrayed the least alarm or haste, but coolly       laid their guns and went through their drill as if it had been       a sham-fight, and men and horses were not dropping on all       sides. There was a little bit of cover a hundred yards or so       behind the battery, around the siding and station buildings of       the projected railway and embankment. Thither the living horses       from the limbers and guns were taken, and the wounded were       conveyed. When, three hours later, their ammunition for the       12-pounders was scarce, and the Boer rifle fire from the gulch,       the waggons, and ridge opened heavy and deadly, the gunners       would crawl back and forward for powder and shell. Had it not       been for those terrible cannon, the Boers told me that they       would have charged, closing in on all sides upon Broadwood's       men.\"    [Illustration: THE DISASTER AT KOORNSPRUIT: DRIVERLESS TEAMS STAMPEDING    Drawing by John Charlton]    When the order to retire was received, Major Phipps Hornby ordered the  guns and their limbers to be run back by hand to where the teams of  uninjured horses stood behind the station buildings. Then such gunners  as remained, assisted by the officers and men of the Burma Mounted  Infantry, and directed by Major Phipps Hornby and Captain Humphreys (the  sole remaining officers of the battery), succeeded in running back four  of the guns under shelter. It is said the guns would never have been  saved but for the gallant action of the officers and men of the Burma  Mounted Infantry, who, when nearly every gunner was killed, volunteered,  and succeeded, under the heaviest fire, in dragging the guns back by  hand to a place of safety. It was while doing this that Lieutenant P. C.  Grover, of the Burma Mounted Infantry, was killed. Though one or two of  the limbers were thus valiantly withdrawn under a perfect cyclone of  shot and shell, the exhausted men found it impossible to drag in the  remaining limbers or the fifth gun. Human beings failing, the horses had  also to be risked, and presently several gallant drivers volunteered to  plunge straight into the hellish vortex. They got to work grandly,  though horses dropped in death agony and man after man, hero after hero,  was picked off by the unerring and copious fire of the Dutchmen. It is  difficult to get the names of all the glorious fellows who carried their  lives in their hands on that great but dreadful day, but Gunner Lodge  and Driver Glasock were chosen as the representatives of those who  immortalised themselves and earned the Victoria Cross. Of Bombardier  Gudgeon's magnificent energy enough cannot be said. One after another  teams were shot, but he persisted in his work of getting fresh teams.  Three times he strove to roll a gun to a place of safety, and on the  third occasion was wounded. The splendid discipline of the gunners was  extolled by every eye-witness, and the way the noble fellows, surrounded  with Boer sharpshooters, stood to the guns was so marvellous, so  inspiriting, that even the men who were covering the retirement, at risk  of their lives were impelled to rise and cheer the splendid action of  the glorious remnant. The correspondent of _The Times_ declared that  \"When the order came for the guns to retire, ten men and one officer  alone remained upon their feet, and they were not all unwounded. The  teams were as shattered as the gun groups. Solitary drivers brought up  teams of four--in one case a solitary pair of wheelers was all that  could be found to take a piece away. The last gun was dragged away by  hand until a team could be patched up from the horses that remained. As  the mutilated remnant of two batteries of Horse Artillery tottered  through the line of prone mounted infantry covering its withdrawal, the  men could not restrain their admiration. Though it was to court death to  show a hand, men leaped to their feet and cheered the gunners as they  passed. Seven guns and a baggage train were lost, but the prestige and  honour of the country were saved. Five guns had been extricated. The  mounted infantry had found a line of retreat, and total disaster was  avoided. But the fighting was not over. The extrication of a rearguard  in the front of a victorious and exultant enemy has been a difficult and  a delicate task in the history of all war. In the face of modern weapons  it is fraught with increased difficulties. For two hours Rimington's  Scouts, the New Zealand Mounted Infantry, Roberts's Horse, and the 3rd  Regiment of Mounted Infantry covered each other in retreat, while the  enemy galloped forward and, dismounting, engaged them, often at ranges  up to 300 yards.\"    The force was surrounded by the enemy on all sides, and there was no  resource but to fight through--the cavalry and mounted infantry taking a  line towards a drift on the south. Roberts's Horse made a gallant and  desperate effort to outflank the Dutchmen, and lost heavily; and  Aldersen's Brigade, with magnificent dash and considerable skill,  succeeded in holding back the hostile horde. This retirement was no easy  matter, for the position taken up by the Federals was exceptionally  favourable to them. To the north the spruit twisted in a convenient  hoop, which sheltered them; to the south was the embankment of the  railway in course of construction; from these points and from front and  rear the enemy was able, in comparative security, to batter and harass  the discomfited troops.    Fortunately, in the end, Colvile's Division, which had been making its  way from Bloemfontein, arrived in time to check the Boers in their  jubilant advance, though some hours too late to prevent the enemy from  capturing and removing the waggons and guns.    While the retreat was being effected more valorous work was going on  elsewhere. The members of the Army Medical Corps, with the coolness  peculiar to them, were exposing themselves and rushing to the assistance  of the wounded, many being stricken down in the midst of their splendid  labours. Roberts's Horse made themselves worthy of the noble soldier who  godfathered them, and one--a trooper of the name of Tod--a prodigy of  valour, rode deliberately into the _melee_ in search of the wounded, and  returned with the dead weight of a helpless man in his arms, under the  fierce fire of the foe. If disaster does nothing more, it breeds heroes.  The melancholy affair of Koorn Spruit brought to light the superb  qualities that lie dormant in many who live their lives in the matter of  fact way and give no sign.    Splendid actions followed one another with amazing persistence, man  after man and officer after officer attempting deeds of daring, each of  which in themselves would form the foundation of an heroic tale.  Lieutenant Maxwell of Roberts's Horse, from the very teeth of the enemy  dragged off a wounded man--a lad who, by the time he was rescued, had  fainted. But the young subaltern promptly got him in the saddle, and the  pair sped forth from the fiery zone alive. The Duke of Teck also rushed  to the succour of Lieutenant Meade, who was wounded (a bullet cutting  off his finger and piercing his thigh), gave up to him his horse and  removed him from the scene of danger. At the same time Colonel Pilcher  was gallantly rescuing Corporal Packer of the 1st Life Guards. Major  Booth (Northumberland Fusiliers) lost his life through doggedly holding  a position with four others, in order to cover the retreat.    When the Queenslanders arrived they too showed the stuff they were made  of, the best British thews combined with the doughtiest British hearts.  They plunged into action--so dashingly indeed that the Boers very nearly  mopped them up. But Colonel Henry was equal even to the skittish foe,  and contrived to entertain the Dutchmen by leading them so active a  dance that eventually the Colonials were able to fight out their own  salvation.    At last the guns got away and followed the line of retreat taken by the  cavalry. The troops then conducted their retirement by alternate  companies, each company taking up its duties without fluster, and  covering the other company's retirement with great steadiness until they  reached Bushman's Kop. The marvellous coolness of the force was  particularly amazing, as every man, with the Boers still at his heels,  believed himself to be cut off, yet in spite of this belief showed no  signs of concern. In one regiment, consisting of 11 officers and 200  men, two officers were killed, four wounded, and sixty-six men killed  and wounded.    Strange scenes took place during those awful hours in the donga, and  wonderful escapes were made. One trooper was seized on by a Boer.  \"Surrender,\" cried the Dutchman, but before another word could be  uttered, the trooper's sabre whistled from its sheath and the Boer was  dead. Another who was wounded got off, as he said, \"by the skin of his  teeth.\" He had become jammed under a waggon in company with a Boer--who  had crept there for cover--and the hindquarters of a dying mule. Over  the cart poured a rattling rain of bullets, to which he longed to  respond. The Boer, believing the wounded man to be his prisoner, made  himself known. \"Hot work this,\" he said. The next instant the Boer was  caught by the throat and knocked insensible, while the Briton promptly  extricated himself and vanished from the seething, fighting mass.  Another of the Household Cavalry, when summoned to surrender his rifle,  threw it with such force at the head of his would-be captor that he was  able to make good his escape.    The following interesting account was given from the point of view of an  officer of the Life Guards who was present:--    \"We heard firing at 6.30, and while we were saddling bang came two  shells a little short, followed by three others.
