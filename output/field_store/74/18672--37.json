In this theory I am strengthened by a French author, Edmond Le Masson,  who writes--\"The badger does not always give evidence of his presence in  his woody retreat.... There, should one go to see him, he may, from pure  idleness, remain shut up, it being easy for him to support himself  during the longest period of retirement by licking the secretion which  oozes from the pouch under his tail.\" The author goes on to give an  account which was sent to the French papers by M. Recope, Garde General  at Marly-le-Roi, of a badger that was shut in a culvert without any food  whatever for forty-five days, walled in on every side, and where no tree  root could penetrate. A gamekeeper, a noted trapper, had blocked the  exit, and tried in every way he could devise to trap him, from February  18, 1853, to April 4, and when at last he succumbed to a ruse of the  keeper's he was quite lively, and weighed nearly 19 lbs. It appears that  however carefully his traps were set in the mouth of the exit, the  badger came every night and rolled on them and struck them, as they will  do when they suspect any human infernal machine. That he will remain  for a week or two at a time without issuing from his \"earth\" is certain,  but the most casual observer will see badger tracks in the snow in the  severest weather, and I have never been able to find that there were no  tracks in the snow issuing from the \"earths\" in winter for more than a  week or two at a time. The badger is less active, eats less, goes fewer  and shorter journeys in winter, and has a hibernating tendency; but the  idea that the British species shuts himself up and takes to his bed  through the winter months, and never comes forth till spring, is a  fallacy.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Lower Jaw of Badger.]    [Illustration: FIG. 4. Dovetailed Jaws.]    [Illustration: FIG. 5. Skull of Badger--front view.]    Having attempted a slight description of the badger as far as his  exterior is concerned, I shall leave to \"Dryasdust\" the description and  nomenclature of the badger's interior economy, as well as the  enumeration, weights, and measurements of his bones and muscles. He  possesses, however, one or two structural peculiarities that deserve a  little attention. There is much similarity in the general conformation  of the badger's and bear's skull, but the protecting ridge on the head  is absent in the bear. What gives to the badger's jaw its proverbial and  terrific force? To witness its work is to know that its power of biting,  crushing, and holding must be the result of some peculiarly strong  mechanical as well as muscular construction. The examination of the  skull helps in the solution of the mystery. The conformation of the jaw  is strong, and the muscles attached to it powerful; but besides this he  has two distinguishing structural additions that give his jaws,  furnished with his formidable teeth, the strength and retentive power of  an iron vice. The first is that his lower jaws are locked into sockets  in the skull, and are thereby made--unlike those of all other animals I  know of--impossible of dislocation.[3] His head or skull, when stripped  of flesh and bare, still retains the lower jaws in such a way that they  cannot be displaced without fracturing the massive bones of the head or  jaw. The teeth of a badger require respectful attention. There are  eighteen teeth in the lower and sixteen in the upper jaw, in all  thirty-four. The four big molars, two above and two below, are large and  strong, the upper being much the larger and wider ones, the lower being  longer and fitting within the upper, as do all the lower teeth. The four  canines are large, thick, round, long and formidable, and are his chief  weapons. The lower canines dovetail when the jaws close with the upper,  but all the four points or ends turn outward and backward.        [3] The curved ridges of bone on the skull by which the lower          jaw is held in its place by gripping the condyle are more          or less well developed in most of the weasel family.    [Illustration: FIG. 6. Skull--side view.]    The second peculiarity arises from a high ridge of bone, standing  straight up and running from the base of the skull to between the ears,  giving a firm hold to the ligaments and tendons, and an additional  leverage and length, which are again rendered more effective by passing  over the high cheek-bones as over a pulley before reaching the jaws.  There is a saying that \"a badger never leaves go till he makes his teeth  meet,\" and there is a foundation of truth in it. The length of time he  will hold on to the limb of an enemy is certainly fearful, and the way  in which his thick strong canines go through the bone. On one occasion,  in Wales, a keeper residing near the place I was staying at thought he  saw the badger's tail at the end of a badger-digging, and laid hold of  it to draw him. He had made a terrible mistake, and had got hold of a  hind-foot. The badger held him by the wrist for ten minutes with his arm  stretched up the hole; when he let go his hold the hand was hanging by a  few shreds, and had, of course, to be amputated. I have always drawn a  badger when possible by the tail, as the use of the tongs is sometimes  difficult, especially in certain holes and at great depths, and there is  a liability for the tongs to give way, and then the badger charges in  your face or through your legs. I have seen a badger's teeth break and  fly off in chips from iron tongs, a sight and sound that is not  pleasant. To one who knows how to do it, drawing by the tail is a  simple, quiet, and effective way of \"taking the brock.\"    A badger has the proverbial nine lives that John Chinaman attributes to  women and we to cats. You cannot kill a badger by a blow on the head,  the structure is so dense. His brain is so well protected by the ridges  of bone along his skull and over his eye-sockets, and by the strength  and projection of his cheek-bones, as to make him all but invulnerable  in that quarter. His skin is so thick and tough, and his coat so heavy  and coarse, that shot will scarcely penetrate it; but he has one place  as tender as a nigger's shins, and that is his nose, where, if he is  struck once, he is instantly dispatched. I was witness of a scene in  the hunting field with the Cleveland hounds during the mastership of the  late Mr. Henry Turner Newcomen, which, however disgusting, illustrated  the vitality of the badger. We thought we had run a fox to ground in a  drain. The terriers were sent for, one was put in to bolt him, but after  a quarter of an hour's attempt he came out, having given it up, with  severe marks of punishment. One that could be depended on was then  dispatched to ground, and digging operations commenced. As time went on  we thought from the sound that it could not be a fox, and presently  there was a charge down the drain, and a badger came bouncing and  floundering out among the crowd of bystanders, the terrier holding on to  him. The other terriers, barking furiously to join in the fray, excited  the hounds in an adjoining field; they broke out past the whips, and  nineteen couple were soon at the badger, who was entirely lost to view  in the struggling and worrying mass. But he was plying his jaws all the  time, as was evidenced by the howls of pain from the wounded hounds as  they withdrew from this unaccustomed entertainment. The whips and others  did their best to flog the hounds off, but this was not accomplished for  at least ten minutes. After much bloodshed, and when the last hound had  been choked off, the badger showed neither scratch nor wound, and looked  as fresh as possible. Mr. Newcomen ordered a whip to despatch him and  end the tragedy. The whip clubbed a weighted hunting-stock, striking him  several smashing blows on the head, and left him apparently dead. A  farmer having asked if he might have him to stuff, put him in a sack and  carried him off. A few days later I met the farmer, Mr. R. Brunton, of  Marton, and he told me that when he got home the badger was as lively as  ever, so he put him on a collar and chain and fastened him to a kennel.  The day following he thought, from the appearance of the badger, that he  was hurt about the head, and with some difficulty examined him, and  found that the lower jaw was injured. He thereupon got a revolver and  fired a shot into his ear, and then he assured me the badger only shook  his head. He was so taken aback that for a moment or two he thought of  giving up the attempt to kill him, but firing a second ball into him  behind the shoulder he put an end at once to the poor brute's  sufferings.    The badger, as I have said, is becoming very scarce in England, and is  decreasing in numbers in France and other countries as well. There are,  however, several English and Welsh counties where in woodlands he still  is to be found in considerable numbers, and some districts where they  are common enough. The badger is fairly plentiful in many parts of  Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Hants, and Gloucestershire, along the  Welsh border, and in Mid and South Wales. It is to be found also in  Sussex, Wilts, occasionally in Surrey and Kent, and here and there  through the Midland and home counties. It is becoming rare in the north  of England, but still lingers in the North Riding of Yorkshire, chiefly  in the districts of the hills and moors between Scarborough and York.  In Lincolnshire it is to be found in places; it is extinct in Durham,  and practically so in Northumberland, where within fifty years it was  common enough.    A Northumberland gamekeeper of my father's has told me he knew it in the  Kyloe Craggs and the Howick Woods, and remembered his father taking him  to see their dog tried at a badger near Belford. In none of these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36844"],[0,"In New England Fields and Woods (#4)"],[1," brief at its longest, drowned in the seductive sweets of a sap bucket.    The squirrels are chattering over the wine of the maple branches they  have broached, in merrier mood than the hare, who limps over the matted  leaves in the raggedness of shifting raiment, fitting himself to a new  inconspicuousness.    We shall not find it unpleasant nor unprofitable to take to the woods  now, for we may be sure that they are pleasanter than the untidy fields.  Where nature has her own way with herself, she makes her garb seemly  even now, after all the tousling and rents she gave it in her angry  winter moods. The scraps of moss, bark, and twigs with which the last  surface of the snow was obtrusively littered lie now unnoticed on the  flat-pressed leaves, an umber carpet dotted here with flecks of moss,  there sprigged with fronds of evergreen fern, purple leaves of  squirrelcups, with their downy buds and first blossoms. Between banks so  clad the brook babbles as joyously as amid all the bloom and leafage of  June, and catches a brighter gleam from the unobstructed sunbeams. So  befittingly are the trees arrayed in graceful tracery of spray and beads  of purpling buds, that their seemly nakedness is as beautiful as attire  of summer's greenness or autumn's gorgeousness could make them.    Never sweeter than now, after the long silence of winter, do the birds'  songs sound, and never in all the round of the year is there a better  time to see them than when the gray haze of the branches is the only  hiding for their gay wedding garments.    If you would try your skill at still-hunting, follow up that muffled  roll that throbs through the woods, and if you discover the ruffed  grouse strutting upon his favorite log, and undiscovered by him can  watch his proud performance, you will have done something better worth  boasting of than bringing him to earth from his hurtling flight.    Out of the distant fields come, sweet and faint, the call of the  meadowlark and the gurgle of the blackbirds that throng the brookside  elms. From high overhead come down the clarion note of the goose, the  sibilant beat of the wild ducks' wings, the bleat of the snipe and the  plover's cry, each making his way to northern breeding grounds. Are you  not glad they are going as safely as their uncaught shadows that sweep  swiftly across the shadowy meshes of the forest floor? Are you not  content to see what you see, hear what you hear, and kill nothing but  time?    Verily, you shall have a clearer conscience than if you were disturbing  the voice of nature with the discordant uproar of your gun, and marring  the fresh odors of spring with the fumes of villainous saltpetre.    In the open marshes the lodges of the muskrats have gone adrift in the  floods; but the unhoused inmates count this a light misfortune, since  they may voyage again with heads above water, and go mate-seeking and  food-gathering in sunshine and starlight, undimmed by roof of ice. As  you see them cutting the smooth surface with long, swift, arrowy wakes,  coasting the low shore in quest of brown sweethearts and wives,  whimpering their plaintive call, you can hardly imagine the clumsy body  between that grim head and rudder-like tail capable of such graceful  motion.    The painted wood drake swims above the submerged tree roots; a pair of  dusky ducks splash to flight, with a raucous clamor, out of a sedgy cove  at your approach; the thronging blackbirds shower liquid melody and hail  of discord from the purple-budded maples above you. All around, from the  drift of floating and stranded water weeds, arises the dry, crackling  croak of frogs, and from sunny pools the vibrant trill of toads.    From afar come the watery boom of a bittern, the song of a trapper and  the hollow clang of his setting pole dropping athwart the gunwales of  his craft, the distant roar of a gun and the echoes rebounding from  shore to shore.    The grateful odor of the warming earth comes to your nostrils; to your  ears, from every side, the sounds of spring; and yet you listen for  fuller confirmation of its presence in the long-drawn wail of the plover  and the rollicking melody of the bobolink.          VII    THE WOODCHUCK      Chancing to pass a besmirched April snowbank on the border of a hollow,  you see it marked with the footprints of an old acquaintance of whom for  months you have not seen even so much as this.    It is not that he made an autumnal pilgrimage, slowly following the  swift birds and the retreating sun, that you had no knowledge of him,  but because of his home-keeping, closer than a hermit's seclusion. These  few cautious steps, venturing but half way from his door to the tawny  naked grass that is daily edging nearer to his threshold, are the first  he has taken abroad since the last bright lingering leaf fluttered down  in the Indian summer haze, or perhaps since the leaves put on their  first autumnal tints.    He had seen all the best of the year, the blooming of the first flowers,  the springing of the grass and its growth, the gathering of the  harvests and the ripening of fruits, and possibly the gorgeousness of  autumn melting into sombre gray. He had heard all the glad songs of all  the birds and the sad notes of farewell of bobolink and plover to their  summer home; he had seen the swallows depart and had heard the droning  of the bumblebee among the earliest and latest of his own clover  blossoms. All the best the world had to give in the round of her  seasons, luxuriant growth to feed upon, warm sunshine to bask in, he had  enjoyed; of her worst, he would have none.    So he bade farewell to the gathering desolation of the tawny fields and  crept closer to the earth's warm heart to sleep through the long night  of winter, till the morning of spring. The wild scurry of wind-tossed  leaves swept above him unheard, and the pitiless beat of autumnal rain  and the raging of winter storms that heaped the drifts deeper and deeper  over his forsaken door. The bitterness of cold, that made the furred fox  and the muffled owl shiver, never touched him in his warm nest. So he  shirked the hardships of winter without the toil of a journey in  pursuit of summer, while the starved fox prowled in the desolate woods  and barren fields, the owl hunted beneath the cold stars, and the  squirrel delved in the snow for his meagre fare.    By and by the ethereal but potent spirit of spring stole in where the  frost-elves could not enter, and awakening the earth awakened him. Not  by a slow and often impeded invasion of the senses, but as by the sudden  opening of a door, he sees the naked earth again warming herself in the  sun, and hears running water and singing birds. No wonder that with such  surprise the querulous tremolo of his whistle is sharply mingled with  these softer voices.    Day by day as he sees the sun-loved banks blushing greener, he ventures  further forth to visit neighbors or watch his clover, or dig a new home  in a more favored bank, or fortify himself in some rocky stronghold  where boys and dogs may not enter. Now, the family may be seen moving,  with no burden of furniture or provision, but only the mother with her  gray cubs, carried as a cat carries her kittens, one by one to the new  home among the fresher clover.    On the mound of newly digged earth before it, is that erect, motionless,  gray and russet form a half decayed stump uprising where no tree has  grown within your memory? You move a little nearer to inspect the  strange anomaly, and lo! it vanishes, and you know it was your old  acquaintance, the woodchuck, standing guard at his door and overlooking  his green and blossoming domain.    Are you not sorry, to-day at least, to hear the boys and the dog  besieging him in his burrow or in the old stone wall wherein he has  taken sanctuary? Surely, the first beautiful days of his open-air life  should not be made so miserable that he would wish himself asleep again  in the safety and darkness of winter. But you remember that you were  once a boy, and your sympathies are divided between the young savages  and their intended prey, which after all is likelier than not to escape.    He will tangle the meadow-grass and make free with the bean patch if he  chances upon it, yet you are glad to see the woodchuck, rejoicing like  yourself in the advent of spring.          VIII    THE CHIPMUNK      As the woodchuck sleeps away the bitterness of cold, so in his narrower  chamber sleeps the chipmunk. Happy little hermit, lover of the sun, mate  of the song sparrow and the butterflies, what a goodly and hopeful token  of the earth's renewed life is he, verifying the promises of his own  chalices, the squirrelcups, set in the warmest corners of the woodside,  with libations of dew and shower drops, of the bluebird's carol, the  sparrow's song of spring.    Now he comes forth from his long night into the fullness of sunlit day,  to proclaim his awakening to his summer comrades, a gay recluse clad all  in the motley, a jester, maybe, yet no fool.    His voice, for all its monotony, is inspiring of gladness and  contentment, whether he utters his thin, sharp chip or full-mouthed  cluck, or laughs a chittering mockery as he scurries in at his narrow  door.    He winds along his crooked pathway of the fence rails and forages for  half-forgotten nuts in the familiar grounds, brown with strewn leaves or  dun with dead grass. Sometimes he ventures to the top rail and climbs to  a giddy ten-foot height on a tree, whence he looks abroad, wondering, on  the wide expanse of an acre.    Music hath charms for him, and you may entrance him with a softly  whistled tune and entice him to frolic with a herds-grass head gently  moved before him.    When the fairies have made the white curd of mallow blossoms into  cheeses for the children and the chipmunk, it is a pretty sight to see  him gathering his share handily and toothily stripping off the green  covers, filling"]]]
