It was by this entrance that the house-dwellers  were wont to bring in their food supplies, in the shape of sticks of  green willow, birch and poplar. When these sticks were stripped clean  of their bark, which was the beavers' chief nourishment, they were  then dragged out again, and floated down to be used in the repair of  the dam. The other passage, especially adapted to quick exit in case  of danger from the way of the roof, was about as spacious as the  first, but much shorter and steeper. It was crooked, moreover,--for a  reason doubtless adequate to the architects, but obscure to mere human  observers. The exits of both passages were always in open water, no  matter how fierce the frosts of the winter, how thick the armour of  ice over the surface of the pond. In the neighbourhood of the house  were springs bubbling up through the bottom, and keeping the  temperature of the pond fairly uniform throughout the coldest weather,  so that the ice, at worst, never attained a thickness of more than a  foot and a half, even though in the bigger lakes of that region it  might make to a depth of three feet and over.    [Illustration: \"POKED HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER.\"]    While the wounded beaver lay in the chamber licking his honourable  gashes, two other members of the family entered and approached him. In  some simple but adequate speech it was conveyed to them that their  presence was not required, and they retreated precipitately, taking  different exits. One swam to the grassy edge of the islet, poked his  head above water under the covert of some drooping weeds, listened  motionless for some minutes, then wormed himself out among the long  grasses and lay basking, hidden from all the world but the whirling  hawk overhead. The other, of a more industrious mould, swam off toward  the upper end of the pond where, as he knew, there was work to be  done.    Still as was the surface of the pond, below the surface there was life  and movement. Every little while the surface would be softly broken,  and a tiny ripple would set out in widening circles toward the shore,  starting from a small dark nose thrust up for a second. The casual  observer would have said that these were fish rising for flies; but  in fact it was the apprehensive beavers coming up to breathe, afraid  to show themselves on account of the Boy. They were all sure that he  had not really gone, but was in hiding somewhere, waiting to pounce  upon them.    It was the inhabitants of the House in the Water who were moving  about the pond, this retreat being occupied by their wounded and  ill-humoured champion. The inhabitants of the other house, over on  the shore, who had been interested but remote spectators through  all the strange events of the morning, were now in comfortable  seclusion, resting till it should be counted a safe time to go  about their affairs. Some were sleeping, or gnawing on sappy  willow sticks, in the spacious chamber of their house, while others  were in the deeper and more secret retreats of their two burrows  high up in the bank, connecting with the main house by roomy  tunnels partly filled with water. The two families were quite  independent of each other, except for their common interest in  keeping the great dam in repair. In work upon the dam they acted not  exactly in harmony but in amicable rivalry, all being watchful and all  industrious.    In the under-water world of the beaver pond the light from the  cloudless autumn sun was tawny gold, now still as crystal, now  quivering over the bottom in sudden dancing meshes of fine shadow as  some faint puff of air wrinkled the surface. When the dam was first  built the pond had been of proper depth--from three to four feet--only  in the channel of the stream; while all the rest was shallow, the old,  marshy levels of the shore submerged to a depth of perhaps not more  than twelve or fifteen inches. Gradually, however, the industrious  dam-builders had dug away these shallows, using the material--grass,  roots, clay, and stones--for the broadening and solidifying of the  dam. The tough fibred masses of grass-roots, full of clay and almost  indestructible, were just such material as they loved to work with,  the ancient difficulty of making bricks without straw being well known  to them. Over a large portion of the pond the bottom was now clean  sand and mud, offering no obstacle to the transportation of cuttings  to the houses or the dam.    The beavers, moving hither and thither through this glimmering golden  underworld, swam with their powerful hind feet only, which drove them  through the water like wedges. Their little forefeet, with flexible,  almost handlike paws, were carried tucked up snugly under their chins,  while their huge, broad, flat, hairless tails stuck straight out  behind, ready to be used as a powerful screw in case of any sudden  need. Presently two of the swimmers, apparently by chance, came upon  the body of the beaver which the journeying otter had slain. They knew  that it was contrary to the laws of the clan that any dead thing  should be left in the pond to poison the waters in its decay. Without  ceremony or sentiment they proceeded to drag their late comrade toward  shore,--or rather to shove it ahead of them, only dragging when it got  stuck against some stone or root. At the very edge of the pond, where  the water was not more than eight or ten inches deep, they left it, to  be thrust out and far up the bank after nightfall. They knew that some  hungry night prowler would then take care of it for them.    Meanwhile an industriously inclined beaver had made his way to the  very head of the pond. Here he entered a little ditch or canal which  led off through a wild meadow in a perfectly straight line, toward a  wooded slope some fifty yards or so from the pond. This ditch, which  was perhaps two feet and a half deep and about the same in width,  looked as if it had been dug by the hand of man. The materials taken  from it had been thrown up along the brink, but not on one side only,  as the human ditch-digger does it. The beavers had thrown it out on  both sides. The ditch was of some age, however, so the wild grasses  and weeds had completely covered the two parallel ridges and now  leaned low over the water, partly hiding it. Under this screen the  beaver came to the surface, and swam noiselessly with his head well  up.    At the edge of the slope the canal turned sharply to the left, and ran  in a gradual curve, skirting the upland. Here it was a piece of new  work, raw and muddy, and the little ridges of fresh earth and roots  along its brink were conspicuous. The beaver now went very cautiously,  sniffing the air for any hint of peril. After winding along for some  twenty or thirty yards, the new canal shoaled out to nothingness  behind a screen of alder; and here, in a mess of mud and water, the  beaver found one of his comrades hard at work. There was much of the  new canal yet to do, and winter coming on.    The object of this new ditch was to tap a new food supply. The food  trees near enough to the pond to be felled into it or rolled down to  it had long ago been used. Then the straight canal across the meadow  to the foot of the upland had opened up a new area, an area rich in  birch and poplar. But trees can be rolled easily down-hill that cannot  be dragged along an uneven side-hill; so, at last, it had become  necessary to extend the canal parallel with the bottom of the slope.  Working in this direction, every foot of new ditch brought a lot of  new supplies within reach.    [Illustration: \"STICKY LUMPS, WHICH THEY COULD HUG UNDER THEIR CHINS.\"]    The extremity of the canal was dug on a slant, for greater ease in  removing the material. Here the two beavers toiled side by side,  working independently. With their teeth they cut the tough sod as  cleanly as a digger's spade could do it. With their fore paws they  scraped up the soil--which was soft and easily worked--into sticky  lumps, which they could hug under their chins and carry up the slope  to be dumped upon the grass at the side. Every minute one or the other  would stop, lift his brown head over the edge, peer about, and sniff,  and listen, then fall to work again furiously, as if the whole future  and fortune of the pond were hanging upon his toil. After a  half-hour's labour the canal was lengthened very perceptibly--fully  six or eight inches--and as if by common consent the two brown  excavators stopped to refresh themselves by nibbling at some succulent  roots. While they were thus occupied, and apparently absorbed, from  somewhere up the slope among the birch-trees came the faint sound of a  snapping twig. In half a second the beavers had vanished noiselessly  under water, down the canal, leaving but a swirl of muddy foam to mark  their going.          CHAPTER IV    Night Watchers      WHEN the Boy came creeping down the hillside, and found the water in  the canal still muddy and foaming, he realized that he had just missed  a chance to see the beavers actually at work on their ditch-digging.  He was disappointed. But he found ample compensation in the fact that  here was one of the much-discussed and sometimes doubted canals,  actually in process of construction. He knew he could outdo the  beavers in their own game of wariness and watchfulness. He made up his  mind he would lie out that very night, on the hillside close by--and  so patiently, so unstirringly, that the beavers would never suspect  the eager eyes that were upon them.    All around him, on the nearer slopes, were evidences of the purpose  for which the canal was designed, as well as of the diligence with  which the little people of the pond were labouring to get in their  winter stores. From this diligence, so early in the season, the Boy  argued an early and severe winter. He found trees of every size up to  two feet in diameter cleanly felled,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2995"],[0,"Tacitus on Germany (#4)"],[1,"ther. To ancient men,  the more they abound in descendants, in relations and affinities, so  much the more favour and reverence accrues. From being childless, no  advantage nor estimation is derived.    All the enmities of your house, whether of your father or of your  kindred, you must necessarily adopt; as well as all their friendships.  Neither are such enmities unappeasable and permanent: since even for  so great a crime as homicide, compensation is made by a fixed number of  sheep and cattle, and by it the whole family is pacified to content.  A temper this, wholesome to the State; because to a free nation,  animosities and faction are always more menacing and perilous. In social  feasts, and deeds of hospitality, no nation upon earth was ever more  liberal and abounding. To refuse admitting under your roof any man  whatsoever, is held wicked and inhuman. Every man receives every  comer, and treats him with repasts as large as his ability can possibly  furnish. When the whole stock is consumed, he who has treated so  hospitably guides and accompanies his guest to the next house, though  neither of them invited. Nor avails it, that they were not; they are  there received, with the same frankness and humanity. Between a  stranger and an acquaintance, in dispensing the rules and benefits of  hospitality, no difference is made. Upon your departure, if you ask  anything, it is the custom to grant it; and with the same facility, they  ask of you. In gifts they delight, but neither claim merit from what  they give, nor own any obligation for what they receive. Their manner of  entertaining their guests is familiar and kind.    The moment they rise from sleep, which they generally prolong till late  in the day, they bathe, most frequently in warm water; as in a country  where the winter is very long and severe. From bathing, they sit down to  meat; every man apart, upon a particular seat, and at a separate table.  They then proceed to their affairs, all in arms; as in arms, they  no less frequently go to banquet. To continue drinking night and day  without intermission, is a reproach to no man. Frequent then are their  broils, as usual amongst men intoxicated with liquor; and such broils  rarely terminate in angry words, but for the most part in maimings and  slaughter. Moreover in these their feasts, they generally deliberate  about reconciling parties at enmity, about forming affinities, choosing  of Princes, and finally about peace and war. For they judge, that at no  season is the soul more open to thoughts that are artless and upright,  or more fired with such as are great and bold. This people, of  themselves nowise subtile or politic, from the freedom of the place  and occasion acquire still more frankness to disclose the most secret  motions and purposes of their hearts. When therefore the minds of all  have been once laid open and declared, on the day following the several  sentiments are revised and canvassed; and to both conjectures of time,  due regard is had. They consult, when they know not how to dissemble;  they determine, when they cannot mistake.    For their drink, they draw a liquor from barley or other grain; and  ferment the same so as to make it resemble wine. Nay, they who dwell  upon the bank of the Rhine deal in wine. Their food is very simple; wild  fruit, fresh venison, or coagulated milk. They banish hunger without  formality, without curious dressing and curious fare. In extinguishing  thirst, they use not equal temperance. If you will but humour their  excess in drinking, and supply them with as much as they covet, it will  be no less easy to vanquish them by vices than by arms.    Of public diversions they have but one sort, and in all their meetings  the same is still exhibited. Young men, such as make it their pastime,  fling themselves naked and dance amongst sharp swords and the deadly  points of javelins. From habit they acquire their skill, and from their  skill a graceful manner; yet from hence draw no gain or hire: though  this adventurous gaiety has its reward, namely, that of pleasing the  spectators. What is marvellous, playing at dice is one of their most  serious employments; and even sober, they are gamesters: nay, so  desperately do they venture upon the chance of winning or losing, that  when their whole substance is played away, they stake their liberty and  their persons upon one and the last throw. The loser goes calmly into  voluntary bondage. However younger he be, however stronger, he tamely  suffers himself to be bound and sold by the winner. Such is their  perseverance in an evil course: they themselves call it honour.    Slaves of this class, they exchange in commerce, to free themselves too  from the shame of such a victory. Of their other slaves they make not  such use as we do of ours, by distributing amongst them the several  offices and employments of the family. Each of them has a dwelling of  his own, each a household to govern. His lord uses him like a tenant,  and obliges him to pay a quantity of grain, or of cattle, or of cloth.  Thus far only the subserviency of the slave extends. All the other  duties in a family, not the slaves, but the wives and children  discharge. To inflict stripes upon a slave, or to put him in chains, or  to doom him to severe labour, are things rarely seen. To kill them they  sometimes are wont, not through correction or government, but in heat  and rage, as they would an enemy, save that no vengeance or penalty  follows. The freedmen very little surpass the slaves, rarely are of  moment in the house; in the community never, excepting only such nations  where arbitrary dominion prevails. For there they bear higher sway  than the free-born, nay, higher than the nobles. In other countries the  inferior condition of freedmen is a proof of public liberty.    To the practice of usury and of increasing money by interest, they are  strangers; and hence is found a better guard against it, than if it  were forbidden. They shift from land to land; and, still appropriating  a portion suitable to the number of hands for manuring, anon parcel out  the whole amongst particulars according to the condition and quality  of each. As the plains are very spacious, the allotments are easily  assigned. Every year they change, and cultivate a fresh soil; yet  still there is ground to spare. For they strive not to bestow labour  proportionable to the fertility and compass of their lands, by planting  orchards, by enclosing meadows, by watering gardens. From the earth,  corn only is extracted. Hence they quarter not the year into so many  seasons. Winter, Spring, and Summer, they understand; and for each  have proper appellations. Of the name and blessings of Autumn, they are  equally ignorant.    In performing their funerals, they show no state or vainglory. This only  is carefully observed, that with the corpses of their signal men certain  woods be burned. Upon the funeral pile they accumulate neither apparel  nor perfumes. Into the fire, are always thrown the arms of the dead, and  sometimes his horse. With sods of earth only the sepulchre is raised.  The pomp of tedious and elaborate monuments they contemn, as things  grievous to the deceased. Tears and wailings they soon dismiss: their  affliction and woe they long retain. In women, it is reckoned becoming  to bewail their loss; in men, to remember it. This is what in general  we have learned, in the original and customs of the whole people of  Germany. I shall now deduce the institutions and usages of the several  people, as far as they vary one from another; as also an account of what  nations from thence removed, to settle themselves in Gaul.    That the Gauls were in times past more puissant and formidable, is  related by the Prince of authors, the deified Julius [Caesar]; and hence  it is probable that they too have passed into Germany. For what a small  obstacle must be a river, to restrain any nation, as each grew  more potent, from seizing or changing habitations; when as yet all  habitations were common, and not parted or appropriated by the founding  and terror of Monarchies? The region therefore between the Hercynian  Forest and the rivers Moenus and Rhine, was occupied by the Helvetians;  as was that beyond it by the Boians, both nations of Gaul. There still  remains a place called _Boiemum_, which denotes the primitive name and  antiquity of the country, although the inhabitants have been changed.  But whether the Araviscans are derived from the Osians, a nation  of Germans passing into Pannonia, or the Osians from the Araviscans  removing from thence into Germany, is a matter undecided; since they  both still use the language, the same customs and the same laws. For, as  of old they lived alike poor and alike free, equal proved the evils  and advantages on each side the river, and common to both people. The  Treverians and Nervians aspire passionately to the reputation of being  descended from the Germans; since by the glory of this original, they  would escape all imputation of resembling the Gauls in person and  effeminacy. Such as dwell upon the bank of the Rhine, the Vangiones, the  Tribocians, and the Nemetes, are without doubt all Germans. The Ubians  are ashamed of their original; though they have a particular honour to  boast, that of having merited an establishment as a Roman Colony, and  still delight to be called _Agrippinensians_, after the name of their  founder: they indeed formerly came from beyond the Rhine, and, for the  many proofs of their fidelity, were settled upon the very bank of the  river; not to be there confined or guarded themselves, but to guard and  defend that boundary against the rest of the Germans.    Of all these nations, the Batavians are the most signal in bravery. They  inhabit not much territory upon the Rhine, but possess an island in it.  They were formerly part of the Cattans, and by means of feuds at home  removed to these"]]]
