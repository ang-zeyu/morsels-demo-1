And there is a sense in which it is also perfectly  true--although it would be impossible for me to give the statement  to you with proper qualifications and limitations on an occasion like  this--but there is also a sense in which it is true that every animal  body is made up of an aggregation of minute particles of protoplasm,  comparable each of them to the individual separate yeast plant. And  those who are acquainted with the history of the wonderful revolution  which has been worked in our whole conception of these matters in the  last thirty years, will bear me out in saying that the first germ of  them, to a very great extent, was made to grow and fructify by the study  of the yeast plant, which presents us with living matter in almost its  simplest condition.    Then there is yet one last and most important bearing of this yeast  question. There is one direction probably in which the effects of the  careful study of the nature of fermentation will yield results more  practically valuable to mankind than any other. Let me recall to your  minds the fact which I stated at the beginning of this lecture. Suppose  that I had here a solution of pure sugar with a little mineral matter  in it; and suppose it were possible for me to take upon the point of a  needle one single, solitary yeast cell, measuring no more perhaps than  the three-thousandth of an inch in diameter--not bigger than one of  those little coloured specks of matter in my own blood at this moment,  the weight of which it would be difficult to express in the fraction  of a grain--and put it into this solution. From that single one, if the  solution were kept at a fair temperature in a warm summer's day, there  would be generated, in the course of a week, enough torulae to form  a scum at the top and to form lees at the bottom, and to change the  perfectly tasteless and entirely harmless fluid, syrup, into a solution  impregnated with the poisonous gas carbonic acid, impregnated with the  poisonous substance alcohol; and that, in virtue of the changes worked  upon the sugar by the vital activity of these infinitesimally small  plants. Now you see that this is a case of infection. And from the time  that the phenomenon of fermentation were first carefully studied, it  has constantly been suggested to the minds of thoughtful physicians that  there was a something astoundingly similar between this phenomena of  the propagation of fermentation by infection and contagion, and the  phenomena of the propagation of diseases by infection and contagion.  Out of this suggestion has grown that remarkable theory of many diseases  which has been called the \"germ theory of disease,\" the idea, in fact,  that we owe a great many diseases to particles having a certain life of  their own, and which are capable of being transmitted from one living  being to another, exactly as the yeast plant is capable of being  transmitted from one tumbler of saccharine substance to another. And  that is a perfectly tenable hypothesis, one which in the present state  of medicine ought to be absolutely exhausted and shown not to be true,  until we take to others which have less analogy in their favour. And  there are some diseases most assuredly in which it turns out to be  perfectly correct. There are some forms of what are called malignant  carbuncle which have been shown to be actually effected by a sort of  fermentation, if I may use the phrase, by a sort of disturbance and  destruction of the fluids of the animal body, set up by minute organisms  which are the cause of this destruction and of this disturbance; and  only recently the study of the phenomena which accompany vaccination  has thrown an immense light in this direction, tending to show by  experiments of the same general character as that to which I referred as  performed by Helmholz, that there is a most astonishing analogy between  the contagion of that healing disease and the contagion of destructive  diseases. For it has been made out quite clearly, by investigations  carried on in France and in this country, that the only part of the  vaccine matter which is contagious, which is capable of carrying on its  influence in the organism of the child who is vaccinated, is the solid  particles and not the fluid. By experiments of the most ingenious kind,  the solid parts have been separated from the fluid parts, and it has  then been discovered that you may vaccinate a child as much as you like  with the fluid parts, but no effect takes place, though an excessively  small portion of the solid particles, the most minute that can be  separated, is amply sufficient to give rise to all the phenomena of  the cow pock, by a process which we can compare to nothing but the  transmission of fermentation from one vessel into another, by the  transport to the one of the torula particles which exist in the other.  And it has been shown to be true of some of the most destructive  diseases which infect animals, such diseases as the sheep pox, such  diseases as that most terrible and destructive disorder of horses,  glanders, that in these, also, the active power is the living solid  particle, and that the inert part is the fluid. However, do not suppose  that I am pushing the analogy too far. I do not mean to say that the  active, solid parts in these diseased matters are of the same nature as  living yeast plants; but, so far as it goes, there is a most surprising  analogy between the two; and the value of the analogy is this, that by  following it out we may some time or other come to understand how these  diseases are propagated, just as we understand, now, about fermentation;  and that, in this way, some of the greatest scourges which afflict the  human race may be, if not prevented, at least largely alleviated.    This is the conclusion of the statements which I wished to put before  you. You see we have not been able to have any accessories. If you will  come in such numbers to hear a lecture of this kind, all I can say is,  that diagrams cannot be made big enough for you, and that it is not  possible to show any experiments illustrative of a lecture on such a  subject as I have to deal with. Of course my friends the chemists and  physicists are very much better off, because they can not only show you  experiments, but you can smell them and hear them! But in my case such  aids are not attainable, and therefore I have taken a simple subject and  have dealt with it in such a way that I hope you all understand it,  at least so far as I have been able to put it before you in words; and  having once apprehended such of the ideas and simple facts of the case  as it was possible to put before you, you can see for yourselves the  great and wonderful issues of such an apparently homely subject."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2939"],[0,"William Harvey and the Discovery of the Circulation of the Blood (#4)"],[1,"with all sorts of  people--but, for scientific purposes, it is absolutely invaluable.  Harvey possessed this peculiarity in the highest degree, and so it was  impossible for him to accept what all the authorities told him, and he  looked into the matter for himself. But he was not hasty. He worked at  his new views, and he lectured about them at the College of Physicians  for nine years; he did not print them until he was a man of fifty  years of age; and when he did print them he accompanied them with a  demonstration which has never been shaken, and which will stand till the  end of time. What Harvey proved, in short, was this (see Fig. 4)--that  everybody had made a mistake, for want of sufficiently accurate  experimentation as to the actual existence of the fact which everybody  assumed. To anybody who looks at the blood-vessels with an unprejudiced  eye it seems so natural that the blood should all come out of the liver,  and be distributed by the veins to the different parts of the body, that  nothing can seem simpler or more plain; and consequently no one could  make up his mind to dispute this apparently obvious assumption. But  Harvey did dispute it; and when he came to investigate the matter he  discovered that it was a profound mistake, and that, all this time, the  blood had been moving in just the opposite direction, namely, from the  small ramifications of the veins towards the right side of the heart.  Harvey further found that, in the arteries, the blood, as had previously  been known, was travelling from the greater trunks towards the  ramifications. Moreover, referring to the ideas of Columbus and of Galen  (for he was a great student of literature, and did justice to all his  predecessors), Harvey accepts and strengthens their view of the course  of the blood through the lungs, and he shows how it fitted into his  general scheme. If you will follow the course of the arrows in Fig. 4  you will see at once that--in accordance with the views of Columbus--the  blood passes from the right side of the heart, through the lungs, to the  left side. Then, adds Harvey, with abundant proof, it passes through the  arteries to all parts of the body; and then, at the extremities of their  branches in the different parts of the body, it passes (in what way he  could not tell, for his means of investigation did not allow him to say)  into the roots of the veins--then from the roots of the veins it goes  into the trunk veins--then to the right side of the heart--and then  to the lungs, and so on.    That, you will observe, makes a complete circuit; and it was precisely  here that the originality of Harvey lay. There never yet has been  produced, and I do not believe there can be produced, a tittle of  evidence to show that, before his time, any one had the slightest  suspicion that a single drop of blood, starting in the left ventricle of  the heart, passes through the whole arterial system, comes back through  the venous system, goes through the lungs, and comes back to the place  whence it started. But that is the circulation of the blood, and it was  exactly this which Harvey was the first man to suspect, to discover, and  to demonstrate.    But this was by no means the only thing Harvey did. He was the first  who discovered and who demonstrated the true mechanism of the heart's  action. No one, before his time, conceived that the movement of the  blood was entirely due to the mechanical action of the heart as a pump.  There were all sorts of speculations about the matter, but nobody had  formed this conception, and nobody understood that the so-called  systole of the heart is a state of active contraction, and the so-called  diastole is a mere passive dilatation. Even within our own age that  matter had been discussed. Harvey is as clear as possible about it. He  says the movement of the blood is entirely due to the contractions of  the walls of the heart--that it is the propelling apparatus--and all  recent investigation tends to show that he was perfectly right. And from  this followed the true theory of the pulse. Galen said, as I pointed  out just now, that the arteries dilate as bellows, which have an active  power of dilatation and contraction, and not as bags which are blown  out and collapse. Harvey said it was exactly the contrary--the arteries  dilate as bags simply because the stroke of the heart propels the blood  into them; and, when they relax again, they relax as bags which are no  longer stretched, simply because the force of the blow of the heart  is spent. Harvey has been demonstrated to be absolutely right in this  statement of his; and yet, so slow is the progress of truth, that,  within my time, the question of the active dilatation of the arteries  has been discussed.    Thus Harvey's contributions to physiology may be summed up as follows:  In the first place, he was the first person who ever imagined, and still  more who demonstrated, the true course of the circulation of the blood  in the body; in the second place, he was the first person who ever  understood the mechanism of the heart, and comprehended that its  contraction was the cause of the motion of the blood; and thirdly, he  was the first person who took a just view of the nature of the pulse.  These are the three great contributions which he made to the science of  physiology; and I shall not err in saying--I speak in the presence of  distinguished physiologists, but I am perfectly certain that they will  endorse what I say--that upon that foundation the whole of our knowledge  of the human body, with the exception of the motor apparatus and the  sense organs, has been gradually built up, and that upon that foundation  the whole rests. And not only does scientific physiology rest upon  it, but everything like scientific medicine also rests upon it. As  you know--I hope it is now a matter of popular knowledge--it is the  foundation of all rational speculation about morbid processes; it is  the only key to the rational interpretation of that commonest of  all indications of disease, the state of the pulse; so that, both  theoretically and practically, this discovery, this demonstration of  Harvey's, has had an effect which is absolutely incalculable, and the  consequences of which will accumulate from age to age until they result  in a complete body of physiological science.    Fig.5.--The junction of the arteries and veins by capillary tubes,  discovered by Malpighi (A.D. 1664).    I regret that I am unable to pursue this subject much further; but there  is one point I should mention. In Harvey's time, the microscope was  hardly invented. It is quite true that in some of his embryological  researches he speaks of having made use of a hand glass; but that  was the most that he seems to have known anything about, or that was  accessible to him at that day. And so it came about, that, although he  examined the course of the blood in many of the lower animals--watched  the pulsation of the heart in shrimps, and animals of that kind--he  never could put the final coping-stone on his edifice. He did not know  to the day of his death, although quite clear about the fact that  the arteries and the veins do communicate, how it is that they  communicate--how it was that the blood of the arteries passed into the  veins. One is grieved to think that the grand old man should have gone  down to his tomb without the vast satisfaction it would have given to  him to see what the Italian naturalist Malpighi showed only seven years  later, in 1664, when he demonstrated, in a living frog, the actual  passage of the blood from the ultimate ramifications of the arteries  into the veins. But that absolute ocular demonstration of the truth of  the views he had maintained throughout his life it was not granted to  Harvey to see. What he did experience was this: that on the publication  of his doctrines, they were met with the greatest possible opposition;  and I have no doubt savage things were uttered in those old  controversies, and that a great many people said that these new-fangled  doctrines, reducing living processes to mere mechanism, would sap the  foundations of religion and morality. I do not know for certain that  they did, but they said things very like it. The first point was to  show that Harvey's views were absolutely untrue; and not being able to  succeed in that, opponents said they were not new; and not being able to  succeed in that, that they didn't matter. That is the usual course with  all new discoveries. But Harvey troubled himself very little about these  things. He remained perfectly quiet; for although reputed a hot-tempered  man, he never would have anything to do with controversy if he could  help it; and he only replied to one of his antagonists after twenty  years' interval, and then in the most charming spirit of candour and  moderation. But he had the great satisfaction of living to see his  doctrine accepted upon all sides. At the time of his death, there  was not an anatomical school in Europe in which the doctrine of the  circulation of the blood was not taught in the way in which Harvey had  laid it down. In that respect he had a happiness which is granted to  very few men.    I have said that the other great investigation of Harvey is not one  which can be dealt with to a general audience. It is very complex, and  therefore I must ask you to take my word for it that, although not so  fortunate an investigation, not so entirely accordant with later results  as the doctrine of the circulation; yet that still, this little treatise  of Harvey's has in many directions exerted an influence hardly less  remarkable than that exerted by the Essay upon the Circulation of the  Blood.    And now let me ask your attention to two or three closing remarks.    If you look back upon that period of about 100 years which commences  with Harvey's birth--I mean from the year 1578 to 1680 or thereabouts--I  think you"]]]
