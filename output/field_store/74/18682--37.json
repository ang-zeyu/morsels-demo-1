Who will deny, that it should be given, for all that  it may be worth, to gentle ladies much rather than to men? Within their soft  bosoms, betwixt fear and shame, they harbour secret fires of love, and how  much of strength concealment adds to those fires, they know who have proved  it. Moreover, restrained by the will, the caprice, the commandment of  fathers, mothers, brothers, and husbands, confined most part of their time  within the narrow compass of their chambers, they live, so to say, a life of  vacant ease, and, yearning and renouncing in the same moment, meditate  divers matters which cannot all be cheerful. If thereby a melancholy bred of  amorous desire make entrance into their minds, it is like to tarry there to  their sore distress, unless it be dispelled by a change of ideas. Besides  which they have much less power to support such a weight than men. For, when  men are enamoured, their case is very different, as we may readily perceive.  They, if they are afflicted by a melancholy and heaviness of mood, have many  ways of relief and diversion; they may go where they will, may hear and see  many things, may hawk, hunt, fish, ride, play or traffic. By which means all  are able to compose their minds, either in whole or in part, and repair the  ravage wrought by the dumpish mood, at least for some space of time; and  shortly after, by one way or another, either solace ensues, or the dumps  become less grievous. Wherefore, in some measure to compensate the injustice  of Fortune, which to those whose strength is least, as we see it to be in  the delicate frames of ladies, has been most niggard of support, I, for the  succour and diversion of such of them as love (for others may find  sufficient solace in the needle and the spindle and the reel), do intend to  recount one hundred Novels or Fables or Parables or Stories, as we may  please to call them, which were recounted in ten days by an honourable  company of seven ladies and three young men in the time of the late mortal  pestilence, as also some canzonets sung by the said ladies for their  delectation. In which pleasant novels will be found some passages of love  rudely crossed, with other courses of events of which the issues are  felicitous, in times as well modern as ancient: from which stories the said  ladies, who shall read them, may derive both pleasure from the entertaining  matters set forth therein, and also good counsel, in that they may learn  what to shun, and likewise what to pursue. Which cannot, I believe, come to  pass unless the dumps be banished by diversion of mind. And if it so happen  (as God grant it may) let them give thanks to Love, who, liberating me from  his fetters, has given me the power to devote myself to their gratification.    (1) For Fiammetta, i. e. Maria, natural daughter of Robert, King of Naples.      --  Beginneth here the first day of the Decameron, in which, when the author has  set forth, how it came to pass that the persons, who appear hereafter met  together for interchange of discourse, they, under the rule of Pampinea,  discourse of such matters as most commend themselves to each in turn.  --    As often, most gracious ladies, as I bethink me, how compassionate you are  by nature one and all, I do not disguise from myself that the present work  must seem to you to have but a heavy and distressful prelude, in that it  bears upon its very front what must needs revive the sorrowful memory of the  late mortal pestilence, the course whereof was grievous not merely to eye-  witnesses but to all who in any other wise had cognisance of it. But I would  have you know, that you need not therefore be fearful to read further, as if  your reading were ever to be accompanied by sighs and tears. This horrid  beginning will be to you even such as to wayfarers is a steep and rugged  mountain, beyond which stretches a plain most fair and delectable, which the  toil of the ascent and descent does but serve to render more agreeable to  them; for, as the last degree of joy brings with it sorrow, so misery has  ever its sequel of happiness. To this brief exordium of woe--brief, I say,  inasmuch as it can be put within the compass of a few letters--succeed  forthwith the sweets and delights which I have promised you, and which,  perhaps, had I not done so, were not to have been expected from it. In  truth, had it been honestly possible to guide you whither I would bring you  by a road less rough than this will be, I would gladly have so done. But,  because without this review of the past, it would not be in my power to shew  how the matters, of which you will hereafter read, came to pass, I am almost  bound of necessity to enter upon it, if I would write of them at all.    I say, then, that the years of the beatific incarnation of the Son of God  had reached the tale of one thousand three hundred and forty-eight when in  the illustrious city of Florence, the fairest of all the cities of Italy,  there made its appearance that deadly pestilence, which, whether  disseminated by the influence of the celestial bodies, or sent upon us  mortals by God in His just wrath by way of retribution for our iniquities,  had had its origin some years before in the East, whence, after destroying  an innumerable multitude of living beings, it had propagated itself without  respite from place to place, and so, calamitously, had spread into the West.    In Florence, despite all that human wisdom and forethought could devise to  avert it, as the cleansing of the city from many impurities by officials  appointed for the purpose, the refusal of entrance to all sick folk, and the  adoption of many precautions for the preservation of health; despite also  humble supplications addressed to God, and often repeated both in public  procession and otherwise, by the devout; towards the beginning of the spring  of the said year the doleful effects of the pestilence began to be horribly  apparent by symptoms that shewed as if miraculous.    Not such were they as in the East, where an issue of blood from the nose was  a manifest sign of inevitable death; but in men and women alike it first  betrayed itself by the emergence of certain tumours in the groin or the  armpits, some of which grew as large as a common apple, others as an egg,  some more, some less, which the common folk called gavoccioli. From the two  said parts of the body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and  spread itself in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the  malady began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in many  cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large, now minute  and numerous. And as the gavocciolo had been and still was an infallible  token of approaching death, such also were these spots on whomsoever they  shewed themselves. Which maladies seemed to set entirely at naught both the  art of the physician and the virtues of physic; indeed, whether it was that  the disorder was of a nature to defy such treatment, or that the physicians  were at fault--besides the qualified there was now a multitude both of men  and of women who practised without having received the slightest tincture of  medical science--and, being in ignorance of its source, failed to apply the  proper remedies; in either case, not merely were those that recovered few,  but almost all within three days from the appearance of the said symptoms,  sooner or later, died, and in most cases without any fever or other  attendant malady.    Moreover, the virulence of the pest was the greater by reason that  intercourse was apt to convey it from the sick to the whole, just as fire  devours things dry or greasy when they are brought close to it. Nay, the  evil went yet further, for not merely by speech or association with the sick  was the malady communicated to the healthy with consequent peril of common  death; but any that touched the cloth of the sick or aught else that had  been touched or used by them, seemed thereby to contract the disease.    So marvellous sounds that which I have now to relate, that, had not many,  and I among them, observed it with their own eyes, I had hardly dared to  credit it, much less to set it down in writing, though I had had it from the  lips of a credible witness.    I say, then, that such was the energy of the contagion of the said  pestilence, that it was not merely propagated from man to man but, what is  much more startling, it was frequently observed, that things which had  belonged to one sick or dead of the disease, if touched by some other living  creature, not of the human species, were the occasion, not merely of  sickening, but of an almost instantaneous death. Whereof my own eyes (as I  said a little before) had cognisance, one day among others, by the following  experience. The rags of a poor man who had died of the disease being strewn  about the open street, two hogs came thither, and after, as is their wont,  no little trifling with their snouts, took the rags between their teeth and  tossed them to and fro about their chaps; whereupon, almost immediately,  they gave a few turns, and fell down dead, as if by poison, upon the rags  which in an evil hour they had disturbed.    In which circumstances, not to speak of many others of a similar or even  graver complexion, divers apprehensions and imaginations were engendered in  the minds of such as were left alive, inclining almost all of them to the  same harsh resolution, to wit, to shun and abhor all contact with the sick  and all that belonged to them, thinking thereby to make each his own health  secure. Among whom there were those who thought that to live temperately and  avoid all excess would count for much as a preservative against seizures of  this kind. Wherefore they banded together, and, dissociating themselves from  all others, formed communities in houses where there were no sick, and lived  a separate and secluded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#4)"],[1,"was nearly all white, excepting a beautiful  tortoiseshell patch on the upper part of one thigh.  She was  unexceptionably cleanly, and the frantic efforts she used to make to  wash off that spot of black-and-amber were ridiculous to behold.  She  would sit for hours admiring herself in the glass, and occasionally  dipping her paw in her saucer of milk, until she spied that unhappy  spot; to that she would at once devote a good half-hour, but finding no  appreciable difference in it, she would start away in high dudgeon,  swishing her tail about, like a lion in love.  That spot was the only  barrier to pussy's bliss.  _Moral_: There's no such thing as perfect  happiness here below--even to a cat.    CHAPTER FOUR.    THE BLACK CAT.    Next on the list of classification comes the _Black Cat_, subdivided  into--1, the Pure Black; and 2, the Black-and-white.    1.  _The Pure Black_.--This is one of my pet breeds.  The pure black cat  is such a noble, gentlemanly fellow, and if well-bred and trained--and  he is capable of a very large amount of training--he is one of the best  and most useful cats you can have in the house.  There is no  namby-pambiness about black Tom, and no squeamishness either.  You can  take him or tire of him, just as you please; it is all one to Tom.  There is a certain independence about his every movement, and an  assumption of dignity, as he saunters about the house, gazes at the fire  of a winter's evening, or rolls himself in the sunniest spot of the  garden in summer, that are both amusing and delightful.  Black Tom will  give you a paw, but you may take it or leave it, just as suits you; and  if you annoy him too much, he will very quickly cast his gloves and make  you laugh with the wrong side of your mouth, as the saying is.  And it  is quite astonishing, too, what a beautiful deep and cleanly-cut wound--  I speak feelingly, as a surgeon--Tom can make on the fleshy portion of  your hand, or down the side of your nose.  For black Tom, and all the  race of black cats, seem to have made up their minds ages ago not to  stand any nonsense from man or beast.    But you mustn't run away with the idea that black Tom is a pugnacious  animal, or fond of fighting for fighting's sake.  No, Tom is never  aggressive; he stands a good deal before he is thoroughly roused, and,  to tell the truth, I have more than once seen a tortoiseshell thrash a  black cat double its size.  But if there is a lady cat in the play, the  affections of a queen to be gained, or if black Tom has made up his mind  to carry war into the heart of a rival's camp, doesn't he go at it with  a will!  If the other cat will not surrender, ten to one all you'll find  of that cat in the morning will be the front teeth, the wind of the  battle having blown all the fluff away, while, if you cast your eyes  upwards, you will see black Tom on the top of the wall making love to  his Dinah, and looking as if butter wouldn't melt in his mouth.    Black Tom is generally most exemplary in the matter of cleanliness,  personal or otherwise--there you have him again.  And he is as proud as  Lucifer--for he is quite well aware that he _is_ good-looking.  If he  were a man, he is just the sort of fellow who would wear a well-fitting  coat, spotless linen, and well-fitting boots and gloves, and part his  hair in the centre without appearing a cad.  You will seldom see  cinder-holes in black Tom; if you do, you may lay your honour on it,  that the animal is either aged and infirm, or suffering from some  internal disorder.    The black cat might be called the Newfoundland of the feline race, not  only in colour, but in nearly all his ways.  He is not the pussy,  however, I like to see made a pet of by children, for two reasons--  first, he is too fine an animal to be crumpled and spoiled; and,  secondly, because, like a good many Newfoundlands, he is liable at times  to be just a little uncertain in temper.    Although he cannot save life, like his prototype, still black Tom makes  the best of black guards, and will protect his master or mistress, or  their property.  One or two that I happen to think of now, keep a watch  on their master's wares just as a dog would.  One belonging to Mr  Taylor, of Cumministon, \"clooked\" a little boy in the very act of  stealing a piece of butter, and held him, growling fiercely the while,  until his master came.  The same cat would keep the packet of groceries  ordered by a customer, until the money was paid, and he was told it was  all right.  The cunning and wiliness of the black cat is sometimes  highly amusing.  I have known a cat of this breed feign death to escape  a thrashing; that is, when being thrashed, he pretended that one of the  blows had suddenly killed him, and would lie to all appearance stark and  stiff on the floor for several minutes; but if you watched him narrowly  you would presently see just a line of his cute brown eye, and as soon  as the coast was clear, Tom would come to life again, and be off like a  shot.    Black cats are sometimes thieves.  I know the reader would put it in  more forcible language, but don't you expect for a single moment that I  will say more against my pets than the exigencies of truth compel me to,  so there!  I say they are at times just a _leetle_ addicted to  appropriating what they have but small legal right to.  But there is  this to be said in their favour--when they are thieves _they are swells  at it_.  I have a black cat in my eye at this very moment, and if, my  _dear_ lady, you are at all fond of that sort of thing, it would, simply  do your heart good to watch that pussy stalking steak.  He is such an  honest-looking cat, you see, and from the easy way he sits in the  doorway opposite the butcher's, with his half-shut eyes and his dreamy  air, you would feel convinced that the house was his home, that all the  adjoining property belonged to him, and he had a vote in Parliament and  a seat on the municipal bench.  But bide a wee till Blocks turns round  to serve a customer, when pop! fuss!! honest Tom is round the corner  with a pound of beef in his mouth, before you could say \"Muslin!\"  Oh!  it's charming, I assure you, but rather rough on Blocks.    I must confess, too, that, at times, there is about a black Tom cat a  look which you can only designate as Satanical--Mephistophelean, then,  if you object to the other word--and I have no doubt it is this look of  devil-beauty in Tom which has often led him to be suspected of being  either an imp of darkness or possessed of one.  A witch, you know, is  generally supposed to have as a companion a familiar spirit in the shape  of a black cat.  Superstitions connected with the black cat are still  common in some parts of the country and among sailors.  We had a black  Tom in the _Penguin_ which led us many a pretty dance.  He was treated  as a fiend, poor fellow, and behaved as such; and the captain was as  much afraid of him as anybody else, and never failed to let go the  life-buoy and lower a boat when Tom missed his footing and fell  overboard, which the cat had a happy knack of doing periodically.  Tom  was missed, though, one morning, and seen again no more.  He had  doubtless fallen into the sea in the darkness of the middle watch.    This cat had a strange method of fishing, which is worthy of notice.  You are, I suppose, aware that flying fish are caught by exposing a  light on deck, which they always vault towards.  Black Tom's eyes had  the same effect.  He would sit on the bulwarks and glare into the sea  till a fish flew towards or over him, then he nabbed it nimbly.  Just  before we came to the Cape, for the last time in that commission, I  heard two blue-jackets conversing about this black Tom.    \"Look, see!\" one was saying, \"I think he were a devil, nothin' more and  nothin' less; and I'll bet you five bob he were a devil.\"    \"Done,\" said the other sailor.    Three days after, both men were \"planked\" for coming off drunk.  They  had been on shore drinking their bet beforehand.  Simple souls, they  both came to me after punishment, to get my decision as to who should  pay.  Their doctor, they thought, knew everything.  But very sadly were  they put out, when I told them the bet could never be satisfactorily  decided _in this world_.    \"Ah! doctor,\" said one, waggishly, \"it's a jolly good thing we drank the  bet beforehand.\"    Black Tom's queen is usually a very lively lady, and up to any amount of  fun and mischief.    _Merits_.--For house-hunting they are the _best_ cats you can have.  They are very beautiful and graceful; and, indeed, a well-bred,  well-trained black Tom is a veritable prince of the feline race.  The  finest cat of this sort I ever saw was at Glasgow Show, \"Le Diable\" to  name.  He _was_ a beauty.  What attitudes he did!  What grace in every  movement! and such a colour and coat and eye!  I forget now who owned  him, but I remember I gave him first prize after only one glance at the  others.  Black cats are not so easily seen at night, and their hearing  is extremely keen; so, likewise, is their eyesight.  As a rule, they  kill rats and mice more for sport than anything else, and are fonder of  tackling larger game.  In the field, however, their colour is against  them, and makes them a good mark for the keeper's gun.  I prefer seeing  black Tom in the parlour, or on a hosier's counter, or coiled up in a  draper's window.    _Points_.--1.  _Size_: You want them large--as large an possible, and  with great grace of motion. 2.  _Head_: The head is medium-sized, and  not too bullety; a sharp nose, however, is an abomination in a black  cat.  The ears must be rather longish, and shapely, and well-feathered  internally, and set _straight_ on. 3.  _Eyes_: A brown eye is best, next  best is hazel, which in turn is better than green, but green is better  than yellow. 4.  _Colour_: All black; not even a toe must be white, nor  _one hair of the whiskers_. 5.  _Pelage_:"]]]
