He soon reached the deep hole where the underground  channel of the Coorigel joined the Narran. There he saw what he had  never seen before, namely, this deep hole dry. And he said: \"They have  emptied the holes as they went along, taking the water with them. But  well know I the deep holes of the river. I will not follow the bend,  thus trebling the distance I have to go, but I will cut across from big  hole to big hole, and by so doing I may yet get ahead of the kurreahs.\"  On swiftly sped Byamee, making short cuts from big hole to big hole,  and his track is still marked by the morilla ridges that stretch down  the Narran, pointing in towards the deep holes. Every hole as he came  to it he found dry, until at last he reached the end of the Narran; the  hole there was still quite wet and muddy, then he knew he was near his  enemies, and soon he saw them. He managed to get, unseen, a little way  ahead of the kurreahs. He hid himself behind a big dheal tree. As the  kurreahs came near they separated, one turning to go in another  direction. Quickly Byamee hurled one spear after another, wounding both  kurreahs, who writhed with pain and lashed their tails furiously,  making great hollows in the ground, which the water they had brought  with them quickly filled. Thinking they might again escape him, Byamee  drove them from the water with his spears, and then, at close quarters,  he killed them with his woggarahs. And ever afterwards at flood time,  the Narran flowed into this hollow which the kurreahs in their  writhings had made.    When Byamee saw that the kurreahs were quite dead, he cut them open and  took out the bodies of his wives. They were covered with wet slime, and  seemed quite lifeless; but he carried them and laid them on two nests  of red ants. Then he sat down at some little distance and watched them.  The ants quickly covered the bodies, cleaned them rapidly of the wet  slime, and soon Byamee noticed the muscles of the girls twitching.  \"Ah,\" he said, \"there is life, they feel the sting of the ants.\"    Almost as he spoke came a sound as of a thunder-clap, but the sound  seemed to come from the ears of the girls. And as the echo was dying  away, slowly the girls rose to their feet. For a moment they stood  apart, a dazed expression on their faces. Then they clung together,  shaking as if stricken with a deadly fear. But Byamee came to them and  explained how they had been rescued from the kurreahs by him. He bade  them to beware of ever bathing in the deep holes of the Narran, lest  such holes be the haunt of kurreahs.    Then he bade them look at the water now at Boogira, and he said:    \"Soon will the black swans find their way here, the pelicans and the  ducks; where there was dry land and stones in the past, in the future  there will be water and water-fowl, from henceforth; when the Narran  runs it will run into this hole, and by the spreading of its waters  will a big lake be made.\" And what Byamee said has come to pass, as the  Narran Lake shows, with its large sheet of water, spreading for miles,  the home of thousands of wild fowl.          5.  GOOLOO THE MAGPIE, AND THE WAHROOGAH      Gooloo was a very old woman, and a very wicked old woman too, as this  story will tell. During all the past season, when the grass was thick  with seed, she had gathered much doonburr, which she crushed into meal  as she wanted it for food. She used to crush it on a big flat stone  with small flat stones--the big stone was called a dayoorl. Gooloo  ground a great deal of the doonburr seed to put away for immediate use,  the rest she kept whole, to be ground as required.    Soon after she had finished her first grinding, a neighbouring tribe  came along and camped near where she was. One day the men all went out  hunting, leaving the women and the children in the camp. After the men  had been gone a little while, Gooloo the magpie came to their camp to  talk to the women. She said, \"Why do you not go hunting too? Many are  the nests of the wurranunnahs round here, and thick is the honey in  them. Many and ripe are the bumbles hanging now on the humble trees;  red is the fruit of the grooees, and opening with ripeness the fruit of  the guiebets. Yet you sit in the camp and hunger, until your husbands  return with the dinewan and bowrah they have gone forth to slay. Go,  women, and gather of the plenty that surrounds you. I will take care of  your children, the little Wahroogabs.\"    \"Your words are wise,\" the women said. \"It is foolish to sit here and  hunger, when near at hand yams are thick in the ground, and many fruits  wait but the plucking. We will go and fill quickly our comebees and  goolays, but our children we will take with us.\"    \"Not so,\" said Gooloo, \"foolish indeed were you to do that. You would  tire the little feet of those that run, and tire yourselves with the  burden of those that have to be carried. No, take forth your comebees  and goolays empty, that ye may bring back the more. Many are the spoils  that wait only the hand of the gatherer. Look ye, I have a durrie made  of fresh doonburr seed, cooking just now on that bark between two  fires; that shall your children eat, and swiftly shall I make them  another. They shall eat and be full ere their mothers are out of sight.  See, they come to me now, they hunger for durrie, and well will I feed  them. Haste ye then, that ye may return in time to make ready the fires  for cooking the meat your husbands will bring. Glad will your husbands  be when they see that ye have filled your goolays and comebees with  fruits, and your wirrees with honey. Haste ye, I say, and do well.\"    Having listened to the words of Gooloo, the women decided to do as she  said, and, leaving their children with her, they started forth with  empty comebees, and armed with combos, with which to chop out the bees'  nests and opossums, and with yam sticks to dig up yams.    When the women had gone, Gooloo gathered the children round her and fed  them with durrie, hot from the coals. Honey, too, she gave them, and  bumbles which she had buried to ripen. When they had eaten, she hurried  them off to her real home, built in a hollow tree, a little distance  away from where she had been cooking her durrie. Into her house she  hurriedly thrust them, followed quickly herself, and made all secure.  Here she fed them again, but the children had already satisfied their  hunger, and now they missed their mothers and began to cry. Their  crying reached the ears of the women as they were returning to their  camp. Quickly they came at the sound which is not good in a mother's  ears. As they quickened their steps they thought how soon the spoils  that lay heavy in their comebees would comfort their children. And  happy they, the mothers, would feel when they fed the Wahroogahs with  the dainties they had gathered for them. Soon they reached the camp,  but, alas! where were their children? And where was Gooloo the magpie?    \"They are playing wahgoo,\" they said, \"and have hidden themselves.\"    The mothers hunted all round for them, and called aloud the names of  their children and Gooloo. But no answer could they hear and no trace  could they find. And yet every now and then they heard the sound of  children wailing. But seek as they would they found them not. Then  loudly wailed the mothers themselves for their lost Wahroogahs, and,  wailing, returned to the camp to wait the coming of the black fellows.  Heavy were their hearts, and sad were their faces when their husbands  returned. They hastened to tell the black fellows when they came, how  Gooloo had persuaded them to go hunting, promising if they did so that  she would feed the hungry Wahroogahs, and care for them while they were  away, but--and here they wailed again for their poor Wahroogahs. They  told how they had listened to her words and gone; truth had she told of  the plenty round, their comebees and goolays were full of fruits and  spoils they had gathered, but, alas! they came home with them laden  only to find their children gone and Gooloo gone too. And no trace  could they find of either, though at times they heard a sound as of  children wailing.    Then wroth were the men, saying: \"What mothers are ye to leave your  young to a stranger, and that stranger a Gooloo, ever a treacherous  race? Did we not go forth to gain food for you and our children? Saw ye  ever your husbands return from the chase empty handed? Then why, when  ye knew we were gone hunting, must ye too go forth and leave our  helpless ones to a stranger? Oh, evil, evil indeed is the time that has  come when a mother forgets her child. Stay ye in the camp while we go  forth to hunt for our lost Wahroogahs. Heavy will be our hands on the  women if we return without them.\"    The men hunted the bush round for miles, but found no trace of the lost  Wahroogahs, though they too heard at times a noise as of children's  voices wailing.    But beyond the wailing which echoed in the mothers' ears for ever, no  trace was found of the children. For many days the women sat in the  camp mourning for their lost Wahroogahs, and beating their heads  because they had listened to the voice of Gooloo.          6.  THE WEEOONIBEENS AND THE PIGGIEBILLAH      Two Weeoombeen brothers went out hunting. One brother was much younger  than the other and smaller, so when they sighted an emu, the elder one  said to the younger: \"You stay quietly here and do not make a noise, or  Piggiebillah, whose camp we passed just now, will hear you and steal  the emu if I kill it. He is so strong. I'll go on and try to kill the  emu with this stone.\" The little Weeoombeen watched his big brother  sneak up to the emu, crawling along, almost flat, on the ground. He saw  him get quite close to the emu, then spring up quickly and throw the  stone with such an accurate aim as to kill the bird on the spot. The  little brother was so rejoiced that he forgot his brother's caution,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38356"],[0,"Speciation of the Wandering Shrew (#4)"],[1,"present geographic distribution        of _Sorex vagrans_. The range of _S. v. vagrans_ and its        derivatives _S. v. vancouverensis_, _S. v. halicoetes_, and        _S. v. paludivagus_, is shown by lines slanting in a different        direction than those which mark the range of all the other        subspecies of _S. vagrans_. The region in which _S. v. vagrans_        occurs together with other subspecies of _S. vagrans_ is shown        by the superposition of one pattern upon the other.]    Cases of sympatric existence of two subspecies of one species are  known in birds and in reptiles. Notable examples are in the gull,  _Larus argentatus_ (Mayr, 1940), in the Old World warbler,  _Phylloscopus trochiloides_ (Ticehurst, 1938), and in the great  titmouse, _Parus major_ (Rensch, 1933), of the Old World. In the first  species the two end-members, the herring gull and the lesser  black-backed gull, occur together over an extensive region from  northern Europe and the British Isles throughout Fennoscandia. Fitch  (1940) described a rassenkreis with overlapping subspecies in the  garter snake _Thamnophis ordinoides_.    The geographic distribution of the species _Sorex vagrans_ is shown in  figure 5. The geographic range of the Great Basin subspecies is shown  by a different pattern of lines than the other subspecies of _S.  vagrans_. In the region in which the geographic range of the Great  Basin subspecies overlaps those of the subspecies of the Pacific  Coast, the pattern of shading for the Great Basin subspecies is  superimposed on the patterns for the other subspecies.          ORIGIN OF THE _SOREX VAGRANS_ RASSENKREIS      The distribution of the species _Sorex vagrans_ and that of its  immediate ancestors obviously has not always been the same; during  glacial ages much of the present range of the species in Canada and in  some of the higher mountains of the United States was covered with ice  and not available to the shrew. Furthermore, large areas that are now  too hot and dry to permit the existence of_ S. vagrans_ were at one  time habitable. If we are to speculate on the manner in which the  _Sorex vagrans_ rassenkreis originated we must inquire into the nature  and extent of these climatic changes.    The most recent epoch of geological time, the Pleistocene, is known to  have been divided into a series of alternating glacial and  interglacial ages. During the glacial ages continental and montane  glaciers are judged to have covered much of Canada and the northern  United States. Concurrently the major storm tracks of the west  probably were shifted southward; in any event much of the now arid  intermontane west was much better watered than it is today.    The increased precipitation, and probably glacial meltwater, formed  large lakes in the closed basins of the Great Basin. There were boreal  forests at lower elevations than there are today in comparable  latitudes and continuous boreal habitat probably connected many of the  isolated mountain ranges of the southwest. That probability is  supported by the presence of boreal animals and plants on many of  these isolated ranges today. A boreal tree squirrel, such as  _Tamiasciurus_, could hardly be suspected of crossing a treeless,  intermontane desert valley, miles wide.       [Illustration: FIGS. 6_a_-6_f_.

Fig. 6_f_. _S. v. vagrans_, Baker Creek,        White Pine Co., Nevada, 88042 (after Hall, 1946:113).]    Interglacial ages were characterized by warmth and aridity as compared  to the glacial ages. Glaciers retreated or disappeared, boreal forests  became montane in much of the United States, and the lakes in the  Great Basin were reduced or disappeared. One can envision that during  such times boreal mammals were isolated, their geographic ranges were  restricted, and Sonoran mammals expanded their ranges.    Evidence is more extensive concerning the number and extent of glacial  ages in the eastern than in the western part of North America. This  evidence suggests a division of the Pleistocene into four glacial ages  and four interglacial ages, the fourth interglacial age corresponding  to the present time. More information is available about the  Wisconsinan, or last, glacial age, than about the earlier ones,  because the last glaciation in many montane areas destroyed evidence  of earlier glaciations. The names of currently recognized glacial and  interglacial ages of the Pleistocene are listed below. The names of  interglacial ages are in Italic type.        Wisconsinan      _Sangamonian_      Illinoian      _Yarmouthian_      Kansan      _Aftonian_      Nebraskan    We may think of these ages as an alternating series of cool moist and  warm dry periods during which boreal mammals, and other organisms,  alternately moved southward (disappearing in the glaciated regions)  and northward into previously glaciated areas (while disappearing from  southern areas except on isolated mountain ranges). _Sorex vagrans_  probably followed this pattern of movement and now is restricted to  forested or well-watered places.    One possible series of events culminating in the formation of the  _Sorex vagrans_ rassenkreis may be thought of as having begun during  the Illinoian age. With much of Canada, and perhaps also many areas in  the Rockies, Cascades, and the Sierra Nevada covered with glacial ice,  the shrew-stock ancestral to _Sorex vagrans_ may well have occupied a  more or less continuous range over the Colorado Plateau, the Columbian  Plateau, the Great Basin, and in the forests of the Pacific Coast (as  well as over part of eastern United States, as will be explained  beyond; see fig. 7). At that time the species probably was a  continuously interbreeding unit.       [Illustration: FIG. 7. Possible distribution in Illinoian        (inset) and Sangamonian times of the ancestor of the _Sorex        vagrans-ornatus-longirostris-veraepacis_ complex. Approximate        southern boundary of Illinoian glaciation marked by heavy        line.]    In the ensuing Sangamonian interglacial age all glaciers retreated or  disappeared thereby opening up extensive areas in the north and in the  higher mountains which were occupied by a boreal fauna, including _S.  vagrans_. Concurrently the Great Basin, and probably also much of the  Columbian Plateau, became dry, and desert conditions developed,  perhaps much as they are today. Increasing aridity eliminated shrew  habitat in most places between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra  Nevada-Cascade mountain chain with the result that the geographic  range of the species resembled an inverted \"U\", one arm lying along  the Rocky Mountains and the other along the Cascade-Sierra Nevada  axis; the connection between the two arms was in British Columbia (see  fig. 7). At present _Sorex vagrans_ does occur in isolated places in  the Great Basin, but its existence there is tenuous and seemingly  dependent upon the occurrence of permanent water such as Ruby Lake and  Reese River. With such an arrangement as this it can readily be seen  that gene flow between the eastern and western arms of the \"U\" would  be greatly reduced by distance; consequently differentiation between  the two might be expected.       [Illustration: FIG. 8. Possible distribution of _Sorex vagrans_        at two different times in the Wisconsinan Age. Left, early        Wisconsinan; right, mid-Wisconsinan.]    Wisconsinan glaciation again rendered Canada uninhabitable, and it is  quite possible that extensive areas in the Rocky Mountains, the  Cascades and the Sierra Nevada were heavily glaciated. With the  elimination of the northern part of the \"U\", the eastern and western  arms became isolated, if not by the width of the Columbian Plateau at  least by the glaciated Cascade Mountains. At the same time extensive  areas on the Colorado Plateau and much of the area south to the  Mexican highlands were again occupied by the species. Finally the  Great Basin, again being well-watered, provided suitable habitat for,  and was reoccupied by, _Sorex vagrans_ (see fig. 8). This reoccupation  of the Great Basin took place probably from the Colorado Plateau and  mountains of Arizona and Utah, since the present day shrews of the  species _S. vagrans_ in the Great Basin closely resemble Rocky  Mountain shrews but differ markedly from the large endemic subspecies  of the Pacific Coast.    Finally, with the waning of Wisconsinan ice, the species again was  able to occupy northern and montane areas as it had during Sangamonian  times. Again dessication of the Great Basin caused drastic restriction  of shrew habitat. The small, marsh-dwelling kind of wandering shrew  which had developed there around the lakes of Wisconsinan time  occupied suitable habitat all the way to the Pacific coast where its  range came into contact with that of the western arm of the  Sangamonian \"U.\"-pattern of shrew distribution (see fig. 9). The  animals of this western segment and the new arrivals from the east  were by this time so different from one another that the two kinds  lived in the same areas without interbreeding. The descendants of the  original western arm now are known as _Sorex vagrans sonomae_, _S. v.  pacificus_, _S. v. yaquinae_, and _S. v. bairdi_. The newcomers from  the east are known as _S. v. vagrans_, _S. v. halicoetes_, _S. v.  paludivagus_ and _S. v. vancouverensis_.    In addition to occupying the Pacific Coast from San Francisco Bay  north to the Fraser Delta, the Great Basin subspecies populated the  Columbia"]]]
