I have had pups of this kind which I kept until they were two years  old; have bought pet foxes, and let them catch and kill them, but  never yet made a runner out of a dog that it was not born in.      [Illustration: Fox Hounds.--Graduates From the Training  School.]    Should your pup go in and stay, don't run him too often unless he is  near a year old. Never take him out unless he is well fed, and in  good shape to run. After a race or two let him go as soon as the  trail is struck, and after a few races, catch the old dog, after the  fox is going, and see what the pup will do alone. Then take them out  on a good day, let the old dog pick up the trail, and after the pups  have started, catch the old dog and let the pups go alone, and if  they trail, start and run that fox to a finish, that is all the  pedigree they will ever need.    When you turn your dog loose, don't run and yell and get him so  excited that he doesn't know what to do, just unbuckle his collar and  let him go. If he does not understand going into a race, it will not  help matters to excite him, just walk to where the fox has passed and  he will likely take the trail, and will know better what to do the  next time.    When your dogs are running and happen to lose the trail near you, do  not run and call, trying to help them get started, for if let alone  they are far more apt to pick it up and go on in good shape; by  getting them excited and running wild the chase would likely end  right there.    My rule is this: Whenever I pull a dog's collar, he must look out for  No. 1 without my going to show him.    Should you not have an old dog to help train your pup, you can train  him alone, but it is more trouble.    If you have snow, lead your dog until you find a fox trail, then  follow it, still leading your dog; if there happens to be  considerable scent in the trail, he may want to follow it, if so turn  him loose, but follow him up and help him to start his fox. If there  is no scent in the trail, lead your dog until you start the fox, then  let him go and let him work for himself.    Should you have neither snow nor trained dog, you will have more  trouble, but I have made No. 1 dogs without either.    If you know where foxes stay, go there, turn your dog loose, and he  will start to running rabbits; this will scare the fox up and your  dog will likely cross its track; if he is a born fox dog, he will  leave the rabbit for the fox every time. You may have to make several  trips, but after you get one race, your dog will be looking for a fox  chase, and will soon take a cold fox trail in preference to a rabbit.    After you have trained your dog to running foxes or coon, you will  wish to break him of running rabbits; this is generally an easy  matter, for a genuine dog prefers the fox or coon and some will quit  it of their own accord. If not, try scolding him when he starts a  rabbit. If that fails, whip him, but where foxes are plentiful, you  will seldom have to do this.    My pups are accustomed to the crack of a 22 rifle, as I shoot near  them while young, so never have any gun-shy dogs.    There is just as much in feeding a running dog, as a running horse.  Some say a light feed just before starting and I have heard some say,  don't feed at all. Now for a grey fox, it does not make so much  difference, as the chase will only last an hour or two, and sometimes  not ten minutes, but where it comes to an old red fox,--one that you  start Saturday night and return just in time to accompany your wife  to church next morning, it is quite different.    A dog to do his best should be used to running. He should have a few  days' rest, and if his feet are sore, grease once each day with salty  grease. At least three days before the race, drop all sloppy food and  give rye or corn-bread with scraps from the butcher shop mixed in  before baking. Feed liberally twice each day and if your race  promises to be a hard one, feed extra before starting, some food that  will give the greatest amount of strength, with the least possible  bulk. Then arrange to give your dog a good heavy feed as soon as he  returns home, and he will be ready for the next race sooner than if  compelled to go to rest hungry.    Before closing, I will say something more with regard to  breeding:--We often see where someone has pure bred Walker, Williams,  Redbone or Buckfield Blues. Now to my understanding, these are  strains of dogs, bred by southern fox hunters, 50 or 75 years ago,  and to keep them pure, there must have been a lot of inbreeding, a  thing I do not approve of. Now why would it not have been better for  Mr. Walker to have selected one of his very best bitches and bred her  to one of Mr. Williams' best dogs, then called the pups the \"American  Fox Hounds\"--as grand a dog as ever put his nose to a trail?      [Illustration: Typical Coon Hounds.]        CHAPTER IV.    TRAINING THE COON DOG.    In training, we have been told to drag a 'coon hide, lead a pet  'coon, etc., but your pup soon learns to associate your tracks with  the trail of the drag, and when you carry the 'coon hide he simply  follows your track to where you start the drag again. Should you have  a 'coon so tame that it will follow you, start out and tramp through  the woods, along streams and just such places as 'coons frequent.  Your 'coon will run logs, go up on the side of trees, in and out of  the water, in fact will do just about as a wild 'coon would. After  you have been gone for some time, have someone turn your pup on the  trail and if he runs it, keep him a little later each time, and you  will soon have a trailer out of him anyway. Should you have neither  'coon nor old dog, you can train your pup without.    In nearly all places where there are 'coons, squirrels and woodchucks  (groundhogs) may be found also. Teach your dog to lead and when he is  about eight months old, attach a light cord to his collar; then some  good morning for squirrels, take him to the woods. Keep him until he  gets sight of a squirrel, then drop the cord and let him go; he will  likely see it run up a tree, and perhaps he will bark, but if not, do  not urge him, but give him plenty of time; then take him to find  another and if he does not get to barking, get one in small timber,  where you can make it jump from tree to tree; if he does not bark  then, he will never be much of a 'coon dog.    If he barks after he has learned to tree squirrels, take him to a  woodchuck country. He will soon get to working after woodchucks and  while they won't all tree, some of them will. Should he get one in a  hole, hollow log or tree, get it for him if possible and let him kill  it, and see that he doesn't get hurt much. If he trees one, shoot it  out for him, and after he has gotten a few, and trees another, go to  where you can see him, but do not let him see you, and watch until he  starts to leave; then go to him and by so doing, he will learn to  stay and wait for you.    After you have a good dog for woodchucks, you may rest assured that  he will tree a 'coon if he finds a trail. If it happens to be summer  time, take him where 'coons abide and turn him loose. He will likely  run rabbits, but when he strikes a 'coon trail, he will take it. As  soon as you know he is after a 'coon, keep after him as near as  possible, but let him have his own way. If he trees it and barks, get  to him as soon as you can, but do not urge him, for he will get to  lying as soon as you want him to without any help from you.    After he has barked awhile, encircle the tree with him; then if the  'coon has been up and gone on again, he will strike his trail, and,  after a few times, he will learn to circle before barking. If the  'coon is up and it is summer time or early fall, when 'coon hides are  not prime, take your dog back from the tree, keep still, and unless  it is a den tree, you won't have long to wait, for another 'coon  chase, and by keeping your dog longer each time, you will soon have a  cold trailer out of him.    This may seem considerable work for some, but it takes work and time  to make even a fair 'coon dog. Should you have a good dog to train  with, it saves lots of work, but even then it is a good plan to work  early in the season, and tree your 'coon several times in one night,  as you do not have far to go after the first tree.    In breeding 'coon dogs, the same rule applies as in fox dogs--if your  dog is bred from a line of 'cooners, he will take to it naturally.  Some one will say, I will take a house cat to teach my dog to tree.  Well I have done that myself, but after cutting several good trees,  only to get a house cat, I learned better. It is just as easy to  break a dog from running cats, as rabbits, and more so. I do not  consider a dog that will run and tree every house cat he strikes the  trail of, a No. 1 'coon dog, no matter what his other good qualities  may be.    Years ago, when timber was more plentiful than now, I always trained  my dog to take care of himself, when a tree was cut for 'coons, and I  never had a dog get hurt, nor had many 'coons to get very far from  the tree.    They are easily taught by cutting small trees in the day time and  making them keep back until the tree is down; but now, timber is  getting rather scarce and valuable to cut for 'coons.    When a dog is trained for 'coon so that he is first class, he is  valuable in dollars and cents as well as satisfaction. One of our  good friends sets the value in this way, and we agree with him,  except that where one is training a dog for his own use, love of the  pursuit and woods repays him in a measure for his trouble:    \"A man ought not to expect to get a first class 'coon dog for five or  ten dollars. In fact, one can't be trained for that price, not saying  anything about his feed. In the first place stop and consider how  many nights one has to be taken out to get him to understand running  them,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3426"],[0,"On Books and the Housing of Them (#4)"],[1,"you please, but with only  about nine feet of height taken for the bookcases: inasmuch as all heavy  ladders, all adminicula requiring more than one hand to carry with care,  are forsworn. And there is no gallery. In the manner I have described,  there may be placed on the floor of such a room, without converting it  from a room into a warehouse, bookcases capable of receiving, in round  numbers, 20,000 volumes.    The state of the case, however, considered as a whole, and especially  with reference to libraries exceeding say 20,000 or 30,000 volumes, and  gathering rapid accretions, has been found to require in extreme cases,  such as those of the British Museum and the Bodleian (on its limited  site), a change more revolutionary in its departure from, almost  reversal of, the ancient methods, than what has been here described.    The best description I can give of its essential aim, so far as I have  seen the processes (which were tentative and initial), is this. The  masses represented by filled bookcases are set one in front of another;  and, in order that access may be had as it is required, they are set  upon trams inserted in the floor (which must be a strong one), and  wheeled off and on as occasion requires.    The idea of the society of books is in a case of this kind abandoned.  But even on this there is something to say. Neither all men nor all  books are equally sociable. For my part I find but little sociabilty  in a huge wall of Hansards, or (though a great improvement) in the  Gentleman's Magazine, in the Annual Registers, in the Edinburgh and  Quarterly Reviews, or in the vast range of volumes which represent  pamphlets innumerable. Yet each of these and other like items variously  present to us the admissible, or the valuable, or the indispensable.  Clearly these masses, and such as these, ought to be selected first for  what I will not scruple to call interment. It is a burial; one, however,  to which the process of cremation will never of set purpose be applied.  The word I have used is dreadful, but also dreadful is the thing.  To have our dear old friends stowed away in catacombs, or like the  wine-bottles in bins: the simile is surely lawful until the use of that  commodity shall have been prohibited by the growing movement of the  time. But however we may gild the case by a cheering illustration, or by  the remembrance that the provision is one called for only by our excess  of wealth, it can hardly be contemplated without a shudder at a process  so repulsive applied to the best beloved among inanimate objects.    It may be thought that the gloomy perspective I am now opening exists  for great public libraries alone. But public libraries are multiplying  fast, and private libraries are aspiring to the public dimensions. It  may be hoped that for a long time to come no grave difficulties will  arise in regard to private libraries, meant for the ordinary use of that  great majority of readers who read only for recreation or for general  improvement. But when study, research, authorship, come into view, when  the history of thought and of inquiry in each of its branches, or in any  considerable number of them, has to be presented, the necessities of the  case are terribly widened. Chess is a specialty and a narrow one. But  I recollect a statement in the Quarterly Review, years back, that there  might be formed a library of twelve hundred volumes upon chess. I think  my deceased friend, Mr. Alfred Denison, collected between two and three  thousand upon angling. Of living Englishmen perhaps Lord Acton is the  most effective and retentive reader; and for his own purposes he has  gathered a library of not less, I believe, than 100,000 volumes.    Undoubtedly the idea of book-cemeteries such as I have supposed is very  formidable. It should be kept within the limits of the dire necessity  which has evoked it from the underworld into the haunts of living men.  But it will have to be faced, and faced perhaps oftener than might be  supposed. And the artist needed for the constructions it requires will  not be so much a librarian as a warehouseman.    But if we are to have cemeteries, they ought to receive as many bodies  as possible. The condemned will live ordinarily in pitch darkness, yet  so that when wanted, they may be called into the light. Asking myself  how this can most effectively be done, I have arrived at the conclusion  that nearly two-thirds, or say three-fifths, of the whole cubic contents  of a properly constructed apartment[12] may be made a nearly solid mass  of books: a vast economy which, so far as it is applied, would probably  quadruple or quintuple the efficiency of our repositories as to  contents, and prevent the population of Great Britain from being  extruded some centuries hence into the surrounding waters by the  exorbitant dimensions of their own libraries.            --The End--          FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: In Der alte und der neue Glaube]    [Footnote 2: xxi, 25.]    [Footnote 3: First of all it seems to have referred to the red capital  letters placed at the head of chapters or other divisions of works.]    [Footnote 4: Cic.
