He seldom turns to acknowledge the greeting of a passer-by,  for but few people are in the streets to-day. Now and then a group of  Ruthenian peasants may be seen reeling out of the town-gate, or a  nobleman drives past in his light britzska, or perhaps it is some poor  peddler, who has been wandering the whole week long from farm to farm in  the district, exchanging money and cloth for the sheepskins, laden with  which he is returning to town. His burden is heavy and his gain is but  small, yet his pale, worn, and, it may be, cunning face is not without  a gleam of joy and pride. A few hours later and the miserable ragged  Jewish peddler, on whom farmers and nobles had tried the weight of their  whips, and on whom they had made many a scurrilous jest, is transformed  into a proud prince awaiting the arrival of his lovely bride--the day of  rest, the Sabbath.    [Footnote 1: A kind of biscuit.]    He has not long to wait now, the Friday afternoon is drawing to a close,  and the sun will soon set. Preparations for the day of rest are being  made in every house; the sunlit street is almost totally deserted. Herr  Lozinski, the district judge, a tall, thin, yellow-faced man, is coming  down the street accompanied by a young stranger. He stands at the door  for a few minutes talking to Moses before going up-stairs to his rooms.  They discuss the badness of the times, the low price of silver, and the  promising April weather; for it is a real spring day, more like May than  anything else. The streets are very dry, except for a few puddles in the  market-place; the air is deliciously soft and warm, and yonder in the  monk's garden the fruit-trees and elder bushes are covered with blossom.  The Christian children coming home from school are shouting, \"Spring!  spring is coming!\" \"Yes, spring is coming,\" says the district judge,  taking off his hat and leading his guest up-stairs. \"Spring is coming,\"  repeats old Moses, passing his hand across his forehead as if awakening  from a dream.... \"Spring is coming!\"    \"Old Moses is a very remarkable man,\" says the district judge to the new  registrar. \"I scarcely know whether to call him eccentric or not. You  won't believe it, but he knows as much law as the best barrister in the  land. And besides that, he's the richest man in the country-side. He is  said to be worth millions! And yet he slaves week-in, week-out, as  though he hadn't the wherewithal to buy his Sabbath dinner.\"    \"A niggardly money-grubber like all the Jews,\" says the registrar,  making the smoke of his cigar curl slowly in the air.    \"H'm! By no means. He is generous. I must confess that he is very  generous. But his generosity gives him no more pleasure than his wealth.  Yet he goes on speculating as before. And for whom, if you please--for  whom?\"    \"Has he no children?\" inquires the other.    \"Yes. That's to say, he has and he hasn't. Ask him, and he will tell you  that he has none. But you don't know his story, do you?... Every one  here knows it--but then, you see, you come from Lemberg. I suppose that  you never heard any one speak of the old man's daughter, beautiful Esther  Freudenthal, when you were there? The whole affair is very romantic; I  must tell it you....\"    The old man, whose story every one knows, is still leaning against the  doorway of his house, watching the flower-laden branches of the  fruit-trees in the cloister garden as they sway in the breeze. What is  he thinking of? It can not be of his business; for his eyes are wet with  unshed tears, and his lips tremble for a moment as though with stifled  grief. He shades his eyes with his hand, as if the sunlight were  blinding him. Then he draws himself up, and shakes his head, as though  trying to rid himself of the sad thoughts that oppress him.    \"Make haste, the Sabbath is drawing nigh,\" he says to the painter as he  approaches to examine his work more closely.    The little humpback, who wears a shabby frogged coat of a fashion only  known in Poland, has just finished the folding-doors, and now limps away  to the window-shutters, paint-pot in hand. These shutters had formerly  been colored a bright crimson, and their faded surface still bears the  almost illegible inscription in white letters: \"For ready money  to-day--to-morrow gratis.\" Their glory has long since departed, and the  little man, quickly filling his brush with the vivid green, begins to  paint over them, saying as he works, \"Do you remember, Pani Moschko,  that I painted this too?\" and with that he points to the dirty brown-red  of the first coloring.    But Moses is thinking of other things, and scarcely heeding him, answers  with an indifferent, \"Really.\"    \"Of course I did,\" continues the little man eagerly. \"Don't you  remember? I painted it fifteen years ago on just such another beautiful  day as this is. The house was quite new, and I was a young fellow then.  When I had finished my work, you looked at it, and said, 'I am pleased  with you, Janko.' You were standing in front of the door, just where you  are now, I verily believe, and your little Esterka was beside you. Holy  Virgin! how lovely the child was! And how pleasant it was to hear her  laugh when she saw the white letters appearing one after the other on  the red ground! She asked what they meant, the darling! You gave me  three Theresien _zwanzigers_[2] for my work. I remember it as distinctly  as if it were yesterday. I thought then that it was my last job in  Barnow; for old Herr von Polanski wanted to send me to the school of  design at Cracow. But soon afterward he lost every farthing he  possessed, and was even obliged to sell his daughter Jadwiga in order to  get food to eat, and so I remained a house-painter. Ah yes! man proposes  and.... Deuce take it! The old man's gone, and here I am gossiping away  to the empty air. I suppose that the Jew is counting his money as  usual....\"    [Footnote 2: About 1s. 8d. English.]    But Janko is mistaken. Moses Freudenthal is not counting his treasures  at this moment. Indeed he would probably give up all that he possesses  without a sigh could he thereby rid his life of what has made him  poorer and more wretched than the beggar at his gates. He has taken  refuge in the large dusky sitting-room, into which no ray of sunlight,  and no sound of the human voice, can penetrate. He can now throw himself  into his arm-chair, and sob from the bottom of his heart without any one  asking him what is the matter; he can let his head fall upon his breast,  tear his hair, or cover his face with his hands.... He does not weep, or  pray, nor yet does he curse; he moans out in pain, the words echoing in  the quiet room, \"How pleasant it was to hear the child's laugh!...\" Thus  he sits alone in the twilight. At last he gets up and raises his eyes as  if in prayer--nay, rather as a man who demands a right. \"O God!\" he  cries, \"I do not ask that she may come back to me, for I made my  servants drive her from my door; I do not ask that she may be happy, for  she has sinned grievously in the sight of God and man; I do not ask that  she may be unhappy, for she is my own flesh and blood; I only ask that  she may die, so that I may not have to curse my only child. Let her die,  O God, let her die, or let me!...\"    Meanwhile the district judge is concluding his story in the room above.  \"No one knows what has become of the pretty little girl. She is  forgotten; her father even doesn't seem to remember her existence.  They're a heartless race these Jews; they're all alike....\"    It has grown dusk in the town, but there is no gloom in the hearts of  its Jewish inhabitants. The dismal irregularly built houses of the  Ghetto are now enlivened by thousands of candles, and thousands of happy  faces. The Sabbath has begun in the hearts of these people and in their  rooms, a common and usual occurrence, and yet a mysterious and blessed  influence that drives away all that is poor and mean in everyday life.  To-day, every hovel is lighted up, and every heart made glad with  sufficiency of food. The teacher of the law has forgotten his hunger,  the water-carrier his hard work, the peddler the blows and derision that  continually fall to his lot, and the rich usurer his gain. To-day all  are equal; all are the happy trustful sons of the same Almighty Father.  The feeble light of the tallow-candle in its rude candlestick, and the  soft light of the wax-candle in the silver candelabra, illumine the same  picture. The daughters of the house and the little boys sit silently  watching their mother, as she, in obedience to the beautiful old custom  handed down from generation to generation, blesses the candles. The  father then takes the large prayer-book down from the book-shelf and  gives it to his eldest son to carry to the synagogue for him. After that  they all go out into the street, the men and women keeping apart, as the  strict law commands. Their words are few, and those they utter are grave  and quiet. To-day neither grief nor joy finds vent in speech, for all  hearts are full of the divine peace of the Sabbath....    The large white house opposite the Dominican monastery is also  illuminated. But the candles were lighted by a stranger, for there is no  mistress there to speak the customary blessing. The finest linen covers  the tables in the best parlor, which is handsomely furnished, but no  child's merry laugh, and no loving word is heard there. The melancholy  sound of the sputtering candles alone disturbs the stillness.    But the old man who now enters the room in his Sabbath suit has been  accustomed to this state of things for years--for five long years. At  first he used involuntarily to turn and listen for the sound of the  voice he loved so well; for it was on an evening such as this that his  child had left him. But this evening he crosses the room quickly, and  taking the heavy leather-bound"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#4)"],[1,"terrible fangs, moves to a short distance and does not seem to  trouble unduly about the buffeting which she has received. She quietly  polishes her wings and curls her antennae by pulling them while standing  on them with her fore-tarsi. The attack of the Segestria, stimulated by  my shakes, is repeated ten times over; and the Pompilus always escapes  from the venomous fangs unscathed, as though she were invulnerable.    Is she really invulnerable? By no means, as we shall soon have proved to  us; if she retires safe and sound, it is because the Spider does not use  her fangs. What we see is a sort of truce, a tacit convention forbidding  deadly strokes, or rather the demoralization due to captivity; and the  two adversaries are no longer in a sufficiently warlike mood to make  play with their daggers. The tranquillity of the Pompilus, who keeps on  jauntily curling her antennae in face of the Segestria, reassures me  as to my prisoner's fate; for greater security, however, I throw her a  scrap of paper, in the folds of which she will find a refuge during  the night. She instals herself there, out of the Spider's reach. Next  morning I find her dead. During the night the Segestria, whose habits  are nocturnal, has recovered her daring and stabbed her enemy. I had  my suspicions that the parts played might be reversed! The butcher of  yesterday is the victim of to-day.    I replace the Pompilus by a Hive-bee. The interview is not protracted.  Two hours later, the Bee is dead, bitten by the Spider. A Drone-fly  suffers the same fate. The Segestria, however, does not touch either of  the two corpses, any more than she touched the corpse of the Pompilus.  In these murders the captive seems to have no other object than to rid  herself of a turbulent neighbour. When appetite awakes, perhaps the  victims will be turned to account. They were not; and the fault was  mine. I placed in the jar a Bumble-bee of average size. A day later the  Spider was dead; the rude sharer of her captivity had done the deed.    Let us say no more of these unequal duels in the glass prison and  complete the story of the Pompilus whom we left at the foot of the wall  with the paralysed Segestria. She abandons her prey on the ground and  returns to the wall. She visits the Spider's funnels one by one, walking  on them as freely as on the stones; she inspects the silken tubes,  dipping her antennae into them, sounding and exploring them; she enters  without the least hesitation. Whence does she now derive the temerity  thus to enter the Segestria's haunts? But a little while ago, she  was displaying extreme caution; at this moment, she seems heedless  of danger. The fact is that there is no danger really. The Wasp is  inspecting uninhabited houses. When she dives down a silken tunnel, she  very well knows that there is no one in, for, had the Segestria been  there, she would by this time have appeared on the threshold. The fact  that the householder does not show herself at the first vibration of the  neighbouring threads is a certain proof that the tube is vacant; and the  Pompilus enters in full security. I would recommend future observers not  to take the present investigations for hunting-tactics. I have already  remarked and I repeat: the Pompilus never enters the silken ambush while  the Spider is there.    Among the funnels inspected one appears to suit her better than  the others; she returns to it frequently in the course of her  investigations, which last for nearly an hour. From time to time she  hastens back to the Spider lying on the ground; she examines her, tugs  at her, drags her a little closer to the wall, then leaves her the  better to reconnoitre the tunnel which is the object of her preference.  Lastly she returns to the Segestria and takes her by the tip of the  abdomen. The quarry is so heavy that she has great difficulty in moving  it along the level ground. Two inches divide it from the wall. She gets  to the wall, not without effort; nevertheless, once the wall is reached,  the job is quickly done. We learn that Antaeus, the son of Mother Earth,  in his struggle with Hercules, received new strength as often as his  feet touched the ground; the Pompilus, the daughter of the wall, seems  to increase her powers tenfold once she has set foot on the masonry.    For here is the Wasp hoisting her prey backwards, her enormous prey,  which dangles beneath her. She climbs now a vertical plane, now a slope,  according to the uneven surface of the stones. She crosses gaps where  she has to go belly uppermost, while the quarry swings to and fro in the  air. Nothing stops her; she keeps on climbing, to a height of six feet  or more, without selecting her path, without seeing her goal, since she  goes backwards. A lodge appears no doubt reconnoitred beforehand and  reached, despite the difficulties of an ascent which did not allow her  to see it. The Pompilus lays her prey on it. The silken tube which she  inspected so lovingly is only some eight inches distant. She goes to it,  examines it rapidly and returns to the Spider, whom she at length lowers  down the tube.    Shortly afterwards I see her come out again. She searches here and  there on the wall for a few scraps of mortar, two or three fairly large  pieces, which she carries to the tube, to close it up. The task is done.  She flies away.    Next day I inspect this strange burrow. The Spider is at the bottom of  the silken tube, isolated on every side, as though in a hammock. The  Wasp's egg is glued not to the ventral surface of the victim but to the  back, about the middle, near the beginning of the abdomen. It is white,  cylindrical and about a twelfth of an inch long. The few bits of mortar  which I saw carried have but very roughly blocked the silken chamber at  the end. Thus Pompilus apicalis lays her quarry and her eggs not in a  burrow of her own making, but in the Spider's actual house. Perhaps the  silken tube belongs to this very victim, which in that event provides  both board and lodging. What a shelter for the larva of this Pompilus:  the warm retreat and downy hammock of the Segestria!    Here then, already, we have two Spider-huntresses, the Ringed Pompilus  and P. apicalis, who, unversed in the miner's craft, establish their  offspring inexpensively in accidental chinks in the walls, or even in  the lair of the Spider on whom the larva feeds. In these cells, acquired  without exertion, they build only an attempt at a wall with a few  fragments of mortar. But we must beware of generalizing about this  expeditious method of establishment. Other Pompili are true diggers,  valiantly sinking a burrow in the soil, to a depth of a couple of  inches. These include the Eight-spotted Pompilus (P. octopunctatus,  PANZ.), with her black-and-yellow livery and her amber wings, a little  darker at the tips. For her game she chooses the Epeirae (E. fasciata,  E. sericea) (For the Garden-spiders known as the Banded Epeira and  the Silky Epeira cf. \"The Life of the Spider\": chapters 11, 13, 14 et  passim.--Translator's Note.), those fat Spiders, magnificently adorned,  who lie in wait at the centre of their large, vertical webs. I am not  sufficiently acquainted with her habits to describe them; above all, I  know nothing of her hunting-tactics. But her dwelling is familiar to  me: it is a burrow, which I have seen her begin, complete and close  according to the customary method of the Digger-wasps.        CHAPTER 2. THE SCOLIAE.    Were strength to take precedence over the other zoological attributes,  the Scoliae would hold a predominant place in the front rank of the  Wasps. Some of them may be compared in size with the little bird from  the north, the Golden-crested Wren, who comes to us at the time of the  first autumn mists and visits the rotten buds. The largest and most  imposing of our sting-bearers, the Carpenter-bee, the Bumble-bee, the  Hornet, cut a poor figure beside certain of the Scoliae. Of this group  of giants my district possesses the Garden Scolia (S. hortorum, VAN DER  LIND), who is over an inch and a half in length and measures four inches  from tip to tip of her outspread wings, and the Hemorrhoidal Scolia (S.  haemorrhoidalis, VAN DER LIND), who rivals the Garden Scolia in point of  size and is distinguished more particularly by the bundle of red hairs  bristling at the tip of the abdomen.    A black livery, with broad yellow patches; leathery wings,  amber-coloured, like the skin of an onion, and watered with purple  reflections; thick, knotted legs, covered with sharp hairs; a massive  frame; a powerful head, encased in a hard cranium; a stiff, clumsy gait;  a low, short, silent flight: this gives you a concise description of the  female, who is strongly equipped for her arduous task. The male, being a  mere philanderer, sports a more elegant pair of horns, is more daintily  clad and has a more graceful figure, without altogether losing the  quality of robustness which is his consort's leading characteristic.    It is not without a certain alarm that the insect-collector finds  himself for the first time confronted by the Garden Scolia. How is he to  capture the imposing creature, how to avoid its sting? If its effect  is in proportion to the Wasp's size, the sting of the Scolia must be  something terrible. The Hornet, though she unsheath her weapon but  once, causes the most exquisite pain. What would it be like if one were  stabbed by this colossus? The prospect of a swelling as big as a man's  fist and as painful as the touch of a red-hot iron passes through our  mind at the moment when we are bringing down the net. And we refrain,  we beat a retreat, we are greatly relieved not to have aroused the  dangerous creature's attention.    Yes, I confess to having run away from my first Scoliae, anxious though  I was to enrich my budding collection with this magnificent insect.  There were painful recollections of the Common Wasp and the Hornet  "]]]
