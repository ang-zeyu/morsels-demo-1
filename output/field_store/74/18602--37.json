I wonder  how he would have managed his bushy tail in swimming, and how funny it  would have looked with the long hair all wet and sticking together!  Perhaps he thought of this himself. At any rate, he did not jump into  the water just then, but remained looking down from his hiding-place in  the willow-tree, very much pleased with what he had hitherto seen of  these clever divers and swimmers.    \"Well,\" said he to himself, \"they don't eat their own young ones, that  is clear enough; but how they might treat any other small animal that  came in their way I cannot possibly tell. And yet the great old rat  that frightened poor Gotobed so terribly, behaved very well, I am sure;  but then perhaps he was not hungry just then, and only asked him to  come again and be taught to swim that he might make a meal of him  another time. So I won't have anything to say to them just yet. Perhaps  if I wait here a little longer, I may see something that will decide  the matter.\"    And the matter _was_ decided, sooner than Brush expected. At a little  distance from the water-rats' station, he now perceived a most singular  looking animal, which was quite a stranger to him, though he had a  pretty large acquaintance among his neighbours. It was about the size  of a common mouse, but of a deep velvety black above, and white  underneath, and its nose was very long and pointed, like the snout of  a pig. His eyes were very small indeed, and looked like little black  beads deeply set in his head.    This curious, but beautiful little animal behaved exactly like a person  who knows that he has a great deal of work to get through in a very  short time. I mean, that he was very diligent and active, and seemed  determined not to lose a moment by stopping to rest himself, or to  consider what he should do next. He appeared to be an excellent swimmer  and diver, thrusting his long nose under the leaves at the bottom of  the water, in search of insects I suppose, and when he came to the  surface again, his fur was quite dry, like that of the water-rats. So  when he dived, this water-repelling property in his fur made him appear  of a beautiful silvery white colour, from the number of small air  bubbles he carried down with him. He was never still for a moment,  either diving to the bottom, or swimming, with a very quick wriggling  motion on the surface, and every now and then he would come to the  shore, from which he seldom ventured very far.    \"A very queer little fellow indeed, upon my word!\" said Brush, \"I  wonder who he is. I cannot help liking him though, for he seems so  clever and industrious. Oh dear me! how I wish I could dive in that  beautiful clear water! But I declare he is coming nearer and nearer  every minute to that old rat, who is so busy gnawing his root. Now,  when the little one passes him, we shall see what will happen. I am  sure the old rat must be terribly hungry, or he would not gnaw that  disagreeable looking root so eagerly, and if he does not pounce upon  the little black fellow, and tear him to pieces, I shall be very much  astonished indeed.\"    The squirrel was not long kept in suspense, for just as he had finished  talking the matter over to himself, the little velvet-coated swimmer,  intent upon his own important business, came paddling along very near  the shore, and at last landed quite close to the spot where the rat was  still engaged with his root. But when he perceived the visitor, he  immediately left off eating, and slowly turned his head towards him!    [Illustration: THE WATER-RAT AND WATER-SHREWMOUSE. Page 61.]    \"Horrible! he'll have him now! 'Tis all over with him,\" said Brush,  quite trembling with eagerness to see the end of the affair. \"'Tis all  over with the little black fellow, and these rats are rascals after  all!\"    But he was very much mistaken, for the only animal that lost its life  upon the occasion, was a small insect, which the bead-like eyes of  little velvet-coat had perceived crawling upon a stone, near the  water's edge, and in his eagerness to secure this valuable prize, I  suppose he did not observe that such a large fierce-looking creature  was close by, or perhaps he had found from experience that there was  nothing to fear from him. However, the little fellow boldly seized his  prey, and darted off with it into the water, while the quiet old  gentleman went on munching his root again.    Now when Brush witnessed this peaceable meeting of the two animals,  proving that water-rats were not the cruel, savage tempered creatures,  they are generally supposed to be, he was so delighted, that he quite  forgot that he had intended to have been a concealed spectator of their  proceedings. So he called out as loud as he could,--    \"Capital, I declare! 'Tis all a lie from beginning to end. Little  Gotobed was right after all. They _are_ a very decent, quiet set, as  he said.\"    But this expression of his sentiments quite interrupted the peaceable  employments of the company below, for the loud strange voice nearly  over their heads frightened them so, that they all either dived under  water, or retreated into their holes. However, the squirrel had now  satisfied his curiosity, and as he was rather frightened himself at  the disturbance he had made, he hastily leaped down from his hiding-place,  and scampered home to his nest. As for little velvet-coat, I never  heard what became of him, but no doubt he found a place to hide  himself in. But I believe I have never told you who he was. He was a  _water-shrewmouse_,[3] and very much like the common shrewmouse that  we often find lying dead in lanes and pathways. But he was larger  than the common shrewmouse, and altogether a much handsomer animal.          [3] Though this beautiful and interesting little animal, the        water-shrewmouse, was for a long time almost unnoticed by the        naturalists of this country, it cannot be considered as a rare        species. Bell, in his History of British Quadrupeds, informs us,        that it is not uncommon in many parts of England, and he says,        that its black velvet-like fur and long snout have sometimes        given rise to an opinion, that it is a small species of mole, to        which animal its structure and habits indicate a near affinity.          CHAPTER IV.      When Brush gave an account of all that he had seen to his partner, who  was of a much more cautious disposition than himself, he was rather  vexed that she still seemed not quite convinced that these water-rats  were such peaceable, good-tempered animals as he believed them to be.  It was very tiresome, to be sure, but she _would_ keep on relating  all the foolish old tales she had ever heard about their killing other  animals, and even their own children. We all know how disagreeable it  is when we have been taking a great deal of trouble to persuade other  people to think like ourselves on any subject, to find at last, after  half-an-hour's talking, that they are just as much attached to their  own opinions as ever. Now our squirrel was really a very good-tempered  fellow in general, but I must confess that he was rather cross on this  occasion; and though he did not say much about it, he showed that he  was \"a little out of sorts,\" as people say, by curling himself up for  the night fully half an hour before his usual time of going to sleep.    But the next morning he awoke in a very good-humoured mood indeed, and  worked hard all day with his companion, to complete the nest. He seemed  to have forgotten the subject of their dispute, till towards evening,  when, as he was sitting alone on a branch of the oak, on the side  nearest the pond, a _bat_ suddenly fluttered by, skimming with zigzag  flight over the still water.    \"There goes old Leatherwing, I declare!\" exclaimed Brush: \"the very  person I was wishing to see! I'll call out to him to stop the next time  he passes, and ask him to set me right about those water-rats. He is a  very learned old fellow, and I believe knows something about every  animal in the woods. To be sure, old Leatherwing is often rather  tiresome and prosy, and he _will_ talk a great deal about his own  affairs; but then he is a very clever old gentleman for all that, and  has seen a great deal of the world.\"    For some time Leatherwing continued flying backwards and forwards, over  the upper end of the pond, and seemed determined not to approach the  oak-tree. The truth is, that his game, which consisted of gnats and  other small insects, was abundant just at that spot, and a very hearty  supper he made that evening. I suppose he found the legs and wings of  these insects rather dry food, for sometimes, as he skimmed over the  water, he would dip in like a swallow, and drink a few drops as he  passed, in order to wash them down.    While he is eating his supper, I intend to give you a short, and I hope  not a very uninteresting description of his curious wings. As for his  habits and manner of passing his time, I dare say that he will take  care to say something upon that subject himself, when he gets into  conversation with Brush, who has just informed us that \"old Leatherwing  _will_ talk a great deal about his own affairs.\"    Almost every person, whether living in the town or country, must often  have observed the bat flitting about trees and houses in a calm summer  evening, but many have never taken the trouble to examine him more  closely, or have not had an opportunity of doing so. To form a proper  idea of the structure of the bat's wings you must understand, that his  fore-legs, or his _arms_, as I will call them, are almost as long as  his body, and that all the four fingers of his hands are _quite as  long as his arms_.
