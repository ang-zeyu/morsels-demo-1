Some few freed slaves take service in vessels, of which they are  especially fond; but most return to Africa to trade in slaves and ivory.  All slaves learn the coast language, called at Zanzibar Kisuahili; and  therefore the traveller, if judicious in his selections, could find  there interpreters to carry him throughout the eastern half of South  Africa. To the north of the equator the system of language entirely  changes.    Laziness is inherent in these men, for which reason, although extremely  powerful, they will not work unless compelled to do so. Having no God,  in the Christian sense of the term, to fear or worship, they have no  love for truth, honour, or honesty. Controlled by no government, nor yet  by home ties, they have no reason to think of or look to the future. Any  venture attracts them when hard-up for food; and the more roving it is,  the better they like it. The life of the sailor is most particularly  attractive to the freed slave; for he thinks, in his conceit, that he is  on an equality with all men when once on the muster-rolls, and then he  calls all his fellow-Africans \"savages.\" Still the African's peculiarity  sticks to him: he has gained no permanent good. The association of white  men and the glitter of money merely dazzle him. He apes like a monkey  the jolly Jack Tar, and spends his wages accordingly. If chance brings  him back again to Zanzibar, he calls his old Arab master his father, and  goes into slavery with as much zest as ever.    I have spoken of these freed men as if they had no religion. This  is practically true, though theoretically not so; for the Arabs, on  circumcising them, teach them to repeat the words Allah and Mohammed,  and perhaps a few others; but not one in ten knows what a soul means,  nor do they expect to meet with either reward or punishment in the next  world, though they are taught to regard animals as clean and unclean,  and some go through the form of a pilgrimage to Mecca. Indeed the whole  of their spiritual education goes into oaths and ejaculations--Allah and  Mohammed being as common in their mouths as damn and blast are with  our soldiers and sailors. The long and short of this story is, that the  freed men generally turn out a loose, roving, reckless set of beings,  quick-witted as the Yankee, from the simple fact that they imagine all  political matters affect them, and therefore they must have a word in  every debate. Nevertheless they are seldom wise; and lying being more  familiar to their constitution than truth-saying, they are for ever  concocting dodges with the view, which they glory in of successfully  cheating people. Sometimes they will show great kindness, even bravery  amounting to heroism, and proportionate affection; at another time,  without any cause, they will desert and be treacherous to their sworn  friends in the most dastardly manner. Whatever the freak of the moment  is, that they adopt in the most thoughtless manner, even though they may  have calculated on advantages beforehand in the opposite direction. In  fact, no one can rely upon them even for a moment. Dog wit, or any  silly remarks, will set them giggling. Any toy will amuse them. Highly  conceited of their personal appearance, they are for ever cutting their  hair in different fashions, to surprise a friend; or if a rag be thrown  away, they will all in turn fight for it to bind on their heads, then  on their loins or spears, peacocking about with it before their admiring  comrades. Even strange feathers or skins are treated by them in the same  way.    Should one happen to have anything specially to communicate to his  master in camp, he will enter giggling, sidle up to the pole of a  hut, commence scratching his back with it, then stretch and yawn, and  gradually, in bursts of loud laughter, slip down to the ground on his  stern, when he drums with his hands on the top of a box until summoned  to know what he has at heart, when he delivers himself in a peculiar  manner, laughs and yawns again, and, saying it is time to go, walks off  in the same way as he came. At other times when he is called, he will  come sucking away at the spout of a tea-pot, or, scratching his naked  arm-pits with a table-knife, or, perhaps, polishing the plates for  dinner with his dirty loin-cloth. If sent to market to purchase a  fowl, he comes back with a cock tied by the legs to the end of a stick,  swinging and squalling in the most piteous manner. Then, arrived at the  cook-shop, he throws the bird down on the ground, holds its head between  his toes, plucks the feathers to bare its throat, and then, raising a  prayer, cuts its head off.    But enough of the freed man in camp; on the march he is no better.  If you give him a gun and some ammunition to protect him in case of  emergencies, he will promise to save it, but forthwith expends it by  firing it off in the air, and demands more, else he will fear to venture  amongst the \"savages.\" Suppose you give him a box of bottles to carry,  or a desk, or anything else that requires great care, and you caution  him of its contents, the first thing he does is to commence swinging it  round and round, or putting it topsy-turvy on the top of his head,  when he will run off at a jog-trot, singing and laughing in the most  provoking manner, and thinking no more about it than if it were an old  stone; even if rain were falling, he would put it in the best place to  get wet through. Economy, care, or forethought never enters his head;  the first thing to hand is the right thing for him; and rather then take  the trouble even to look for his own rope to tie up his bundle, he would  cut off his master's tent-ropes or steal his comrade's. His greatest  delight is in the fair sex, and when he can't get them, next comes beer,  song, and a dance.    Now, this is a mild specimen of the \"rowdy\" negro, who has contributed  more to open Africa to enterprise and civilisation than any one else.  Possessed of a wonderful amount of loquacity, great risibility, but  no stability--a creature of impulse--a grown child, in short--at first  sight it seems wonderful how he can be trained to work; for there is now  law, no home to bind him--he could run away at any moment; and  presuming on this, he sins, expecting to be forgiven. Great forbearance,  occasionally tinctured with a little fatherly severity, is I believe,  the best dose for him; for he says to his master, in the most childish  manner, after sinning, \"You ought to forgive and to forget; for are you  not a big man who should be above harbouring spite, though for a moment  you may be angry? Flog me if you like, but don't keep count against me,  else I shall run away; and what will you do then?\"    The language of this people is just as strange as they are themselves.  It is based on euphony, from which cause it is very complex, the more  especially so as it requires one to be possessed of a negro's turn of  mind to appreciate the system, and unravel the secret of its euphonic  concord. A Kisuahili grammar, written by Dr. Krapf, will exemplify what  I mean. There is one peculiarity, however, to which I would direct the  attention of the reader most particularly, which is, that Wa prefixed to  the essential word of a country, means men or people; M prefixed, means  man or individual; U, in the same way, means place or locality; and  Ki prefixed indicates the language. Example:--Wagogo, is the people of  Gogo; Mgogo, is a Gogo man; Ugogo, is the country of Gogo; and Kigogo,  the language of Gogo.    The only direction here necessary as regards pronunciation of native  words refers to the u, which represents a sound corresponding to that of  the oo in woo.

My third expedition in Africa, which was avowedly for the purpose of  establishing the truth of my assertion that the Victoria N'yanza, which  I discovered on the 30th July 1858, would eventually prove to be the  source of the Nile, may be said to have commenced on the 9th May 1859,  the first day after my return to England from my second expedition,  when, at the invitation of Sir. R. I. Murchison, I called at his  house to show him my map for the information of the Royal Geographical  Society. Sir Roderick, I need only say, at once accepted my views; and,  knowing my ardent desire to prove to the world, by actual inspection of  the exit, that the Victoria N'yanza was the source of the Nile, seized  the enlightened view, that such a discovery should not be lost to the  glory of England and the Society of which he was President; and said  to me, \"Speke, we must send you there again.\" I was then officially  directed, much against my own inclination, to lecture at the Royal  Geographical Society on the geography of Africa, which I had, as the  sole surveyor of the second expedition, laid down on our maps. [4] A  council of the Geographical Society was now convened to ascertain what  projects I had in view for making good my discovery by connecting the  lake with the Nile, as also what assistance I should want for that  purpose.    Some thought my best plan would be to go up the Nile, which seemed to  them the natural course to pursue, especially as the Nile was said,  though nobody believed it, to have been navigated by expeditions sent  out by Mehemet Ali, Viceroy of Egypt, up to 3 deg. 22' north latitude. To  this I objected, as so many had tried it and failed, from reasons which  had not transpired; and, at the same time, I said that if they would  give me oe5000 down "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],[0,"The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#4)"],[1," and  knocking his head with a thud against the wall. Before he could strike  again he was thrown against his enemy, who clutched him and held like a  vice.        CHAPTER II    VENGEANCE IS MINE      The Glengarry men had fought their fight, and it only remained for their  foes to wreak their vengeance upon them and wipe out old scores. One  minute more would have done for them, but in that minute the door came  crashing in. There was a mighty roar, \"Glengarry! Glengarry!\" and the  great Macdonald himself, with the boy Ranald and some half-dozen of  his men behind him, stood among them. On all hands the fight stopped. A  moment he stood, his great head and shoulders towering above the crowd,  his tawny hair and beard falling around his face like a great mane, his  blue eyes gleaming from under his shaggy eyebrows like livid lightning.  A single glance around the room, and again raising his battle-cry,  \"Glengarry!\" he seized the nearest shrinking Frenchman, lifted him high,  and hurled him smashing into the bottles behind the counter. His men,  following him, bounded like tigers on their prey. A few minutes of  fierce, eager fighting, and the Glengarry men were all freed and on  their feet, all except Black Hugh, who lay groaning in his corner.  \"Hold, lads!\" Macdonald Bhain cried, in his mighty voice. \"Stop, I'm  telling you.\" The fighting ceased.    \"Dan Murphy!\" he cried, casting his eye round the room, \"where are you,  ye son of Belial?\"    Murphy, crouching at the back of the crowd near the door, sought to  escape.    \"Ah! there you are!\" cried Macdonald, and reaching through the crowd  with his great, long arm, he caught Murphy by the hair of the head and  dragged him forward.    \"R-r-r-a-a-t! R-r-r-a-a-t! R-r-r-a-a-t!\" he snarled, shaking him till  his teeth rattled. \"It is yourself that is the cause of this wickedness.  Now, may the Lord have mercy on your soul.\" With one hand he gripped  Murphy by the throat, holding him at arm's length, and raised his huge  fist to strike. But before the blow fell he paused.    \"No!\" he muttered, in a disappointed tone, \"it is not good enough. I  will not be demeaning myself. Hence, you r-r-a-a-t!\" As he spoke he  lifted the shaking wretch as if he had been a bundle of clothes, swung  him half round and hurled him crashing through the window.    \"Is there no goot man here at all who will stand before me?\" he raged  in a wild, joyous fury. \"Will not two of you come forth, then?\" No one  moved. \"Come to me!\" he suddenly cried, and snatching two of the enemy,  he dashed their heads together, and threw them insensible on the floor.    Then he caught sight of his brother for the first time lying in the  corner with Big Mack supporting his head, and LeNoir standing near.    \"What is this? What is this?\" he cried, striding toward LeNoir. \"And is  it you that has done this work?\" he asked, in a voice of subdued rage.    \"Oui!\" cried LeNoir, stepping back and putting up his hands, \"das me;  Louis LeNoir! by Gar!\" He struck himself on the breast as he spoke.    \"Out of my way!\" cried Macdonald, swinging his open hand on the  Frenchman's ear. With a swift sweep he brushed LeNoir aside from his  place, and ignoring him stooped over his brother. But LeNoir was no  coward, and besides his boasted reputation was at stake. He thought  he saw his chance, and rushing at Macdonald as he was bending over his  brother, delivered his terrible 'lash'. But Macdonald had not lived with  and fought with Frenchmen all these years without knowing their tricks  and ways. He saw LeNoir's 'lash' coming, and quickly turning his head,  avoided the blow.    \"Ah! would ye? Take that, then, and be quate!\" and so saying, he caught  LeNoir on the side of the head and sent him to the floor.    \"Keep him off a while, Yankee!\" said Macdonald, for LeNoir was up again,  and coming at him.    Then kneeling beside his brother he wiped the bloody froth that was  oozing from his lips, and said in a low, anxious tone:    \"Hugh, bhodaich (old man), are ye hurted? Can ye not speak to me, Hugh?\"    \"Oich-oh,\" Black Hugh groaned. \"It was a necessity--Donald man--and--he  took me--unawares--with his--keeck.\"    \"Indeed, and I'll warrant you!\" agreed his brother, \"but I will be  attending to him, never you fear.\"    Macdonald was about to rise, when his brother caught his arm.    \"You will--not be--killing him,\" he urged, between his painful gasps,  \"because I will be doing that myself some day, by God's help.\"    His words and the eager hate in his face seemed to quiet Macdonald.    \"Alas! alas!\" he said, sadly, \"it is not allowed me to smite him as  he deserves--'Vengeance is mine saith the Lord,' and I have solemnly  promised the minister not to smite for glory or for revenge! Alas!  alas!\"    Then turning to LeNoir, he said, gravely: \"It is not given me to punish  you for your coward's blow. Go from me!\" But LeNoir misjudged him.    \"Bah!\" he cried, contemptuously, \"you tink me one baby, you strike me on  de head side like one little boy. Bon! Louis LeNware, de bes bully on de  Hottawa, he's not 'fraid for hany man, by Gar!\" He pranced up and down  before Macdonald, working himself into a great rage, as Macdonald grew  more and more controlled.    Macdonald turned to his men with a kind of appeal--\"I hev given my  promise, and Macdonald will not break his word.\"    \"Bah!\" cried LeNoir, spitting at him.    \"Now may the Lord give me grace to withstand the enemy,\" said Macdonald,  gravely, \"for I am greatly moved to take vengeance upon you.\"    \"Bah!\" cried LeNoir again, mistaking Macdonald's quietness and  self-control for fear. \"You no good! Your brother is no good! Beeg  sheep! Beeg sheep! Bah!\"    \"God help me,\" said Macdonald as if to himself. \"I am a man of grace!  But must this dog go unpunished?\"    LeNoir continued striding up and down, now and then springing high in  the air and knocking his heels together with blood-curdling yells.  He seemed to feel that Macdonald would not fight, and his courage and  desire for blood grew accordingly.    \"Will you not be quate?\" said Macdonald, rising after a few moments from  his brother's side, where he had been wiping his lips and giving him  water to drink. \"You will be better outside.\"    \"Oui! you strike me on the head side. Bon! I strike you de same way! By  Gar!\" so saying he approached Macdonald lightly, and struck him a slight  blow on the cheek.    \"Ay,\" said Macdonald, growing white and rigid. \"I struck you twice,  LeNoir. Here!\" he offered the other side of his face. LeNoir danced up  carefully, made a slight pass, and struck the offered cheek.    \"Now, that is done, will it please you to do it again?\" said Macdonald,  with earnest entreaty in his voice. LeNoir must have been mad with his  rage and vanity, else he had caught the glitter in the blue eyes looking  through the shaggy hair. Again LeNoir approached, this time with greater  confidence, and dealt Macdonald a stinging blow on the side of the head.    \"Now the Lord be praised,\" he cried, joy breaking out in his face. \"He  has delivered my enemy into my hand. For it is the third time he has  smitten me, and that is beyond the limit appointed by Himself.\" With  this he advanced upon LeNoir with a glad heart. His conscience was clear  at last.    LeNoir stood up against his antagonist. He well knew he was about to  make the fight of his life. He had beaten men as big as Macdonald, but  he knew that his hope lay in keeping out of the enemy's reach. So he  danced around warily. Macdonald followed him slowly. LeNoir opened with  a swift and savage reach for Macdonald's neck, but failed to break the  guard and danced out again, Macdonald still pressing on him. Again  and again LeNoir rushed, but the guard was impregnable, and steadily  Macdonald advanced. That steady, relentless advance began to tell on the  Frenchman's nerves. The sweat gathered in big drops on his forehead and  ran down his face. He prepared for a supreme effort. Swiftly retreating,  he lured Macdonald to a more rapid advance, then with a yell he doubled  himself into a ball and delivered himself head, hands, and feet into  Macdonald's stomach. It is a trick that sometimes avails to break an  unsteady guard and to secure a clinch with an unwary opponent. But  Macdonald had been waiting for that trick. Stopping short, he leaned  over to one side, and stooping slightly, caught LeNoir low and tossed  him clear over his head. LeNoir fell with a terrible thud on his back,  but was on his feet again like a cat and ready for the ever-advancing  Macdonald. But though he had not been struck a single blow he knew that  he had met his master. That unbreakable guard, the smiling face with the  gleaming, unsmiling eyes, that awful unwavering advance, were too much  for him. He was pale, his breath came in quick gasps, and his eyes  showed the fear of a hunted beast. He prepared for a final effort.  Feigning a greater distress than he felt, he yielded weakly to  Macdonald's advance, then suddenly gathering his full strength he sprang  into the air and lashed out backward at that hated, smiling face. His  boot found its mark, not on Macdonald's face, but fair on his neck. The  effect was terrific. Macdonald staggered back two or three paces, but  before LeNoir could be at him, he had recovered sufficiently to maintain  his guard, and shake off his foe. At the yell that went up from Murphy's  men, the big Highlander's face lost its smile and became keen and cruel,  his eyes glittered with the flash of steel and he came forward once more  with a quick, light tread. His great body seemed to lose both size and  weight, so lightly did he step on tiptoe. There was no more pause, but  lightly, swiftly, and eagerly he glided upon LeNoir. There was something  terrifying in that swift, cat-like movement. In vain the Frenchman  backed and dodged and tried to guard. Once, twice, Macdonald's fists  fell. LeNoir's right arm hung limp by his side and he staggered"]]]
