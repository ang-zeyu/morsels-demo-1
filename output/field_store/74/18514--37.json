With respect to the eye itself, the highest authority in England, Mr.      Bowman, has been so kind as to give me the following remarks on certain      inherited imperfections. First, hypermetropia, or morbidly long sight:      in this affection, the organ, instead of being spherical, is too flat      from front to back, and is often altogether too small, so that the      retina is brought too forward for the focus of the humours;      consequently a convex glass is required for clear vision of near      objects, and frequently even of distant ones. This state occurs      congenitally, or at a very early age, often in several children of the      same family, where one of the parents has presented it.[16] Secondly,      myopia, or short-sight, in which the eye is egg-shaped, and too long      from front to back; the retina in this case lies behind the focus, and      is therefore fitted to see distinctly only very near objects. This      condition is not commonly congenital, but comes on in youth, the      liability to it being well known to be transmissible from parent to      child. The change from the spherical to the ovoidal shape seems the      immediate {9} consequence of something like inflammation of the coats,      under which they yield, and there is ground for believing that it may      often originate in causes acting directly on the individual affected,      and may thenceforward become transmissible. When both parents are      myopic Mr. Bowman has observed the hereditary tendency in this      direction to be heightened, and some of the children to be myopic at an      earlier age or in a higher degree than their parents. Thirdly,      squinting is a familiar example of hereditary transmission: it is      frequently a result of such optical defects as have been above      mentioned; but the more primary and uncomplicated forms of it are also      sometimes in a marked degree transmitted in a family. Fourthly,      _Cataract_, or opacity of the crystalline lens, is commonly observed in      persons whose parents have been similarly affected, and often at an      earlier age in the children than in the parents. Occasionally more than      one child in a family is thus afflicted, one of whose parents or other      relation presents the senile form of the complaint. When cataract      affects several members of a family in the same generation, it is often      seen to commence at about the same age in each; _e.g._, in one family      several infants or young persons may suffer from it; in another,      several persons of middle age. Mr. Bowman also informs me that he has      occasionally seen, in several members of the same family, various      defects in either the right or left eye; and Mr. White Cooper has often      seen peculiarities of vision confined to one eye reappearing in the      same eye in the offspring.[17]        The following cases are taken from an able paper by Mr. W. Sedgwick,      and from Dr. Prosper Lucas.[18] Amaurosis, either congenital or coming      on late in life, and causing total blindness, is often inherited; it      has been observed in three successive generations. Congenital absence      of the iris has likewise been transmitted for three generations, a      cleft-iris for four generations, being limited in this latter case to      the males of the family. Opacity of the cornea and congenital smallness      of the eyes have been inherited. Portal records a curious case, in      which a father and two sons were rendered blind, whenever the head was      bent downwards, apparently owing to the crystalline lens, with its      capsule, slipping through an unusually large pupil into the anterior      chamber of the eye. Day-blindness, or imperfect vision under a bright      light, is inherited, as is night-blindness, or an incapacity to see      except under a strong light: a case has been recorded, by M. Cunier, of      this latter defect having affected eighty-five members of the same      family during six generations. The singular incapacity of      distinguishing colours, which has been called _Daltonism_, is      notoriously hereditary, and has been traced through five generations,      in which it was confined to the female sex.        With respect to the colour of the iris: deficiency of colouring matter      is well known to be hereditary in albinoes. The iris of one eye being      of a different colour from that of the other, and the iris being      spotted, are cases which have been inherited. Mr. Sedgwick gives, in      addition, on the {10} authority of Dr. Osborne,[19] the following      curious instance of strong inheritance: a family of sixteen sons and      five daughters all had eyes \"resembling in miniature the markings on      the back of a tortoiseshell cat.\" The mother of this large family had      three sisters and a brother all similarly marked, and they derived this      peculiarity from their mother, who belonged to a family notorious for      transmitting it to their posterity.        Finally, Dr. Lucas emphatically remarks that there is not one single      faculty of the eye which is not subject to anomalies; and not one which      is not subjected to the principle of inheritance. Mr. Bowman agrees      with the general truth of this proposition; which of course does not      imply that all malformations are necessarily inherited; this would not      even follow if both parents were affected by an anomaly which in most      cases was transmissible.    Even if no single fact had been known with respect to the inheritance of  disease and malformations by man, the evidence would have been ample in the  case of the horse. And this might have been expected, as horses breed much  quicker than man, are matched with care, and are highly valued. I have  consulted many works, and the unanimity of the belief by veterinaries of  all nations in the transmission of various morbid tendencies is surprising.  Authors, who have had wide experience, give in detail many singular cases,  and assert that contracted feet, with the numerous contingent evils, of  ring-bones, curbs, splints, spavin, founder and weakness of the front legs,  roaring or broken and thick wind, melanosis, specific ophthalmia, and  blindness (the great French veterinary Hazard going so far as to say that a  blind race could soon be formed), crib-biting, jibbing, and ill-temper, are  all plainly hereditary. Youatt sums up by saying \"there is scarcely a  malady to which the horse is subject which is not hereditary;\" and M.  Bernard adds that the doctrine \"that there is scarcely a disease which does  not run in the stock, is gaining new advocates every day.\"[20] So it {11}  is in regard to cattle, with consumption, good and bad teeth, fine skin,  &c. &c. But enough, and more than enough, has been said on disease. Andrew  Knight, from his own experience, asserts that disease is hereditary with  plants; and this assertion is endorsed by Lindley.[21]    Seeing how hereditary evil qualities are, it is fortunate that good health,  vigour, and longevity are equally inherited. It was formerly a well-known  practice, when annuities were purchased to be received during the lifetime  of a nominee, to search out a person belonging to a family of which many  members had lived to extreme old age. As to the inheritance of vigour and  endurance, the English race-horse offers an excellent instance. Eclipse  begot 334, and King Herod 497 winners. A \"cock-tail\" is a horse not purely  bred, but with only one-eighth or one-sixteenth impure blood in his veins,  yet very few instances have ever occurred of such horses having won a great  race. They are sometimes as fleet for short distances as thoroughbreds, but  as Mr. Robson, the great trainer, asserts, they are deficient in wind, and  cannot keep up the pace. Mr. Lawrence also remarks, \"perhaps no instance  has ever occurred of a three-part-bred horse saving his '_distance_' in  running two miles with thoroughbred racers.\" It has been stated by Cecil,  that when unknown horses, whose parents were not celebrated, have  unexpectedly won great races, as in the case of Priam, they can always be  proved to be descended on both sides, through many generations, from  first-rate ancestors. On the Continent, Baron Cameronn challenges, in a  German veterinary periodical, the opponents of the English race-horse, to  name one good horse on the Continent which has not some English race-blood  in his veins.[22]    With respect to the transmission of the many slight, but {12} infinitely  diversified characters, by which the domestic races of animals and plants  are distinguished, nothing need be said; for the very existence of  persistent races proclaims the power of inheritance.    A few special cases, however, deserve some consideration. It might have  been anticipated, that deviations from the law of symmetry would not have  been inherited. But Anderson[23] states that a rabbit produced in a litter  a young animal having only one ear; and from this animal a breed was formed  which steadily produced one-eared rabbits. He also mentions a bitch, with a  single leg deficient, and she produced several puppies with the same  deficiency. From Hofacker's account[24] it appears that a one-horned stag  was seen in 1781 in a forest in Germany, in 1788 two, and afterwards, from  year to year, many were observed with only one horn on the right side of  the head. A cow lost a horn by suppuration,[25] and she produced three  calves which had on the same side of the head, instead of a horn, a small  bony lump attached merely to the skin; but we here approach the doubtful  subject of inherited mutilations. A man who is left-handed, and a shell in  which the spire turns in the wrong direction, are departures from the  normal though a symmetrical condition, and they are well known to be  inherited.        _Polydactylism._--Supernumerary fingers and toes are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2892"],[0,"Irish Fairy Tales (#4)"],[1,"and gust and swirl; the wild  cat fished for me; the hawk and the steep-winged, spear-beaked birds  dived down on me, and men crept on me with nets the width of a river,  so that I got no rest. My life became a ceaseless scurry and wound and  escape, a burden and anguish of watchfulness--and then I was caught.\"        CHAPTER XI    \"THE fisherman of Cairill, the King of Ulster, took me in his net. Ah,  that was a happy man when he saw me! He shouted for joy when he saw the  great salmon in his net.    \"I was still in the water as he hauled delicately. I was still in the  water as he pulled me to the bank. My nose touched air and spun from it  as from fire, and I dived with all my might against the bottom of the  net, holding yet to the water, loving it, mad with terror that I must  quit that loveliness. But the net held and I came up.    \"'Be quiet, King of the River,' said the fisherman, 'give in to Doom,'  said he.    \"I was in air, and it was as though I were in fire. The air pressed on  me like a fiery mountain. It beat on my scales and scorched them. It  rushed down my throat and scalded me. It weighed on me and squeezed me,  so that my eyes felt as though they must burst from my head, my head as  though it would leap from my body, and my body as though it would swell  and expand and fly in a thousand pieces.    \"The light blinded me, the heat tormented me, the dry air made me  shrivel and gasp; and, as he lay on the grass, the great salmon whirled  his desperate nose once more to the river, and leaped, leaped, leaped,  even under the mountain of air. He could leap upwards, but not forwards,  and yet he leaped, for in each rise he could see the twinkling waves,  the rippling and curling waters.    \"'Be at ease, O King,' said the fisherman. 'Be at rest, my beloved. Let  go the stream. Let the oozy marge be forgotten, and the sandy bed where  the shades dance all in green and gloom, and the brown flood sings  along.'    \"And as he carried me to the palace he sang a song of the river, and a  song of Doom, and a song in praise of the King of the Waters.    \"When the king's wife saw me she desired me. I was put over a fire and  roasted, and she ate me. And when time passed she gave birth to me, and  I was her son and the son of Cairill the king. I remember warmth and  darkness and movement and unseen sounds. All that happened I remember,  from the time I was on the gridiron until the time I was born. I forget  nothing of these things.\"    \"And now,\" said Finnian, \"you will be born again, for I shall baptize  you into the family of the Living God.\" ---- So far the story of Tuan,  the son of Cairill.    No man knows if he died in those distant ages when Finnian was Abbot of  Moville, or if he still keeps his fort in Ulster, watching all things,  and remembering them for the glory of God and the honour of Ireland.          THE BOYHOOD OF FIONN          He was a king, a seer and a poet. He was a lord with a manifold and  great train. He was our magician, our knowledgable one, our soothsayer.  All that he did was sweet with him. And, however ye deem my testimony  of Fionn excessive, and, although ye hold my praising overstrained,  nevertheless, and by the King that is above me, he was three times  better than all I say.--Saint PATRICK.          CHAPTER I    Fionn [pronounce Fewn to rhyme with \"tune\"] got his first training among  women. There is no wonder in that, for it is the pup's mother teaches it  to fight, and women know that fighting is a necessary art although men  pretend there are others that are better. These were the women druids,  Bovmall and Lia Luachra. It will be wondered why his own mother did not  train him in the first natural savageries of existence, but she could  not do it. She could not keep him with her for dread of the clann-Morna.  The sons of Morna had been fighting and intriguing for a long time to  oust her husband, Uail, from the captaincy of the Fianna of Ireland,  and they had ousted him at last by killing him. It was the only way  they could get rid of such a man; but it was not an easy way, for what  Fionn's father did not know in arms could not be taught to him even by  Morna. Still, the hound that can wait will catch a hare at last, and  even Manana'nn sleeps. Fionn's mother was beautiful, long-haired Muirne:  so she is always referred to. She was the daughter of Teigue, the son of  Nuada from Faery, and her mother was Ethlinn. That is, her brother  was Lugh of the Long Hand himself, and with a god, and such a god, for  brother we may marvel that she could have been in dread of Morna or his  sons, or of any one. But women have strange loves, strange fears, and  these are so bound up with one another that the thing which is presented  to us is not often the thing that is to be seen.    However it may be, when Uall died Muirne got married again to the King  of Kerry. She gave the child to Bovmall and Lia Luachra to rear, and we  may be sure that she gave injunctions with him, and many of them. The  youngster was brought to the woods of Slieve Bloom and was nursed there  in secret.    It is likely the women were fond of him, for other than Fionn there  was no life about them. He would be their life; and their eyes may  have seemed as twin benedictions resting on the small fair head. He was  fair-haired, and it was for his fairness that he was afterwards called  Fionn; but at this period he was known as Deimne. They saw the food they  put into his little frame reproduce itself length-ways and sideways in  tough inches, and in springs and energies that crawled at first, and  then toddled, and then ran. He had birds for playmates, but all the  creatures that live in a wood must have been his comrades. There would  have been for little Fionn long hours of lonely sunshine, when the world  seemed just sunshine and a sky. There would have been hours as long,  when existence passed like a shade among shadows, in the multitudinous  tappings of rain that dripped from leaf to leaf in the wood, and slipped  so to the ground. He would have known little snaky paths, narrow enough  to be filled by his own small feet, or a goat's; and he would have  wondered where they went, and have marvelled again to find that,  wherever they went, they came at last, through loops and twists of the  branchy wood, to his own door. He may have thought of his own door as  the beginning and end of the world, whence all things went, and whither  all things came.    Perhaps he did not see the lark for a long time, but he would have heard  him, far out of sight in the endless sky, thrilling and thrilling until  the world seemed to have no other sound but that clear sweetness; and  what a world it was to make that sound! Whistles and chirps, coos and  caws and croaks, would have grown familiar to him. And he could at last  have told which brother of the great brotherhood was making the noise  he heard at any moment. The wind too: he would have listened to its  thousand voices as it moved in all seasons and in all moods. Perhaps a  horse would stray into the thick screen about his home, and would look  as solemnly on Fionn as Fionn did on it. Or, coming suddenly on him,  the horse might stare, all a-cock with eyes and ears and nose, one  long-drawn facial extension, ere he turned and bounded away with  manes all over him and hoofs all under him and tails all round him. A  solemn-nosed, stern-eyed cow would amble and stamp in his wood to find a  flyless shadow; or a strayed sheep would poke its gentle muzzle through  leaves.    \"A boy,\" he might think, as he stared on a staring horse, \"a boy cannot  wag his tail to keep the flies off,\" and that lack may have saddened  him. He may have thought that a cow can snort and be dignified at  the one moment, and that timidity is comely in a sheep. He would have  scolded the jackdaw, and tried to out-whistle the throstle, and wondered  why his pipe got tired when the blackbird's didn't. There would be flies  to be watched, slender atoms in yellow gauze that flew, and filmy specks  that flittered, and sturdy, thick-ribbed brutes that pounced like cats  and bit like dogs and flew like lightning. He may have mourned for the  spider in bad luck who caught that fly. There would be much to see and  remember and compare, and there would be, always, his two guardians. The  flies change from second to second; one cannot tell if this bird is a  visitor or an inhabitant, and a sheep is just sister to a sheep; but the  women were as rooted as the house itself.        CHAPTER II    Were his nurses comely or harsh-looking? Fionn would not know. This was  the one who picked him up when he fell, and that was the one who patted  the bruise. This one said: \"Mind you do not tumble in the well!\"    And that one: \"Mind the little knees among the nettles.\"    But he did tumble and record that the only notable thing about a well  is that it is wet. And as for nettles, if they hit him he hit back. He  slashed into them with a stick and brought them low. There was nothing  in wells or nettles, only women dreaded them. One patronised women and  instructed them and comforted them, for they were afraid about one.    They thought that one should not climb a tree!    \"Next week,\" they said at last, \"you may climb this one,\" and \"next  week\" lived at the end of the world!    But the tree that was climbed was not worth while when it had been  climbed twice. There was a bigger one near by. There were trees that no  one could climb, with vast shadow on one side and vaster sunshine on  the other. It took a long time to walk round them, and you could not see  their tops.    It was pleasant to stand on a branch that swayed and sprung, and it was  good to stare at an impenetrable roof of leaves and then climb into it.  How wonderful the loneliness was up there! When he looked down there  was an undulating floor of leaves, green and green and greener to a very  blackness of greeniness; and when he looked up there"]]]
