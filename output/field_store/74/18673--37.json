From old time the Dutchman has employed his mountain fastnesses,  his boulders, and his tambookie grass as screens and shelters, till in  war the \"tricks of the trade\" have become a second nature to him, and  serve in place of more complicated European methods. The small Natal  army was, on Sir George Colley's principle, allowed to pit itself  against a fighting mass, dense and desultory it may be, but a fighting  mass of enormous dimensions, which, whatever their failings, had weight,  equipment, courage, obstinacy, and intimacy with their surroundings  entirely in their favour. That the enemy was first in the field they had  to thank the original promoters of war, the Peace party--the  humanitarian persons who so long hampered reason by loud outcries  against the shedding of blood that their own countrymen in the Transvaal  were condemned to all the tortures of suspense, to be aggravated later  by all the agonies of famine and disease. Their own countrywomen and  their babes were saved from shot and shell to be sent defenceless and  homeless to wander the world till the charity of strangers or the relief  of death should overtake them, while the loyal natives were left in a  state of trepidation and suspense, without protection, yet forbidden to  raise a hand in their own defence.    Reason now had its way. But remedies cannot be applied in a moment, and  the public, which is always wise after the event, vented its anguish and  its feelings of suspense by indulging in criticism, or in asking  questions which, of course, could not be answered till the principal  persons concerned were able to take part in the catechism. For instance,  some of the riddles buzzed about in club and railway carriage were: Why  did Sir Redvers Buller make a frontal attack across an open plain  against an enemy admirably entrenched, and posted in a position not only  made strong by art but by nature? Why was it that the Government, in  spite of the warnings given by Sir Alfred Milner while he was in England  in May '99, neglected to take such precautions as would have prevented  the enemy from being entirely in advance of us in the matter of time?  Why, also, were the Boers permitted to arm themselves with the most  expensive modern weapons, to be used against us, under the very eye of  our representative in Pretoria, without our being warned of the inferior  quality of our own guns, and of the impossibility of making ourselves a  match for the enemy so long as the cheese-paring policy of the  authorities at home was countenanced? Why, with an Intelligence  Department in working order, was it never discovered that united Free  State and Transvaal Dutchmen would vastly outnumber all the troops we  were prepared--or, rather, unprepared--to put in the field, the troops  we strove to make sufficient till the strain of reverse forced from us  the acceptance of help from the Colonies, the Militia, and the  Volunteers?    The great question of reinforcements filled all minds. Nothing indeed  could be looked for till they should reach the Cape. Fifteen huge  transports were due to arrive between the end of December and the  beginning of January, bringing on the scene some 15,000 troops of all  arms. The Fifth Division, under Sir Charles Warren, consisting of eight  battalions of Infantry and its complement of Artillery and Engineers was  expected, also the Household Cavalry Composite Regiment, the 14th  Hussars, a siege train, a draft of Marines, and various odd branches of  the service. Later on more troops would follow, but pending the arrival  of the warrior cargoes it was impossible for our Generals to do more  than act on the defensive, and consider themselves fortunate if they  could prevent the further advance of the enemy to the south.    But the most momentous move of the closing year was the departure of  Lord Roberts for the seat of war. Here was this gallant officer, whose  life had been devoted to the service of his country, and who was at an  age when many other men would have elected to stay by hearth and home,  suddenly called on to act in the most difficult and trying crisis. And,  in the very hour that he was asked to rouse himself to meet the call of  Queen and country, he was dealt a crushing blow. His gallant son, the  only one, and one well worthy to have worn the laurels of his noble  father, besides adding to them by his own splendid acts, was carried  off, a victim to the severe wound he received at Colenso. Here was a  supreme trial, so supreme indeed that none dared touch it. All, even  Lord Roberts's sincerest friends, shrunk from dwelling on the agony of  mind that must have been endured by this great hero when at the same  moment the voice of duty and the cry of domestic love jarred in  conflict. On the one side he was called upon to brace himself to meet a  political situation fraught with all manner of indescribable  complications, while on the other, human nature with a thousand clinging  tendrils drew him towards the numbness of mute woe or the consolation of  private tears. But, like the great warrior he is, he got into harness  and started off, leaving his misery in the hands of the great British  people, who held it as their own. The \"send off\" they gave him at  Waterloo Station was one of the most remarkable outbursts of public  feeling on record, and this was not only due to admiration for the  conqueror of Kandahar, but to profound sympathy for the man and the  father who was thus laying aside his private self and placing all his  magnificent ability at the service of the Empire.      DOINGS AT CHIEVELEY    It was now found desirable to remove part of the camp about ten and a  half miles to the south, to get out of range of the Boer big guns which  commanded the position. The wounded were daily being sent off in  train-loads to Maritzburg, many of them, in spite of being shot in two  or three places, cheerful and anxious to return quickly \"to be in at the  death,\" as they sportingly described it. The funeral of Lord Roberts's  gallant son caused a sense of deep depression to prevail in all ranks,  for he was not only regretted by those who held his brilliant qualities  in esteem, but in sympathy with the sore affliction which had befallen  the veteran \"Bobs,\" whose name, wherever Tommy goes, is one to conjure  with. The ceremony was a most impressive one, and the pall-bearers were  all men of young Roberts's corps. These were Major Prince Christian  Victor, Colonels Buchanan-Riddell and Bewicke-Copley, and Major  Stuart-Wortley.    The graves of all the unfortunate slain were marked round, covered with  flowers, and temporary tablets arranged till suitable memorials should  be prepared.    [Illustration: A PICKET OF 13th HUSSARS SURPRISED NEAR THE TUGELA RIVER  (HUSSAR HILL).    Drawing by John Charlton.]    Meanwhile the Naval guns were unceasing in their activity, and made an  appalling accompaniment to the afternoon siestas in which many,  owing to the excessive heat, were inclined to indulge. For strategical  reasons it was now found necessary to blow up the road-bridge over the  Tugela, and thus prevent the Boers from advancing further to the south  or spying upon our positions.    [Illustration: MAP OF THE SEAT OF WAR. Scale 1 inch=86 miles.]    Extra precautions were taken in regard to the white flag. It began to be  believed at last that the Boer would take an unfair advantage of the  Briton whenever he should get a chance. Strangely enough, our officers  seemed to have forgotten or disregarded the object-lesson of the tragic  affair of Bronker's Spruit. Yet Boer \"slimness\" was then well enough  established. The unfortunate Colonel Anstruther caused to be printed in  the Transvaal Government _Gazette_ a bi-lingual proclamation, informing  the Boers that, in consequence of the many treacherous uses to which the  white flag had been put, he would in future recognise the emblem only  under the following conditions: two Boers accompanied by an officer, and  all unarmed, must approach the lines bearing the white flag aloft. The  British soldiers were also advised to keep well under cover whenever the  flag was displayed. This showed that reliance on Boer honour would in no  case be attempted. At the present date Boer morality had not improved,  and it was even declared that the Free Staters had made their women boil  down their national flag, so that in its pallid state it might at a  little distance be mistaken for the white flag, and come in handy in  case of need.    On the 20th of December a picket, consisting of seven men belonging to  the 13th Hussars, was surprised some five miles from camp, in the  direction of Weenen, by a party of sixty Boers. These cautiously crept  round some kopjes to where the outpost was stationed. A smart tussle  ensued. Two men were killed and seven horses were lost. No sooner had  information of the fight reached camp than some of Bethune's and  Thorneycroft's Mounted Infantry were despatched to the rescue, but the  Boers, on perceiving these reinforcements, quickly fled and thus escaped  punishment.    At this time the second advance for the relief of Ladysmith was very  secretly being organised, but no one knew exactly when Sir Redvers  Buller meant to move, or whether he intended to give up the idea of a  frontal attack altogether. Our Generals were criticised for making  frontal attacks, but Clausewitz declares that the attempt to turn the  flank of the enemy can only be justified by a great superiority; this  superiority may be either actual superiority of numbers, or it may  follow from the way in which the lines of communication are placed.

With regard to your friends who are  staying in Paris, I have often seen, during this winter and  spring, the Leo family [August Leo, banker in Paris], and all  that follows. There have been evenings at certain ambassadresses'  houses, and there was not a single one at which somebody living  at Frankfort was not mentioned. Madame Eichthal sends you many  kind messages--Plater [Count Plater, Chopin's countryman, and a  friend also of Liszt], the whole family were very sorry for your  departure, and begged me to give you their condolences.) Madame  d'Apponyi [Apponyi, the Austrian ambassador in Paris] was very  much vexed with me for not having taken you there before your  departure; she hopes that when you come back you will be sure to  remember the promise you made me. I will say as much of a certain  lady who is not an ambassadress.

The latter  work made an unheard-of sensation, but brought upon him the  anathema of the Church. He obtained a great influence over Liszt,  who was on intimate terms with him.]    Four months have actually passed, dear Father, since we parted,  and I feel very sad at not getting a word from you!--at the same  time I do not wish to complain, for it seems to me that you can  never doubt my deep and filial affection...Much more, I even know  that you have been willing to accept it, and, however humble it  may be, to count it for something...What more then can I  desire?...    Eugene, whose brotherly friendship becomes dearer to me day by  day, has often given me good tidings of you. The last time I saw  him he told me confidentially that you were working at a sort of  Introduction, or developed Preface to your works.--Although I  know perfectly well that my interest counts for nothing in this  matter, I may be permitted nevertheless to tell you how glad I am  to know that you are occupied with this work. To yourself, first  of all, I think you owe it--your name and glory will shine out  all the more powerfully for it. And, secondly, for the public it  will be a work of art the more (and this commodity becomes rather  rare as time goes on), and which will besides have the double  advantage of aiding and fixing them in the understanding of your  past works, whilst at the same time preparing them for, and  initiating them into, your future thoughts.    And, lastly, for us who love you, and who would glory and be  proud to be one day called your disciples, we rejoice in it  because the world will learn to know you better by this means,  and because it will probably be another opportunity for us to  show our sympathetic admiration as well as our unalterable  devotion for you.    Unless something very unforeseen occurs, I shall come again and  beg you to receive me for a few days towards the middle of July;  I trust sufficiently to your sincerity to tell me that you would  rather not have me if my individuality would trouble or bother  you too much.--Before that, I shall have the honor of sending you  a little work, to which I have had the audacity to tack a great  name--yours.--It is an instrumental De profundis. The plain-song  that you like so much is preserved in it with the Faburden.  Perhaps this may give you a little pleasure, at any rate, I have  done it in remembrance of some hours passed (I should say  \"lived\") at La Chenaie.    Farewell, dear Father. I don't give you any news of Paris,--you  know all that. You know that Ballanche wants to be an  Academician, and accepts Salvandy and Dupaty as competitors,--you  know the little check of January,--the miserable petty intrigues  of court and newspaper and vestry;--in a word, you know how men  are wanting in noble and generous sentiments, and how they make  the most of their own ignoble ends and interests, to which their  words and actions yet give the lie.    Farewell once more, dear Father. Think as often as possible of  all the good you have done, and of that which men have a right to  expect of you. Think sometimes also of the help and the wealth of  affection that you have showered on me in particular, and may the  remembrance of this be sweet to you!...    Yours ever, for life--from heart and soul,    F. Liszt    January 14th, 1835    Tomorrow morning I have to leave for two months.

To his Mother    [From a copy, by Mr. Vladimir Stassoff of St. Petersburg, the  original of which is in Russia.

Simply put it in a cover, and put it in the post (General  Office), and I shall get it, at latest, by Monday or Tuesday.--    Address to Mr. Hermann Cohen, Grande Rue, No. 8.    [Cohen was a frequently mentioned pupil and favorite of Liszt's  who was born at Hamburg in 1820, much thought of as a pianist in  Paris, and immortalised as \"Puzzi\" by George Sand (\"Lettres d'un  Voyageur\"); he followed Liszt to Geneva, and gave lessons there.  In 1850 he entered the order of Carmelites, and, under the name  of Pater Augustin, died in Berlin in January 1871, whither he had  gone with French prisoners.]    I have an immense deal to do this morning, so that I have barely  time to tell you that I love you with all my heart, and that I  rejoice above everything at the prospect of seeing you again  soon--that is to say, in six or eight months.    F. Liszt    You will hear of me from Mr. Pinondel, who passed a day with us.        9. To the Abbe F. de Lamennais, La Chenaie    [Autograph in the possession of Mr. Marshall in London.]    [Paris, May 28th, 1836--according to the stamp of the post  office]    Dear and venerable Father,    I shall expect you. Whatever sorrow there is in the depth of my  soul, it will be sweet and consoling to me to see you again.    You are so wonderfully good to me! and I should suffer so much by  being so long away from you!--    Au revoir then, once more--in eight days at latest it will be,  will it not? I do nothing else than keep expecting you.    Yours, with the deepest respect and most sincere devotion,    F. Liszt        10.
