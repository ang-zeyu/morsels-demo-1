The open end of the sealed part and one of the ends  of the other part are now held in opposite sides of the flame, inclined  at a slight angle to one another as indicated in Fig. 5, and rotated and  heated until the surfaces of both ends are just softened. The two ends  are then carefully and quickly brought together (_a_, Fig. 6), removed  from the flame and pulled apart a little, to reduce the lump formed at  the joint as much as possible, as indicated in _b_. The joint is then  tested by blowing into the open end of the tube to see if it is tight.  If so, the flame is reduced to half or less than half of its former  size, and the joint heated in it, holding the tube and continually  rotating it as directed in the last chapter (page 13).    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Softening ends of two pieces of tubing.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Joining two pieces of tubing end to end--first  method.]    As the tube softens and tends to shrink, the two ends are pressed  together a little and the walls allowed to thicken slightly, as in _c_.  It is then quickly removed from the flame and gently blown as indicated  in _d_, continuing the rotation of the tube during the blowing, and at  the same time pressing the ends of the tube together a little so as to  make a _short_ thick-walled bulb. The joint is then returned to the  flame and reheated, rotating as before, shrinking to about the shape of  _e_. When this stage is reached, the glass should be very hot and fluid,  and the mass of hot glass thick enough to remain at its working  temperature for about five seconds after removal from the flame. The  glass is now reblown as indicated in _f_, to form a bulb having walls of  practically the same thickness as the original tube. As soon as the bulb  is blown, the tube is removed from the mouth, held horizontally in front  of the worker, and gently drawn out to form one continuous tube, as  indicated in _g_. During both the blowing and drawing of this bulb the  rotation must be continued, and both blowing and drawing must be  carefully regulated so that the resulting tube may have the same  internal and external diameter at the joint as elsewhere.    =Discussion.=--In making the original joint, (_a_, Fig. 6), care should  be taken that the lump formed is as small as possible so that it may be  entirely removed during the subsequent operations. For this reason, only  the very tip ends of the two pieces of tubing are held in the flame, and  the softening should not extend more than 1/16 inch down the tube. As  soon as the ends are sufficiently soft to stick together, they are made  to do so. The first drawing of the tube (_b_) should take place  immediately, and reduce the lump as much as possible without making the  adjacent walls of the tube thin. The whole purpose of the rest of the  manipulation is to absorb or \"iron out\" the lump at the joint. For this  reason, care is taken that this lump is always in the center of the  flame while the joint is being heated, and a small flame is used so  that little of the main tube may be softened. During the first shrinking  of the joint (_c_) the walls next the lump, being thinner than it is,  reach the softening temperature first and are thickened by the slight  pushing together of the ends, so that they taper from the lump to the  unchanged wall. Upon blowing this joint, these thickened walls blow out  with the lump, but as they are thinnest next the unchanged tube, they  stiffen there first. Then as the thicker parts are still hot, these blow  out more, and with the lump make a more or less uniform wall. By this  first operation most of the lump will have been removed, provided it was  not too large at first, and the tube was hot enough when it was blown.  Beginners almost invariably have the glass too cool here, and find  difficulty in blowing out a satisfactory bulb. Under such circumstances  the lump will be scarcely affected by the operation.    During the shrinking of this bulb, the thinner parts of course are the  first to reach the softening point, and thus contract more than the  thick parts, so that practically all of the lump can be absorbed, and a  uniformly thickened part of the tube left as in _e_. When this is just  accomplished, the second bulb must be blown during one or two seconds,  and the tube then drawn out as described, so as to change the bulb to a  tube. The drawing must proceed with care: portions nearest the unchanged  tubes are the first to reach the proper diameter, and must be given time  to just set at that point before the center of the bulb is finally drawn  into shape. The drawing is perhaps best done intermittently in a series  of quick pulls, each drawing the tube perhaps 1/16 inch, and each taking  place as the thumbs and first fingers grasp the tube for a new turn in  the rotation. If the tube is not rotated during the blowing, the bulbs  will be lop-sided and it will be impossible to get a joint of uniform  wall-thickness; if rotation is omitted during the drawing, the tube  will almost invariably be quite crooked.    If the lump still shows distinctly after the operations described, the  cross-section of the tube will be as in _h_, and the tube will be likely  to break if ever reheated at this point after it becomes cold. The  operations _d_, _e_, _f_, and _g_ may be repeated upon it, and it may be  possible to get it to come out all right.    Care must be taken not to blow the bulbs _d_ and _f_ too thin as they  then become very difficult to handle, and the joint is usually spoiled.  The wall-thickness of these bulbs must never be much less than that of  the original tube. If the joint as completed has thinner walls than the  rest of the tube, it will be more easily broken. It should be remembered  that the length of the finished tube must be exactly the same as that of  the original piece, if the walls of the joint are to be of their  original thickness. Therefore the pushing together during the two  operations _c_ and _d_ must shorten the tube just as much as the final  drawing (_f_ to _g_) lengthens it.    The interval between the removal of the work from the flame and the  beginning of the blowing must be made as short as possible, or else the  portions next the main parts of the tube will set before they can be  blown out, and cause irregular shrunken areas.      EXERCISE NO. 2    JOINING TWO TUBES END TO END--SECOND METHOD    The method described in Exercise No. 1 is very satisfactory for joining  short lengths of straight tubing, but becomes inconvenient or impossible  when the pieces are long or bent, on account of the difficulty in  uniformly rotating such work. In such cases, this second method is  used. It does not usually give as smooth and pretty a joint as the first  method, and takes a little longer.    The joint is begun exactly as in the first method, and the manipulation  is the same until after the preliminary tight joint (_b_, Fig. 6) is  made. The flame is reduced as usual, but instead of rotating the tube in  the flame, only one part of the circumference is heated, and this is  allowed to shrink thoroughly before blowing. It is then blown gently so  that it becomes a slight swelling on the tube, and the operation  repeated on an adjoining part of the joint. Three or four repetitions of  the operation will usually cover the whole circumference of the joint,  in a small tube, the result being a swelling roughly similar to the  first thick bulb in the first method (_d_, Fig. 6). If all the lumps of  the original joint have not been removed by this operation, it may now  be repeated upon such parts as may require it. The thickness of the wall  in the bulb should be about the same as that in the original tube. The  whole of the expanded joint is now heated as uniformly as may be until  soft enough so that it begins to shrink a little, and the swelling is  gently drawn down to the same diameter as the main tube, as in the first  case. Any irregularities in the finished joint may be corrected by local  reheating, shrinking or blowing as required.    =Discussion.=--In using this method, especially with larger sizes of  tubing, it is very important to keep the whole circumference of the  joint hot enough during the operation so that it does not crack apart at  the part which has not yet been worked. For that reason the first  heating, shrinking and blowing should be performed as quickly as  possible, leaving the resulting irregularities to be corrected later,  rather than attempting to reblow the same part of the joint several  times in succession until it is satisfactory. Care must be taken in this  as in the first method that the blowing follows immediately upon the  completion of the shrinking and removal of the object from the flame:  delay in blowing will cause shrunken places where the joint meets the  original tubes, on account of the cooling and setting of the glass  before it was blown. Most beginners err in being afraid to shrink the  part of the joint enough before blowing it. On small tubing, the  shrinkage may often extend so far that the inner surface of the shrunken  part reaches the center of the tube. Insufficient shrinking results in  failure to remove the lump formed at the original joint. It is often of  advantage, after blowing out part of the joint, to allow that part a few  seconds to set before going on with the rest, keeping the whole joint  warm meanwhile in or near the smoky flame. This helps to prevent the  twisting of the joint, or other distortion incident to the handling of a  piece of work of awkward shape.    In making a joint on a very long or heavy piece by this method, it is  often advantageous to attach a piece of rubber tubing to the open end,  hold the other end of this tubing in the mouth during the process, and  blow through it, rather than attempt to bring the end of the glass up to  the mouth. This enables one to keep closer watch on the joint,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3008"],[0,"The Jargon File, Version 4.2.2, 20 Aug 2000 (#4)"],[1,"mo.com> to     the File and Dictionary; they have read and reread many drafts,     checked facts, caught typos, submitted an amazing number of thoughtful     comments, and done yeoman service in catching typos and minor usage     bobbles.

These include verb     doubling, soundalike slang, the `-P' convention, overgeneralization,     spoken inarticulations, and anthropomorphization. Each is discussed     below. We also cover the standard comparatives for design quality.       Of these six, verb doubling, overgeneralization, anthropomorphization,     and (especially) spoken inarticulations have become quite general; but     soundalike slang is still largely confined to MIT and other large     universities, and the `-P' convention is found only where LISPers     flourish.       * [71]Verb Doubling: Doubling a verb may change its semantics       * [72]Soundalike Slang: Punning jargon       * [73]The -P convention: A LISPy way to form questions       * [74]Overgeneralization: Standard abuses of grammar       * [75]Spoken Inarticulations: Sighing and <*sigh*>ing       * [76]Anthropomorphization: Homunculi, daemons, and confused         programs       * [77]Comparatives: Standard comparatives for design quality       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Verb Doubling, Next:[78]Soundalike Slang, Up:[79]Jargon     Construction      Verb Doubling       A standard construction in English is to double a verb and use it as     an exclamation, such as \"Bang, bang!\" or \"Quack, quack!\". Most of     these are names for noises. Hackers also double verbs as a concise,     sometimes sarcastic comment on what the implied subject does. Also, a     doubled verb is often used to terminate a conversation, in the process     remarking on the current state of affairs or what the speaker intends     to do next. Typical examples involve [80]win, [81]lose, [82]hack,     [83]flame, [84]barf, [85]chomp:         \"The disk heads just crashed.\" \"Lose, lose.\"       \"Mostly he talked about his latest crock. Flame, flame.\"       \"Boy, what a bagbiter! Chomp, chomp!\"       Some verb-doubled constructions have special meanings not immediately     obvious from the verb. These have their own listings in the lexicon.       The [86]Usenet culture has one tripling convention unrelated to this;     the names of `joke' topic groups often have a tripled last element.     The first and paradigmatic example was alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork     (a \"Muppet Show\" reference); other infamous examples have included:         alt.french.captain.borg.borg.borg       alt.wesley.crusher.die.die.die       comp.unix.internals.system.calls.brk.brk.brk       sci.physics.edward.teller.boom.boom.boom       alt.sadistic.dentists.drill.drill.drill       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Soundalike Slang, Next:[87]The -P convention, Previous:[88]Verb     Doubling, Up:[89]Jargon Construction      Soundalike slang       Hackers will often make rhymes or puns in order to convert an ordinary     word or phrase into something more interesting. It is considered     particularly [90]flavorful if the phrase is bent so as to include some     other jargon word; thus the computer hobbyist magazine \"Dr. Dobb's     Journal\" is almost always referred to among hackers as `Dr. Frob's     Journal' or simply `Dr. Frob's'. Terms of this kind that have been in     fairly wide use include names for newspapers:      Boston Herald => Horrid (or Harried)      Boston Globe => Boston Glob      Houston (or San Francisco) Chronicle             => the Crocknicle (or the Comical)      New York Times => New York Slime      Wall Street Journal => Wall Street Urinal       However, terms like these are often made up on the spur of the moment.     Standard examples include:      Data General => Dirty Genitals      IBM 360 => IBM Three-Sickly      Government Property --- Do Not Duplicate (on keys)              => Government Duplicity --- Do Not Propagate      for historical reasons => for hysterical raisins      Margaret Jacks Hall (the CS building at Stanford)              => Marginal Hacks Hall      Microsoft => Microsloth      Internet Explorer => Internet Exploiter       This is not really similar to the Cockney rhyming slang it has been     compared to in the past, because Cockney substitutions are opaque     whereas hacker punning jargon is intentionally transparent.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:The -P convention, Next:[91]Overgeneralization,     Previous:[92]Soundalike Slang, Up:[93]Jargon Construction      The `-P' convention       Turning a word into a question by appending the syllable `P'; from the     LISP convention of appending the letter `P' to denote a predicate (a     boolean-valued function). The question should expect a yes/no answer,     though it needn't. (See [94]T and [95]NIL.)      At dinnertime:              Q: ``Foodp?''

Thus (to     cite one of the best-known examples) Unix hackers often [100]grep for     things rather than searching for them. Many of the lexicon entries are     generalizations of exactly this kind.       Hackers enjoy overgeneralization on the grammatical level as well.     Many hackers love to take various words and add the wrong endings to     them to make nouns and verbs, often by extending a standard rule to     nonuniform cases (or vice versa). For example, because         porous => porosity       generous => generosity       hackers happily generalize:         mysterious => mysteriosity       ferrous => ferrosity       obvious => obviosity       dubious => dubiosity       Another class of common construction uses the suffix `-itude' to     abstract a quality from just about any adjective or noun. This usage     arises especially in cases where mainstream English would perform the     same abstraction through `-iness' or `-ingness'. Thus:         win => winnitude (a common exclamation)       loss => lossitude       cruft => cruftitude       lame => lameitude       Some hackers cheerfully reverse this transformation; they argue, for     example, that the horizontal degree lines on a globe ought to be     called `lats' -- after all, they're measuring latitude!       Also, note that all nouns can be verbed. E.g.: \"All nouns can be     verbed\", \"I'll mouse it up\", \"Hang on while I clipboard it over\", \"I'm     grepping the files\". English as a whole is already heading in this     direction (towards pure-positional grammar like Chinese); hackers are     simply a bit ahead of the curve.       The suffix \"-full\" can also be applied in generalized and fanciful     ways, as in \"As soon as you have more than one cachefull of data, the     system starts thrashing,\" or \"As soon as I have more than one headfull     of ideas, I start writing it all down.\" A common use is \"screenfull\",     meaning the amount of text that will fit on one screen, usually in     text mode where you have no choice as to character size. Another     common form is \"bufferfull\".       However, hackers avoid the unimaginative verb-making techniques     characteristic of marketroids, bean-counters, and the Pentagon; a     hacker would never, for example, `productize', `prioritize', or     `securitize' things. Hackers have a strong aversion to bureaucratic     bafflegab and regard those who use it with contempt.       Similarly, all verbs can be nouned. This is only a slight     overgeneralization in modern English; in hackish, however, it is good     form to mark them in some standard nonstandard way. Thus:         win => winnitude, winnage       disgust => disgustitude       hack => hackification       Further, note the prevalence of certain"]]]
