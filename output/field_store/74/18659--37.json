Acronyms      An acronym is an abbreviation coined from the initial letter of each  successive word in a term or phrase. In general, an acronym made up  solely from the first letter of the major words in the expanded form  is rendered in all capital letters (NATO from North Atlantic Treaty  Organization; an exception would be ASEAN for Association of  Southeast Asian Nations). In general, an acronym made up of more  than the first letter of the major words in the expanded form is  rendered with only an initial capital letter (Comsat from  Communications Satellite Corporation; an exception would be NAM from  Nonaligned Movement). Hybrid forms are sometimes used to distinguish  between initially identical terms (ICC for International Chamber of  Commerce and ICCt for International Criminal Court).        Administrative divisions      This entry generally gives the numbers, designatory terms, and  first-order administrative divisions as approved by the US Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet  acted on by the BGN are noted.        Age structure      This entry provides the distribution of the population according to  age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14 years, 15-64  years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a population affects  a nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with young  populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in  schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage  ages 65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age  structure can also be used to help predict potential political  issues. For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population  unable to find employment can lead to unrest.        Agriculture - products      This entry is an ordered listing of major crops and products  starting with the most important.        Airports      This entry gives the total number of airports or airfields  recognizable from the air. The runway(s) may be paved (concrete or  asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, earth, sand, or gravel  surfaces) and may include closed or abandoned installations.  Airports or airfields that are no longer recognizable (overgrown, no  facilities, etc.) are not included. Note that not all airports have  accommodations for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.        Airports - with paved runways      This entry gives the total number of airports with paved runways  (concrete or asphalt surfaces) by length. For airports with more  than one runway, only the longest runway is included according to  the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m (over 10,000 ft), (2)  2,438 to 3,047 m (8,000 to 10,000 ft), (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m (5,000  to 8,000 ft), (4) 914 to 1,523 m (3,000 to 5,000 ft), and (5) under  914 m (under 3,000 ft). Only airports with usable runways are  included in this listing. Not all airports have facilities for  refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control. The type aircraft  capable of operating from a runway of a given length is dependent  upon a number of factors including elevation of the runway, runway  gradient, average maximum daily temperature at the airport, engine  types, flap settings, and take-off weight of the aircraft.

They make  excellent laboratory stands for elementary courses in microscopy.    In =Stands IV and V= the coarse adjustment is by means of sliding tube.  They are all provided with fine adjustment by micrometer screw.    =Stand VI= is provided with rack and pinion adjustment only. It has a  large stage, and is particularly intended for searching for trichinae  and for similar examinations where a very strong durable stand is  desired and where the use of high power objectives is unnecessary. It  may also be useful as an auxiliary stand for purposes of demonstration  in laboratories.    =Stands III, IV, V, VI= have no joint for inclining the body.    =Stands A, I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, III, IV= have mahogany cases (provided  with a nickelled handle), in which the microscopes stand.    =Stands V and VI= are laid in mahogany boxes.    These cases are furnished with the microscopes without extra charge,  when a =complete outfit=, including oculars and objectives is purchased.    Object clamps and test objects accompany every microscope.    The objectives to Stands A, I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb are in brass boxes;  those for Stands III, IV, V and VI are in morocco cases.            =Illuminating Apparatus.=        =a. Illuminating Apparatus of Stands A and I.=    The apparatus includes the following parts:        Cylinder iris diaphragm.      Swing-out condenser.      Diaphragm carrier with iris diaphragm.      Plane and concave mirror.    The cylinder iris diaphragm comes into play when the condenser  is swung out of position. To do this the diaphragm carrier is  turned to the side as shown in the diagram, a small knob is  pressed, which liberates the condenser, and the latter is  swung out to the side.    The regulation of the cylinder iris diaphragm is accomplished  by means of a lever. Before the condenser is swung back into  position the cylinder iris should be opened to its fullest  extent. The lower iris diaphragm is for use in connection with  the condenser only. It is regulated by means of a small knob.  A horizontal rack and pinion arrangement permits oblique  illumination, and a vertical rack and pinion permits  adjustment of the whole sub-stage. By these means a most  perfect control of the illumination of the object is assured.  Ground or colored glass discs may be inserted above the iris  diaphragm if modification of the light is desired.             =$30.--=    _This illuminating apparatus may also be fitted to Stands Ia and Ib._    [Illustration: Abbe's Illuminating Apparatus for Stand A and I.

[Illustration]    The following are the parts of this apparatus:        Cylinder diaphragm with 3 stops of different apertures.      Condenser.      Diaphragm carrier with iris diaphragm.      Plane and concave mirror.    To substitute the condenser for the cylinder diaphragm the  diaphragm carrier is turned to the side and the cylinder  diaphragm is drawn out of the sleeve which holds it in  position and into which the condenser readily fits. The  diaphragm carrier is then turned back into position and the  amount of light regulated by manipulating the knob controlling  the size of the iris. The whole sub-stage may be raised or  lowered in the optical axis by means of a rack and pinion, and  a similar arrangement permits lateral illumination by moving  the iris diaphragm in the horizontal plane.    Ground glass and colored plates may be inserted above the iris  diaphragm.                                                     =$24.--=        =c. Illuminating Apparatus for Stand II and IIa= (p. 36 & 38).    The condenser and iris diaphragm form one piece, giving  central but no oblique illumination. The whole apparatus may  be raised and lowered in the optical axis by means of a screw.  The cylinder diaphragm may be inserted in place of the  condenser. A ring below the iris diaphragm permits the  insertion of glass discs for the purpose of modifying the  light.                                                         =$12.--=        =d.

We are glad to supply any other combination of eye-pieces and objectives  which may be preferred. The price of each outfit may be readily computed  by adding together the cost of its various items.    Microscope =stands=, without objectives, will not be sold separately.    [Illustration: Stand A.--Universal Microscope.]        =Stand \"A\".=      Universal Microscope.    In the construction of our new stand \"A\" we have taken special care to  enlarge all the parts proportionately in order to secure strength and  stability, at the same time adding to the beauty of the instrument.    The upper pillar of the microscope is shaped in such a way as to form a  convenient handle; and to increase the free working space over the  stage, thereby allowing the examination of very large specimen and  culture plates. A specially constructed mechanical stage larger than No.  98 may be attached, which is adapted for slides up to 2x4 inches (50x100  mm).    The extra large dimensions of all the main parts of this microscope such  as the base and stage etc., allow that freedom of movement so desired in  a stand for photo-micrography.    Both the body tube and graduated draw tube are very wide and permit the  use of low power objectives to cover specimen of large extent; for the  same reason the opening in the stage is very wide but can be narrowed  down by a stop.    The most important innovation on the microscope is the new fine  adjustment device, which is unexcelled both in solidity of construction  and accuracy of movement, representing the highest attainment of the  designers and mechanics skill.    Sectional cuts of this unique arrangement are shown in illustration (p.  26-27).    All that can be seen on the exterior are two small milled heads mounted  below and somewhat back of the two larger knobs controlling the rack and  pinion (coarse) adjustment of the microscope. The knob on the right side  is provided with a graduated drum _r_, indicating the movement of the  fine adjustment.    The two knobs with drum are mounted on an axle _a_, which in its central  portion is enlarged and provided with a worm gear. The latter in its  turn drives the gear wheel, _d_. A spiral spring pressing against one of  the journals into which the axle is mounted prevents any lost motion in  the worm gear. Mounted on the same shaft with the gear-wheel _d_, is a  heartshaped cam _f_. On this cam rests the steel roller _g_, fitted on  the support _k_, which in its turn carries the microscope tube. By its  weight and a spiral spring the latter presses on the cam _f_, and  effects a direct vertical movement.    [Illustration]    The periphery of the heart shaped cam _f_, is exactly symmetrical and  mathematically correct. The distance traversed by its curved sides from  the lowest to the highest point and vice versa is 3 mm. There are cut 60  teeth in the entire periphery of the gear-wheel _d_; the number  corresponding to one side of the heart-shaped cam or 3 mm elevation, are  30 teeth, therefore 1 tooth means a movement of 3/30 mm or 0,1 mm.    This in turn requires one complete revolution of the axle _a_, the drum  of which is graduated into 100 parts. The value of each division on the  drum is therefore 0,1/100=0,001 mm.    This micrometer fine adjustment is exceedingly accurate and reliable,  and besides it has the following advantages;    By virtue of its unique construction the movement is continuous, there  is absolutely no limit to the motion of the micrometer screw, which may  be turned forward or backward as the work requires.    This movement extends in exact ratio to the revolution of the cam for a  distance of 3 mm. As another advantage we may mention, that it is almost  impossible to break the coverglass of the specimen with this fine  adjustment.    Should the objective come in contact with the coverglass and assuming  the knob is turned still further then the tube, which is of aluminium  and very light would simply rest on the specimen, without breaking the  coverglass, as the latter will easily stand the small pressure of the  tube and the fine spiral spring.    [Illustration]    No.                                                                $       1.
