An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#4)"],[1," upright intentions and zeal for  the public welfare cannot justify rash solutions.\"      Was it policy, we mean prudence, which induced Proudhon to screen his  ideas of equality behind the Mosaic law? Sainte Beuve, like many others,  seems to think so. But we remember perfectly well that, having asked  Proudhon, in August, 1848, if he did not consider himself indebted in  some respects to his fellow-countryman, Charles Fourier, we received  from him the following reply: \"I have certainly read Fourier, and have  spoken of him more than once in my works; but, upon the whole, I do not  think that I owe anything to him. My real masters, those who have caused  fertile ideas to spring up in my mind, are three in number: first, the  Bible; next, Adam Smith; and last, Hegel.\"    Freely confessed in the \"Celebration of Sunday,\" the influence of the  Bible on Proudhon is no less manifest in his first memoir on property.  Proudhon undoubtedly brought to this work many ideas of his own; but  is not the very foundation of ancient Jewish law to be found in its  condemnation of usurious interest and its denial of the right of  personal appropriation of land?    The first memoir on property appeared in 1840, under the title, \"What is  Property? or an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government.\"  Proudhon dedicated it, in a letter which served as the preface, to the  Academy of Besancon. The latter, finding itself brought to trial by its  pensioner, took the affair to heart, and evoked it, says Sainte Beuve,  with all possible haste.    The pension narrowly escaped being immediately withdrawn from the bold  defender of the principle of equality of conditions. M. Vivien, then  Minister of Justice, who was earnestly solicited to prosecute the  author, wished first to obtain the opinion of the economist, Blanqui, a  member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. Proudhon having  presented to this academy a copy of his book, M. Blanqui was appointed  to review it. This review, though it opposed Proudhon's views, shielded  him. Treated as a savant by M. Blanqui, the author was not prosecuted.  He was always grateful to MM. Blanqui and Vivien for their handsome  conduct in the matter.    M. Blanqui's review, which was partially reproduced by \"Le Moniteur,\" on  the 7th of September, 1840, naturally led Proudhon to address to him, in  the form of a letter, his second memoir on property, which appeared  in April, 1841. Proudhon had endeavored, in his first memoir, to  demonstrate that the pursuit of equality of conditions is the true  principle of right and of government. In the \"Letter to M. Blanqui,\" he  passes in review the numerous and varied methods by which this principle  gradually becomes realized in all societies, especially in modern  society.    In 1842, a third memoir appeared, entitled, \"A Notice to Proprietors, or  a Letter to M. Victor Considerant, Editor of 'La Phalange,' in Reply  to a Defence of Property.\" Here the influence of Adam Smith manifested  itself, and was frankly admitted. Did not Adam Smith find, in the  principle of equality, the first of all the laws which govern wages?  There are other laws, undoubtedly; but Proudhon considers them all as  springing from the principle of property, as he defined it in his first  memoir. Thus, in humanity, there are two principles,--one which leads us  to equality, another which separates us from it. By the former, we  treat each other as associates; by the latter, as strangers, not to say  enemies. This distinction, which is constantly met with throughout the  three memoirs, contained already, in germ, the idea which gave birth to  the \"System of Economical Contradictions,\" which appeared in 1846, the  idea of antinomy or contre-loi.    The \"Notice to Proprietors\" was seized by the magistrates of Besancon;  and Proudhon was summoned to appear before the assizes of Doubs within  a week. He read his written defence to the jurors in person, and was  acquitted. The jury, like M. Blanqui, viewed him only as a philosopher,  an inquirer, a savant.    In 1843, Proudhon published the \"Creation of Order in Humanity,\" a  large volume, which does not deal exclusively with questions of social  economy. Religion, philosophy, method, certainty, logic, and dialectics  are treated at considerable length.    Released from his printing-office on the 1st of March of the same year,  Proudhon had to look for a chance to earn his living. Messrs. Gauthier  Bros., carriers by water between Mulhouse and Lyons, the eldest of whom  was Proudhon's companion in childhood, conceived the happy thought  of employing him, of utilizing his ability in their business, and in  settling the numerous points of difficulty which daily arose. Besides  the large number of accounts which his new duties required him to make  out, and which retarded the publication of the \"System of Economical  Contradictions,\" until October, 1846, we ought to mention a work, which,  before it appeared in pamphlet form, was published in the \"Revue des  Economistes,\"--\"Competition between Railroads and Navigable Ways.\"    \"Le Miserere, or the Repentance of a King,\" which he published in  March, 1845, in the \"Revue Independante,\" during that Lenten season when  Lacordaire was preaching in Lyons, proves that, though devoting himself  with ardor to the study of economical problems, Proudhon had not lost  his interest in questions of religious history. Among his writings on  these questions, which he was unfortunately obliged to leave unfinished,  we may mention a nearly completed history of the early Christian  heresies, and of the struggle of Christianity against Caesarism.    We have said that, in 1848, Proudhon recognized three masters. Having  no knowledge of the German language, he could not have read the works  of Hegel, which at that time had not been translated into French. It  was Charles Grun, a German, who had come to France to study the various  philosophical and socialistic systems, who gave him the substance of the  Hegelian ideas. During the winter of 1844-45, Charles Grun had some long  conversations with Proudhon, which determined, very decisively, not the  ideas, which belonged exclusively to the bisontin thinker, but the form  of the important work on which he labored after 1843, and which was  published in 1846 by Guillaumin.    Hegel's great idea, which Proudhon appropriated, and which he  demonstrates with wonderful ability in the \"System of Economical  Contradictions,\" is as follows: Antinomy, that is, the existence of two  laws or tendencies which are opposed to each other, is possible,  not only with two different things, but with one and the same thing.  Considered in their thesis, that is, in the law or tendency which  created them, all the economical categories are rational,--competition,  monopoly, the balance of trade, and property, as well as the division  of labor, machinery, taxation, and credit. But, like communism and  population, all these categories are antinomical; all are opposed, not  only to each other, but to themselves. All is opposition, and disorder  is born of this system of opposition. Hence, the sub-title of the  work,--\"Philosophy of Misery.\" No category can be suppressed; the  opposition, antinomy, or contre-tendance, which exists in each of them,  cannot be suppressed.    Where, then, lies the solution of the social problem? Influenced by the  Hegelian ideas, Proudhon began to look for it in a superior synthesis,  which should reconcile the thesis and antithesis. Afterwards, while at  work upon his book on \"Justice,\" he saw that the antinomical terms do  not cancel each other, any more than the opposite poles of an electric  pile destroy each other; that they are the procreative cause of motion,  life, and progress; that the problem is to discover, not their fusion,  which would be death, but their equilibrium,--an equilibrium for ever  unstable, varying with the development of society.    On the cover of the \"System of Economical Contradictions,\" Proudhon  announced, as soon to appear, his \"Solution of the Social Problem.\" This  work, upon which he was engaged when the Revolution of 1848 broke  out, had to be cut up into pamphlets and newspaper articles. The two  pamphlets, which he published in March, 1848, before he became editor  of \"Le Representant du Peuple,\" bear the same title,--\"Solution of the  Social Problem.\" The first, which is mainly a criticism of the early  acts of the provisional government, is notable from the fact that in  it Proudhon, in advance of all others, energetically opposed the  establishment of national workshops. The second, \"Organization of  Credit and Circulation,\" sums up in a few pages his idea of economical  progress: a gradual reduction of interest, profit, rent, taxes, and  wages. All progress hitherto has been made in this manner; in this  manner it must continue to be made. Those workingmen who favor a nominal  increase of wages are, unconsciously following a back-track, opposed to  all their interests.    After having published in \"Le Representant du Peuple,\" the statutes of  the Bank of Exchange,--a bank which was to make no profits, since it  was to have no stockholders, and which, consequently, was to discount  commercial paper with out interest, charging only a commission  sufficient to defray its running expenses,--Proudhon endeavored, in  a number of articles, to explain its mechanism and necessity. These  articles have been collected in one volume, under the double title,  \"Resume of the Social Question; Bank of Exchange.\" His other articles,  those which up to December, 1848, were inspired by the progress of  events, have been collected in another volume,--\"Revolutionary Ideas.\"    Almost unknown in March, 1848, and struck off in April from the list of  candidates for the Constituent Assembly by the delegation of workingmen  which sat at the Luxembourg, Proudhon had but a very small number of  votes at the general"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36020"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#4)"],[1,"me so I lets out a whoop for help.

Far down the road a  ramshackle buckboard disappeared over a slight hill; directly in front  the path ran at twenty yards into the dilapidated steps of a Negro  cabin, while an old colored man in a vegetable garden to the left to the  cabin broke the stillness with the intermittent metallic sounds of his  spade digging into thirsty soil.
