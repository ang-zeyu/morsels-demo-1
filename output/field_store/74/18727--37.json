The Kaw or the Kansas River, the valley of which we were traversing, is  the principal stream of the State--in length to the mouth of the  Republican one hundred and fifty miles, and above that, under the name  of Smoky Hill, three hundred miles more.    The \"Smoky Hill trail\" is a familiar name in many an American home. It  was the great California path, and many a time the demons of the plain  gloated over fair hair, yet fresh from a mother's touch and blessing.  And many a faint and thirsty traveler has flung himself with a burst of  gratitude on the sandy bed of the desolate river, and thanked the Great  Giver of all good for the concealed life found under the sand, and with  the strength thus sucked from the bosom of our much-abused mother, he  has pushed onward until at length the grand mountains and great parks of  Colorado burst upon his delighted vision.    About noon we arrived at Topeka, the capital, well situated on the south  bank of the river, having a comfortable, well-to-do air, which suggests  the quiet satisfaction of an honest burgher after a morning of toil. The  slavery billow of agitation rolled even thus far from beyond the border  of the state. Armed men rode over the beautiful prairies, some east,  some west--one band to transplant slavery from the tainted soil of  Missouri, another to pluck it up.    A small party of Free State men settled upon this beautiful prairie.  South flowed the Waukarusa, south and east the Shunganunga, and west and  north the Kaw or Kansas. Here thrived a bulbous root, much loved by the  red man, and here lazy Pottawatomies gathered in the fall to dig it. In  size and somewhat in shape, it resembled a goose egg, and had a hard,  reddish brown shell, and an interior like damaged dough. The Indian  gourmands ate it greedily and called it \"Topeka.\" From the two or three  families of refugee Free State men the town grew up, and from the Indian  root it took its name. Its christening took place in the first cabin  erected, and it is reported that a now prominent banker of the town  stood sponsor, with his back against the door, refusing any egress until  the name of his choice was accepted. It is even affirmed that one  opposing city founder was pulled back by his coat-tail from an attempted  escape up the wide chimney.    [Illustration: \"WAUKARUSA.\"]    [Illustration: \"TOASTS HIS MOCCASINED FEET BY THE FIRE.\"]    The old Indian love of commemorating events by significant names is well  illustrated in Kansas. One example may be given here. Waukarusa once  opposed its swollen tide to an exploring band of red men. Now, from time  beyond ken, the noble savage has been illustrious for the ingenuity with  which he lays all disagreeable duties upon the shoulders of the patient  squaw. He may ride to their death, in free wild sport, the bison  multitudes; but their skins must be converted into marketable robes,  and the flesh into jerked meat, by the ugly and over-worked partner of  his bosom. While she pins the raw hide to earth, and bends patiently  over, fleshing it with horn hatchet for weary hours, the stronger  vessel, his abdominal recesses wadded with buffalo meat, toasts his  moccasined feet by the fire, fills his lungs with smoke from villainous  killikinick, and muses soothingly of white scalps and happy hunting  grounds.    Ox-like maiden, happy \"big injun!\" you both belong to an age and a  history well nigh past, and let us rejoice that it is so.    But to return to the band long since gathered into aboriginal dust whom  we left pausing on the banks of the Waukarusa. \"Deep water, bad bottom!\"  grunted the braves, and, nothing doubting it, one loving warrior pushed  his wife and her pony over the bank to test the matter. From the middle  of the tide the squaw called back, \"Waukarusa\" (thigh deep), and soon  had gained the opposite bank in safety. Then and there the creek  received its name, \"Waukarusa.\"    We procured a remarkable sketch, in the well known Indian style of high  art, commemorative of this event. It has always struck us that the  savage order of drawing resembles very much that of the ancient  Egyptian--except in the matter of drawing at sight, with bow or rifle,  on the white man.

When permission was given me to draw upon the journal of our trip for  such material as I might desire, it was stipulated that the camp-names  should be adhered to. A company on the plains is no respecter of  persons, and titles which might have caused offense before starting were  received in good part, and worn gracefully thenceforward.    Our leader, Professor Paleozoic, ordinarily existed in a sort of  transition state between the primary and tertiary formations. He could  tell cheese from chalk under the microscope, and show that one was full  of the fossil and the other of the living evidences of animal life. A  worthy man, vastly more troubled with rocks on the brain than \"rocks\" in  the pocket.    Learning had once come near making him mad, but from this sad fate he  was happily saved by a somewhat Pickwickian blunder. While in Kansas,  some years since, he penetrated a remote portion of the wilderness,  where, as he was happy in believing, none but the native savage, or,  possibly, the primeval man, could ever have tarried long enough to leave  any sign behind. Imagine his astonishment and delight, therefore, when  from the tangled grass he drew an upright stone, with lines chiseled on  three sides and on the fourth a rude figure resembling more than any  thing else one of those odd fictions which geologists call restored  specimens. On a ledge near were huge depressions like foot-prints. They  were foot-prints of birds, no doubt, and quite as perfect as those found  in more favored localities, and from which whole skeletons had been  constructed by learned men.    Both specimens were forwarded to, and at the expense of, noted savans of  the East. Our professor called the pillar from the tangled grass an  altar raised by early races to the winds. The short lines, he suggested,  designated the different points of the compass, while the rude figure  was intended for Boreas. Our scientists toward the rising sun met the  boxes at the depot, paid charges, and careful draymen bore them to the  expectant museum.    One hour after, seven wise men might have been seen wending their way  sorrowfully homeward, with hands crossed meditatively under their  coat-tails, and pocket vacuums where lately were modern coins.  Government clearly had a case against our professor. Science decided  that he had removed a stone telling in surveyors' signs just what  section and township it was on. The figure which he had imagined a  heathen idea of Boreas was the fancy of some surveyor's idle moment--a  shocking sketch of an impossible buffalo. Whether the bird-tracks had a  common origin, or were hewn by the hatchets of the red man, is a point  still under discussion.    A worthy man, as before remarked, was the professor, full of knowledge,  genial in camp, and, having rubbed his eye-tooth on a section stone,  geological authority of the highest order. When the professor said a  particular rock belonged to the cretaceous formation, one might safely  conclude that no modern influences had been at work either on that rock  or in that vicinity. That question was settled.    Next came Tammany Sachem, our heavy weight and our mystery. Before  joining our party, he had been a New York alderman, noted for prowess in  annual aldermanic clam-bakes at Coney Island. He was wont to exhibit a  medal, the prize of such a tournament, on which several immense clams  were racing to the griddle, for the honor of being devoured by the city  fathers.    A green-ribbed hunting coat traversed his rotundity, which had the  generous swell of a puncheon. His face was reddish, and his nose like a  beacon-light against a sunset sky. When you thought him awake, he was  half asleep; when you thought him asleep, he was wide awake. A look of  extreme happiness always beamed on his face when misfortunes impended.  Per contra, successes made him suspicious and morose. New York aldermen  have always been a puzzle to the nation at large. Perhaps our friend's  facial contradictions, put on originally as one of the tricks of the  trade, had become chronic from long usage. We have since learned that  the sachems of Tammany laugh the loudest and joke the most freely when  under affliction.    [Illustration: THE PROFESSOR--A REMARKABLE STONE.]    [Illustration: TAMMANY SACHEM--PROSPECTIVE AND RETROSPECTIVE.]    When I was appointed editor, the Sachem volunteered as local  reporter. Many of the items he gathered are entered in our log-book in  rhyme, and to these pages some of them are transferred verbatim. In  wooing the muses, our alderman certainly acted out of character. The  ideal poet is thin instead of obese, and he is a reckless innovator who  lays claim to any measure of the divine afflatus without possessing  either a pale face, thin form, or a garret.    As to what drove a New York alderman to the society of buffaloes, we had  but one explanation, and that was Sachem's own. We knew that he disliked  women in every form, Sorosis and Anti-Sorosis, bitter and sweet alike.  According to his statement, made to us in good faith, and which I  chronicle in the same, Cupid had once essayed to drive a dart into  Sachem's heart, but, in doing so, the barb also struck and wounded his  liver. As his love increased, his health failed. His liver became  affected in the same ratio as his heart. This was touching our alderman  in a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39685"],[0,"Nooks and Corners of Old England (#4)"],[1,"Lee in _Woodstock_; and in  the manor are preserved many of his manuscripts written during his  twenty years' confinement in the Tower. In the great hall there is a  blocked-up entrance to a subterranean passage running towards Kirby, and  through this secret despatches are said to have been carried in the time  of the Civil War; and at the back of a fireplace in the same apartment  is a hiding-place sufficiently large to contain a score of people  standing up. One of the rooms is called Henry VII.'s room, as that  monarch when Earl of Richmond is said to have ridden from Bosworth Field  to seek refuge at Deene, then a monastery.    [Illustration: WOTHORPE MANOR-HOUSE.]    Among the numerous portraits are the Earl of Shrewsbury, who was slain  by the second Duke of Buckingham in the notorious duel, and his wife  Lady Anne Brudenel, who was daughter of the second Earl of Cardigan.  Some time before the poor plain little duchess suspected that she had a  formidable rival in the beautiful countess, she was returning from a  visit to Deene to her house near Stamford, where her reckless husband  just then found it convenient to hide himself, as a warrant for high  treason was out against him, when she noticed a suspicious little  cavalcade travelling in the same direction. Ordering the horses to be  whipped up, she arrived in time to give the alarm. The duke had just set  out for Burleigh House with some ladies in his company, and, says  Clarendon, the sergeant \"made so good haste that he was in view of the  coach, and saw the duke alight out of the coach and lead a lady into the  house, upon which the door of the court was shut before he could get to  it. He knocked loudly at that and other doors that were all shut, so  that he could not get into the house though it were some hours before  sunset in the month of May.\"[5] Pepys was strolling in the park and met  Sergeant Bearcroft \"who was sent for the Duke of Buckingham, to have  brought his prisoner to the Tower. He come to towne this day and brings  word that being overtaken and outrid by the Duchesse of Buckingham  within a few miles of the duke's house of Westhorp, he believes she got  thither about a quarter of an hour before him, and so had time to  consider; so that when he came, the doors were kept shut against him.  The next day, coming with officers of the neighbour market-town  [Stamford] to force open the doors, they were open for him, but the duke  gone, so he took horse presently and heard upon the road that the Duke  of Buckingham was gone before him for London. So that he believes he is  this day also come to towne before him; but no newes is yet heard of  him.\"[6] Many blunders have been made in reference to the duke's house  of \"Westhorp.\" Some have called it \"Owthorp\" and others \"Westhorpe\" in  Suffolk, the demolished mansion of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. The  place referred to is really Wothorpe manor-house, the remains of which  stand some two miles to the south of Stamford and ten to the north of  Deene. The existing portion consists of four towers, the lower part of  which is square and the upper octagonal, presumably having been at one  time surmounted by cupolas. The windows are long and narrow, having only  one mullion running parallel across. Beneath the moulding of the summit  of each tower are circular loopholes. It is evidently of Elizabethan  date, but much of the ornamental detail is lost in the heavy mantle of  ivy and the trees which encircle it.    [Illustration: KIRBY HALL.]    That that stately Elizabethan mansion, Kirby Hall (which is close to  Deene), should ever have been allowed to fall to ruin is most  regrettable and deplorable. It was one of John Thorpe's masterpieces,  the architect of palatial Burleigh, of Holland House and Audley End, and  other famous historic houses. He laid the foundation-stone in 1570, and  that other great master Inigo Jones made additions in the reign of  Charles I. The founder of Kirby was Sir Christopher Hatton, who is said  to have first danced into the virgin queen's favour at a masque at  Court. The Earl of Leicester probably first was famous in this way, if  we may judge from the quaint painting at Penshurst, where he is bounding  her several feet into the air; but was not so accomplished as Sir  Christopher, who in his official robes of Lord Chancellor danced in the  Hall of the Inner Temple with the seals and mace of his office before  him, an undignified proceeding, reminding one of the scene in one of the  Gilbert and Sullivan operas.    [Illustration: DOORWAY, KIRBY HALL.]    [Illustration: GATEWAY, KIRBY HALL.]    Kirby must have been magnificent in its day; and when we consider that  it was in occupation by the Chancellor's descendant, the Earl of  Winchelsea, in 1830 or even later, one may judge by seeing it how  rapidly a neglected building can fall into decay. Even in our own memory  a matter of twenty years has played considerable havoc, and cleared off  half the roof. Standing in the deserted weed-grown courtyard, one cannot  but grieve to see the widespread destruction of such beautiful  workmanship. The graceful fluted Ionic pilasters that intersect the  lofty mullioned windows are falling to pieces bit by bit, and the  fantastic stone pinnacles above and on the carved gable ends are  disappearing one by one. But much of the glass is still in the windows,  and some of the rooms are not all yet open to the weather, and the great  hall and music gallery and the \"Library\" with fine bay window are both  in a fair state of preservation. Is it yet too much to hope that pity  may be taken upon what is undoubtedly one of the finest Elizabethan  houses in England? The north part of the Inner Court is represented in  S. E. Waller's pathetic picture \"The Day of Reckoning,\" which has been  engraved.    Some three miles to the south of Kirby is the village of Corby, famous  for its surrounding woods, and a curious custom called the \"Poll Fair,\"  which takes place every twenty years. Should a stranger happen to be  passing through the village when the date falls due, he is liable to be  captured and carried on a pole to the stocks, which ancient instrument  of punishment is there, and put to use on these occasions. He may  purchase his liberty by handing over any coin he happens to have. It  certainly is a rather eccentric way of commemorating the charter granted  by Elizabeth and confirmed by Charles II. by which the residents (all of  whom are subjected to similar treatment) are exempt from market tolls  and jury service.    A pair of stocks stood formerly at the foot of the steps of the graceful  Eleanor Cross at Geddington to the south of Corby. Of the three  remaining memorials said to have been erected by Edward I. at every  place where the coffin of his queen rested on its way from Hardeby in  Lincolnshire to Westminster Abbey, Geddington Cross is by far the most  graceful and in the best condition. The other two are at Waltham and  Northampton. Originally there were fifteen Eleanor crosses, including  Hardeby, Lincoln, Stony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St. Albans,  Cheapside, and Charing Cross. The last two, the most elaborate of all,  as is known, were destroyed by order of Lord Mayor Pennington in 1643  and 1647, accompanied by the blast of trumpets.

SOME SUFFOLK NOOKS      The idea of calling pretty little Mildenhall in north-west Suffolk a  town, seems out of place. It is snug and sleepy and prosperous-looking,  an inviting nook to forget the noise and bustle of a town in the  ordinary sense of the word. May it long continue so, and may the day be  long distant when that terrible invention, the electric tram, is  introduced to spoil the peace and harmony. Mildenhall is one of those  old-world places where one may be pretty sure in entering the snug old  courtyard of its ancient inn, that one will be treated rather as a  friend than a traveller. Facing the \"Bell\" is the church, remarkable for  the unique tracery of its early-English eastern window, and for its  exceptionally fine open hammer-beam carved oak roof, with bold carved  spandrels and large figures of angels with extended wings, and the  badges of Henry V., the swan and antelope, displayed in the south aisle.    In a corner of the little market-square is a curious hexagonal timber  market-cross of this monarch's time, roofed with slabs of lead set  diagonally, and adding to the picturesque effect. The centre part runs  through the roof to a considerable height, and is surmounted by a  weather-cock. Standing beneath the low-pitched roof, one may get a good  idea of the massiveness of construction of these old Gothic structures;  an object-lesson to the jerry builder of to-day. The oaken supports are  relieved with graceful mouldings.    Within bow-shot of the market-cross is the gabled Jacobean manor-house  of the Bunburys, a weather-worn wing of which abuts upon the street. The  family name recalls associations with the beautiful sisters whom  Goldsmith dubbed \"Little Comedy\" and the \"Jessamy Bride.\" The original  \"Sir Joshua\" of these ladies may be seen at Barton Hall, another seat of  the Bunburys a few miles away, where they played good-natured practical  jokes upon their friend the poet. In a room of the Mildenhall mansion  hangs a portrait of a less beautiful woman, but sufficiently attractive  to meet with the approval of a critical connoisseur. When the Merry  Monarch took unto himself a wife, this portrait of the little Portuguese  woman was sent for him to see; and presumably it was flattering, for  when Catherine arrived in person, his Majesty was uncivil enough to  inquire whether they "]]]
