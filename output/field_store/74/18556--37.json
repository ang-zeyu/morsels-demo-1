[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30850"],[0,"Philippine Mats (#4)"],[1,"the simplest and is the one which beginners should  first take up. It is made by weaving over one and under one  continuously. Until this is thoroughly mastered children should not  be allowed to begin the more difficult weaves.    The steps have been diagrammed in figures sufficiently large and  clear in Plates VII, VIII, and IX that a detailed explanation is  not necessary. Step 1 shows the position of the first four straws  as they are placed upon the table or desk; steps 2, 3, 4, and 5,  continued additions and weaving; steps 6, 7, and 8, turning the edge  a on the end of the mat; step 9, turning the opposite edge c; step 10,  the double turn of the corner straw; step 11, the corner turn woven in  the mat at corner No. 1, lapping over the straw already woven; step  12, the continuation of the second edge b; step 13, the turning of  the second and third corners; and steps 14 and 15, finishing the mat.    In weaving large mats, it is customary to begin at one end of the  mat, preferably near the left-hand corner as the mat lies before the  weaver. The weaving continues along the end until half of the desired  width of the mat is reached, when the first corner is turned. Now the  weaving continues down the side and in, as far as the middle of the  mat. When the desired length is woven, the second corner is turned  and the first half of the mat completed.    As the straws are not generally long enough without splicing, new  straws are now added by lapping them from two to three inches upon  the projecting ends of the straws already woven. This makes a narrow  strip of double thickness down the center running the length of the  mat. The weaving now continues as before until the desired width of  the mat is attained, when the third corner is turned. The remainder  is woven and finished at the fourth corner as shown by steps 14 and 15.    Some weavers begin at the sides, and some few, even at the corners;  but this should not be encouraged since it results in making two or  more seams, where the straws lap.    Care must be taken to weave all parts of the mat equally close and  keep the edges perfectly straight; otherwise the mat when finished  will be lop-sided, and consequently of no value. In weaving tapering  grasses like tikug, which have ends of slightly different sizes,  the opposite ends of the straws should be alternated. This prevents  one edge of a mat from building faster than the other.        Sawali Weaves.      Simple Sawali.    By sawali weave is meant all \"woven in\" designs that are not woven  by ones as in the over and under weave. They may be woven regularly  by twos, threes, etc.; or they may \"switch\" the floating straws so  as to form a variety of artistic figure designs. In fact, there is  no limit to the number of designs that may be thus made.    Steps 1 and 2 illustrate the beginning of a sawali weave by twos. First  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are laid down; then c is put under 1-2, over 3-4, and  under 5; d over 1, under 2-3, and over 4-5; e over 1-2, under 3-4,  and over 5. This process is continued, advancing one straw each time  until the desired amount is woven. If the weaving is by threes or  fours, the same principle is followed; that is, the straw goes over  three and under three, advancing one straw each time.        Panels.    Most \"woven in\" mat designs are arranged in panels, with a ground  between, as this gives a more pleasing effect than a continuous figure  weaving. Panels may be woven either length-wise (step 8), crosswise  (step 8), diagonally across the mat (step 4), or in zigzags (step  3). They are most easily woven when arranged diagonally, for then the  colors may be carried from border to border without mixing with the  ground outside of the panel. Checks are made by weaving cross panels  at regular intervals.    In making parallel panels (panels parallel either to the sides or  ends), more than two colors can rarely be used to advantage.    Step 3 illustrates the weaving of a zigzag sawali panel. The straws,  a, b, k, and l are woven by ones. It takes twelve straws one way  and nine the other to make this panel. If a wider panel is desired,  the same weaving is repeated as often as necessary.    The straws a, b, k, and l are woven by ones. Put l over b and c,  under de, over fg, under hi and over j. Put 2 under b, over cd,  under ef, over gh, under ij and over k. Put 3 over b, under c, over  de, under fg, over hi and under jk. Put 4 under bcd, over ef, under  gh and over ijk. Put 5 over bc, under de, over fg, under hi and over  j. Put 6 under b, over cd, under ef, over gh, under ij and over k. Put  7 over b, under c, over de, under fg, over hi, under jk. Put 8 under  b, over cd, under ef, over gh, under ij and over k. Put 9 over bc,  under de, over fg, under hi and over j. Put 10 under bcd, over ef,  under gh and over ijk. Put 11 over b, under c, over de, under fg,  over hi and under jk. Put 12 under b, over cd, under ef, over gh,  under ij and over k. Then the whole operation is again repeated. It  will be seen that the manner of weaving 2 and 12, 3 and 11, 4 and 10,  and 5 and 9 is the same.    Step 4 illustrates the diamond figure design, woven by threes, with  11 straws in width.    Put 1 under cd, over efg, under h, over ijk and under lm. Put 2  under c, over def, under ghi, over jkl and under m. Put 3 over cde,  under fghij and over klm. Put 4 over cd, under efg, over h, under  ijk and over lm. Put 5 over c, under def, over ghi, under jkl and  over m. Put 6 under cde, over fghij and under klm. Now the order  reverses, 7 being the same as 5, 8 as 4, etc., until the other half  of the figure is completed at 11. Now put 12 under cde, over fghij  and under klm. Put 13 over c, under def, over ghi, under jkl and over  m. Put 14 under cde, over fghij and under klm. Now 1 repeats itself,  and the second figure is woven as the first. It is believed that  with the aid of the large illustrations here presented the teacher  or pupil can now follow for himself the other designs given, without  a detailed explanation of each step.        \"Woven-in\" Borders.    Woven-in border designs may be made in three different ways; viz.,  First, by weaving the design around the mat, using the same straws  that run through the body. (See Plate XIII, Fig. 1.) In this case  the color effect is one of confusion, since the dyed straws used in  the designs of the body of the mat have no relation to the design of  the border when they enter it. Second, by weaving the border and the  body of the mat of different straws, uniting them at the inner edge  of the border by a loop as described in the Romblon mat. (See Plate  XVI.) Third, by lapping the colored straws desired in the border,  upon the projecting ends of the straws of the body of the mat. (See  step 8, Plate XII.) These latter two methods are much more artistic,  as a uniform color effect appears throughout the border. (See Plate  XIII, Fig. 2.)        The Romblon Mat.    Making Open Work.    Simple open work is illustrated in Plate XIV.    Weave corner Z, using straws a, b, c, d, e and f, letting f float  at both ends. Weave g, turning upward and over f, then making a  double corner at y, passing under f, to the left and over f, and let  float. Weave h, i, j, k, l and m in solid weave. Turn h under i and  over j. Turn j upward and over i, to the left under f, upward over g,  double corner at W, passing down under g, over g, and floating. Turn m  upward over l to the left, under i, upward over f, to the left under  g, upward over j making a double corner at X, passing under j. The  straws j and m alternately cross each other to corner V.    The other half of this open design is an exact duplicate of this  weaving, and the remaining designs have the same turns as the one  explained, except that in opposite designs the straws are turned in  opposite directions. By following this plate it is easy to finish  the weaves. If one straw is woven over another, it folds down before  passing over, and, vice versa, if it passes under, it folds upward  in turning.    As is seen, the holes are made simply by turning the straws in the  weave. The different shaped holes in other designs (see plates) are  made by turning a different number of straws according to the shape  desired. Varied border edges may be made by switching the straws in  any direction desired.        Introducing Color Panel.    Step 1 of Plate XVI shows the first colored panel, straw ab placed  between cd, the space between x and y having been already woven,  as shown in step 11.    Step 2. Folding a to the right.    Step 3. Folding a under and down.    Step 4. Folding c over a and to left.    Step 5. Folding a over c and upward.    Step 6. Folding b under d to left.    Step 7. Folding b upward, with right twist downward.    Step 8. Folding d downward, with right twist to right.    Step 9. Folding b under d upward.    Step 10. Shows addition of second straw ef woven to the right, where  the same process of turning is gone through as illustrated in steps  6 to 9 inclusive. If weaving is to the left, steps 1 to 5 inclusive  are repeated.    Step 11. Shows continued additions and weaving both to the right  and left.    Step 12. Shows both edges of panel woven, the inside turnings being  the same as those of the outer edge.        Circular Mats.    The circular mat is woven like the crown of a hat, with either the  radiating center or a square center radiating at the four corners. In  either case, the weaver must be careful to add the proper number of  straws so that the mat will be flat, and not cupped or fluted. The  cupping is caused by not adding a sufficient number and the fluting  by adding too many.    In tightening the weaving, do not pull the added straws (Plate XIX,  step 6, straw x-x) or holes will be made at the elbow. Instead, pull  the longer straws that run through the center, thus making the entire  weaving tight.        Radiating Center.    Step 1. Begin by laying down, in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30889"],[0,"The Mechanism of the Human Voice (#4)"],[1," By it the whole lower part of the chest is flattened and drawn in,  instead of being distended; consequently the lower or larger part of the  lungs is not inflated. It is a method never exercised by nature in a  state of health, but only when, from disease, either the abdominal or  chest muscles cannot act; and it is the method least efficacious in  filling, as it is the one calculated to most fatigue the chest; for it  compresses the vessels and nerves of the throat, and this leads to  engorgement and spasmodic action of the muscles.\"    We may well pause here and give another moment to the consideration of  this most important subject. The lungs, as we have seen, are the bellows  of our vocal organ; they supply the air which is the motive power on  which the voice depends. Without air no tone can be produced. Nay, more,  life itself must cease without it. Breathing goes on regularly while the  voice is silent; but in speaking and singing both inspiration and  expiration have to be regulated according to the nature of the phrases  to be spoken or sung. If the speaker does not know how to take breath  and how to control the expiration, his delivery will of necessity be  jerky and uncertain. But in the singer it is even more important that he  should be able to fill his lungs well, and, having done this, to have  absolute command over his expiration; because while the speaker can  arrange his sentences, his speed, and his breathing-places very much at  his own pleasure, the singer is bound by the music before him. It must,  therefore, be his aim to cultivate a proper method of breathing with the  object of first getting, with the least possible fatigue, the largest  possible amount of air in the most scrupulously careful manner, so as to  prevent even the smallest fraction of it from being wasted. Yet how  seldom is breathing systematically practised as an indispensable  preliminary to the production of tone! I have no hesitation in saying  that the subject is, in many instances, dismissed with a few general  observations. Pupils, of course, take breath somehow, and teachers are  glad to leave this uninteresting part of the business, and to proceed to  the cultivation of the voice.    It may be as well to add that what has been said so far about right and  wrong methods of breathing is not by any means mere theory, but that any  one can convince himself of the truth of the rules laid down by making a  few experiments with the spirometer, an instrument for measuring the  breathing power of the chest by indicating on a dial the exact number of  cubic inches of air expelled from the lungs. This breathing power will  be found to vary according to the way in which the inspiration has been  accomplished. In my own case, for instance, the spirometer should  register, according to the table of comparative height and breathing  power compiled by John Hutchinson, 230 cubic inches. Having suffered  from severe attacks of bleeding from the lungs, my maximum with midriff  and rib breathing is only 220, but with collar-bone breathing I barely  reach 180!    During the Summer Session of the Tonic Sol-fa College I carefully tested  the breathing capacity of ten students, and found that there was an  average excess of midriff and rib breathing over collar-bone breathing  to the extent of 25 cubic inches: the least amount of their increased  power was 12 cubic inches, and the greatest was 45! I imagine that these  figures are more eloquent than any words, and I think it superfluous to  make any further comment on them.    I am strongly of opinion that breathing exercises, especially in the  case of intending public singers, should always be carried on with a  spirometer,[D] because that instrument enables us with the greatest  accuracy to check results which otherwise can only be guessed at.    If this suggestion were acted upon we should certainly no longer be  distressed by that intolerable and never-ceasing tremolo which now so  frequently mars many, in other respects, fine voices. It is a curious,  and at first sight unaccountable, circumstance that this great fault is  specially noticeable amongst French singers. But at the Conservatoire de  Musique in Paris students are deliberately taught the wrong method of  inspiration; for, as we gather from the \"Methode de Chant du  Conservatoire de Musique,\" they are told to \"flatten [or draw in] the  abdomen\" and to \"bulge out the chest.\" Thus the mystery is at once  cleared up, because the tremolo arises almost invariably from a weakness  of the muscles of the midriff or diaphragm, to which attention has  already been called in these pages. Owing to the abdomen being drawn in,  the midriff never properly contracts; the muscles are not sufficiently  exercised, and consequently have not power enough to resist the pressure  that is brought to bear upon them in singing. They tremble, and this  trembling being communicated to the lungs, which are resting upon them,  the stream of air they give forth, loses its evenness and continuity,  with the result I have just stated. It will be seen from the above  explanation that this tremolo, one of the greatest vices besetting  modern singing, and which has hitherto been held by many to be  incurable, may be got rid of completely, though perhaps not very  quickly, by the simple remedy of lung gymnastics on the right principle.  The tremolo may certainly also arise from weakness of some muscles in  the voicebox or larynx, by which the tension of the vocal ligaments is  diminished and increased in rapid alternation. But this is a case for a  medical man, which does not fall within my province to discuss, though I  am justified in saying, on the authority of Mr. Lennox Browne,[E] that  even in many of these cases the effect is clearly attributable to  faulty breathing, since there is seldom any local disease of the larynx;  while exercise on a right method of breathing will cure the spasmodic  action of the laryngeal muscles with but little or no medical treatment.           *       *       *       *       *    I need scarcely add that there is yet another kind of tremolo, which,  being absolutely under the control of the performer, is one of the chief  ornaments of song, and to which the observations just made in no way  apply.           *       *       *       *       *    In addition to the involuntary tremolo there are a number of other  afflictions, \"Clergymen's sore throat\" amongst them, which are admitted  by eminent medical authorities to be due to collar-bone breathing, and  which may be entirely cured by proper lung gymnastics, or, in other  words, by breathing exercises on the right principle; that is to say, by  calling into play the muscles of the abdomen and of the lower part of  the chest. This is a subject which is little understood by singers and  public speakers, many of whom would be amazed at the sometimes most  wonderful results produced by such simple means. I will therefore quote  a case in point which came under my notice quite recently, and which  will give the reader an idea of the importance of proper breathing:    Mr. X, a tall thin young man, engaged in evangelistic work, suffered  from a \"weakness of voice,\" which he found a great hindrance to his  success. He therefore consulted Mr. Lennox Browne, who at once told him  that he had no disease of any kind, and sent him to me for a course of  breathing exercises. I found that Mr. X chiefly spoke in a child's  voice, over which, moreover, he had very little control; and when I  requested him to take a deep inspiration, he drew in his abdomen, bulged  out his chest, and raised his collar-bones. The spirometer only  registered 200 cubic inches instead of 260, which, according to  Hutchinson's table, was his mean.    My course was, therefore, plain. I made him stand in an easy natural  position, neither allowing him to bulge out his chest, nor to draw in  the abdomen, and then instructed him how to acquire some control over  his midriff and the lower muscles of the chest. It may be observed here,  in passing, that we can, in a state of health, contract and relax these  muscles at will, just as easily as we can bend a finger, and that this  power, when lost through disuse, can be regained with little difficulty.  In Mr. X's case this process was particularly speedy, with the result of  increasing his breathing power in two lessons by 60 cubic inches. In one  additional week I could dismiss him with a full sonorous man's voice, in  place of the uncertain child's squeak with which he came to me. It is no  exaggeration to say that this young man left me with a _new_ voice, and  if people had heard him when he first came to me, behind a screen, and  again after the last lesson, they would certainly not have believed that  they were listening to the same person. What Mr. X and his friends think  of his case may be seen from the following letter which he wrote me on  July 6th, 1880:--\"Now that a week has passed since the last lesson I had  from you, I write to bear testimony to the wonderful benefit to my voice  obtained through the very short course I took. My friends are quite  astonished at the marked difference, and I beg you will accept my most  sincere thanks,\" &c.    Many similar cases might be mentioned, but the one just quoted is  sufficient, and I will sum the matter up with a few remarks which Mr.  Lennox Browne made as chairman at my lecture at the Aldersgate Street  Literary Institution, on October 9th, 1880. He then said that, in his  medical experience, he found that persons who suffered from their voices  generally owed their ailments to bad habits of using the voice, and not  to any defect in the larynx or resonance chamber. In several cases  lately he had sent such patients to Herr Behnke, who had given them  lessons in correct breathing, and who had thereby, and without any  medicine, galvanism, or other aid, restored their voices in a remarkably  short time.
