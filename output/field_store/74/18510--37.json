I ought to say, too, that some of the oaks  perfect acorns from blossoms in one year, while others must grow through  two seasons before they are mature. Botanically, the oak family is  nearly a world family, and we Americans, though possessed of many  species, have no monopoly of it. Indeed, if I may dare to refer the  reader to that great storehouse of words, the Encyclopaedia Britannica, I  think he will find that the oak is there very British, and that the  English oak, surely a magnificent tree in England anyway, is  patriotically glorified to the writer.    But we want to talk of some of our own oaks. The one thoroughly  characteristic is surely the noble white oak, a tree most admirable in  every way, and most widely distributed over the Northern States. Its  majestic form, as it towers high above the ordinary works of man,  conveys the repose of conscious strength to the beholder. There is a  great oak in Connecticut to which I make pilgrimages, and from which I  always get a message of rest and peace. There it stands, strong,  full-powered, minding little the most furious storms, a benediction to  every one who will but lift his eyes. There it has stood in full majesty  for years unknown, for it was a great oak, so run the title-deeds, way  back in 1636, when first the white man began to own land in the  Connecticut Valley. At first sight it seems not large, for its perfect  symmetry conceals its great size; but its impression grows as one looks  at it, until it seems to fill the whole landscape. I have sat under it  in spring, when yet its leafy canopy was incomplete; I have looked into  its green depths in midsummer, when its grateful shadow refreshed the  highway; I have seen the sun set in redness beyond its bare limbs, the  snowy countryside emphasizing its noble lines; I have tried to fathom  the mystery in its sturdy heart overhead when the full moon rode in the  sky; and always that \"great oak of Glastonbury\" has soothed and cheered  and rested, and taken me nearer the Giver of all such good to restless  humanity.    Do I wonder at my friend who has built his home where he may look always  at this white oak, or that he raged in anger when a crabbed neighbor  ruthlessly cut down a superb tree of the same kind that was on his  property line, in order that he might run his barbed-wire fence  straight? No; I agree with him that this tree-murderer has probably a  barbed-wire heart, and we expect that his future existence will be  treeless, at least!    [Illustration: The swamp white oak in early spring]    Sometimes this same white oak adapts itself to the bank of a stream,  though its true character develops best in the drier ground. Its  strength has been its bane, for the value of its timber has caused many  a great isolated specimen to be cut down. It is fine to know that some  States--Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island also, I think--have  given to trees along highways, and in situations where they are part of  the highway landscape, the protection of a wise law. Under this law each  town appoints a tree-warden, serving without pay (and therefore with  love), who may seal to the town by his label such trees as are truly the  common possession, regardless of whose land they happen to be on. If the  owner desires to cut down a tree thus designated, he must first obtain  permission, after stating satisfactory reasons, of the annual  town-meeting, and this is not so easy as to make cutting very frequent.  The whole country should have such a law, and I should enjoy its  application right here in Pennsylvania, where oaks of a hundred years  have been cut down to make room for a whisky sign, and where a superb  pin-oak that I passed today is devoted to an ignominious use. If I may  venture to become hortatory, let me say that the responsibility for the  preservation of the all-too-few remaining great primeval trees, and of  their often notable progeny, in our Eastern States, rests with those who  care for trees, not alone with those who ought to care. To talk about  the greatness and beauty of a fine oak or maple or tulip, to call  attention to its shade value, and to appeal to the cupidity of the  ground owner by estimating how much less his property will be worth  when the trees are gone or have been mishandled, will aid to create the  necessary public sentiment. And to provide wise laws, as may be often  done with proper attention, is the plain duty and the high privilege of  the tree-loving citizen. The trees are defenseless, and they are often  unreplaceable; if you love them protect them as you would your children.    The white-oak leaf is the most familiar and characteristic, perhaps, of  the family; but other species, close to the white oak in habit, show  foliage of a very different appearance. The swamp white oak, for  instance, is a noble tree, and in winter particularly its irregular  branches give it an especial expression of rugged strength as it grows  along a brookside; but its leaves smooth up on the edges, giving only a  hint of the deep serrations that typify its upland brother. Deeply green  above are these leaves and softly white below, and in late summer there  appears, here and there, on a stout stem, a most attractive acorn of  large size. Its curious cup gives a hint, or more than a hint, as to the  special designating character of another oak, the mossy-cup or bur. This  latter species is beautiful in its habit, rich in its foliage, and the  fringed or mossed acorns are of a remarkable size.    [Illustration: An old post-oak]    Of all the oaks, the sturdy but not lofty post-oak spreads the richest  display of foliage. Its peculiar habit leads to the even placing of its  violoncello-shaped leaves, and its generous crop of acorns gives added  distinction in late summer. It is fine in the forest, and a notable  ornament anywhere.    It has been said that a proper penance for an offending botanist would  be a compulsory separation and description of the involved and  complicated goldenrod family; and I would suggest that a second edition  of the same penance might be a requirement to name off-hand the first  dozen oak trees the same poor botanist might meet. So much do the  foliage, the bark, and the habit of growth vary, and so considerable is  the difference between individuals of the same species, that the wisest  expert is likely to be the most conservative. An unbotanical observer,  who comes at the family just because he loves trees in general, and is  poking his eyes and his camera into unusual places, doesn't make close  determinations; he tells what he thinks he sees, and leaves exact work  to the scientists.    [Illustration: A blooming twig of the swamp white oak]    There are some oaks, however, that have borrowed the foliage of other  trees so cunningly that one at first scouts the possibility of the  Quercus parentage, until he sees an undeniable acorn thrusting itself  forward. Then he is sure that what seemed a rather peculiarly shaped  chestnut tree, with somewhat stumpy foliage, is none other than the  chestnut-oak. A fine tree it is, too, this same chestnut-oak, with its  masquerading foliage of deep green, its upright and substantial habit,  its rather long and aristocratic-looking acorns. The authorities tell  that its wood, too, is brownish and valuable; but we tree-lovers are not  enthusiastic over mere timber values, because that means the killing of  the trees.    The willow-oak will not deceive, because its habit is so oak-like and so  willow-less; but its foliage is surely borrowed from its graceful and  more rapidly growing neighbor. Not so large, by any means, as the white  oak or the chestnut-oak, it has somewhat rough and reddish bark, and its  acorns are perfected in the second year of their growth, close to the  twigs, in the way of the pin-oak. The general aspect of the tree is  upright, rather than spreading, and it partakes thus of the maple  character in its landscape effect. The willow-oak is one of the species  I would, if I were writing a tree-planting article, heartily commend to  those who wish to add adornment to the countryside that shall be  permanent and satisfactory. Just a hint here: nursery-grown oaks, now  obtainable from any modern establishment, have usually been frequently  moved or transplanted, as the trade term goes, and this means that they  have established a somewhat self-contained root system, which will give  them far greater vigor and cause them to take hold sooner when finally  placed in a situation where they are to be permanent features. The  reason is plain: the forest seedling, in the fierce struggle for  existence usually prevailing, must send its roots far and wide for food,  and when it is dug out their feeding capacity is so seriously curtailed  as to check the growth of the tree for many years. The nursery-grown  tree, on the contrary, has been brought up \"by hand,\" and its food has  always been convenient to it, leading to more rapid growth and a more  compact root system. I only interject this prosaic fact here in the hope  that some of my tree-loving readers will undertake to plant some oaks  instead of only the soft-wooded and less permanent maples, poplars, and  the like.    Another simulative leaf is that of the laurel-oak, and it is color and  gloss as well as shape that have been borrowed from its humbler  neighbor in the forest. The shining green of the laurel is seen in these  oak leaves; they are also half evergreen, thus being one of the family  particularly belonging to our Southern States, and hardly enduring the  chill of the winters north of Virginia.

Slowly they moved toward the Tube  entrance, none of them speaking.    [Illustration]    At the lip, Franks turned. \"We are going back because we have no choice.  There are three of us and about a dozen of you. However, if--\"    \"Here comes the car,\" Taylor said.    There was a grating sound from the Tube. D-class leadys moved toward the  edge to receive it.    \"I am sorry,\" the leader said, \"but it is for your protection. We are  watching over you, literally. You must stay below and let us conduct the  war. In a sense, it has come to be _our_ war. We must fight it as we see  fit.\"    The car rose to the surface.    Twelve soldiers, armed with Bender pistols, stepped from it and  surrounded the three men.    Moss breathed a sigh of relief. \"Well, this does change things. It came  off just right.\"    The leader moved back, away from the soldiers. It studied them  intently, glancing from one to the next, apparently trying to make up  its mind. At last it made a sign to the other leadys. They coasted aside  and a corridor was opened up toward the warehouse.    \"Even now,\" the leader said, \"we could send you back by force. But it is  evident that this is not really an observation party at all. These  soldiers show that you have much more in mind; this was all carefully  prepared.\"    \"Very carefully,\" Franks said.    They closed in.    \"How much more, we can only guess. I must admit that we were taken  unprepared. We failed utterly to meet the situation. Now force would be  absurd, because neither side can afford to injure the other; we, because  of the restrictions placed on us regarding human life, you because the  war demands--\"    The soldiers fired, quick and in fright. Moss dropped to one knee,  firing up. The leader dissolved in a cloud of particles. On all sides  D- and B-class leadys were rushing up, some with weapons, some with  metal slats. The room was in confusion. Off in the distance a siren was  screaming. Franks and Taylor were cut off from the others, separated  from the soldiers by a wall of metal bodies.    \"They can't fire back,\" Franks said calmly. \"This is another bluff.  They've tried to bluff us all the way.\" He fired into the face of a  leady. The leady dissolved. \"They can only try to frighten us. Remember  that.\"           *       *       *       *       *    They went on firing and leady after leady vanished. The room reeked with  the smell of burning metal, the stink of fused plastic and steel. Taylor  had been knocked down. He was struggling to find his gun, reaching  wildly among metal legs, groping frantically to find it. His fingers  strained, a handle swam in front of him. Suddenly something came down on  his arm, a metal foot. He cried out.    Then it was over. The leadys were moving away, gathering together off to  one side. Only four of the Surface Council remained. The others were  radioactive particles in the air. D-class leadys were already restoring  order, gathering up partly destroyed metal figures and bits and removing  them.    Franks breathed a shuddering sigh.    \"All right,\" he said. \"You can take us back to the windows. It won't be  long now.\"    The leadys separated, and the human group, Moss and Franks and Taylor  and the soldiers, walked slowly across the room, toward the door. They  entered the Council Chamber. Already a faint touch of gray mitigated the  blackness of the windows.    \"Take us outside,\" Franks said impatiently. \"We'll see it directly, not  in here.\"    A door slid open. A chill blast of cold morning air rushed in, chilling  them even through their lead suits. The men glanced at each other  uneasily.    \"Come on,\" Franks said. \"Outside.\"    He walked out through the door, the others following him.    They were on a hill, overlooking the vast bowl of a valley. Dimly,  against the graying sky, the outline of mountains were forming, becoming  tangible.    \"It'll be bright enough to see in a few minutes,\" Moss said. He  shuddered as a chilling wind caught him and moved around him. \"It's  worth it, really worth it, to see this again after eight years. Even if  it's the last thing we see--\"    \"Watch,\" Franks snapped.    They obeyed, silent and subdued. The sky was clearing, brightening each  moment. Some place far off, echoing across the valley, a rooster crowed.    \"A chicken!\" Taylor murmured. \"Did you hear?\"    Behind them, the leadys had come out and were standing silently,  watching, too. The gray sky turned to white and the hills appeared more  clearly. Light spread across the valley floor, moving toward them.    \"God in heaven!\" Franks exclaimed.    Trees, trees and forests. A valley of plants and trees, with a few roads  winding among them. Farmhouses. A windmill. A barn, far down below them.    \"Look!\" Moss whispered.    Color came into the sky. The Sun was approaching. Birds began to sing.  Not far from where they stood, the leaves of a tree danced in the wind.    Franks turned to the row of leadys behind them.    \"Eight years. We were tricked. There was no war. As soon as we left the  surface--\"    \"Yes,\" an A-class leady admitted. \"As soon as you left, the war ceased.  You're right, it was a hoax. You worked hard undersurface, sending up  guns and weapons, and we destroyed them as fast as they came up.\"    \"But why?\" Taylor asked, dazed. He stared down at the vast valley below.  \"Why?\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"You created us,\" the leady said, \"to pursue the war for you, while you  human beings went below the ground in order to survive. But before we  could continue the war, it was necessary to analyze it to determine what  its purpose was. We did this, and we found that it had no purpose,  except, perhaps, in terms of human needs. Even this was questionable.    \"We investigated further. We found that human cultures pass through  phases, each culture in its own time. As the culture ages and begins to  lose its objectives, conflict arises within it between those who wish to  cast it off and set up a new culture-pattern, and those who wish to  retain the old with as little change as possible.    \"At this point, a great danger appears. The conflict within threatens to  engulf the society in self-war, group against group. The vital  traditions may be lost--not merely altered or reformed, but completely  destroyed in this period of chaos and anarchy. We have found many such  examples in the history of mankind.    \"It is necessary for this hatred within the culture to be directed  outward, toward an external group, so that the culture itself may  survive its crisis. War is the result. War, to a logical mind, is  absurd. But in terms of human needs, it plays a vital role. And it will  continue to until Man has grown up enough so that no hatred lies within  him.\"    Taylor was listening intently. \"Do you think this time will come?\"    \"Of course. It has almost arrived now. This is the last war. Man is  _almost_ united into one final culture--a world culture. At this point  he stands continent against continent, one half of the world against the  other half. Only a single step remains, the jump to a unified culture.  Man has climbed slowly upward, tending always toward unification of his  culture. It will not be long--    \"But it has not come yet, and so the war had to go on, to satisfy the  last violent surge of hatred that Man felt. Eight years have passed  since the war began. In these eight years, we have observed and noted  important changes going on in the minds of men. Fatigue and disinterest,  we have seen, are gradually taking the place of hatred and fear. The  hatred is being exhausted gradually, over a period of time. But for the  present, the hoax must go on, at least for a while longer. You are not  ready to learn the truth. You would want to continue the war.\"    \"But how did you manage it?\" Moss asked. \"All the photographs, the  samples, the damaged equipment--\"    \"Come over here.\" The leady directed them toward a long, low building.  \"Work goes on constantly, whole staffs laboring to maintain a coherent  and convincing picture of a global war.\"           *       *       *       *       *    They entered the building. Leadys were working everywhere, poring over  tables and desks.    \"Examine this project here,\" the A-class leady said. Two leadys were  carefully photographing something, an elaborate model on a table top.  \"It is a good example.\"    The men grouped around, trying to see. It was a model of a ruined city.    Taylor studied it in silence for a long time. At last he looked up.    \"It's San Francisco,\" he said in a low voice. \"This is a model of San  Francisco, destroyed. I saw this on the vidscreen, piped down to us. The  bridges were hit--\"    \"Yes, notice the bridges.\" The leady traced the ruined span with his  metal finger, a tiny spider-web, almost invisible. \"You have no doubt  seen photographs of this many times, and of the other tables in this  building.    \"San Francisco itself is completely intact. We restored it soon after  you left, rebuilding the parts that had been damaged at the start of the  war. The work of manufacturing news goes on all the time in this  particular building. We are very careful to see that each part fits in  with all the other parts. Much time and effort are devoted to it.\"    Franks touched one of the tiny model buildings, lying half in ruins. \"So  this is what you spend your time doing--making model cities and then  blasting them.\"    \"No, we do much more. We are caretakers, watching over the whole world.  The owners have left for a time, and we must see that the cities are  kept clean, that decay is prevented, that everything is kept oiled and  in running condition. The gardens, the streets, the water mains,  everything must be maintained as it was eight years ago, so that when  the owners return, they will not be displeased. We want to be sure that  they will be completely satisfied.\"    "]]]
