In 1766 he  obtained an advantageous engagement as oboist at Bath, and soon after  the position of organist at the Octagon Chapel was offered to him and  accepted. This was a great and important change.    Bath was then, as now, one of the most beautiful cities in England, and  the resort of the fashion and rank of the kingdom, who came to take the  waters. It is beautifully situated on both sides of the Avon, and has  many fine walks and public buildings. The aspect of the city is markedly  cheerful and brilliant, owing to the nature of the white stone of which  the principal houses are built, and to the exquisite amphitheatre of  hills in which they lie.    The society was then gay and polite, and HERSCHEL was at once thrown  into a far more intelligent atmosphere than that he had just left in  Yorkshire. It was easy to get new books, to see new faces, to hear new  things. The Assembly Rooms (built in 1771) were noted for their size and  elegance; the theatre was the best out of London.    His position as organist of the fashionable chapel placed him in the  current. His charming and engaging manners made him friends. His talents  brought him admirers and pupils, and pupils brought him money.[7]    He began in 1766 a life of unceasing activity, which continued. In 1768  he published in London a symphony (in C) for two violins, viola, bass,  two oboes, and two horns, and in the same year two military concertos  for two oboes, two horns, two trumpets, and two bassoons.[8] He wrote  pieces for the harp, glees, \"catches,\" and other songs for the  voice. One of these, the _Echo Catch_, was published and had even  considerable vogue.        A competent musical critic writes to me of this work: \"The      counterpoint is clear and flowing, and is managed with considerable      taste and effect. It would be difficult to explain the great      cleverness shown in the construction of the _Catch_ without diagrams      to illustrate the movements of the parts. It is certainly an      ingenious bit of musical writing.\"    When he left Bath (in 1782), many of these musical writings were lost,  in his great haste to take up his new profession. One, specially, his  sister remembers to have written out for the printer, \"but he could not  find a moment to send it off, nor answer the printer's letters.\" This  was a four-part song, \"In thee I bear so dear a part.\" He wrote very  many anthems, chants, and psalm-tunes for the excellent cathedral choir  of the Octagon Chapel. Unfortunately, most of this music is now not to  be found.    A notice of HERSCHEL'S life which appeared in the _European Magazine_  for 1785, January, gives a very lively picture of his life at this  time, and it is especially valuable as showing how he appeared to his  cotemporaries.        \"Although Mr. HERSCHEL loved music to an excess, and made a      considerable progress in it, he yet determined with a sort of      enthusiasm to devote every moment he could spare from business to      the pursuit of knowledge, which he regarded as the sovereign good,      and in which he resolved to place all his views of future happiness      in life.\". . .        \"His situation at the Octagon Chapel proved a very profitable one,      as he soon fell into all the public business of the concerts, the      Rooms, the Theatre, and the oratorios, besides many scholars and      private concerts. This great run of business, instead of lessening      his propensity to study, increased it, so that many times, after a      fatiguing day of fourteen or sixteen hours spent in his vocation, he      would retire at night with the greatest avidity to _unbend the      mind_, if it may be so called, with a few propositions in      MACLAURIN'S _Fluxions_, or other books of that sort.\"    It was in these years that he mastered Italian and made some progress  in Greek.        \"We may hazard a natural conjecture respecting the course of      HERSCHEL'S early studies. Music conducted him to mathematics, or,      in other words, impelled him to study SMITH'S _Harmonics_. Now this      ROBERT SMITH was the author of _A Complete System of Optics_,      a masterly work, which, notwithstanding the rapid growth of that      branch of the science, is not yet wholly superseded. It seems to us      not unlikely that HERSCHEL, studying the _Harmonics_, conceived a      reverence for the author, who was at that time still living, so that      from the _Philosophy of Music_ he passed to the _Optics_, a work on      which SMITH'S great reputation chiefly rested; and thus undesignedly      prepared himself for the career on which he was shortly about to      enter with so much glory.\"[9]    There is no doubt that this conjecture is a true one. The _Optics_ of  Dr. SMITH is one of the very few books quoted by HERSCHEL throughout his  writings, and there is every evidence of his complete familiarity with  its conclusions and methods; and this familiarity is of the kind which a  student acquires with his early text-books. One other work he quotes in  the same way, LALANDE'S _Astronomy_, and this too must have been deeply  studied.    During the years 1765-1772, while HERSCHEL was following his profession  and his studies at Bath, the family life at Hanover went on in much the  same way.    In 1765 his father ISAAC had a stroke of paralysis, which ended his  violin-playing forever, and forced him to depend entirely upon pupils  and copying of music for a livelihood. He died on March 22, 1767,  leaving behind him a good name, and living in the affectionate  remembrance of his children and of all who knew him.    CAROLINA had now lost her best friend, and transferred to her brother  WILLIAM the affection she had before divided between him and her father.        \"My father wished to give me something like a polished education,      but my mother was particularly determined that it should be a rough,      but at the same time a useful one; and nothing farther she thought      was necessary but to send me two or three months to a sempstress to      be taught to make household linen. . . . My mother would not consent      to my being taught French, and my brother Dietrich was even denied a      dancing-master, because she would not permit my learning along with      him, though the entrance had been paid for us both; so all my father      could do for me was to indulge me (and please himself) sometimes      with a short lesson on the violin, when my mother was either in      good humor or out of the way. Though I have often felt myself      exceedingly at a loss for the want of those few accomplishments of      which I was thus, by an erroneous though well-meant opinion of my      mother, deprived, I could not help thinking but that she had cause      for wishing me not to know more than was necessary for being useful      in the family; for it was her certain belief that my brother WILLIAM      would have returned to his country, and my eldest brother not have      looked so high, if they had had a little less learning.              *       *       *       *       *        But sometimes I found it scarcely possible to get through with the      work required, and felt very unhappy that no time at all was left      for improving myself in music or fancy work, in which I had an      opportunity of receiving some instruction from an ingenious young      woman whose parents lived in the same house with us. But the time      wanted for spending a few hours together could only be obtained by      our meeting at daybreak, because by the time of the family's rising      at seven, I was obliged to be at my daily business. Though I had      neither time nor means for producing anything immediately either for      show or use, I was content with keeping samples of all possible      patterns in needlework, beads, bugles, horse-hair, etc., for I could      not help feeling troubled sometimes about my future destiny; yet I      could not bear the idea of being turned into an Abigail or      housemaid, and thought that with the above and such like      acquirements, with a little notion of music, I might obtain a place      as governess in some family where the want of a knowledge of French      would be no objection.\"    A change was soon to come in her life too; her brother WILLIAM wrote  to propose that she should join him at Bath--        . . . \"to make the trial, if, by his instruction, I might not become      a useful singer for his winter concerts and oratorios; he advised my      brother JACOB to give me some lessons by way of beginning; but that      if, after a trial of two years, we should not find it answer our      expectation, he would bring me back again. This at first seemed to      be agreeable to all parties, but by the time I had set my heart upon      this change in my situation, JACOB began to turn the whole scheme      into ridicule, and, of course, he never heard the sound of my voice      except in speaking, and yet I was left in the harassing uncertainty      whether I was to go or not. I resolved at last to prepare, as far as      lay in my power, for both cases, by taking, in the first place,      every opportunity, when all were from home, to imitate, with a gag      between my teeth, the solo parts of concertos, _shake and all_, such      as I had heard them play on the violin; in consequence I had gained      a tolerable execution before I knew how to sing. I next began to      knit ruffles, which were intended for my brother WILLIAM, in case I      remained at home--else they were to be JACOB'S.

They are now just real good  comrades, and seem to help each other in being orderly, polite, and  studious. How did you do it?\"    \"Perhaps all credit is not due to me, but I will say that I gave Carl  the instruction I thought he needed and he has passed the good word  along. Several of the boys have met with me once a month to study  concerning themselves, and I can see that they have grown to have a  reverence for themselves and a deep regard for all womanhood. Carl was  in last evening, and said, 'Dr. Barrett, I am so glad Miss Bell sent me  with that note to you, for your talk to me that night has changed my  whole life, I know. I feel so much cleaner all through, and have so much  more respect for myself. And I think so differently of girls and women,  and especially of my mother, and I realize as I never did before how  important a thing it is to be almost a man.'\"          A GATEWAY AND A GIFT.      Three gateways span the path of earthly existence: one at the entrance  which we call the gate of birth; one at the close which we call the gate  of death, and one at the entrance to the wondrous Land of the Teens,  which we call the gate of manhood or of womanhood. At each of these  gates a wonderful gift is presented to each individual. At the gate of  birth it is the gift of earthly life, at death it is the gift of  continued life, and at the gate which opens into the Land of the Teens  it is the gift of creative life. You see that each gift is of life.    The path of earthly life, beginning at the gateway of birth, passes  through the sunny meadow-land of Childhood, and also through a strange,  mysterious land to which we have referred as the Land of the Teens,  before reaching the Heights of Maturity. This Land of the Teens is  peculiar in that the inhabitants are neither children nor adults, and  yet, with the inexperience of children, they have many of the desires  and emotions of grown-up people. This constitutes an element of great  danger, while another source of danger is the fact that adequate  guidance is not always given in this transition period, or, if  proffered, is proudly rejected by those who think that being in their  \"teens\" makes them wise above that which is written.    When we visit foreign lands we are grateful for guidance and direction,  especially if we are not acquainted with the language; so, if we do not  hire a guide we, at least, buy a guide-book. It seems to me, then, that  we ought not to rebel against guides through the Land of the Teens,  realizing that one who has traveled through a country can point out  beauties and warn against dangers which would not be recognized by the  inexperienced traveler.    We can visit England, Italy, or Germany many times, and at each journey  can profit by former experiences, but we pass through the Land of the  Teens but once, and the lessons we learn on that journey we can only  utilize for the benefit of others. This is why many people on the  Heights of Maturity are anxious to light a beacon for those who are  still in their \"teens.\" They would gladly help others to shun the  by-paths where they have met disaster, for they have learned the very  solemn truth that in youth one is determining what maturity shall be.  The seeds sown in the sunny meadow of Childhood and in the broader  fields of the Land of the Teens are harvested in the uplands of  Maturity, and the harvest is always greater than the seed sown. The  petulance and pouting of the child hardens into the gruffness,  bad-temper, and moroseness of the man; the idleness and shirking of the  youth becomes the shiftlessness and unreliability of the adult; the  boy's neglect of duty and unwearied search for pleasure may be harvested  in dissipation and ruin in mature life. It is, then, a very serious  thing to be passing through one's \"teens,\" and the wise youth will  welcome any guide who will show him a safe path. May I claim the  privilege of acting for a little time in that capacity?    The King of this land has made laws for its government and wisdom, has  builded paths wherein one may walk in safety. The laws made by the King  are not harsh and cruel, but are beneficent, and he denies no real good.  He says to the traveler, \"You belong to me, and I am desirous of your  highest welfare; therefore, obey me and you shall be rewarded; disobey  me and you shall be punished.\" It needs some moral courage to bravely  stay in the path of Wisdom, for there are many allurements to leave it;  more particularly as the inexperience of the traveler does not warn him  of the dangers of following pleasures that lead away from wisdom's ways.  The guide worthy of trust must not fail to point out these dangers; and  the prudent youth will listen to the warning voice and walk in Wisdom's  ways, for \"all her ways are pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\"    We talk much about our personal liberty, and assert that we have a right  to live in Maine or California, but we have not that much liberty in  regard to dwelling in the Land of the Teens. If we are ever to reach the  Heights of Maturity we must spend ten years in the Teens. We cannot sell  our domain, nor give it away, and we cannot even hire some one to  cultivate it for us. This being the case, it becomes important for us  to study the soil and how best to develop its advantages.    We find that the land has three divisions: the Domain of the Body, the  Field of Intellect, and the Garden of the Heart,--the same divisions  that exist in the Sunny Land of Childhood, and that we have been  cultivating ever since we were born. These are the kingdoms which came  to us with the gift of life. We recognize that the gifts which come to  us at birth and death are of life for ourselves alone, and we have had  no thought during our childish years except to develop our powers for  our own advantage. It may be we have not felt perfectly satisfied with  our lot in life, but we have felt that we were not responsible for this.  We did not choose to be born in America instead of Asia, though we do  not rebel at this fact. We did not select to be white instead of black.  It is not our fault if we are born of a family in which consumption is  an inheritance; and, on the other hand, we can claim no credit to  ourselves if we have inherited strong bodies with healthful tendencies.  It is our misfortune, and not our fault, if we are not quite perfectly  poised by nature; it is our good fortune, not our foresight, if we have  genius instead of mediocrity. The gifts that come to us through  inheritance are ours without blame or credit to us but they bring with  them the responsibility of their use. We are responsible for maintaining  or increasing our dower of health by obedience to physical laws;  responsible for the cultivation of our intellects, for the development  of inherited virtues, and the annihilation of inherited vices.    If you study your characteristics and talents you find that they repeat  those of your ancestry. Your eyes, hair, mouth, chin, your stature,  figure, complexion, your talents, capabilities, tendencies, your likes  and dislikes, your faults as well as your virtues are repetitions of  those who preceded you in this living network of existence of which you  form a part. If you are not like father or mother you may be like  grandfather or great-grandmother. If you do not find yourself repeating  the characteristics or personality of any one ancestor, you may find  yourself a composite photograph of several. And even if you cannot trace  in yourself a likeness to any family representative, you may still be  assured that from some of them your traits have come to you. You have  only to recall the complexity of your sources of inheritance and then  remember how many words can be spelled from the twenty-six letters of  the alphabet to see that you can hardly measure the peculiar forces of  mind and body that may come to you though that power of transmission  which we call heredity.    It may occur to you to ask why, if we are not responsible for our  inheritances, is it needful to give them any particular thought? There  are two reasons why we should consider the good and bad characteristics  which may be ours through inheritance. In the first place, heredity is  not fatality, and we are not absolutely obliged to follow the paths  which our ancestors marked out for us, and in the second place, we can,  by understanding our own characters, mark out better paths for our  posterity. We are not only receivers of life, but we may be also givers  of life, and this is the gift that comes to you at the entrance to the  Land of the Teens. Can you imagine a more important period in the life  of an individual than that point where is intrusted to him the physical  powers which make him the arbiter of the destiny of those who come after  him?    The gift of possible life for others is even more marvelous than that of  actual life for one's self and brings with it greater responsibility. It  is accompanied with marked physical changes. You have observed them in  yourself, though you perhaps have not understood them. Up to this time  you have been but a child, and all your physical forces have been  occupied in keeping you alive and growing. But you are now to become a  man, with powers that will unite you to the race; powers that will give  you the ability to form a new link in the living chain that now ends  with you. You have noticed the rapid unfolding of your bodily powers;  you have become conscious of new and strange emotions; you have, it may  be, found yourself becoming irritable and have felt bewildered with the  new aspects of life and have wondered what it all means. It may be you  have felt as did one boy who said to his mother, to whom he confided all  his problems of life: \"Mamma, I want to kick and cry, and I don't know  why.\" The mother knew. She understood the strange"]]]
