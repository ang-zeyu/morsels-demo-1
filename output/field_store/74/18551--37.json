[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3069"],[0,"The Great Boer War (#4)"],[1," upon a  municipal council in a city which he had built himself. Unfortunately,  however, 'the evil that men do lives after them,' and the ignorant Boer  farmer continued to imagine that his southern relatives were in bondage,  just as the descendant of the Irish emigrant still pictures an Ireland  of penal laws and an alien Church.    For twenty-five years after the Sand River Convention the burghers  of the South African Republic had pursued a strenuous and violent  existence, fighting incessantly with the natives and sometimes with  each other, with an occasional fling at the little Dutch republic to the  south. The semi-tropical sun was waking strange ferments in the placid  Friesland blood, and producing a race who added the turbulence and  restlessness of the south to the formidable tenacity of the north.  Strong vitality and violent ambitions produced feuds and rivalries  worthy of medieval Italy, and the story of the factious little  communities is like a chapter out of Guicciardini. Disorganisation  ensued. The burghers would not pay taxes and the treasury was empty. One  fierce Kaffir tribe threatened them from the north, and the Zulus on  the east. It is an exaggeration of English partisans to pretend that our  intervention saved the Boers, for no one can read their military history  without seeing that they were a match for Zulus and Sekukuni combined.  But certainly a formidable invasion was pending, and the scattered  farmhouses were as open to the Kaffirs as our farmers' homesteads were  in the American colonies when the Indians were on the warpath. Sir  Theophilus Shepstone, the British Commissioner, after an inquiry of  three months, solved all questions by the formal annexation of the  country. The fact that he took possession of it with a force of  some twenty-five men showed the honesty of his belief that no armed  resistance was to be feared. This, then, in 1877 was a complete reversal  of the Sand River Convention and the opening of a new chapter in the  history of South Africa.    There did not appear to be any strong feeling at the time against the  annexation. The people were depressed with their troubles and weary of  contention. Burgers, the President, put in a formal protest, and took  up his abode in Cape Colony, where he had a pension from the British  Government. A memorial against the measure received the signatures of a  majority of the Boer inhabitants, but there was a fair minority who took  the other view. Kruger himself accepted a paid office under Government.  There was every sign that the people, if judiciously handled, would  settle down under the British flag. It is even asserted that they would  themselves have petitioned for annexation had it been longer withheld.  With immediate constitutional government it is possible that even  the most recalcitrant of them might have been induced to lodge their  protests in the ballot boxes rather than in the bodies of our soldiers.    But the empire has always had poor luck in South Africa, and never  worse than on that occasion. Through no bad faith, but simply through  preoccupation and delay, the promises made were not instantly fulfilled.  Simple primitive men do not understand the ways of our circumlocution  offices, and they ascribe to duplicity what is really red tape and  stupidity. If the Transvaalers had waited they would have had their  Volksraad and all that they wanted. But the British Government had some  other local matters to set right, the rooting out of Sekukuni and the  breaking of the Zulus, before they would fulfill their pledges. The  delay was keenly resented. And we were unfortunate in our choice of  Governor. The burghers are a homely folk, and they like an occasional  cup of coffee with the anxious man who tries to rule them. The three  hundred pounds a year of coffee money allowed by the Transvaal to its  President is by no means a mere form. A wise administrator would fall  into the sociable and democratic habits of the people. Sir Theophilus  Shepstone did so. Sir Owen Lanyon did not. There was no Volksraad and  no coffee, and the popular discontent grew rapidly. In three years the  British had broken up the two savage hordes which had been threatening  the land. The finances, too, had been restored. The reasons which had  made so many favour the annexation were weakened by the very power which  had every interest in preserving them.    It cannot be too often pointed out that in this annexation, the  starting-point of our troubles, Great Britain, however mistaken she may  have been, had no obvious selfish interest in view. There were no Rand  mines in those days, nor was there anything in the country to tempt the  most covetous. An empty treasury and two native wars were the reversion  which we took over. It was honestly considered that the country was  in too distracted a state to govern itself, and had, by its weakness,  become a scandal and a danger to its neighbours. There was nothing  sordid in our action, though it may have been both injudicious and  high-handed.    In December 1880 the Boers rose. Every farmhouse sent out its riflemen,  and the trysting-place was the outside of the nearest British fort. All  through the country small detachments were surrounded and besieged  by the farmers. Standerton, Pretoria, Potchefstroom, Lydenburg,  Wakkerstroom, Rustenberg, and Marabastad were all invested and all  held out until the end of the war. In the open country we were less  fortunate. At Bronkhorst Spruit a small British force was taken by  surprise and shot down without harm to their antagonists. The surgeon  who treated them has left it on record that the average number of  wounds was five per man. At Laing's Nek an inferior force of British  endeavoured to rush a hill which was held by Boer riflemen. Half of our  men were killed and wounded. Ingogo may be called a drawn battle, though  our loss was more heavy than that of the enemy. Finally came the  defeat of Majuba Hill, where four hundred infantry upon a mountain were  defeated and driven off by a swarm of sharpshooters who advanced under  the cover of boulders. Of all these actions there was not one which  was more than a skirmish, and had they been followed by a final British  victory they would now be hardly remembered. It is the fact that they  were skirmishes which succeeded in their object which has given them  an importance which is exaggerated. At the same time they may mark the  beginning of a new military era, for they drove home the fact--only too  badly learned by us--that it is the rifle and not the drill which makes  the soldier. It is bewildering that after such an experience the  British military authorities continued to serve out only three hundred  cartridges a year for rifle practice, and that they still encouraged  that mechanical volley firing which destroys all individual aim. With  the experience of the first Boer war behind them, little was done,  either in tactics or in musketry, to prepare the soldier for the second.  The value of the mounted rifleman, the shooting with accuracy at unknown  ranges, the art of taking cover--all were equally neglected.    The defeat at Majuba Hill was followed by the complete surrender of the  Gladstonian Government, an act which was either the most pusillanimous  or the most magnanimous in recent history. It is hard for the big man  to draw away from the small before blows are struck but when the big man  has been knocked down three times it is harder still. An overwhelming  British force was in the field, and the General declared that he held  the enemy in the hollow of his hand. Our military calculations have been  falsified before now by these farmers, and it may be that the task  of Wood and Roberts would have been harder than they imagined; but on  paper, at least, it looked as if the enemy could be crushed without  difficulty. So the public thought, and yet they consented to the  upraised sword being stayed. With them, as apart from the politicians,  the motive was undoubtedly a moral and Christian one. They considered  that the annexation of the Transvaal had evidently been an injustice,  that the farmers had a right to the freedom for which they fought, and  that it was an unworthy thing for a great nation to continue an unjust  war for the sake of a military revenge. It was the height of idealism,  and the result has not been such as to encourage its repetition.    An armistice was concluded on March 5th, 1881, which led up to a peace  on the 23rd of the same month. The Government, after yielding to force  what it had repeatedly refused to friendly representations, made  a clumsy compromise in their settlement. A policy of idealism and  Christian morality should have been thorough if it were to be tried  at all. It was obvious that if the annexation were unjust, then the  Transvaal should have reverted to the condition in which it was before  the annexation, as defined by the Sand River Convention. But the  Government for some reason would not go so far as this. They niggled  and quibbled and bargained until the State was left as a curious hybrid  thing such as the world has never seen. It was a republic which was  part of the system of a monarchy, dealt with by the Colonial Office,  and included under the heading of 'Colonies' in the news columns of the  'Times.' It was autonomous, and yet subject to some vague suzerainty,  the limits of which no one has ever been able to define. Altogether, in  its provisions and in its omissions, the Convention of Pretoria appears  to prove that our political affairs were as badly conducted as our  military in this unfortunate year of 1881.    It was evident from the first that so illogical and contentious an  agreement could not possibly prove to be a final settlement, and indeed  the ink of the signatures was hardly dry before an agitation was on foot  for its revision. The Boers considered, and with justice, that if they  were to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30691"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science, December 1930 (#4)"],[1,"cure him.\"           *       *       *       *       *    In another moment, the still, half-dead body was lifted and gently  slipped into a compartment.    Before Hale's horrified gaze fastened on the eye-piece which revealed  moving pictures of every process that went on within, Unani Assu's body  was reduced almost instantly to a fine, silvery dust.    \"Good God!\" he cried. \"You have killed him.\"    The scientist's teeth showed in his wide smile. \"Think so? Does a woman  destroy a dress when she rips it up to make it over?\"    \"Do you mean me to understand that you can reduce a living body to its  basic elements and then rebuild these elements into a remade man?\"    \"Watch!\" warned the scientist.    Hale looked again and saw the silver dust that was once a living body  being whirled into a tiny, grublike thing. He saw the grub expand into  an embryo, and the embryo develop into a foetus. From now on the  development was slower, and he often stopped to talk with Sir Basil.    Once he asked: \"If this man had died naturally, could you have brought  him back to life?\"    Sir Basil shook his head. \"No. When once the mind-electron is completely  freed from its enslavement by matter, it is forever beyond recall by the  body it has just vacated. Like atomic electrons, whose equilibrium  disturbed break away from their planetary system and go dashing off into  space, only to be drawn into another planetary system, the mind-electron  may be enslaved almost immediately by extraneous matter. Had Unani Assu  died, his liberated mind-electron might at once have been captured by a  jungle flower going to seed. Immediately a new seed would be started.  And now the former Unani Assu would be a seed of a jungle flower, later  to find new life as a plant.\"    Suddenly the scientist threw up his hand and cried: \"You see? The Mind  will be eternally enslaved as long as there is life! Oh, for the time of  deliverance!\" He gazed fanatically into space, as though he dreamed  magnificently.    Hale observed him thoughtfully. When that great brain weakened, the  consequences would be frightful.           *       *       *       *       *    Sir Basil, as though he had made a sudden decision, went over to that  part of his machine which he called the molecule-disintegrator.    \"Oakham!\" he called out. \"I have taken you partly into my confidence.  Now I want to show you something. Come here.\"    Hale obeyed with misgivings. The scientist pointed out the window to a  group of Indians, anxious relatives of Unani Assu.    \"Watch!\" he ordered.    Turning one of the projectors on the machine toward the window, he  sighted carefully and pressed a button.    Immediately one of the Indians fell to the ground and struggled. His  companions began dancing around him in evident joy. Faintly to the  laboratory came a familiar chant, which Hale recognized as Ana's death  song.        Dust to dust      Mind to Mind--      He will shed his body      As the green snake sheds his skin.    As Hale watched, the struggling Indian's body seemed to shrink, and  then, instantly, it disappeared.    \"Watch them scatter the dust!\" said the scientist.    One of the Indians stooped and blew upon the grass.    \"What have you done!\" Hale gasped. \"You've killed this one. Oh, I see  now! These poor devils are totally ignorant that you are killing them  for practice. They worship you while you turn them to--silver dust!\" He  turned angrily on the scientist as though he longed to strike him.    \"Keep cool, young man!\" Sir Basil held up his fleshless hand. \"There is  no death! Change, yes; but no permanent blotting out of consciousness.  Can't you see the horror of it as nature works? When your time for  release comes, as it inevitably will, your mind-electron might find new  enslavement in a worm!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hale's reply came hotly. \"If that is true, why do you murder these poor  devils deliberately!\"    \"My dear Oakham, perhaps you are not so brilliant as I had hoped! All  that I have done thus far is only child's play, in preparation for my  real work. Haven't you guessed by now what I am getting ready to do?\"    \"No; I'm a poor guesser.\"    The scientist made a gesture of mock despair. \"Then let me tell you. The  molecule-disintegrator is active only on organic structures. When I  concentrate it so\"--he reached out again, sighted the projector on some  point beyond the window and pressed a button--\"one single living  organism passes out. See that jupati tree by the rock disappear?\"    Before Hale's eyes, the tall, slender tree melted into air.    \"But,\" continued Sir Basil, \"if I should _broadcast_ my  molecule-disintegrator on electron magnetic waves, destruction would  pass out in all directions, following the curve of the earth's surface,  penetrating earth, air, water.\" He wet his lips carefully. \"You  understand?\"    Hale stiffened suddenly. \"I understand. No life could survive these  vibrations of destruction? Through every corner of the earth where life  lurks, they would reach?\"    \"Yes!\" cried Sir Basil. \"There would be not a blade of grass, not a  living spore, not a hidden egg! Think of it, Oakham! No more would the  clean air and the sweet earth reek with life, and at last the ultimate  mind-electron would be released forever.\"    He was breathing fast, and his emaciated face burned with two red  spots.    Hale thought rapidly. He was convinced now that the fate of all life lay  within that diabolical network of chemical apparatus.    At last he said: \"And what of you and I, Sir Basil? Shall we, too, be  caught in this wholesale destruction?\"    \"Not immediately,\" replied the scientist. \"Of course, I want to  remain in the flesh long enough to be sure that my purpose has been  accomplished. I have provided a way for my own safety. If you desire,  you may remain with me.\" He smiled craftily. \"I have planned to keep  Ana also, the woman whom I called into life and made as I wished.\"           *       *       *       *       *    His words pounded against Hale's tortured ears with almost physical  force. With a supreme effort, the young man controlled his rage and  despair. Ana needed him too much now for him to risk defeat by showing  his emotions.    To Sir Basil he said: \"But if all life disappears from the earth, what  shall we do for food--you, Ana, and I?\"    Sir Basil lifted his brows. \"You don't think I overlooked that, do you?  What is food? Various combinations of the basic elements. I who have  conquered the atom need never worry about starving to death.\"    All this time, the machinery had been humming, and now the humming  changed its note to a shrill whistle. Sir Basil went to the eye-piece  and looked into it. Opening a door in the machinery, he disappeared  inside. He came out soon, flushed and evidently elated.    \"Bring the stretcher, Oakham,\" he ordered.    Hale brought the stretcher, placing it close to the machine. Then Sir  Basil opened a metal door and gently eased out a human body.    It was Unani Assu, unconscious but alive and breathing. Hale, helping  the scientist to get the man on the stretcher, noticed that the crushed  legs were perfectly healed. Together they bore him to a long seat. The  Indian's eyes were still closed, but his even breathing indicated that  he was only sleeping.    Suddenly Hale pointed a finger and cried out. \"My God, Sir Basil, look  at his hands and feet!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Unani Assu, still lying like a recumbent bronze statue sculptured by a  master, was perfect from shoulder to wrist, from thigh to ankle. But,  somewhere in that diabolical machine through which he had passed, his  hands and feet had undergone a hideous metamorphism which had  transformed them from the well-formed extremities of a splendid young  Indian into the hairy paws of a giant rat!    Hale turned away his head, sick with disgust.    Sir Basil cut the silence triumphantly:    \"Now he'll never again face Ana with love in his eyes!\"    \"What!\" broke in Hale. \"Did you plan this monstrous thing?\"    \"Of course! I told you I should forever cure him of his mad  infatuation.\"    \"But why didn't you kill him, as you killed the others? It would have  been the most merciful way.\"    Sir Basil showed his teeth in his ugly smile. \"A creator is never  merciful.\"    A quiver passed through the Indian's body and presently, he sighed  deeply and opened his eyes. He seemed dazed, puzzled. He looked from  Hale to the scientist, and turned seeking eyes to other parts of the  laboratory.    \"Ana!\" he called weakly. \"Where is Ana?\"    He pulled himself a little unsteadily to his feet--to the spatulated,  hairy _rodent_ feet that had come out of the life-machine. Staggering,  he would have fallen, had he not thrown out his arm to steady himself.  Instinctively he tried to grasp something for support, and then, for the  first time, he discovered his deformity.           *       *       *       *       *    Hale was never to forget that expression of horror and disgust that  swept over the Indian's face as he spread open his revolting extremities  and stared at them.    A sudden, wild roar of despair rang through the room. \"Aimu! My hands!\"    The scientist smiled with evident amusement. \"You are a grotesque sight,  Unani Assu. Do you want to see Ana now?\"    The fright and horror faded from the Indian's face, for now he glared  with hate into the mad, mocking eyes.    \"You did it!\" the Indian ground out. \"You've made me into a thing from  which Ana will run screaming.\"    Through the quiet rage of the perfectly spoken English ran a thread of  sorrow. \"Aimu, whom we considered too holy to name!\"    Choking, he hobbled away to the door, which he unbolted. As he passed  out into the open, Sir Basil went over to the machine and began sighting  the projector which cast forth the ray of destruction.    \"No!\" cried Hale. \"You've done enough murder for to-day.\"    The scientist paused. \"I"]]]
