Guy wires, shown in the figure, are applied so as to stiffen the  whole apparatus. A board with a screw eye at each end may be pivoted to  the upright, as in Fig. 6, for measuring altitudes; or to the box, as in  Fig. 7, for observing the time at which a star in its diurnal motion  passes through the plane determined by the plumb line and the center of  the screw eye through which the observer looks.    The whole apparatus may be constructed by any person of ordinary  mechanical skill at a very small cost, and it or something equivalent  should be provided for every class beginning observational astronomy. To  use the apparatus for the experiment of § 10, it should be leveled, and  the board with the screw eyes, attached as in Fig. 7, should be turned  until the observer, looking through the screw eye, sees Polaris exactly  behind the wire. Use a bicycle lamp to illumine the wire by night. The  apparatus is now adjusted, and the observer has only to wait for the  stars which he desires to observe, and to note by his watch the time at  which they pass behind the wire. It will be seen that the wire takes the  place of the vertical edge of the building, and that the board with the  screw eyes is introduced solely to keep the observer in the right place  relative to the wire.    12. A SIDEREAL CLOCK.--Clocks are sometimes so made and regulated that  they show always the same hour and minute when the stars come back to  the same place, and such a timepiece is called a sidereal clock--i. e.,  a star-time clock. Would such a clock gain or lose in comparison with an  ordinary watch? Could an ordinary watch be turned into a sidereal watch  by moving the regulator?    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Photographing the circumpolar stars.--BARNARD.]    13. PHOTOGRAPHING THE STARS.--EXERCISE 7.--For any student who uses a  camera. Upon some clear and moonless night point the camera, properly  focused, at Polaris, and expose a plate for three or four hours. Upon  developing the plate you should find a series of circular trails such as  are shown in Fig. 8, only longer. Each one of these is produced by a  star moving slowly over the plate, in consequence of its changing  position in the sky. The center indicated by these curved trails is  called the pole of the heavens. It is that part of the sky toward which  is pointed the axis about which the earth rotates, and the motion of the  stars around the center is only an apparent motion due to the rotation  of the earth which daily carries the observer and his camera around this  axis while the stars stand still, just as trees and fences and telegraph  poles stand still, although to the passenger upon a railway train they  appear to be in rapid motion. So far as simple observations are  concerned, there is no method by which the pupil can tell for himself  that the motion of the stars is an apparent rather than a real one, and,  following the custom of astronomers, we shall habitually speak as if it  were a real movement of the stars. How long was the plate exposed in  photographing Fig. 8?    14. FINDING THE STARS.--On Plate I, opposite page 124, the pole of the  heavens is at the center of the map, near Polaris, and the heavy trail  near the center of Fig. 8 is made by Polaris. See if you can identify  from the map any of the stars whose trails show in the photograph. The  brighter the star the bolder and heavier its trail.    Find from the map and locate in the sky the two bright stars Capella and  Vega, which are on opposite sides of Polaris and nearly equidistant from  it. Do these stars share in the motion around the pole? Are they visible  on every clear night, and all night?    Observe other bright stars farther from Polaris than are Vega and  Capella and note their movement. Do they move like the sun and moon? Do  they rise and set?    In what part of the sky do the stars move most rapidly, near the pole or  far from it?    How long does it take the fastest moving stars to make the circuit of  the sky and come back to the same place? How long does it take the slow  stars?    15. RISING AND SETTING OF THE STARS.--A study of the sky along the lines  indicated in these questions will show that there is a considerable part  of it surrounding the pole whose stars are visible on every clear night.  The same star is sometimes high in the sky, sometimes low, sometimes to  the east of the pole and at other times west of it, but is always above  the horizon. Such stars are said to be circumpolar. A little farther  from the pole each star, when at the lowest point of its circular path,  dips for a time below the horizon and is lost to view, and the farther  it is away from the pole the longer does it remain invisible, until, in  the case of stars 90° away from the pole, we find them hidden below the  horizon for twelve hours out of every twenty-four (see Fig. 9). The sun  is such a star, and in its rising and setting acts precisely as does  every other star at a similar distance from the pole--only, as we shall  find later, each star keeps always at (nearly) the same distance from  the pole, while the sun in the course of a year changes its distance  from the pole very greatly, and thus changes the amount of time it  spends above and below the horizon, producing in this way the long days  of summer and the short ones of winter.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Diurnal motion of the northern constellations.]    How much time do stars which are more than 90° from the pole spend above  the horizon?    We say in common speech that the sun rises in the east, but this is  strictly true only at the time when it is 90° distant from the  pole--i. e., in March and September. At other seasons it rises north or  south of east according as its distance from the pole is less or greater  than 90°, and the same is true for the stars.    16. THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE SKY.--Find from a map the latitude and  longitude of your schoolhouse. Find on the map the place whose latitude  is 39° and longitude 77° west of the meridian of Greenwich. Is there any  other place in the world which has the same latitude and longitude as  your schoolhouse?    The places of the stars in the sky are located in exactly the manner  which is illustrated by these geographical questions, only different  names are used. Instead of latitude the astronomer says _declination_,  in place of longitude he says _right ascension_, in place of meridian he  says _hour circle_, but he means by these new names the same ideas that  the geographer expresses by the old ones.    Imagine the earth swollen up until it fills the whole sky; the earth's  equator would meet the sky along a line (a great circle) everywhere 90°  distant from the pole, and this line is called the _celestial equator_.  Trace its position along the middle of the map opposite page 190 and  notice near what stars it runs. Every meridian of the swollen earth  would touch the sky along an hour circle--i. e., a great circle passing  through the pole and therefore perpendicular to the equator. Note that  in the map one of these hour circles is marked 0. It plays the same part  in measuring right ascensions as does the meridian of Greenwich in  measuring longitudes; it is the beginning, from which they are reckoned.  Note also, at the extreme left end of the map, the four bright stars in  the form of a square, one side of which is parallel and close to the  hour circle, which is marked 0. This is familiarly called the Great  Square in Pegasus, and may be found high up in the southern sky whenever  the Big Dipper lies below the pole. Why can it not be seen when Ursa  Major is above the pole?    Astronomers use the right ascensions of the stars not only to tell in  what part of the sky the star is placed, but also in time reckonings, to  regulate their sidereal clocks, and with regard to this use they find  it convenient to express right ascension not in degrees but in hours,  24 of which fill up the circuit of the sky and each of which is equal  to 15° of arc, 24 × 15 = 360. The right ascension of Capella is  5h. 9m. = 77.2°, but the student should accustom himself to using it  in hours and minutes as given and not to change it into degrees. He  should also note that some stars lie on the side of the celestial  equator toward Polaris, and others are on the opposite side, so that the  astronomer has to distinguish between north declinations and south  declinations, just as the geographer distinguishes between north  latitudes and south latitudes. This is done by the use of the + and -  signs, a + denoting that the star lies north of the celestial equator,  i. e., toward Polaris.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--From a photograph of the Pleiades.]    Find on Plate II, opposite page 190, the Pleiades (Pl[=e]ad[=e]s),  R. A. = 3h. 42m., Dec. = +23.8°. Why do they not show on Plate I,  opposite page 124? In what direction are they from Polaris? This is one  of the finest star clusters in the sky, but it needs a telescope to  bring out its richness. See how many stars you can count in it with the  naked eye, and afterward examine it with an opera glass. Compare what  you see with Fig. 10. Find Antares, R. A. = 16h. 23m. Dec. = -26.2°. How  far is it, in degrees, from the pole? Is it visible in your sky? If so,  what is its color?    Find the R. A. and Dec. of [a] Ursæ Majoris; of [b] Ursæ Majoris; of  Polaris. Find the Northern Crown, _Corona Borealis_, R. A. = 15h. 30m.,  Dec. = +27.0°; the Beehive, _Præsepe_, R. A. = 8h. 33m., Dec. = +20.4°.    These should be looked up, not only on the map, but also in the sky.    17. REFERENCE LINES AND CIRCLES.--As the stars move across the sky in  their diurnal motion, they carry the framework of hour circles and  equator with them, so that the right ascension and declination of each  star remain unchanged by this motion, just as longitudes and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34848"],[0,"Mammals of the San Gabriel Mountains of California (#4)"],[1,"the Pacific face of Blue Ridge at 7000 feet elevation  often grow in association with scrub oak and mountain-mahogany.    Few mammals are resident in the typical yellow pine forest as  characterized by dense coniferous timber and little herbaceous or brushy  growth. Here most of the species recorded actually find optimal  conditions in an adjacent habitat. The forest probably harbors surplus  individuals from adjacent preferred habitats, or, as in the case of  chipmunks and ground squirrels, the forest often serves as forage ground  while nearby brushy areas are utilized for breeding and shelter. The  abundance of birds in the timber contrasts strikingly with the paucity  of mammals there. The lack of a seed-producing understory, and the open  duff-covered stretches of ground on which rodents would be extremely  vulnerable to predation, probably in part account for the scarcity of  rodents.    Within the general area encompassed by the yellow pine forest there are  two major habitats, namely coniferous forest and chaparral. The  species of plants comprising the chaparral of the Transition Life-zone  are different from those comprising the chaparral of the Upper Sonoran  Life-zone on the Pacific slope. In the chaparral of the Transition  Life-zone, basin sagebrush and snowbrush grow in extensive patches in  clearings in the timber. Dense thickets of choke cherry cover many damp  hollows, and these thickets harbor the houses of _Neotoma fuscipes_. The  food and shelter afforded by these chaparral areas importantly influence  the local distribution of rodents: for example, _Dipodomys agilis_ and  _Perognathus californicus_ in the yellow pine area are found only in  association with chaparral, being completely absent from wooded areas.    The severe winter weather in this association must force many of the  mammals into periods of inactivity. Probably during the long periods in  the winter when snow covers the ground the heteromyids and sciurids  remain below ground.      Pinyon-Juniper Woodland Association    MAJOR PLANTS    _Pinus monophylla_  _Juniperus californica_  _Quercus dumosa var. turbinella_  _Purshia glandulosa_  _Fremontia californica_  _Cercocarpus ledifolius_  _Yucca Whipplei_    In the San Gabriel Mountains this association is limited to the desert  slope and reaches its lower limit at the bases of the foothills and  extends up to the lower edge of the yellow pine forests. The altitudinal  extent of the pinyon-juniper association is from roughly 4000 to 6000  feet elevation.    Several habitats are evident within the pinyon-juniper belt. On north  slopes in the upper part of this association, scattered stands of pinyon  pines are found with dense patches of scrub oak intervening, while on  other such slopes a dense chaparral is present, consisting primarily of  scrub oak, mountain-mahogany, and California slippery-elm. In this type  of chaparral several hundred trap nights yielded only two rodent  species: _Neotoma fuscipes simplex_ and _Peromyscus truei montipinoris_.  There are few pinyons on the south slopes, especially in the lower parts  of the association; many of these slopes are clothed with an open growth  of manzanita and yucca, while northern exposures there support mostly  scrub oak. Many of the flats of the pinyon belt are grown to basin  sagebrush.    Following is a list of the mammals taken in about 400 trap nights at one  locality in the pinyon-juniper association. The area supported a mixed  growth of pinyon, scrub oak, mountain-mahogany, and antelope-brush,  together with smaller brushy plants, and was at the head of Grandview  Canyon, at an altitude of roughly 5000 feet.

Because the  mammalian populations of the pinyon belt and the juniper belt are  somewhat different, the mammals of these areas are most conveniently  taken up separately.    In the juniper belt the juniper tree is of marked ecologic significance;  the distribution of _Peromyscus truei_ and _Neotoma fuscipes_ is  determined here by the presence of junipers. At certain times of year  the fruit of this plant is eaten by coyotes, kangaroo rats, and wood  rats.    The list below indicates the results of approximately 500 trap nights in  the juniper belt near Mescal Canyon, between 4000 and 5000 feet  elevation.

Because the washes are in the same geographic area  as the juniper belt they are discussed together. These washes on desert  slopes are densely populated by rodents derived from adjacent areas, and  support vegetation typical of higher floral belts in association with  xerophytic, typically desert, species. In a sense, the washes serve to  mix up the mammals of adjacent areas. For example, _Onychomys torridus  pulcher_ and _Peromyscus eremicus eremicus_, which are mammals typical  of the desert, were found in Mescal Wash above their usual desert range;  and _Peromyscus californicus insignis_ and _Peromyscus boylii rowleyi_,  which are chaparral inhabiting mammals, were found in the wash far  removed from their chaparral environment. Washes are evidently effective  agents in facilitating the dispersal of certain species of mammals. It  is easy to envision a species crossing "]]]
