As soon as everybody was out of sight he flew swiftly to his soldiers  and cried, \"Come on; they're all in the church.\"    Then they all crept quickly but quietly to the church, and while some  piled wood about the door, others applied fire.    The wood caught readily, and the fire was burning fiercely before the  kites were aware of their danger; but when the church began to fill  with smoke, and tongues of flame shot through the cracks, they tried  to escape through the windows. The greater part of them, however,  were suffocated, or, having their wings singed, could not fly away,  and so were burned to death, among them their sultan, Mwayway; and  Koongooroo and his crows got their old town back again.    From that day to this the kites fly away from the crows.                V.    GOSO, THE TEACHER.      Once there was a man named Go'so, who taught children to read,  not in a schoolhouse, but under a calabash tree. One evening, while  Goso was sitting under the tree deep in the study of the next day's  lessons, Paa, the gazelle, climbed up the tree very quietly to steal  some fruit, and in so doing shook off a calabash, which, in falling,  struck the teacher on the head and killed him.    When his scholars came in the morning and found their teacher lying  dead, they were filled with grief; so, after giving him a decent  burial, they agreed among themselves to find the one who had killed  Goso, and put him to death.    After talking the matter over they came to the conclusion that the  south wind was the offender.    So they caught the south wind and beat it.    But the south wind cried: \"Here! I am Koo'see, the south wind. Why  are you beating me? What have I done?\"    And they said: \"Yes, we know you are Koosee; it was you who threw  down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have  done it.\"    But Koosee said, \"If I were so powerful would I be stopped by a  mud wall?\"    So they went to the mud wall and beat it.    But the mud wall cried: \"Here! I am Keeyambaa'za, the mud wall. Why  are you beating me? What have I done?\"    And they said: \"Yes, we know you are Keeyambaaza; it was you who  stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw  down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have  done it.\"    But Keeyambaaza said, \"If I were so powerful would I be bored through  by the rat?\"    So they went and caught the rat and beat it.    But the rat cried: \"Here! I am Paan'ya, the rat. Why are you beating  me? What have I done?\"    And they said: \"Yes, we know you are Paanya; it was you who bored  through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south  wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck  our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.\"    But Paanya said, \"If I were so powerful would I be eaten by a cat?\"    So they hunted for the cat, caught it, and beat it.    But the cat cried: \"Here! I am Paa'ka, the cat. Why do you beat  me? What have I done?\"    And they said: \"Yes, we know you are Paaka; it is you that eats Paanya,  the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped  Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the  calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.\"    But Paaka said, \"If I were so powerful would I be tied by a rope?\"    So they took the rope and beat it.    But the rope cried: \"Here! I am Kaam'ba, the rope. Why do you beat  me? What have I done?\"    And they said: \"Yes, we know you are Kaamba; it is you that ties Paaka,  the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza,  the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the  south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You  should not have done it.\"    But Kaamba said, \"If I were so powerful would I be cut by a knife?\"    So they took the knife and beat it.    But the knife cried: \"Here! I am Kee'soo, the knife. Why do you beat  me? What have I done?\"    And they said: \"Yes, we know you are Keesoo; you cut Kaamba, the rope;  that ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through  Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind;  and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our  teacher Goso. You should not have done it.\"    But Keesoo said, \"If I were so powerful would I be burned by the fire?\"    And they went and beat the fire.    But the fire cried: \"Here! I am Mo'to, the fire. Why do you beat  me? What have I done?\"    And they said: \"Yes, we know you are Moto; you burn Keesoo, the knife;  that cuts Kaamba, the rope; that ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya,  the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped  Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the  calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.\"    But Moto said, \"If I were so powerful would I be put out by water?\"    And they went to the water and beat it.    But the water cried: \"Here! I am Maa'jee, the water. Why do you beat  me? What have I done?\"    And they said: \"Yes, we know you are Maajee; you put out Moto, the  fire; that burns Keesoo, the knife; that cuts Kaamba, the rope; that  ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through  Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind;  and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our  teacher Goso. You should not have done it.\"    But Maajee said, \"If I were so powerful would I be drunk by the ox?\"    And they went to the ox and beat it.    But the ox cried: \"Here! I am Ng'om'bay, the ox. Why do you beat  me? What have I done?\"    And they said: \"Yes, we know you are Ng'ombay; you drink Maajee, the  water; that puts out Moto, the fire; that burns Keesoo, the knife;  that cuts Kaamba, the rope; that ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya,  the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped  Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the  calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.\"    But Ng'ombay said, \"If I were so powerful would I be tormented by  the fly?\"    And they caught a fly and beat it.    But the fly cried: \"Here! I am Een'zee, the fly. Why do you beat  me? What have I done?\"    And they said: \"Yes, we know you are Eenzee; you torment Ng'ombay, the  ox; who drinks Maajee, the water; that puts out Moto, the fire; that  burns Keesoo, the knife; that cuts Kaamba, the rope; that ties Paaka,  the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza,  the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the  south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You  should not have done it.\"    But Eenzee said, \"If I were so powerful would I be eaten by the  gazelle?\"    And they searched for the gazelle, and when they found it they beat it.    But the gazelle said: \"Here! I am Paa, the gazelle. Why do you beat  me? What have I done?\"    And they said: \"Yes, we know you are Paa; you eat Eenzee, the fly;  that torments Ng'ombay, the ox; who drinks Maajee, the water; that  puts out Moto, the fire; that burns Keesoo, the knife; that cuts  Kaamba, the rope; that ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat;  who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee,  the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash  that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.\"    The gazelle, through surprise at being found out and fear of the  consequences of his accidental killing of the teacher, while engaged  in stealing, was struck dumb.    Then the scholars said: \"Ah! he hasn't a word to say for himself. This  is the fellow who threw down the calabash that struck our teacher  Goso. We will kill him.\"    So they killed Paa, the gazelle, and avenged the death of their  teacher.                VI.    THE APE, THE SNAKE, AND THE LION.      Long, long ago there lived, in a village called Keejee'jee, a woman  whose husband died, leaving her with a little baby boy. She worked  hard all day to get food for herself and child, but they lived very  poorly and were most of the time half-starved.    When the boy, whose name was 'Mvoo' Laa'na, began to get big, he said  to his mother, one day: \"Mother, we are always hungry. What work did  my father do to support us?\"    His mother replied: \"Your father was a hunter. He set traps, and we  ate what he caught in them.\"    \"Oho!\" said 'Mvoo Laana; \"that's not work; that's fun. I, too, will  set traps, and see if we can't get enough to eat.\"    The next day he went into the forest and cut branches from the trees,  and returned home in the evening.    The second day he spent making the branches into traps.    The third day he twisted cocoanut fiber into ropes.    The fourth day he set up as many traps as time would permit.    The fifth day he set up the remainder of the traps.    The sixth day he went to examine the traps, and they had caught so  much game, beside what they needed for themselves, that he took a  great quantity to the big town of Oongoo'ja, where he sold it and  bought corn and other things, and the house was full of food; and, as  this good fortune continued, he and his mother lived very comfortably.    But after a while, when he went to his traps he found nothing in them  day after day.    One morning, however, he found that an ape had been caught in one of  the traps, and he was about to kill it, when it said: \"Son of Adam,  I am Neea'nee, the ape; do not kill me.

And since this is so,--since the interest  in the overtones, the added value given by time, the value for  us, is not necessarily related to the value as literature of the  fundamental note,--to make the study of the overtones an  essential part of criticism is to be guilty of the Pathetic  Fallacy; that is, the falsification of the object by the  intrusion of ourselves,--the typical sentimental crime.    It seems to me, indeed, that instead of courting a sense for  the aromatic in literature, the critic should rather guard  himself against its insidious approaches.  Disporting himself  in such pleasures of the fancy, he finds it easy to believe,  and to make us believe, that a piece of literature gains in  intrinsic value from its power to stimulate his historical  sense.  The modern appreciative critic, in short, is too likely  to be the dupe of his \"sophisticated reverie,\"--like an epicure  who should not taste the meat for the sauces.  A master work,  once beautiful according to the great and general laws, never  becomes, properly speaking, either more or less so.  If a piece  of art can take us with its own beauty, there is no point in  superimposing upon it shades of sentiment; if it cannot so  charm, all the rose-colored lights of this kind of appreciative  criticism are unavailing.    The \"literary\" treatment of art, as the \"emotional\" treatment of literature,--for that is what \"appreciation\" and \"interpretation\"  really are,--can completely justify itself only as the crowning  touch of a detailed aesthetic analysis of those \"order of  impression distinct in kind\" which are the primary elements in  our pleasure in the beautiful.  It is the absence--and not only  the absence, but the ignoring of the possibility--of such  analysis which tempts one to rebel against such phrases as those  of Professor Gates:  \"the splendid and victorious womanhood of  Titian's Madonnas,\" \"the gentle and terrestrial grace of  motherhood in those of Andrea del Sarto,\" the \"sweetly ordered  comeliness of Van Dyck's.\"  One is moved to ask if the only  difference between a Madonna of Titian and one of Andrea is a  difference of temper, and if the important matter for the  critic of art is the moral conception rather than the visible  beauty.    I cannot think of anything for which I would exchange the  enchanting volumes of Walter Pater, and yet even he is not the  ideal aesthetic critic whose duties he made clear.  What he has  done is to give us the most exquisite and delicate of  interpretations.  He has not failed to \"disengage\" the subtle  and peculiar pleasure that each picture, each poem or  personality, has in store for us; but of analysis and explanation  of this pleasure--of which he speaks in the Introduction to \"The  Renaissance\"--there is no more.  In the first lines of his paper  on Botticelli, the author asks, \"What is the peculiar sensation  which his work has the property of exciting in us?\"  And to  what does he finally come?  \"The peculiar character of Botticelli  is the result of a blending in him of a sympathy for humanity  in its uncertain conditions...with his consciousness of the  shadow upon it of the great things from which it sinks.\"  But  this is not aesthetic analysis!  It is not even the record of  a \"peculiar sensation,\" but a complex intellectual interpretation.  Where is the pleasure in the irrepressible outline, fascinating  in its falseness,--in the strange color, like the taste of  olives, of the Spring and the Pallas?  So, also, his great  passage on the Mona Lisa, his \"Winckelmann,\" even his \"Giorgione\"  itself, are merely wonderful delineations of the mood of  response to the creations of the art in question.  Such  interpretation as we have from Pater is a priceless treasure,  but it is none the less the final cornice, and not the corner  stone of aesthetic criticism.    The tendency to interpretation without any basis in aesthetic  explanation is especially seen in the subject of our original  discussion,--literature.  It is indeed remarkable how scanty  is the space given in contemporary criticism to the study of  an author's means to those results which we ourselves  experience.  Does no one really care how it is done?  Or are  they all in the secret, and interested only in the temperament  expressed or the aspect of life envisaged in a given work?  One would have thought that as the painter turned critic in  Fromentin at least to a certain extent sought out and dealt  with the hidden workings of his art, so the romancer or the  poet-critic might also have told off for us \"the very pulse  of the machine.\"  The last word has not been said on the  mysteries of the writer's art.  We know, it may be, how the  links of Shakespeare's magic chain of words are forged, but  the same cannot be said of any other poet.  We have studied  Dante's philosophy and his ideal of love; but have we found  out the secrets of his \"inventive handling of rhythmical  language\"?  If Flaubert is univerally acknowledged to have  created a masterpiece in \"Madame Bovary,\" should there not  be an interest for criticism in following out, chapter by  chapter, paragraph by paragraph, word by word, the meaning  of what it is to be a masterpiece?  But such seems not to  be the case.  Taine reconstructs the English temperament out  of Fielding and Dickens; Matthew Arnold, although he deals  more than others in first principles, never carries his  analysis beyond the widest generalizations, like the  requirement for \"profound truth\" and \"high seriousness,\"  for great poetry.  And as we run the gamut of contemporary  criticism, we find ever preoccupation with the personality  of the writers and the ideas of their books.  I recall only  one example--the critical essays of Henry James--where the  craftsman has dropped some hints on the ideals of the  literary art; and even that, if I maybe allowed the bull,  in his novels rather than in his essays, for in critical  theory he is the most ardent of impressionists.  Whatever  the cause, we cannot but allow the dearth of knowledge of,  and interest in, the peculiar subject-matter of criticism,--  the elements of beauty in a work of literature.    But although the present body of criticism consists rather  of preliminaries and supplements to what should be its real  accomplishment, these should not therefore receive the less  regard.  The impressionist has set himself a definite task,  and he has succeeded.  If not the true critic, he is an  artist in his own right, and he has something to say to the  world.  The scientific critic has taken all knowledge for his  province; and although we hold that it has rushed in upon and  swamped his distinctly critical function, so long as we may  call him by his other name of natural historian of literature,  we can only acknowledge his great achievements.  For the  appreciative critic we have less sympathy as yet, but the  \"development of the luxurious intricacy and the manifold  implications of our enjoyment\" may fully crown the edifice of  aesthetic explanation and appraisal of the art of every age.  But all these, we feel, do not fulfill the essential function;  the Idea of Criticism is not here.  What the idea of criticism  is we have tried to work out:  a judgment of a work of art on  the basis of the laws of beauty.  That such laws there are,  that they exist directly in the relation between the material  form and the suggested physical reactions, and that they are  practically changeless, even as the human instincts are  changeless, we have sought to show.  And if there can be a  science of the beautiful, then an objective judgment on the  basis of the laws of the beautiful can be rendered.  The true  end of criticism, therefore, is to tell us whence and why the  charm of a work of art:  to disengage, to explain, to measure,  and to certify it.  And this explanation of charm, and this  stamping it with the seal of approval, is possible by the help,  and only by the help, of the science of aesthetics,--a science  now only in its beginning, but greatly to be desired in its  full development.    How greatly to be desired we realize in divining that the  present dearth of constructive and destructive criticism, of  all, indeed, except interpretations and reports, is responsible  for the modern mountains of machine-made literature.  Will not  the aesthetic critic be for us a new Hercules, to clear away  the ever growing heap of formless things in book covers?  If  he will teach us only what great art means in literature; if  he will give us never so little discussion of the first  principles of beauty, and point the moral with some \"selling  books,\" he will at least have turned the flood.  There are  stories nowadays, but few novels, and plenty of spectacles,  but no plays; and how should we know the difference, never  having heard what a novel ought to be?  But let the aesthetic  critic give us a firm foundation for criticism, a real  understanding of the conditions of literary art; let him teach  us to know a novel or a play when we see it, and we shall not  always mingle the wheat and the chaff.      II  THE NATURE OF BEAUTY      II  THE NATURE OF BEAUTY    EVERY introduction to the problems of aesthetics begins by  acknowledging the existence and claims of two methods of  attack,--the general, philosophical, deductive, which starts  from a complete metaphysics and installs beauty in its place  among the other great concepts; and the empirical, or inductive,  which seeks to disengage a general principle of beauty from  the objects of aesthetic experience and the facts of aesthetic  enjoyment: Fechner's \"aesthetics from above and from below.\"    The first was the method of aesthetics par excellence.  It was  indeed only through the desire of an eighteenth-century  philosopher,"]]]
