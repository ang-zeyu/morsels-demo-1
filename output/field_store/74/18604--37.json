Bull.,       26: 420, November 27, 1940.--Fifteen kilometers west of       Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico.         Fifteen km. W of Morelia (19); 11 km. SSE of Opopeo (12); 8       km. S of Patzcuaro; 24 km. S of Patzcuaro (2); Quiroga (20);       Tacicuaro (167).    Taylor and Smith (1945:530) presented data on 137 specimens collected at  Tacicuaro on October 1, 1939; these are all larvae and metamorphosing  individuals. Aside from these, the largest larva examined (UMMZ 104962  from 15 km. W of Morelia) has a snout-vent length of 70.0 mm. and a tail  length of 53.5 mm. The larvae are pale pinkish tan above and somewhat  paler below; there is a lateral row of cream colored spots. The  tail-fin, which is deepest at mid-length, extends to the back of the  head and is flecked with brown. In small larvae the outer edge of the  tail-fin is dark brown. The eyes are large. Two small metamorphosed  specimens (UMMZ 98967) from 24 kilometers south of Patzcuaro are  tentatively referred to this species. These specimens have body lengths  of 49.0 and 45.0 mm. and tail lengths of 36.0 and 31.5 mm.,  respectively. They have 17-17 and 16-15 vomerine teeth arranged in a  broad arch behind the choanae, 10 costal grooves, and 7 intercostal  spaces between adpressed toes. The dorsal color is uniform brown; that  of the venter is a dusty cream.    Larvae were collected from shallow ponds near Quiroga and 15 kilometers  west of Morelia; metamorphosed individuals were taken from beneath logs  in pine and fir forests at elevations from 2300 to 2800 meters.      ~Ambystoma dumerili dumerili~ (Duges)         _Siredon Dumerili_ Duges, La Naturaleza, 1:241, 1870--Lago       de Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Mexico.         _Bathysiredon dumerilii_, Dunn, Notulae Naturae, 36:1,       November 9, 1939.         _Bathysiredon dumerilii dumerilii_, Maldonado-Koerdell, Mem.       y Rev.

For many years this unusual salamander was known from only a few  specimens mostly collected in the last century; Smith and Taylor  (1948:7) stated: \"It is presumed that this species is extinct owing to  the introduction of exotic game and food fishes.\" In 1951 and in 1955 I  had been told that _axolotls_ were sold in the market at Patzcuaro;  nevertheless, none was found on my visits there. In 1956 Charles M.  Bogert obtained several large specimens at the market in Patzcuaro.  These establish the continued existence of the salamander in Lago de  Patzcuaro. On January 27, 1955, R. W. Dickerman procured a specimen (KU  41573) in the market at Morelia. Since fish are brought to Morelia from  Lago de Patzcuaro, the specimen probably was from that lake.  Nevertheless, the species may occur in other permanent bodies of water  in Michoacan. Maldonado-Koerdell (1948) described _Bathysiredon dumerili  queretarensis_ from San Juan del Rio, Queretaro. This locality is about  200 airline kilometers northeast of Lago de Patzcuaro and is in the Rio  Moctezuma drainage.      ~Ambystoma ordinarium~ Taylor         _Ambystoma ordinaria_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull.,       26:422, November 27, 1940.--Four miles west of El Mirador,       near Puerto Hondo, Michoacan, Mexico.         Axolotl (56); Cerro San Andres; 22 km. W of Mil Cumbres; 46       km. E of Morelia (34); 8 km. SE of Opopeo (5); Puerto de       Garnica (8); Puerto Hondo (41); San Gregorio (16); San Jose       de la Cumbre (20).    Of 16 specimens (KU 51520-35) collected on June 18, 1955, near San  Gregorio, 15 are adult females with swollen cloacae and minute ovarian  eggs. Possibly these specimens had just recently deposited their mature  eggs. In preservative the specimens are black above and dull creamy gray  below. Measurements for the 15 females are: snout-vent length,  80.0-102.0 (92.5); tail length, 69.0-93.0 (84.2); head width, 15.8-20.5  (17.7); head length, 22.8-26.6 (24.4). A larval specimen with small  gills has a snout-vent length of 72 mm. and a tail length of 62 mm.  Three specimens have 12 costal grooves; the other have 11.    Of 20 specimens from San Jose de la Cumbre (UMMZ 112857 and 115143), 14  are neotenic adults; the others are larvae. In life the salamanders were  blackish to olive-brown above with scattered cream-colored dots on the  dorsum and flanks but in preservative are dull grayish black with  indistinct pale spots and dark reticulations. The belly is pale gray  with indistinct dark spots. Eleven females and three males have the  following measurements, respectively: snout-vent length, 76.0-90.0  (80.7), 64.0-84.0 (74.3); tail length, 70.0-81.0 (75.0), 58.0-71.0  (66.7); head width, 19.5-23.5 (20.7), 17.5-20.5 (19.3); head length,  22.0-25.0 (23.0), 20.0-22.5 (21.5). The smallest larva has a snout-vent  length of 43.0 mm. and a tail length of 38.0 mm. Two individuals have 12  costal grooves; the others have 11. All of the females contained eggs,  the largest of which were 1.5 mm. in diameter. The stomachs of most of  the specimens were distended with oligochaets, aquatic insect larvae,  and small aquatic beetles.    A series of 34 larvae (JRD 5904-37) from 46 kilometers east of Morelia  are tentatively referred to this species. These specimens are  olive-brown above with cream-colored spots on the flanks; the dorsal  tail-fin does not extend onto the body.    This species has been found only at elevations in excess of 2400 meters  in pine and fir forests. At Rancho Axolotl James A. Peters collected  larvae and neotenic individuals in a rocky stream and adults from  beneath rocks and logs in the forest near the stream. Neotenic  individuals and larvae were found in a clear stream in pine-fir forest  at an elevation of 2700 meters near San Jose de la Cumbre; specimens  were collected there in July, 1955, and again in July, 1956. The site  was visited in April, 1956, at which time the stream consisted of only a  few puddles; no salamanders were found.      ~Ambystoma tigrinum velasci~ Duges         _Ambystoma velasci_ Duges, La Naturaleza, ser. 2, 1:142,       1888.--Laguna Santa Isabel, near Guadalupe Hidalgo, Distrito       Federal, Mexico.         _Ambystoma tigrinum velasci_, Dunn, Copeia, no. 3:157,       November 14, 1940.         Patzcuaro (5); Tacicuaro (9).    Definite specific assignment of these specimens, all larvae, cannot be  made at this time. They have shovel-shaped heads and laterally  compressed bodies with the dorsal tail-fin extending anteriorly to the  back of the head. The eyes are small. The body is pale tan with dark  mottling on the tail and flanks. The average snout-vent length for nine  specimens from Tacicuaro is 61.0 mm.    The larvae from Tacicuaro (UMMZ 89255) were collected by Dyfrig Forbes  in October, 1939; those from Patzcuaro, presumably Lago de Patzcuaro  (BMNH 1914.1.28-247-8 and CNHM 948), were collected by Hans Gadow and  Seth Meek in 1908.      ~Pseudoeurycea belli~ (Gray)         _Spelerpes belli_ Gray, Catalogue Batrachia Gradientia       British Museum, p. 46, 1850.--Mexico. Type locality       restricted to 2 miles east of Rio Frio, Puebla, Mexico, by       Smith and Taylor (1950a:341).         _Pseudoeurycea bellii_, Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull.,       30:209, June 12, 1944.         Axolotl (2); Carapan; Cerro Tancitaro (84); Macho de Agua;       22 km. W of Mil Cumbres; Opopeo; Patzcuaro (8); Puerto Hondo       (2): San Jose de la Cumbre; San Juan de Parangaricutiro       (42); Uruapan (5); Zacapu (4).    This salamander seems to reach its greatest abundance in Michoacan in  the Sierra de los Tarascos between Patzcuaro and Tancitaro, where it is  found at elevations from 1500 to 2900 meters. It is found less commonly  in the eastern part of the Cordillera Volcanica in Michoacan, where it  sometimes occurs in association with _Pseudoeurycea robertsi_.    On June 22 and 23, 1955, four clutches of eggs of this species were  found beneath adobe bricks and rocks on the volcanic ash that has buried  the village of San Juan de Parangaricutiro. The eggs were unstalked and  separate, but adherent in clumps of three or four (Pl. 2, Fig. 1). The  outer membranes were covered with fine particles of ash. The ash beneath  the stones where the eggs were found was only slightly moist; one clump  of eggs was partially desiccated. Three complete clutches have 20, 23,  and 34 eggs; one clutch of 15 eggs was being eaten by beetles  (Tenebrionidae: _Eleodes_ sp.). The eggs vary in size from 4.6 to 6.5  mm. and average 5.3 mm. in diameter. They are unpigmented. Surrounding  the embryo is a vitelline membrane, an inner, and an outer envelope  (Fig. 1). In an average-sized egg having an embryo 4 mm. in length, the  diameter of the outer membrane is 5.3 mm., the inner membrane 5.0 mm.,  and the vitelline membrane 4.6 mm. All of the eggs contained embryos in  which the limb buds were developed; in about half of these the eyes were  distinctly visible.    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Diagram of an egg of _Pseudoeurycea belli_ from  San Juan de Parangaricutiro, Michoacan. x 10.]    The first heavy rain of the season occurred on the night of June 22,  1955. Thus, at least sometimes, _Pseudoeurycea belli_ lays its eggs  before the onset of the rainy season. A female having a snout-vent  length of 110 mm., collected on June 22, 1955, contained 36 ovarian eggs  having diameters from 3.0 to 3.5 mm. The fact that small juveniles were  collected on the same date indicates that this salamander lays eggs over  a period of several weeks in late spring and early summer.    The smallest juvenile examined has a snout-vent length of 17.0 mm. and a  tail length of 7.5 mm. Twelve juveniles from the vicinity of San Juan de  Parangaricutiro have an average snout-vent length of 19.4 mm. and an  average tail length of 9.7 mm.

Crabb observed that about farmyards and farm buildings  where the skunks had been eliminated by persistent persecution, rats  were abundant, but that about others where the skunks were present, the  rats were scarce or absent. On several occasions he noted that heavy  populations of rats about farm buildings in summer and autumn nearly  disappeared in winter if a skunk was in residence.    Sign of spotted skunk was noted frequently on various parts of the  Reservation, especially along the hilltop ledges which were the best  woodrat habitat. On several occasions skunks released from live-traps  took shelter in woodrat houses which appeared to be unoccupied.  According to a local fur dealer, C. W. Ogle, spotted skunks reached a  peak of abundance in Douglas County in the winter of 1947-1948, and many  pelts were brought in for sale then. The concentration of skunks may  have had detrimental effect on the population of woodrats, especially  when extremes of weather had already made conditions critical for them,  as in early March, 1948, and in January, 1949, when snow and sleet made  their usual food supply unavailable.    The long-tailed weasel is considered to be a potentially important enemy  of the woodrat. Weasels have been seen on the Reservation on only a few  occasions, but they may be more numerous than these records would  indicate. Two were caught at the hilltop outcrop, at different times and  places, in funnel traps put out to catch snakes. The weasel seems to  prefer this rocky habitat, which is also favored by the woodrat. Because  of its ferocity and willingness to attack relatively large prey, and  because it is an agile climber and able to squeeze through any openings  large enough to accommodate a woodrat, it would seem to be a formidable  enemy.    The pilot black snake (_Elaphe obsoleta_) is an important enemy of this  woodrat on the Reservation and probably throughout the rat's geographic  range except for the extreme western part. Although this snake occurs in  every habitat of the Reservation, it has been found most often along  rock outcrops of wooded hilltop edges in the type of habitat most  favored by the rat. Most often pilot black snakes have attempted to  escape into crevices of the outcrop. These snakes are also skillful  climbers and often have escaped by climbing out of reach along branches  or even vertical tree trunks. On several occasions these snakes have  been found on or beside woodrat houses, or have escaped into them. Over  a seven-year period 143 pilot black snakes have been recorded, 53 of  which were adults.    On September, 1948, a large pilot black snake found basking on a rock  ledge, distended by a recent meal, was palped and contained a subadult  female woodrat. On June 19, 1953, one of us, approaching a live-trap set  under an overhanging rock ledge, saw a four-foot pilot black snake on  top of it. The snake struck repeatedly at the rat in this trap, but was  unable to reach it. At each stroke the rat would dash about the trap  frantically.    These snakes hunt by stealth, and might catch woodrats by entering their  nests, or by lying in wait along their runways, but are not quick enough  to catch them in actual pursuit. Young in the nest would seem to be  especially susceptible to predation by the pilot black snake. These  snakes hunt by active prowling, either by night or by day, and much of  their food consists of the helpless young of birds and mammals found in  the nests. While only well-grown or adult pilot black snakes would be  able to swallow an adult woodrat, any but first-year young probably  would be able to overcome and swallow the small young. The female  woodrat's habit of dragging the young attached to her teats as she flees  from the house at any alarm must save many litters from predation by the  pilot black snake. First litters of young, born in early March, are  already well grown, and past the age of greatest susceptibility to  predation before the snakes emerge from hibernation in late April or  early May.    The timber rattlesnake is another potentially destructive enemy, but on  the Reservation, and throughout much of its original range it is now  relatively scarce. The genus _Neotoma_ largely coincides in its over-all  distribution with the genus _Crotalus_, of the rattlesnakes. For most  kinds of woodrats, the larger species of rattlesnakes are among the  chief natural enemies.    The timber rattlesnake has habitat preferences similar to those of the  eastern woodrat. Of 30 timber rattlesnakes recorded on the Reservation  over an eight-year period, all but one were at or near hilltop rock  ledges in woodland. The woodrat is probably one of the most important  prey species for the timber rattlesnake. Like the woodrat, the  rattlesnake is mostly nocturnal in its activity. Unlike the pilot black  snake, it hunts by lying in wait, striking prey which comes within  range, and waiting for it to die from the venomous bite, rather than by  active prowling. Therefore, it is probably less of a hazard to young in  the nest than is the pilot black snake. Even young rattlesnakes too  small to eat woodrats are potentially dangerous to them, as they may  strike and kill any that come within range.      _Commensals_    Rainey (1956) listed many kinds of small animals that use the houses of  the eastern woodrat and live in more or less commensal relationships  with these rodents.    A situation unusually favorable for observing woodrats and their  associates was discovered on the Reservation where, in July, 1948, two  old strips of sheet metal, each covering an area of approximately 25  square feet, were used as shelter by a lactating female with three  young. This was on a brushy slope just below an old quarry site. A rock  pile and remains of an old rock wall were nearby. Woodrats had carried  many sticks back under the metal strips, filling the spaces beneath  their edges. There was a nest and a system of runways beneath the  strips. In the following seven years this site was seldom deserted for  long and was used by a succession of individuals. The strips of metal  could be easily raised and then lowered into place with little  disturbance. Because the situation was not entirely natural, the  findings may not be typical of other rat houses. Animals found over a  period of years beneath these metal strips include: several dozen each  of the ring-necked snake (_Diadophis punctatus_), five-lined skink  (_Eumeces fasciatus_), and ant-eating toad (_Gastrophryne olivacea_);  several individuals each of cottontail (_Sylvilagus floridanus_),  white-footed mouse (_Peromyscus leucopus_), short-tailed shrew (_Blarina  brevicauda_), least shrew (_Cryptotis parva_), American toad (_Bufo  americanus_), Great Plains skink (_Eumeces obsoletus_), pilot black  snake (_Elaphe obsoleta_); and one each of bull snake (_Pituophis  catenifer_), spotted king snake (_Lampropeltis calligaster_), red milk  snake (_L. triangulum_), and timber rattlesnake (_Crotalus horridus_).  The snakes which were potential predators on the rats seemed to be  merely utilizing the shelter in these instances, but they may have been  lying in wait for prey there.    Among mammals, the cottontail and the white-footed mouse are the most  persistent users of the woodrat houses, especially those that are no  longer occupied by the rats. On one occasion five white-footed mice were  caught simultaneously in a trap set beside a house at the base of an  osage orange tree. Subsequent trapping showed that this house was no  longer occupied by a rat, but that the mice lived in it. Occupancy of  such an old woodrat house by white-footed mice may continue long after  abandonment of the house by the rat, even after the house has partly  decayed and settled to a small part of its original volume.    Cottontails often have their forms under the edges of houses, either  occupied or deserted. These situations offer protection overhead and on  three sides. Abandoned houses having one or more of the entrance holes  enlarged, as by predators breaking through the side of the house to gain  access to the nest, are especially well adapted for occupancy by the  cottontail. The rabbit may make its form inside the house structure.    The opossum, also, finds the type of shelter that it requires in  abandoned houses that have had the entrances sufficiently enlarged. On  various occasions opossums or their remains have been found in such old  houses, and opossums released from live-traps have been known to seek  shelter in abandoned woodrat houses.    At the old quarry on the Reservation woodrat sign was especially  abundant. A wooden bin approximately seven feet square, used to store  crushed rock before quarrying operations were abandoned, was inhabited  by one rat. At the base of a rock crusher on the top of a bank a few  yards from the bin was an accumulation of sticks and other debris  brought by woodrats. A rock wall at the top of the bank between the  crusher and the bin had many crevices providing shelter for the rats,  and projecting rocks were littered with their droppings. In the spring  of 1949 the bin and rock crusher were removed, but at least one rat  continued to live in the rock wall. In the summer of 1951 several tons  of corn ruined in the flood were dumped on the top of the bank above the  wall. By autumn, Norway rats, either brought in with the corn or  attracted by it, had taken possession of the wall, evidently displacing  the woodrats, which were no longer present. Although this Old World  murid rat is much different from the woodrat in habits, it seemingly can  compete with it and replace it where habitat conditions are otherwise  favorable for both.      _Movements_    The woodrat is dependent on the stick houses that it constructs for  shelter.
