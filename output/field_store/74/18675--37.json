He, however, never returned home. He went to Spain  and obtained lucrative employment there, and the idea of writing a book  was abandoned. He would not have dared to publish the story of his first  voyage in a country where the truth was well known.    The statement made by Vespucci respecting his alleged first voyage is as  follows: He says that an expedition of discovery was sent by the King,  consisting of four ships, and that the King chose him to go with it. He  does not mention the name of the commander of the expedition, nor of  any of the captains or pilots; but he asserts that he was away eighteen  months, and that he discovered a great extent of mainland and an infinite  number of islands. The ships, he alleges, sailed from Cadiz on the 10th  of May 1497, and proceeded to Grand Canary, which he says is in 37 deg. 30'  N. lat., and 280 leagues from Lisbon. Thence they sailed for thirty-seven  days on a W.S.W. course, making 1,000 leagues, when they reached the coast  of the mainland in latitude 16 deg. N., and longitude from Canary 70 deg. W.    He describes the manners and customs of the people in considerable detail,  and enumerates the animals, giving a particular account of the _iguana_,  but without giving the animal a name. He also tells us that the native  names for their different kinds of food are _Yuca_, _Casabi_, and  _Ignami_; and that the word for a man of great wisdom is _Carabi_. He  describes a village with forty-four large huts built over the water on  poles, like a little Venice.    After sailing for eighty leagues along the coast he came to another  province, of which he gives the name. It is _Parias_ in the Latin version,  but in the Italian version _L_ has been substituted for _P_, and a _b_  for _s_, so that the word becomes _Lariab_. Then comes the audacious  assertion to which all this was leading. He says that he sailed along  the coast, always on a N.W. course, for 870 leagues. At the end of this  marvellous voyage he came to \"the finest harbour in the world\", where he  found a friendly people, and remained to refit for thirty-seven days. Here  the natives complained that they were subject to attacks from savage  people who came from islands at a distance of about 100 leagues to the  east. The Spaniards agreed to chastise the islanders, and after sailing  N.E. and E. for 100 leagues they came to islands where the natives were    called _Iti_. They had an encounter with them, in which one Spaniard  was killed and twenty-two were wounded. But they took 222 prisoners,  and sold them as slaves when they returned to Cadiz on October 15th, 1498.    Vespucci's account of the second voyage is that the expedition, consisting  of three ships, sailed from Cadiz on May 16th, 1499, and stopped some  days at the island of Fuoco. They then crossed the ocean after a voyage  of forty-four days, going over 500 leagues on a S.W. course. The landfall  was in 5 deg. S., and the country was inundated by the mouths of a great  river. They then steered north, and came to an excellent port formed by  a large island. He describes the chase of a canoe, manned by cannibal  people called _Cambali_; and the intercourse with inhabitants who told  them about the pearl fishery.    They next landed on an island, fifteen leagues from the land, where the  inhabitants, for want of water, chewed a green herb mixed with white  powder. Leaving this island, they came to another where the people were  so tall that it was named the _Island of the Giants_. They continued  to sail along the coast, having many encounters with the natives. They  found the latitude to be 15 deg. N., and here they came to a harbour for  repairing their ships, where the inhabitants were very friendly. They  remained forty-seven days, and collected many pearls. Departing from  this port, they shaped a course for _Antiglia_ (_Espanola_), where  they obtained supplies, remaining two months and seventeen days. Here,  he says, they endured many dangers and troubles from the same Christians  who were in this island with Columbus, and he believed this was caused  by envy. They left the island on the 22nd of July, and, after a voyage  of a month and a half, they returned to Cadiz on the 8th of September,  the year not given.    Las Casas, giving Vespucci credit for two voyages, seems to have thought  that he might have been with Hojeda again on his second voyage from  1502 to 1504. But Vespucci asserts that he was in Portugal, or serving  on board Portuguese ships, during the whole of that period.    The first voyage appears, both from internal and external evidence,  to be imaginary. The second voyage is the first of Hojeda inaccurately  told, while two or three incidents of the Hojeda voyage are transferred  to the imaginary first voyage. The assertion that the King sent an  expedition of discovery, consisting of four ships, in May 1497, is not  corroborated. There is no record of any such expedition, and there is  much collateral evidence, which will be discussed further on, that no  expedition was despatched by the King in that year. If such a royal  expedition had been despatched, with such marvellous results, Las Casas  could not have been ignorant of the fact. It has been suggested that four  out of twelve ships supplied to the King by Juanato Berardi might have  been used for this expedition, and that its despatch is not impossible,  because May 10th, 1497, the date of sailing given by Vespucci, is previous  to June 2nd, 1497, the date of the royal order cancelling permission  for private ships to go to the Indies. But the alleged expedition was  sent by the King, and was not a private one. It is more likely that  Vespucci purposely selected a date previous to June 2nd.    The voyage across the Atlantic to the mainland, in 16 deg. N., is described  by Vespucci as having been performed in thirty-seven days, with  a W.S.W. course, and a distance of 1,000 leagues. Such a course and  distance would have taken him to the Gulf of Paria, not to a coast in  latitude 16 deg. N. Even with a course direct to that point, and disregarding  the intervening land, the distance he gives would leave him 930 miles  short of the alleged position. No actual navigator would have made such a  blunder. He was quoting the reckoning from Hojeda's voyage, and invented  the latitude at random. When he came to his second voyage, to make a  difference, he halved the distance, saying that he was forty-four days  going 500 leagues on a S.W. course. He also gives 15 deg. as the latitude  of the coast discovered when he was with Hojeda, though no part of that  coast is north of 13 deg. His crowning statement that, starting from 23 deg.  N., he went 870 leagues along a coast always on a N.W. course, is still  more preposterous. Such a course and distance would have taken him right  across the continent of North America into British Columbia.    Varnhagen accepts the Florentine's latitudes, and assumes that when in  23 deg. N. he was near Tampico, on the coast of Mexico. But he rejects the  impossible courses and distances of Vespucci, substituting an imaginary  voyage of his own, by which he takes our contractor along the coast of  North America, round the peninsula of Florida, and up to Cape Hatteras,  where, he confesses, \"the finest harbour in the world\" is not to be  found. But such a voyage is a pure assumption, and as a serious argument  it is quite inadmissible. The evidence is the other way. The latitudes  are wrong, judging from the one latitude given by the Florentine in his  second voyage, while the courses and distances might be relied upon as  roughly correct if they were given by an honest man. Their absurdity  proves the imposture.    From \"the best harbour in the world\" Vespucci says that he went eastward  for 100 leagues to some very populous islands called _Iti_, where the  people, after severe fighting, were defeated by the Spaniards, 222 being  carried off as slaves. Having brought his _protege_ to Cape Hatteras,  Varnhagen would identify _Iti_ with Bermuda. But there were no natives  on Bermuda when it was discovered, and no indications that it had ever  been inhabited. The islands where this wholesale kidnapping took place,  if the story has any foundation in fact, were probably the Windward  Islands or the Bahamas, visited by Hojeda with this object after he  left St. Domingo. The word _Iti_ appears to have been an invention  of Vespucci: perhaps he was thinking of the old Italian form _Iti_  (\"gone\")--which he uses in its proper sense in his second voyage--or of  _Hayti_, the native name for Espanola.    There are two, or perhaps three, incidents in the story of the alleged  first voyage which happened in the voyage when Vespucci was with Hojeda.  The first is the village built on piles over the water. Such a village  was discovered by Hojeda at the entrance of the Gulf of Maracaibo, and  called Little Venice, or Venezuela. Vespucci describes exactly the same  thing in his first voyage, but does not mention it in his second (or  Hojeda) voyage. He took it out of the real voyage in order to embellish  the imaginary one. Varnhagen argues that there might easily have been  two villages built on piles. But that is not the point. The point is,  that there is no mention of the fact in its proper place, while it  occurs in this imaginary voyage in a way that points unmistakably to the  source whence it came.

THE POLAR FIGHT      On April 21, 1908, I reached a spot on the silver-shining desert of  boreal ice whereat a wild wave of joy filled my heart. I can remember  the scene distinctly--it will remain one of those comparatively few  mental pictures which are photographed with a terribly vivid  distinctness of detail, because of their emotional effect, during  everyone's existence, and which reassert themselves in the brain like  lightning flashes in stresses of intense emotion, in dreams, in the  delirium of sickness, and possibly in the hour of death.    I can see the sun lying low above the horizon, which glittered here and  there in shafts of light like the tip of a long, circular, silver blade.  The globe of fire, veiled occasionally by purplish, silver-shot mists,  was tinged with a faint, burning lilac. Through opening cracks in the  constantly moving field of ice, cold strata of air rose, deflecting the  sun's rays in every direction, and changing the vision of distant ice  irregularities with a deceptive perspective, as an oar blade seen in the  depth of still water.    Huge phantom-shapes took form about me; they were nebulous, their color  purplish. About the horizon moved what my imagination pictured as the  ghosts of dead armies--strange, gigantic, wraith-like shapes whose heads  rose above the horizon as the heads of a giant army appearing over the  summits of a far-away mountain. They moved forward, retreated,  diminished in size, and titanically reappeared again. Above them, in the  purple mists and darker clouds, shifted scintillantly waving flashes of  light, orange and crimson, the ghosts of their earthly battle banners,  wind-tossed, golden and bloodstained.    I stood gazing with wonder, half-appalled, forgetting that these were  mirages produced by cold air and deflected light rays, and feeling only  as though I were beholding some vague revelation of victorious hosts,  beings of that other world which in olden times, it is said, were  conjured at Endor. It seemed fitting that they should march and remarch  about me; that the low beating of the wind should suddenly swell into  throbbing martial music. For that moment I was intoxicated. I stood  alone, apart from my two Eskimo companions, a shifting waste of purple  ice on every side, alone in a dead world--a world of angry winds,  eternal cold, and desolate for hundreds of miles in every direction as  the planet before man was made.    I felt in my heart the thrill which any man must feel when an almost  impossible but dearly desired work is attained--the thrill of  accomplishment with which a poet must regard his greatest masterpiece,  which a sculptor must feel when he puts the finishing touch to inanimate  matter wherein he has expressed consummately a living thought, which a  conqueror must feel when he has mastered a formidable alien army.  Standing on this spot, I felt that I, a human being, with all of  humanity's frailties, had conquered cold, evaded famine, endured an  inhuman battling with a rigorous, infuriated Nature in a soul-racking,  body-sapping journey such as no man perhaps had ever made. I had proved  myself to myself, with no thought at the time of any worldy applause.  Only the ghosts about me, which my dazzled imagination evoked,  celebrated the glorious thing with me--a thing in which no human being  could have shared. Over and over again I repeated to myself that I had  reached the North Pole, and the thought thrilled through my nerves and  veins like the shivering sound of silver bells.    That was my hour of victory. It was the climacteric hour of my life. The  vision and the thrill, despite all that has passed since then, remain,  and will remain with me as long as life lasts, as the vision and the  thrill of an honest, actual accomplishment.    That I stood at the time on the very pivotal pin-point of the earth I do  not and never did claim; I may have, I may not. In that moving world of  ice, of constantly rising mists, with a low-lying sun whose rays are  always deflected, such an ascertainment of actual position, even with  instruments in the best workable condition, is, as all scientists will  agree, impossible. That I reached the North Pole approximately, and  ascertained my location as accurately, as painstakingly, as the  terrestrial and celestial conditions and the best instruments would  allow; that I thrilled with victory, and made my claim on as honest, as  careful, as scientific a basis of observations and calculations as any  human being could, I do emphatically assert. That any man, in reaching  this region, could do more than I did to ascertain definitely the  mathematical Pole, and that any more voluminous display of figures could  substantiate a claim of greater accuracy, I do deny. I believe still  what I told the world when I returned, that I am the first white man to  reach that spot known as the North Pole as far as it is, or ever will  be, humanly possible to ascertain the location of that spot.    Few men in all history, I am inclined to believe, have ever been made  the subject of such vicious attacks, of such malevolent assailing of  character, of such a series of perjured and forged charges, of such a  widespread and relentless press persecution, as I; and few men, I feel  sure, have ever been made to suffer so bitterly and so inexpressibly as  I because of the assertion of my achievement. So persistent, so  egregious, so overwhelming were the attacks made upon me that for a time  my spirit was broken, and in the bitterness of my soul I even felt  desirous of disappearing to some remote corner of the earth, to be  forgotten. I knew that envy was the incentive to all the unkind abuses  heaped upon me, and I knew also that in due time, when the public  agitation subsided and a better perspective followed, the justice of my  claim would force itself to the inevitable light of truth.    With this confidence in the future, I withdrew from the envious,  money-waged strife to the calm and restfulness of my own family circle.  The campaign of infamy raged and spent its force. The press lined up  with this dishonest movement by printing bribed, faked and forged news  items, deliberately manufactured by my enemies to feed a newspaper  hunger for sensation. In going away for a rest it did not seem prudent  to take"]]]
