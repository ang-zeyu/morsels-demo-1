Other Emperors had withstood the  Papal claims, but none had ever proved an antagonist like Frederick. His  quarrel seemed indeed to be with the Church itself, with its doctrines  and morals as well as with the ambition of churchmen; and he offered the  strange spectacle of a Roman Emperor--one of the twin lights in the  Christian firmament--whose favour was less easily won by Christian  piety, however eminent, than by the learning of the Arab or the Jew.  When compelled at last to fulfil a promise extorted from him of  conducting a crusade to the Holy Land, he scandalised Christendom by  making friends of the Sultan, and by using his presence in the East, not  for the deliverance of the Sepulchre, but for the furtherance of  learning and commerce. Thrice excommunicated, he had his revenge by  proving with how little concern the heaviest anathemas of the Church  could be met by one who was armed in unbelief. Literature, art, and  manners were sedulously cultivated in his Sicilian court, and among the  able ministers whom he selected or formed, the modern idea of the State  may be said to have had its birth. Free thinker and free liver, poet,  warrior, and statesman, he stood forward against the sombre background  of the Middle Ages a figure in every respect so brilliant and original  as well to earn from his contemporaries the title of the Wonder of the  World.    On the goodwill of Italians Frederick had the claim of being the most  Italian of all the Emperors since the revival of the Western Empire, and  the only one of them whose throne was permanently set on Italian soil.  Yet he never won the popular heart. To the common mind he always  appeared as something outlandish and terrible--as the man who had driven  a profitable but impious trade in the Sultan's land. Dante, in his  childhood, must have heard many a tale of him; and we find him keenly  interested in the character of the Emperor who came nearest to uniting  Italy into a great nation, in whose court there had been a welcome for  every man of intellect, and in whom a great original poet would have  found a willing and munificent patron. In the _Inferno_, by the mouth of  Pier delle Vigne, the Imperial Chancellor, he pronounces Frederick to  have been worthy of all honour;[5] yet justice requires him to lodge  this flower of kings in the burning tomb of the Epicureans, as having  been guilty of the arch-heresy of denying the moral government of the  world, and holding that with the death of the body all is ended.[6] It  was a heresy fostered by the lives of many churchmen, high and low; but  the example of Frederick encouraged the profession of it by nobles and  learned laymen. On Frederick's character there was a still darker stain  than this of religious indifference--that of cold-blooded cruelty. Even  in an age which had produced Ezzelino Romano, the Emperor's cloaks of  lead were renowned as the highest refinement in torture.[7] But, with  all his genius, and his want of scruple in the choice of means, he built  nothing politically that was not ere his death crumbling to dust. His  enduring work was that of an intellectual reformer under whose  protection and with whose personal help his native language was refined,  Europe was enriched with a learning new to it or long forgotten, and the  minds of men, as they lost their blind reverence for Rome, were prepared  for a freer treatment of all the questions with which religion deals. He  was thus in some respects a precursor of Dante.    More than once in the course of Frederick's career it seemed as if he  might become master of Tuscany in fact as well as in name, had Florence  only been as well affected to him as were Siena and Pisa. But already,  as has been said, the popular interest had been strengthened by  accessions from among the nobles. Others of them, without descending  into the ranks of the citizens, had set their hopes on being the first  in a commonwealth rather than privates in the Imperial garrison. These  men, with their restless and narrow ambitions, were as dangerous to have  for allies as for foes, but by throwing their weight into the popular  scale they at least served to hold the Imperialist magnates in check,  and established something like a balance in the fighting power of  Florence; and so, as in the days of Barbarossa, the city was preserved  from taking a side too strongly. The hearts of the Florentine traders  were in their own affairs--in extending their commerce and increasing  their territory and influence in landward Tuscany. As regarded the  general politics of Italy, their sympathy was still with the Roman See;  but it was a sympathy without devotion or gratitude. For refusing to  join in the crusade of 1238 the town was placed under interdict by  Gregory IX. The Emperor meanwhile was acknowledged as its lawful  overlord, and his vicar received something more than nominal obedience,  the choice of the chief magistrates being made subject to his approval.  Yet with all this, and although his party was powerful in the city, it  was but a grudging service that was yielded to Frederick. More than once  fines were levied on the Florentines; and worse punishments were  threatened for their persevering and active enmity to Siena, now  dominated by its nobles and held in the Imperial interest. Volunteers  from Florence might join the Emperor in his Lombard campaigns; but they  were left equally free by the Commonwealth to join the other side. At  last, when he was growing old, and when like his grandfather he had been  foiled by the stubborn Lombards, he turned on the Florentines as an  easier prey, and sent word to the nobles of his party to seize the city.  For months the streets were filled with battle. In January 1248,  Frederick of Antioch, the natural son of the Emperor, entered Florence  with some squadrons of men-at-arms, and a few days later the nobles that  had fought on the popular side were driven into banishment. This is  known in the Florentine annals as the first dispersion of the Guelfs.    Long before they were adopted in Italy, the names of Guelf and Ghibeline  had been employed in Germany to mark the partisans of the Bavarian Welf  and of the Hohenstaufen lords of Waiblingen. On Italian soil they  received an extended meaning: Ghibeline stood for Imperialist; Guelf for  anti-Imperialist, Papalist, or simply Nationalist. When the names began  to be freely used in Florence, which was towards the close of  Frederick's reign and about a century after their first invention, they  denoted no new start in politics, but only supplied a nomenclature for  parties already in existence. As far as Florence was concerned, the  designations were the more convenient that they were not too closely  descriptive. The Ghibeline was the Emperor's man, when it served his  purpose to be so; while the Guelf, constant only in his enmity to the  Ghibelines, was free to think of the Pope as he chose, and to serve him  no more than he wished or needed to. Ultimately, indeed, all Florence  may be said to have become Guelf. To begin with, the name distinguished  the nobles who sought alliance with the citizens, from the nobles who  looked on these as they might have done on serfs newly thriven into  wealth. Each party was to come up in turn. Within a period of twenty  years each was twice driven into banishment, a measure always  accompanied with decrees of confiscation and the levelling of private  strongholds in Florence. The exiles kept well together, retreating, as  it were in the order of war, to camps of observation they found ready  prepared for them in the nearest cities and fortresses held by those of  their own way of thinking. All their wits were then bent on how, by dint  of some fighting and much diplomacy, they might shake the strength and  undermine the credit of their successful rivals in the city, and secure  their own return in triumph. It was an art they were proud to be adepts  in.[8]    In a rapid sketch like this it would be impossible to tell half the  changes made on the constitution of Florence during the second part of  the thirteenth century. Dante in a well-known passage reproaches  Florence with the political restlessness which afflicted her like a  disease. Laws, he says, made in October were fallen into desuetude ere  mid-November.[9] And yet it may be that in this constant readiness to  change, lies the best proof of the political capacity of the  Florentines. It was to meet new necessities that they made provision of  new laws. Especial watchfulness was called for against the encroachments  of the grandees, whose constant tendency--whatever their party  name--was to weaken legal authority, and play the part of lords and  masters of the citizens. But these were no mere weavers and  quill-drivers to be plundered at will. Even before the return of the  Guelfs, banished in 1248, the citizens, taking advantage of a check  suffered in the field by the dominant Ghibelines, had begun to recast  the constitution in a popular sense, and to organise the townsmen as a  militia on a permanent footing. When, on the death of Frederick in 1250,  the Imperialist nobles were left without foreign aid, there began a  period of ten years, favourably known in Florentine history as the  Government of the _Primo Popolo_ or _Popolo Vecchio_; that is, of the  true body of the citizens, commoners possessed of franchises, as  distinguished from the nobles above them and the multitude below. For it  is never to be forgotten that Florence, like Athens, and like the other  Italian Republics, was far from being a true democracy. The time was yet  to come, and it was not far distant, when the ranks of citizenship were  to be more widely opened than now to those below, and more closely shut  to those above. In the meantime the comparatively small number of  wealthy"]]]
