But we did go barefooted all winter until we was grown and  married. We had all de wood we wanted fer fire. We kept fire all day and  all night. We sot by de fire in winter and popped corn, parched pinders  [HW: peanuts] and roasted corn ears.    \"Marster and Mistress had six chilluns. Her name was Ellen and her house  was three stories high. Dere overseers allus lived wid dem. Dere was a  lot of slaves and dey all loved de white folks. De whole plantation was  allus up at sunup.

Dere was no jail fer us; de Patter-rollers kept us straight.    \"When I got to be a big boy, my Ma got religion at de Camp meeting at  El-Bethel. She shouted and sung fer three days, going all over de  plantation and de neighboring ones, inviting her friends to come to see  her baptized and shouting and praying fer dem. She went around to all de  people dat she had done wrong and begged dere forgiveness. She sent fer  dem dat had wronged her, and told dem dat she was born again and a new  woman, and dat she would forgive dem. She wanted everybody dat was not  saved to go up wid her.    \"De white folks was baptized in de pool first, and den dere darkies.  When de darkies time come, dey sung and shouted so loud dat de  Patter-rollers come from somewhar, but Marster and Missus made dem go  away and let us shout and rejoice to de fullest. Missus had all her  darkies to wear white calico in de pool dat was a-gwine in fer  baptizing. In de sewing-room she had calico robes made fer everybody. My  Ma took me wid her to see her baptized, and I was so happy dat I sung  and shouted wid her. All de niggers jined in singing. De white folks  stayed and saw us baptize our folks, and dey liked our singing.\"          Thomas Jefferson          *Interview with Thomas Jefferson, 102 years old*      *Shiloh Church, Highway 29*      --_Ellie S. Rice, Anderson, S.C._    It is not often that a person 102 years old is seen doing manual labor,  and especially as hard a job as picking cotton. Yet that is just what  Thomas Jefferson was doing, who, as he himself stated, is, \"102 years  and 18 days old today.\" Asked why he was doing this, he replied, \"Just  to take a little exercise.\"    Thomas lives with his daughter, Florence Humphreys, on a small farm, out  near Shiloh Church, on Highway 29. Until recently, he slept in a little  shack nearby, taking his meals with his daughter. He is too feeble to  live alone now, however.    Thomas Jefferson was born on the farm of Mr. Jenkins Hammond, on the old  Hammond place, out on the Williamston road, on November 1, 1834. When  Mr. Hammond's daughter, Mary Amanda Pauline, married Elias John Earle,  son of Samuel Girard Earle, who was one of the very first citizens of  Anderson county, Mr. Hammond gave her, as a wedding gift, Thomas  Jefferson's mother and five children, of which Thomas was one. And here  he lived with the Earles on \"Evergreen\" plantation, for many, many  years.    During the War Between the States, Mr. Earle operated a corn and flour  mill, and Thomas Jefferson was his miller. Asked if he remembered this,  he replied, \"Well, I do remember it. I remember one time we worked all  night Saturday night, all day Sunday and Sunday night, and Monday  morning had ten barrels of flour to send the Confederate army.\"    Shiloh (Baptist) Church, nearby, Thomas said, was being constructed at  the time the war started, and was not finished until after the war was  over. The first person buried in the Shiloh graveyard was Elijah  Herring, who was in the Confederate army and became ill and died, and  was brought home to be buried.    When Samuel Girard Earle died in 1848, and his wife in 1865, they were  buried under a large apple tree at \"Evergreen\" plantation. Later, their  bodies were removed to the Shiloh graveyard, by their grand-daughter,  Miss Betty Earle. Thomas says he helped to move and rebury the bodies.    Thomas was at one time a member of Shiloh, but is now a member of the  Mt. Sinai colored church.    Thomas is remarkably well for a person one hundred and two years old.  His eyes are dim, his steps tottering, but his hearing is good and his  mind is as clear as it ever was. Asked about his appetite, he said, \"I  eat anything I can get, I can eat anything.\" Many people much younger  than he is, and certainly with more money than he has, would envy him  for his splendid digestion.    Thomas has been on the relief rolls now for several years. It is a  peculiar pleasure for Mrs. A.M. Mitchell, County Director of Temporary  State Department of Public Welfare, to look after Thomas personally,  because her grandmother was the bride to whom he was given, with his  mother and brothers and sisters. The old man eagerly anticipates Mrs.  Mitchell's coming each month, to bring his check and to look after his  comfort. He is very humble and exceedingly grateful for everything done  for him, and says he is expecting to live many more years, with the good  care he is getting.          Henry D. Jenkins          *Interview with Henry D. Jenkins, 87 years old*      --_W.W. Dixon, Winnsboro, S.C._    Henry D. Jenkins lives in a four-room frame house, which he owns. His  wife, two single daughters, his son and his son's wife and three small  children live with him. The house is constructed on a tract of land  containing four hundred and eighty (480) acres, which Henry also owns.    He does not suffer with an inferiority complex. He is self-reliant and  thrifty, with a pardonable pride in his farm and his rise from slavery  to a position of respectibility as a church member, citizen, and tax  payer. He is well preserved physically, for his age, 87 years, alert in  his movements and animated in conversation.    His plantation and home is in the south western part of Fairfield  County, six or seven hundred yards east of State highway #215.    \"Yes sir, tho' I am a 'spectable colored citizen, as you see me; I pays  taxes and owns my own plantation. I was once a slave on de Reese place,  in Sumter County, below Columbia. Just when I come to b'long to Mr.  Joseph Howell, I don't know.

Some tropical mammals  with very thin fur coats, and others with nearly hairless bodies, have  high C_{m}'s (McNab, 1984a), as do burrowing mammals (McNab, 1966,  1979b, 1984a) and the kit fox, _Vulpes macrotis_ (Golightly and  Ohmart, 1983). Some small mammals with low basal metabolic rates tend  to have lower than predicted C_{m}'s: small marsupials (McNab, 1978a),  heteromyid rodents (McNab, 1979a), several ant eaters (McNab, 1984a),  the arctic hare, _Lepus arcticus_ (Wang et al., 1973), the ringtail,  _Bassariscus astutus_ (Chevalier, 1985), and the fennec, _Fennecus  zerda_ (Noll-Banholzer, 1979). Thus, in spite of its mass dependence,  C_{m} also has been modified during the course of evolution by  selective factors in the environment and by the animal's own metabolic  characteristics.      _Capacity for Evaporative Cooling_    Latent heat loss occurs as a result of evaporation from the  respiratory tract and through the skin, and except under conditions of  heat stress, it \"is a liability in thermal and osmotic homeostasis\"  (Calder and King, 1974:302). E_{c}, defined as the ratio of  evaporative heat lost to metabolic heat produced, can be used to  quantify thermoregulatory effectiveness of evaporative cooling and to  make comparisons of heat tolerance between species. Thermoregulatory  effectiveness of latent heat loss is not just a function of the rate  of evaporative water loss but also of the rate of metabolic heat  production (Lasiewski and Seymour, 1972). For example, a low metabolic  rate minimizes endogenous heat load and thus conserves water, whereas  the opposite is true of high metabolic rates (Lasiewski and Seymour,  1972). Some mammals that live in arid regions have evolved low  metabolic rates and thus capitalize on this relationship to reduce  their thermoregulatory water requirement (McNab and Morrison, 1963;  McNab, 1966; MacMillen and Lee, 1970; Noll-Banholzer, 1979). What is  evident, therefore, is that an animal's capacity for increasing latent  heat loss must evolve together with its [.H]_{b} and C_{m} in response  to specific environmental demands.      _Diet_    McNab (1986a, 1988a, 1989) demonstrated that, for mammals, departures  of [.H]_{b} from the Kleiber (1961:206) \"norm\" are highly correlated  with diet and independent of phylogenetic relationships. McNab's  analysis indicates that for mammals that feed on invertebrates, those  species with body mass less than 100 g have [.H]_{b}'s that are equal  to or greater than values predicted by the Kleiber equation, whereas  those with body mass greater than 100 g have metabolic rates that are  lower than predicted. Grazers, vertebrate eaters, nut eaters, and  terrestrial frugivores also have [.H]_{b}'s that are equal to or  greater than predicted, whereas insectivorous bats, arboreal  folivores, arboreal frugivores, and terrestrial folivores all have  rates that are lower than predicted. McNab (1986a) found animals with  mixed diets harder to categorize, but in general he predicted that  their [.H]_{b}'s would be related to (1) a food item that is  constantly available throughout the year, (2) a food item that is most  available during the worst conditions of the year, or (3) a mix of  foods available during the worst time of the year. Although these  correlations do not establish cause and effect between food habits and  [.H]_{b}, McNab's analysis does make it clear that the relationship  between these variables has very real consequences for an animal's  physiology, ecology, and evolution.        EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND SUMMARY      In this investigation we measured basal and thermoregulatory  metabolism, evaporative water loss, and body temperature of raccoons  from north central Virginia. Measurements were conducted on both sexes  in summer and winter to determine how season and sex influenced these  variables. We then compared the data for this widely distributed  generalist with data from literature for its ecologically more  restricted relatives. Dietary data for all species were taken from  literature, as were reproductive data for calculation of r_{max}.    Our analysis demonstrated clear differences between _Procyon lotor_  and other procyonids with respect to [.H]_{b}, C_{mw}, D_{d}, and  r_{max}. The composite score calculated from these variables for  _Procyon lotor_ was much higher than those derived for other species,  and there was a positive correlation between the number of climates a  species occupies and the magnitude of its composite score. Data on  evaporative water loss, although not complete for all species,  suggested that tropical and subtropical procyonids have less capacity  for evaporative cooling than _Procyon lotor_ or _Bassariscus astutus_.  It was clear, therefore, that with respect to its thermal physiology,  _Procyon lotor_ differed markedly from other procyonids, and we  contend that these differences have allowed this species to become a  highly successful climate generalist and to expand its distribution  into many different habitats and climates. Our analysis also suggested  that the cornerstone of _Procyon lotor_'s success as a climate  generalist is its [.H]_{b}, which is higher than the procyonid norm.        ACKNOWLEDGMENTS      The authors would like to thank John Eisenberg and Devra Kleiman for  their support and encouragement throughout the study. This  investigation was supported by research grants from the West Virginia  School of Osteopathic Medicine (WVSOM), and Friends of the National  Zoo (FONZ). Logistic support was provided by the National Zoological  Park's Conservation and Research Center (CRC), and the departments of  Mammalogy and Zoological Research. Our ability to conduct  physiological research at CRC was made possible by the thoughtful  support and encouragement provided by Chris Wemmer. His excellent  staff at CRC, especially Jack Williams, Junior Allison, and Red  McDaniel, were very helpful in providing hospitality and logistical  support to the senior author and his family during their various  visits to the Center. The assistance of several people at the National  Zoo also is gratefully acknowledged: Mitch Bush and Lyndsay Phillips  not only provided veterinary support throughout the investigation,  but also performed surgical procedures required to implant  temperature-sensitive radio transmitters in several raccoons; Olav  Oftedal made his laboratory available to us at various times and  loaned us equipment to use at CRC; Miles Roberts and his staff  provided care for our captive raccoons in the Department of Zoological  Research during various parts of the investigation. Greg Sanders and  Ken Halama, supported by FONZ assistantships, cared for our captive  raccoons at CRC, provided assistance in the laboratory whenever  needed, and were an invaluable source of aid. Their friendship and  help is gratefully acknowledged. Ellen Broudy and Andy Meyer,  supported by WVSOM and a student work study grant, respectively,  provided assistance in the laboratory. David Brown, John Eisenberg,  Mary Etta Hight, Brian McNab, Steve Thompson, and W. Chris Wozencraft  critically reviewed various phases of the manuscript and provided many  helpful suggestions. We deeply appreciate the work of Jean B.  McConville, whose beneficial editorial suggestions helped us improve  several early versions of the manuscript. We also gratefully  acknowledge Diane M. Tyler, our editor at the Smithsonian Institution  Press, whose expertise helped us mold the manuscript into its final  form. Jill Mellon and Sriyanie Miththalapa, supported by FONZ  traineeships, assisted in measuring the daily cycle of body  temperature in raccoons. The Virginia Commission of Game and Inland  Fisheries gave us permission to use wild-caught raccoons in this  project.          $Materials and Methods$        LIVE-TRAPPING      Raccoons were caught from May 1980 through December 1984 on a trapping  grid of 30 to 35 stations (one or two \"live traps\" per station) that  covered about one-third of the National Zoological Park's Conservation  and Research Center (CRC) near Front Royal, Virginia (Seidensticker et  al., 1988; Hallett et al., 1991). Animals were trapped during 10  consecutive days each month, and in this five-year interval 407  raccoons were captured and marked with tattoos and ear tags. All  captured animals were individualized with respect to age, reproductive  status, physical condition, parasite load, and mass and body  dimensions. These data characterized the structure and dynamics of the  raccoon population at CRC and provided information on the annual  cycle of fattening for raccoons in north central Virginia.    Animals used for metabolic measurements were captured at CRC about  1.5 km south of the trapping grid and thus were genetically  representative of the area. Six males were captured and measured during  the summer of 1983. These animals were kept isolated for a week before  being measured and were released later that summer at the site of their  capture. The other seven animals used in our study were from the  collection of the National Zoological Park and all of them had their  origins at CRC.        METABOLIC STUDIES      _Basal and Thermoregulatory Metabolism_    Metabolic measurements, conducted at CRC, were carried out on eight  males during July and August 1983, on four females and three males  from November 1983 through March 1984, and on four females during June  and July 1984.    Raccoons were housed throughout the study such that they were  constantly exposed to a natural cycle of temperature and photoperiod.  Weather records for the Front Royal area indicate that average  temperatures are around -0.5 deg.C in January and 23.3 deg.C in July  (Crockett, 1972). Light:dark (L:D) periods for the"]]]
