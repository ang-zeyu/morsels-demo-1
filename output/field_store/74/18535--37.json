Other birds may like to travel alone, but when jolly Mr. Bobolink and  his quiet little wife come from the South, where they have spent the  winter, they come with a large party of friends. When South, they eat so  much rice that the people call them Rice Birds. When they come North,  they enjoy eating wheat, barley, oats and insects.    Mr. and Mrs. Bobolink build their simple little nest of grasses in some  field. It is hard to find on the ground, for it looks just like dry  grass. Mrs. Bobolink wears a dull dress, so she cannot be seen when she  is sitting on the precious eggs. She does not sing a note while caring  for the eggs. Why do you think that is?    Mr. Bob-Linkum does not wear a sober dress, as you can see by his  picture. He does not need to be hidden. He is just as jolly as he  looks. Shall I tell you how he amuses his mate while she is sitting?  He springs from the dew-wet grass with a sound like peals of merry  laughter. He frolics from reed to post, singing as if his little heart  would burst with joy.    Don't you think Mr. and Mrs. Bobolink look happy in the picture? They  have raised their family of five. Four of their children have gone to  look for food; one of them--he must surely be the baby--would rather  stay with his mamma and papa. Which one does he look like?    Many birds are quiet at noon and in the afternoon. A flock of Bobolinks  can be heard singing almost all day long. The song is full of high notes  and low, soft notes and loud, all sung rapidly. It is as gay and bright  as the birds themselves, who flit about playfully as they sing. You will  feel like laughing as merrily as they sing when you hear it some day.    [Illustration: BOBOLINKS.]          THE BLUE BIRD.          \"Drifting down the first warm wind        That thrills the earliest days of spring,      The Bluebird seeks our maple groves        And charms them into tasselling.\"        \"He sings, and his is Nature's voice--        A gush of melody sincere      From that great fount of harmony        Which thaws and runs when Spring is here.\"        \"Short is his song, but strangely sweet        To ears aweary of the low      Dull tramps of Winter's sullen feet,        Sandalled in ice and muffled in snow.\"           *       *       *        \"Think, every morning, when the sun peeps through         The dim, leaf-latticed windows of the grove,       How jubilant the happy birds renew         Their old, melodious madrigals of love!       And when you think of this, remember, too,         'Tis always morning somewhere, and above       The awakening continents, from shore to shore,       Somewhere the birds are singing evermore.        \"Think of your woods and orchards without birds!         Of empty nests that cling to boughs and beams       As in an idiot's brain remembered words         Hang empty 'mid the cobwebs of his dreams!       Will bleat of flocks or bellowing of herds         Make up for the lost music, when your teams       Drag home the stingy harvest, and no more       The feathered gleaners follow to your door?\"                      FROM \"THE BIRDS OF KILLINGSWORTH.\"          THE CROW.      Caw! Caw! Caw! little boys and girls. Caw! Caw! Caw! Just look at my  coat of feathers. See how black and glossy it is. Do you wonder I am  proud of it?    Perhaps you think I look very solemn and wise, and not at all as if I  cared to play games. I do, though; and one of the games I like best is  hide-and-seek. I play it with the farmer in the spring. He hides, in the  rich, brown earth, golden kernels of corn. Surely he does it because he  knows I like it, for sometimes he puts up a stick all dressed like a man  to show where the corn is hidden. Sometimes I push my bill down into the  earth to find the corn, and at other times I wait until tiny green  leaves begin to show above the ground, and then I get my breakfast  without much trouble. I wonder if the farmer enjoys this game as much  as I do. I help him, too, by eating worms and insects.    During the spring and summer I live in my nest on the top of a very  high tree. It is built of sticks and grasses and straw and string and  anything else I can pick up. But in the fall, I and all my relations and  friends live together in great roosts or rookeries. What good times we  do have--hunting all day for food and talking all night. Wouldn't you  like to be with us?    The farmer who lives in the house over there went to the mill to-day  with a load of corn.    One of the ears dropped out of the wagon and it didn't take me long to  find it. I have eaten all I can possibly hold and am wondering now what  is the best thing to do. If you were in my place would you leave it here  and not tell anybody and come back to-morrow and finish it? Or would you  fly off and get Mrs. Crow and some of the children to come and finish  it? I believe I'll fly and get them. Good-bye.    Caw! Caw! Caw!    [Illustration: COMMON CROW.]          THE COMMON CROW.          \"The crow doth sing as merry as the lark,       When neither is attended.\"    Few birds have more interesting characteristics than the Common Crow,  being, in many of his actions, very like the Raven, especially in his  love for carrion. Like the Raven, he has been known to attack game,  although his inferior size forces him to call to his assistance the aid  of his fellows to cope with larger creatures. Rabbits and hares are  frequently the prey of this bird which pounces on them as they steal  abroad to feed. His food consists of reptiles, frogs, and lizards; he  is a plunderer of other birds' nests. On the seashore he finds crabs,  shrimps and inhabited shells, which he ingeniously cracks by flying with  them to a great height and letting them fall upon a convenient rock.    The crow is seen in single pairs or in little bands of four or five.  In the autumn evenings, however, they assemble in considerable flocks  before going to roost and make a wonderful chattering, as if comparing  notes of the events of the day.    The nest of the Crow is placed in some tree remote from habitations of  other birds. Although large and very conspicuous at a distance, it is  fixed upon one of the topmost branches quite out of reach of the hand of  the adventurous urchin who longs to secure its contents. It is loosely  made and saucer shaped. Sticks and softer substances are used to  construct it, and it is lined with hair and fibrous roots. Very recently  a thrifty and intelligent Crow built for itself a summer residence in an  airy tree near Bombay, the material used being gold, silver, and steel  spectacle frames, which the bird had stolen from an optician of that  city. Eighty-four frames had been used for this purpose, and they were  so ingeniously woven together that the nest was quite a work of art.  The eggs are variable, or rather individual, in their markings, and  even in their size. The Crow rarely uses the same nest twice, although  he frequently repairs to the same locality from year to year. He is  remarkable for his attachment to his mate and young, surpassing the  Fawn and Turtle Dove in conjugal courtesy.    The Somali Arabs bear a deadly hatred toward the Crow. The origin of  their detestation is the superstition that during the flight of Mohammed  from his enemies, he hid himself in a cave, where he was perceived by  the Crow, at that time a bird of light plumage, who, when he saw the  pursuers approaching the spot, perched above Mohammed's hiding place,  and screamed, \"Ghar! Ghar!\" (cave! cave!) so as to indicate the place  of concealment. His enemies, however, did not understand the bird, and  passed on, and Mohammed, when he came out of the cave, clothed the Crow  in perpetual black, and commanded him to cry \"Ghar\" as long as Crows  should live.    And he lives to a good old age. Instances are not rare where he has  attained to half a century, without great loss of activity or failure of  sight.    At Red Bank, a few miles northeast of Cincinnati, on the Little Miami  River, in the bottoms, large flocks of Crows congregate the year around.  A few miles away, high upon Walnut Hills, is a Crow roost, and in the  late afternoons the Crows, singly, in pairs, and in flocks, are seen on  the wing, flying heavily, with full crops, on the way to the roost, from  which they descend in the early morning, crying \"Caw! Caw!\" to the  fields of the newly planted, growing, or matured corn, or corn stacks,  as the season may provide.          THE RETURN OF THE BIRDS.           \"Everywhere the blue sky belongs to them and is their appointed       rest, and their native country, and their own natural home       which they enter unannounced as lords that are certainly       expected, and yet there is a silent joy at their arrival.\"    The return of the birds to their real home in the North, where they  build their nests and rear their young, is regarded by all genuine  lovers of earth's messengers of gladness and gayety as one of the most  interesting and poetical of annual occurrences. The naturalist, who  notes the very day of each arrival, in order that he may verify former  observation or add to his material gathered for a new work, does not  necessarily anticipate with greater pleasure this event than do many  whose lives are brightened by the coming of the friends of their youth,  who alone of early companions do not change. First of all--and ever the  same delightful warbler--the Bluebird, who, in 1895, did not appear at  all in many localities, though here in considerable numbers last year,  betrays himself. \"Did he come down out of the heaven on that bright  March morning when he told us so softly and plaintively that, if we  pleased, spring had come?\" Sometimes he is here a little earlier, and  must keep his courage up until the cold snap is over and the snow is  gone.

CHORUS Io! io! forward to the attack, throw yourselves upon the foe,  spill his blood; take to your wings and surround them on all sides. Woe  to them! let us get to work with our beaks, let us devour them. Nothing  can save them from our wrath, neither the mountain forests, nor the  clouds that float in the sky, nor the foaming deep. Come, peck, tear  to ribbons. Where is the chief of the cohort? Let him engage the right  wing.    EUELPIDES This is the fatal moment. Where shall I fly to, unfortunate  wretch that I am?    PISTHETAERUS Stay! stop here!    EUELPIDES That they may tear me to pieces?    PISTHETAERUS And how do you think to escape them?    EUELPIDES I don't know at all.    PISTHETAERUS Come, I will tell you. We must stop and fight them. Let us  arm ourselves with these stew-pots.    EUELPIDES Why with the stew-pots?    PISTHETAERUS The owl will not attack us.(1)    f(1) An allusion to the Feast of Pots; it was kept at Athens on the  third day of the Anthesteria, when all sorts of vegetables were stewed  together and offered for the dead to Bacchus and Athene. This Feast  was peculiar to Athens.--Hence Pisthetaerus thinks that the owl will  recognize they are Athenians by seeing the stew-pots, and as he is an  Athenian bird, he will not attack them.    EUELPIDES But do you see all those hooked claws?    PISTHETAERUS Seize the spit and pierce the foe on your side.    EUELPIDES And how about my eyes?    PISTHETAERUS Protect them with this dish or this vinegar-pot.    EUELPIDES Oh! what cleverness! what inventive genius! You are a great  general, even greater than Nicias,(1) where stratagem is concerned.    f(1) Nicias, the famous Athenian general.--The siege of Melos in 417  B.C., or two years previous to the production of 'The Birds,' had  especially done him great credit. He was joint commander of the Sicilian  expedition.    CHORUS Forward, forward, charge with your beaks! Come, no delay. Tear,  pluck, strike, flay them, and first of all smash the stew-pot.    EPOPS Oh, most cruel of all animals, why tear these two men to pieces,  why kill them? What have they done to you? They belong to the same  tribe, to the same family as my wife.(1)    f(1) Procne, the daughter of Pandion, King of Athens.    CHORUS Are wolves to be spared? Are they not our most mortal foes? So  let us punish them.    EPOPS If they are your foes by nature, they are your friends in heart,  and they come here to give you useful advice.    CHORUS Advice or a useful word from their lips, from them, the enemies  of my forebears!    EPOPS The wise can often profit by the lessons of a foe, for caution is  the mother of safety. 'Tis just such a thing as one will not learn from  a friend and which an enemy compels you to know. To begin with, 'tis the  foe and not the friend that taught cities to build high walls, to equip  long vessels of war; and 'tis this knowledge that protects our children,  our slaves and our wealth.    CHORUS Well then, I agree, let us first hear them, for 'tis best; one  can even learn something in an enemy's school.    PISTHETAERUS Their wrath seems to cool. Draw back a little.    EPOPS 'Tis only justice, and you will thank me later.    CHORUS Never have we opposed your advice up to now.    PISTHETAERUS They are in a more peaceful mood; put down your stew-pot  and your two dishes; spit in hand, doing duty for a spear, let us mount  guard inside the camp close to the pot and watch in our arsenal closely;  for we must not fly.    EUELPIDES You are right. But where shall we be buried, if we die?    PISTHETAERUS In the Ceramicus;(1) for, to get a public funeral, we shall  tell the Strategi that we fell at Orneae,(2) fighting the country's  foes.    f(1) A space beyond the walls of Athens which contained the gardens of  the Academy and the graves of citizens who had died for their country.    f(2) A town in Western Argolis, where the Athenians had been recently  defeated. The somewhat similar work in Greek signifies 'birds.'    CHORUS Return to your ranks and lay down your courage beside your wrath  as the Hoplites do. Then let us ask these men who they are, whence they  come, and with what intent. Here, Epops, answer me.    EPOPS Are you calling me? What do you want of me?    CHORUS Who are they? From what country?    EPOPS Strangers, who have come from Greece, the land of the wise.    CHORUS And what fate has led them hither to the land of the birds?    EPOPS Their love for you and their wish to share your kind of life; to  dwell and remain with you always.    CHORUS Indeed, and what are their plans?    EPOPS They are wonderful, incredible, unheard of.    CHORUS Why, do they think to see some advantage that determines them to  settle here? Are they hoping with our help to triumph over their foes or  to be useful to their friends?    EPOPS They speak of benefits so great it is impossible either to  describe or conceive them; all shall be yours, all that we see here,  there, above and below us; this they vouch for.    CHORUS Are they mad?    EPOPS They are the sanest people in the world.    CHORUS Clever men?    EPOPS The slyest of foxes, cleverness its very self, men of the world,  cunning, the cream of knowing folk.    CHORUS Tell them to speak and speak quickly; why, as I listen to you, I  am beside myself with delight.    EPOPS Here, you there, take all these weapons and hang them up inside  close to the fire, near the figure of the god who presides there and  under his protection;(1) as for you, address the birds, tell them why I  have gathered them together.    f(1) Epops is addressing the two slaves, no doubt Xanthias and Manes,  who are mentioned later on.    PISTHETAERUS Not I, by Apollo, unless they agree with me as the little  ape of an armourer agreed with his wife, not to bite me, nor pull me by  the parts, nor shove things up my...    CHORUS You mean the...(PUTS FINGER TO BOTTOM) Oh! be quite at ease.    PISTHETAERUS No, I mean my eyes.    CHORUS Agreed.    PISTHETAERUS Swear it.    CHORUS I swear it and, if I keep my promise, let judges and spectators  give me the victory unanimously.    PISTHETAERUS It is a bargain.    CHORUS And if I break my word, may I succeed by one vote only.    HERALD Hearken, ye people! Hoplites, pick up your weapons and return  to your firesides; do not fail to read the decrees of dismissal we have  posted.    CHORUS Man is a truly cunning creature, but nevertheless explain.  Perhaps you are going to show me some good way to extend my power,  some way that I have not had the wit to find out and which you have  discovered. Speak! 'tis to your own interest as well as to mine, for if  you secure me some advantage, I will surely share it with you. But what  object can have induced you to come among us? Speak boldly, for I shall  not break the truce,--until you have told us all.    PISTHETAERUS I am bursting with desire to speak; I have already mixed  the dough of my address and nothing prevents me from kneading it....  Slave! bring the chaplet and water, which you must pour over my hands.  Be quick!(1)    f(1) It was customary, when speaking in public and also at feasts, to  wear a chaplet; hence the question Euelpides puts.--The guests wore  chaplets of flowers, herbs, and leaves, which had the property of being  refreshing.    EUELPIDES Is it a question of feasting? What does it all mean?    PISTHETAERUS By Zeus, no! but I am hunting for fine, tasty words to  break down the hardness of their hearts.--I grieve so much for you, who  at one time were kings...    CHORUS We kings! Over whom?    PISTHETAERUS ...of all that exists, firstly of me and of this man, even  of Zeus himself. Your race is older than Saturn, the Titans and the  Earth.    CHORUS What, older than the Earth!    PISTHETAERUS By Phoebus, yes.    CHORUS By Zeus, but I never knew that before!    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis because you are ignorant and heedless, and have never  read your Aesop. 'Tis he who tells us that the lark was born before all  other creatures, indeed before the Earth; his father died of sickness,  but the Earth did not exist then; he remained unburied for five days,  when the bird in its dilemma decided, for want of a better place, to  entomb its father in its own head.    EUELPIDES So that the lark's father is buried at Cephalae.(1)    f(1) A deme of Attica. In Greek the word also means 'heads,' and hence  the pun.    EPOPS Hence, if we existed before the Earth, before the gods, the  kingship belongs to us by right of priority.    EUELPIDES Undoubtedly, but sharpen your beak well; Zeus won't be in a  hurry to hand over his sceptre to the woodpecker.    PISTHETAERUS It was not the gods, but the birds, who were formerly the  masters and kings over men; of this I have a thousand proofs. First of  all, I will point you to the cock, who governed the Persians before all  other monarchs, before Darius and Megabyzus.(1) 'Tis in memory of his  reign that he is called the Persian bird.    f(1) One of Darius' best generals. After his expedition against the  Scythians, this prince gave him the command of the army which he left  in Europe. Megabyzus took Perinthos (afterwards called Heraclea) and  conquered Thrace.    EUELPIDES For this reason also, even to-day, he alone of all the birds  wears his tiara straight on his head, like the Great King.(1)    f(1) All Persians wore the tiara, but always on one side; the Great King  alone wore it straight on his head.    PISTHETAERUS He was so strong, so great, so feared, that even now, on  account of his ancient power, everyone jumps out of bed as soon as  ever he crows at daybreak. Blacksmiths, potters, tanners, shoemakers,  bathmen, corn-dealers, lyre-makers and armourers, all put on their shoes  and go to work before it is daylight.    EUELPIDES I can tell you something about that. 'Twas the cock's fault  that I lost a splendid tunic of Phrygian wool. I was at a feast in town,  given to"]]]
