[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4035"],[0,"Greek Studies: a Series of Essays (#4)"],[1," Dionysus.  \"At Thebes alone,\" says Sophocles,  \"mortal women bear immortal gods.\"  His mother is the daughter of  Cadmus, himself marked out by [24] many curious circumstances as the  close kinsman of the earth, to which he all but returns at last, as  the serpent, in his old age, attesting some closer sense lingering  there of the affinity of man with the dust from whence he came.  Semele, an old Greek word, as it seems, for the surface of the earth,  the daughter of Cadmus, beloved by Zeus, desires to see her lover in  the glory with which he is seen by the immortal Hera.  He appears to  her in lightning.  But the mortal may not behold him and live.  Semele gives premature birth to the child Dionysus; whom, to preserve  it from the jealousy of Hera, Zeus hides in a part of his thigh, the  child returning into the loins of its father, whence in due time it  is born again.  Yet in this fantastic story, hardly less than in the  legend of Ariadne, the story of Dionysus has become a story of human  persons, with human fortunes, and even more intimately human appeal  to sympathy; so that Euripides, pre-eminent as a poet of pathos,  finds in it a subject altogether to his mind.  All the interest now  turns on the development of its points of moral or sentimental  significance; the love of the immortal for the mortal, the  presumption of the daughter of man who desires to see the divine form  as it is; on the fact that not without loss of sight, or life itself,  can man look upon it.  The travail of nature has been transformed  into the pangs of the human mother; and the poet dwells much on the  pathetic incident of death in childbirth, making [25] Dionysus, as  Callimachus calls him, a seven months' child, cast out among its  enemies, motherless.  And as a consequence of this human interest,  the legend attaches itself, as in an actual history, to definite  sacred objects and places, the venerable relic of the wooden image  which fell into the chamber of Semele with the lightning-flash, and  which the piety of a later age covered with plates of brass; the Ivy-  Fountain near Thebes, the water of which was so wonderfully bright  and sweet to drink, where the nymphs bathed the new-born child; the  grave of Semele, in a sacred enclosure grown with ancient vines,  where some volcanic heat or flame was perhaps actually traceable,  near the lightning-struck ruins of her supposed abode.    Yet, though the mystical body of the earth is forgotten in the human  anguish of the mother of Dionysus, the sense of his essence of fire  and dew still lingers in his most sacred name, as the son of Semele,  Dithyrambus.  We speak of a certain wild music in words or rhythm as  dithyrambic, like the dithyrambus, that is, the wild choral-singing  of the worshippers of Dionysus.  But Dithyrambus seems to have been,  in the first instance, the name, not of the hymn, but of the god to  whom the hymn is sung; and, through a tangle of curious etymological  speculations as to the precise derivation of this name, one thing  seems clearly visible, that it commemorates, namely, the double birth  of the vine-god; that [26] he is born once and again; his birth,  first of fire, and afterwards of dew; the two dangers that beset him;  his victory over two enemies, the capricious, excessive heats and  colds of spring.    He is pyrigenês,+ then, fire-born, the son of lightning; lightning  being to light, as regards concentration, what wine is to the other  strengths of the earth.  And who that has rested a hand on the  glittering silex of a vineyard slope in August, where the pale globes  of sweetness are lying, does not feel this?  It is out of the bitter  salts of a smitten, volcanic soil that it comes up with the most  curious virtues.  The mother faints and is parched up by the heat  which brings the child to the birth; and it pierces through, a wonder  of freshness, drawing its everlasting green and typical coolness out  of the midst of the ashes; its own stem becoming at last like a  tangled mass of tortured metal.  In thinking of Dionysus, then, as  fire-born, the Greeks apprehend and embody the sentiment, the poetry,  of all tender things which grow out of a hard soil, or in any sense  blossom before the leaf, like the little mezereon-plant of English  gardens, with its pale-purple, wine-scented flowers upon the leafless  twigs in February, or like the almond-trees of Tuscany, or Aaron's  rod that budded, or the staff in the hand of the Pope when  Tannhäuser's repentance is accepted.    And his second birth is of the dew.  The fire of which he was born  would destroy him in [27] his turn, as it withered up his mother; a  second danger comes; from this the plant is protected by the  influence of the cooling cloud, the lower part of his father the sky,  in which it is wrapped and hidden, and of which it is born again, its  second mother being, in some versions of the legend, Hyé--the Dew.  The nursery, where Zeus places it to be brought up, is a cave in  Mount Nysa, sought by a misdirected ingenuity in many lands, but  really, like the place of the carrying away of Persephone, a place of  fantasy, the oozy place of springs in the hollow of the hillside,  nowhere and everywhere, where the vine was \"invented.\"  The nymphs of  the trees overshadow it from above; the nymphs of the springs sustain  it from below--the Hyades, those first leaping maenads, who, as the  springs become rain-clouds, go up to heaven among the stars, and  descend again, as dew or shower, upon it; so that the religion of  Dionysus connects itself, not with tree-worship only, but also with  ancient water-worship, the worship of the spiritual forms of springs  and streams.  To escape from his enemies Dionysus leaps into the sea,  the original of all rain and springs, whence, in early summer, the  women of Elis and Argos were wont to call him, with the singing of a  hymn.  And again, in thus commemorating Dionysus as born of the dew,  the Greeks apprehend and embody the sentiment, the poetry, of water.  For not the heat only, but its solace--the freshness of the [28] cup-  -this too was felt by those people of the vineyard, whom the prophet  Melampus had taught to mix always their wine with water, and with  whom the watering of the vines became a religious ceremony; the very  dead, as they thought, drinking of and refreshed by the stream.  And  who that has ever felt the heat of a southern country does not know  this poetry, the motive of the loveliest of all the works attributed  to Giorgione, the Fête Champêtre in the Louvre; the intense  sensations, the subtle and far-reaching symbolisms, which, in these  places, cling about the touch and sound and sight of it?  Think of  the darkness of the well in the breathless court, with the delicate  ring of ferns kept alive just within the opening; of the sound of the  fresh water flowing through the wooden pipes into the houses of  Venice, on summer mornings; of the cry Acqua frésca! at Padua or  Verona, when the people run to buy what they prize, in its rare  purity, more than wine, bringing pleasures so full of exquisite  appeal to the imagination, that, in these streets, the very beggars,  one thinks, might exhaust all the philosophy of the epicurean.    Out of all these fancies comes the vine-growers' god, the spiritual  form of fire and dew.  Beyond the famous representations of Dionysus  in later art and poetry--the Bacchanals of Euripides, the statuary of  the school of Praxiteles--a multitude of literary allusions and local  [29] customs carry us back to this world of vision unchecked by  positive knowledge, in which the myth is begotten among a primitive  people, as they wondered over the life of the thing their hands  helped forward, till it became for them a kind of spirit, and their  culture of it a kind of worship.  Dionysus, as we see him in art and  poetry, is the projected expression of the ways and dreams of this  primitive people, brooded over and harmonised by the energetic Greek  imagination; the religious imagination of the Greeks being,  precisely, a unifying or identifying power, bringing together things  naturally asunder, making, as it were, for the human body a soul of  waters, for the human soul a body of flowers; welding into something  like the identity of a human personality the whole range of man's  experiences of a given object, or series of objects--all their  outward qualities, and the visible facts regarding them--all the  hidden ordinances by which those facts and qualities hold of unseen  forces, and have their roots in purely visionary places.    Dionysus came later than the other gods to the centres of Greek life;  and, as a consequence of this, he is presented to us in an earlier  stage of development than they; that element of natural fact which is  the original essence of all mythology being more unmistakeably  impressed upon us here than in other myths.  Not the least  interesting point in the study of him is, that he illustrates very  clearly, not only the [30] earlier, but also a certain later  influence of this element of natural fact, in the development of the  gods of Greece.  For the physical sense, latent in it, is the clue,  not merely to the original signification of the incidents of the  divine story, but also to the source of the peculiar imaginative  expression which its persons subsequently retain, in the forms of the  higher Greek sculpture.  And this leads me to some general thoughts  on the relation of Greek sculpture to mythology, which may help to  explain what the function of the imagination in Greek sculpture  really was, in its handling of divine persons.    That Zeus is, in earliest, original, primitive intention, the open  sky, across which the thunder sometimes sounds, and from which the  rain descends--is a fact which not only explains the various stories  related concerning him, but determines also the expression which he  retained in the work of Pheidias, so far as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4042"],[0,"Mozart: The Man and the Artist, as Revealed in His Own Words (#4)"],[1,"\"    (Paris, July 31, 1778, to his father.)    26. \"Do you imagine that I would write an opera comique in the  same manner as an opera seria? There must be as little learning  and seriousness in an opera buffa as there must be much of these  elements in an opera seria; but all the more of playfulness and  merriment. I am not responsible for the fact that there is a  desire also to hear comic music in an opera seria; the difference  is sharply drawn here. I find that the buffoon has not been  banished from music, and in this respect the French are right.\"    (Vienna, June 16, 1781, to his father. Mozart draws the line of  demarcation sharply between tragedy and comedy in opera.  [\"Shakespeare has taught us to accept an infusion of the comic  element in plays of a serious cast; but Shakespeare was an  innovator, a Romanticist, and, measured by old standards, his  dramas are irregular. The Italians, who followed classic models,  for a reason amply explained by the genesis of the art-form,  rigorously excluded comedy from serious operas, except as  intermezzi, until they hit upon a third classification, which  they called opera semiseria, in which a serious subject was  enlivened with comic episodes. Our dramatic tastes being grounded  in Shakespeare, we should be inclined to put down 'Don Giovanni'  as a musical tragedy; or, haunted by the Italian terminology, as  opera semiseria; but Mozart calls it opera buffa, more in  deference to the librettist's work, I fancy, than his own.\"--\"How  to Listen to Music,\" page 221. H.E.K.])    27. \"In opera, willy-nilly, poetry must be the obedient daughter  of music. Why do Italian operas please everywhere, even in Paris,  as I have been a witness, despite the wretchedness of their  librettos? Because in them music rules and compels us to forget  everything else. All the more must an opera please in which the  plot is well carried out, and the words are written simply for  the sake of the music and not here and there to please some  miserable rhyme, which, God knows, adds nothing to a theatrical  representation but more often harms it. Verses are the most  indispensable thing in music, but rhymes, for the sake of rhymes,  the most injurious. Those who go to work so pedantically will  assuredly come to grief along with the music. It were best if a  good composer, who understands the stage, and is himself able to  suggest something, and a clever poet could be united in one, like  a phoenix. Again, one must not fear the applause of the  unknowing.\"    (Vienna, October 13, 1781, to his father. The utterance is  notable as showing Mozart's belief touching the relationship  between text and music; he places himself in opposition to Gluck  whose ideas were at a later day accepted by Wagner. [\"It was my  intention to confine music to its true dramatic province, of  assisting poetical expression, and of augmenting the interest of  the fable, without interrupting the action, or chilling it with  useless and superfluous ornaments; for the office of music, when  joined to poetry, seemed to me to resemble that of coloring in a  correct and well disposed design, where the lights and shades  only seem to animate the figures without altering the outline.\"  Gluck in his dedication of \"Alceste\" to the Grand Duke of  Tuscany. \"The error in the genre of opera consists herein, that a  means of expression (music) has been made the end, while the end  of expression (the drama) has been made a means.\" Wagner, \"Opera  and Drama.\" H.E.K.])    28. \"Nota bene, what has always seemed unnatural in an aria are  the asides. In speech one can easily and quickly throw in a few  words in an aside; but in an aria, in which the words must be  repeated, the effect is bad.\"    (Munich, November 8, 1780, to his father. Mozart had been invited  to Munich to compose an opera, \"Idomeneo, Re di Creta,\" for the  carnival of 1781. [In contradistinction to the observations  touching poetry and music in the preceding paragraph, this remark  shows that he nevertheless had a sense of dramatic propriety. He  accepted the form as he found it, but protested against the  things which stood in the way of its vitalization. H.E.K.])    29. \"The second duet will be cut out entirely--more for the good  than the harm of the opera. You shall see for yourself, if you  read over the scene, that it would be weakened and cooled by an  aria or duet, which, moreover, would be extremely annoying to the  other actors who would have to stand around with nothing to do;  besides the magnanimous contest between 'Ilia' and 'Idamante'  would become too long and therefore lose in value.\"    (Munich, November 13, 1780, to his father. The reference is to  the opera \"Idomeneo.\")    30. \"It will be better to write a recitative under which the  instruments can do some good work; for in this scene, which is to  be the best in the whole opera, there will be so much noise and  confusion on the stage that an aria would cut but a sorry figure.  Moreover there will be a thunder-storm which is not likely to  cease out of respect for an aria, and the effect of a recitative  between two choruses will be incomparably better.\"    (Munich, November 15, to his father. Mozart was at work on  \"Idomeneo.\")    31. \"Don't you think that the speech of the subterranean voice  is too long? Think it over, carefully. Imagine the scene on the  stage. The voice must be terrifying--it must be impressive, one  must believe it real. How can this be so if the speech is too  long--the length itself convincing the listener of the  fictitiousness of the scene? If the speech of the 'Ghost' in  'Hamlet' were not so long it would be more effective.\"    (Vienna, November 29, 1780, to his father, who had made the  following suggestions respecting the opera \"Idomeneo.\" \"Idamante  and Ilia have a short quarrel (near the close of the opera) in a  few words of recitative which is interrupted by a subterranean  noise, whereupon the oracle speaks also from the depths. The  voice and the accompaniment must be moving, terrifying and most  extraordinary; it ought to make a masterpiece of harmony.\")    32. \"In a word: far-fetched or unusual words are always out of  place in an agreeable aria; moreover, I should like to have the  aria suggest only restfulness and satisfaction; and if it  consisted of only one part I should still be satisfied--in fact,  I should prefer to have it so.\"    (Munich, December 5, 1780, to his father. \"Idomeneo\" is still the  subject of discussion.)    33. \"As to the matter of popularity, be unconcerned; there is  music in my opera for all sorts of persons--but none for long  ears.\"    (Munich, December 16, 1780, to his father, who had expressed a  fear that Mozart would not write down to the level of his public.  [On December 11, his father had written: \"I recommend you not to  think in your work only of the musical public, but also of the  unmusical. You know that there are a hundred ignorant people for  every ten true connoisseurs; so do not forget what is called  popular and tickle the long ears.\" H.E.K.])    34. \"I have had a good deal of trouble with him about the  quartet. The oftener I fancy it performed on the stage the more  effective it seems to me; and it has pleased all who have heard  it on the pianoforte. Raaff alone thinks it will make no effect.  He said to me in private: 'Non c'e da spianar la voce--it is too  curt.' As if we should not speak more than we sing in a quartet!  He has no understanding of such things. I said to him simply:  'My dear friend, if I knew a single note which might be changed  in this quartet I would change it at once; but I have not been  so completely satisfied with anything in the opera as I am with  this quartet; when you have heard it sung together you will talk  differently. I have done my best to fit you with the two arias,  will do it again with the third, and hope to succeed; but you  must let the composer have his own way in trios and quartets.'  Whereupon he was satisfied. Recently he was vexed because of one  of the words in his best aria--'rinvigorir' and 'ringiovenir,'  particularly 'vienmi a rinvigorir'--five i's. It is true it  is very unpleasant at the conclusion of an aria.\"    (Munich, December 27, 1780, to his father. Raaff was the  principal singer in the opera \"Idomeneo,\" which Mozart had been  commissioned to write by the Elector for Munich. The observation  shows how capable Mozart was of appreciating foreign criticism.)    35. \"My head and hands are so full of the third act that it would  not be strange if I were myself transformed into a third act. It  has cost me more care than an entire opera, for there is scarcely  a scene in it which is not interesting. The accompaniment for the  subterranean voice consists of five voices only--three trombones  and two French-horns, which are placed at the point from which  the voice proceeds. At this moment the whole orchestra is  silent.\"    (Munich, January 3, 1781, to his father, whom in the same letter  he invites to Munich to hear the opera.)    36. \"After the chorus of mourning the King, the populace,  everybody, leave the stage, and the next scene begins with the  directions: 'Idomeneo in ginochione nel tempio (Idomeneus,  kneeling in the temple).' That will never do; he must come with  all his following. That necessitates a march, and I have composed  a very simple one for two violins, viola, bass and two oboes,  which is to be played a mezza voce, during which the King enters  and the priests make the preparations for the sacrifice. Then the  King sinks on his knees and begins his prayer. In Electra's  recitative, after the subterranean voice, the word 'Partono (they  go)' should be written in; I forgot to look at the copy made for  the printer and do not know whether or how the direction has been  written in. It seems silly to me that everybody should hurry away  only in order to leave Mademoiselle Electra alone.\"    (Munich, January 3, 1781, to his father.)  "]]]
