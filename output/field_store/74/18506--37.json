The energy of our  BRAINS is sadly dependent on the behaviour of our BOWELS.[20-*] Those  who say, 'Tis no matter what we eat or what we drink, may as well say,  'Tis no matter whether we eat, or whether we drink.    The following anecdotes I copy from Boswell's life of Johnson.    _Johnson._--\"I could write a better book of cookery than has ever yet  been written; it should be a book on philosophical principles. I would  tell what is the best butcher's meat, the proper seasons of different  vegetables, and then, how to roast, and boil, and to compound.\"    _Dilly._--\"_Mrs. Glasse's cookery_, which is the best, was written by  Dr. Hill.\"    _Johnson._--\"Well, Sir--this shows how much better the subject of  cookery[20-+] may be treated by a philosopher;[20-++] but you shall see  what a book of cookery I shall make, and shall agree with Mr. Dilly for  the copyright.\"    _Miss Seward._--\"That would be Hercules with the distaff indeed!\"    _Johnson._--\"No, madam; women can spin very well, but they cannot make a  good book of cookery.\" See vol. iii. p. 311.    Mr. B. adds, \"I never knew a man who relished good eating more than he  did: when at table, he was totally absorbed in the business of the  moment: nor would he, unless in very high company, say one word, or even  pay the least attention to what was said by others, until he had  satisfied his appetite.\"    The peculiarities of his constitution were as great as those of his  character: luxury and intemperance are relative terms, depending on  other circumstances than mere quantity and quality. Nature gave him an  excellent palate, and a craving appetite, and his intense application  rendered large supplies of nourishment absolutely necessary to recruit  his exhausted spirits.    The fact is, this great man had found out that animal and intellectual  vigour,[21-*] are much more entirely dependent upon each other than is  commonly understood; especially in those constitutions whose digestive  and chylopoietic organs are capricious and easily put out of tune, or  absorb the \"_pabulum vitae_\" indolently and imperfectly: with such, it is  only now and then that the \"_sensorium commune_\" vibrates with the full  tone of accurately considerative, or creative energy. \"His favourite  dainties were, a leg of pork boiled till it dropped from the bone, a  veal-pie, with plums and sugar, or the outside cut of a salt buttock of  beef. With regard to _drink_, his liking was for the strongest, as it  was not the _flavour_, but the _effect_ that he desired.\" Mr. Smale's  Account of Dr. Johnson's Journey into Wales, 1816, p. 174.    Thus does the HEALTH always, and very often the LIFE of invalids, and  those who have weak and infirm STOMACHS, depend upon the care and skill  of the COOK. Our forefathers were so sensible of this, that in days of  yore no man of consequence thought of making a day's journey without  taking his \"MAGISTER COQUORUM\" with him.    The rarity of this talent in a high degree is so well understood, that  besides very considerable pecuniary compensation, his majesty's first  and second cooks[22-*] are now esquires by their office. We have every  reason to suppose they were persons of equal dignity heretofore.    In Dr. Pegge's \"Forme of Cury,\" 8vo. London, 1780, we read, that when  Cardinal Otto, the Pope's legate, was at Oxford, A. D. 1248, his brother  officiated as \"MAGISTER COQUINAE.\"    This important post has always been held as a situation of high trust  and confidence; and the \"MAGNUS COQUUS,\" Anglice, the _Master  Kitchener_, has, time immemorial, been an officer of considerable  dignity in the palaces of princes.    The cook in PLAUTUS (_pseudol_) is called \"_Hominum servatorem_,\" the  preserver of mankind; and by MERCIER \"_un medecin qui guerit  radicalement deux maladies mortelles, la faim et la soif_.\"    The Norman conqueror WILLIAM bestowed several portions of land on these  highly-favoured domestics, the \"COQUORUM PRAEPOSITUS,\" and \"COQUUS  REGIUS;\" a manor was bestowed on Robert Argyllon the \"GRAND QUEUX,\" to  be held by the following service. See that venerable record, the  doomsday book.    \"Robert Argyllon holdeth one carucate of land in Addington in the county  of Surrey, by the service of making one mess in an earthen pot in the  kitchen of our Lord the KING, on the day of his coronation, called _De  la Groute_,\" i. e. a kind of plum-porridge, or water-gruel with plums in  it. This dish is still served up at the royal table at coronations, by  the Lord of the said manor of Addington.    At the coronation of King George IV., Court of Claims, July 12, 1820:    \"The petition of the Archbishop of CANTERBURY, which was presented by  Sir G. Nayler, claiming to perform the service of presenting a dish of  _De la Groute_ to the King at the banquet, was considered by the Court,  and decided to be allowed.\"    A good dinner is one of the greatest enjoyments of human life; and  as the practice of cookery is attended with so many discouraging  difficulties,[22-+] so many disgusting and disagreeable circumstances,  and even dangers, we ought to have some regard for those who encounter  them to procure us pleasure, and to reward their attention by rendering  their situation every way as comfortable and agreeable as we can. He who  preaches _integrity_ to those in the kitchen, (see \"_Advice to Cooks_,\")  may be permitted to recommend _liberality_ to those in the parlour; they  are indeed the sources of each other. Depend upon it, \"True self-love  and social are the same;\" \"Do as you would be done by:\" give those you  are obliged to trust every inducement to be honest, and no temptation to  play tricks.    When you consider that a good servant eats[23-*] no more than a bad one,  how much waste is occasioned by provisions being dressed in a slovenly  and unskilful manner, and how much a good cook (to whom the conduct of  the kitchen is confided) can save you by careful management, no  housekeeper will hardly deem it an unwise speculation (it is certainly  an amiable experiment), to invite the _honesty_ and _industry_ of  domestics, by setting them an example of _liberality_--at least, show  them, that \"According to their pains will be their gains.\"    Avoid all approaches towards _familiarity_; which, to a proverb, is  accompanied by _contempt_, and soon breaks the neck of obedience.    A lady gave us the following account of the progress of a favourite.    \"The first year, she was an excellent servant; the second, a kind  mistress; the third, an intolerable tyrant; at whose dismissal, every  creature about my house rejoiced heartily.\"    However, servants are more likely to be praised into good conduct, than  scolded out of bad. Always commend them when they do right. To cherish  the desire of pleasing in them, you must show them that you are  pleased:--        \"Be to their faults a little blind,      And to their virtues very kind.\"    By such conduct, ordinary servants may be converted into good ones: few  are so hardened, as not to feel gratified when they are kindly and  liberally treated.    It is a good maxim to select servants not younger than THIRTY:--_before_  that age, however comfortable you may endeavour to make them, their want  of experience, and the _hope_ of something still _better_, prevents  their being satisfied with their present state; _after_, they have had  the benefit of experience: if they are tolerably comfortable, they will  endeavour to deserve the smiles of even a moderately kind master, for  _fear_ they may change for the _worse_.    Life may indeed be very fairly divided into the seasons of HOPE and  FEAR. In YOUTH, _we hope every thing may be right_: in AGE, _we fear  every thing will be wrong_.    Do not discharge a good servant for a slight offence:--        \"Bear and forbear, thus preached the stoic sages,      And in two words, include the sense of pages.\"--POPE.    HUMAN NATURE IS THE SAME IN ALL STATIONS: if you can convince your  servants that you have a generous and considerate regard for their  health and comfort, why should you imagine that they will be insensible  to the good they receive?    Impose no commands but what are reasonable, nor reprove but with justice  and temper: the best way to ensure which is, never to lecture them till  at least one day after they have offended you.    If they have any particular hardship to endure in your service, let them  see that you are concerned for the necessity of imposing it.    _If they are sick_, remember you are their patron as well as their  master: remit their labour, and give them all the assistance of food,  physic, and every comfort in your power. Tender assiduity about an  invalid is half a cure; it is a balsam to the mind, which has a most  powerful effect on the body, soothes the sharpest pains, and strengthens  beyond the richest cordial.    Ye who think that to protect and encourage virtue is the best preventive  from vice, reward your female servants liberally.    CHARITY SHOULD BEGIN AT HOME. Prevention is preferable to cure--but I  have no objection to see your names ornamenting the lists of subscribers  to foundling hospitals and female penitentiaries.[25-*] Gentle reader,  for a definition of the word \"_charity_,\" let me refer you to the 13th  Chapter of St. Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians.    \"To say nothing of the deleterious vapours and pestilential exhalations  of the charcoal, which soon undermine the health of the heartiest, the  glare of a scorching fire, and the smoke so baneful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28693"],[0,"Tales of the Fish Patrol (#4)"],[1,".    Several days passed after the visit of Big Alec, during which Charley  and I kept a sharp watch on him. He towed his ark around the Solano  Wharf and into the big bight at Turner's Shipyard. The bight we knew to  be good ground for sturgeon, and there we felt sure the King of the  Greeks intended to begin operations. The tide circled like a mill-race  in and out of this bight, and made it possible to raise, lower, or set  a Chinese line only at slack water. So between the tides Charley and I  made it a point for one or the other of us to keep a lookout from the  Solano Wharf.    On the fourth day I was lying in the sun behind the stringer-piece of  the wharf, when I saw a skiff leave the distant shore and pull out into  the bight. In an instant the glasses were at my eyes and I was  following every movement of the skiff. There were two men in it, and  though it was a good mile away, I made out one of them to be Big Alec;  and ere the skiff returned to shore I made out enough more to know that  the Greek had set his line.    \"Big Alec has a Chinese line out in the bight off Turner's Shipyard,\"  Charley Le Grant said that afternoon to Carmintel.    A fleeting expression of annoyance passed over the patrolman's face,  and then he said, \"Yes?\" in an absent way, and that was all.    Charley bit his lip with suppressed anger and turned on his heel.    \"Are you game, my lad?\" he said to me later on in the evening, just as  we finished washing down the _Reindeer's_ decks and were preparing to  turn in.    A lump came up in my throat, and I could only nod my head.    \"Well, then,\" and Charley's eyes glittered in a determined way, \"we've  got to capture Big Alec between us, you and I, and we've got to do it  in spite of Carmintel. Will you lend a hand?\"    \"It's a hard proposition, but we can do it,\" he added after a pause.    \"Of course we can,\" I supplemented enthusiastically.    And then he said, \"Of course we can,\" and we shook hands on it and went  to bed.    But it was no easy task we had set ourselves. In order to convict a man  of illegal fishing, it was necessary to catch him in the act with all  the evidence of the crime about him--the hooks, the lines, the fish,  and the man himself. This meant that we must take Big Alec on the open  water, where he could see us coming and prepare for us one of the warm  receptions for which he was noted.    \"There's no getting around it,\" Charley said one morning. \"If we can  only get alongside it's an even toss, and there's nothing left for us  but to try and get alongside. Come on, lad.\"    We were in the Columbia River salmon boat, the one we had used against  the Chinese shrimp-catchers. Slack water had come, and as we dropped  around the end of the Solano Wharf we saw Big Alec at work, running his  line and removing the fish.    \"Change places,\" Charley commanded, \"and steer just astern of him as  though you're going into the shipyard.\"    I took the tiller, and Charley sat down on a thwart amidships, placing  his revolver handily beside him.    \"If he begins to shoot,\" he cautioned, \"get down in the bottom and steer  from there, so that nothing more than your hand will be exposed.\"    I nodded, and we kept silent after that, the boat slipping gently  through the water and Big Alec growing nearer and nearer. We could see  him quite plainly, gaffing the sturgeon and throwing them into the boat  while his companion ran the line and cleared the hooks as he dropped  them back into the water. Nevertheless, we were five hundred yards away  when the big fisherman hailed us.    \"Here! You! What do you want?\" he shouted.    \"Keep going,\" Charley whispered, \"just as though you didn't hear him.\"    The next few moments were very anxious ones. The fisherman was studying  us sharply, while we were gliding up on him every second.    \"You keep off if you know what's good for you!\" he called out suddenly,  as though he had made up his mind as to who and what we were. \"If you  don't, I'll fix you!\"    He brought a rifle to his shoulder and trained it on me.    \"Now will you keep off?\" he demanded.    I could hear Charley groan with disappointment. \"Keep off,\" he  whispered; \"it's all up for this time.\"    I put up the tiller and eased the sheet, and the salmon boat ran off  five or six points. Big Alec watched us till we were out of range, when  he returned to his work.    \"You'd better leave Big Alec alone,\" Carmintel said, rather sourly, to  Charley that night.    \"So he's been complaining to you, has he?\" Charley said significantly.    Carmintel flushed painfully. \"You'd better leave him alone, I tell you,\"  he repeated. \"He's a dangerous man, and it won't pay to fool with him.\"    \"Yes,\" Charley answered softly; \"I've heard that it pays better to leave  him alone.\"    This was a direct thrust at Carmintel, and we could see by the  expression of his face that it sank home. For it was common knowledge  that Big Alec was as willing to bribe as to fight, and that of late  years more than one patrolman had handled the fisherman's money.    \"Do you mean to say--\" Carmintel began, in a bullying tone.    But Charley cut him off shortly. \"I mean to say nothing,\" he said. \"You  heard what I said, and if the cap fits, why--\"    He shrugged his shoulders, and Carmintel glowered at him, speechless.    \"What we want is imagination,\" Charley said to me one day, when we had  attempted to creep upon Big Alec in the gray of dawn and had been shot  at for our trouble.    And thereafter, and for many days, I cudgelled my brains trying to  imagine some possible way by which two men, on an open stretch of water,  could capture another who knew how to use a rifle and was never to be  found without one. Regularly, every slack water, without slyness,  boldly and openly in the broad day, Big Alec was to be seen running his  line. And what made it particularly exasperating was the fact that  every fisherman, from Benicia to Vallejo, knew that he was successfully  defying us. Carmintel also bothered us, for he kept us busy among the  shad-fishers of San Pablo, so that we had little time to spare on the  King of the Greeks. But Charley's wife and children lived at Benicia,  and we had made the place our headquarters, so that we always returned  to it.    \"I'll tell you what we can do,\" I said, after several fruitless weeks  had passed; \"we can wait some slack water till Big Alec has run his  line and gone ashore with the fish, and then we can go out and capture  the line. It will put him to time and expense to make another, and then  we'll figure to capture that too. If we can't capture him, we can  discourage him, you see.\"    Charley saw, and said it wasn't a bad idea. We watched our chance, and  the next low-water slack, after Big Alec had removed the fish from the  line and returned ashore, we went out in the salmon boat. We had the  bearings of the line from shore marks, and we knew we would have no  difficulty in locating it. The first of the flood tide was setting in,  when we ran below where we thought the line was stretched and dropped  over a fishing-boat anchor. Keeping a short rope to the anchor, so that  it barely touched the bottom, we dragged it slowly along until it stuck  and the boat fetched up hard and fast.    \"We've got it,\" Charley cried. \"Come on and lend a hand to get it in.\"    Together we hove up the rope till the anchor came in sight with the  sturgeon line caught across one of the flukes. Scores of the  murderous-looking hooks flashed into sight as we cleared the anchor,  and we had just started to run along the line to the end where we could  begin to lift it, when a sharp thud in the boat startled us. We looked  about, but saw nothing and returned to our work. An instant later there  was a similar sharp thud and the gunwale splintered between Charley's  body and mine.    \"That's remarkably like a bullet, lad,\" he said reflectively. \"And it's  a long shot Big Alec's making.\"    \"And he's using smokeless powder,\" he concluded, after an examination of  the mile-distant shore. \"That's why we can't hear the report.\"    I looked at the shore, but could see no sign of Big Alec, who was  undoubtedly hidden in some rocky nook with us at his mercy. A third  bullet struck the water, glanced, passed singing over our heads, and  struck the water again beyond.    \"I guess we'd better get out of this,\" Charley remarked coolly. \"What  do you think, lad?\"    I thought so, too, and said we didn't want the line anyway. Whereupon  we cast off and hoisted the spritsail. The bullets ceased at once, and  we sailed away, unpleasantly confident that Big Alec was laughing at our  discomfiture.    And more than that, the next day on the fishing wharf, where we were  inspecting nets, he saw fit to laugh and sneer at us, and this before  all the fishermen. Charley's face went black with anger; but beyond  promising Big Alec that in the end he would surely land him behind the  bars, he controlled himself and said nothing. The King of the Greeks  made his boast that no fish patrol had ever taken him or ever could  take him, and the fishermen cheered him and said it was true. They grew  excited, and it looked like trouble for a while; but Big Alec asserted  his kingship and quelled them.    Carmintel also laughed at Charley, and dropped sarcastic remarks, and  made it hard for him. But Charley refused to be angered, though he told  me in confidence that he intended to capture Big Alec if it took all the  rest of his life to accomplish it.    \"I don't know how I'll do it,\" he said, \"but do it I will, as sure as I  am Charley Le Grant. The idea will come to me at the right and proper  time, never fear.\"    And at the right time it came, and most unexpectedly. Fully a month had  passed, and we were constantly up and down the river, and down and up  the bay, with no spare moments to devote to the particular fisherman  who ran a Chinese line in the bight of Turner's Shipyard.
