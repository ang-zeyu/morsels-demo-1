The men didn't bring back much game; each had left a share with Mrs.  Sanders.    Next morning we were astir early. We pulled out of camp just as the  first level rays of the sun shot across the desolate, flat country. We  crossed the flat little stream with its soft sandy banks. A willow  here and there along the bank and the blue, distant mountains and some  lonesome buttes were all there was to break the monotony. Yet we saw  some prosperous-looking places with many haystacks. I looked back once  toward the Sanders cabin. The blue smoke was just beginning to curl  upward from the stove pipe. The green spot looked vividly green  against the dim prospect. Poor pa and poor ma! Even if they could be  _nothing_ more, I wish at least that they need not have given up Nick  and Fan!

IV    CRAZY OLAF AND OTHERS                                    IN CAMP, August 31, 1914.    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    We are across the desert, and camped for a few days' fishing on a  shady, bowery little stream. We have had two frosty nights and there  are trembling golden groves on every hand. Four men joined us at  Newfork, and the bachelors have gone on; but Mr. Stewart wanted to  rest the \"beasties\" and we all wanted to fish, so we camped for a day  or two.    The twenty-eighth was the warmest day we have had, the most  disagreeable in every way. Not a breath of air stirred except an  occasional whirlwind, which was hot and threw sand and dust over us.  We could see the heat glimmering, and not a tree nor a green spot. The  mountains looked no nearer. I am afraid we _all_ rather wished we  were at home. Water was getting very scarce, so the men wanted to  reach by noon a long, low valley they knew of; for sometimes water  could be found in a buried river-bed there, and they hoped to find  enough for the horses. But a little after noon we came to the spot,  and only dry, glistening sand met our eyes. The men emptied the  water-bags for the horses; they all had a little water. We had to be  saving, so none of us washed our dust-grimed faces.    We were sitting in the scant shadow of the wagons eating our dinner  when we were startled to see a tall, bare-headed man come racing  down the draw. His clothes and shoes were in tatters; there were  great blisters on his arms and shoulders where the sun had burned  him; his eyes were swollen and red, and his lips were cracked and  bloody. His hair was so white and so dusty that altogether he was a  pitiful-looking object. He greeted us pleasantly, and said that his  name was Olaf Swanson and that he was a sheep-herder; that he had  seen us and had come to ask for a little smoking. By that he meant  tobacco.    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy was eyeing him very closely. She asked him when he  had eaten. That morning, he said. She asked him _what_ he had eaten;  he told her cactus balls and a little rabbit. I saw her exchange  glances with Professor Glenholdt, and she left her dinner to get out  her war-bag.    She called Olaf aside and gently dressed his blisters with listerine;  after she had helped him to clean his mouth she said to him, \"Now,  Olaf, sit by me and eat; show me how much you can eat. Then tell me  what you mean by saying you are a sheep-herder; don't you think we  know there will be no sheep on the desert before there is snow to make  water for them?\"    \"I am what I say I am,\" he said. \"I am not herding now because sorrow  has drove me to dig wells. It is sorrow for horses. Have you not seen  their bones every mile or so along this road? Them's markers. Every  pile of bones marks where man's most faithful friend has laid down at  last: most of 'em died in the harness and for want of water.    \"I killed a horse once. I was trying to have a good time. I had been  out with sheep for months and hadn't seen any one but my pardner. We  planned to have a rippin' good time when we took the sheep in off the  summer range and drew our pay. You don't know how people-hungry a man  gets livin' out. So my pardner and me layed out to have one spree. We  had a neat little bunch of money, but when we got to town we felt lost  as sheep. We didn't know nobody but the bartender. We kept taking a  drink now and then just so as to have him to talk to. Finally, he told  us there was going to be a dance that night, so we asked around and  found we could get tickets for two dollars each. Sam said he'd like to  go. We bought tickets.    \"Somehow or another they knew us for sheep-herders, and every once in  a while somebody would _baa-baa_ at us. We had a couple of dances, but  after that we couldn't get a pardner. After midnight things begun to  get pretty noisy. Sam and me was settin' wonderin' if we were havin' a  good time, when a fellow stepped on Sam's foot and said _baa_. I rose  up and was goin' to smash him, but Sam collared me and said, 'Let's  get away from here, Olaf, before trouble breaks out.' It sounded as if  every man in the house and some of the women were _baa_-ing.    \"We were pretty near the door when a man put his hand to his nose and  _baa_-ed. I knocked him down, and before you could bat your eye  everybody was fightin'. We couldn't get out, so we backed into a  corner; and every man my fist hit rested on the floor till somebody  helped him away. A fellow hit me on the head with a chair and I didn't  know how I finished or got out.    \"The first thing I remember after that was feeling the greasewood  thorns tearing my flesh and my clothes next day. We were away out on  the desert not far from North Pilot butte. Poor Sam couldn't speak. I  got him off poor old Pinto, and took off the saddle for a pillow for  him. I hung the saddle-blanket on a greasewood so as to shade his  face; then I got on my own poor horse, poor old Billy, and started to  hunt help. I rode and rode. I was tryin' to find some outfit. When  Billy lagged I beat him on. You see, I was thinking of Sam. After a  while the horse staggered,--stepped into a badger hole, I thought. But  he kept staggerin'. I fell off on one side just as he pitched forward.  He tried and tried to get up. I stayed till he died; then I kept  walking. I don't know what became of Sam; I don't know what became of  me; but I do know I am going to dig wells all over this desert until  every thirsty horse can have water.\"    All the time he had been eating just pickles; when he finished his  story he ate faster. By now we all knew he was demented. The men tried  to coax him to go on with us so that they could turn him over to the  authorities, but he said he must be digging. At last it was decided to  send some one back for him. Mr. Struble was unwilling to leave him,  but the man would not be persuaded. Suddenly he gathered up his  \"smoking\" and some food and ran back up the draw. We had to go on, of  course.    All that afternoon our road lay along the buried river. I don't mean  dry river. Sand had blown into the river until the water was buried.  Water was only a few feet down, and the banks were clearly defined.  Sometimes we came to a small, dirty puddle, but it was so alkaline  that nothing could drink it. The story we had heard had saddened us  all, and we were sorry for our horses. Poor little Elizabeth Hull  wept. She said the West was so big and bare, and she was so alone and  so sad, she just _had_ to cry.    About sundown we came to a ranch and were made welcome by one Timothy  Hobbs, owner of the place. The dwelling and the stables were a  collection of low brown houses, made of logs and daubed with mud.  Fields of shocked grain made a very prosperous-looking background. A  belled cow led a bunch of sleek cattle home over the sand dunes. A  well in the yard afforded plenty of clear, cold water, which was  raised by a windmill. The cattle came and drank at the trough, the  bell making a pleasant sound in the twilight.    The men told Mr. Hobbs about the man we saw. \"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"that  is Crazy Olaf. He has been that way for twenty years. Spends his time  digging wells, but he never gets any water, and the sand caves in  almost as fast as he can get it out.\" Then he launched upon a recital  of how he got sweet water by piping past the alkali strata. I kept  hoping he would tell how Olaf was kept and who was responsible for  him, but he never told.    He invited us to prepare our supper in his kitchen, and as it was late  and wood was scarce, we were glad to accept. He bustled about helping  us, adding such dainties as fresh milk, butter, and eggs to our menu.  He is a rather stout little man, with merry gray eyes and brown hair  beginning to gray. He wore a red shirt and blue overalls, and he wiped  his butcher's knife impartially on the legs of his overalls or his  towel,--just whichever was handiest as he hurried about cutting our  bacon and opening cans for us.    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and he got on famously. After supper, while she and  Elizabeth washed the dishes, she asked him why he didn't get married  and have some one to look after him and his cabin.

The Romans allowed a great many  religious systems to exist, but they allowed no such thing as a religion  destructive of the genius of paganism. The existing religions were many,  and embraced the system of many gods ruling under one \"Master God,\" as  \"his members,\" or representatives. The antagonism between Paganism and  Christianity may be seen at once, in the fact that the Gospel of Christ  was death to all the lower gods. On this account the first Christians  became at once the object of national hatred and scorn. This accounts for  the fact that bloody Rome baptized herself in Christian blood in spite of  all her tolerance of religion.    The apostle met with sufferings on all sides; and having perfect liberty  of recantation at any moment, how did it come to pass, if he was  insincere, that he did not recant? Was he rational? Let his writing  answer! They are admired by the best minds of earth. If he was irrational,  let us have many more insane writers! Was he honest? If not, who is  honest? Could he be deceived about the facts which he saw and heard? No!  If he was, who can't be? He could not be mistaken, for he _saw_, and  _heard_, and _felt_--even to _blindness_, and, also, to the receiving of  his sight. He was sincere. He suffered long as a bold defender of the  Christian religion, and died a martyr's death at last. Let us work on,  suffer on, hope on, \"hope in death,\" and live forever! So mote it be.            \"BROAD-GAUGE RELIGION.\"--SHALL THE CONFLICT CEASE?      First. \"A portion of the Church of England, comprising those who claim to  hold a position, in respect to doctrine and fellowship, intermediate  between the old High Church party and the modern Low Church, or  evangelical party, a term of recent origin,\" having originated in the last  half century, \"which has been loosely applied to other bodies of men  holding liberal or comprehensive views of Christian doctrine and  fellowship.\"--_Webster._    Side by side with these various shades of High and Low Church, another  party of a different character has always existed in the Church of  England. It is called by different names: Moderate, Catholic, or _Broad  Church_, by its friends: Latitudinarian or Indifferent, by its enemies.  Its distinctive character is the desire of comprehension. Its watchwords  are _charity_ and _toleration_.--_Conybeare._    _Broadgauge._ This word is connected, in its origin, with railroads. Its  radical idea is that of distance. It is credited by Webster to Simmonds in  these words, \"A wide distance (usually six or seven feet) between the  rails on a railway, in contradistinction from the narrow gauge of four  feet eight inches and a half.\" The watch-word, \"charity,\" is a term that  has been much abused. \"Charity is a grace of heavenly mien.\" It is the  \"end of the commandment.\" \"The law was not made for a righteous man, but  for the lawless, and the disobedient, etc.\" It is love, in the New  Testament sense of the term, as modified by all the essential elements of  the Christian religion, so it is \"the fulfilling of the law.\" It is not  passion, _but affection_. To my sensuous life all my passions belong. The  brute has also a sensuous life. But man has, in addition to this, an  intellectual life. Passion always passes away with its object, but  affection remains to soften the heart years after its object is gone.    My intellectual nature is the field of all legitimate gospel operations  with reference to the production of a Christian life and character. As a  divine affection, charity or love springs out of union with God, or being  made a \"partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that  is in the world through lusts.\" Such being the height of its bed-rock, it  is said, \"Every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.\" And it is  also said, \"He that saith I know him and keepeth not his commandments is a  liar.\" This strong language correlates with the fact that charity  expresses the idea of love as an attribute of divine life, known as the  life of God. It is an attribute belonging to those who have made the high  attainment of a spiritual or mental condition which places them beyond the  need of penal laws to restrain them from crime. Its _measure_ is the _love  of God_. Its full import may be expressed in these words, _loving as God  loves_.    After enumerating many of the Christian graces an apostle said, Above all  these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. So charity,  or rather its possessor, is no willful truth \"butcherer,\" for charity  believeth all things (_or all truth_); hopeth all things (_promised_);  rejoiceth, not in iniquity, but in the truth. It has no \"stock\" in known  error, for it \"abounds in all knowledge and judgment,\" and \"approves  things that are excellent.\" It is noble and right to let \"love,\" or  \"charity have her perfect work,\" to be, or rather try to be, as charitable  as God himself; but it is absurd and preposterous to go beyond or try to  be more charitable. \"It is enough that the disciple be _as his master_.\"    Men are guilty of this presumption when they, in feigned charity, go  beyond the word of the Lord, or beyond the truth in their expressions of  kindness.    There is a great deal of love in this world that lacks the elements of  _perfectness_. It is not the \"love of God,\" or loving as God loves. It is  not the attribute of a divine life. There is no charity in influencing a  person, willfully, to stop short or go beyond the truth in Christian faith  or obedience. There is no charity in giving a man money knowingly to  purchase whisky to get drunk upon. Charity never conflicts with truth or  right. On the contrary, it endeavors to bring all men to the standard of  truth and rectitude.    The phrase \"Broad-gauge\" seems to have been gotten up to express the idea  of an intelligent relaxation from \"human creeds\" as bonds of union and  fellowship. In this sense we all ought to be the advocates of \"Broad-gauge  religion.\" We should cultivate the spirit of gospel liberality until we  utterly disregard and put away all human creeds.    It is a trite saying, that one extreme begets another; against this error  we should guard with great caution. To succeed in religion, we must  remember, always, that we have in the word of God a standard of truth and  right that will always govern us according to heaven's will. Many persons,  forgetting this truth, have been led to conclude that departures from the  word of truth, as a matter of \"liberality,\" or \"broad-gauge religion,\" are  justifiable. And, as \"liberalists,\" or \"broad-gauge Christians,\" they are  disposed to recognize all the existing divisions in faith and practice  that are known in Christendom. They even go further and allow that somehow  all are right, and will stand upon an equality in the righteous judgement  of God. This is not perfect love. Charity, over and above a kindly feeling  towards those who are in error, is unfaithfulness to the truth, to God,  and to the very best interests of our humanity. It is, in all such cases,  _love run mad_! A man should never get so broad in his religion as to be  unfaithful to truth.    The phraseology has also been appropriated by skeptics and semi-infidels  to popularize their own semi-infidel philosophy, which they love to  denominate \"free thought.\" Deists, Pantheists and Atheists have seized  upon the phrase and appropriated it to their ungodly speculations. It is  true that others, in getting away from their old creeds, have run past the  standard of truth and right. All this wildness in the _standardless_ field  of thought, where Hobbes and other infidels reveled, without any guide  save the civil law, has been denominated \"Broad-gauge religion,\" and  \"Liberalism.\"    We should always remember that going beyond the truth and the eternal laws  of right is _libertinism_ or _lawlessness_.    \"Charity,\" extending, or reaching out thus, is no longer \"charity,\" or  \"perfect love.\" Such expressions of love are misdirected, and, if  knowingly done, are blameworthy. Charity is governed by the perfect law of  truth; when it is not destitute of its own divine nature it conducts us in  the \"_straight and narrow way_.\"          \"Long as of life the joyous hours remain,      Let on this head unfading flowers reside,      There bloom the vernal rose's earliest pride;      And when, our flames commissioned to destroy,      Age step 'twixt Love and me, and intercept the joy;      When my changed these locks no more shall know,      And all its petty honors turn to snow;      Then let me rightly spell of Nature's ways;      To Providence, to him my thoughts I'd raise,      And love as he throughout remaining days.\"        --_Gray._      We should cherish a kind feeling for all our fellows, and in doing this we  should not forget our duty to point them to truth in word and example, to  be ever faithful to truth.    There are two great fields of thought for the exercise of the Christian  intellect of the present times. One is the corruptions of Roman Catholic  religion, and the other is the corruptions of Protestant religions.    That both are great feeder-dams to infidelity and skepticism is  demonstrated by the infidel productions of the day. The dogma of  ecclesiastic authority set up in opposition to reason and scientific  discovery is the _infidel's devil_, and a very poor devil at that. For,  when the Pope has interfered to settle a question it has often happened  that his decisions were wrong.    On March 5, 1616, the congregation of the Index published a decree  condemning as \"false, unscriptural and destructive of Catholic truth,\" the  opinion that the earth moves round the sun. It is denied by Roman  theologians that Paul IV., who set the Index at work and agreed with its  decisions, was responsible for this decree, but the preponderance of  evidence is against them. It is known that this Pope presided in a  congregation of "]]]
