Did these do more  than animated intelligence can do? Gentlemen of skeptical proclivities  answer.    If so, is this not evolution backwards? Is it not retrogression, or  development at the expense of the loss of power to rise to the plane of  unintelligent mind and life evolving nature? Do you say, organic life  does evolve organic life and mind. From a state of death? Without  antecedent life and mind being drawn upon? Come, gentlemen; how is this?  You say inanimate Nature produced life and mind without the previous  existence of either; can you duplicate that feat with your power? If you  can't are you not below the inanimate Nature which did it for the first  time? Can inanimate forces do more than living intelligent Nature? Do  you say no! Then demonstrate the philosophy of spontaneous generation of  life, and show yourself A GOD.    An effort to produce organic life without antecedent life, or where it  is not, is an effort to create organic life. The efforts of unbelievers  to produce organic life by spontaneous generation, is an effort to  produce organic life where it is not. Therefore the efforts of  unbelievers to produce organic life, by spontaneous generation, is an  effort to create organic life.    An effort to create organic life where it is not is an effort to rise  into the character of a God, and show one's self the equal of God. But  why should this effort not be made? If unintelligent dead matter has  performed the feat, without wisdom or design, why should it not be  performed by living intelligent Nature? Gentlemen, demonstrate your  theory. Do you say, we have given up all hope of witnessing its  demonstration? Well, well, has any man ever witnessed it? You say no.  Then it is not certain knowledge. Science is certain knowledge.  Therefore spontaneous generation of life and intelligent being is not  science. Now, gentlemen, don't prostitute science at the shrine of your  nonsensical guessing any more. Throw your guessing to one side and  acknowledge God like wise men, and be no longer foolish.    Do you say life was always in matter? \"Then we must conclude that it is  in matter in the same sense in which all other corporeal qualities are  in bodies, so as to be divisible together with it, and some of it be in  every part of the matter.\" This is ancient Hylozoism.    On the other hand, the \"Stoical Atheists supposed there was one life  only in the entire mass of matter, after such a manner, as that none of  the parts of it by themselves should have any life of their own.\" Now,  according to this Stoical theory, \"life is no corporeal quality or form,  but an incorporeal substance.\" There are, really, but two sorts of  Atheism which have been in any thing like extensive notice. First, \"Such  as claim that life is essential to matter, and therefore _ingenerable_  and _incorruptible_.\" Second, \"Those who claim that life and everything,  besides the bare substance of matter, or extended bulk, is merely  accidental, generable, or corruptible, rising out of some mixture or  modification of matter.\" Is life, perception and understanding  essential to matter, as such? Is senseless matter perfectly wise,  without consciousness? Such is Hylozoism, and it is outrageous nonsense.  Very few men ever had credulity enough to receive and appropriate it.  This form of Atheism was a forlorn and abandoned thing, without form or  systemization, for centuries gone by--and it has few--very  few--votaries, even now. The second kind of Atheism \"is that of a true  notion of body, that it is nothing but resisting bulk,\" associated with  atomic physiology, which is an old theory resurrected of late, and  displayed anew, with a _show_ of deep philosophy and wisdom. But that  mind and understanding itself sprang from senseless nature and chance,  as a mere accident, or from the unguided and undirected motions of  matter, is also nonsensical, and utterly absurd. Were there infinite  atoms in mutual encounters, dashing and striking against each other? Did  these atoms, devoid of sense and life, with their reflections and  repurcussions, their cohesions, implexions, and entanglements, their  scattered dispersions and divulsions, produce life and intelligence? If  so, we will call it by the name of chance. Hear this, O, ye scientists,  there is but one choice, and that is between _God_ and _chance_!    The chance theory is that \"infinite atoms of various sizes and figures,  devoid of life and sense, moving fortuitously from eternity in infinite  space, and making successive encounters and various implexions and  entanglements with one another, produced first a confused chaos of these  omnifarious particles or atoms, which, jumbling together with infinite  variety of motions by the tugging of their different and contrary  forces, hindered and restricted each other until, by joint conspiracy,  they conglomerated into a vortex or vortexes, where, after many  convulsions and evolutions, molitions and essays, in which all manner of  tricks were tried,\" without design, \"they _chanced_ in length of time to  settle into the form and system of things known as earth, air and fire,  sun, moon and stars, plants, animals and men;\" so that senseless atoms  unconsciously moved themselves, although dead as grains of sand, and  kept up the motion until, without any _living substance_ underlying, and  adequate to produce motion, all things so beautifully arranged sprang  into life and being. O, ye stars, what is the magnitude of an infidel's  credulity? What is there which he can not believe? It is no longer to be  set down that he is a reasonable man. \"The fool saith in his heart there  is no God.\" There is a grand relation between the eternal spirit and  that eternal substance which lies behind and underneath all that is, and  that relation is the relation between the \"King Eternal\" and that over  which he presides and which he controls. So out of nothing nothing  comes.          RELIGIOUS HYSTERIA, OR GETTING INSTANTANEOUSLY CONVERTED.    BY GEORGE HERBERT CURTEIS, M.A.,    _Late Fellow and Sub-Rector of Exeter College, Principal of the  Litchfield Theological College, and Prebendary of Litchfield Cathedral._      I fear it is impossible to deny, that in the early part of the  eighteenth century--amid the general coldness, languor, and want of  enthusiasm which characterized that effete epoch--\"the Church of  England, as well as all the dissenting bodies, slumbered and slept.\" At  this epoch, the Puritans were buried, and the Methodists were not born.  The Bishop of Litchfield, in a sermon delivered in 1724, said, \"The  Lord's Day is now the Devil's market day.\" In Litchfield Cathedral  Library is a copy of Dr. Balguy's Sermons, delivered in 1748, containing  on the fly-leaf an autograph remark by Bishop Bloomfield. It is in these  words, \"No Christianity here.\" It is said of that period of time, by a  noted minister of the Church of England, that a dry rationalism had  taken possession of the church, and that all the powers of her best  intellects were engaged in hot contests with Deists and Unitarians;  that an equally dry morality and stoical praise of \"Virtue\" formed the  chief part of the exhortations from the pulpit. It was just in these  times that the causes of the reformation of John Wesley sprang into  being. Seven biographies of John Wesley have already been written, and  the subject seems far from being exhausted even yet. As usual in such  cases it is the earlier publications which take the more sober view of  his character and history; while those of a later date surround their  hero with a halo of extravagant admiration. Alexander Knox, a personal  friend of Wesley's, thus writes of him: \"How was he competent to form a  religious polity so compact, effective and permanent? I can only express  my firm conviction that he was totally incapable of preconceiving such a  scheme. * * * * That he had uncommon acuteness in fitting expedients to  conjunctures is most certain; this, _in fact_, was his great talent.\"  (_Letter appended_ to Southey's Third Edition, 2, p. 428.) Methodism, at  the first, sprang up simply as a revival.    Half a century ago a distinguished Wesleyan wrote as follows: \"Though  Methodism stands now in a different relation to the establishment than  in the days of Mr. Wesley, _dissent_ has never been professed by the  body--and for obvious reasons: (1) A separation of a part of the society  from the church has not arisen from the principles assumed by the  professed Dissenters, and usually made so prominent in their discussions  on the subject of establishments. (2) A considerable number of our  members are actually in the communion of the Church of England to this  day. (3) To leave that communion is not, in any sense, a condition of  membership with us.\" (R. Watson's Observations, p. 156.)    \"What may we reasonably believe to be God's design in raising up the  preachers called Methodists? Not to form any new sect, but to reform the  nation, particularly the church; and to spread scriptural holiness over  the land.\" (Large Minutes of Conference, 1744-89, Qu. 3.) In the same,  Qu. 45, we have this answer: \"We are not seceders, nor do we bear any  resemblance to them. We set out upon quite opposite principles.\"  Southey says: \"Wesley had now proposed to himself a clear and  determinate object. He hoped to give a new impulse to the Church of  England, to awaken its dormant zeal, infuse life into a body where  nothing but life was wanting, and lead the way to the performance of  duties which the church had scandalously neglected.\" (Southey's Life, p.  193, ed. Bohn.)    Mr Curties says: \"A disastrous period of Wesleyanism opened with John  Wesley's voyage to America, in 1735. It was a mission nobly undertaken,  at the instance of Dr. Burton, of Corpus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28673"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#4)"],[1,"not  amputate--the _I_! The thief may escape from justice, but he can not  escape from the dishonest wretch--_himself_.    The murderer in America may flee to England or France, but through  conscious memory he is, and will forever be, compelled to keep company  with the murderous villain. He has this consciousness and will keep it  through eternity, even though he should be pardoned. Here, then, is  certain knowledge, more than seeing, hearing, or any other sense  belonging to the physical, for it is the conscious knowledge of that  which sees and hears, and which reaches out through the senses and  connects itself with the objective. It is therefore certain that, in  case there is no such thing as mental science, there is no such thing as  science at all, in all the realm of the universe; because the mind, in  the act of knowing, knows itself or is conscious of its own operations,  otherwise it could know nothing whatever, could not be mind.    Have we not the most certain evidence of the existence of mind? Is light  a certain evidence that there is light, or a source of light? Is not  reasoning a proof that there is something which reasons? Can there be  light without a cause? Can there be invention without an inventive  being? The mind is like a telescope in this respect, that it shows  itself in showing that about which it is occupied. The man who is  content to believe what he sees, hears, tastes, smells and feels, is  only a sensuous believer--an animal, and not a man. Reason's glory is  that it perceives the invisible.          OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO REVELATION--No. IV.    BY P.T. RUSSELL.      LANGUAGE AND RELIGION, FROM WHENCE?    There are conditions under which circumstantial evidence is the best  possible testimony. These conditions are found inseparably connected  with our present subject. That men now possess the same powers of body  and mind that they always manifested is disputed by no intelligent  individual. Those powers have been, through all the ages, precisely the  same both in number and kind. Has the history of humanity furnished a  single case in which a person, perfectly deaf during all his life, had  the ability to speak words? Such is unknown in the history of the past,  and also in the records of the present. History is as blank at this  point, as a barren oasis. All the other faculties are as perfect with  the deaf as they are with those whose hearing is perfect. Their  inventive genius is equally vigorous; this being true, why should the  defect of the ear deprive them of the power of speech? Will the Deist  answer this question? Mr. Skeptic, as you are in the same difficulty  with the Deist, you may help him if you choose. If you are, as you  pretend, free and fearless thinkers, give us your thoughts upon this  question. If you are cowardly, then stand off and sneer at the question  which you dare not try to answer. The facts developed at this point  ought to be remembered, and the question, why can the deaf, described,  never talk? ought to be pressed home to every heart.      MATHEMATICS WILL AID US HERE.    When we see a constant increase in the number of persons or things in an  undeviating ratio, with the aid of mathematics we can pass back to the  first of the series, to the first man living at the base of the human  series. Ever remember that there can not be a series without a unit  lying at its base.    Why do the life-long deaf never talk? You answer: All Adam's children  learn to talk by hearing others talk, and as those deaf ones never  heard, so they never learned to talk. Very well. The first man, at the  beginning of the series of humanity, had no powers or faculties which  his descendants do not possess, and as they all have been under the  necessity of learning to talk by hearing others talk, will you  unbelievers and skeptics tell us, if you can, how that first man became  a talker? Can the life-long deaf talk as well as those whose ears are  perfect? No. Well, then, the difficulty rests upon you. That you may  remember it, I will repeat it once more, it is this: who did the first  man hear in order to learn the talker's trade?      WHERE DID LANGUAGE COME FROM?    Do you tell us that society made language? Then society must be older  than language, for the maker is always, of necessity, older than the  thing made. But without language there could be no interchange of ideas,  and without this society could not exist. Where there is no intelligent  communication of ideas we never think of society. Society does not exist  where there is no intelligent communication of ideas between persons.  The trees in the grove are never spoken of as a society. They are not  and can not be in the social state. Neither are the brutes around us.  Man is the only being upon earth capable of becoming a constituent  element or part of society. Mr. Blair says, in his lectures on  Belleslettres, \"It would be extremely difficult to conceive how society  could exist without language.\" Now, as society can not exist without  language, it is certain that society could not be the author of  language, for the author must be older than his production. But Mr.  Blair springs another difficulty. It is in these words: \"It would be  equally difficult to conceive how language could exist without society.\"  A moment's reflection will satisfy all reasonable persons that language  can not exist without society, and that which can not exist without the  other can not be the maker--author--of the other, for the maker must be  older than the thing made. Then, as neither of these could exist without  the other, neither could be the author of the other. So language and  society are both effects, and their cause is outside of or antecedent to  both, for every effect has an antecedent cause.      WHO, OR WHAT, IS THAT CAUSE?    First, it must have existed before man. Second, it must have possessed  the powers of speech; and, therefore, must have been an intelligence. We  have already seen this in our reflections upon the fact that the  life-long deaf, who are deprived of hearing words spoken, are always  dumb; so man, if he had never heard words spoken, would have remained  dumb. He that created the ear, could He not hear? Did He not know what  He was doing? He that arranged the vocal powers of man, could He not  speak? Is there no evidence of an intelligent authorship here? He who  not only created but also endowed man with all His noble and God-like  attributes, would He not delight in visiting man and talking with him  and learning him the art of speech? Did man not have the privilege of  learning to talk? Did he not hear and learn from the \"ancient of  days\"--from his great author? Is it not unreasonable to suppose that the  author of man's being took no delight in him? _Without this_ the first  man could never have commanded the use of words. Here we have the  \"Arriere pensee\" clue, that is, the clue in mental reservation; and here  we meet the axiom. The clear is the true, and the \"Ariadne,\" the clue  that leads us out of the labyrinth. Language at the first must have been  specific. This, in the nature of the case, must have been true; that is,  each and every word must have been used in such a manner as to convey a  certain definite idea. As we have already seen how mathematics aid us in  passing back to the first man, so we can easily see how to reach an  approximate idea of his mental condition. Physiologically, he might have  been a full developed athlete, but in mentality, like the helpless  infant. He is at the first uneducated. True, he possesses powers of  mind, but they are inactive. No thought has passed through his mind to  wake him up. He opens his eyes and immediately he thinks, he hears, and  thought is increased. He is connected with the objective world of things  by means of the five senses, and his mind goes to work upon these. His  thoughts are all his own; he himself thought them; they were within his  reach. He saw and heard, but his thoughts, like yours and mine, did not  go beyond his perceivings. Yes, he wakes up and hears a rustling sound  in the air just above his head; looking up he discovers a pair of the  birds of Paradise flying over him; they light on the branch of a tree  near by. These were the first things seen; he saw them in the morning of  the first day of his life. He looks and looks, and thinks these birds  are older than himself, for he remembers having seen them at the moment  of the first consciousness. The question possible came up, Whence came  they, and all the other things which I now see and hear? Were they  always here? No answer is found. His curiosity is aroused; his reason  is perplexed; he _would be_ puzzled. He now reaches for thoughts too  high for him; neither bird, beast, nor any other part of all creation  can give the light he seeks. Whichever way he turns he receives no  answer; he is bewildered; he is now anxious for light and ready to  receive it. Man has found his extremity, and this is God's opportunity.  He visits man and talks to him, and man, hearing the speech of his  Creator, learns to talk. He is now able to ask for the solution of the  perplexing problem of the ages, From whence came all these beautiful and  useful things with which I am surrounded? Did they come of themselves,  or did somebody make and arrange them? Here the Lord drives away all his  troubles, simply saying: \"I created all these things; the earth and the  heavens, and all that is in them, the sun, moon and the stars also, and  I now place you here in this beautiful Eden, earth, to dress and keep  it.\" Thus man obtained the use of language and the foundation of  religion at the same time. Of this I will speak more at length in my  next. Tell them farewell.    N.B.--Let the determined skeptic answer these essays if he can, and if  he can not, let him be an honest man and surrender.
