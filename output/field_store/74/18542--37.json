Mr. Davy, who accompanied Colonel Cheney up the Euphrates, was for a  time in the service of Mehemet Ali Pacha. \"Pickwick\" happening to reach  Davy while he was at Damascus, he read a part of it to the Pacha, who  was so delighted with it, that Davy was, on one occasion, called up in  the middle of the night to finish the reading of the chapter in which  he and the Pacha had been interrupted. Mr. Davy read, in Egypt, upon  another occasion, some passages from these unrivalled \"Papers\" to a  blind Englishman, who was in such ecstasy with what he heard, that he  exclaimed he was almost thankful he could not see he was in a foreign  country; for that while he listened, he felt completely as though he  were again in England.--_Lady Chatterton._           *       *       *       *       *      SWIFT'S DISAPPOINTMENT.    \"I remember when I was a little boy, (writes Swift in a letter to  Bolingbroke,) I felt a great fish at the end of my line, which I  drew up almost on the ground, but it dropt in, and the disappointment  vexes me to this day; and I believe it was the type of all my future  disappointments.\"    \"This little incident,\" writes Percival, \"perhaps gave the first wrong  bias to a mind predisposed to such impressions; and by operating with  so much strength and permanency, it might possibly lay the foundation  of the Dean's subsequent peevishness, passion, misanthropy, and final  insanity.\"           *       *       *       *       *    LEIGH HUNT AND THOMAS CARLYLE.      The following characteristic story of these two \"intellectual  gladiators\" is related in \"A New Spirit of the Age.\"    Leigh Hunt and Carlyle were once present among a small party of equally  well known men. It chanced that the conversation rested with these two,  both first-rate talkers, and the others sat well pleased to listen.  Leigh Hunt had said something about the islands of the Blest, or El  Dorado, or the Millennium, and was flowing on in his bright and hopeful  way, when Carlyle dropt some heavy tree-trunk across Hunt's pleasant  stream, and banked it up with philosophical doubts and objections at  every interval of the speaker's joyous progress. But the unmitigated  Hunt never ceased his overflowing anticipations, nor the saturnine  Carlyle his infinite demurs to those finite flourishings. The listeners  laughed and applauded by turns; and had now fairly pitted them against  each other, as the philosopher of Hopefulness and of the Unhopeful. The  contest continued with all that ready wit and philosophy, that mixture  of pleasantry and profundity, that extensive knowledge of books and  character, with their ready application in argument or illustration,  and that perfect ease and good-nature, which distinguish each of these  men. The opponents were so well matched, that it was quite clear the  contest would never come to an end. But the night was far advanced, and  the party broke up. They all sallied forth; and leaving the close room,  the candles and the arguments behind them, suddenly found themselves in  presence of a most brilliant star-light night. They all looked up.  \"Now,\" thought Hunt, \"Carlyle's done for!--he can have no answer to  that!\" \"There!\" shouted Hunt, \"look up there! look at that glorious  harmony, that sings with infinite voices an eternal song of hope in the  soul of man.\" Carlyle looked up. They all remained silent to hear what  he would say. They began to think he was silenced at last--he was a  mortal man. But out of that silence came a few low-toned words, in a  broad Scotch accent. And who, on earth, could have anticipated what the  voice said? \"Eh! it's a _sad_ sight!\"----Hunt sat down on a stone step.  They all laughed--then looked very thoughtful. Had the finite measured  itself with infinity, instead of surrendering itself up to the influence?  Again they laughed--then bade each other good night, and betook  themselves homeward with slow and serious pace. There might be some  reason for sadness, too. That brilliant firmament probably contained  infinite worlds, each full of struggling and suffering beings--of beings  who had to die--for life in the stars implies that those bright worlds  should also be full of graves; but all that life, like ours, knowing not  whence it came, nor whither it goeth, and the brilliant Universe in its  great Movement having, perhaps, no more certain knowledge of itself,  nor of its ultimate destination, than hath one of the suffering specks  that compose this small spot we inherit.           *       *       *       *       *      COWPER'S POEMS.    Johnson, the publisher in St. Paul's Churchyard, obtained the copyright  of Cowper's Poems, which proved a great source of profit to him, in the  following manner:--One evening, a relation of Cowper's called upon  Johnson with a portion of the MS. poems, which he offered for  publication, provided Johnson would publish them at his own risk, and  allow the author to have a few copies to give to his friends. Johnson  read the poems, approved of them, and accordingly published them. Soon  after they had appeared, there was scarcely a reviewer who did not load  them with the most scurrilous abuse, and condemn them to the butter  shops; and the public taste being thus terrified or misled, these  charming effusions stood in the corner of the publisher's shop as an  unsaleable pile for a long time.    At length, Cowper's relation called upon Johnson with another bundle of  the poet's MS, which was offered and accepted upon the same terms as  before. In this fresh collection was the poem of the \"Task.\" Not alarmed  at the fate of the former publication, but thoroughly assured of the  great merit of the poems, they were published. The tone of the reviewers  became changed, and Cowper was hailed as the first poet of the age. The  success of this second publication set the first in motion. Johnson  immediately reaped the fruits of his undaunted judgment; and Cowper's  poems enriched the publisher, when the poet was in languishing  circumstances. In October, 1812, the copyright of Cowper's poems was put  up to sale among the London booksellers, in thirty-two shares. Twenty of  the shares were sold at 212_l._ each. The work, consisting of two octavo  volumes, was satisfactorily proved at the sale to net 834_l._ per annum.  It had only two years of copyright; yet this same copyright produced the  sum of 6764_l._           *       *       *       *       *      HEARNE'S LOVE OF ALE.    Thomas Warton, in his Account of Oxford, relates that at the sign of  Whittington and his Cat, the laborious antiquary, Thomas Hearne, \"one  evening suffered himself to be overtaken in liquor. But, it should be  remembered, that this accident was more owing to his love of antiquity  than of ale. It happened that the kitchen where he and his companion  were sitting was neatly paved with sheep's trotters disposed in various  compartments. After one pipe, Mr. Hearne, consistently with his usual  gravity and sobriety, rose to depart; but his friend, who was inclined  to enjoy more of his company, artfully observed, that the floor on which  they were then sitting was no less than an original tesselated Roman  pavement. Out of respect to classic ground, and on recollection that  the Stunsfield Roman pavement, on which he had just published a  dissertation, was dedicated to Bacchus, our antiquary cheerfully  complied; an enthusiastic transport seized his imagination; he fell on  his knees and kissed the sacred earth, on which, in a few hours, and  after a few tankards, by a sort of sympathetic attraction, he was  obliged to repose for some part of the evening. His friend was,  probably, in the same condition; but two printers accidentally coming  in, conducted Mr. Hearne, between them, to Edmund's Hall, with much  state and solemnity.\"           *       *       *       *       *      SHERIDAN'S WIT.    Sheridan's wit was eminently brilliant, and almost always successful; it  was, like all his speaking, exceedingly prepared, but it was skilfully  introduced and happily applied; and it was well mingled, also, with  humour, occasionally descending to farce. How little it was the  inspiration of the moment all men were aware who knew his habits; but a  singular proof of this was presented to Mr. Moore, when he came to write  his life; for we there find given to the world, with a frankness which  must have almost made their author shake in his grave, the secret  note-books of this famous wit; and are thus enabled to trace the jokes,  in embryo, with which he had so often made the walls of St. Stephen's  shake, in a merriment excited by the happy appearance of sudden  unpremeditated effusion.--_Lord Brougham._    Take an instance from this author, giving extracts from the common-place  book of the wit:--\"He employs his fancy in his narrative, and keeps his  recollections for his wit.\" Again, the same idea is expanded into \"When  he makes his jokes, you applaud the accuracy of his memory, and 'tis  only when he states his facts that you admire the flights of his  imagination.\" But the thought was too good to be thus wasted on the  desert air of a common-place book. So, forth it came, at the expense of  Kelly, who, having been a composer of music, became a wine-merchant.  \"You will,\" said the _ready_ wit, \"import your music and compose your  wine.\" Nor was this service exacted from the old idea thought sufficient;  so, in the House of Commons, an easy and, apparently, off-hand parenthesis  was thus filled with it, at Mr. Dundas's cost and charge, \"who generally  resorts to his memory for his jokes, and to his imagination for his  facts.\"           *       *       *       *       *      SMOLLETT'S HISTORY OF ENGLAND.    This man of genius among trading authors, before he began his History  of England, wrote to the Earl of Shelburne, then in the Whig  Administration, offering, if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/304"],[0,"Rio Grande's Last Race, and Other Verses (#4)"],[1,"Saltbush rode before --    Old Rooster Hall was a blithesome man, when he thought of the treat in store.    They reached the camp, where the drover's cook, with countenance all serene,    Was boiling beef in an iron pot, but never a fowl was seen.      'Take off the beef from the fire,' said Bill,      'and wait till you see the fight;    There's something fresh for the bill-of-fare --      there's game-fowl stew to-night!    For Mister Hall has a fighting cock, all feathered and clipped and spurred;    And he's fetched him here, for a bit of sport, to fight our Australian bird.    I've made a match that our pet will win, though he's hardly a fighting cock,    But he's game enough, and it's many a mile      that he's tramped with the travelling stock.'    The cook he banged on a saucepan lid; and, soon as the sound was heard,    Under the dray, in the shadows hid, a something moved and stirred:    A great tame Emu strutted out.  Said Saltbush, 'Here's our bird!'    But Rooster Hall, and his cronies two, drove home without a word.      The passing stranger within his gates that camps with old Rooster Hall    Must talk about something else than fowls, if he wishes to talk at all.    For the record lies in the local Court, and filed in its deepest vault,    That Peter Hall, of the Take 'Em Down, was tried for a fierce assault    On a stranger man, who, in all good faith, and prompted by what he heard,    Had asked old Hall if a British Game could beat an Australian bird;    And old McCrae, who was on the Bench, as soon as the case was tried,    Remarked, 'Discharged with a clean discharge -- the assault was justified!'          Hay and Hell and Booligal          'You come and see me, boys,' he said;    'You'll find a welcome and a bed     And whisky any time you call;    Although our township hasn't got    The name of quite a lively spot --     You see, I live in Booligal.      'And people have an awful down    Upon the district and the town --     Which worse than hell itself they call;    In fact, the saying far and wide    Along the Riverina side     Is \"Hay and Hell and Booligal\".      'No doubt it suits 'em very well    To say it's worse than Hay or Hell,     But don't you heed their talk at all;    Of course, there's heat -- no one denies --    And sand and dust and stacks of flies,     And rabbits, too, at Booligal.      'But such a pleasant, quiet place,    You never see a stranger's face --     They hardly ever care to call;    The drovers mostly pass it by;    They reckon that they'd rather die     Than spend a night in Booligal.      'The big mosquitoes frighten some --    You'll lie awake to hear 'em hum --     And snakes about the township crawl;    But shearers, when they get their cheque,    They never come along and wreck     The blessed town of Booligal.      'But down in Hay the shearers come    And fill themselves with fighting-rum,     And chase blue devils up the wall,    And fight the snaggers every day,    Until there is the deuce to pay --     There's none of that in Booligal.      'Of course, there isn't much to see --    The billiard-table used to be     The great attraction for us all,    Until some careless, drunken curs    Got sleeping on it in their spurs,     And ruined it, in Booligal.      'Just now there is a howling drought    That pretty near has starved us out --     It never seems to rain at all;    But, if there SHOULD come any rain,    You couldn't cross the black-soil plain --     You'd have to stop in Booligal.'           .    .    .    .    .      'WE'D HAVE TO STOP!'  With bated breath    We prayed that both in life and death     Our fate in other lines might fall:    'Oh, send us to our just reward    In Hay or Hell, but, gracious Lord,     Deliver us from Booligal!'          A Walgett Episode          The sun strikes down with a blinding glare,     The skies are blue and the plains are wide,    The saltbush plains that are burnt and bare     By Walgett out on the Barwon side --    The Barwon river that wanders down    In a leisurely manner by Walgett Town.      There came a stranger -- a 'Cockatoo' --     The word means farmer, as all men know    Who dwell in the land where the kangaroo     Barks loud at dawn, and the white-eyed crow    Uplifts his song on the stock-yard fence    As he watches the lambkins passing hence.      The sunburnt stranger was gaunt and brown,     But it soon appeared that he meant to flout    The iron law of the country town,     Which is -- that the stranger has got to shout:    'If he will not shout we must take him down,'    Remarked the yokels of Walgett Town.      They baited a trap with a crafty bait,     With a crafty bait, for they held discourse    Concerning a new chum who of late     Had bought such a thoroughly lazy horse;    They would wager that no one could ride him down    The length of the city of Walgett Town.      The stranger was born on a horse's hide;     So he took the wagers, and made them good    With his hard-earned cash -- but his hopes they died,     For the horse was a clothes-horse, made of wood! --    'Twas a well-known horse that had taken down    Full many a stranger in Walgett Town.      The stranger smiled with a sickly smile --     'Tis a sickly smile that the loser grins --    And he said he had travelled for quite a while     In trying to sell some marsupial skins.    'And I thought that perhaps, as you've took me down,    You would buy them from me, in Walgett Town!'      He said that his home was at Wingadee,     At Wingadee where he had for sale    Some fifty skins and would guarantee     They were full-sized skins, with the ears and tail    Complete, and he sold them for money down    To a venturesome buyer in Walgett Town.      Then he smiled a smile as he pouched the pelf,     'I'm glad that I'm quit of them, win or lose:    You can fetch them in when it suits yourself,     And you'll find the skins -- on the kangaroos!'    Then he left -- and the silence settled down    Like a tangible thing upon Walgett Town.          Father Riley's Horse          'Twas the horse thief, Andy Regan, that was hunted like a dog     By the troopers of the Upper Murray side,    They had searched in every gully -- they had looked in every log,     But never sight or track of him they spied,    Till the priest at Kiley's Crossing heard a knocking very late     And a whisper 'Father Riley -- come across!'    So his Rev'rence in pyjamas trotted softly to the gate     And admitted Andy Regan -- and a horse!      'Now, it's listen, Father Riley, to the words I've got to say,     For its close upon my death I am to-night.    With the troopers hard behind me I've been hiding all the day     In the gullies keeping close and out of sight.    But they're watching all the ranges till there's not a bird could fly,     And I'm fairly worn to pieces with the strife,    So I'm taking no more trouble, but I'm going home to die,     'Tis the only way I see to save my life.      'Yes, I'm making home to mother's, and I'll die o' Tuesday next     An' be buried on the Thursday -- and, of course,    I'm prepared to meet my penance, but with one thing I'm perplexed     And it's -- Father, it's this jewel of a horse!    He was never bought nor paid for, and there's not a man can swear     To his owner or his breeder, but I know,    That his sire was by Pedantic from the Old Pretender mare     And his dam was close related to The Roe.      'And there's nothing in the district that can race him for a step,     He could canter while they're going at their top:    He's the king of all the leppers that was ever seen to lep,     A five-foot fence -- he'd clear it in a hop!    So I'll leave him with you, Father, till the dead shall rise again,     'Tis yourself that knows a good 'un; and, of course,    You can say he's got by Moonlight out of Paddy Murphy's plain     If you're ever asked the breeding of the horse!      'But it's getting on to daylight and it's time to say good-bye,     For the stars above the East are growing pale.    And I'm making home to mother -- and it's hard for me to die!     But it's harder still, is keeping out of gaol!    You can ride the old horse over to my grave across the dip     Where the wattle bloom is waving overhead.    Sure he'll jump them fences easy -- you must never raise the whip     Or he'll rush 'em! -- now, good-bye!' and he had fled!      So they buried Andy Regan, and they buried him to rights,     In the graveyard at the back of Kiley's Hill;    There were five-and-twenty mourners who had five-and-twenty fights     Till the very boldest fighters had their fill.    There were fifty horses racing from the graveyard to the pub,     And their riders flogged each other all the while.    And the lashins of the liquor!  And the lavins of the grub!     Oh, poor Andy went to rest in proper style.      Then the races came to Kiley's -- with a steeplechase and all,     For the folk were mostly Irish round about,    And it takes an Irish rider to be fearless of a fall,     They were training morning in and morning out.    But they never started training till the sun was on the course     For a superstitious story kept 'em back,    That the ghost of Andy Regan on a slashing chestnut horse,     Had been training by the starlight on the track.      And they read the nominations for the races with surprise     And amusement at the Father's little joke,    For a novice had been entered for the steeplechasing prize,     And they found that it was Father Riley's moke!    He was neat enough to gallop, he was strong enough to stay!     But his owner's views of training were immense,    For the Reverend Father Riley used to ride him every day,     And he never saw a hurdle nor a fence.      And the priest would join the laughter; 'Oh,' said he, 'I put him in,     For there's five and twenty sovereigns to be won.    And the poor would find it useful, if the chestnut chanced to win,     And he'll maybe win when all is"]]]
