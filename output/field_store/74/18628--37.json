Prof. D. E. Lantz states that this species in the vicinity of Manhattan,  Kansas, exhibits the same familiarity as the Flicker, the Red-headed and  Downy Woodpeckers. About a dozen nests were observed, the excavations  ranging usually less than twenty feet from the ground. One nest in a  burrow of a large dead limb of an elm tree was found May 12, and  contained five eggs. The birds are very much attached to their nests. If  the nest is destroyed by man or beast, the birds almost immediately  begin excavating another nest cavity for the second set, always in the  vicinity of the first nest, often in the same tree.    In its search for food, the \"Zebra Bird,\" regardless of the presence of  man, climbs in its usual spiral or zigzag manner the trees and their  branches boldly uttering now and then its familiar _chaw, chaw_, darting  off occasionally to catch a passing insect upon the wing. Its flight is  undulating, and its habits in many respects are like those of the  Red-headed, but it is not so much of an upland bird, or lover of berries  and fruits, and therefore more respected by the farmer. In contest with  the Red-head it is said to be invariably vanquished.    The North American family of Woodpeckers--consisting of about  twenty-five species--is likely to be brought together in BIRDS for the  first time. We have already presented several species, and will figure  others as we may secure the finest specimens. Occasionally a foreign  Woodpecker will appear. About three hundred and fifty species are known,  and they are found in all the wooded parts of the world except Australia  and Madagascar.          A FORCED PARTNERSHIP.      A pair of Robins had made their nest on the horizontal branch of an  evergreen tree which stood near a dwelling house, and the four young had  hatched when a pair of English Sparrows selected the same branch for  their nest. When the Robins refused to vacate their nest, the Sparrows  proceeded to build theirs upon the outside of the Robin's nest. To this  the Robins made no objection, so both families lived and thrived  together on the same branch, with nests touching. The young of both  species developed normally, and in due time left their nests. The branch  bearing both nests is now preserved in the college museum.--_Oberlin  College Bulletin._          WHAT IS AN EGG?      How many people crack an egg, swallow the meat, and give it no further  thought. Yet, to a reflective mind the egg constitutes, it has been  said, the greatest wonder of nature. The highest problems of organic  development, and even of the succession of animals on the earth, are  embraced here. \"Every animal springs from an egg,\" is a dictum of Harvey  that has become an axiom.    In an egg one would suppose the yolk to be the animal. This is not so.  It is merely food--the animal is the little whitish circle seen on the  membrane enveloping the yolk.    We hope to group a number of eggs, to enable our readers to compare  their size and shape, from that of the Epyornis, six times the size of  an Ostrich egg, down to the tiny egg that is found in the soft nest of  the Humming-bird. This gigantic egg is a foot long and nine inches  across, and would hold as much as fifty thousand Humming-bird's eggs.          THE SAW-WHET OWL.        \"The Lark is but a bumpkin fowl;        He sleeps in his nest till morn;      But my blessing upon the jolly Owl        That all night blows his horn.\"      A curious name for a bird, we are inclined to say when we meet with it  for the first time, but when we hear its shrill, rasping call note,  uttered perhaps at midnight, we admit the appropriateness of \"saw-whet.\"  It resembles the sound made when a large-toothed saw is being filed.    Mr. Goss says that the natural home of this sprightly little Owl is  within the wild woodlands, though it is occasionally found about farm  houses and even cities. According to Mr. Nelson, it is of frequent  occurrence in Chicago, where, upon some of the most frequented streets  in the residence portion of the city, a dozen specimens have been taken  within two years. It is very shy and retiring in its habits, however,  rarely leaving its secluded retreats until late at eve, for which reason  it is doubtless much more common throughout its range than is generally  supposed. It is not migratory but is more or less of an irregular  wanderer in search of food during the autumn and winter. It may be quite  common in a locality and then not be seen again for several years. It is  nocturnal, seldom moving about in the day time, but passing the time in  sleeping in some dark retreat; and so soundly does it sleep that  ofttimes it may be captured alive.    The flight of the Saw-whet so closely resembles that of the Woodcock  that it has been killed by sportsmen, when flying over the alders,  through being mistaken for the game bird.    These birds nest in old deserted squirrel or Woodpecker holes and small  hollows in trees. The eggs--usually four--are laid on the rotten wood or  decayed material at the bottom. They are white and nearly round.    In spite of the societies formed to prevent the killing of birds for  ornamenting millinery, and the thousands of signatures affixed to the  numerous petitions sent broadcast all over the country, in which women  pledged themselves not to wear birds or feathers of any kind on their  hats, this is essentially a bird killing year, and the favorite of all  the feathers is that of the Owl. There is an old superstition about him  too. He has always been considered an unlucky bird, and many persons  will not have one in the house. He may, says a recent writer, like the  Peacock, lose his unlucky prestige, now that Dame Fashion has stamped  him with her approval. Li Hung Chang rescued the Peacock feather from  the odium of ill luck, and hundreds of persons bought them after his  visit who would never permit them to be taken inside their homes prior  to it. So the Owl seems to have lost his ill luck since fair woman has  decided that the Owl hat is \"the thing.\"    The small size of the Saw-whet and absence of ears, at once distinguish  this species from any Owl of eastern North America, except Richardson's,  which has the head and back spotted with white, and legs barred with  grayish-brown.          THE SAW-WHET OWL.      \"Whew!\" exclaims Bobbie. \"Here's another Owl. I never knew there were so  many different species, mamma.\"    Mamma smiled at that word \"species.\" It was a word Bobbie had learned in  his study of BIRDS.    \"The _Saw-whet Owl_,\" said she, looking at the picture. \"A good looking  little fellow, but not handsome as the Snowy Owl in the June number of  BIRDS.\"    \"He _was_ a beauty,\" assented Bobbie, \"such great yellow eyes looking at  you out of a snow bank of feathers. This little fellow's feet have on  black shoes with yellow soles, not white fur overshoes like the _Snowy  Owl's_.\"    \"His eyes glow like topaz, though, just as the others did,\" said mamma.  \"Let us see what he says about himself.    \"As stupid as an Owl. That's the way some people talk about us. Then  again I've heard them say, 'tough as a b'iled owl.' B'iled Owls may be  tough, I don't know anything about that, for I have been too shy and  wary to be caught.    \"I had a neighbor once who was very fond of chickens. He was a Night Owl  and said he found it easy to catch them when roosting out at night. Well  he caught so many that Mr. Owl grew very fat, and the farmer whose  chickens he ate, caught, cooked, and ate him. His flesh, the farmer  said, was tender and sweet. So, my little friends, when you want to call  anything 'tough,' don't mention the Owl any more.    \"A foreigner?    \"Oh, my, no! I'm proud to say I am an American, and so are all my folks.  A branch of the family, however, lives way up north in a region where  they sing 'God save the Queen' instead of the 'Star Spangled Banner.'  They call themselves English Owls, I guess, because they live on British  soil.    \"Do I sing?    \"Well, not exactly. I can hoot though, and my _Ah-ee, ah-ee_, _ah-oo,  ah-oo_, has a pleasant sound, very much like filing a saw. That is the  reason they call me the Saw-whet Owl. My mate says it doesn't sound that  way to her, but then as she hasn't any ears maybe she doesn't hear very  well.    \"You never see me out in the day time, no indeed! I know when the mice  come out of their holes; I am very fond of mice, also insects. I like  small birds, too--to eat--but I find them very hard to catch.    \"Don't you?\"     [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences.                  SAW-WHET OWL.

White Swans are very common, common as white Geese. I only  wish I could have had my picture taken while gliding through the water.  I am so stately and handsome there. My feet wouldn't have shown either.    Really I don't think my feet are pretty. They always remind me when I  look down at them of a windmill or the sails of a vessel. But if they  hadn't been made that way, webbed-like, I wouldn't be able to swim as I  do. They really are a pair of fine paddles, you know.    There was a time when people in certain countries thought a Black Swan  was an impossibility. As long as there were black sheep in the world, I  don't see why there shouldn't have been Black Swans, do you?    Well, one day, a Dutch captain exploring a river in Australia, saw and  captured four of the black fellows. That was way back in sixteen hundred  and something, so that one of those very Black Swans must have been my  great, great, great, _great_ grandfather. Indeed he may have been even  greater"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3434"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#4)"],[1," of  by the fact, that only two of his contemporaries are mentioned in the entire  volume, and that Muhammad's name occurs but five times, although he is all  the way through addressed by the Angel Gabriel as the recipient of the divine  revelations, with the word SAY. Perhaps such passages as Sura ii. 15, p. 339,  and v. 246, p. 365, and the constant mention of guidance, direction,  wandering, may have been suggested by reminiscences of his mercantile  journeys in his earlier years.    It may be considered quite certain that it was not customary to reduce to  writing any traditions concerning Muhammad himself for at least the greater  part of a century. They rested entirely on the memory of those who have  handed them down, and must necessarily have been coloured by their prejudices  and convictions, to say nothing of the tendency to the formation of myths and  to actual fabrication, which early shews itself, especially in  interpretations of the Koran, to subserve the purposes of the contending  factions of the Ommeyads and Abbâsides. It was under the 5th Caliph, Al-  Mâmûn, that three writers (mentioned below) on whom we mainly depend for all  really reliable information, flourished: and even their writings are  necessarily coloured by the theological tendencies of their master and  patron, who was a decided partizan of the divine right of Ali and of his  descendants. The incidents mentioned in the Koran itself, for the  interpretation of which early tradition is available, are comparatively few,  and there are many passages with which it is totally at variance; as, for  instance, that Muhammad worked miracles, which the Koran expressly disclaims.  Traditions can never be considered as at all reliable, unless they are  traceable to some common origin, have descended to us by independent  witnesses, and correspond with the statements of the Koran itselfalways of  course deducting such texts as (which is not unfrequently the case) have  themselves given rise to the tradition. It soon becomes obvious to the reader  of Muslim traditions and commentators that both miracles and historical  events have been invented for the sake of expounding a dark and perplexing  text; and that even the earlier traditions are largely tinged with the  mythical element.    The first biographer of Muhammad of whom we have any information was Zohri,  who died A.H. 124, aged 72; but his works, though abundantly quoted by later  writers, are no longer extant. Much of his information was derived from Orwa,  who died A.H. 94, and was a near relative of Ayesha, the prophet's favourite  wife.    Ibn Ishaq, who died in A.H. 151, and who had been a hearer of Zohri, composed  a Biography of Muhammad for the use of the Caliph Al Mánsûr. On this work,  considerable remains of which have come down to us, Ibn Hisham, who died A.H.  213, based his Life of Muhammad.    Waquidi of Medina, who died A.H. 207, composed a biographical work, which has  reached us in an abbreviated form through his secretary (Katib). It is  composed entirely of traditions.    Tabari, \"the Livy of the Arabians\" (Gibbon, 51, n. 1), who died at Baghdad  A.H. 310, composed annals of Muhammad's life and of the progress of Islam.    These ancient writers are the principal sources whence anything like  authentic information as to the life of Muhammad has been derived. And it may  be safely concluded that after the diligent investigations carried on by the  professed collectors of traditions in the second century after the Hejira,  that little or nothing remains to be added to our stores of information  relative to the details of Muhammad's life, or to facts which may further  illustrate the text of the Koran. But however this may be, no records which  are posterior in date to these authorities can be considered as at all  deserving of dependance. \"To consider,\" says Dr. Sprenger, \"late historians  like Abulfeda as authorities, and to suppose that an account gains in  certainty because it is mentioned by several of them, is highly uncritical.\"  Life of Mohammad, p. 73.    The sources whence Muhammad derived the materials of his Koran are, over and  above the more poetical parts, which are his own creation, the legends of his  time and country, Jewish traditions based upon the Talmud, or perverted to  suit his own purposes, and the floating Christian traditions of Arabia and of  S. Syria. At a later period of his career no one would venture to doubt the  divine origin of the entire book. But at its commencement the case was  different. The people of Mecca spoke openly and tauntingly of it as the work  of a poet, as a collection of antiquated or fabulous legends, or as palpable  sorcery.4 They accused him of having confederates, and even specified  foreigners who had been his coadjutors. Such were Salman the Persian, to whom  he may have owed the descriptions of Heaven and Hell, which are analogous to  those of the Zendavesta; and the Christian monk Sergius, or as the  Muhammadans term him, Boheira. From the latter, and perhaps from other  Christians, especially slaves naturalised at Mecca, Muhammad obtained access  to the teaching of the Apocryphal Gospels, and to many popular traditions of  which those Gospels are the concrete expression. His wife Chadijah, as well  as her cousin Waraka, a reputed convert to Christianity, and Muhammad's  intimate friend, are said to have been well acquainted with the doctrines and  sacred books both of Jews and Christians. And not only were several Arab  tribes in the neighbourhood of Mecca converts to the Christian faith, but on  two occasions Muhammad had travelled with his uncle, Abu Talib, as far as  Bostra, where he must have had opportunities of learning the general outlines  of Oriental Christian doctrine, and perhaps of witnessing the ceremonial of  their worship. And it appears tolerably certain that previous to and at the  period of his entering into public life, there was a large number of  enquirers at Mecca, who like Zaid, Omayah of Taief, Waraka, etc., were  dissatisfied equally with the religion of their fathers, the Judaism and the  Christianity which they saw around them, and were anxiously enquiring for  some better way. The names and details of the lives of twelve of the  \"companions\" of Muhammad who lived in Mecca, Medina, and Taief, are recorded,  who previous to his assumption of the Prophetic office, called themselves  Hanyfs, i.e., converts, puritans, and were believers in one God, and regarded  Abraham as the founder of their religion. Muhammad publicly acknowledged that  he was a Hanyfand this sect of the Hanyfites (who are in no way to be  confounded with the later sect of the same name) were among his Meccan  precursors. See n. pp. 209, 387. Their history is to be found in the Fihrist  MS. Paris, anc. fonds, nr. 874 (and in other treatises)which Dr. Sprenger  believes to have been in the library of the Caliph El-Mâmûn. In this  treatise, the Hanyfs are termed Sabeites, and said to have received the  Volumes (Sohof) or Books of Abraham, mentioned in Sura lxxxvii. 19, p. 40,  41, which most commentators affirm to have been borrowed from them, as is  also the case with the latter part of Sura liii. 37, ad f. p. 71; so that  from these \"Books\" Muhammad derived the legends of Ad and Themoud, whose  downfall, recent as it was (see note p. 300), he throws back to a period  previous to that of Moses, who is made to ask (Sura xiv. 9, p. 226) \"whether  their history had reached his hearers.\" Muhammad is said to have discovered  these \"Books\" to be a recent forgery, and that this is the reason why no  mention of them occurs after the fourth year of his Prophetic function, A.D.  616. Hence too, possibly, the title Hanyf was so soon dropped and exchanged  for that of Muslim, one who surrenders or resigns himself to God. The Waraka  above mentioned, and cousin of Chadijah, is said to have believed on Muhammad  as long as he continued true to the principles of the Hanyfs, but to have  quitted him in disgust at his subsequent proceedings, and to have died an  orthodox Christian.    It has been supposed that Muhammad derived many of his notions concerning  Christianity from Gnosticism, and that it is to the numerous gnostic sects  the Koran alludes when it reproaches the Christians with having \"split up  their religion into parties.\" But for Muhammad thus to have confounded  Gnosticism with Christianity itself, its prevalence in Arabia must have been  far more universal than we have any reason to believe it really was. In fact,  we have no historical authority for supposing that the doctrines of these  heretics were taught or professed in Arabia at all. It is certain, on the  other hand, that the Basilidans, Valentinians, and other gnostic sects had  either died out, or been reabsorbed into the orthodox Church, towards the  middle of the fifth century, and had disappeared from Egypt before the sixth.  It is nevertheless possible that the gnostic doctrine concerning the  Crucifixion was adopted by Muhammad as likely to reconcile the Jews to Islam,  as a religion embracing both Judaism and Christianity, if they might believe  that Jesus had not been put to death, and thus find the stumbling-block of  the atonement removed out of their path. The Jews would in this case have  simply been called upon to believe in Jesus as being what the Koran  represents him, a holy teacher, who, like the patriarch Enoch or the prophet  Elijah, had been miraculously taken from the earth. But, in all other  respects, the sober and matter-of-fact statements of the Koran relative to  the family and history of Jesus, are altogether opposed to the wild and  fantastic doctrines of Gnostic emanations, and especially to the manner in  which they supposed Jesus, at his Baptism, to have been brought into union  with a higher nature. It is quite clear that Muhammad borrowed in several  points from the doctrines of the Ebionites, Essenes, and Sabeites."]]]
