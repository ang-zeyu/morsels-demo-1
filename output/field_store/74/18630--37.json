I could hardly restrain a shudder as I realized the  theatric quality of the lady's appearance, and I honestly dreaded the  possible consequences of her visit. We live in a tolerably censorious  age, and I did not care to be seen in the company of such a peroxidized  vision as she appeared to be.    \"I am afraid, madam,\" said I, shrinking back against the wall as she  approached--\"I am very much afraid that you have got into the wrong  house. Mr. Slatherberry, the theatrical manager, lives next door.\"    She paid no attention to this observation, but, holding out a compelling  hand, bade me come along with her, her voice having about it all the  musical charm of an oboe suffering from bronchitis.    \"Not in a year of Sundays I won't!\" I retorted. \"I am a respectable man,  a steady church-goer, a trustee for several philanthropic institutions,  and a Sunday-School teacher. I don't wish to be impolite, but really,  madam, rich as I am in reputation, I am too poor to be seen in public  with you.\"    \"I am a spirit,\" she began.    \"I'll take your word for it,\" I interjected, and I could see that she  told the truth, for she was entirely diaphanous, so much so indeed that  one could perceive the piano in the other room with perfect clarity  through her intervening shadiness. \"It is, however, the unfortunate  fact that I have sworn off spirits.\"    \"None the less,\" she returned, her eye flashing and her hand held forth  peremptorily, \"you must come. It is your predestined doom.\"    My next remark I am not wholly clear about, but, as I remember it, it  sounded something like \"I'll be doomed if I do!\" whereupon she  threatened me.    \"It is useless to resist,\" she said. \"If you decline to come  voluntarily, I shall hypnotize you and force you to follow me. We have  need of you.\"    \"But, my dear lady,\" I pleaded, \"please have some regard for my  position. I never did any of you spirits any harm. I've treated every  visitor from the spirit-land with the most distinguished consideration,  and I feel that you owe it to me to be regardful of my good name.  Suppose you take a look at yourself in yonder looking-glass, and then  say if you think it fair to compel a decent, law-abiding man, of  domestic inclinations like myself, to be seen in public with--well, with  such a looking head of hair as that of yours.\"    My visitor laughed heartily.    \"Oh, if that's all,\" she said, most amiably, \"we can arrange matters in  a jiffy. Your wife possesses a hooded mackintosh, does she not? I think  I saw something of the kind hanging on the hat-rack as I floated in. I  will wear that if it will make you feel any easier.\"    \"It certainly would,\" said I; \"but see here--can't you scare up some  other cavalier to escort you to the haven of your desires?\"    She fixed a sternly steady eye upon me for a moment.    \"Aren't you the man who wrote the lines,        The World's a green and gladsome ball,      And Love's the Ruler of it all,      And Life's the chance vouchsafed to me      For Deeds and Gifts of Sympathy?    Didn't you write that?\" she demanded.    \"I did, madam,\" said I, \"and I meant every word of it, but what of it?  Is that any reason why I should be seen on a public highway with a  lady-ghost of your especial kind?\"    \"Enough of your objections,\" she retorted firmly. \"You are the person  for whom I have been sent. We have a case needing your immediate  attention. The only question is, will you come pleasantly and of your  own free will, or must I resort to extreme measures?\"    These words were spoken with such determination that I realized that  further resistance was useless, and I yielded.    \"All right,\" said I. \"On your way. I'll follow.\"    \"Good!\" she cried, her face wreathing with a pleasant little nile-green  smile. \"Get the mackintosh, and we'll be off. There's no time to lose,\"  she added, as the clock in the tower on the square boomed out the hour  of three.    \"What is this anyhow?\" I demanded, as I helped her on with the  mackintosh and saw that the hood covered every vestige of that awful  coiffure. \"Another case of Scrooge?\"    \"Sort of,\" she replied as, hooking her arm in mine, she led me forth  into the night.      II    We passed over to Fifth Avenue, and proceeded uptown at a pace which  reminded me of the active gait of my youth. My footsteps had grown  unwontedly light, and we covered the first ten blocks in about three  minutes.    \"We don't seem to be headed for the slums,\" I panted.    \"Indeed, we are not,\" she retorted. \"There is no need of carrying coals  to Newcastle on this occasion. This isn't a slum case. It's far more  acute than that.\"    A tear came forth from her eye and trickled down over the mackintosh.    \"It is a peculiarity of modern effort on behalf of suffering humanity,\"  she went on, \"that it is concentrated upon the relief of the misery of  the so-called _sub_merged, to the utter neglect of the often more  poignant needs of the _e_merged. We have workers by the thousand in the  slums, doing all that can be done, and successfully too, to relieve the  unhappy condition of the poor, but nobody ever seems to think of the  sorrows of the starving hundreds on upper Fifth Avenue.\"    \"See here, madam,\" said I, stopping suddenly short under a lamp-post in  front of the Public Library, \"I want to tell you right now that if you  think you are going to take me into any of the homes of the hopelessly  rich at this hour of the morning, you are the most mightily mistaken  creature that ever wore a psyche-knot. Why, great heavens, my dear lady,  suppose the owner of the house were to wake up and demand to know what I  was doing there at this time of night? What could I say?\"    \"You have gone on slumming parties, haven't you?\" she demanded coldly.    \"Often,\" said I. \"But that's different.\"    \"Why?\" she asked, with a simplicity that baffled me. \"Is it any worse  for you to intrude upon the home of a Fifth Avenue millionaire than it  is to go unasked into the small, squalid tenement of some poor sweatshop  worker on the East Side?\"    \"Oh, but it's different,\" I protested. \"I go there to see if there is  anything I can do to relieve the unhappy condition of the persons who  live in the slums.\"    \"No doubt,\" said she. \"I'll take your word for it, but is that any  reason why you should neglect the sufferers who live in these marble  palaces?\"    As she spoke, she hooked hold of my arm once more, and in a moment we  were climbing the front door steps of a palatial residence. The house  showed a dark and forbidding front at that hour in the morning despite  its marble splendors, and I was glad to note that the massive grille  doors of wrought iron were heavily barred.    \"It's useless, you see. We're locked out,\" I ventured.    \"Indeed?\" she retorted, with a sarcastic smile, as she seized my hand in  her icy grip and literally pulled me after her through the marble front  of the dwelling. \"What have we to do with bolts and bars?\"    \"I don't know,\" said I ruefully, \"but I have a notion that if I don't  bolt I'll get the bars all right.\"    I could see them coming, and they were headed straight for me.    \"All you have to do is to follow me,\" she went on, as we floated upward  for two flights, paying but little attention to the treasures of art  that lined the walls, and finally passed into a superbly lighted salon,  more daintily beautiful than anything of the kind I had ever seen  before.    \"Jove!\" I ejaculated, standing amazed in the presence of such luxury and  beauty. \"I did not realize that with all her treasures New York held  anything quite so fine as this. What is it, a music-room?\"    \"It is the nursery,\" said my companion. \"Look about you and see for  yourself.\"    I did as I was bidden, and such an array of toys as that inspection  revealed! Truly it looked as if the toy-market in all sections of the  world had been levied upon for tribute. Had all the famous toy emporiums  of Nuremberg itself been transported thither bodily, there could not  have been playthings in greater variety than there greeted my eye. From  the most insignificant of tin-soldiers to the most intricate of  mechanical toys for the delectation of the youthful mind, nothing that I  could think of was missing.    The tin-soldiers as ever had a fascination for me, and in an instant I  was down upon the floor, ranging them in their serried ranks, while the  face of my companion wreathed with an indulgent smile.    \"You'll do,\" said she, as I loaded a little spring-cannon with a stub of  a lead-pencil and bowled over half a regiment with one well-directed  shot.    \"These are the finest tin-soldiers I ever saw!\" I cried with  enthusiasm.    \"Only they're not tin,\" said she. \"Solid silver, every man-jack of  them--except the officers--they're made of platinum.\"    \"And will you look at that little electric railroad!\" I cried, my eye  ranging to the other end of the salon. \"Stations, switches,  danger-signals, cars of all kinds, and even miniature Pullmans, with  real little berths that can be let up and down--who is the lucky kid  who's getting all these beautiful things?\"    \"Sh!\" she whispered, putting her finger to her lips. \"He is coming--go  on and play. Pretend you don't see him until he speaks to you.\"    As she spoke, a door at the far end of the apartment swung gently open,  and a little boy tiptoed softly in. He was a golden-haired little chap,  and I fell in love with his soft, dreamy eyes the moment my own rested  upon them. I could not help glancing up furtively to see his joy over  the discovery of all these wondrous possessions, but alas, to my  surprise, there was only an unemotional stare in his eyes as they swept  the aggregation of childish treasures. Then, on a sudden, he saw me,  squatting on the floor, setting up again the army of silver warriors.    \"How do you do?\" he said gently, but with just a touch of weariness in  his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34479"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 1 (of 6) (#4)"],[1,"of  examples I shall add no more: should any one be desirous also of  precepts under every school, he will find them given, not indeed by me,  but by those who have written more ably on the art, and whom I have  diligently consulted with regard to different masters, as I shall  hereafter mention.    My third object was to facilitate an acquaintance with the various  styles of painting. The artist or amateur indeed, who has studied the  manner of all ages and of every school, on meeting with a picture can  very readily assign it, if not to a particular master, at least to a  certain style, much as antiquarians, from a consideration of the paper  and the characters, are enabled to assign a manuscript to a particular  era; or as critics conjecture the age and place in which an anonymous  author flourished, from his phraseology. With similar lights we proceed  to investigate the school and era of artists; and by a diligent  examination of prints, drawings, and other relics belonging to the  period, we at length determine the real author. Much of the uncertainty,  with regard to pictures, arises from a similitude between the style of  different masters: these I collect together under one head, and remark  in what one differs from the other. Ambiguity often arises from  comparing different works of the same painter, when the style of some of  them does not seem to accord with his general manner, nor with the great  reputation he may have acquired. On account of such uncertainty, I  usually point out the master of each artist, because all at the outset  imitate the example offered by their teachers; and I, moreover, note the  style formed, and adhered to by each, or abandoned for another manner; I  sometimes mark the age in which he lived, and his greater or less  assiduity in his profession. By an attentive consideration of such  circumstances, we may avoid pronouncing a picture spurious, which may  have been painted in old age, or negligently executed. Who, for  instance, would receive as genuine all the pictures of Guido, were it  not known that he sometimes affected the style of Caracci, of Calvart,  or of Caravaggio; and at other times pursued a manner of his own, in  which, however, he was often very unequal, as he is known to have  painted three or four different pieces in a single day? Who would  suppose that the works of Giordano were the production of the same  artist, if it were not known that he aspired to diversify his style, by  adopting the manner of various ancient artists? These are indeed well  known facts, but how many are there yet unnoted that are not unworthy of  being related, if we wish to avoid falling into error? Such will be  found noticed in my work, among other anecdotes of the various masters,  and the different styles.    I am aware that to become critically acquainted with the diversity of  styles is not the ultimate object to which the travels and the eager  solicitude of the connoisseur aspire. His object is to make himself  familiar with the handling of the most celebrated masters, and to  distinguish copies from originals. Happy should I be, could I promise to  accomplish so much! Even they might consider themselves fortunate, who  dedicate their lives to such pursuits, were they enabled to discover any  short, general, and certain rules for infallibly determining this  delicate point! Many rely much upon history for the truth. But how  frequently does it happen that the authority of an historian is cited in  favour of a family picture, or an altar-piece, the original of which  having been disposed of by some of the predecessors, and a copy  substituted in its place, the latter is supposed to be a genuine  painting! Others seem to lay great stress on the importance of places,  and hesitate to raise doubts respecting any specimen they find contained  in royal and select galleries, assuming that they really belong to the  artists referred to in the gallery descriptions and catalogues. But here  too they are liable to mistake; inasmuch as many private individuals, as  well as princes, unable to purchase ancient pictures at any price,  contented themselves with such copies of their imitators as approached  nearest to the old masters. Some indeed were made by professors  purposely despatched by princes in search of them; as in the instance of  Rodolph I., who employed Giuseppe Enzo, a celebrated copyist. (See  Boschini, p. 62, and Orlandi, on Gioseffo Ains di Berna.) External  proofs, therefore, are insufficient, without adding a knowledge of  different manners. The acquisition of such discrimination is the fruit  only of long experience, and deep reflection on the style of each  master: and I shall endeavour to point out the manner in which it may be  obtained.[15]    To judge of a master we must attend to his design, and this is to be  acquired from his drawings, from his pictures, or, at least, from  accurate engravings after them. A good connoisseur in prints is more  than half way advanced in the art of judging pictures; and he who aims  at this must study engravings with unremitting assiduity. It is thus his  eye becomes familiarized to the artist's method of delineating and  foreshortening the figure, to the air of his heads and the casting of  his draperies; to that action, that peculiarity of conception, of  disposing, and of contrasting, which are habitual to his character. Thus  is he, as it were, introduced to the different families of youths, of  children, of women, of old men, and of individuals in the vigour of  life, which each artist has adopted as his own, and has usually  exhibited in his pictures. We cannot be too well versed in such matters,  so minute or almost insensible are the distinctions between the  imitators of one master, (such as Michelangiolo, for example,) who have  perhaps studied the same cartoon, or the same statues, and, as it were,  learned to write after the same model.    More originality is generally to be discovered in colouring, a branch of  the art formed by a painter rather on his own judgment, than by  instruction. The amateur can never attain experience in this branch who  has not studied many pictures by the same master; who has not observed  his selection of colours, his method of separating, of uniting, and of  subduing them; what are his local tints, and what the general tone that  harmonizes the colours he employs. This tint, however clear and silvery  in Guido and his followers, bright and golden in Titiano and his school,  and thus of the rest, has still as many modifications as there are  masters in the art. The same remark extends to middle tints and to  chiaroscuro, in which each artist employs a peculiar method.    These are qualities which catch the eye at a distance, yet they will not  always enable the critic to decide with certainty; whether, for  instance, a certain picture is the production of Vinci, or Luini, who  imitated him closely; whether another be an original picture by Barocci,  or an exact copy from the hand of Vanni. In such cases judges of art  approach closer to the picture with a determination to examine it with  the same care and accuracy as are employed in a judicial question, upon  the recognition of hand-writing. Fortunately for society, nature has  granted to every individual a peculiar character in this respect, which  it is not easy to counterfeit, nor to mistake for any other person's  writing. The hand, habituated to move in a peculiar manner, always  retains it: in old age the characters may be more slowly traced, may  become more negligent or more heavy; but the form of the letters remains  the same. So it is in painting. Every artist not only retains this  peculiarity, but one is distinguished by a full charged pencil; another  by a dry but neat finish; the work of one exhibits blended tints, that  of another distinct touches; and each has his own manner of laying on  the colours:[16] but even in regard to what is common to so many, each  has a peculiar handling and direction of the pencil, a marking of his  lines more or less waved, more or less free, and more or less studied,  by which those truly skilled from long experience are enabled, after a  due consideration of all circumstances, to decide who was the real  author. Such judges do not fear a copyist, however excellent. He will,  perhaps, keep pace with his model for a certain time, but not always; he  may sometimes shew a free, but commonly a timid, servile, and meagre  pencil; he will not be long able, with a free hand, to keep his own  style concealed under the manner of another, more especially in regard  to less important points, such as the penciling of the hair, and in the  fore- and back-grounds of the picture.[17] Certain observations on the  canvas and the priming ground may sometimes assist inquiry; and hence  some have endeavoured to attain greater certainty by a chemical analysis  of the colours. Diligence is ever laudable when exerted on a point so  nice as ascertaining the hand-work of a celebrated master. It may  prevent our paying ten guineas for what may not be worth two; or placing  in a choice collection pictures that will not do it credit; while to the  curious it affords scientific views, instead of creating prejudices that  often engender errors. That mistakes should happen is not surprising. A  true connoisseur is still more rare than a good artist. His skill is the  result of only indirect application; it is acquired amidst other  pursuits, and divides the attention with other objects; the means of  attaining it fall to the lot of few; and still fewer practise it  successfully. Among the number of the last I do not reckon myself. By  this work I pretend not, I repeat it, to form an accomplished  connoisseur in painting: my object is to facilitate and expedite the  acquisition of such knowledge. The history of painting is the basis of  connoisseurship; by combining it, I supersede the necessity of referring  to"]]]
